<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image recording
system having therein a halftone dot image data producing
apparatus which produces halftone dot image data and outputs
them, an image recording apparatus which records a halftone
dot image on a photosensitive material in accordance with
halftone dot image data, and a halftone dot image data storing
apparatus which stores halftone dot image data produced by the
halftone dot image data producing apparatus and outputs the
halftone dot image data to the image recording apparatus, and
to the halftone dot image data storing apparatus.In recent years, due to popularization of desk top
publishing, there have been generalized an operation wherein
images inputted from a scanner are subjected to image editing
on a software of a computer and are paginated, and editing on
a full digital basis has lost its novelty. In the process of this sort, there are conducted image
setter output wherein page-edited image data are directly
outputted on a film, CTP (computer to plate) output wherein
image recording is directly conducted on a printing plate, and
CTC (computer to cylinder) wherein image recording is directly
carried out on a printing plate which is wound around a
cylinder of a printing machine, all for improving efficiency.In this case, when output on a film or output on a
printing plate is conducted only for confirmation of
proofreading, and printing proofreading and other proofreading
with other materials are conducted, there is caused a problem
that films and printing plates are wasted and extra works are
required.Accordingly, in the process of this kind wherein image
forming and image editing on a full digital basis are
conducted by a computer, in particular, there is demanded a
system to directly conduct color image output which is called
DDCP (direct digital color proof).In such DDCP, a color proof which reproduces output
shown by digital image that is processed on a computer is
prepared to confirm a pattern, an image color, a composition
and letters and characters, before recording on a plate-making
film with an image setter from digital image data processed on
a computer, or before conducting final printing work to 
prepare a printing plate directly by CTP, or before conducting
image recording with CTC directly on a printing plate wound
around a cylinder of a printing machine.In the process of proofreading in this printing process,
a color proof is prepared and used for the following three
applications.
1) Confirmation of errors in a job site, namely
