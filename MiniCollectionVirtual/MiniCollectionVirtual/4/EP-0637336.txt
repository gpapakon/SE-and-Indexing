<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the general area of
medical genetics and in the fields of biochemical engineering
and immunochemistry. More specifically, it relates to the
identification of a new gene--the MN gene--a cellular gene
coding for the MN protein. The inventors hereof found MN
proteins to be associated with tumorigenicity. Identification
of MN antigen as well as antibodies specific therefor in
patient samples provides the basis for diagnostic/prognostic
assays for cancer.MaTu is a novel quasi-viral agent with rather
unusual properties [Zavada, J., Arch. Virol, 50: 1-10
(1976)]. It is presumably derived from a human mammary tumor.
In some respects, it resembles classical viruses whereas in
other respects, it resembles "slow" viruses (prions), and in
still other respects it is different from both classes of
viruses.MaTu was first detected by its capacity to
complement mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with
heat-labile surface G protein in HeLa cells (cell line derived
from human cervical adenocarcinoma), which had been
cocultivated with human breast carcinoma cells. The
complementation resulted in the formation of phenotypically
mixed virions--the VSV(MaTu) pseudotypes [Zavada et al.,
Nature New Biol. 240: 124-125 (1972)]. The virions contain
the VSV genome, which is responsible for their ability to
produce plaques (as well as internal VSV proteins), but the
surface protein, corresponding to MaTu, determines their host
range and neutralization specificities.One of the paradoxical features of the MaTu agent is
its host range. VSV(MaTu) is infectious only for human
fibroblasts, but not for HeLa; however, the MaTu agent,
detected by its capacity to donate surface protein for the
VSV(MaTu) pseudotypes, is transmissible only to HeLa, but not 
to fibroblasts [Zavada et al., J. Gen. Virol.. 24: 327-337
(1974)].By its complementation of VSV mutants and by its
formation of pseudotypes, MaTu resembles known enveloped
viruses. However, MaTu is transmissible only by direct cell-to-cell
contact, and not by cell-free filtrates, thus
differing from both classical and "slow" viruses. Its only
permissive host appears to be HeLa cells. In those cells,
MaTu spreads extremely slowly, and does not form
morphologically distinct virions, thus resembling the "slow"
viruses. [Zavada et al., (1974); Zavada and Zavadova, Arch.
Virol, 118: 189-197 (1991)]. No known virus has HeLa cells
as an exclusive host.Since the above-described properties suggest that
MaTu might be an entirely new type of molecular parasite of
liv
