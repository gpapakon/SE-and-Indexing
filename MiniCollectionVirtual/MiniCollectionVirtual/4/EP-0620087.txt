<ABSTRACT>
Method for perforating films, characterised in that it consists mainly in the fact that successive series of perforations are made by means of heated sleeve tubes (10); the small discs (32) cut out are grasped; and these small discs (32) are moved away from the film (2) in this way, so that they are actually cut away.

Method for perforating films whereby successive series
of perforations are made by cutting means (10), whereby

parts of the thus perforated film are caught and removed
by gripping means (20) and, if necessary, are blown away

from said means (20), characterized in that sleeves are
used as cutting means (10) which are heated, such that

these sleeves go through the film like a heated knife and
cut small slices out of the film which are caught by

means of bushes (20) provided with a passage (23) that is
Successively put into contact with a vacuum pump, with

compressed air respectively.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
film is carried between two cylinders (4-5) that are made

to turn against one another, one of which (4) is provided
with the heated sleeves (10) which protrude out of the

cylinder wall (4), whereas the second cylinder (5) is
provided with holes (19) in which the sleeves (10) enter

during the rotation of the cylinders (4-5) and in which
the bushes (20) are placed, whereby each bush (20) is

connected to a tube (21), the passage (23) in said bush
being linked to a groove (22) provided in said tube (21),

whereby the tube (21) extends to an end flange (25) of
the cylinder (5), the groove (22) being connected to a

passage (24) provided in said end flange (25) of the
cylinder (5).
Device for perforating films which mainly consists of 
two cylinders (4-5) which turn against one another, one

of which (4) is equipped with means (10) to cut out parts
of the film (2), whereas the second cylinder (5) is

equipped with means (20) which can catch the cut-out
parts, characterized in that the means for cutting out

parts are heated sleeves (10) which go through the
external wall of the first cylinder (4) and cut out small

slices (32), whereas the second cylinder (5) is provided
with holes (19) in which the sleeves (10) enter during

the rotation of the cylinders (4-5), whereby the means to
catch the cut-out parts and thus the small cut-out slices

(32) are provided with bushes (20) placed in said holes
(19) which can be successively connected to a vacuum

pump, compressed air respectively, each bush (20) being
connected to a tube (21) and having a passage (23) which

is linked to a groove (22) provided in said tube (21),
whereby the tube (21) extends to an end flange (25) of

the cylinder (5), the groove (22) being connected to a
passage (24) provided in said end flange (25) of the

cylinder (5).
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the
sleeves (10) are placed in holes (9) provided in the wall

(8), whereby these holes (9) are larger than the
corresponding dimensions of the sleeves (10) and whereby

the sleeves (10) of one and the same row are fixed on a
common lath (11) in which is provided a heating element

(12).
Device according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in
that the sleeves (10) are fixed in the tubular cylinder

(4) by means of screws (16) and nuts (17), in which is
provided a feeble thermal isolation material (15) between

the internal wall of the tube (8) and each lath (11). 
Device according to any of claims 3 to 5,
characterized in that the dimensions of a bush (20) are

significantly smaller than the internal dimensions of a
sleeve (10).
Device according to any of claims 3 to 6,
characterized in that the above-mentioned end flange (25)

in which are provided passages (24), rests against a
fixed flange (29) in which are provided two circular

notches (30) and (31), one of which works in conjunction
with a suction mechanism, for example a vacuum pump,

whereas the other works in conjunction with a compressed
air supply mechanism.
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the
circular notches (30) and (31) form an angle of 90Â° and

are placed diametrically in relation to one another, the
suction notch being placed on top.
