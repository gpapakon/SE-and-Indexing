<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disperse dye
composition and a method for dyeing hydrophobic fibers
with it. Particularly, it relates to a blue disperse dye
composition having an excellent exhaustion property and a
method for dyeing hydrophobic fibers with it. More
particularly, it relates to a disperse dye composition
which is stable against metal ions in the dye bath and
which is suitable for dyeing relatively hardly dyeable
polyester fibers so-called Shin-Gosen (modified
polyester-containing fibers) with a deep color, and a
dyeing method employing it.To dye hydrophobic fibers such as polyester fibers
with a deep blue color, it is common to employ a disperse
dye in a large amount of at least 4% o.w.f. for the
dyeing. If a dye is used in such a high concentration,
the concentration of the dye remaining in the waste water
from the dyeing will accordingly be high, whereby it 
tends to be difficult to reuse the water, and the COD
value of the waste water will also be high. Further,
there are many items desired to be improved in the dyeing
of modified polyester fibers so-called Shin-Gosen which
have shown remarkable commercial development recently.For example, regarding ultrafine micro fibers and
differential shrinkage combined yarn, studies are being
made on deep color dyeing and a dyeing method not to
impair feeling of fibers.It is an object of the present invention to dye
synthetic fibers such as polyester fibers with a deep
blue color.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a dyeing method whereby the concentration of the dye
remaining in the waste water from the dyeing can be
minimized, so that recycling of the dyeing solution can
be facilitated.A further object of the present invention is to
provide a dye composition and a dyeing method suitable
for dyeing Shin-Gosen products such as fine denier
polyester fibers or differential shrinkage combined yarn-type
polyester fiber products.The present invention provides a disperse dye
composition comprising compounds of the formulae (I) and
(II):

wherein X1 is a chlorine atom, X2 is a halogen atom, each of R1and R5 is a
methyl group or an ethyl group, and each of R2, R3 and R4 is a C1-5alkyl group,
wherein the weight ratio of the compound of the formula (I) to the compound of
the formula (II) is within the range of from 95:5 to 5:95, and a method for
dyeing hydrophobic fibers with such a disperse dye composition.
Now, the present invention will be described in detail.
The disperse dyes of the above formulae (I) and (II) are known compounds
