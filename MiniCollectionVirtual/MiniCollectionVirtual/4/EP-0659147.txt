<ABSTRACT>
A goblet device is disclosed for fitting to a drinks container (10) having a cylindrical body (12) closed at the top by a lid (16) crimped to a collar (14) extending said cylindrical body, the crimped joint forming an annular bead (18) extending externally to said collar. The device comprises a cylindrical sidewall (32) with an inside diameter substantially the same as the outside diameter of said container and a bottom (34), the connecting zone (36) between said bottom and said sidewall being fitted internally with means for snap fitting the goblet device onto the bead of said container. Said snap-on means consist of an annular groove (40) which can receive said bead, and at least one elastically deformable extension (42, 44) projecting from the outer periphery (40a) of said groove to extend into the latter to co-operate with the face (18a) of said bead turned towards said cylindrical body when the goblet device is fitted to the container.
