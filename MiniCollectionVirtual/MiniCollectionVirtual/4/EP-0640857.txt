facilitation of positioning of an optical fiber, 
simplification of the structure of an actuator, 

improvements in assembly operability and reliability of 
the apparatus, facilitation of an application to a 

multi-core structure, facilitation of alignment of a 
plurality of optical fibers, and the like. A 

displacement stage (5) for mounting a single optical fiber 
(2) thereon, an elevating stage (20) for mounting a plurality 

of second optical fibers (3) thereon in a lateral line, and 
a linear encoder (14) for controlling a coil motor (9) are 

disposed in a case (1). The displacement stage (5) is

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in
the structure of an optical switch for switching the
optical path of an optical fiber.As is well known, an optical switch is an optical
device for switching the optical path of an optical fiber
along the time axis or spatially, and is widely utilized
in the fields of optical communication, optical
information, applied optical measurement, and the like.The fields of optical communication, optical
information, applied optical measurement, and the like
have made remarkable developments in recent years. Along
with these developments, an optical circuit has become
more and more complicated and has advanced functions.
Accordingly, further downsizing is demanded for an
optical device.Optical switches briefly described above are usually
classified into mechanical type optical switches
disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Nos. 1-99016, 55-43540, and 55-25023, US-5056886, and
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 54-28160 and 2-149806, and
non-mechanical type optical switches. An optical switch disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 1-99016 has a mechanical structure in which
a selecting connector is fitted to the distal end portion
of a single optical fiber, and selected connectors are
fitted to the distal end portions of a plurality of
optical fibers arranged in a matrix.The optical switch having the above arrangement has
a function of arbitrarily selecting one connector
selected from the plurality of connectors to be selected
and thereafter moving the selecting connector in the X-,
Y-, and Z-directions and fitting and connecting it to the
one opposing connector to be selected, thereby switching
the optical path of the optical fiber.The optical switches disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Nos. 55-43540 and 55-25023, and US-5056886 have
a mechanical structure in which the optical path of a
fiber is switched by using a mirror, a prism, and the
like.The optical switch disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 54-28160 is constituted by a single optical
fiber which is bent due to use of an electrostrictive
material, and a plurality of optical fibers disposed in a
substantially fan-shaped manner and each having one end
portion directed to the distal end portion of the
opposing single optical fiber.This optical switch has a function of arbitrarily 
selecting one optical fiber from the plurality of optical
fibers, bending the single optical fiber with use of the
electrostrictive material, and thereafter connecting the
distal end portion of the single optical
