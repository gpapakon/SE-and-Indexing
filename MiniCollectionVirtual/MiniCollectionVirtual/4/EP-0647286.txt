<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a heated roller for material in continuous-web form, in particular paper. The roller has a cylindrical body with at least one flanged neck (12) and fitted with at least one inlet and one outlet line (24) for a heating fluid, in particular steam. Several lines or bores (16) running at least approximately parallel to each other and located preferably at the roller surface carry the heating fluid through the body of the roller. The invention calls for at least one reservoir (28) to be provided inside the roller to hold the condensate formed by condensation of the heating fluid.

<CLAIMS>
A heating or heated roll (10) for web-type materials,
more particularly paper, comprising


a cylindrical roll body (14),
at least one flanged trunnion (12),
at least one feed or drain conduit (36) for steam,
several passages (16) arranged at least approximately
axially-parallel, preferably peripheral for directing

the steam through said roll body (14), and
connecting conduits (24) for the steam to said passages
(16),

characterized in that

said roll body (14) is made as a chill casting,
one collecting space (28) each is configured at each
end of each peripheral passage (16) within said heating

roll (10) for receiving the condensate resulting from
condensation of the steam,
each collecting space (28) is assigned a condensate

drain conduit (26) and that
a flow obstacle, more particularly an axial displacement
(38) of said collecting space (28) from the centerline

of the passage or retention means, for example
check valves, prevents flow off of the condensate

via said connecting conduits (24).
The heating roll as set forth in claim 1, characterized
in that said condensate drain conduit (26) assigned

to each collecting space (28) is provided in the
form of a passage or tube. 
The heating roll as set forth in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that a conduit (20) is provided more particularly

within said roll body (14) for guiding the steam to
an other end of said heating roll (10) or of said roll

body (14).
The heating roll as set forth in any of the claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the amount of condensate

drained can be regulated preferably via a valve means.
The heating roll as set forth in any of the claims 1
to 4, characterized in that at least one of said passages

(16) is oriented either inclined towards the middle and
axis of said roll more particularly deviates from the

axial-parallelness by approximately 1 to 10 mm, or extends
precisely axially-parallel.
The heating roll as set forth in any of the claims 1
to 5, characterized in that at least one of said collecting

spaces (28) comprises at at least one end of said
passages (16) a round pocket (28) having a diameter which

is preferably smaller than the diameter of said peripheral
passage (16), said pocket (28) being displaced outwardly

relative to said passage (16).
The heating roll as set forth in any of the claims 1
to 6, characterized in that temperature control can be implemented

by regulating the vapor pressure, preferably
with subsequent moistening of the vapor.
The heating roll as set forth in any of the claims 1
to 7, characterized in that at least six peripheral passages

(16) are arranged at least approximately axially-parallel. 
The heating roll as set forth in any of the claims 1
to 8, characterized in that a retention means, preferably

a check valve, flaps traps or the like for holding back
the condensate is arranged in said connecting conduits

(24) at the end portions of each passage (16).
The heating roll as set forth in any of the claims 1
to 9, characterized in that said end portions of said passages

(16) are provided with a thermally insulating material.
The heating roll as set forth in any of the claims 1
to 10, characterized in that at least one constriction

(38) is provided in the end portions of each at least
approximately axially-parallel passage (16) for holding

back the condensate, more particularly in roll standstill.
