<ABSTRACT>
A suction catheter assembly for aspiration of thrombi and emboli from blood vessels has a central catheter (2) and an external catheter (1) surrounding the latter coaxially. For insertion of the catheter arrangement into a vessel and for dilating it, there are a guide wire (4) and a dilator (3). Removal of a blood clot is effected via reduced pressure applied on to the central catheter (2). If the central catheter (2) is blocked by the blood clot during aspiration of the latter the central catheter (2) can be pulled out of the external catheter (1) and replaced by a new central catheter (2). This new central catheter (2) can be connected to the aspiration device, and the process can be continued. Instead of inserting a new central catheter (2) the aspiration process can also be continued through the external catheter (1) by connecting it to the aspiration device after removal of the central catheter (2).

Suction catheter arrangement for removing thrombi
and emboli from blood vessels by continuous suctioning,

having a central catheter (2) which is designed to
receive an axially displaceable dilator (3) and an outer

catheter (1) which coaxially surrounds the central
catheter (2), the suction catheter arrangement being

designed for continous suctioning of thrombi and emboli,
and the central catheter (2) has, during the continuous

suctioning, an internal diameter which remains constant
up to its distal end, and the distal end of the outer

catheter (1) can be pushed as far as the distal end of
the central catheter (2), and the external diameter of

the outer catheter (1) is only slightly greater than that
of the central catheter (2), so that the cross-section

available for the suctioning corresponds approximately to
the cross-section of the outer catheter (1).
Suction catheter arrangement according to Claim
1, characterized in that the outer catheter (1) has, in

the area of its proximal end, a connection part (13) by
means of which the outer catheter (1) can be connected to

a suction device (20).
Suction catheter arrangement according to Claim
1 or 2, characterized in that the outer catheter (1) and

the central catheter (2) have, in the area of their
proximal ends, in each case a haemostatic valve (11, 14).
Suction catheter arrangement according to Claim
3, characterized in that the haemostatic valve (11, 14)

is fixed detachably to the connection part (10, 13).
Suction catheter arrangement according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that a plurality

of outer catheters (1, 1a) are provided and are arranged
co-axially to the central catheter (2).
Suction catheter arrangement according to Claim
5, characterized in that in each case the external

diameter of the inside outer catheter (1) corresponds at
least approximately to the internal diameter of the outer

catheter (1a) next outside.
Suction catheter arrangement according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the catheters

(1, 1a, 2) consist of Teflon.
Suction catheter arrangement according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that a dilator (3)

is provided which is designed to be received in a central
catheter (2) and has a tip (7) which, with its axis,

forms an angle relative to the axis of the shaft (8), and
in that the tip (7) of the dilator (3) can be turned by

turning the dilator in different directions.
Suction catheter arrangement according to Claim
9, characterized in that the tip (7) of the dilator (3)

can be bent, with its axis remaining at an angle relative
to the axis of the shaft (8), and in that the tip (7) can

be turned by turning the dilator (3) in different directions.
Suction catheter arrangement according to Claim
8 or 9, characterized in that a guide wire (4) is guided

in the dilator (3).
