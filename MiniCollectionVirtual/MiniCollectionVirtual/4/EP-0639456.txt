<ABSTRACT>
To provide for communication between various areas of the printing process such as, for example, between preliminary printing stage and printing machine in both directions so that data for controlling the printing machine can be obtained from machine-independent data and the data to be printed from the preliminary printing stage can be influenced by the printing machine itself, a communication method and an associated device are proposed, the device exhibiting a communication structure which is built up out of a central main data processing station (4), with which a number of printing units (1, 2, 3) of the printing machine can be networked to form a linkage for common job preparation, and one decentralised data processing substation (5, 6) each per area of the printing process which, in turn, can be connected to the main data processing station (4). The connection between the substations (5, 6) and the station (4) is to be established by means of machine-independent interfaces (7, 8) which allow a data exchange in both directions.

Communication procedure for controlling the 
printing process of a printing machine in a 

communications system with a computer controlled data 
transfer, having printing units of the printing machine 

with individual control units and a communications 
structure for connecting printing machines and areas of 

the printing process operating independently of these, 

characterised in that
 a data exchange of equipment-independent 
and printing-machine-specific digital data 

is carried out at least between a data-processing 
substation (5) of a pre-printing stage and a main data-processing 

station (4) connected to the electric 
control units (20, 21, 22) of the printing machine (1, 

2, 3), in the form of preset data and characteristic 
communication in both directions between the pre-printing 

stage and the printing machine (1, 2, 3) and 
the main data-processing station (4) and a data-processing 

substation (6) of a product planning system 
(PPS) in the form of an operational and job data 

communication in both directions between the main data-processing 
station (4) and the PPS, so that data 

requests can be served in both directions irrespective 
of type and data for controlling the printing machine 

(1, 2, 3) can be obtained from machine type independent 
data, particularly from the pre-printing stage, and the 

data to be printed from the pre-printing stage can be 
influenced by the printing machine (1, 2, 3) itself, in 

such a way that the main data-processing station (4) is 
filled on the one hand with data gathered from the pre-printing 

stage (composition, reproduction, make-up, 
platemaking) for pre-setting the printing machine (1, 

2, 3) and influences the data there in their 
characteristic features, particularly in dependence on  

 
characteristic curves, and on the other hand the data 

output of the pre-printing stage, e.g. on film or 
plate, of the printing machine (1, 2, 3) is controlled 

by the main data-processing station (4), and that on 
the one hand the operational data of the printing 

machine (1, 2, 3) are transferred and on the other hand 
job data, which are raised in the PPS, are retrieved 

from the main data-processing station (4) for preparing 
the printing machine. 
Communication procedure according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the data of the pre-printing 

stage are pre-processed and condensed in a suitable way 
for the printing machine (1, 2, 3), but independently 

of the machine type, and the ink slide positions are 
calculated from this condensed data with the inclusion 

of printing-machine-specific data. 
Communication procedure according to claim 1, 
characterised in that a gradual decolourisation of an 

offset-printing unit is compensated for over the 
cylinder circumference, in that a characteristic curve 

or family of characteristics, whose values change 
continually in dependence on the distance of the 

subject section from the print start called up by the 
main data-processing station (4), the changes to the 

values themselves being derived from the respective 
machine parameters. 
Communication procedure according to claim 1, 
characterised in that ghosting, which appears if a 

large quantity of ink is taken up by an area, this area 
being adjacent to one with low ink absorption and the 

two areas being served by the same ink slide, is 
balanced out in that a family of characteristics, which 

takes into account both the machine parameters and the  
 

subject by underinking the dark areas and overinking 
the light areas, is delivered to the pre-printing stage 

from the main data-processing station (4). 
Communication procedure according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the printing process is 

controlled, particularly mechanically, by means of
