<ABSTRACT>
A device for producing a good electrical contact between a rotating cylindrical component and at least one conductor which is stationary in terms of rotation, includes   - at least one conductor guide mounted around the rotary cylinder to be applied so as to be driven in rotation with it and make a practically friction-free good electrical contact with it, - at least one contact which is fixed so tht it cannot rotate and in which there are crimped members supplied by the current generator, and which fixed contact is designed to be applied against the rotary guide so as to transmit the electrical current to it with high efficiency, practically without friction and without heating, and - means for applying this fixed contact against the rotary guide, the means being such as an element acting as a spring and a compression element which can move along the rotary cylinder to be supplied and which is intended to be fixed securely to the latter.   A rotary component can thus be supplied with high current densities greater than several hundred amperes per cm

. This type of contact may advantageously be used for supplying an electrically conducting rotating spindle mounted on an EDM machining head with high-density machining current, practically without heating.
