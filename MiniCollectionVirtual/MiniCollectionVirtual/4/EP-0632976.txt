<ABSTRACT>
An umbrella comprising a central shank, and a canopy 
arranged at the upper end of the shank, which canopy 

is arranged in such a way that it can be opened by 
means of ribs and that when the canopy is opened, ends 

of the ribs define points in the canopy, wherein the 
canopy consists of two layers (2,3) each of these 

layers (2,3) having the same number of ribs (4,5) and 
wherein the two layers of the canopy (2,3) can be 

rotated from a first position (A), in which the layers 
and ribs are substantially in alignment to a second 

position (B) in which the ribs (4 or 5) of one of the 
layers lie between the ribs (5 or 4) of the other 

layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an umbrella. Umbrellas for protection against the rain or the sun are 
available in a wide variety of forms, none of which offers 
the possibility of changing the shape of the umbrella in a 
simple way. The present invention relates therefore to an umbrella 
which can be altered in shape. The umbrella covered by this invention consists of the 
usual central shank, along which the umbrella can be 
opened. There is a normal handle or another device for 
holding the umbrella at the lower end of this shank. The 
canopy covered by this invention is similar to the canopy 
normally used in umbrellas, but consists of two layers, it 
being possible to adjust the elements of each layer to be 
approximately in alignment. It is an advantage that a 
normal opening mechanism is used to open the umbrella. it 
is also an advantage that the layers of the canopy are of 
approximately the same size to enable a symmetrical form 
consisting of n points to be transformed into one  
 
consisting of 2n points, whereby n is a natural number â‰§ 3, 
normally not greater than 5 and preferably 4. It is an advantage that the umbrella is constructed in such 
a way that all the ribs underneath the lower layer are so 
arranged that they can be actuated by a reliably 
functioning mechanism, and also that this mechanism ensures 
that the pressure exerted by the ribs when the umbrella is 
fully opened produces close contact between the two layers 
of the canopy, so that there is no significant space 
between the layers after they have been rotated. it is 
also an advantage that the lower layer is rotatable against 
the upper layer, as this makes it possible to attach the 
upper layer in the normal way to the upper end of the shank 
to produce a weatherproof seal. It is especially advantageous that all the ribs of the 
umbrella are directly actuated by one opening mechanism, as 
this guarantees that both layers will be taut when opened. 
The opening mechanism should preferably be a normal 
automatic mechanism. it is also an advantage for the ribs 
of the rotatable layer (preferably the lower layer) to be 
hinged on to the opening mechanism, as this type of hinged 
attachment is more simple to construct than one which 
rotates around the shank, e.g. by using the hinged joint on 
the shank which is a fundamental structural element.  Figure 1Shows the umbrella of the invention viewed from 
below; Figure 2Shows the umbrella of Figure 1 viewed from above;

<CLAIMS>
An umbrella comprising a central shank, and a canopy 
arranged at the upper end of the shank, which canopy 

is arranged in such a way that it can be opened by 
means of ribs and that when the canopy is opened, ends 

of the ribs define points in the canopy, wherein the 
canopy consists of two layers (2,3) each of these 

layers (2,3) having the same number of ribs (4,5) and 
wherein the two layers of the canopy (2,3) can be 

rotated from a first position (A), in which the layers 
and ribs are substantially in alignment to a second 

position (B) in which the ribs (4 or 5) of one of the 
layers lie between the ribs (5 or 4) of the other 

layer. 
An umbrella as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
umbrella further comprises an opening mechanism (9) 

which actuates all the ribs (4,5). 
An umbrella as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
all the ribs (4,5) are situated underneath the lower 

layer of the canopy (2). 
An umbrella as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the lower layer (2) of the canopy can 

 
be rotated against the upper layer (3). 
An umbrella as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein either one or both of the two layers 

are rotatable and the ribs (4 or 5) of the rotatable 
layer or layers (2 or 3) are hinged on to the opening 

mechanism (9).
