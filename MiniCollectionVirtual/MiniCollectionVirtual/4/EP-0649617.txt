<ABSTRACT>
The height adaptor unit is esp. designed for use in a piece of furniture. It has a socket retainer (3) which acts a retainer and also prevents retraction. The socket retainer is formed as a hollow cylinder with a closed end (3.7). It has toothed parts (3.1) connected to the cylinder by inclined flexures (3.2) which act as a set of sprag clutches. The teeth are of sawtooth shape, sliding over matching sawtooth-shaped teeth in a socket shaped so that they cannot be withdrawn.

A device for fixing plinth facings or like cladding sections for compartmented
furniture, particularly for kitchen cabinets and with, adapted to be braced on one furniture

part, an adaptor piece (2) of synthetic plastics material in particular and which comprises
a shaped adaptor recess (5) with fixing projections (7) for variable-height disposition of

a plinth facing holder (3) provided with integrally moulded catches (8), whereby the plinth
facing holder (3) is secured by the fixing projections (7) and the integrally moulded

catches (8) from moving forwards and cross-wise to the plinth facing, is constructed as
a holding-down clamp with a safeguard against resetting, has two multi-stage catch

profilings (3.1) which are provided on both sides of the vertical plane of symmetry
through the plinth facing holder (3) and whereby the shaped adaptor recess (5) comprises

catch profilings (5.1) which, in the functioning position of the plinth facing holder (3)
when it is inserted into the shaped adaptor recess (5), engage the catch profilings (3.1) in

the plinth facing holder (3) in such a way that in the functioning position, the plinth facing

holder (3) is protected from being reset.
A fixing device according to claim 1, characterised in that the plinth facing holder
(3) comprises resiliently constructed catch arms (3.2) with the multi-stage catch profiling

(3.1).
A fixing device according to claim 1, characterised in that the catch arms (3.2) are
adapted to be braced on a main holder part via resilient struts (3.3).
A fixing device according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the catch profiling
(3.1, 5.1) is constructed with a multi-stage sawtooth catch profiling with sloping surfaces

orientated in the hold-down direction.
A fixing device according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in that the shaped
adaptor recess (5) is constructed as a stepped grooved recess for approximately the entire

disposition of the plinth facing holder (3) and in that the fixing projections (7) are adjacent
the catch profiling (5.1) within the shaped adaptor recess. 
A fixing device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the plinth
facing holder (3) comprises a depressor arm (3.5) which engages over the end edge of the

plinth facing.
A fixing device according to claim 6, characterised in that the depressor arm (3.5)
is provided with a shaped recess (3.7) for locating a tool.
A fixing device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that a furniture
foot support can be fixed on the adaptor piece (2).
A fixing device according to claim 8, characterised in that provided on the adaptor
piece (2) is a foot support recess (10) into which a furniture foot support (11) can be

inserted.
A fixing device according to claim 9, characterised in that the foot support (11)
is constructed to be length-variable.
A fixing device according to claim 10, characterised in that the foot support (11)
comprises on the under side a foot (12) which forms for a plinth facing an abutment

which, in plan view, is in line with the plinth facing holder (3) or an abutment area of the
adaptor piece (2).
A fixing device according to one of claims 8 to 11, characterised in that the
furniture foot support comprises a foot (12) with, on its top face, channel-like shaped

recesses (12.1) to accommodate a zero point locking projection (17).
A fixing device according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the
adaptor piece (2) is constructed as a decorative piece with fixing projections (7) disposed

towards the visible surface of the cabinet and, together with the furniture foot support
(11), it constitutes a decorative foot for the item of furniture. 
A fixing device according to claim 13, characterised in that the adaptor piece (2)
has a fixing side edge (2.1) constructed as a plane bearing surface and has decorative

surfaces (2.2) outside the fixing side edge (2.1).
A fixing device according to one of claims 1 to 14, characterised in that the
adaptor piece (2) comprises at least one shaped recess (25) for fixing a connector (26) by

frictional closure.
