<CLAIMS>
An articulated train comprising two or more carriage units 
provided with wheels, wherein arranged at least between two carriage 

units (2) is a wheel-less transport unit (5) which is respectively 
pivotally connected to the carriage units (2) which are adjacent on both 

sides thereof and is carried thereby, wherein the transport units (5) 
are respectively suspended at both sides to the carriage units (2) by 

way of a ball joint (17), characterised in that the ball joint (17) is 
arranged in the upper region of the transport and carriage units (2, 5) 

respectively. 
A train according to claim 1 characterised in that one or more 
transport units (5) are designed to transport goods. 
A train according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that 
the load-bearing structure of one or more transport units (5) comprises 

light metal, preferably aluminium, and/or plastics material, while the 

carriage units (2) are preferably constructed from steel. 
A train according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that 
one or more transport units (5) which are preferably provided with entry 

doors (4) are constructed in an aluminium integral construction combined 
with aluminium differential construction while the carriage units (2) 

are preferably constructed from steel. 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that 
the carriage bodies of one or more carriage units (2) are of a 

lightweight steel construction. 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that 
it has both a carriage unit (2) with a Diesel drive and also a carriage 

unit (2) with an electrical drive.  
 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that 
the carriage units (2) are each substantially in the form of autonomous 

car units which are coupled together by way of control lines. 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that 
at least one carriage unit (2) suitable for the connection of one or two 

double-deck transport units (5) has stairs (13, 14) leading into the 
upper and/or lower deck of the transport units. 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that 
the carriage units (2) have single-axle chassis which are radially 

adjustable in a track curve. 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in that 
the driver's cabin (11) is constructed using a composite plastics 

construction. 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in 
that the pivotal connection between the carriage unit (2) and the 

transport unit (5) is sprung (21) in the longitudinal direction and/or 
in the transverse direction of the train. 
A train according to claim 11 characterised in that there are 
provided preferably hydropneumatic control and/or damping devices (22) 

which are operative in the spring direction. 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised in 
that at least one preferably hydropneumatic support means (23) which is 

operative in the longitudinal direction of the train is arranged between 
a transport unit (5) and a carriage unit (2) in the lower connecting 

region of the transport and carriage units. 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 13 characterised in 
that disposed between the transport units (5) and the carriage units (2)  

 
laterally outside the vertical longitudinal central plane through the 

train are respective at least one damping members (28) which are 
preferably arranged symmetrically relative to the longitudinal central 

plane between a carriage and a transport unit (2, 5). 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 14 characterised in 
that at least one transport unit (5) is of a bridge-like configuration, 

wherein the upper closed region of the bridge is designed for 
transporting people and goods containers (8) can be fixed beneath said 

bridge. 
A train according to one of claims 1 to 15 characterised in 
that the transitional region between a carriage unit (2) and a transport 

unit (5) is closed off at the outside by a gas-filled concertina means 
(7) which is under a slightly increased pressure. 
A train according to claim 16 characterised in that the 
concertina means has folds. 
A train according to claim 16 or claim 17 characterised in 
that the mutually movable parts (2, 5) have an opening (30) which is 

enlarged on the inside and the inflated concertina means (7) extends 
into the enlarged region (30a) of the opening and is thereby held 

without further fixing means in the opening (30). 
A train according to one of claims 16 to 18 characterised in 
that the concertina means has a plurality of chambers which are at least 

partially filled with compressed air.
