A process for the preparation of 1,4-bis(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzene 
of the formula (I) 


 
which comprises rearranging diphenyl terephthalate 

of the formula (II) 

 
in 3 to 50 parts, relative to the diphenyl 

terephthalate, of an anhydrous organic solvent which 
is inert to the reactants, in the presence of 30 to 

500 mol-% of a haloalkanesulfonic acid (catalyst) of 

the general formula (III) or (IV)
Y(C
n
X
2n
)SO₃H   (III)
Y(C

F
2n
)SO₃H   (IV),

 
in which Y is a fluorine or hydrogen atom, and  

 
in which Y is a fluorine or hydrogen atom, and 

X is a fluorine and/or chlorine atom, with the 
proviso that at least one X is a fluorine atom, and 

n is an integer from 1 to 10, at temperatures of 10 
to 200°C. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
rearrangement is carried out at temperatures of 

about 50°C to about 160°C. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
rearrangement is carried out at temperatures of 

about 80°C to about 130°C. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 3, wherein Y in the general formulae (III) or 

(IV) is a hydrogen atom and this is in the β-position 
to the -SO₃H group. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 4, wherein the rearrangement is carried out in 

the presence of hexafluoropropanesulfonic acid or 
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 5, wherein the rearrangement is carried out in 

chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, chlorotoluene, 
nitrobenzene, N-methylpyrrolidone or sulfolane as 

inert organic solvent. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 6, wherein the rearrangement is carried out in 

about 5 to about 20 parts of the inert organic 
solvent, relative to the diphenyl terephthalate. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 7, wherein the rearrangement of the diphenyl 

terephthalate is carried out in the pressure range 
from atmospheric pressure up to the autogenous  

 
pressure of the reaction mixture under the reaction 

conditions used. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 8, wherein the rearrangement is carried out in 

the pressure range from atmospheric pressure up to 
about 15 bar. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 9, wherein the rearrangement is carried out in 

the absence of oxygen. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 10, wherein the mother liquor obtained after 

separating off the 1,4-bis(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzene 
is reused. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 11, wherein diphenyl terephthalate is added to 

the reaction mixture obtained after completion of 
the rearrangement after separating off the 1,4-bis(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzene 

and the mixture is 
reused. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 10, wherein the rearrangement is carried out in 

a one-pot process, starting from phenol and terephthaloyl 
dichloride, without intermediate isolation 

of the diphenyl terephthalate, the initial esterification 
being carried out at temperatures of about 10 

to about 200°C. 
The process as claimed in claim 13, wherein 
phenol/terephthaloyl dichloride is added to the reaction 

mixture obtained after completion of the rearrangement 
after separating off the 1,4-bis(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzene 

and the mixture is reused.
