<ABSTRACT>
A speaker enclosure includes a first chamber (5) and a second chamber (6) separated by a partition (4) having an opening 
to which a speaker (7) is fitted. The partition is made of a member capable of flexural vibration and/or is supported on the inner 

surface of the enclosure through a flexible member (10) and is equipped with through-holes (9) permitting the passage of air between 
the first and second chambers (5,6). When the speaker (7) is driven, the partition vibrates with the vibration of cone paper 

(8) of the speaker, and a sufficiently strong bass sound can be generated as if the diameter of the speaker were expanded, and 
clarity of the sound can be improved. Since the through-holes are formed in the partition thus vibrated, the vibration effect of the 

partition can further be improved, and a sound pressure generated by the vibration of the partition is further improved by the contraction 
effect of the through-holes. As a result, the sound felt by the body through the vibration of the outer wall of the container 

has sufficiently high clarity particularly in strong bass low sound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a body-acoustic device 
wherein acoustic signals in the form of electric output from such 
systems as an audio system, arcade amusement machine, or home 
video game system are converted into mechanical vibration to a 
human body. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
body-acoustic device wherein sound pressure from a loudspeaker 
causes the outer walls of the loudspeaker's housing to vibrate for 
transmission to a human body. In general, a body-acoustic device of the above type includes 
a housing wherein an inner space of the housing is divided into 
two parts by a diaphragm having an opening for mounting a 
loudspeaker. When the loudspeaker is operated, sound pressure 
from the loudspeaker vibrates the outer walls of the housing. An example of such a sonic body resonator is disclosed in the 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 2-266797. Particularly, 
Fig. 4 of this laid-open application discloses a loudspeaker 
housing comprising a pair of dish-shaped vibrating elements 
joined together to form a discoid. The inner space of this 
discoidal housing is divided, in its thickness direction, into 
two parts by a diaphragm made of a relatively hard material such  
 
as wood, and the diaphragm has an opening for mounting a 
loudspeaker. However, a problem with this type of body-acoustic device is 
that when the inner spaces of the housing are completely 
segregated from each other by the diaphragm, it becomes 
impossible to vibrate the entire outer wall of the housing, 
failing to produce satisfactory body-acoustic effect. The loudspeaker mounted to the diaphragm may be made to have 
a larger diameter and a larger output for increasing vibration 
propagated on the outside wall of the housing while also 
enhancing bass sound. However, this measure makes it necessary to 
increase the overall size of the housing for accommodating the 
diametrically larger loudspeaker, resulting in a weight increase 
of the body-acoustic device and a higher manufacturing cost. 
Thus, the body-acoustic device becomes unsuitable as a peripheral 
device for a low-cost video game system. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to 
provide a body-acoustic device wherein a diametrically small 
speaker having a small output can provide sufficient body 
vibration as well as sufficient propagation of bass sound. Another object of the present invention is to provide a small 
and light sonic body resonator which can be manufactured at a low 
cost but yet create sufficient
