A sensor for the measurement of mechanical variables of 
movement, in particular an angle-of-rotation sensor for 

slip-controlled automotive vehicle brake systems and/or for 
use in vehicle steering and suspension control systems, including 

a preferably rotatorily movable transmission unit 
for sensing the variable of movement and a stationary measuring 

device for generating an electric signal reproducing 
the travel of the transmission unit, the measuring device 

having a measuring element (1) which is fixed within a 
measuring element chamber (2) of a two-part housing (3), 

which is surrounded, at least in part, by a carrier housing 

(4) serving to attach the measuring device and for the accommodation 
of electric connections (5), 


characterized
 in that one housing half of the 
two-part housing (3) is constituted by a cup (6) and the 

other housing half of the two-part housing (3) is provided 
as a pressed-in cover (7) which extends down to the cup 

bottom, in that the cover (7) absorbs the injection-coating 
pressure of a carrier housing (4) formed of sealing material, 

whereby the ingress of sealing material into the measuring 
element chamber (2) is prevented, and in that the two 

housing halves and the incorporated measuring element (1) 
form a cartridge. 
A sensor as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that a magneto-resistive measuring 
element (1) is inserted into the measuring element 

chamber (2).  
 
A sensor as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that a semiconductor module, 
for example an IC module (8), is positioned within the measuring 

element chamber (2). 
A sensor as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that within the measuring 
element chamber (2) a Hall measuring element is positioned 

which is preferably connectible to the semiconductor module 
(8). 
A sensor as claimed in at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the carrier housing (4) 
is furnished with an annular groove in the area of the cup 

wall for the accommodation of a seal (9). 
A sensor as claimed in at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the measuring element (1) 
is embedded within the measuring element chamber (2) in a 

mass of plastic filling material, preferably in silicone 
material. 
A sensor as claimed in at least one of the preceding claims 
1 to 6,
characterized
 in that the carrier housing (4) 
being fixable to a wheel carrier of an automotive vehicle is 

shaped so as to form a protecting cap (10) which covers the 
rotor (11).  

 
A sensor as claimed in claim 7,
characterized
 in that the rotor (11) is configured 
as an impulse transmitter wheel which is integrated in 

the rotating wheel bearing housing (12) and is provided with 
permanent magnets (13). 
A process for the manufacture of a sensor, in particular an 
angle-of-rotation sensor for slip-controlled automotive vehicle 

brake systems and/or for use in vehicle steering and 
suspension control systems, including a preferably rotatorily 

movable transmission unit for sensing the variable of 
movement and a stationary measuring device for generating 

an electric signal reproducing the travel of the transmission 
unit, the measuring device having a measuring element 

(1) which is fixed within a measuring element chamber (2) of 
a two-part housing (3), which is surrounded, at least in 

part, by a carrier housing (4) serving to attach the measuring 
device and for the accommodation of electric connections 

(5), in particular as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
claims 1 to 8, 
characterized
 in that: 

a) the measuring element (1) and its IC module (8) are deposited 
in a thin-walled metal and non-ferromagnetic cup 

(6), preferably being deep-drawn from austenitic stainless 
steel, for example in a plastic material mass which has 

previously been or is subsequently injected into the cup 
(6), and in that they are closed by a relatively rigid cover 

(7) made of plastic material with an elevated melting point 
and reaching to the bottom of the cup, preferably of thermoset 

plastic, in such a manner that the electric connections 
(5) of the IC module (8) come to project through openings in  

 
the cover (7), the cover (7) during injection-moulding of a 

carrier housing (4) absorbing the injection-coating pressure 
and protecting the measuring element chamber (3) against the 

ingress of injection-moulding material, 
b) the cartridge which is composed of the cover (7), the cup 
(6), the measuring element (1) and the semiconductor (8) is 

injection-coated with plastic material to form the carrier 
housing (4) such that in the area of the cup wall an annular 

groove remains, into which a seal (9) is pressed in retroactively.
