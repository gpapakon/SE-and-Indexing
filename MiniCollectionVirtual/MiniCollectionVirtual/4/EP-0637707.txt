<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pinch valve with two clamps (2.1) which can be displaced parallel to one another by means of a drive (3.1) for the purpose of performing the pinching action. A transmission mechanism (3) is inserted between the drive and the clamps. In order to simplify the construction, reduce the danger of soiling and reduce maintenance and keep the closing force constant over the closing path, a scissors mechanism is provided as the transmission mechanism. To increase the life of the hose, it is furthermore provided with a particular cross-sectional contour in the region of the pinching plane.

<CLAIMS>
Pinch valve for closing off a flexible pipe (4); 

1.1 with a clamp and a counter-clamp (2.1; 2.1) 
to press together the flexible pipe; 
1.2 with a drive means (3.1); 
1.3 with a transmission mechanism (3) connected 
between the drive means (3.1) and clamps (2.1; 

2.1); 
1.4 wherein the transmission mechanism (3) comprises 
at least one slidable lattice grate with at least 

two double levers (3.3, 3.4); 
1.5 a double lever (3.4) of the slidable lattice 
grate is fixed to pivot at a point remote from 

the respective clamp (2.1); 
1.6 the drive means engages directly or indirectly 
another double lever (3.3) of the slidable 

lattice grate, 
 
characterised in that a slidable lattice grate is 

allocated to each clamp (2.1; 2.1). 
Pinch valve according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that a housing (1) is provided which encloses the 

transmission mechanism (3) as well as the clamps (2.1, 
2.1) with the section of pipe to be pressed together. 
Pinch valve according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the compression plane runs in the direction of 

movement of the drive means. 
Slidable lattice grate according to one of Claims 1-3, 
characterised in that the transmission mechanism is 

constructed symmetrically in relation to the 
compression plane.  

 
Pinch valve according to one of Claims 1-4,
 
characterised by the following features: 


5.1 the double lever ends lying closest to a clamp 
(2.1) of two double levers allocated to one 

another are pivoted on this clamp (2.1); 
5.2 one joint (3.8) is fixed in relation to this 
clamp (2.1), whilst the other joint (3.7) is able 

to slide on this clamp (2.1) perpendicular to the 
direction of compression. 
Pinch valve according to one of Claims 1-5,
 
characterised in that it has a flexible pipe with the 

following cross-sectional form: 

6.1 when pressed together, the flexible pipe has the 
form of an elongated rectangle except for its two 

end regions; 
6.2 the two end regions each have at least 
approximately the form of an ellipse, the small 

axis of the ellipse being at least slightly 
larger than the width of the rectangle; 
6.3 in the state of maximum flow cross-section, the 
outer contour of the flexible pipe (4) is 

thickened in relation to the circular contour by 
a single dome-like bulge lying in the compression 

plane, and the inside contour by two dome-like 
bulges, each lying directly in front of the 

compression plane.
