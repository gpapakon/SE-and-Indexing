<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel diguanamines,
which are useful as polymerizable monomers, as resin
raw materials for paint resins, adhesive resins, paper
coating resins, fiber treatment resins, powder coating
resins and building materials, as raw materials for
guanamine compound derivatives, as curing agents for
epoxy resins and urethane resins, and as modifiers for
high molecular substances such as rubber materials.
The present invention is also concerned with a preparation
process of the diguanamines, their derivatives
useful as curing agents and intermediates for various
resins, and also with use of the diguanamines and the
derivatives thereof.As resin raw materials for paint resins, adhesive
resins, paper coating resins, fiber treatment resins
and hide treatments, curing agents for various resins,
modifiers for rubber materials, modifiers for organic 
materials, and the like, guanamines containing an
aminotriazine group, such as melamine and benzoguanamine,
have heretofore been used widely for their
excellent properties including the high hardness and
gloss, colorless clearness, great chemical resistance
and waterproofness and excellent abrasion resistance
and electrical properties and, as curing agents, for
the superb pot life of the resulting resins.Further, a variety of research and development
work has been conducted on such melamines and
guanamines containing an aminotriazine group, resulting
in the provision of even polyfunctional guanamines
which contain a tetrafunctional group or a still higher
functional group and show excellent characteristic
properties from the viewpoint of the flexibility,
toughness, high hardness, waterproofness, curability
and the like of resins.Such polyfunctional guanamines are absolutely
different in structure from the novel diguanamines according
to the present invention, so that it is extremely
difficult to make a comparison therebetween.
For the sake of reference, however, examples which may
be given boldly include phthaloguanamine represented
by: 

and spiroguanamine represented by:
The former compound is, however, accompanied by
drawbacks such that resins obtained using it as a raw
material are very poor in ultraviolet light resistance
and weatherability and cannot hence be used at all as
resin raw materials for exterior paints, weatherproof
paints, automotive paints and building resins or are
subjected to a considerable limitation upon such applications
and that a substantial limitation is also
imposed on its use as a raw material for water-base
paint resins
