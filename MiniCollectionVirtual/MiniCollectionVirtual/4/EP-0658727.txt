at least one blade including an innermost vent (18) to 

define a passage for a flow of air. The innermost fin 
(18) is provided with open upper and lower ends to define 

therein an inner air flow passage. An air flow damper 
(22) is provided above or in the innermost fin (18) to

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vent 
structure for an air conditioner, and more precisely, 
relates to a vent structure able to prevent condensation. In a conventional air conditioning system, an 
air blowing outlet is provided in a wall or a ceiling of 
a room in a building, or other structure, to discharge 
air to thereby to carry out air-conditioning. In particular, multiple-flow type vents, in 
which air is radially discharged from the entire 
periphery thereof, have been widely used as vents 
attached to the ceiling of a room, etc. In general, the 
multiple-flow type vent (anemo type vent) is in the form 
of a hollow and substantially frusto-conical vent frame 
which is provided therein with a plurality of fins 
arranged concentrically with the vent frame. Figure 10 shows an example of a known vent 50 
which is attached to an opening 100 formed in the 
ceiling 101 and, through a neck 51, to a duct connecting 
port 53, so that the vent faces downward. The vent 50 is 
provided with a hollow and substantially truncated-cone-shaped 
vent frame (casing) 55 in which a plurality of 
concentric conical fins 57 are supported, so that air can 
be discharged in the radial direction from the outlet. However, the innermost (or central) conical 
fin 57a is provided with a closed top end. Consequently, 
there is no air flow within the innermost fin. 
Therefore, when the air-conditioning air is radially 
discharged from the air passages defined between the 
adjacent conical fins 57, the hot air in the room, drawn 
into the vicinity of the innermost fin 57a by the flow of  
 
cold air discharged from the vent 50 comes into contact 
with the cold air, resulting in the formation of 
condensation on the inner surface of the innermost 
fin 57a, due to the difference between the temperatures 
of the hot air and of the cold air. The condensation not 
only causes the vent to rust, but also deteriorates the 
appearance of the vent. To prevent this, it has been proposed to 
provide an innermost fin 57A having an open upper 
end 57B, as shown in Fig. 9 and as disclosed, for 
example, in Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication 
(Kokai) No. 5-52647. A plate 59 having a number of 
through holes 61 is provided in the innermost fin 57A. 
In this proposal, an air flow is caused within the 
innermost fin 57A to prevent the occurrence of 
condensation. Nevertheless, in the arrangement shown in 
Fig. 9, particularly on the downstream side of the 
plate 59, the air flow at the center of the flow through 
the innermost fin
