<ABSTRACT>
An integral structural element having improved sound and/or vibration dampening capacity and being composed of two support plates (1, 2) having therebetween spaced layers (3) of a viscoelastic material formed by a liquid synthetic elastomeric material having good adhesive properties and having a temperature resistance high enough to stand the temperature rise occuring due to the internal friction of the material while subjected to vibrations. The viscoelastic material between said two support plates (1, 2) is formed as strings of elastomeric material which are spaced from each other by a distance of 50-500 mm leaving an air space between the two support plates (1, 2) in the areas between adjacent strings of viscoelastic material (3). Each string (3) of dampening material has a material thickness of 1-5 mm, and a width of 10-50 mm. The structural element may, at the surface thereof to be mounted on a structural base, carry a mat of a natural or synthetic felt fibre material, having a product weight of 300-1200 g/m

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a building element, and the 
invention is more particularly concerned with a structural or a non-structural 
building element having improved sound damping and vibration damping 
properties and being of the known type formed as an integral building unit 
and composed by two superimposed plate like structural parts having 
therebetween spaced thin strings or strips of a viscoelastic material. By damping properties is meant, in the following, both sound 
damping properties and vibration damping properties, and the invention is 
intended to damp both low frequency, medium frequency and high 
frequency sound and vibration. In house building by means of modern 
building material like concrete, gypsum boards, light weight concrete 
blocks, different types of plastic materials, but also by means of timber, 
building board, chip board and other types of wooden material there are 
often problems in that sounds, vibrations etc. transmit from one apartment 
to another, both vertically and horizontally, not only by vibrations etc. in the 
material itself but also by air borne sounds and vibrations. Therefore the 
invention is concerned with a structural or non-structural building element 
for use as a sound and vibration damping building element in house 
building, like in floors, walls, ceilings etc. Sound and vibration transportation also causes the same type of 
problems in many types of apparatus like in telephone boxes, in loud 
speakers, in motor cars, in air planes, in ships, in motor hoods, in 
refrigerators etc. Thus, by building material is meant any type of material which can be 
used as floor structures, wall structures, ceiling structures etc. in ordinary 
house building, and also for the manufacture of any other types of objects 
where there is a wish to take advantage of the sound damping or the 
vibration damping properties of the building element according to the 
invention or of both the sound damping and the vibration damping 
properties thereof. A dampening structural element of the above mentioned type is 
known for instance from the British patent No 1,514,516 which element 
comprises two superimposed support elements like two metal plates, 
concrete slabs, plaster sheets or wooden fibre sheets having between said 
elements discontinuously extending strips or grids of a viscoelastic material 
presenting air spaces between said strips or grids.  
 In the manufacture of said known type of structural element there is 
used a sheet of viscoelastic

the materials including styrene rubber, nitrilic rubber, silicon rubber, 
chloroprenic rubber and acrylic rubber, all having good adhesive properties, 

and all having a temperature resistance or maximum service temperature of 
100Â°C or more in order to be able to stand the temperature rise occuring 

due to the internal friction of the material while subjected to vibrations, and
