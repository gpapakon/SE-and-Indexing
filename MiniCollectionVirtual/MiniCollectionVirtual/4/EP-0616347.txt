<ABSTRACT>
A single-pole or multipole circuit breaker has a housing which consists of a housing shell (1), of a closure shell (2) which can be fitted thereon and, in between, of a cavity (23) which acts as a pole chamber. The pole chamber contains a switching mechanism having at least one release lever (6), which is mounted such that it can pivot, for tripping the circuit breaker. The circuit breaker housing contains n identical housing intermediate shells (55), which can be inserted like a sandwich between the housing shell (1) and the closure shell (2). The housing intermediate shell (55) acts facing the housing shell (1) in the manner of a closure shell (2) and facing the closure shell (2) in the manner of a housing shell (1). Using n-1 housing intermediate shells (55), n pole chambers are formed, where 1 
<
/= n 
<
  INFINITY . The identical switching levers are coupled to one another in order jointly to trip all the poles by means of an integral coupling rod (47, 49) which passes through the switching levers in the row direction (3) of the housing intermediate shells (55) and whose length is matched to the number of poles and to the pole chamber width of the circuit breaker.
