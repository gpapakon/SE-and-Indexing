<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable container return device 10 for 
use with a lift arm 26 of a variable stroke lifter 

system 14 for lifting variable height containers 38, 
includes a vertically oriented rod 18 threadedly 

movable at its bottom end relative to the lift arm 26; 
a laterally extending member 42 operatively connected 

to the top end of the rod 18 for vertical movement 
therewith; a retention mechanism 44 operatively 

connected to the rod 18 for retaining the laterally 
extending member 42 in a selected radial direction so 

as to extend across an upper edge of an adjacent 
container 38; and an actuator mechanism 48-52 for 

rotating the rod 18 while permitting the rod 18 to 
slide longitudinally, and thereby threadedly raising 

and lowering the rod 18 relative to the lift arm 26, 
such that the laterally extending member 42 

accommodates different height containers 38.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging apparatus,
especially to variable stroke lifter systems,
particularly for lifting containers in bottom-up liquid
filling operations.For filling containers with liquids, it is
well-known to use a so-called "bottom-up" filler
technique in order to eliminate the build-up of foam.
In this technology, either the filler nozzle is lowered
into the container and then raised during the filling
operation, or the container is lifted around the filler
nozzle and then lowered during the filling operation,
with the two separating at a rate commensurate with the
flow rate of the liquid.When it is the container which is lifted and
then lowered, it is customary to employ a system
wherein either a vacuum cup or a suitable cross bar is
mounted on the end of a vertical actuator for engaging
the bottom surface of the container. A satisfactory
vacuum arrangement is shown and described in US-A-4,712,665.Various cam arrangements are also known for
lifting a container from a shelf or conveyor to
accommodate bottom-up filling thereof as the container
is lowered from around a filler nozzle, for example as
disclosed in US-A-1,993,367; US-A-2,100,359; US-A-2142257;
US-A-2,605,948; US-A-2,896,381; US-A-4,084,626;
US-A-4,388,795; and US-A-5,195,565.Of the above referenced patents, one, namely,
US-A-5,195,565 discloses means for changing the lift
height to accommodate different size containers; not
only the stroke of a vertical, container-lifting
member, but also the stroke of a vertical, container-lowering
or-return member can be adjusted.It is known that the stroke of a vertical,
container-return member may be manually changed by
making the member in two or more elongate parts and
then manually altering the overall length of the 
member, using a pull-pin, hair-pin, or wing nut.
However, with aseptic filling (within which is included
sterile filling for the purposes of the present
Specification), manual access by an operator to the
aseptic chamber of the packaging machine is required to
perform the adjustment and this then necessitates re-sterilization
of the chamber.US-A-956,286 discloses a beer bottle filling
machine in which bottles are advanced around a turret
including a ring of bottle rests upon which the bottles
stand. Each bottle rest is rigidly and centrally
mounted on the upper end of a depending stem, passing
freely through a hole in the outer end of a radial,
horizontal, bearing bar. The lower end portion of
each stem is adjustably secured in a first sleeve
rigidly connected to a second

Apparatus comprising a reciprocatory,
substantially vertically oriented, elongate member (18) for

driving a packaging element (38) in a substantially
vertical stroke, an oscillatory member (26) connected to

said elongate member (18) for reciprocating said
elongate member (18) longitudinally, and adjusting

means (18a, 18b, 27, 48-52) connected to said elongate
member (18) for adjusting said elongate member (18)

substantially vertically relative to said oscillatory
member (26), thereby to adjust said stroke, said

adjusting means (18a, etc.) comprising intermediate
means (18a, 27) intermediate said oscillatory member

(26) and said elongate member (18) and whereby rotation of
said elongate member (18) about a longitudinal axis

thereof relative to said oscillatory member (26) is
converted into linear longitudinal motion of said

elongate member (18) relative to said oscillatory
member (26), characterized in that said adjusting

means (18a, etc.) also comprises actuating means (48, 50)
adapted to rotate said elongate member (18) about said

longitudinal axis relative to said oscillatory member
(26) and to permit said elongate member (18) to move in a

direction of said longitudinal axis relative to said
actuating means (48, 50) while rotating.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
oscillatory member (26) comprises a lift arm (26).
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein a segment (18b) of said elongate member (18) is of

non-circular external cross-section and said
actuating means (48,50) comprises a unit (48) embracing

said segment (18b) and of non-circular internal
cross-section so as drivingly to engage said segment (18b).
Apparatus according to any preceding claim,
and further comprising gear means (52-60) for operating

said actuating means (48,50) , and a handle (62) for
