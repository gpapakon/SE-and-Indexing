<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a photoelectric conversion
method and apparatus thereof , and
more particularly to such photoelectric apparatus as
photoelectric switches for sensing the presence of objects
optically, displacement sensors for sensing distances to objects
by using optical reflection or for sensing displacements from
preset points, and photoelectric sensors applicable to the
displacement sensors or distance-determining type photoelectric
switches.Conventionally, direct reflection type photoelectric
switches have been used as photoelectric conversion apparatus.
They have been equipped with a light-irradiating section and a
light-receiving section on a common housing and have sensed the
light irradiated from the light-irradiating section and reflected
diffusively by the surface of objects to be sensed on the
light-receiving section.As the direct reflection type photoelectric switches can be
operated in the state of being equipped in only one sensor housing
and do not need such auxiliary parts as reflection plates, they
have such advantages as being easily attached, adjusted and
maintained, and cheap. Accordingly they have been used widely.However, the direct reflection type photoelectric switches 
may have following problems, since they utilize the light scattered on objects.That is:
(A) The sensible distance is shorter than with other systems.(B) The sensible distances vary widely depending on the surface reflectances of the
objects to be sensed.(C) In the case where the reflectance of a background is large, it is impossible to
sense small reflectance objects being in front of the background.GB-A-2211047 defining the closest prior art from which the invention proceeds
discloses a distance measuring device comprising a plurality of light-receiving
elements. For each light-receiving element, there are provided two operational
amplifiers, a capacitor and two comparators. Therefore, a large number of operational
amplifiers, capacitors and comparators are required, in particular if the number
of the light-receiving elements increases; this also applies to the number of outputs.
Furthermore, the conventional distance measuring device comprises a microcomputer
which recognizes a zone on a light-receiving sensor where an incident
light is inputted. So, the conventional distance measuring device can merely
determine a zone having a certain range; in other words, it can merely determine
a range of distances where an object exists, but cannot determine a distance itself.A further conventional
