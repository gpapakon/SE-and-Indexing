<ABSTRACT>
Machine enabling connections on boards carrying electronic circuits, especially hybrid circuits mounted on ceramic boards, to be continuously soldered. The machine consists of a bench provided with a conveyor (10) whose height can be manually adjusted by means of lifting devices (12), of a fluxing station (13) provided with an air jet, of a preheating station (14) heating the boards to a temperature of the order of 160@C, and of a soldering station (15) provided with a nozzle in which the boards move along at a constant speed in the vertical position.
