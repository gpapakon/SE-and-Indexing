<ABSTRACT>
Radio system comprising a transmitter means and several 
receiver units said transmitter means transmits on several 

radio channels information to said several receiver units 
with the particulars that said information is transmitted on 

each channel during consecutive transmission intervals and 
said several radio channels are synchronized to each other 

in regard to the switching between consecutive transmission 
intervals, said transmitter means comprises several 

transmitter stations, each of which being located at a 

different site and able to transmit information to at least 
one receiver station, the system comprises a central unit 

connected to each of said transmitter stations by individual 
synchronization lines for providing synchronization 

information to each of said transmitter stations, whereby 
said synchronization information is used by each transmitter 

station to synchronize its switching between consecutive 
transmission intervals to the switching of other transmitter 

stations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital cordless telephon system. Large office buildings are normally connected to the public 
telephone network (PSTN) through a plurality of lines which 
are provided through one or a plurality of so-called PBX 
(private branch exchange) or PABX (private automatic branch 
exchange) units for a multitude of users for the purpose of 
telephone communication. FIG. 1 shows such a PABX system in which a PABX unit 2 is 
connected via an interface 1 to the public telephone 
network (PSTN) and a plurality of telephones 3 are 
connected through corresponding lines 3a to the PABX unit. To give the users of such a PABX system the additional 
possibility of wireless communication, systems of this type 
are often equipped with cordless telephones (e.g. based on 
the European ETSI CAI or English (T2 standard), thereby enabling the user (or 
users) of such a PABX unit to communicate with the aid of a 
carried handset 4 with a stationary base station 5, such as 
a CT2 base station, through which infeed to the PABX unit 
then takes place. If the CT2 base station 5 is designed in such a way that it 
is simultaneously capable, as illustrated in FIG. 1, of 
communicating with a plurality of handsets 4 through use of 
a plurality of frequency channels, problems arise insofar  
 
as the individual channels may interfere with each other 
because of the same transmitting and receiving area. This 
may deteriorate the quality of a radio link or, in the 
worst case, break it off. It is customary with CT2 systems to make use of a so-called 
"ping-pong" transmission technique for communication 
between a handset and a CT2 base station. FIG. 2a is a time diagram illustrating this transmission 
technique. To avoid the provision of a respectively 
different channel frequency band for transmission from the 
base station to the handset and for transmission from the 
handset to the base station, a single frequency channel is 
used for the two transmission directions and divided in 
time in such a way that it is alternately employed for 
transmission and reception. Such a scheme is known as a TDD 
multiplexing. In FIG. 2a the intervals which are provided 
for transmission from the base station to a corresponding 
handset are designated by TX and the corresponding 
retransmission intervals by RX. Switching between these two 
transmission intervals can e.g. be carried out at a 
frequency of 500 Hz. FIG. 2b is another time diagram illustrating such a 
bidirectional transmission between the base station

<CLAIMS>
A digital cordless telephone system comprising 
several transmitter/receiver 
stations (7), each of which 
being located at a different site and able to 

transmit to and to receive from at least one handset (10) 
information via a radio channel, 


said information being transmitted and received on 
each channel during consecutive transmission 

intervals via a single band of frequencies achieving 
a bidirectional communication by use of a time 

compression multiplexing technique, 
said several radio channels are synchronized to each 
other in regard to the switching between said 

consecutive transmission intervals, 
said system further comprises a central unit (9) 
connected to each of said transmitter/receiver 

stations by individual synchronization lines for 
providing synchronization information to each of 

said transmitter/receiver stations (7), 
said synchronization information being used by each 
transmitter/receiver station to synchronize its 

switching between said consecutive transmission 
intervals to the switching of other transmitter/receiver 

stations. 
A digital cordless telephone system according to 
claim 1 in which also voice data and communication 

data is transmitted via said synchronization lines. 
A digital cordless telephone system according 
to Claim 1 or 2 in which said synchronization 

information is transmitted in a not continuously and 
not periodical manner. 
A digital cordless telephone system according to 
one of the preceding claims wherein the central unit (9) 

communicates with the transmitter/receiver stations 
in a TDMA-scheme, thereby allocating at least one 

time slot to each transmitter/receiver station. 
A digital cordless telephone system 
according to Claim 4 in which said central unit (9) 

communicates with the transmitter/receiver stations 
in a digital format, preferably a PCM-format. 
A digital cordless telephone system according 
to Claim 4 or 5 wherein each transmitter/receiver 

station receives, within one of its allocated time 
slots and via its synchronization line, a 

synchronization opportunity information to derive 
synchronization therefrom. 
A digital cordless telephone system according to 
Claim 6 wherein each transmitter station receives, 

in addition to the synchronization opportunity 
information, information on the phase difference 

between its own synchronization opportunity and the 
occurrence of the synchronization opportunity in at 

least one further transmitter/receiver station.  
 
A digital cordless telephone system according to 
Claim 7 in which said phase information comprises 

information on the phase difference to a reference 
synchronization signal. 
A digital cordless telephone system according to 
Claim 7 or 8 wherein said phase information is used 

in each transmitter/receiver station to preload 
after receipt of a respective synchronization 

opportunity information, a clock counter in that 
synchronization between all transmitter stations is 

achieved when each clock counter reaches a 
predetermined value. 
A digital cordless telephone system according 
to Claim 9 wherein the counters are additionally 

preloaded by constants representing offset 
variations due to different transmission times 

between the central unit and the individual 
transmitter/receiver stations (7). 
A digital cordless telephone system according to 
one of the preceding claims wherein said system is 

configured to replace a conventional PABX-system.
