<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hollow body made of a fluororesin, especially PTFE obtained by pasty extrusion, having a degree of anisotropy less than 1, and preferably substantially equal to 0.5. In order to manufacture such hollow bodies, a powder of fluororesin, especially a powder of as-produced PTFE, is mixed with a lubricant; the mixture is compressed in order to obtain an isotropic compact tubular preform; the said preform is introduced into an extruding press; the preform is pushed back through a passage (18) of reduced cross-section in a die (4, 5) so as to form longitudinally oriented fibres; the said fibres are compressed on leaving the said passage (18) in an internal expansion chamber (21) having an enlarged cross-section, so as to orient the said fibres transversely; and the fibres are delivered through the exit orifice (15a) in the die (4, 15) in order to obtain a hollow body.

A hollow body made of a resin containing fluorine, in particular 
of PTFE, obtained by extrusion of a paste, characterized 

in that it has an anisotropy rate that is substantially lower 
than 1 and preferably substantially equal to 0.5. 
An extrusion method for the manufacture of hollow bodies 
made of a resin containing fluorine in accordance with claim 1, 

according to which a resin containing fluorine, in particular 
raw PTFE, is mixed with a lubricating agent, the mixture is compressed 

to obtain a compact isotropic tubular preform, the said 
preform is introduced into an extrusion press, and the preform 

is pushed back through a duct with a reduced cross-section of a 
die so as to form longitudinally orientated fibres, characterized 

in that at the outlet of the said duct (18), the said 
fibres are compressed in an internal expansion chamber (21) with 

an enlarged cross-section so as to orientate the said fibres 
transversely, that after passing into the internal expansion 

chamber, the fibres are caused to pass through a second duct 
(23) with a reduced cross-section, so as to reorientate them 

partly in the longitudinal direction; the fibres are again compressed 
in an expansion zone (25) with an enlarged cross-section 

so as to preserve in the main the transverse orientation of the 
fibres, and that the fibres are delivered through the outlet 

opening (15
a
) of the die (4, 15) to obtain a hollow body. 
An extrusion method according to claim 2, characterized in 
that for the die (4, 15), an overall reduction ratio Rg is used 

in a range comprised between 2 and 20. 
An extrusion press for operating the method according to 
claim 2, the said press comprising a die that has at one end a 

preferably substantially conical recess for receiving a tubular 
preform which leads into a duct with a reduced cross-section, 

and a central, substantially cylindrical element forming the 
core of the die and passing through the said receiving recess 

and the said first duct, characterized in that the duct (18) 
leads into an internal expansion chamber (21) with an enlarged 

cross-section, that the said internal chamber (21) is joined 
through a second duct (23) with a reduced cross-section to a 

preferably substantially conical outlet recess (22) arranged on 
the opposite side to the die (4, 15), and that the said central 

element (5) is joined to a preferably substantially conical part 
(24) that is capable of being accommodated in the outlet recess 

(22) so as to define an expansion zone (25) with an enlarged 
cross-section at the outlet of the said second duct (23). 
An extrusion press according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the die is constituted by two separate parts (4, 15) which 

come to be fitted in one another, the first part (4) comprising 
the recess (17) for receiving the preforms and the duct (18),  

 
the second part (15) comprising the second duct (23) and the 

outlet recess (22), a preferably frustoconical cutout (19, 20) 
being arranged in each of the ends opposite the said parts (14, 

15) so as to form the said internal expansion chamber (21) when 
the parts (4, 15) are fitted together. 
An extrusion press according to claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the inclination of the generator (24a) of the conical 

parts (24) relative to its axis is slightly greater than that of 
the outlet recess (22) so as to reduce the cross-section of the 

expansion zone (25) in the vicinity of the outlet opening (15
a
) 
of the die.
