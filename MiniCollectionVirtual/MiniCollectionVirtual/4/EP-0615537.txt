<ABSTRACT>
A unified, composite tape structure is provided. The tape comprises two outer pressure-sensitive adhesive layers (16, 18) joined via melt processing. A method of making the tape comprising the use of melt processing is also disclosed. In the method a plurality of layers are melt processed and simultaneously joined to form the unified composite (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite
pressure-sensitive adhesive tape and to a solventless
method for making these tapes.Composite pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes
are known. Typically they comprise at least one
adhesive layer adhered to another layer. This other
layer may comprise a second layer of adhesive or a
backing layer which may itself comprise several layers
of material.Techniques for the manufacture of composite
pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes are also known. One
technique comprises a multistep solvent coating
process. Another comprises a multistep hot melt
coating process. In each of these techniques the
individual layers that make up the composite tape are
applied sequentially. Consequently, they are time
consuming and labor intensive. Solvent coating
processes further necessitate the use of special
handling and equipment so as to minimize hazards to
workers and the environment. Both processes subject
the tape to severe operating conditions (for example
elevated temperature, solvent atmosphere, etc.). This
necessitates the use of non-extensible, tear-resistant,
heat-resistant and/or water resistant backing materials
so as to withstand the rigors of the manufacturing
process. However, this also limits the use of
polymeric materials as the backing material to those
that are oriented and/or are sufficiently thick to
withstand the rigors of the manufacturing process. An attempt to reduce the number of steps in
the process involves the use of coextrusion. Such
techniques are described in a number of publications.
For example, US-A-3,415,920 discloses the
manufacture of a polyolefin encapsulated adhesive fiber
by the coextrusion of an adhesive and an outer skin of
polyolefin.Japanese patent publication JP-46-21120
discloses a process for the melt extrusion of a stream
of thermoplastic synthetic resin and a stream of an
adhesive, guiding the two streams of resin through a
single die to form a single fluid flow having separate
layers made up of each stream, and forming a tape
having adhesive on one side.US-A-3,823,211 discloses a method of
coextruding an adhesive/backing construction in the
form of a tubular film and a method of forming a bubble
of the backing material followed by coating an adhesive
on the inside surface of the bubble of the backing
material. Both techniques result in tape having
adhesive on one side.US-A-4,214,261 discloses a multilayer
polypropylene film which can be prepared by coextrusion.
It further discloses that an adhesive can
be subsequently coated onto the
