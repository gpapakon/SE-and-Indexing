<ABSTRACT>
A closing unit (11) for form tools (6) of injection moulding machines has a stationary mould-supporting or base plate (2), a mould supporting plate (3) movable with respect thereto so as to provide adjustment of their mutual distance and a drive supporting plate (4) linked to the stationary supporting or base plate (2) by traction members (5), for example tie-pieces. The traction members (5) may also be used as sliding guides for the movable mould supporting plate (3) and an electric motor (18), which alternately moves one or several knee lever systems (7) by means of a threaded spindle (15) between a bent position and a stretched position, and acts as an actuator for the movable mould clamping plate (3). The knee lever system(s) are mounted between the drive supporting plate (4) and the movable mould clamping plate (3) and in the stretched position of the knee lever system(s) (7) the form tool (6) is held under closure tension between both mould supporting plates (2 and 3). The essential aspect of the closing unit (1) is that a liquid-cooled (19) servomotor (18), in particular an AC synchronous motor or a three-phase synchronous motor is used as the electric  motor, having a hollow shaft (17) within which the threaded spindle (15) is axially movable by means of a nut (16) and non-rotatively engages the knee lever system(s) (7).

Closing unit (1) for mould tools (6) of injection moulding machines 

with a stationary mould carrier or base plate (2), 
a mould carrier plate (3) adjustable in spacing relative thereto by 
displacement 
as well as a drive carrier plate (4), 
which is connected with the stationary mould carrier plate or base 
plate (2) by tension members (5), for example posts, 
which are usable at the same time as displacement guide for the movable 
mould carrier plate (3), 
wherein an electric motor (18) serves as setting drive for the movable 
mould carrier plate (3), 
which by way of a threaded spindle (15) changes over one or more 
toggle lever systems (7) alternatingly between a folded position and 

an extended position, 
which toggle lever system or systems is or are incorporated between 
the drive carrier plate (4) and the movable mould carrier plate (3), 
and wherein in the extended position of the toggle lever system or 
systems (7) the mould tool (6) is held between the two mould carrier 

plates (2 and 3) under closing tension, 
 
characterised thereby 


that a liquid-cooled (19) servomotor (18) - especially an AC 
synchronous motor or a direct current synchronous motor - is provided 

as electric motor, 
which comprises a hollow shaft (17), 
within the threaded spindle (15) is axially displaceable by way of a 
nut (16), 
which engages in rotationally fast manner at the toggle lever sytem or 
systems (7). 
Closing unit according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the nut 
(16) associated with the threaded spindle (15) is coupled with the hollow 

shaft (17) of the servomotor (18) within the drive carrier plate (4).  
 
Closing unit according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised 
thereby that the threaded spindle (15) is connected in rotationally fast 

manner with a crosshead (14) engaging at the toggle lever system or 
systems (7). 
Closing unit according to one of claims 1 to 3 with a device, which 
is associated with the two mould carrier plates, for adjustment of tool 

installation height, characterised thereby that provided as drive of the 
device (21) for adjustment of tool installation height is an electric 

motor (22), which is seated at the drive carrier plate (4) and drives a 
gearwheel (26) which is similarly mounted at this and which in turn 

meshes with pinions (30), wherein each pinion (30) is coupled with a 
respective nut (31), which is mounted at the drive carrier plate (4) to 

be axially displaceable but rotatable and which stands in engagement with 
a thread of a respective tension element (5) provided between the 

stationary mould carrier plate or base plate (2) and the drive carrier 
plate (4). 
Closing unit according to claim 4, characterised thereby that the 
electric motor (22) is provided with a gearwheel transmission (23) as 

well as equipped with a blocking brake (24). 
Closing unit according to one of claims 4 and 5, characterised 
thereby that the gearwheel (26) is formed by a ring (27), which is 

mounted, by track rollers or guide rollers (28) engaging at its inner 
circumference, at the drive carrier plate (4).
