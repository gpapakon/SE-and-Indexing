<ABSTRACT>
Adhesive compositions containing a hydroxy-functionalized 
radial, three-arm copolymer the arms of 

which contain styrene-isoprene blocks, in which the 
average molecular weight of the polystyrene blocks is 

lower than 30,000 and is generally comprised within 
the range of from 7,000 to 30,000, and the average 

total molecular weight of said block polymers is 
comprised within the range of from 120,000 to 250,000. 
Such a functionalized radial copolymer makes it 
possible, according to the monomeric composition 

adopted and by suitably blending with tackifier resins 
and plasticizer oils, adhesive compositions to be 

obtained which can be of "hot melt" type or of solvent 
borne type, displaying good adhesive and cohesive 

properties and such as to secure an optimal balance 
between these properties and their processing ability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to functionalized 
radial block copolymers containing styrene-isoprene 
blocks. In particular, the present invention relates 
to functionalized, radial, styrene-isoprene block 
copolymers useable in adhesive compositions 
additionally containing a suitable resin for improving 
the adhesive properties, and a plasticizer oil. The 
present invention relates furthermore to said 
compositions and to manufactured articles produced by 
using them. From the prior art, adhesive compositions are 
known which are based on linear or radial polystyrene-polyisoprene 
or polystyrene-polybutadiene block 
copolymers, corresponding to the general formulae: 
ABA when linear and (AB)nBA when radial,  
wherein n is a numeral higher than, or equal to, 2, 
and is generally comprised within the range of from 2 
to 4, A is a polystyrene block and B is a polydiene 
(either polyisoprene or polybutadiene) block. Polymeric compositions containing, besides block 
copolymers, suitable resins for improving the adhesive 
properties (commonly known as "tackifier" resins) and 
plasticizer oils, have been recently described; they 
constitute a valuable alternative to the old adhesive 
compositions, which contained rubbery materials, above 
all based on natural rubber, and which proved to be 
inadequate for most advanced uses; so, e.g., in the 
field of pressure sensitive adhesives, and whenever  
 
low viscosity values of the hot-melt adhesive are 
required together with high technological performances 
and high adhesive power, the block copolymer-based 
adhesive compositions as said above, proved to be more 
effective. From patent literature known from the prior art 
which disclose adhesive compositions based on linear 
block copolymers of ABA character, may we remind here 
patent application WO 91/02039, and U.S. patent Nos. 
3,239,478; 3,784,587; 3,427,269. From those patent 
documents known from the prior art, which disclose 
adhesive compositions based on radial block copolymers 
of (AB)nBA character, we wish to remind here U.S. No. 
4,096,203. Hot-melt adhesive compositions based on styrene-isoprene 
block copolymers are particularly used 
whenever characteristics of adhesion to poorly polar 
substrates such as polyethylene, polypropylene and the 
like, are required, and in those applications in which 
the product is submitted to stresses of mechanical 
and/or elastic character. This is the case of diapers 
and/or sanitary towels; for such applications, block 
copolymer-based hot-melt adhesives,
