<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of contacts for rotary switches are 
concentrically formed on a printed circuit board (24) 

accommodated in a case (15). A fixed cylinder (29) is disposed 
opposite to the concentric arrangement of the contacts. 

A rotary shaft (26) of a first rotary knob (21) pierces through and 
supports the fixed cylinder so as to drive slidable 

contact pieces for a first rotary switch. A rotary 
cylinder (33) which functions as a rotary shaft of a second 

rotary knob (22) is fitted to the outer periphery of the fixed 
cylinder so as to drive slidable contact pieces for a 

second rotary switch. Spring coils (31) for the first and 
second rotary knobs are mounted on the fixed cylinder. 

The spring coils (31) provide the first (21) and second rotary 
knobs (22) with tensions for their rotation reference 

positions. Thus, the positions of slidable contact 
pieces of the rotary switches are elastically maintained 

to their reference angle positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiple 
staged rotary switch for use in various controllers as in 
automobiles. When the driver of a car controls a variety of 
apparatuses (such as an audio apparatus and an air 
conditioner) of the car, he or she should fumble for and 
operate switches thereof without changing his or her eyes 
from the front. If the switches were of push button 
type, the driver could not easily fumble for them. In 
addition, while the driver is fumbling for a switch, he 
or she may sometimes press incorrect switches. On the other hand, when a multiple staged rotary 
switch is used, the driver can easily fumble for and 
correctly control it. Moreover, when the multiple staged 
rotary switch is used, it can be prevented from 
incorrectly being operated. In other words, unless the 
driver rotates the switch, it is never operated. Thus, 
in the multiple staged rotary switch, the possibility of 
unintended operations can be reduced. Therefore, the 
multiple staged rotary switches are being increasingly 
used. Fig. 1 shows the construction of a conventional 
multiple staged rotary switch. In this switch, rotary 
switches 1, 2, and 3 are multiply staged. The rotary 
switches 1, 2, and 3 have drive shafts 4, 5, and 6, 
respectively. The drive shafts 4, 5, and 6 are 
concentrically formed. The more inner shafts the more 
they extrude in the axial direction thereof. Knobs 7, 8, 
and 9 are mounted on end portions of the drive shafts 4, 
5, and 6, respectively. With the knobs 7, 8, and 9, the  
 
rotary switches 1, 2, and 3 are operated, respectively. Electric contact signals of the rotary switches 
1, 2, and 3 are extracted from wiring boards 11, 12, and 
13, respectively. The wiring boards 11, 12, and 13 are 
electrically connected to a main wiring board 14. The 
main wiring board 14 and the rotary switches 1, 2, and 3 
are accommodated in a case 15. A lead cable 16 connected 
to the main wiring board 14 is connected to apparatuses 
to be controlled. Thus, the case 15 can be disposed at 
any position in the automobile corresponding the length 
of the lead cable 16. For example, the case 15 may be 
disposed at a position that the driver can reach it with 
his or her hand. As shown in Fig. 1, since the conventional 
multiple staged rotary switch is constructed of the 
rotary switches 1, 2, and 3 which are staged, the 
thickness H of the case 15 becomes large. In this 
multiple staged rotary switch, when the driver turns the 
knob 7, 8, or 9 clockwise or counterclockwise and then 
releases it,

A multiple staged rotary switch, comprising: 

a plurality of sets of switch contacts 
concentrically disposed on a printed circuit board (24); 
a case (15) for accommodating and supporting said 
printed circuit board and defining an opening opposite to 

the center of said switch contacts; 
a fixed cylinder (29) defining an axial through-hole 
and extending from said case through said opening; 
a rotary shaft (26) piercing through the through-hole 
of said fixed cylinder (29) and having a first rotary knob (21) 

disposed at one end thereof outside said case (15); 
a first slidable contact support means (37) disposed 
at an inner end of said case of said rotary shaft and 

adapted to support slidable contact means, said slidable 
contact means being adapted to be in and out of

reference position; and  
 
second spring coil means disposed between said 
fixed cylinder and said second rotary knob (22) and adapted to 

apply a tension to said second rotary knob (22) so as to 
return said second rotary knob to a predetermined 

rotation reference position.

inside said case; 
slidable contact means disposed on said third 
slidable contact support means (39) and adapted to be in and 

out of electrical contact with a third set of said switch 
contacts so as to form a third rotary switch; and 
third spring coil means (31) disposed between said 
case (15) and said third rotary knob and adapted to apply a 

tension to said third rotary knob so as to return said 
third rotary knob to a predetermined rotation reference 

position.
