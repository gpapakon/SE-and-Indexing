<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transport crate made of plastic and consisting of a bottom and four side walls which are connected at their upper edge by a frame, the two longitudinal side walls arranged opposite one another being foldable in their middle parallel to the bottom, being attached by their lower edge to the bottom by means of hinges and being attached by their upper edge to the frame by means of hinges. The object of the invention is to provide a crate which can be produced primarily from plastic and allows orderly lateral removal of the articles when the transport crate is in a stack. The invention consists in that the bottom is designed as a trough whose walls take up part of the height of the upright crate, and in that at least one end-face wall is designed as a flap which can be pivoted about a hinge located at its lower edge, which, with its side edges and/or with projections arranged on its side facing the interior of the crate, engages behind and thus stabilises the foldable longitudinal side wall parts in their upright position, and which has attachment means for its releasable attachment to the frame or is connected to such means.
