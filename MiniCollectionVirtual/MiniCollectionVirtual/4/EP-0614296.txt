<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an ATM local area network with a plurality of stations (10) which are in each case switched via a network interface (9) containing at least one switching device (11), with transmission and reception loop connections (16, 19), and which are provided for the transmission of cells. The switching device (11) is provided for the forwarding of a user cell containing user-related information from a reception loop connection (16) to the transmission loop connection (19) and/or to the station (10) or from a station (10) to the transmission loop connection (19), depending on status information. Furthermore, the switching device serves to forward a control cell, which serves at least to record switching functions, from a reception loop connection (16) to the transmission loop connection (19) and/or to a control arrangement (24) controlling the switching device (11) and/or to the station (10) or from the control arrangement (24) to the transmission loop connection (19) and/or to the station (10) or from the station (10) to the transmission loop connection (19) and/or to the control arrangement (24).

<CLAIMS>
A local-area, ring-formed network operating in the asynchronous transfer
mode (ATM), comprising a plurality of stations (10) which are each coupled to transmitting

and receiving ring lines (16, 19) 
via
 a network interface (9) which comprises at least one
switch (11) and which stations are provided for transmitting cells, 
characterized

in that
 the network interface (9) comprises a status register (25) which is provided for
storing the status of the associated station (10) and of the switch (11) as status information,

and comprises a controller (24) controlling the switch (11),
in that
 the switch (11) is coupled to the status register (25) and to the controller (24),

and 
in that
 the switch (11) in response to status information is arranged for transferring a

user cell containing user-related information

from the receiving ring line (16) to the transmitting ring line (19) and/or to the
station (10), or
from the station (10) to the transmitting ring line (19),

for transferring a control cell used at least for storing switching functions

from the receiving ring line (16) to the transmitting ring line (19) and/or to the
controller (24) and/or to the station (10), or
from the controller (24) to the transmitting ring line (19) and/or to the station (10),
or
from station (10) to station (10) and/or to the transmitting ring line (19) and/or to
the controller (24).
A local area network as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
controller (24) is provided for extracting the status of the station (10) and of the switch (11)

from the status register (25).
A local area network as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 each
network interface (9)


is arranged for deriving a receiving clock signal which is assigned to the incoming
cell stream over the receiving ring line (16), and 
is arranged for generating a transmitting clock signal decoupled from the received
clock signal, which transmitting clock signal is assigned to the outgoing cell stream

over the transmitting ring line (19).
A local area network as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 each
network interface (9) comprises


a buffer memory (12) between receiving ring line (16) and switch (11) for
matching the cell stream with an internal clock signal, and
a buffer memory (13) between transmitting ring line (19) and switch (11) for
matching the cell stream with the transmitting clock signal.
A local area network as claimed in Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

between each network interface (9) and the associated station (10) buffer memories (14, 15)
are provided for matching the cell stream produced by the network interface (9) or to be

received thereby at least with a station clock signal.
A local area network as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
that
 each network interface (11) is provided for transmitting and receiving cells with
different priorities.
A local area network as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in
that
 each network interface (9) or each station (10) is provided for inserting an entry about
the service, the address and the type of cell into the header field of a cell to be transmitted.
A local area network as claimed in Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the bits
reserved for the VCI (Virtual Channel Identifier) in the header field of the cell contain

information about the service and the bits reserved for the VPI (Virtual Path Identifier)
contain the information about the address.
A local area network as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in
that
 a transmitter station, in the event of a request for a link to at least one receiver station,
is first provided for generating at least one control cell containing an inquiry about the

status of the receiver station, 
in that
 at least the receiver station, once it has received the 
inquiry, is arranged for sending out at least one control cell containing the information

about its status, and 
in that
 the transmitter station, once it has received the status
information, is provided for forming at least one control cell for a connection set-up if the

status of at least one receiver station makes a link possible.
A local area network as claimed in Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the
transmitter or a receiver station is provided for generating at least one control cell which

contains a message about the connection set-up.
A local area network as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized
in that
 a respective station is arranged for only monitoring the connection set-up in the
transmitting or in the receiving direction.
A network interface (9) for a local area, ring-formed network operating in
