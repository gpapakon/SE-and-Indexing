Process and apparatus for the heat treatment of liquid 
food products, particularly for heating milk in the making 

of dairy products. The process consists in immersing a heat 
exchanger in the liquid to be treated, which is contained 

in a vessel, and in moving the liquid to be treated over 
the heat-exchange surface of the heat exchanger.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and an 
apparatus for the heat treatment of liquid food products, 
particularly for heating milk in the making of dairy 
products. In the dairy-product industry, the conversion of the 
initial product, constituted by milk, generally entails 
heat treatment with heating operations that for some 
particular processes must occur in very short times. A typical example of this requirement is the process 
for producing cheese made from heated curd, such as for 
example the cheese known as "Grana Padano" or the one known 
as "Parmigiano-Reggiano", in which the milk is coagulated 
by means of heat-exchange coagulation devices. These 
devices are constituted by a conical copper vessel provided 
with a jacket in which high-temperature steam is 
circulated. With these coagulation devices it is possible 
to perform an effective heat exchange which ensures that 
the milk passes from a temperature of approximately 34oC to 
approximately 56oC, i.e. with a temperature increase of 
22oC, within 8 to 9 minutes, which is the so-called 
"cooking time" for producing the above mentioned cheese 
types. Conventional conical coagulation vessels have a 
capacity of approximately 1200 liters with a heat-exchange 
surface of approximately 4.5 square meters. This is, in 
practice, the maximum size for an exchanger of this type, 
since any further increase would cause an excessive  
 
increase in the volume of the liquid to be treated with 
respect to the heat-exchange surface and would thus slow 
down the heating of the milk, making it impossible to 
comply with the "cooking time" required for the typical 
production of these cheeses. This fact is a very severe limitation to production 
and significantly affects the production costs of these 
kinds of cheese. Other dairy processes also require milk heating, which 
is in any case performed in vessels having walls with a 
jacket in which the heating fluid circulates, with the 
above described limitations in quantity and/or speed. A principal aim of the present invention is to solve 
the problems described above by providing a process and 
apparatus for the heat treatment of liquid food products, 
particularly for heating milk in the making of dairy 
products, which allows to treat, within the required time, 
considerably larger masses of liquid food product than 
those that can be treated with currently commercially 
available processes and equipment. An object of the invention is to provide a process and 
an apparatus which are highly
