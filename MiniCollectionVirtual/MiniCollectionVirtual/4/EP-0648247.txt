<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to oil compositions, 
primarily to fuel oil compositions, and more especially 
to fuel oil compositions susceptible to wax formation at 
low temperatures, and to additive compositions for such 
fuel oil compositions. Heating oils and other distillate petroleum fuels, 
for example, diesel fuels, contain alkanes that at low 
temperature tend to precipitate as large crystals of wax 
in such a way as to form a gel structure which causes 
the fuel to lose its ability to flow. The lowest 
temperature at which the fuel will still flow is known as 
the pour point. As the temperature of the fuel falls and approaches 
the pour point, difficulties arise in transporting the 
fuel through lines and pumps. Further, the wax crystals 
tend to plug fuel lines, screens, and filters at temperatures 
above the pour point. These problems are well 
recognized in the art, and various additives have been 
proposed, many of which are in commercial use, for 
depressing the pour point of fuel oils. Similarly, 
other additives have been proposed and are in commercial 
use for reducing the size and changing the shape of the 
wax crystals that do form. Smaller size crystals are 
desirable since they are less likely to clog a filter; 
certain additives inhibit the wax from crystallizing as  
 
platelets and cause it to adopt an acicular habit, the 
resulting needles being more likely to pass through a 
filter than are platelets. The additives may also have 
the effect of retaining in suspension in the fuel the 
crystals that have formed, the resulting reduced settling 
also assisting in prevention of blockages. Effective wax crystal modification (as measured by 
CFPP and other operability tests, as well as simulated 
and field performance) may be achieved by ethylene-vinyl 
acetate or propionate copolymer (EVAC or EVPC)-based flow 
improvers. In EP-A-45342 is described a cold flow additive, 
based on an EVAC modified by esterification with 
2-ethylhexanoic, acrylic, and phthalic acids. In "Wissenschaft und Technik" 42(6), 238 (1989), M. 
Ratsch & M. Gebauer describe cold flow additives 
including an EVAC esterified with, interalia, n-hexanoic 
acid. In U.S. Patent No. 3 961 916, middle distillate flow 
improvers are described which comprise a wax growth 
arrestor and a nucleating agent, the former being 
preferably a lower molecular weight ethylene-vinyl ester 
copolymer with a higher ester content, the latter 
preferably a higher molecular weight copolymer with a 
lower ester content, the esters preferably,
