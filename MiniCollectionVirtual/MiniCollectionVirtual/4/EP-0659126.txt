<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a quick connector preferably for use in connecting a fuel filler neck (24) to a fuel tank. The connector includes a housing (12) having a first end (15) which receives a tube (24) or nipple having an upset portion (26) which is preferably mounted to the fuel tank. The connector includes a sliding collar (14) with expandable fingers (42), a compression ring (16) mounted about the collar (14) and retaining fork (18) for retaining the collar (14) and ring (16) within the housing (12). The upset can be inserted past the expandable fingers (42) with little force. When the tube (24) is attempted to be withdrawn, the compression ring (16) compresses the fingers about the tube (24) restricting release requiring exceedingly larger forces to remove the tube (24). The opposite end of the connector of the disclosed embodiment includes a quick connect for connecting a hose (28) to the housing (12). This connector includes a compression sleeve (68) which is mounted about the hose (28) and compressed by a locking means (90, 92) which locks to the housing (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to quick connectors
for interconnecting a fuel filler line.Low cost quick connectors for connecting tubing have
been widely used in the automotive industry as well as other
non-automotive industries. Typically, they are used to connect
fluid lines that have small diameters and low pull-off
requirements.One example of such a quick connector is known as an
interference type connector. This type of connector has
expandable fingers mounted in a housing that create a mechanical
interference on an upset portion or bead formed on the tube to
be connected. The tube and upset are inserted into the
connector housing past the expandable fingers. The fingers
expand to allow the upset to pass and then retract behind the
upset retaining the tube in the housing. The retention or pull
off force, i.e. the force required to pull the tube out of the
housing, is dependent upon the rigidity of the expandable
fingers. Stated another way, the retention force of an
interference type connector is determined in large part by the
resistance to expansion of the fingers. If the fingers expand
easily to allow easy insertion of the tube upset, the pull off
or retention force will be low. To get higher retention forces,
the fingers have to be more rigid, making insertion of the upset
more difficult. Additionally, fingers that are more rigid are 
more difficult to manually expand to remove the tube when
removal is desired.There are many applications which require very high
pull-off forces, but low insertion forces. One such application
is the connection of the fuel filler neck to the fuel tank of a
vehicle. Pull-off forces in excess of 500 pounds are required.
Correspondingly, low insertion forces of only about 20 pounds
are required. Because of the need for high pull-off forces and
low insertion forces, typical quick connectors are unacceptable
for connecting fuel filler necks to fuel tanks. They are also
unacceptable in other applications requiring high pull-off
forces and low insertion forces.The present invention overcomes the above problems
by providing a connector which has high pull-off forces, in
excess of 500 pounds, while having low insertion forces, of
below 20 pounds. The quick connector of the present invention
has a housing with a locking assembly that receives a fuel line
having an upset portion. The locking assembly is capable of
providing variable forces with respect to the fuel line with the
force being weak upon insertion of the fuel line so that there
are low insertion forces and
