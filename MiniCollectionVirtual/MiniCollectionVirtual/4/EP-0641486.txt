<ABSTRACT>
Certain components of an integrated circuit package are disclosed herein including one or more dies (16), each of which has an array of die output/input bond pads (18), and die support means (12), for example a substrate or leadframe, which includes an array of electrically conductive leads. There is also disclosed herein a technique for wire bond connecting the bond pads of a particular die to either the bond pads (38) of a second die (34) or to the electrically conductive leads of the substrate or leadframe using a thermosonic or thermocompression ball bonding tool. In accordance with this technique, where at least one die is invovled, connections are made to the bond pads of that die by means of stitch bonding in a way which does not damage the die.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD OF AND ARRANGEMENT FORBOND WIRE CONNECTING TOGETHER CERTAININTEGRATED CIRCUIT COMPONENTSThe present invention relates generally to an integrated circuit package and other such electronic devices, and more particularly to a specific technique for wire bonding together certain components making up the integrated circuit package or other such devices.A typical integrated circuit package includes a die having an array of die output input bond pads and means for supporting the die, for example a substrate or leadframe, including an array of electrically conductive leads respectively connected to corresponding die bond pads by means of cooperating bonding wires. An example of such a package is illustrated in FIG. 1 and generally designated by the reference numeral 10. Integrated circuit package 10 is shown including a substrate 12 having on its top surface thereof an array of electrically conductive leads, one of which is indicated at 14. Substrate 12 supports a die 16 having an array of die output/input bond pads, one of which is indicated at 18. The electrically conductive lead 14 is shown connected with die bond pad 18 by means of an electrically conductive bonding wire 20. 

 In the particular example illustrated in FIG. 1 , a thermosonic or thermocompression ball bonding tool is used to first ball bond the free end of the wire 20 to pad 18, as indicated by the ball bond 22, and thereafter stitch bond the opposite end of the bonding wire to lead 14, as indicated by the stitch bond 24. The free end of a capillary 26 forming part of the overall ball bonding tool is shown completing the stitch bond at lead 14. It is conventional practice to make the first, ball bond at the pad on the die and the second, stitch bond at the lead on the substrate rather than the reverse. This is because, in most cases, conventional thermosonic or thermoÂ¬ compression wire bonding tools utilize capillaries that exceed the size of the bond pad which is typically 4 mils square. As a result, if the capillary 26 is used to make a second, stitch bond directly to die bond pad 18, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the capillary will, most likely, impact the passivation area and other features of the die immediately surrounding the pad, thereby possibly producing cracks, cratering and other damage. No such damage occurs when the capillary is used to connect wire 20 to pad 18, as illustrated in FIG. 1 , since the capillary always remains apart from the surrounding area of the pad by the thickness of ball bond 22.Even though it is
