<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a permanent-magnet DC motor having two rotation-speed levels, especially for driving domestic kitchen machines, as well as having a stator which is fitted with permanent magnets and having a rotor (9). At one end, the rotor has two commutators (8, 10) each having at least two commutator brushes (7, 11 and 13, 14 respectively) which are approximately diametrically opposite on a commutator (8 or 10 respectively), and, at the other end, it has two armature windings which are isolated from one another in DC terms and are connected to in each case one of the commutators (8, 10). The armature windings have approximately the same number of turns and the same wire cross-sections, using the same material selection. Furthermore, switching means are provided for connecting the commutator brushes (7, 11 and 13, 14 respectively) to an AC voltage mains power supply (1). The switching means consist of a bridge rectifier (5) and a switch (19). The two armature windings are electrically connected in series with one another and to the positive output (4) and negative output (16) of the bridge rectifier (5) via the commutator brushes (7, 11 and 13, 14). The switch (19) is connected between the connecting lead (12) which connects the two commutator brushes (11, 13), and one of the two AC voltage connections (17, 23) of the bridge rectifier (5). In consequence, the DC motor can be operated at two speed levels using simple switching means, without it being demagnetised and heated non-uniformly in the process.

A permanent-magnet direct-current motor having 
two speeds, in particular for driving kitchen apparatus 

for domestic use, with a stator equipped with permanent 
magnets and a rotor (9) including on the one side two 

commutators (8, 10) each with at least two commutator 
brushes (7, 11 and 13, 14, respectively) in approximately 

diametrically opposite arrangement on a commutator (8 or 
10), and on the other side two electrically isolated 

armature windings which are connected to a respective one 
of the commutators (8, 10) and have approximately the 

same number of turns per unit length and the same wire 
cross-sections with identical material selection, and 

with switching means being provided for connecting the 
commutator brushes 7, 11 and 13, 14, respectively) to an 

a.c. supply (1),
characterized in that
 the switching 
means are comprised of a bridge rectifier arrangement (5) 

and a switch (19), that the two armature windings are 
electrically connected in series via the commutator 

brushes (7, 11 and 13, 14) and are connected to the positive 
output (4) and the negative output (16) of the 

bridge rectifier arrangement (5), and that the switch 
(19) is inserted between the connecting line (12) connecting 

the two commutator brushes (11, 13) and one of 
the two a.c. terminals (17, 23) of the bridge rectifier 

arrangement (5). 
The permanent-magnet direct-current motor as 
claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the two armature 
windings have the same number of turns per unit 

length and the same wire cross-sections with identical 
material selection.  

 
The permanent-magnet direct-current motor as 
claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the wire 
cross-section can be selected so large that at the slow 

speed (both armature windings connected in series) no 
demagnetization occurs on the permanent magnets when the 

motor is switched on and/or stalled.
