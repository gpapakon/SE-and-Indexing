<ABSTRACT>
A portable radio apparatus comprising a first housing body (1,22) 
having at least a key operation pad (4, 24) with a plurality of 

keys, and a second housing body (2, 21) connected to the first 
housing body in such a manner that they are freely opened and closed 

with each other. The key operation pad (4, 24) of the first housing 
body (1, 22) is covered with the second housing body (2, 21), when 

necessary. The second housing body (2, 21) is provided with an 
opening (9, 29) or a push button (12, 32) so that at least one key 

is operated in a state in which the first and second housing bodies 
are closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a portable radio
apparatus, and in particular to an improvement in a portable radio
apparatus in which the key operation pad or-pushbutton dialing pad
can be covered with the housing body, when necessary.It is well known in a portable radio apparatus such as a
portable radio transmitter-receiver to adopt a folding structure
to enhance its portability. In the portable radio apparatus of the
folding structure type, when the cover is opened, the key operation
pad is exposed and the apparatus becomes a suitable size for use.
When the cover is closed, the key operation pad is covered and the
apparatus becomes handy to carry.A conventional portable radio apparatus such like this is shown
in FIG. 1 and disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application, publication
No. HEI 4-307841. In the figure, a housing main body 101 is
provided with a key operation pad such as a pushbutton dialing pad
102 and a microphone 103. A cover 106 with a speaker 105 is
rotatably connected through a hinge 104 to the upper end of the main
body 101. The cover 106 is freely rotatable on the hinge 104 in the
directions indicated by arrow marks A and B of FIG. 1. When the 
portable radio apparatus is in its inoperative state, the cover
106 is closed in the direction A and housed in the main body 101,
so that the key operation pad 102 is protected and the apparatus
becomes handy to carry. When, on the other hand, the portable
radio apparatus is in its operative state, the cover 106 is
opened in the direction B, the key operation pad 102 is exposed,
and then the microphone 103 and the speaker 105 are located into
a suitable position for use.However, in the above-described portable radio apparatus,
since the key operation pad 102 of the main body 101 will be
entirely covered if the cover 106 is closed, there was the
problem that the key operation cannot be performed unless the
cover 106 is opened.EP 0,414,365 describes a portable telephone comprising a
housing having a main body and an extending sleeve-like portion
mounted for longitudinal slidable movement between a retracted
position when not in use and an extended position for use. The
telephone is adapted to conceal selected ones of the keys when
it is in the closed position to prevent accidental activation of
those keys.It is, accordingly, an important object of the present
invention to provide a portable radio apparatus having a
structure which can enhance the key operability as the cover is
closed.The present invention provides a portable

<CLAIMS>
A portable radio apparatus comprising:

a first housing body (1,22) having at least a key operation
pad (4,24) comprising a plurality of keys; and
a second housing body (2,21) connected to said first housing
body (1,22) in such a manner that said first and second housing

bodies can be opened and closed with each other, said key
operation pad of said first housing body being covered with said

second housing body when closed;
said second housing body being provided with key operation
means (10, 30) for operating at least one key (5) of said

plurality of keys of said key operation pad in a state in which
said first and second housing bodies are closed;

   
characterised in that
 said key operation means comprises key
pushing means (10, 30) for operating at least said one key of

said plurality of keys of said key operation pad (4, 24) in a
state in which said first and second housing bodies are closed.
Portable radio apparatus as set forth in claim 1,
wherein said key pushing means (10, 30) comprises at least a

movable member (12, 32) energized by energizing means (11, 31)
in an opposite direction to a direction in which said plurality

of keys are pushed.
Portable radio apparatus as set forth in Claim 1 or
Claim 2, wherein said first housing body (1) and said second

housing body (2) are rotatably connected with each other so that
one housing body is rotatable on another housing body in a 

predetermined angle range.
Portable radio apparatus as set forth in any preceding
claim, wherein said at least one key of said plurality of keys

comprises a power-supply key (5, 25).
