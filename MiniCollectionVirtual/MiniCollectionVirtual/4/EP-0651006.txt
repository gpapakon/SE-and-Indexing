<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piperidinyl phosphite
composition, and more specifically, to a piperidinyl phosphite
composition which is useful as an additive for improving the
stabilization and transparency of crystalline propylene
polymer materials at lower processing temperatures.Typically, crystalline propylene polymer materials, such
as polypropylene and propylene polymer based copolymers have
found extensive use in various formed articles, such as
injection-molded articles, blow-molded articles, films, sheets
and fibers, because of their excellent mechanical properties.
However, due to their nature, crystalline propylene polymer
materials are to varying degrees unstable in regards, for
example, to oxidation and to ultraviolet radiation. In
addition to the above disadvantages, they are also poor in
transparency. To improve the transparency of polyolefins,
nucleating or clarifying agents are generally incorporated
therein as described in U.S. 4,388,119 which discloses a
composition consisting essentially of a solid powdery
dibenzylidene sorbitol coated with a higher fatty acid.U.S 3,640,928 and 3,840,494 and Canadian patent 997,353
disclose synthetic polymer compositions stabilized against
photo- and thermo-deterioration by adding a sufficient amount
of a piperidine derivative.Lower processing temperatures are preferred in the
industry to prevent the degradation or decomposition of the
propylene polymer material. However, at lower processing
temperatures white specks of unmelted and poorly dispersed
stabilizers and/or nucleators are found in the molded articles
because the processing temperatures are lower than the melting 
points of the particular stabilizer and/or nucleator being
used. Thus, there is a desire to find a way to use certain
stabilizers and nucleators at lower processing temperatures,
without obtaining white specks in the final product.It has been found in accordance with the present
invention that by forming an intimate mixture of a piperidinyl
phosphite compound with certain conventional additives, i.e.
certain nucleators and primary stabilizers, the melting point
of said additives is depressed or lowered. This enables the
additives to be processed at a lower temperature when
incorporated in polyolefins and provides products without the
white specking due to unmelted or poorly dispersed additives.According to one embodiment of the present invention
there is provided a phosphite composition consisting
essentially of (a) a piperidinyl phosphite compound of the
formula:
