<ABSTRACT>
N₂ implantation is used to increase the etch rate of a 
sacrificial oxide (sometimes referred to as the first gate 

oxide) in integrated circuitry. This implantation allows 
etching selectivity by changing the relative etch rates of 

materials. In the specific implementation described, a 
field oxide is also provided and this implantation increases 

the etch rate of the sacrificial oxide relative to that of 
the field oxide. No heat treatment having the ability to repair the 

damage caused by the bombardment is applied to the 

implanted material prior to etching.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the fabrication of 
integrated circuitry and, more particularly, to a process 
for increasing the etch selectivity of sacrificial silicon 
dioxide or other material. Ion implantation is commonly used in the fabrication of 
integrated circuitry to provide desired doping. Precise 
dopant distribution profile, dopant concentration and depth  
 
of implantation is attained by carefully choosing the 
parameters of implantation and those of the subsequent 
thermal annealing of the target. When ion implantation is 
used in the initial stages of integrated circuitry 
fabrication to provide doping for voltage threshold 
purposes, it is common to grow a silicon dioxide layer first 
to protect the substrate. This thermal oxide layer 
generally is referred to as a "sacrificial" oxide layer. 
(It also is sometimes referred to as the "first gate" 
oxide.) It typically is removed after ion implantation by 
subjecting the substrate to a diluent solution of 
hydrofluoric acid (HF) which may or may not be buffered. It is desirable in some fabrication processes to 
control the etch rate of the sacrificial oxide relative to 
other material on the same substrate that may come into 
contact with the etchant. For example, additional silicon 
dioxide material sometimes is deposited or grown in certain 
regions of a substrate, e.g., for shallow trench isolation, 
prior to exposure of the substrate to an etchant to remove 
the sacrificial oxide. This other oxide is commonly 
referred to as a field oxide. It is important that this 
field oxide maintain its planarity in view of further 
processing, e.g., the formation of crossover conductors on 
the same. Field oxide loss due to etching of a sacrificial 
layer is even a bigger problem if the field oxide is a LPCVD  
 
(low pressure chemical vapor deposition) layer, since field 
oxide deposited in this manner etches roughly 20% faster 
than conventional thermal oxide when both are exposed to 
agueous HF. Thus it is desirable to increase the etch rate 
of the sacrificial oxide so as to reduce unwanted etching of 
the field oxide. The present invention provides desired etch control and 
selectivity. From a broad standpoint, it includes the step 
of implanting the material to be etched with a multitude of 
implantation particles to increase its etchability by an 
etchant, e.g., a liquid, gas or a plasma. Such implantation 
will cause damage to the atomic lattice structure of the 
material. It is important that the material not be 
subjected to thermal
