<ABSTRACT>
In a tinted pair of lenses (10, 10') for 
overcoming the deleterious effects of nystagmic 

oscillations, particularly in persons suffering from 
dyslexia, the tinting varies along the lateral 

direction and extends in each lens over at least two 
zones (12, 14). A lighter tint is used in a first zone 

(12) extending from the lens edge (16) nearest to the 
nose of the wearer, when the lens is in use, to a 

position corresponding to the centre of the pupil, and 
a darker tint is used in a second zone (14) extending 

over the remaining lens area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for improving 
human vision by reducing nystagmic oscillations of the eye, 
and to lenses and spectacles for this purpose. More particularly, the invention is concerned with providing 
a method of concentrating in a forward direction the vision 
of a patient suffering from such oscillations and thereby to 
achieve a significant improvement in impaired reading and 
symbol recognition performance. Dyslexia is a developmental disorder concerning learning or 
language disability which may be explained by difficulties, 
in varying degrees, of auditory and visual discrimination, 
in difficulty in orienting in space and time, in analytical 
difficulties and in partial failures in short and long-term 
memory. A dyslectic will confuse similar printed musical notes, 
similar letters such as b, d, p, q and mathematical signs 
such as x and +. There will be difficulty in following the 
sequential order of letters in a word, such as confusing the 
words 'on' and 'no'. Studies have shown 5% to 10% of 
children being dyslectic, as broadly defined, to some 
degree. Obviously dyslectic children will perform poorly in school, 
and parents, suspecting defective eyesight, will often 
arrange for a child to undergo an eye examination. When the 
problem is one of nystagmic oscillations, the results of 
orthoptic and optic examinations will frequently fail to 
reveal any abnormality. A correct diagnosis can however be 
achieved by observation of the patient's eyes in response  
 
to the movement of an object placed 30 cm. from the eye of 
the patient and moved from center to left and from center 
to right. A known method of attempting to treat said oscillations is 
to subject the patient to a series of exercises, such as: 
a. prism exercises involving convergency and divergency; b. third degree synoptophoric sessions including foveal 
test; c. physidogie diplopia exercises; and d. reading exercises where part of the text not being 
presently read is covered with a white cardboard. The results of such treatment usually indicate some 
improvement, but the problem of nystagmic oscillations 
remains. In U.S. patent 4,961,640 Irlen proposes the use of tinted 
lenses for alleviating over-stimulation of receptor cells in 
the wave-length band of 425 to 575 nanometers. The symptoms 
suggested as benefiting from such lenses are reduced visual 
resolution, impaired peripheral vision, impaired depth 
perception and ocular vertigo. No suggestion is made 
regarding the treatment of nystagmic

<CLAIMS>
A tinted pair of lenses for overcoming the deleterious 
effects of nystagmic oscillations, particularly in persons 

suffering from dyslexia, said tinting varying along the 
lateral direction and extending in each lens over at least 

two zones, a lighter tint being used in a first zone 
extending from the lens edge nearest to the nose of the 

wearer, when the lens is in use, to a position corresponding 
to the centre of the pupil, and a darker tint being used in 

a second zone extending over the remaining lens area. 
The tinted pair of lenses as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
said first zone extends only from said lens edge to a first 

vertical line tangental to the corresponding position of the 
inner edge of the iris when the lens is in use, said lens 

being arranged to include a third zone provided with an 
intermediate degree of opacity, said third zone occupying an 

area extending from said first line to a parallel second 
line crossing a point corresponding to the centre of the 

pupil. 
The tinted pair of lenses as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
said lenses are standard prescription lenses being tinted. 
The tinted pair of lenses as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
said lenses are contact lenses. 
The tinted pair of lenses as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
said tinting gradually varies in opacity in the lateral 

direction, the lightest tint being used in said first zone 
and the darkest tint in said second zone. 
The tinted pair of lenses as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the colour used for said tinting is green. 
The tinted pair of lenses as claimed in claim 6, wherein 
the wavelength of the green colour falls within the range of 

5300 to 5400 angstrom units. 
The tinted pair of lenses as claimed in claim 6, wherein 
said colour used for said tinting is based on a combination 

of green and red to form a brown or gray tinted lens. 
Tinted lens spectacles for overcoming the deleterious 
effects of nystagmic oscillations, said tinting varying in 

the lateral direction and extending in each lens over at 
least two zones, a lighter tint being used in a first zone 

extending from the lens edge nearest to the bridge of said 
spectacles, to a position corresponding when the spectacles 

are in use, to the centre of the pupil, and a darker tint 
being used in a second zone extending over the remaining 

lens area. 
The tinted lens spectacles as claimed in claim 9, 
wherein said lenses are of the bi-focal type. 
The tinted lens spectacles as claimed in claim 9, 
wherein said lenses are of the multi-focal type. 
A method for overcoming the deleterious effects of 
nystagmic oscillations, particularly in patients suffering 

from dyslexia, said method comprising the interposition of 
at least one tinted transparent body acting as a filter 

between at least one eye of said patient and the object to 
be viewed, said tinting varying in the lateral direction and 

 
extending over at least two zones, a lighter tint being used 

in a first zone extending from a line near to the nose of 
the patient when the transparent body is in use, to a 

position corresponding to the centre of the pupil of the 
patient, and a darker tint being used in a second zone 

extending over the outer area of said transparent body.
