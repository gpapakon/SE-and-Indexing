<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the stabilisation of vesicles made up of a membrane of lipid phase containing at least one ionic and/or non-ionic amphiphilic lipid encapsulating an aqueous phase, in the form of a dispersion in an aqueous phase, by adding to the dispersion aqueous phase at least one stabilising agent in which the stabilising agent(s) is(are) chosen from the group made up of glycerol alginates, propylene glycol alginates, gelane gum and welane gum. The invention also relates to a composition for topical application containing the vesicles stabilised by the said process.
