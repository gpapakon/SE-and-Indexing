<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is a method for synthesizing films of zeolites which are bonded to substrates and the structures
made by this method. The structures may be used for separations, for the sorption of hydrocarbons, for catalysis, for
paraffin dehydrogenation and for Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of NOx.Synthetic zeolites have been used as adsorptive separation agents for gases and liquids, and as catalysts. Generally,
zeolites have been synthesized to yield a powder form of the crystalline material which can be formed or extruded
into granules, beads or pellets, often incorporated with a binder such as clay or alumina.Zeolites both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion-containing crystalline aluminosilicates.
These aluminosilicates can be described as a rigid three-dimensional framework of SiO4 and AlO4 in which the tetrahedra
are cross-linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to
oxygen atoms is 1:2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing aluminum is balance by the inclusion in the crystal
of a cation, for example an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio of
aluminum to the number of various cations, such as Ca/2, Sr/2, Na, K or Li, is equal to unity. One type of cation may
be exchanged either entirely or partially with another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional
manner. By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosilicate by
suitable selection of the cation. The spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration.Prior art techniques have resulted in the formation of a great variety of synthetic zeolites. The zeolite have come
to be designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as illustrated by zeolite A (U.S. Patent 2,882,243); zeolite X
(U.S. Patent 2,882,244); zeolite Y (U.S. Patent 3,130,007); zeolite ZK-5 (U.S. Patent 3,247,195); zeolite ZK-4 (U.S.
Patent 3,314,752); zeolite ZSM-5 (U.S. Patent 3,702,886); zeolite ZSM-11 (U.S. Patent 3,709,979); zeolite ZSM-12
(U.S. Patent 3,832,449); zeolite ZSM-20 (U.S. Patent 3,972,983); ZSM-35 (U.S. Patent 4,016,245); ZSM-38 (U.S.
Patent 4,046,859); and zeolite ZSM-23 (U.S. Patent 4,076,842), merely to name a few.The SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio of a given zeolite is often variable. For example, zeolite X can be synthesized with SiO2/Al2O3
ratios of from 2 to 3; zeolite Y, from 3 to 6. In some zeolites, the upper
