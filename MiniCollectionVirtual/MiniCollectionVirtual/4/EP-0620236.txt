<ABSTRACT>
A composition and process for making it are disclosed which teach multimodal 
particle size high impact monovinylaromatic polymer material having good 

gloss properties as well as high impact strength. The bimodal particle size 
rubber component of the material utilizes a small amount of a very large 

particle size rubber and a large amount of a very small particle size 
rubber. The unique and advantageous method of manufacturing the material 

involves introducing pre-existing pellets of a rubber/polymer blend into a 
monomer solution also containing a rubber capable of producing particles of 

a different range of sizes than that of the rubber component in the pellets, 
and polymerizing the monomer/dissolved pellet mixture into a multimodal 

particle size high impact material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
processes to obtain a highly useful product exhibiting increased gloss and
impact resistance.It is well-known that rubber reinforced polymers of monovinylaromatic
compounds, such as styrene, alphamethyl styrene, and ring-substituted
styrenes are desirable for a variety of uses. More particularly,
rubber-reinforced polymers of styrene having included therein discrete
particles of a cross-linked rubber, for example, polybutadiene, the discrete
particles of rubber being dispersed throughout the styrene polymer matrix,
can be used in a variety of applications including refrigerator linings,
furniture, household appliances, and toys. The conventional term for such
rubber-reinforced polymers is "High Impact Polystyrene" or "HIPS".The physical characteristics and mechanical properties of HIPS are dependent
upon many factors, including the particle size of the cross-linked rubber
particles. One of the most important characteristics of HIPS materials is
the ability of such materials to exhibit a high surface gloss which is
aesthetically appealing while also maintaining a high impact strength in
order to be desirable for use in articles such as furniture and appliances. It has been known that properties of HIPS such as impact and gloss are
strongly affected by rubber particle size and distribution at a given rubber
concentration. Unfortunately, these two main properties counteract each
other and the result is that the larger rubber particle utilized to obtain
strength and impact detracts from the appearance and gloss of the final
material. It has been known since the late 1970's that a small number of
large rubber particles when combined with a large number of small rubber
particles and blended into a HIPS material synergistically achieve a HIPS
with high impact and high gloss. The phrase commonly associated with
utilizing a combination of large and small rubber particles is "Bimodal
Particle Size Distribution" (BPSD) HIPS.BPSD HIPS is normally prepared by one of three known methods. The first
such method is melt-blending, the second is "parallel polymerization", and
the third is "split feed polymerization".In melt-blending, two HIPS materials of different particle size distributions
are blended together in an extruder or a mixer.In parallel polymerization, two independently polymerized mixtures, one of
which has small rubber particles and the other of which has large rubber
particles are combined prior to final polymerization in a third
polymerization reactor after phase
