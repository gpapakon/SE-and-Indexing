<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to voltage reference circuits, in 
particular voltage reference circuits for use in voltage 
regulating devices. Generally speaking, voltage regulators are designed to keep 
the voltage that they make available at their output 
terminals within one or more predetermined values, which 
must remain constant when the input voltage value varies, 
as a function of discrete ranges of fluctuation of such a 
value. Any variations in value of the output voltage ought to be 
an exact function of the system variables, such as the 
input voltage, the load applied to the output, and 
temperature. Such variations should be insignificant throughout the 
service range. In the automotive industry, voltage regulators are used to 
supply a charging voltage to a vehicle own battery(ies). In view of the environmental conditions of use of motor 
vehicles varying so widely, operating temperature is a 
factor of primary concern in designing the circuitry of 
voltage regulating devices, especially monolithically 
integratable ones. Individual automobile manufacturers adopt different methods 
of determining the voltage value versus temperature, and in 
fact, some of them arrange for the battery to be charged at 
a lower voltage when temperature goes up to ensure longer 
life for the battery, whilst others select a lower voltage 
at room temperature and arrange for the battery to be 
charged at a voltage unrelated to temperature.  Thus, the voltage available at the output terminals of a 
voltage regulator for automotive applications may be 
expressed, at a given temperature, as

Vout = Vamb + K (T - Tamb)   (1) 


 
where, Vamb and K vary between individual automobile 
manufacturers. An outstanding aspect of any voltage regulator design is 
its reference voltage. Monolithically integrated voltage 
regulators quite frequently use a reference of the bandgap 
type. Shown in the drawing is, in fact, a circuit diagram for a 
bandgap reference as used in voltage regulators for 
automotive applications. The main elements in said diagram are the transistors Q1 
and Q2 having their base terminals connected together, a 
current mirror formed by transistors Q3, Q4 wherein 
constant currents are flowed through the collectors of such 
transistors, and two resistors R1, R2 which determine the 
thermal drift of the output voltage from the bandgap 
reference. That portion of the circuit which includes the transistors 
Q5, Q6, Q7 and Q8 is an operational amplifier effective to 
accurately determine, in combination with
