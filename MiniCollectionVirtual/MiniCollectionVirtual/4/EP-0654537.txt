<ABSTRACT>
A manufacturing method for finishing hides with full split, grain, co 
rrected grain or any other type of skin or support, and later engraving 

them with a high frequency machine, consisting of adding, in successive 
stages, a chemical composed of different products added in different ratios 

in each of said stages in an amount on the order of between 15 and 60 g/square 
foot, the chemical being configured as a watery or solvent emulsion, 

and using, for its incorporation in the support, roller, screening, spraying, 
airless or aerograph machines and like, the support being dried after adding 

a layer of the chemical, and once the last stage has been finished, the support 
is totally dried, being subjected to the operation of a high frequency 

engraving machine in which the support carrying different layers of a chemical 
comes into contact with a silicone rubber, aluminum mould or like, the result 

being the obtaining of the pursued product, different operations designed to

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification refers to a patent of invention related 
to a manufacturing method for finishing hides with full 
split, grain, corrected grain or any other skin or support, and 
later engraving them with a high frequency machine, on silicone 
rubber, aluminum or similar moulds, in order to obtain a product 
-finished hides- to be utilized in several fields of the industry 
or trade, such as shoes, handbags, suitcases, workmanship, 
morocco leather articles in general, upholstery for pieces of 
furniture, cars, and so on, or where a hide can be used. This invention applies to the industry or trade dedicated to 
the treatment and finish of hides and later application in the 
footwear industry, morocco leather articles, upholstery for pieces 
of furniture or vehicles or any other branch both of trade 
and industry where a hide can be applied. As is known, hides are subjected to several treatments in order 
to obtaing afterwards an adequate product for configuring 
different manufactures. Obviously, the manufacture of high quality products uses hides 
according to the nature of the pursued object, such as the 
manufacture of shoes, handbags, suitcases or like, made with  
 
skins directly obtained from snakes, crocodiles, etc., raised to 
this end, these skins, after being obtained, are adequately treated 
to give them an appropiate consistence and elasticity allowing 
them to be later treated to carry out the manufacture. It is known the existence of different products in the marked, 
that using a low quality skin as a basic material, use a process 
for sticking a PVC and polyurethan film of a heavy density that, 
sticked on the skin support permits to eliminate some of the possible 
skin defects, such as scratches, etc. This low quality skin, 
once its treatment has been finished, gives a poor, plasticized 
appearance of low quality, and, above all, it limits very much 
its use and is destined to very cheaper products. Nevertheless, said achievement is obtained by means of presses, 
where the manufacture is performed only with parts of very 
reduced size (part of unitary cut of which the shoe is composed), 
so limiting the product to the shoe field, and, specifically, to 
the economic one, since, according to the Common Market rules, 
because its thickness it cannot be considered as skin, but only 
as a synthetic product. A solution to the present problem on this matter would be to 
manufacture a split hide, etc., of low quality that, once treated 
by its corresponding process, would have a

1.- A manufacturing method for finishing hides with full split, 
grain, corrected grain or any other type of skin or support, and 

later engraving them with a high frequency machine, of those destined 
to configure, after the achievement of the method, a support 

having own characteristics, totally different from the support - 
used for its transformation, showing a predetermined aspect, aft
er 
carrying out a treatment of the grain, full split, or on the 

corrected grain or other support in an adequate retanning and 
greasing process, characterized in that on the "grain" side of 

the full split, or on the corrected grain or other support, different 
stages of 15 to 60 g/square foot of a preparation of chemicals 

in a watery or solvent emulsion are deposited, the support 
being later dried in an oven after being additioned with the chemical 

layer, which, in subsiguient stages, is added with some different 
chemicals in succession, a roller machine, screening machine, 

airless gun, aerograph, etc., being used for depositing or 
adding the chemicals, the support being also subjected to the action 

of a pressing machine having a hot roller at a temperature 
of 50º to 300ºC, with polishing if necessary, and using an aerograph 

or roller machine for adding several chemicals, the support 
being at last fully dried, and being incorporated into a high 

frequency engraving machine, using a silicone rubber, aluminum or 
any other material mould, the result being the pursued product. 
2.- A manufacturing method for finishing hides with full split, 
grain, corrected grain or any other type of skin or support, and

claim 1, characterized in that in a first stage on the "grain" side 

of the full split or on the corrected grain, an amount of chemicals
