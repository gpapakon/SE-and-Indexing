<ABSTRACT>
An information processing system has a plurality 
of information processing units. Each information 

processing unit has a system console interface control 
unit (SCI) connected to an information processing unit 

body (COM) and a service processor (SVP). The 
plurality of system console interface control units 

(SCI) are connected each other in a ring fashion. Each 
system console interface control unit (SCI) has a 

processing means (80) for processing an interface 
between the self service processor (
SVPO) and the 
other-information processing unit body (COM1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to information 
processing systems and more particularly to information 
processing systems using a plurality of information 
processing units. An information processing system may have a 
plurality of information processing units which 
communicate with one another. Each unit has a main 
information processing section which performs the 
processing information function per se and is referred 
to hereinafter as an information processing unit body. 
At least some of the units may additionally have a so-called 
service processor to provide the information 
processing unit bodies with services such as 
microprogram loading or error processing. The 
following methods may be employed to allow the service 
processors to service the information processing unit 
bodies. One method has a plurality of system console 
interface control units which control interface or 
clock generation between a service processor and an 
information processing unit body. Each system console 
interface control unit is connected to at least one of 
the information processing unit body and a service 
processor if necessary. The system console interface 
control units are also bus-connected to one another. As a method to bus-connect the system console 
control units, a so-called "point-to-point method" 
which connects each of the system console interface 
control units has been proposed. Fig. 3 of the accompanying drawings shows the 
connection according to this previously-considered  
 
method when the number of service processors is equal 
to that of information processing unit bodies. 
However, if the system console interface control units 
are connected in that way by this "point-to-point 
method", when the number of service processors and 
information processing unit bodies is denoted by "m", 
the number of signal lines necessary for the connection 
is denoted by "mC₂". This means the connection will be 
physically difficult if the number of service 
processors and information processing units increases. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided an information processing system 
which comprises a plurality of information processing 
units each of which comprises an information processing 
unit body for processing predetermined information, a 
service processor for servicing microprogram loading 
and/or error processing for the information processing 
unit body and a system console interface control unit 
for connecting said information processing unit body 
with the service
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An information processing system comprising a 
plurality of interconnected information processing 

stations (SVP, SCI, COM), each processing station 
comprising an information processing section (COM), for 

processing data, and an interface unit (SCI), for 
interconnecting the processing stations, at least one 

of the processing stations further comprising a service 
unit (SVP) to provide a service for the information 

processing sections, characterised in that the 
information processing unit stations are interconnected 

by bus means (50) in such a way as to form a closed 
loop, enabling the or each service unit (SVP) to 

communicate with any one of the information processing 
sections (COM). 
An information processing system comprising a 
plurality of information processing units, said one 

information processing unit comprising: 
   an information processing unit body processing 

predetermined information; 
   a service processor servicing microprogram loading 

and error processing for said information processing 
unit body; and a system console interface control unit 

connecting said information processing unit body with 
the service processor of the other information 

processing unit, said system console interface control 
unit being connected in a ring fashion to the system 

console interface control unit of the other information 
processing unit. 
An information processing system claimed in 
Claim 2, wherein said processing means comprises: 

   process output means for receiving an access 
processing order for the information processing unit 

body of the other information processing unit from said 
 

service processor, for requesting a bus-use to two 
transmission directions of logical one side and an 

other side, and for proceeding an access processing by 
the transmission direction which first permits a 

bus-use; 
   processing input means for receiving an access 

processing order for said information processing unit 
body from at least an either direction of logical one 

direction and an other direction, and for proceeding 
said access processing by the direction from which said 

access processing order is transmitted; and 
   process relay means for receiving said access 

processing order for said information processing unit 
body from at least an either direction of said logical 

one direction and said other direction, for requesting 
said bus-use to a direction logically opposite to a 

direction from which said access processing order is 
transmitted, and for relaying to process said access 

processing when said bus-use is allowed. 
An information processing system claimed in 
Claim 2, wherein said system console interface control 

unit is given certain identification number, to 
determine a priority order between one and the other 

system console interface control units based on said 
identification number so that said process input means 

give priority to the access processing order 
transmitted from the system console interface control 

unit having a higher priority when receiving 
simultaneously said access processing order from two 

directions of logical one side and an other side. 
An information processing system claimed in 
Claim 2, wherein said processing input means give 

priority to the access processing order transmitted 
from logical one side when receiving simultaneously 

 
said access processing order from two directions of 

logical one side and an other side. 
An information processing system claimed in 
Claim 2, wherein said process input means give priority 

to the access processing order transmitted from a 
logical other side when receiving simultaneously said 

access processing order from two directions of logical 
one side and an other side.
