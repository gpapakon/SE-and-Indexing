<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine having a 
rotary crankshaft and pistons reciprocable in 

cylinders is tested for imbalance by suspending the 
engine from above to preclude vertical displacement 

of the engine and clamping the engine horizontally 
to preclude horizontal displacement thereof. Force 

sensors act on the engine to detect both vertical 
and horizontal forces imposed on the engine in 

response to rotation of the crankshaft by a 
crankshaft driver and resulting reciprocation of the 

pistons at speeds sufficient to cause the imposition 
of horizontal and vertical forces on the engine by a 

moving, unbalanced mass. The forces may be measured 
and oriented to enable the imbalance to be 

corrected. The cylinders are evacuated during 
rotation of the crankshaft to avoid the imposition 

of loads on the moving parts of the engine during 
the test. Changes in torque due to changes in the 

speed of rotation of the crankshaft may be detected 
by load cells which are responsive to rocking 

movements of the crankshaft driver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus
for detecting imbalance of an assembled
workpiece, such as an internal combustion engine of
the kind having a rotary crankshaft and
reciprocating pistons.Some manufacturers of automotive internal
combustion engines require that each assembled
engine be tested dynamically to minimize vibration
that may be transmitted from an unbalanced engine to
the vehicle in which the engine is installed. Some
engine manufacturers balance each individual
component prior to its inclusion in the final
assembly with other components on the theory that,
if each component is balanced, an assembly of such
components also will be balanced. All components,
however, are manufactured to tolerances. It is
possible, therefore, that the tolerances may
accumulate in such manner as to produce a condition
of imbalance in one or more of the subassemblies,
thereby resulting in the generation of unacceptable
vibrations even though all of the component parts of
the assembly are within the tolerance applicable to
each such part.Other engine manufacturers assemble all of
the component parts in the engine and thereafter
perform a balance test. This kind of balance 
testing, without ensuring that all of the components
themselves are within tolerance limits, runs the
risk of including in an assembled engine grossly
imbalanced component parts. This can require an
excessive amount of balance correction if an engine
is to meet specifications.The presence of an unbalanced mass in an
automotive engine of the kind having a rotary
crankshaft and reciprocating pistons normally
generates two vibration frequencies. The truly
rotary elements, such as the crankshaft and a
portion of each connecting rod, as well as the
flywheel and the front damper/pulley assembly,
generate a first order vibration once during each
revolution of the crankshaft. Reciprocating
pistons, piston pins, and the remaining portions of
the connecting rods generate second order vibrations
twice for each revolution. For example, an engine
running at a speed of 1200 rpm will generate 20 HZ
first order vibrations and 40 HZ second order
vibrations if the respective rotary and
reciprocating components are not balanced.The conventional method of measuring
engine imbalance is to mount the engine on flexures
at both the front and rear of the engine which
permit displacement of the engine due to imbalance
in each of two horizontal planes perpendicular to 
the crankshaft. Horizontal velocity or displacement
sensors located at each end of the engine

including at least one rotatable element (60), said

apparatus comprising means (55) for positioning said
workpiece in a test position; means (20) for

rotating said element (60), while said workpiece (56) is in
said position, at a speed sufficient to cause a

moving, unbalanced mass to exert a force on said
workpiece (56) tending to move said workpiece (56) relative to

said position; restraining means (72, 81) comprising
means (72) for suspending said workpiece (56) from above

and clamp means (81) movable into and out of
engagement with said workpiece (56) along a substantially

horizontal path; force sensing means (85, 87) acting
on said workpiece (56) for sensing force applied on said
