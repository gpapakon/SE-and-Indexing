100% elongation, modulus MC of rubber chafer (46) rubber 
at 100% elongation and modulus MS1 of 1st stiffener (40) 

rubber at 100% elongation have the relationship of 
MS

MS2
<
MC
<
MS1; and a point C is located between a 
point A and a point B, where the points A and B are tire 

surface points which depart from rim flange (21A) when 
the tire is mounted on a normal rim (21) and inflated at 

normal inflation pressure and loaded with 100% weight 
and 200% weight respectively of normal load, and the 

point C is the foot of a perpendicular (H1) to the tire

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic radial tire 
for aircraft such as passenger jet airplanes. Various kinds of radial tires exclusive for aircraft are 
used for aircraft such as passenger jet airplanes. In 
some of these tires, the same rubber is used for the 
sidewall rubber and rubber chafer. If the same rubber 
as used for the sidewall is used for the rubber chafer, 
since the rubber is soft, there is a possibility that 
air cells may occur in the rubber and the rubber chafer 
may blow-out under tire service conditions of high heat 
generation. Also, the rubber chafer may be worn out by 
chafing with the wheel rim after long distance tire 
service. On the other hand, if the same rubber as used 
for the chafer is used for the sidewall, there is the 
possibility that so-called ozone cracks may occur at the 
sidewall. Since there occurs considerable load concentration at 
bead portions when large weight is loaded on a radial 
tire having flexible sidewalls, the modulus of 2nd 
stiffener rubber (2nd stiffeners provided at the bead 
portions and extending along the axially outer surface 
of the carcass) at 100% elongation is sometimes made 
larger than the modulus of the chafer rubber at 100% 
elongation so as to increase bending (flexural) rigidity  
 
of the bead portions. In this case, since the 2nd 
stiffener rubber is too rigid, there is the possibility 
that the 2nd stiffener may blow-out under tire service 
conditions of high heat generation. Also, the 2nd 
stiffener may be separated after long distance tire 
service. A tire of this kind, which discloses the features of the 
preamble of claim 1, is shown by FR-A-2 670 160. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
pneumatic tire for aircraft which prevents or at least 
reduces such damage as rim chafing, blow-out and 
separation. The present invention provides a pneumatic radial tire 
for aircraft, comprising: 
a carcass composed of a main portion extending from 
a tread portion through sidewall portions to bead cores 
of bead portions and turn-up portions turned up around 
the bead cores, a part of the carcass being turned up 
from the inside to the outside of the tire and 
terminated in the vicinity of the bead cores, another 
part of the carcass being turned up from the inside to 
the outside of the tire and extended to the sidewall 
portions, and the remainder of the carcass being turned 
up around bead cores from the outside to the inside of 
the tire and terminated in the vicinity of the bead 
cores so as to cover the
