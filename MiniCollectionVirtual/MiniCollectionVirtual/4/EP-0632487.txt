<ABSTRACT>
We have found that etching of a body (10) that comprises exposed Si 
(15) as well as a Ti-comprising metal layer (13) (e.g., a patterned Ti/Pt layer) in an 

amine-based anisotropic etchant for Si (e.g., 100°C EDP) frequently results in 
undesirable changes in the Ti-comprising metal layer. We have also found that the 

changes can be substantially reduced or eliminated by electrolytic means, namely, by 
making the metal layer the anode in an electrolytic cell that contains the etchant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to making a silicon body with a metal layer 
thereon by a process that involves anisotropic etching of the silicon body. The metal 
layer may be present in the completed article or may only be present at an 
intermediate stage of the manufacture. Anisotropically etched silicon bodies (typically Si wafers) with a 
patterned metal layer thereon are advantageously used for a variety of purposes. For 
instance, such a combination finds use in a technology that is frequently referred to 
as "silicon optical bench" (SOB). See, for instance, US patent 5,179,609, which 
discloses exemplary embodiments of SOB technology. In a typical manufacturing process, a patterned SiO2 layer is provided 
on a major surface (typically 100-oriented) of a Si body, with a patterned metal layer 
on the SiO2, and exposed regions of Si are anisotropically etched by means of 
contact with an amine-containing anisotropic etchant for Si. Frequently, the metal 
layer comprises Ti, typically a Ti layer disposed directly on the SiO2. Furthermore, 
the metal layer frequently comprises one or more other metals disposed on the Ti 
layer. Exemplary of these other metals are the platinum metals. It is at least very desirable that the step of anisotropically etching Si 
does not produce any significant changes in the metal layer, since such changes are 
likely to have a negative impact on device performance and/or reliability. US-A-4.765.865 discloses a method for increasing the etch rate of a single crystal 
silicon wafer in an anisotropic etching solution, whereby a mask material is applied 
to a portion of one face of the wafer and a metal coating to substantially the 
entire surface of an opposite face of the wafer. Further an auxiliary electrode may be connected to the metal coating, which coating is in direct contact with the silicon wafer. We have found that etching Si in an amine-based anisotropic etchant 
such as EDP (ethylenediamine pyrocatechol) frequently results in undesirable 
changes in the, simultaneously contacted, Ti-comprising metal layer. We have also 
found how to decrease or avoid the changes. The novel method involves 
electrolysis. More particularly, the invention is embodied in a method of 
manufacturing an article that comprises, at least at some stage of its manufacture, a 
Si body that has a major surface, with a patterned dielectric (exemplarily SiO2) layer 
on the surface, and with a patterned Ti-comprising metal layer on the dielectric layer. 
The dielectric layer and metal layers are
