<DESCRIPTION>
Copending U.S. Patent Application, Serial No. USSN 800,335,
filed contemporaneously
herewith and meanwhile published as US-A-5,267,016 contains related subject matter to that disclosed
herein.This invention relates to distance measurement and
more particularly to laser diode coherent interference-based
distance measurement. More precisely, the invention relates to a laser-based
distance measuring device for measuring the distance to a cooperative
target having predetermined highly reflective properties as well as to a
laser-based distance measuring device for measuring the level of a liquid.It is known that semiconductor lasers, such as laser
diodes, may be used for measuring distances as described
by: G. Beheim et al, "Range Finding Using Frequency-Modulated
Laser Diode", Applied Optics, Volume 25, No. 9
(1986). It is also known that light may be used to
measure the level of a liquid.A laser diode typically has an optical cavity
comprising two opposing polished ends (called facets)
each having a known index of refraction and having a
light amplifying medium therebetween. Light is generated
inside the diode cavity by passing electric current
through the p-n junction of the diode (typically using
ends of the diode other than the facets). The light
inside the diode cavity is reflected from a first (e.g.,
front) facet to a second (e.g., rear) facet in a
repetitive manner, thereby providing stimulated emission
and the well known laser action. Typically, the front
and rear facets are partially transparent (i.e., not 100%
reflective). Thus, some light exits the laser from both 
the front and rear facets. The amount of light exiting
an uncoated facet is determined by its index of
refraction.The behavior of a laser diode, as is known, can be
significantly affected by external optical feedback,
i.e., feedback of a portion of the laser output light
back into the laser cavity from an external reflecting
surface, as described in the article: R. Lang et al,
"External Optical Feedback Effects on Semiconductor
Injection Laser Properties", IEEE Journal of Quantum
Electronics, Volume QE-16, No. 3 (March 1980). A laser
diode together with an external reflective surface, e.g.,
a reflective target, can be viewed as a compound or
coupled laser cavity consisting of the diode cavity and
an external cavity formed by the reflective target and
the laser diode facet facing the target (e.g., the front
facet). The distance from the laser to the external
surface must be no longer than one-half the coherence
length (the distance over
