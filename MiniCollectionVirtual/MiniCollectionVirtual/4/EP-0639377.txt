<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biologically active 
vitamin D analogues useful as antagonists of progesterone 
suggesting a potential use for birth control. The 1α-hydroxylated metabolites of vitamin 
D -- most importantly 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ and 
1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₂ -- are known as highly potent 
regulators of calcium homeostasis in animals and humans, 
and more recently their activity in cellular differentiation 
has also been established. V. Ostrem et al, Proc. 
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, (1987), 84, 2610. As a 
consequence, many structural analogues of these metabolites, 
such as compounds with different side chain structures, 
different hydroxylation patterns, or different 
stereochemistry, have been prepared and tested. Important 
examples of such analogues are 1α-hydroxyvitamin D₃, 
1α-hydroxyvitamin D₂, various side chain fluorinated 
derivatives of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃, and side chain 
homologated analogues. Several of these known compounds 
exhibit highly potent activity invivo or invitro, and 
some of these have been found to exhibit an interesting 
separation of activities in cell differentiation and 
calcium regulation. This difference in activity provides 
these compounds with advantageous therapeutic activity 
profiles and thus numerous of these compounds are in use, 
or have been proposed for use, in the treatment of a 
variety of diseases such as renal osteodystrophy, vitamin 
D-resistant rickets, osteoporosis, psoriasis, and certain 
malignancies. Recently, a new class of vitamin D analogues 
has been discovered, i.e. the so-called 19-nor-vitamin D 
compounds. 19-nor-vitamin D compounds are vitamin D 
analogues in which the ring A exocyclic methylene group 
(carbon 19) typical of all vitamin D compounds has been  
 
removed and replaced by two hydrogen atoms. Specifically, 
these compounds exhibit a selective activity profile 
with high potency in inducing cellular differentiation, 
and minimal bone calcification activity. Such a differential 
activity profile renders these compounds useful 
for the treatment of malignancies, or the treatment of 
various skin disorders. Two different methods of synthesis 
of these 19-nor-vitamin D analogues have been described 
(Perlman et al, Tetrahedron Letters 31, 1823 
(1990); Perlman et al, Tetrahedron Letters 32, 7663 
(1991), and DeLuca et al, U. S. Patent 5,086,191). In Teutsch et al, U. S. Patent 4,386,085, a 
19-nor-steroid (referred to as RU 486) having strong 
antiprogesterone and antiglucocorticosteriod activities 
is described.
