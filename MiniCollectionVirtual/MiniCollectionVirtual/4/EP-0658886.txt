<ABSTRACT>
An optical recording medium is provided with a masking 
layer (102) on a side of a recording layer (103) for receiving a reproducing 

beam. The masking layer (102) is prepared from that containing 
photochromic dye molecules having absorption at the 

wavelength of the reproducing beam and causing a photon mode 
reaction by absorbing the reproducing beam to be reduced in 

absorption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
recording and reproducing methods for
an optical recording
medium which is capable of high-density recording and reproduction.In recent years, the so-called MSR (magnetically induced
super resolution) system is watched with interest as
super resolution means for recording/reproducing information
in/from a region smaller than a recording spot which is
decided by a light diffraction limit. Examples of such an
MSR system are disclosed in Technical Digest of Optical Data
Storage Topical Meeting 1991, Vol. 5, pp. 112 to 115 (Lecture
No. TuB-3) and pp. 116 to 119 (Lecture No. TuB-4), for
example. This system is characterized in that a magneto-optical
recording film consisting of a plurality of layers
is employed with provision of a masking layer for masking
peripheral information other than that of an information
recording layer. Recorded information (recorded marks) is
transferred to the masking layer which is increased in
temperature by irradiation with a relatively strong reproducing
beam, whereby influences by adjacent tracks and 
recorded marks in a linear density direction are suppressed
and the optical resolution is improved even if the recording
density is increased.As to an optical recording medium for attaining a
similar super resolution effect, Japanese Patent Laying-Open
No. 5-225611 (1993) discloses a medium which is provided
with a layer including a light absorption center causing
nonlinear light absorption such as saturable absorption as a
masking layer, for example. The saturable absorption is
such a property that electrons are efficiently excited when
the beam intensity is weak since most of electrons in the
absorption center are in ground states while the ratio of
electrons excited from ground states is reduced when the
beam intensity is strong since most of electrons are excited.
Thus, this layer absorbs light when the light intensity
is low, while its absorbance is reduced when the light
intensity is increased. When the medium which is provided
with the layer having such a saturable absorption property
is irradiated with a strong reproducing beam for reproducing
information, therefore, the reproducing beam will not reach
the recording layer in the periphery of its spot due to high
absorption for low light intensity, while the reproducing
beam can reach the recording layer around the center of the
spot due to small absorption for high light intensity.
Thus, it is possible to attain a super resolution effect 
similarly to the aforementioned MSR

A method of recording information in a recording layer of an optical
recording medium comprising:


a recording layer (103); and
a masking layer (102) containing photochromic dye molecules having
absorption at a reproducing wavelength, which undergo a photon mode

reaction by absorption of reproducing light, such that the absorption of the
masking layer is reduced at said reproducing wavelength;
said method comprising the steps of:
irradiating said masking layer (102) with a beam of a wavelength for
improving transmittance of said masking layer (102) at the wavelength of

a recording beam by a photon mode reaction; and then
transmitting said recording beam through said masking layer (102)
which is improved in transmittance

for irradiating said recording layer (103) with said recording beam.
A method of reproducing recorded information in a recording layer of
an optical recording medium comprising:


a recording layer (103); and
a masking layer (102) containing photochromic dye molecules having
absorption at a reproducing wavelength, which undergo a photon mode

reaction by absorption of reproducing light, such that the absorption of the
masking layer is reduced at said reproducing wavelength;
said method comprising the steps of:
irradiating said masking layer (102) with a beam of a wavelength
being different from the wavelength of said reproducing beam for reducing

transmittance of said masking layer (102) at said wavelength of said reproducing
beam by a coloring reaction of said photochromic dye; and then
irradiating said masking layer (102) with said reproducing beam,
while relatively moving said optical recording medium with respect to said

reproducing beam, to cause a bleaching reaction of said photochromic dye
and improved transmittance of a portion of said masking layer (102) corresponding

to a rear portion of a reproducing beam spot at said reproducing
wavelength, thereby allowing said reproducing beam to reach said recording

A method of reproducing in accordance with claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 said masking layer is irradiated with said beam of a wavelength being
different from the wavelength of said reproducing beam so that the optical

density of said masking layer at the wavelength of said reproducing
beam is at least 0.3.
