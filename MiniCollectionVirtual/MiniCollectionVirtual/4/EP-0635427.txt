<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for forming and applying a sealing 
flap to seal the mouth of a filled sack, starting from 

a continuous strip (9) of heat-sealable material 
includes a first loop conveyor to unwind the strip from 

the feeder roll and transfer it, using clamp means 
(10, 11, 12, 13) and guide means (14), to a second loop 

conveyor (15), likewise provided with clamp means (21, 
22, 23, 24) to hold the strip (9). Between the first 

and the second conveyor (1, 15) cutting means (28, 29) 
are provided to cut the strip (9) when the section of 

the latter transferred to the second conveyor (15) has 
reached a pre-set length corresponding to the width of 

the sack (31) to be sealed. The second conveyor is 
associated with a shaping device (26) which, during 

advance of the strip (9), folds the strip itself until 
it is substantially in the shape of an upside down U, 

thus forming the sealing flap (32). The second 
conveyor (15) moves between a first upturned position 

around the end adjacent to the first conveyor (1), 
corresponding to the formation stage of said sealing 

flap (32), and a horizontal position, corresponding to 
the positioning stage of the sealing flap (32) over the 

mouth of the sack (31) to be closed ready for 
subsequent sealing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
the formation and application of a sealing strip to 
seal the mouth of a filled sack, starting from a 
continuous strip of heat-sealable material. At the present time, various systems exist for 
closing filled sacks made of heat-sealable material, in 
particular in sack filling machines. Among these, the most simple and widely used 
involves heat sealing of the edges of the sack mouth, 
generally using a special device with heated bars, 
which seal the mouth of the sack together between them. However, if the sack is filled with certain 
powdery or adhesive materials, the material with which 
the sack is filled is deposited on the inner surfaces 
of the sack itself, including the inner surfaces of the 
mouth, so that the above mentioned sealing operation 
becomes difficult or impossible. In order to solve the problem mentioned above, a 
length of a strip of sheet material is used, generally 
the same material used to form the sack, and this strip 
is folded over and sealed to the opposite outer 
surfaces of the mouth of the sack, so as to seal it. The systems for performing this operation are 
many, and include the manual application of the strip, 
or mechanical devices which fold the strip and assemble 
it on the mouth of the sack (see e.g. US-A-4 567 711). Obviously, manual application of this sealing 
strip is extremely uneconomical, as it involves a 
notable waste of manpower and time. On the other hand, 
the mechanical devices employed up to now have not 
shown themselves to be suitable for the job involved, 
so that application of the sealing strip is incorrect, 
resulting in faulty sealing of the mouth of the sack in 
question, and consequent leakage of the material 
contained therein when moved. The object of the present invention is to provide  
 
an apparatus for formation and application of a sealing 
flap to seal the mouth of a filled sack, starting from 
a continuous strip of heat-sealable material, capable 
of performing the operation in question in a 
surprisingly reliable and exact manner such as to 
guarantee perfect sealing of the sack, thus avoiding 
the problems found when using similar devices according 
to the prior art. The apparatus according to the present invention 
comprises a first loop conveyor to unroll 
the strip from a supply roll and to transfer it, with 
the aid of clamp means and guide means, to a second 
loop conveyor, also provided with clamp means to hold the 
strip. Between the first and the second conveyor

An apparatus for the formation and application 
of a sealing flap on the mouth of a filled sack, 

starting from a continuous strip of heat-sealable 
material, wherein it comprises: a first 

loop conveyor (1) and a second loop conveyor (15) adjacent to, 
and in line with 

one 
another, of which the first serves to unwind a strip 

(9) of heat-sealable material from a feeder roll and to 
pass said strip on to said second conveyor; means (10, 

11, 12, 13; 21, 22, 23, 24; 25) to hold said strip (9) 
in a releasable manner 

at the under side of 
said first and second 

conveyor; cutting means (28, 29) arranged between said 
first and second conveyor to cut a length of 

strip (9) received on said second conveyor from said 
first conveyor; means (26) on said second conveyor 

capable of giving said length of strip (9) the shape of 
an upside down U, so as to form said sealing flap (32) 

to seal the mouth of a filled sack (31). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, in which 
said first and second conveyor are endless chain 

conveyors mounted on respective sprocket wheels (2, 3; 
16, 17), of which one is a driving wheel and the other 

a driven wheel, capable of rotating around respective 
shafts (4, 5; 18, 19). 
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, in 
which said means for holding said strip (9) associated 

with said first and second conveyors are respective 
plenum chambers (11, 21) in communication with said 

strip, a vacuum being established in said chambers so 
as to generate a suction force sufficient to cause said 

strip to adhere to said first and second conveyors. 
An apparatus according to anyone of the 
preceding claims, in which said second conveyor (15) 

further comprises, as additional means for holding the 
strip (9), a number of spaced hooks (25). 
An apparatus according to anyone of the 
preceding claims, in which said cutting means are a  

 
blade (28) activated by a hydraulic actuator (29). 
An apparatus according to anyone of the 
preceding claims, in which said means for giving said 

length of strip (9) the shape of a U are formed by a 
forming channel (26) associated to said second conveyor 

(15) and so shaped as to form said sealing flap during 
advance of said length of strip along said forming 

channel. 
An apparatus according to anyone of the 
preceding claims, in which said second conveyor (15) 

further includes means (27) for returning said second 
conveyor to its correct starting position ready to 

start a new cycle on completion of the previous one, 
comprising position sensors (27) which actuate means 

for energize and de-energize a pair of electrical 
elements driving said second conveyor (15) to the 

starting position thereof. 
An apparatus according to anyone of the 
preceding claims, in which said second conveyor (15) 

further comprises actuating means (30) to produce a 
rotation thereof ar
ound its end adjacent to said first 
conveyor (1) from a first upwardly inclined position, 

which corresponds with the stage during which said 
sealing flap (32) is formed and does not interfere with 

translation of said sack (31) between the filling 
station and the sealing station, and a second 

horizontal position, which corresponds with the stage 
during which said formed sealing flap (32) is applied 

to the mouth of the sack (31) in said sealing station.
