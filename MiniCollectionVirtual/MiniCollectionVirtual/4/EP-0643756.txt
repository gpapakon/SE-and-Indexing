<ABSTRACT>
A method for converting organic material into a product gas includes: a) providing a liquid reactant mixture containing liquid water and liquid organic material within a pressure reactor; b) providing an effective amount of a reduced metal catalyst selected from the group consisting of ruthenium, rhodium, osmium and iridium or mixtures thereof within the pressure reactor; and c) maintaining the liquid reactant mixture and effective amount of reduced metal catalyst in the pressure reactor at temperature and pressure conditions of from about 300  DEG C to about 450  DEG C and at least 130 atmospheres for a period of time, the temperature and pressure conditions being effective to maintain the reactant mixture substantially as liquid, the effective amount of reduced metal catalyst and the period of time being sufficient to catalyze a reaction of the liquid organic material to produce a product gas composed primarily of methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods for the destruction of organic
materials, and more particularly to methods for converting organic materials into
a product gas composed primarily of methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen.The quantities and types of organic waste being generated have grown
significantly in recent years. Many of these organic wastes are hazardous in that
they present significant environmental and health hazards. Hazardous wastes
previously disposed of by unacceptable methods continue to be discovered in
various waste sites. Improved methods for treatment and disposal of these
hazardous wastes are required to meet environmental standards and to treat these
wastes in a cost-effective manner.Recently, there have been increased research efforts aimed at improving
the method used to remediate hazardous materials at problem waste sites. For
wastes containing hazardous organics and water, it is desirable to destroy the
organics so the water can be reused or discharged to ground or surface water
streams. Thermal technologies currently being developed and employed for
destruction of organic material includes incineration, wet air oxidation and
supercritical oxidation.Several commercial treatment technologies exist for treating low organic
content water streams (<1000 ppm) by using conventional water purification
methods and for treating high concentration streams (>10%) by various costly
methods, including solvent extraction and incineration. However, there exists the
need to be able to treat concentration ranges not presently commercially treatable
(1-5%), as well as other concentration ranges.Conversion of some waste organic materials, such as contained in biomass
materials, to low-Btu fuel gas, carbon monoxide and hydrogen by pyrolysis and
substoichiometric burning at 500° C to 800° C and about 101.325-1013.25 kPa (one to ten atmospheres)
is well known. Studies undertaken to optimize such processes have demonstrated
that high temperatures with or without catalysts are required to minimize tar and
char formation in the reaction. Recent interest in organic conversion has been 
aimed at production of a medium-Btu fuel gas through the use of a steam
and/or oxygen gasification environment. These processes would produce a cleaner
carbon monoxide/hydrogen gas mixture which would be used for synthesis of
methane as well as other products.U. S. Patent 4,239,499 to Pfefferle discloses a process for converting a
stream containing 25% or more methanol into a product gas. However, this
process has
