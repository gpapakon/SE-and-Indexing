<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a chimney arrangement which is constructed with a plurality of parts and is composed of an outer shell, of an inner shell formed by inner pipes, and, if appropriate, of an insulating layer introduced between outer shell and inner pipe, having in each case one connection piece which is formed at the lower end of the upper inner pipe and at the upper end of the following lower inner pipe, with the result that each inner pipe (1; 10, 11) exhibits at least one connection piece (14, 16) with an outer thread (6; 14, 16).

Chimney construction built with multiple parts, 
comprising 


an outer shell, an inner shell formed by inner tubes (1; 
10, 11) and possibly an insulating layer between said outer 

shell and said inner shell, 
with a joining portion (14, 16) being formed at the lower 
end of the upper tube (1; 10) as well as at the upper end of 

the subsequent lower inner tube (1; 11) respectively, 
characterized in that
each inner tube (1; 10, 11) consists of a ceramic, 
pressed, dried and burned blank and that said inner tube is 

provided with an external screw thread at least at one joining 
portion (14, 16), 
wherein said external screw thread (6; 17, 18) is 
threaded after the burning operation. 
Chimney construction built with multiple parts according 
to claim 1, 


characterized in that
each inner tube (1) is provided with an internal screw 
thread (4) at its other joining portion. 
Chimney construction built with multiple parts according 
to claim 1, 


characterized in that
each inner tube (10, 11) is provided with an external 
screw thread at its two joining portions (14, 16). 
Chimney construction built with multiple parts according 
to claim 1 or 2, 


characterized in that
at least one joining portion of each inner tube is 
expanded to a muff (2) in which an internal screw thread (4) 

is formed. 
Chimney construction built with multiple parts according 
to claim 3, 


characterized in that
a lubricant is provided between said internal and 
external screw thread (4, 6) of two inner tubes. 
Chimney construction built with multiple parts according 
to claim 1, 


characterized in that
the screw pitch of the internal screw thread (20) of a 
muff (19) is selected to be smaller than or equal to the 

double screw pitch of a joining portion (14, 16). 
Chimney construction built with multiple parts according 
to one of the preceding claims, 


characterized in that
a gasket ring or suchlike is arranged between the 
sectional surfaces or front surfaces of neighboring inner 

tubes (10, 11). 
Chimney construction built with multiple parts according 
to one of the preceding claims, 


characterized in that
said front surfaces of said inner tube are formed 
conical. 
A method for manufacturing a ceramic tube for chimney 
constructions, 


wherein a ceramic blank is pressed in a tube form, 
wherein said ceramic blank is held after pressing in a 
wet condition with a humidity content of approximately 17%, 
said ceramic blank is subsequently dried to a humidity 
content of 1% or less, wherein 
said ceramic blank is burned after the drying, and 
wherein after the burning an internal and/or external screw 

thread (4, 6; 17, 18) is threaded.
