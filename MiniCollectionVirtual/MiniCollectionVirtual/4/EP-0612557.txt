<ABSTRACT>
By means of a method for the uniform distribution of a small amount of liquid onto the surface of finely divided solids, characterised in that the said liquid is sprayed by means of one or more ultrasonic jet(s) onto the finely divided solids to be treated before or during, or before and during mixing of the said solids in a mixing apparatus, granules, powder or dusts can be dedusted by the use of very small amounts of liquid. The method according to the invention is also suitable for applying emulsions, solutions, dispersions or melts onto the surface of solid particles. The invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying out the said method, characterised in that one or more ultrasonic jet(s) is or are combined with a mechanical or pneumatic mixer.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the uniform distribution of a small 
amount of liquid onto the surface of finely particulate 

solids, which comprises spraying said liquid by means of 
at least one ultrasonic nozzle onto the finely particulate 

solid to be treated, before or while, or before and 
while, said solid is mixed in a mixing appliance. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
finely particulate solid is a granular dye or dye powder. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the sprayed-on liquid is a mineral oil, a vegetable oil, 

a glycol, an alkoxylate, glycerol, a glycol ether, a glycerol 
ether, a fatty amine or a mixture of said liquids. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 
1 to 3, wherein the sprayed-on liquid is diethylene 

glycol, hexylene glycol or a fatty alcohol polyglycol 
ether. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 
1 to 3, wherein the sprayed-on liquid is an oil-water 

emulsion, preferably a mineral oil emulsion. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 
1 to 4, wherein the sprayed-on liquid is an aqueous solution, 

a dispersion or a melt of a compound intended to be 
distributed onto the surface of finely particulate 

solids. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 
1 to 6, wherein the amount of the liquid to be sprayed 

onto the surface of the finely particulate solid is from 
0.001 to 15 % by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 1 % by 

weight, based on the weight of the solid employed.  
 
An appliance for the uniform distribution of a 
small amount of liquid onto the surface of finely particulate 

solids, wherein at least one ultrasonic nozzle is 
combined with a mechanical or pneumatic mixer. 
The appliance as claimed in claim 8, wherein the 
ultrasonic nozzle has a throughput of from 2 g/h to 

100 kg/h, preferably from 20 g/h to 800 g/h. 
The appliance as claimed in claim 8 or 9, wherein 
the ultrasonic nozzle employed is an ultrasonic axial 

atomizer which generates a liquid jet in the form of a 
slender solid cone having an angle of from 10 to 200°, 

preferably from 10 to 50°, in particular from 10 to 20°, 
operates at a frequency of from 20 to 100 kHz, preferably 

at 60 kHz, and generates a droplet spectrum whose maximum 
of the relative frequency distribution is between 15 and 

25 µm. 
The appliance as claimed in at least one of 
claims 8 to 10, wherein at least one ultrasonic nozzle is 

arranged in or near the mixer inlet. 
The appliance as claimed in at least one of 
claims 8 to 11, wherein at least one ultrasonic nozzle is 

arranged in the interior of the mixer at as large a 
distance as possible from the mixing tools and the vessel 

walls. 
The use of an ultrasonic nozzle in combination 
with a mixing appliance for the uniform distribution of 

a small amount of liquid onto the surface of finely 
particulate solids.
