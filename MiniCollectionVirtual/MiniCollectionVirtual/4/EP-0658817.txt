<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for developing
an electrostatic latent image which is formed in
electrophotography, electrostatic printing, or electrostatic
recording.At present, as various kinds of practically used
dry-type developing methods in electrostatic copying,
two-component developing methods using a toner and a carrier
such as iron powders, magnetic one-component developing
methods using a toner in which particulate magnetic
materials are incorporated in the inner portion of the toner
without using a carrier, and nonmagnetic one-component
developing methods using a toner containing no particulate
magnetic materials therein have been known.In recent years, the equipments utilizing
electrophotography have been widely used in the fields of
printers and facsimiles besides conventional copy machines.
Particularly in the downsize printers and facsimiles, since
the copy device portions have to be miniaturized, the
one-component developing methods are mainly used.Specifically, the two-component developing methods
differ from the one-component developing methods in that the 
weight of the developer is heavy because the carrier
particles are contained therein. Further, in the
two-component developing method, the toner concentration in
the two-component developer has to be maintained at a given
level, so that a device for detecting the toner
concentration and automatically supplying a necessary amount
of the toner is required, and thereby the overall developer
device becomes larger and heavier. By contrast, in the
one-component developing method, since such a device would
not be necessary, the overall machine can be advantageously
made smaller and lighter.On the other hand, in various copy machines, high-speed
printing and stability of forming images have always been in
demand. Therefore, presently two-component developing
methods are used as a main stream for speeded-up machines,
such as medium-speed machines and high-speed machines.In addition, the toner for two-component developers is
colored with such coloring agents as carbon blacks, and
other components contained in the toner comprise mainly
polymers. Therefore, the toner particles are light, and
there are no other forces than electrostatic forces to
adhere the toner particles to the carrier particles, so that
particularly in high-speed development, toner scattering is
likely to take place, which in turn may cause in the
long-term use staining on optical lenses, table glass, and
paper conveying portions. Thus, the stability of the
forming
