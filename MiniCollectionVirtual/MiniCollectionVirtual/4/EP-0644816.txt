<ABSTRACT>
A nut wrench device, especially for loosening or tightening wheel nuts or similar (22), comprising an input axle (1) having operating means (3, 23), an output axle (17) having actuating means (19-21) disposed at one of its ends, which actuating means (19-21) has a non-round peg (20) on which a nut socket or the like (21) is non-rotatably secured for wrenching said nut (22), a force transmission mechanism (7-16, 24, 26-29) which links the input axle (1) with the output axle (17), and anchoring means (5, 25) to anchor the nut wrench device on a second wheel nut (6) spaced from said nut (22), whereby a force applied to the operating means is transmitted as a torque to the nut (22) which is to be wrenched. Novel in the invention is that the anchoring means (5, 25) is disposed at one end of the input axle (1) and the operating means (3, 23) is disposed at its second end (2), and the force transmitting mechanism (7-16, 24, 26-29) comprises a link member (9) which is connected to the input axle (1) via its first end and connected to the output axle (17) via its second end (2), the link member (9) being disposed substantially at right angles to both the input axle (1) and the output axle (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a nut wrench 
device, especially for loosening or tightening wheel nuts 
or similar, according to the first part of the patent claim. More particularly, the invention is primarily directed to 
a manual device for initially loosening a nut or bolt 
which is hard to budge, for example due to it having been 
tightened too hard or to its threads having stuck in its 
receiving thread because of corrosion, material migration, 
mechanical damage or similar. When the jammed thread 
engagement has been released, the nut or bolt can 
afterwards be loosened with a socket wrench, a cross-shaped 
wheel wrench or the like, or by also using the 
device of the invention therafter. Conversely, a jammed 
(hard tightened) receiving thread can also be obtained 
with a final tightening with the device according to the 
invention. Devices for tightening or loosening nuts or bolts have 
been previously described in many variations and a device 
which is particularly suited to wheel nuts is shown in 
Swedish patent specification no. 8400756-6 (publication 
no. 446 700), which comprises a gear mechanism disposed in 
a housing, an output axle disposed on one side of the 
housing, an adjustable anchoring means disposed on the  
 
same side, and an input axle disposed on the opposite side 
of the housing. The anchoring means comprises a peg set 
fast on a sliding body which is axially translatable 
along, and in profile-bound sliding engagement with, a 
guide rail. Although this device functions as intended, it 
is, however, beset with certain drawbacks. The sprocket 
mechanism to provide the mechanical advantage is an 
unnecessarily expensive and complicated solution, 
additionally requiring an enclosed and protective housing 
which also serves as the supporting means for the 
incorporated components. This leads to the device being 
comparatively heavy, requiring relatively large storage 
and working spaces and above all to the housing, during 
use, covering the wheel nuts and consequently obstructing 
threading of the wheel nut sockets onto the associated 
wheel nuts or bolts. Additionally, the device is difficult 
to use on vehicles having double wheel sets, such as the 
rear wheels of trucks and similar.  
 A nut wrench device according to the preamble of the claim is 
previously known through SE-A-457 698. A sleeve is rigidly 
attached to an end of an operating arm in the neighborhood of an 
attachment of a sleeve receiving an output axle rotating a wheel 
nut. A nut wrench according to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A nut wrench device, especially for loosening or 
tightening wheel nuts or similar (22), comprising an 

operating means (23), an output axle (17) having actuating 
means (19-21) disposed at one of its ends, which 

actuating means has a non-round peg (20) on which a nut 
socket or the like (21) is non-rotatably secured for wrenching 

said nut (22), a force transmission mechanism (16, 24, 27-29) 
which links the operating means (23) with the output axle 

(17), and anchoring means (5) to anchor the nut wrench device 
on a second wheel nut (6) spaced from said nut (22), whereby a 

force applied to the operating means is transmitted as a 
torque to the nut (22) which is to be wrenched, the anchoring 

means (5) is disposed on the operating means (23) and a socket 
member (16) is enclosing and slidably arranged on said output 

axle (17), 
characterized
 in that the force transmitting mechanism 
(16, 24, 27-29) comprises a head (24) integrated with one 

end of said force transmission mechanism (23), 
an input axle (1) disposed substantially at the 

periphery of the head, a bore (28) disposed substantially 
at the periphery of the head opposite said anchoring 

means (5), the anchoring means (5) and said bore (28) being 
spaced 

mutually and with respect 
to a longitudinal axis of said operating means 

(23), and a peg (29) which is projecting from the socket 
member (16) at an angle to the axle of said socket member and 

which is adapted to be received in said bore (28) of said head 
(24), and in that said anchoring means (5) comprises a nut 

socket (5) rotatably and removably received on an input axle 
(1), 

said input axle (1) 
being rigidly attached to said head (24).
