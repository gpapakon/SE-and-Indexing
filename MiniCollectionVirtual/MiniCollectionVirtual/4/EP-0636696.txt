<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a major histocompatibility angiten class II protein (MHC class II) found, for example, on the surface 
of an antigen presenting cell; a material having the MHC class II immobilized thereon, prepared by linking the MHC class 

II, the subunits α and/or β of the MHC class II, or a part thereof to a material such as bead, fiber or hollow yarn through covalent 
linkage; and a superantigen-removing module prepared from the material. The invention also provides a method of detecting 

or assaying a superantigen by using the MHC class II or that part of the MHC class II which has an affinity for a superantigen, 

and an assay kit therefor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing major histocompatibility antigen class II
protein (hereinafter referred to as "MHC class II" for
short) occurring on the surface of antigen-presenting
cells and the like.MHC class II occurs on the cell surfaces of B cells,
macrophages, endothelium cells in blood vessels and the
like. MHC class II is a glycoprotein used for
distinguishing self from others. Recently, it was found
that MHC class II is a binding protein which binds to a
group of proteins called superantigens such as toxins of
bacteria, and the subtypes of MHC class II in patients
suffering from autoimmune diseases are peculiarly
distributed, so that it is now regarded as importance in 
the field of medicine and immunology.Superantigens are a group of proteins which bind to
MHC class II on antigen-presenting cells without being
processed in the antigen-presenting cells unlike
conventional antigens, and form complexes with MHC class
II so as to stimulate T cells having a specific V region,
thereby abnormally activate immune system.Superantigens hitherto confirmed include
Staphylococcusaureus toxin, Streptococcus toxin,
Yersinia toxin, some kinds of virus proteins and heat
shock proteins. Superantigens may also be identified in
the future.At present, to isolate and obtain MHC class II, it
is necessary to introduce MHC class II gene in mammalian
cells or insect cells and express the gene, or it is
necessary to purify naturally occurring MHC class II from
cell membranes of B cells, macrophages, endothelium cells
in blood vessels and the like.However, for obtaining naturally occurring MHC class
II from cell membranes in a large scale, a large number
of cells are necessary because the amount of MHC class II
on the surface of the membranes is small, so that this
method takes a long time and a large cost even if
cultured cells are employed.Similarly, for producing recombinant MHC class II by
mammalian cells or insect cells by a genetic
recombination technique, a large cost and a long time are 
required for culturing the cells.Although system for expressing major
histocompatibility antigen class I protein by using
Escherichiacoli has been reported (K.C. Parker et al.,
Molecular Immunology, Vol. 29, 371 (1992)), no such an
expression system is known for MHC class II.Conventional materials to which MHC class II is
bound include those in which whole cells expressing MHC
class II on the cell surfaces are adsorbed on a plate,
and those in which chemically synthesized amino acid
sequence that is a

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing α or β subunit of major
histocompatibility antigen class II protein, comprising

the steps of:

transforming a microorganism with a gene encoding
said α or β subunit of major histocompatibility antigen

class II protein;
expressing said gene in the transformed
microorganism so as to produce said α or β subunit of

major histocompatibility antigen class II protein as an
insoluble protein;
recovering the produced insoluble protein;
converting the recovered insoluble protein to a
soluble protein; and
purifying obtained soluble protein to obtain
functional α or β subunit of major histocompatibility

antigen class II protein.
