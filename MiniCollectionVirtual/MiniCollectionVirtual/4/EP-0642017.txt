<ABSTRACT>
The control of the flow of a stream of supercritical fluid 
into a supercritical fluid instrument (100) are disclosed. 

The present invention provides a system whereby a 
reciprocating pump (16)is connected to a source of carrier 

fluid (10) and creates an output stream of supercritical 
fluid at a set pressure and rate. A pressure transducer 

(20) is used to create a signal indicative of this pressure 
prior to its flow through the supercritical fluid instrument 

(100), and the signal is used to control a pressure 
regulating valve (22) which is connected to the output 

stream. The output stream is also connected to the 
supercritical fluid instrument (100) and this connection is 

most preferably disposed between the pressure transducer 
(20) and the pump (16). In this manner, a substantially 

continuous flow of an output stream of supercritical fluid 
at a set pressure results. Other embodiments permit a 

source of liquid modifier to be selectively merged with the 
supercritical carrier fluid using a second pump (17) and a 

mixing tee (24). In any embodiment, the pressure control 
systems disclosed are readily converted into flow control 

systems by reconfiguring the instrument (100) and the 
pressure transducer (20) in series. In a preferred 

embodiment this is accomplished using a set of remotely 
actuated six port valves (40,42).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for 
performing analytical chemistry, and more particularly to 
supercritical fluid chromatography. In the field of chromatography, the analysis conditions must 
be carefully controlled in order to obtain repeatable 
results. One parameter that must be tightly controlled is 
the mass flow rate of the "mobile phase" or carrier fluid 
that flows through an instrument, such as a chromatograph 
column. As well known to those of ordinary skill, there are 
two general techniques for regulating mass flow rate. One 
technique involves carefully controlling the fluid flow rate 
in the system, and is typically used in liquid 
chromatography. A second technique requires regulating the 
system pressure and is most frequently used in gas 
chromatography. The unique nature of supercritical fluids permit either flow 
control or pressure control to be used effectively. In 
fact, it is possible to use a combination of these 
techniques through the implementation of a controllable 
variable restrictor. In supercritical fluid applications,  
 
flow control is most frequently used in systems with large 
packed columns, where relatively high flow rates are 
required. On the other hand, the low flow rates inherent in 
micropacked and capillary column supercritical fluid 
chromatographs lend themselves to pressure control. The pressure control systems found in the prior art 
typically use a syringe pump. For example, as shown in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,681,678 -- Leaseburge et al. a syringe pump 
that provides supercritical fluid to either a supercritical 
fluid extractor or supercritical fluid chromatograph can be 
controlled by regulating a flow control valve connected to 
the syringe pump air supply. The valve controls the amount 
of air admitted to the syringe and thus maintains the 
pressure of the output stream above the critical pressure. 
However, syringe pump systems suffer from several 
disadvantages, the primary disadvantage being that the 
syringe must be refilled, resulting in a discontinuous flow. 
Additionally, the nature of syringe pumps and their 
associated hardware precludes easily converting such 
pressure controlled systems to flow controlled systems. As 
supercritical fluids find their way into more and more 
applications, this latter disadvantage will become 
increasingly severe, since different supercritical flow 
systems will have to be constructed for different types of 
instruments and applications. It is also known to control pressure by regulating
