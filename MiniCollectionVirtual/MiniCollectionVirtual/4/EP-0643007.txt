<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure for 
fixing the guide rails (3) of an elevator 

car (4) and/or counterweight, in which 
procedure the guide rails (3) of the elevator 

car and counterweight are fixed to 
the wall (12) of the elevator shaft or to 

an intermediate member laid across the 
elevator shaft. The car guide rails (4) 

and counterweight guide rails (3) are 
locked at a desired distance from the 

wall by means of the fixing elements (11) 
used to fix the counterweight guide rails 

(3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for adjusting
and fixing the guide rails of an elevator car and/or
counterweight to an elevator shaft and to a wall construction
according to the preamble of claim 6.Such a procedure and wall construction is known from
US-A-2,463,215.In the case of a concrete shaft, the guide rails are most
commonly fixed by means of rail clamps directly to C-profile
rails provided in the shaft walls. In shafts shared by several
elevators in a bank, when no partitions are provided,
intermediate members are used to which the guide rails are
fixed by means of rail clamps. The guide rails can be fixed
to the shaft wall by means of sturdy threaded bars welded
onto plates fixed to the wall. A structure like this is ill
suited for custom processes as it requires several work
phases.Intermediate members are often used in an elevator shaft
e.g. to divide the shaft into two or more sections, each
section accommodating a separate elevator car running along
guide rails fixed to the intermediate members. Intermediate
members can also be used in connection with counterweights
or to fit an elevator car in an oversized elevator shaft.Previously known rail fixing methods have the drawbacks that
the guide rails are difficult to adjust because of the rigid
welded joints used and that the safety aspects relating to
installation require a great accuracy on the part of the
person performing the welding, who is generally an elevator
installer, not a professional welder. In practice, in the
fixing of guide rails, allowance has to be made for fairly
large tolerances in the elevator shaft and the rail fixing
elements in it, resulting in longer installation times.
Further problems result from the difficulty of extending
power cables to the various welding points in the elevator
shaft. The object of the present invention is to avoid the above-mentioned
drawbacks and to achieve a procedure for fixing
the guide rails and their supporting structures in an elevator
shaft quickly and so as to obtain sufficient rigidity
without welded joints. The procedure of the invention is
characterized by what is presented in the characterization
part of claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are
presented in the other claims.The advantages provided by the present invention include the
following:
well suited for installation without scaffoldingevery screw joint can be tightened by using one and the
same spannerall screws and nuts are the same sizethe distance between the counterweight guide rails as well
as

Procedure for fixing the guide rails for an elevator car
and counterweight, in which procedure the car guide rail

(4) and the counterweight guide rails (3) are fixed to a
wall (12) of the elevator shaft or to an intermediate member

laid transversely across the shaft, 
characterized
 in that
the fixing elements (11) used to fix the counterweight guide

rails (3) are also used to lock the car guide rail (4) and
the counterweight guide rails (3) at a desired distance from

the wall.
Procedure for the fixing of guide rails according to
claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the wall mounting members (1)
are provided with an elongated hole (8) suitably placed in

the wall mounting member (1), said elongated hole (8)
enabling the car guide rails (4) and counterweight guide

rails (3) to be adjusted in a direction perpendicular to the
shaft wall.
Procedure for the fixing of guide rails according to
claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the fixing parts (13 and
2) used to fix the guide rails (3 and 4) are provided with

round holes (14 and 20) by means of which the car and counterweight
guide rails (3 and 4) are fixed and locked with

respect to each other.
Procedure for the fixing of guide rails according to
claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized
 in that the wall mounting
members (1) are fixed to the shaft wall (12) and adjusted by

means of elongated screws (6) and (7) provided in said
members.
Procedure for the fixing of guide rails according to any
one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that the car
guide rail (4) is adjusted to the correct height and distance

with respect to the shaft wall (12) by means of elongated
holes (6, 7 and 8). 
Wall mounting construction for fixing the guide rails (3,4)
of an elevator and counterweight to a wall (12) of an

elevator shaft,

characterized in that the
wall mounting construction comprises a mounting structure and

fixing elements (11) for fixing the
car guide rail (4) to the mounting structure and

for the fixing of the counterweight guide rail (3)
to the mounting structure, wherein said respective fixing

elements are identical, and
that the wall mounting construction enables an adjusted fixing

of the guide rails at a desired distance from the elevator
shaft wall (12).
Construction according to claim 6, comprising a wall
mounting member (1) for connecting the guide rails (3,4) to the

shaft wall (12), the wall mounting member (1) being provided
with an elongated hole (8) enabling the car guide rails (4)

and/or counterweight guide rails (3) to be adjusted in a
direction perpendicular to the shaft wall.
