Internal gear pump with an internally toothed hollow wheel, two axial discs 
arranged on both sides of the hollow wheel, a driven externally toothed pinion 

arranged off-centre relative to the hollow wheel and in engagement with the 
hollow wheel, and a sickle-shaped float mounted filler piece divided in 

peripheral direction, which rests at its blunt end on an axial support bolt, of 
which the first segment facing the teeth of the pinion has a greater radial 

thickness than the second segment facing the teeth of the hollow wheel, 
whereby the first segment in the divided surface has at least one axial groove for 

mounting a sealing element, characterised in that the first segment (18) has at 
least one stop (28, 34, 44, 58, 60) for restricting the wear (54) of the surface 

facing the teeth of the pinion (14). 
Internal gear pump according to claim 1, characterised in that the stop is 
designed as a mechanical stop (28) and is arranged in the region of the pointed 

end (32) of the first segment (18) in connection with the axial discs (13). 
Internal gear pump according to one of claims 1 to 2, characterised in that a 
second mechanical stop (34) is designed in the region of the blunt end (36) of 

the first segment (18) in connection with the axial discs (13). 
Internal gear pump according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
stop (28, 36) is designed as a pin (40) fitted into an axial bore (38) in the axial 

disc (13), which pin engages in a corresponding axial bore (42) in the first 
segment (18), which has a larger diameter than the pin (40). 
Internal gear pump according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
stop (28, 36) is designed as a pin (40) fitted into an axial bore in the first 

segment (18), which pin engages in a corresponding axial bore in the axial disc 
(13) which has a larger diameter than the pin (40).  

 
Internal gear pump according to claim 1, characterised in that the stop is 
designed as a hydraulic stop (44) in the form of at least one blind groove (46) 

facing the first segment (18) and arranged in the side surfaces of the axial discs 
(13), which connects at its open end (52) to the pressure build-up side (56) of 

the pump (10) and the blind end (48) is arranged so that with the successful 
restriction of wear (54) it opens to the pressure side (50) of the pump (10). 
Internal gear pump according to claim 1, characterised in that the stop is 
designed as a hydraulic stop (44) in the form of at least one blind groove (47) 

arranged on the side surfaces of the first segment (18) which with its open end 
(52) is in connection with the pressure side of the pump, and the blind end (48) 

is arranged so that it opens with the successful restriction of wear to the 
pressure side of the pump. 
Internal gear pump according to claim 1, characterised in that between the first 
segment (18) and the second segment (20) there is a connection (58) to the 

restriction of the gap width in the region of the divided surface (22) after the 
successful restriction of wear (54). 
Internal gear pump according to claim 1, characterised in that a restriction (60) 
is provided for a rotational movement of the support bolt (17) to restrict the wear 

of the surface (30) of the first segment (18) facing the teeth of the pinion (14). 
Internal gear pump according to claim 9, characterised in that the restriction (60) 
is designed as a stop element (62) on the bearing surface (64) of the blunt end 

(36) of the filler piece (16) on the support bolt (17) on the rear side of one of the 
axial discs (13) or in the bearing cap (66). 
Internal gear pump according to claim 9, characterised in that the restriction (60) 
is designed by means of a tight fit of the support bolt (17) in the axial discs (13) 

or the bearing caps (66).
