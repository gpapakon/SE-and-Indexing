<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for manufacturing photovoltaic modules made from laminates. The process has the following steps: (a) a modular stack (2) of previously stacked solar cell system, encapsulating materials and separating foils is brought to the loading station (1); (b) the modular stack (2) is conveyed to a vacuum laminator (5) which is then closed and evacuated, and the modular stack (2) is heated up to the softening temperature of the plastic sealing layers arranged in the encapsulating materials by pressing the heating plate (21) on the thermoconductive support plate (3); (c) the composite (2') formed after the vacuum laminator (5) is aired without cooling once again the heating plate (21) is conveyed to the hardening furnace (10); (d) the hardened laminate (2") is then conveyed to the cooling zone (12); and (e) the finished laminate is removed from the removal station (14) at the end of the manufacturing process. Steps (a) to (e) are cyclically carried out at the same time and in parallel.
