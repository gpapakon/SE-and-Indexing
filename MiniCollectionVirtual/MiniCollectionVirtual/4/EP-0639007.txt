<ABSTRACT>
A radio receiver front end has a greater dynamic range than 
those in the prior art. An illustrative embodiment of the present 

invention comprises both feedforward and feedback mechanisms 
(231,227,229,211,213,219,221,223) to supress the amplitude of 

spurious signals so as to prevent those signals from flooding the 
dynamic range of the mixer (217) used to mix down the signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods for processing an input
signal.FIG. 1 depicts a schematic diagram of a typical radio front end inthe prior
art. Signals are received at antenna 101 and are filtered to a desired range of frequencies
by bandpass filter 105. Low noise amplifier 107 amplifies the filtered signals to fully
exploit the dynamic range of mixer 117. Local oscillator 125 creates a periodic signal
which mixer 117 uses to mix-down the signals to a frequency range such that bandpass
filter 119 can isolate the desired signal. This technique is advantageous in that it
permits the radio to be tuned by adjusting the frequency of local oscillator 125. Mixer
117 must mix-down the desired signal in addition to any undesired signals which
fortuitously are also in the frequency band passed by filter 105. This can be
disadvantageous if the amplitude of the undesired signals is greater than the amplitude
of the desired signal because the undesired signals fill the dynamic range of mixer 117
so as to inhibit the full exploitation of the dynamic range for the benefit of the desired
signal.US-A-4,991,165 discloses an interference canceller for cancelling an
interfering signal generated by an interfering source from a transmission link between
an antenna and a receiver. The interference canceller derives a sample of the interfering
signal from the interfering source and down converts the sample to an intermediate
frequency. A computer controlled delay path and computer controlled amplitude and
phase modulator interactively adjusts a cancellation signal that is injected into the
transmission link between the antenna and receiver to maximize the amplitude match
between the cancellation signal and the interfering signal, and anti-phase the
cancellation signal with respect to the interfering signal.According to one aspect of this invention there is provided apparatus as
claimed in claim 1.According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a method
as claimed in claim 9. Embodiments of the present invention are capable of isolating the desired
frequencies while avoiding many of the costs and restrictions associated with prior
techniques. In particular, embodiments of the present invention can suppress the
amplitude of the undesired frequencies such that the dynamic range of the mixer is
effectively increased. These results are obtained in an illustrative embodiment of the
present invention in which a feedback signal is employed, along with a feedforward
signal, to suppress the amplitude of
