<ABSTRACT>
An economical process, amenable to large-scale production, is 
disclosed for the preparation of 2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine (d4T) 

from 5-methyluridine. The process employs a novel, 5'-benzoyl-2'α-halo-3'α-alkanesulfonylthymidine 
intermediate as well as a highly 

efficient and practical deprotection, isolation and purification procedure 
for the d4T product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process suitable for large-scale
manufacture of the anti-HIV agent, purified d4T. This process uses 5-methyluridine
as the starting material.The compound d4T (2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine) has been
approved for use in the treatment of AIDS. The drug has been named
stavudine by USAN and is marketed as ZERIT.™ To date, d4T has been
made from an expensive starting material, thymidine. Altemative
methods of making this antiviral agent have been explored in order to
find a more cost-effective process that would lead to a more economical
method of preparing the large-scale amounts of d4T needed for a
commercial drug. In this regard, not only is the expense of starting
materials and reagents considered but process steps, processing time,
materials handling, as well as ecological impact and health and safety
concems must also be taken into account.Four main methods have been previously used for the
transformation of a less expensive ribonucleoside, 5-methyluridine, (5-MU)
to d4T:
(1) the Corey-Winter thermal decomposition of a cyclic
thionocarbonate derivative of 5-MU with trialkyl phosphite. See
L. Dudycz, Nucleosides and Nucleotides, 8 (1), 35-41 (1989);(2) the Eastwood reaction in which the cyclic orthoester of 5-MU
fragments to yield the corresponding d4T derivatives. See
H. Shiragamai et al, J. Org. Chem., 1988, 53, 5170-5173; (3) the reductive elimination of a 2',3'-bisxanthate derivative of
5-MU using tributyltin hydride. See C. K. Chu et al, J. Org. Chem., 1989,
54, 2217-2225; and(4) zinc reductive elimination of cis-2'-halo-3'-carboxylic esters
to yield 2',3'-olefinic nucleosides. See M. Mansuri et al, J. Org. Chem.,
1989, 54, 4780-4785.These methods have certain drawbacks. The major problem with
(2) and (4) is significant cleavage of the nucleo-bond leading to
generation of thymine as a difficult-to-remove by-product. Among other
shortcomings, methods (1) and (3) both require selective 5'-OH group
pre-protection.The zinc reduction of vicinal bromo-tosylates to olefins is
disclosed in Cristol & Rademacher, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1959, 81, 1600-1602.Zinc reduction of a 2'bromo-3'-methanesulfonyl ester has been
used to prepare 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrouridine derivatives. See
Ishida, et al, Kokai No. JP 05097847-A, 5 [1993].Furukawa et al, describe the production of a 2',3'-dideoxyuridine
via Pd hydrogenation of a 2'-bromo-2'-deoxy-3'-mesyluridine derivative
in Chem. Pharm. Bull., 18, 554 (1970). This process, however, will not
result in isolation of a product with a
