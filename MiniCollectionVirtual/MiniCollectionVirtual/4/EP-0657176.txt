<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition
containing a water-insoluble or slightly water-soluble
compound with enhanced water-solubility. Specifically. it
relates to a composition containing a water-insoluble or
slightly water-soluble compound useful as medicaments,
cosmetics, agricultural chemicals, food and drink, etc, the
water-solubility of the compound being enhanced by combining
it with a branched cyclodextrin-carboxylic acid which is a
novel cyclodextrin derivative.It is the most general and important problem in the
field of pharmaceutics to enhance the water-solubility of
water-insoluble or slightly water-soluble drugs.
Cyclodextrins have been used as effective means to solve this
problem. Cyclodextrins have been used as food additives or
cosmetic additives, or for providing suitable volatility or
improving taste or smell, or for emulsification, powdering or
stabilization, as well as for enhancing solubility of
medicaments or agricultural chemicals. It is believed that
these effects of cylcodextrins are produced by the formation 
of complexes containing active ingredients of pharmaceutical
compositions, etc., in the cyclodextrins.Various homologs of such cyclodextrins are known.
Their water solubilities vary with their kinds. For example,
α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins consist of six, seven and eight
glucose units, respectively, that are joined in such a way as
to form a ring, and it is reported that the water-solubilities
of α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins are about 15%, about 2% and
about 23%, respectively.Incidentally, to enhance the water-solubility of
water-insoluble or slightly water-soluble compounds by using
a cyclodextrin, the cyclodextrin per se must have a high
water-solubility. However, the water-solubilities of
conventionally used cyclodextrins are unsatisfactory.Cyclodextrins used in medicaments to enhance the
water-solubility of water-insoluble or slightly water-soluble
compounds must be highly safe for the human body because they
are administered to the human body as injections, etc. Thus,
there is a need for cyclodextrins that form suitable complexes
with drugs to promote solubilization of the drugs in water and
have no harmful effect on the human body. The main object of the present invention is to provide a
composition containing a water-insoluble or slightly water-soluble
compound with enhanced water-solubility.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
method of enhancing solubility in water of a water-soluble or
slightly water-soluble compound.These objects as well
