<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides for the angular and lateral 
adjustment of a pair of fixator rods in an infinite number 

of planes. The angular adjustment member (10) may be 
rotated about a center axis of the connector such that the 

connected fixator rods may be angled relative to one 
another in any plan
e called for. Similarly, the lateral 
adjustment (12) may be rotated about the center axis of the 

connector (10) such that the two fixator rods may be 
shifted laterally relative to one another in any direction. 

The adjustable connector (10) provides for the adjustment 
of the fixator rods after the rods have been connected to 

the bone pins. Therefore, after a surgeon has reduced and 
stabilized the fracture, minor adjustments can be carried 

out to fully align the bone fragments without disconnecting 
the fixator rods or the bone pins. After all adjustments 

have been made, a series of locking bolts or pins 
(20,44,132,116) can be engaged to hold the adjustable 

connector in a fixed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to external fixators as used in
the reduction and stabilization of long bone fractures and
has specific relevance to an adjustable link for
positioning between a pair of fixation rods.External fixators used for the reduction and
stabilization of long bone fractures are well known in the
field of orthopaedics. Typically the fixator includes an
elongate rod which has a plurality of bone pins connected
thereto by a series of clamps. A limitation with prior art
fixators occurs when after the fixator and bone pins are
connected, the surgeon notes that one of the sections of
fractured bone is out of alignment. With prior art
fixators which have a single elongate rod to support the
bone pins, the surgeon would be required to disconnect some
or all of the pins so that the fracture may be realigned.While pivotally linked fixator rods have been
developed to minimize the problem, the direction of
movement is limited. Such a device is disclosed in EP-A-431
441.This invention provides for the angular and lateral
adjustment of a pair of fixator rods in an infinite
direction about the longitudinal axis of the connector.
The angular adjustment member may be rotated about a center
axis of the connector such that the connected fixator rods
may be angled relative to one another in any direction
required. Similarly, the lateral adjustment may be rotated
about the center axis of the connector such that the two
fixator rods may be shifted laterally relative to one
another in any direction. The adjustable connector
provides for the adjustment of the fixator rods after the
rods have been connected to the bone pins without 
disassembling the fixator setup. Therefore, after a
surgeon has reduced and stabilized the fracture, minor
adjustments can be carried out to fully align the bone
fragments without disconnecting the fixator rods or the
bone pins. After all adjustments have been made, a series
of set screws are tightened to maintain the adjustable
connector in a fixed position.Accordingly, it is an advantage of the invention to
provide for a novel adjustable connector for a pair of
external fixator rods which provides for the angular and
lateral adjustment of the rods relative to one another.Another advantage of the invention is to provide for
an adjustable connector for a pair of fixator rods wherein
the angular adjustment mechanism may be rotated about a
longitudinal axis of the connector.Another advantage of the invention is the ability to
rotate a lateral adjustment mechanism about the
longitudinal

An adjustable connector(10)configured for connection
between a first fixator rod and a second fixator rod, the

adjustable connector (10) defining an axis and including a
lateral adjustment means (12) for laterally shifting the

fixator rods and an angular adjustment means (70) for
placing the fixator rods at an angle relative to one

another, the lateral adjustment means (12) and the angular
adjustment means (70) being connected together and defining

an axis, first clamp means (14,30) connected to the lateral
adjustment means (12) for connecting the lateral adjustment

means (12) to the first fixator rod, second clamp means
(72,90) connected to the angular adjustment means (70) for

connecting the angular adjustment means (70) to the second
fixator rod, 
characterised in that
 said first clamp means
(14,30) includes a base (14), an intermediate component

(30) and post means (38) which rotatably connects the first
clamp means (14,30) to the lateral adjustment means (12)

and allows base (14) to rotate with respect to intermediate
component (30) about the axis of the connector (10)

and the second clamp means (72,90) includes
a base (72), and intermediate component (90) and post means

(82) which rotatably connects the second clamp means
