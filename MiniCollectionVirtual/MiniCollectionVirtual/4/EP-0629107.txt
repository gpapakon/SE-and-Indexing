<ABSTRACT>
Multiple circuit functions embodied in electrical circuit lines 
and areas are supported by a multilayered printed circuit board 

of various lengths and widths (defining "x" and "y" directions) 
and of various thicknesses (defining a "z" direction) all on a 

single board. Several ways of achieving such variations in 
thickness include providing two layer subassemblies arranged in 

an alternate and intermediate manner, one subassembly being 
adapted to support electrical circuit lines and areas, and the 

other subassembly being formed of thin film dielectric material 
of various precalculated thicknesses. Another way of achieving 

a variation in thickness is to limit the surface covered by 
circuit lines with a pre-calculated core thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention, generally, relates to packaging techniques for 
printed circuit boards and, more particularly, to a technique 
for mixing various wiring technologies with various cross 
section thicknesses in the same printed circuit board. Today, it is common throughout industry to use separate printed 
circuit boards for each function to be performed within a 
particular system. This practice has developed largely due to 
cost and performance factors, since different functions require 
different cross section and wiring technologies. The practice that is common today does not permit the degree of 
flexibility in circuit construction and arrangement that cost 
and performance packaging requires. Input/Output circuits 
alone require performance considerations that lower cost 
connectors do not provide. An example of the trend that is prevalent today is to construct 
printed circuit boards of several electrically conductive 
layers with alternate layers of a dielectric material. Interconnections between layers are provided by vias that are 
coated with electrically conductive material, such as copper. It has been found that use of a multilayered structure for a 
printed circuit board provides substantial flexibility, 
particularly in supercomputer environments. Connections 
between the respective electrical circuits and components still 
must be accomplished by using conductive vias.  U.S. patent No. 3,436,819 to Lunine describes a multilayer 
laminate circuit board having various circuit configurations on 
different planes with a method of making interconnections at 
the various planes for internal operations and for contact to 
the surface of the multilayer laminate. U.S. Patent No. 3,516,156 to Steranko describes electrical 
voltage packaging technique which permits an electrical voltage 
on one or more planes buried within the package to be brought 
out to the surface of the package with a connection insulated 
from the intervening layers. U.S. patent No. 4,659,931 to Schmitz et al. discloses a 
multilayered module formed of thin film non-conductive layers 
as well as layers having conductive patterns arranged to effect
 
electrical connections between devices and to the surface of 
the module as an electrical interconnect system. U.S. patent No. 5,012,047 to Dohya describes a multilayer 
wiring substrate with signal layers on the top and bottom 
connected together and to selected internal layers by vias so 
that the external layers function as bonding pads for 
connecting leads and as lands for
