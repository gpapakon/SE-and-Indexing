<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drunkometer for
measuring alcohol concentration using a bio-sensor for
reacting with a vapor-phase alcohol gas.A drunkometric technology using a conventional bio-sensor
for measuring alcohol concentration is described
as follows.First, in the case of a gas measuring bio-sensor
using conventional electrochemical measuring methods,
living bodies such as enzymes or microbes are immobilized
in a membrane form on the surface of an electrode. The
immobilized living bodies and the electroactive material
generated by their reaction with a simple enzyme or
multistage enzymes are measured using a device such as
H2O2 electrode, oxygen electrode, NH4+-selective electrode,
ion-selective electrode field effective transistor,
thereby detecting gases.Meanwhile, the U.S.Patent No. 4,655,880 disclosed a 
bio-sensor by which various kinds of oxidase are
immobilized on a thick film amperometric electrode by
which electroactive material can be measured.However, the bio-sensor using such electrochemical
measuring methods has a drawback in that it should be
used in the favorable condition for a bio-reaction. That
is to say, such bio-sensors can detect only a liquid-phase
gas.To overcome such a drawback of the conventional bio-sensors,
a gas measuring bio-sensor which can measure a
vapor-phase organochemical material and the method
therefor are disclosed in the Korean patent application
No.93-13482.This technology is about the method for
manufacturing a bio-sensor having a structure wherein an
induced film having a hydrogel layer on which an enzyme
reacting with vapor-phase organochemical material is
immobilized, on the electrode of an amperometric device.Meanwhile, most of drunkometers are being
commercially produced using a gas sensor adopting an
oxide semiconductor, e.g., TG 822 sensor manufactured by
Figaro Inc. of Japan. Examples of the drunkometers
include an alcohol checker manufactured by Figaro Inc. of
Japan and a breath alert manufactured by Breath Alert MFG
of U.S.A.Such drunkometric technologies are to measure 
alcohol concentration contained in the gases generated
during human's exhalation in the range from 0.1mg/l to
0.8mg/l, thereby displaying a drinking degree using a
light emission diode (LED). There has been also proposed
a technology by which an alert sound is produced if a
drinking degree is higher than or equal to a
predetermined level.The ground for measuring the drinking degree depends
on an experimental report that alcohol concentration
contained in lml blood almost
