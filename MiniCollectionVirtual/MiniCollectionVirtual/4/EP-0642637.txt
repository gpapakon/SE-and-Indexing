<ABSTRACT>
A planetary gear has two driven shafts (3, 4) which turn at different speeds of rotation. The speed of rotation of the second driven shaft (4) may be reduced or increased by a second stage of the gear whose input shaft (5) acts as a regulating shaft and has an adjustable speed of rotation. The difference between the speeds of rotation of both driven shafts (3, 4) depends only on the speed of rotation of the regulating shaft (5) and not on the driving speed of rotation, so that the difference between the speeds of rotation of both driven shafts (3, 4) remains automatically constant even when the speed of rotation of the regulating shaft (5) changes, without any change in the speed of rotation of the regulating shaft (5).
