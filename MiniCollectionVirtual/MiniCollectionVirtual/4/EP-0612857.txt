<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to non-aging at room
temperature ferritic single-phase cold-rolled steel sheet
and hot-dip galvanized steel sheet for deep drawing and a
process for producing the same.The cold-rolled steel sheets and the hot-dip
galvanized steel sheets according to the present
invention are subjected to press molding before being
used in automobiles, domestic electric appliances,
buildings, etc. Since the steel sheets according to the
present invention have a combination of strength with
formability, the use thereof enables the sheet thickness
to be reduced to a greater extent than that of the
conventional steel sheets. In other words, a reduction
in weight is possible. Therefore, the steel sheets of
the present invention can be expected to contribute to
environmental protection.The production of an extra low carbon steel by a
melt process has now become easy by virtue of advances in
vacuum degassing processes for molten steels in recent
years. This has led to an ever-increasing demand for
extra low carbon steel sheets having a good
fabricability.It is well known that the extra low carbon steel
sheet of this type generally contains at least one of Ti
and Nb. Specifically, Ti and Nb interact with
interstitial solid solution elements (C, N) in the steel, 
by a strong force of attraction, to easily form
carbonitrides. Therefore, the resultant steel is a steel
free from interstitial solid solution elements (IF steel:
interstitial free steel). Since the IF steel does not
contain an interstitial solid solution element causative
of a deterioration in strain aging and formability, it
has a feature that the formability in a non-aging state
is very good. Further, addition of Ti and Nb plays an
important role in improving deep drawability of the cold-rolled
annealed steel sheet by virtue of grain refining
of a hot-rolled sheet of an extra low carbon steel the grain of which
is likely to coarsen. However, the extra low carbon
steel containing Ti and Nb has the following problems.
First, the production cost is high. Specifically, in
addition to a vacuum treatment cost for rendering the
carbon content extra low, addition of expensive Ti and Nb
is necessary. Second, since neither C nor N in a solid
solution form remains in the product sheet, fabrication
embrittlement occurs or the paint-bake hardening
disappears. Thirdly, Ti and Nb are powerful oxide
forming elements, and the formed oxides deteriorate the
surface quality.Much research and development has hitherto been
made with a view to solving the
