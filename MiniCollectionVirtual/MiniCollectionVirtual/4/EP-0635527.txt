<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing polyisocyanurate foam 
which comprises reacting an organic polyisocyanate with a 

polyol and water in the presence of a halogen-free aliphatic 
phosphoric ester having a molecular weight of 140 

to 270 and a trimerization catalyst. Polyisocyanurate 
foams having good adhesion to membrane such as paper, 

iron, aluminium, plywood and the like can be obtained 
without use of an volatile blowing agent such as CFCs, 

HCFCs and HFCs and even at low density according to the 
present process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a halogen-free trialkyl phosphate in a process for producing
a polyisocyanurate foam and, more particularly, in a
process for producing a polyisocyanurate foam suitable
for continuous production of laminate boardstock, insulation
boardstock and the like and having good adhesion to
membrane of paper, iron, aluminium, plywood and the like.Heretofore, rigid polyurethane foams and polyisocyanurate
foams have been used in a large amount as
heat insulating materials for panels, boards, chiefly
because they have low thermal conductivities and low
densities and are easy to handle. Although chlorofluorocarbons
represented by CFC-11 have been used as blowing
agents used in production of these foams, it has recently
been revealed that there is a possibility that chlorofluorocarbons
destroy the ozone layer in the stratosphere
and have bad influences on the ecological system, and it
came to be necessary to stop their use.As alternative foaming processes, there are a
process which comprises using hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs); a process which comprises utilizing
carbon dioxide formed by reaction of water and an
isocyanate; etc., but the HCFCs tend toward being controlled
in future. On the other hand, foaming by reaction
of water with an isocyanate has several problems,
one of which is that urea bond formed together with
formation of carbon dioxide lowers adhesiveness of the
resultant foam. The lowering is striking particularly in
the case of polyisocyanurate foams.Several reports were made in the past about
improvement in adhesion of polyurethane foams or polyisocyanurate
foams by usual prescription, and there can, for
example, be cited a process which comprises using
special polyol (see U. S. Patent No. 4,393,015, Japanese 
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 69118/1985, Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 166315/1985, etc.); a
process which comprises using a benzylic ether type
phenol resin, or using one together with a polyoxyethylenepropylenepolyol
(see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 208317/1983, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 213512/1988, etc.); a process which comprises
using an aromatic isocyanate and an aliphatic isocyanate
together (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
161423/1984); a process which comprises adding an ethylene
glycol (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
133034/1985); a process which comprises adding a halogen-containing
phosphoric ester (see U. S. Patent No.
5,026,737); a process which
