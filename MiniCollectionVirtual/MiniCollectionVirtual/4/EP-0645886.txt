A high energy ignition generator, particularly for 
gas turbine, of the type comprising a power source (1) 

connected to a circuit for charging energy storage means 
comprising a first storage capacitor (2) and means for 

connecting said storing means to a discharging circuit 
comprising, in series relation, energy recovering inductance 

means (4) and an ignition spark plug (5), the discharging 
circuit having terminals across which are connected free 

wheel means (6) in parallel with a resistor (7), so as to 
generate sparks between the electrodes of the spark plug, 

characterized in that the energy storage means comprise a 
second capacitor (8) connected in parallel to the terminals 

of said connecting means (3) and of at least part of the 
inductance means (4). 
Generator according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the inductance means comprise two separate inductance 

elements, connected in series relation, and in that the 
second capacitor (8) is connected to the mid point between 

the two elements. 
Generator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the connecting means comprise 

at least a semi-conductor switch unit. 
Generator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the first and second capacitors 

(2,8) are electrically equivalent.
