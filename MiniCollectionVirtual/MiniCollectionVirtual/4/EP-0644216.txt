<ABSTRACT>
A resin and a resin composition thereof which have excellent properties and afford cured products that are 
useful as electric and electronic materials and have high heat resistance, low water absorption and high adhesiveness. 

The resin is obtained by the condensation reaction between a 4,4'-di(Ï‰-substituted methyl) biphenyl and a naphthol, 
and an epoxy resin is obtained by subjecting the resin to glycidyl etherifi
cation. The resin composition comprises 
these resins and a cured product is obtained therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to resins with high refractive 
indices which are useful as sealing and laminating materials 
for electronic components; resin compositions containing 
said resins to afford cured products with high heat 
resistance, low water absorption and good adhesion; as well 
as the cured products of said resin compositions. In the field of sealing materials for electric and 
electronic components, particularly ICs, the resin 
compositions based on epoxy resins, phenolic novolak resins 
and cure accelerator have been widely used. The recent tendency toward high density and high 
integration of optical elements and ICs has demanded high 
heat resistance, low water absorption and good adhesion of 
sealing materials. Especially under rigorous conditions of 
immersion in soldering bath for high-density packaging of 
ICs, the demand for high heat resistance, low water 
absorption and good adhesion of cured products has been more  
 
and more increasing. However, the cured products of conventional 
compositions containing cresol novolak-type epoxy resins 
commonly used as epoxy resins are insufficient in heat 
resistance under rigorous conditions of immersion in 
soldering bath. As compounds affording cured products with 
heat resistance, JPA63-264622 (1988) proposes polyepoxy 
compounds obtained by epoxidation of polyphenols formed by 
condensation between phenols and aromatic aldehydes having a 
phenolic hydroxyl group. However, they are inferior to 
cresol novolak-type epoxy resins in water absorption and 
adhesion of the cured products. Phenolic novolak resins 
commonly used as hardeners are still insufficient in heat 
resistance and water absorption of the cured products. This invention provides resins which afford cured 
products with high heat resistance, low water absorption and 
good adhesion enough to endure such rigorous working 
conditions; resin compositions containing said resins; and 
the cured products thereof. As a result of elaborate studies to develop a resin 
composition having the above contradictory three properties,  
 
i.e. high heat resistance, low water absorption and good 
adhesion at the same time, the present inventors found that 
the resins of formula (I) below afford cured products with 
excellent heat resistance, water absorption and adhesion, 
and thus completed this invention. Therefore, this invention relates to: 
(1) a resin represented by formula (I): 
 
wherein A represents a hydrogen atom or a glycidyl group; B 
each independently represents a hydrogen atom,
