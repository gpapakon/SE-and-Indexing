<ABSTRACT>
An oxidized phospholipid degrading enzyme is provided, 
which plays an important role in the oxygen 

stress preventive mechanism in organisms. The enzyme 
hydrolyzes a 1-acyl-2-ω-carboxyfa
tty acid acyl-3-phosphatidylcholine 
as a substrate at the 2-ester bond 

thereof to form 1-acyl-2-lyso-3-phosphatidylcholine. 
The activity of the enzyme is slightly enhanced by 4 mM 

calcium chloride. The molecular mass of the enzyme is 
95 ± 5 kDa (by gel filtration). The enzyme is composed 

of three subunits whose molecular masses have been 
found to be 29 kDa, 30 kDa and 45 kDa, respectively, by 

SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. A gene coding the 
enzyme is also provided. This gene is important for 

the synthesis of the enzyme by genetic engineering.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel phospholipase,
and more specifically to an oxidized phospholipid
degrading enzyme playing an important role in the
oxidized phospholipid elimination mechanism in animal
cytoplasm and also to a gene coding the same.It is known that under diverse oxygen stress, a
phospholipid as a membrane-forming component is
oxidized to cause various troubles on an organism. The
organism is considered to be equipped with a protective
mechanism against such oxygen stress so that an
oxidized phospholipid formed under oxygen stress would
be promptly hydrolyzed by an oxidized phospholipid
degrading enzyme to avoid any trouble, which could
otherwise occur by a chain oxidative reaction, and also
to facilitate restoration of phospholipid molecules.Regarding the oxidized phospholipid degrading enzyme
playing the important role in the protective mechanism,
there is the view that phospholipase A2 known
to catalyze the splitting of normal phospholipids also
plays the role (Sevanian, A., Stein, R.A. and Mead, 
J.F., Lipids 16, 781-789, 1981). For the low oxidized-phospholipid
degrading activity of phospholipase A2,
however, it has been considered that another enzyme
plays this role in actual organisms.To prevent various troubles caused by oxygen
stress in an organism, it is necessary as a first step
to elucidate the protective mechanism against oxygen
stress in the organism and to identify an oxidized
phospholipid degrading enzyme which takes part in the
protective mechanism.The present inventors started research with a
view toward isolating and purifying an oxidized
phospholipid degrading enzyme which exists in a tissue
of an organism. First, it was however found that TLC
(thin-layer chromatography), which is a conventional
method for the assay of oxidized phospholipid degrading
enzymes, would be able to measure only 12 samples or so
at once and moreover, would take as long as 5 hours until
the results are obtained and hence is not usable in
view of the number of samples, deactivation of purified
enzymes, etc.An investigation was therefore conducted to
devise a new method for the assay of oxidized phospholipid 
degrading enzymes and as a method permitting assay
of 40 samples or so at once in a period as short as
2 hours or so, a method making use of 14C-labeled
oxidized phosphatidylcholine (oxidized PC) as a substrate
was developed.As a result of a further investigation, it was
found that an oxidized phospholipid degrading enzyme
also uses 1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(platelet

A method for the assay of oxidized phospholipid degrading enzymes

characterized by
 the following steps:

(a) mixing a sample with 1-hexadecyl-2-[
3
H]acetyl-
sn
-glycero-3-phosphocholine
and non-radioactive 1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-
sn
-glycero-3-phosphocholine;
(b) incubating the obtained mixture;
(c) separating acetic acid by solvent fractionation; and
(d) detecting [
3
H]-labelled acetic acid as an indication for the presence of

an oxidized phospholipid degrading enzyme.
