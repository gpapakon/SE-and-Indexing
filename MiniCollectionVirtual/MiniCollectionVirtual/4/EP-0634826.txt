<ABSTRACT>
An earth fault circuit breaker (10) for use in a circuit 
including an AC power supply and a load (11), which circuit 

breaker comprises a current-to-voltage converter (12) having 
two transformers for monitoring the current before and after 

flowing through the load, a leakage current/ voltage detector 
(13A) for processing the outputs (E1 
&
 E2) of the transformers 
to produce a resultant voltage, a voltage comparator (16) for 

comparing the said resultant voltage with a predetermined 
reference voltage to determine if there is a difference 

between the two transformer outputs, which is caused by an 
earth fault appearing at the load, and a switching driver (14) 

for disconnecting the load from the power supply in response 
to such a difference between the two transformer outputs 

exceeding the predetermined reference voltage, wherein each 
transformer has first and second primary windings (P1 
&
 P2) 
arranged to be connected to opposite sides of the load and the 

two transformers are arranged to provide outputs at their 
respective secondary windings (S), corresponding to the normal 

load current (I2), in a substantially anti-phase relationship. 
The circuit breaker (10) may optionally include another 
vo
ltage comparator (21) to detect overload current by 
monitoring the output of either one of the transformers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an earth fault circuit
breaker capable of disconnecting a load from an AC power
supply when there is an accidental earth leakage of the
load current, and optionally when there is an over-load
current.Earth fault circuit breakers for use in an AC power/load
circuit are generally known, for example as disclosed in
German Patent Application No. P 26 11 674. Such a circuit
breaker is formed by a current-to-voltage converter having
a transformer for monitoring the current before and after
flowing through the load, a leakage current/voltage
detector for processing an induced voltage of the
transformer to produce a resultant voltage, a voltage
comparator for comparing the resultant voltage with a
predetermined reference voltage and for generating a signal
indicative of a difference therebetween caused by an earth
fault appearing at the load, and a switching circuit for
disconnecting the load from the power supply in response to
such a signal.The invention seeks to provide an improved earth fault
circuit breaker.According to the invention, there is provided an earth
fault circuit breaker for use in a circuit including an AC 
power supply and a load, said circuit breaker comprising a
current-to-voltage converter having a transformer for
monitoring the current before and after flowing through the
load, a leakage current/voltage detector for processing an
induced voltage of the transformer to produce a resultant
voltage, a voltage comparator for comparing the resultant
voltage with a predetermined reference voltage and for
generating a signal indicative of a difference therebetween
caused by an earth fault appearing at the load, and a
switching circuit for disconnecting the load from the power
supply in response to such a signal, characterised in that:
the current-to-voltage converter has first and second
transformers for monitoring the current flowing into the
load and current flowing from the load, each transformer
having first and second primary windings connected to
opposite sides of the load and including a secondary
winding in which a voltage is to be induced, the first and
second transformers being arranged such that the induced
voltages of the first and second transformers are in a
substantially anti-phase relationship;the leakage current/voltage detector is arranged to
process the induced voltages of the first and second
transformers to produce a resultant voltage; andthe voltage comparator is arranged to compare the
resultant voltage with a predetermined reference
