<CLAIMS>
A radar range meter which is designed according to the FMCW principle and
which operates in the frequency range of 24,125 GHz Â± 125 MHz, 
characterised in that
 a
high-accuracy range determination is made by a step-wise determination of the optimum

frequency deviation, by making a rough determination of the range using the maximum
permissible deviation and successively reducing the deviation until an integral multiple of

the generated range gates corresponds to the exact distance from the meter to the reflecting
surface, wherein the maximum amplitude of the spectrum of the measuring sequence - or

the minimum of what are termed the secondary lines in the spectrum - serves as an
indicator for the optimum deviation, and a control loop consisting of an oscillator (1), a

directional coupler (3), a divisor chain (4), a counter (5) and of a microprocessor (6) and a
D-A converter (7) is formed with a frequency, the integral multiple of which is the actual

transmission frequency.
A radar range meter according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a video device
(16) is linked to a device for the processing of the level, with an adjustable amplifier (2)

controlled by the microprocessor (6) and a device for band-pass filtering (8).
A radar range meter according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the amplifier (2),
which is optimised for the generation of the fifth harmonic, is connected downstream of the

oscillator (1), and the band-pass filter (8) for the fifth harmonic of the oscillator frequency
and a further amplifier (9) for increasing the level and for decoupling are associated with

said amplifier.
A radar range meter according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that

the transmitted signal is separated from the received signal by a directional coupler (12).
A radar range meter according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that

the receiver comprises LO buffer amplifiers (13) and mixers (14) which are manufactured
by large-scale integrated circuit technology (monolithic microwave integrated circuit).
A radar range meter according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that

in order to convert the oscillator frequency into the MHz range the divisor chain (4) is
disposed, with a plurality of divisor stages (4a), in the control loop, which is subjected to

an auto-calibration cycle.
