<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for applying a liquid medium on a printing carrier in offset printing machines. It is suitable for processing media of different viscosity, such as low-viscosity dispersion varnishes or higher-viscosity bronze and decorative printing inks. In order to guarantee precise metering, two function modules are arranged in an exchangeable manner on a forme cylinder (2) in two bearings (21, 7). If it is necessary to process low-viscosity media, the first function module, consisting at least of a metering roller (4) and applicator roller (3), is used. For processing higher-viscosity media, the second function module, consisting at least of a screened applicator roller (3') and a chamber-type doctor (5), is used.

<CLAIMS>
Method for applying a liquid medium to material to 
be printed in offset printing presses using an 

impression cylinder, a forme cylinder and an 
applicator roller, characterised in that for 

metering the medium, the pressure adjustment of a 

metering roll or of a chamber doctor relative to an 
applicator roll takes place via the same eccentric 

bearing. 
Device for carrying out the process according to 
Claim 1, characterised in that the device contains a 

first functional module, a second functional module 
and eccentric adjustable bearings (7) and roller 

bearings (21) which are arranged in side frames (19) 
of the offset printing press wherein exchangeably 

arrangeable relative to the forme cylinder (2) in 
the same eccentric bearings (7, 21) is the first 

functional module (3, 4) for working with low 
viscosity media or the second functional module for 

working with higher viscosity media. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the first functional module consists of at least an 

applicator roller (3) and a metering roller (4) and 
the second functional module is constructed of at 

least a textured applicator roller (3') and a 
chamber doctor (5). 
Device for carrying out the process according to 
Claim 3, characterised in that the first functional 

module (3, 4) 

is formed by the metering roller (4) constructed 
in steel and the applicator roller (3) with a rubber 

coating, wherein the forme cylinder (2) carries a 
blanket or  

 
the metering roller (4) is formed with a rubber 
cover and the applicator roller (3) constructed in 

steel, wherein the forme cylinder (2) carries a 
flexoprinting plate. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the first functional module is constructed of a 

metering roller (4) arranged rotatably in an 
adjustable bearing (7), an applicator roller (3) 

arranged rotatably in the roller bearing (21), as 
well as a feed device arranged above the roller nip 

(11) and the second functional module consists of a 
textured applicator roller (3') rotatably arranged 

in the roller bearing (21) as well as a chamber 
doctor (5) rotatably arranged in the adjustable 

bearing (7) and a swivel bearing (6). 
Device according to Claim 3 to 5, characterised in 
that as a component of the second functional module, 

the chamber doctor (5) is releasably fixed to a 
frame (15) which, by means of cross-member (12) is 

rotatably received in swivel bearings (6) and is 
received rotatably in adjustable bearings (7) in 

each case via a pivot (10) by means of a link (9). 
Device according to Claim 3 to 6, characterised in 
that the chamber doctor (5) has a working doctor 

leaf (16) set negatively to the applicator roller 
(3), the point of application (18) of which lies on 

the line (23) running through the centre of the 
bearing (22) of the roller bearing (21) which is 

preferably a horizontal. 
Offset printing press with a device according to 
Claim 2 to 6 wherein the device is arranged prior to 

the printing units.  
 
Offset printing press with a device according to 
Claim 2 to 7 wherein the device is arranged between 

the printing units. 
Offset printing press with a device according to 
Claim 2 to 7 wherein the device is arranged 

subsequent to the printing units. 
Offset printing press according to Claim 8 to 10 
wherein a further processing device is arranged 

before or after the device.
