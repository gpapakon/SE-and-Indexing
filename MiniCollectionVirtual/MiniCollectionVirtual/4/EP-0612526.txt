<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antiphlogistic-analgesic 
plaster comprising piroxicam as an active 
ingredient, and more particularly to an antiphlogistic-analgesic 
plaster improved percutaneous absorption of 
piroxicam contained therein. Piroxicam is a compound called by a chemical name of 
4-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)-2H-1,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxamide-1,1-dioxide 
and has an excellent antiphlogistic 
and analgesic effect. It has hence been widely used 
clinically at present. Piroxicam is mostly prepared in the form of an oral 
preparation and in the forms of a suppository and an 
ointment in extreme part. However, the oral preparation has involved a problem 
of side effects such as a disorder of the digestive tract. 
Although the side effects are somewhat reduced by the 
suppository compared with the oral preparation, the disorder 
of the digestive tract has been still recognized on the 
suppository. Moreover, these preparations have been 
difficult to effectively deliver their active ingredients to  
 
the diseased area. The ointment by which piroxicam can be 
topically applied has been proposed in order to remedy the 
above drawbacks involved in the oral preparation and 
suppository. However, this preparation has also been 
accompanied by drawbacks that its dose is inaccurate and its 
base ingredients adhere to clothes to smear them. A plaster is the most effective form for percutaneously 
administering the drug to deliver it to the diseased area 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No 316314/1989 
discloses that a plaster in which lornoxicam, tenoxicam, 
piroxicam or sulindac is incorporated exhibit higher 
antiphlogistic and analgesic effect compared with a plaster 
in which a non-steroidal antiphlogistic-analgesic drug such 
as indomethacin, diclofenac, flurbiprofen or ketoprofen is 
incorporated. However, its effect is insufficient and it also 
offers a problem of physical properties as a plaster. 
Therefore, it is unfit for use and hence not yet provided in 
the clinical field under circumstances. As described above, a satisfactory effect has not been 
successfully achieved even when piroxicam has been 
incorporated into a base for a plaster because its percutaneous 
absorption is poor. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a piroxicam-containing plaster excellent in percutaneous 
absorption of piroxicam. In view of the foregoing circumstances, the present  
 
inventors have carried out an extensive investigation. As a 
result, it has been found that
