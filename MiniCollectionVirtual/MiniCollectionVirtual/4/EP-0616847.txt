<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid acid 
catalyst for paraffin conversion which is used in 
petroleum refining and petrochemical industries and a 
process for paraffin conversion using catalyst thereof. In petroleum refining and petrochemical 
industries, conversion reactions participating in a 
large number of paraffins have been carried out. The 
example includes catalytic cracking, catalytic 
reforming, hydrocracking, isomerization, alkylation, 
etc. Particularly, as a catalyst for conversion 
carrying out paraffin isomerization reaction and 
paraffin alkylation reaction, etc., an acid catalyst 
having strong acidity is required. Hitherto, for these 
reactions, acid catalysts such as sulfuric acid, 
hydrogen fluoride, aluminum chloride and antimony 
trichloride have been used. However, since these 
catalysts cause metal corrosion, use of expensive 
materials having corrosion resistance and treatment for  
 
anti-corrosion are required. Moreover, with recent 
tightening of environmental regulations, disposal of 
waste catalysts requires a high cost and tends to 
severely be regulated. Furthermore, there has been the 
problem that these catalysts are difficult to separate 
from the reactants. Moreover, in paraffin isomerization, there has 
been applied a process which comprises carrying out 
isomerization in the presence of a catalyst treated a 
solid acid supported a noble metal including Pt with a 
compound containing a halogen, and hydrogen. However, 
since the catalyst is very readily deactivated with 
water, there has been the problem that a higher cost is 
required for removal of water in a starting material. JP-A-5-58921 discloses a process for producing 
a butyl group-substituted aromatic compound which 
comprises reacting ethylene with an aromatic compound 
in the presence of a catalyst containing an alkali metal 
salt of heteropoly acid and a metal of Group VIII. 
However, JP-A-5-58921 disclose no paraffin conversion. EP-A-0 363 202 and EP-A-0 466 471 disclose alkane oxidation 
which occurs in the presence of a catalyst, the catalyst being a 
heteropoly acid comprising a group VIII metal. The object of the present invention is to 
solve the above-mentioned prior problems and provide a 
solid acid catalyst for paraffin conversion which causes  
 
no corrosion and is readily separated from reactants and 
furthermore has high activity for an acid catalyst 
reaction. As a result of an extensive study to solve the 
above-mentioned problems, the present inventors have 
found that a catalyst
