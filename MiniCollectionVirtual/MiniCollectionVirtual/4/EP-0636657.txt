<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a polymer mixture comprising a polyphenylene 
ether, a polyarylene sulphide and an agent to improve the homogeneity as used 
for polyphenylene ether-polyamide polymer mixtures. Such polymer mixtures 
are described in various patent publications:
 
US-A-4,021,596; JP-A-55/129422 (see WPI Acc. No. 
80-83415 C/47); JP-A-62/065351 (see WPI Acc. No. 
80-120241/17); JP-A-55/135160 (see WPI Acc. No. 
80-87164C/49); JP-A-50/156,561 (see CA, Vol. 84, 1976, 
page 35, No. 84 : 106514 v). Polymer mixtures comprising a polyphenylene ether and a polyarylene 
sulphide have a combination of properties which each of the individual 
components does not have, for example, a combination of certain mechanical 
properties, a good resistance against organic solvents, a better processability 
and flame-retarding properties. In accordance with the desired combination of 
properties, the two polymers were used in a variety of mixing natios. The disadvantage of the known polymer mixtures is that the two 
polymers do not form a homogeneous mixture. Products manufactured, for 
example, from these polymer mixtures by injection moulding, show a tendency 
of delamination. This often leads to a surface having pearl gloss. It also often 
appears that the addition of further additives, for example, agents to improve 
the impact strength, to non-homogeneous polymer mixtures, only results in a 
small improvement of the properties. The invention provides polymer mixtures which have a beter 
homogeneity. The invention is based on the discovery that certein reaction products of 
polyphenylene ether as defined in the claims are suitable to improve the 
homogeneity of the polymer mixtures according to the invention.  The polymer mixture according to the invention is characterised in that it 
comprises the polymer mixture comprises as an agent to improve the 
homogeneity a functionalised polyphenylene ether consisting of the reaction 
product of (a) a polyphenylene ether and (b) a compound of the general formula 
(i)-Z-(ii), wherein (i) is at least a group of the formula [X-C(0)] with X = F, Cl, 
Br, I, OH,-OR, or -0-C(0)-R with R = H, alkyl or aryl, wherein (ii) is at least a 
carboxylic acid, acid anhydride, acid amide, imido, carboxylic acid ester, 
amino, expoxy or hydroxyl group, and wherein the groups (i) and (ii) are 
bonded together covalently via a bridge Z, Z being a bivalent hydrocarbon 
radical or the reaction product of a) a 1,2-substituted olefinic compound with 
carboxyl group or acid anhydride group, b) a
