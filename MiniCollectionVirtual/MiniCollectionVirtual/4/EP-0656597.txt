<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a contact frame for an electronic card, the said contact frame exhibiting a first and a second row of electrical contact elements (70) exhibiting a face (75) for contact with the card and defining pairs of contact elements situated opposite one another and also comprising a first and a second detection contact blade. The first (80) and the second (90) detection contact blades are arranged respectively on the first and second rows, opposite one another, at least the first contact blade (80) having a length greater than that of the contact elements so that, when the card is set in place relative to the contact frame, the first (80) and the second (90) contact blades come into electrical contact.

Contact frame for a connector for electronics 
cards, the said contact frame having a first and second 

row of electrical contact elements having a face for 
contact with the card and defining pairs of contact 

elements located opposite each other and also comprising 
a first and second detection contact blade, characterized 

in that the first (80) and second (90) detection contact 
blades are arranged respectively on the first and second 

rows, opposite each other, at least the first contact 
blade (80) being longer than the contact elements, this 

blade being extended until it at least partially covers 
the end of the blade located opposite, so that when the 

card is put in place relative to the contact frame the 
first (80) and second (90) contact blades come into 

electrical contact. 
Contact frame according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the first blade (80) has a crook-shaped distal 

end (85) the concavity of which is turned towards the 
contact-face side (72) of the electrical contact elements 

(70). 
Contact frame according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the said crook-shaped distal end (85) has a 

crook-shaped extension (89), the concavity of which is 
turned towards the side of the electrical contact 

elements (70) opposite the contact face (72). 
Contact frame according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the second contact blade (90) has a paddle-shaped 

distal end (95), the said extension (89) of the first 
blade (80) coming to overlap at least a part of the 
said  
 

paddle-shaped distal end (95). 
Contact frame according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it includes a linking 

element (83) connecting at least one contact blade 
(80,90) to an adjacent contact element (70). 
Contact frame according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the said crook-shaped distal end (85) has an apex 

(82) extending beyond one edge of the contact frame by a 
height (h') less than the height (h) by which an apex 

(72) of the contact elements (70) extends beyond the said 
edge (20") 
Contact frame according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the said crook-shaped distal end has an apex (82) 

extending beyond one edge of the contact frame by a 
height (h") greater than the height (h) by which an apex 

(72) of the contact elements (70) extends beyond the said 
edge (20"). 
Connector for electronics cards, characterized in 
that it includes a contact frame according to one of the 

preceding claims. 
Connector according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that it includes a cover which comprises a housing for 

the card and which is articulated with respect to the 
contact frame. 
Connector according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that it includes a card guide which is profiled so as to 

press the card towards the contact frame and insert the 
card towards the contact frame and insert the contact 

elements and at least the first blade (80) in the vicinity 
of an end-of-travel position of the card.
