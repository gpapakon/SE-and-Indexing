<ABSTRACT>
A joystick controller has a body (12) including an end wall (18) in which is secured a resilient arm (10). The resilient arm (10) has secured to its top a tube (90) and a handle (94). The tube (90) surrounds the arm and mounts an annular magnet (38) at the level of a pivot point (96) about which the arm (10) flexes. The outputs of Hall effect probes (26) are affected by the position of the magnet (38) to give an indication of the position of the arm (10). The angular position of a rotary handle (80) is sensed using a magnet (110) which is connected for movement with the handle (80) relative to further Hall effect probes (116).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a joystick controller of the type including a 
control arm to which an external force is applied, and measurements of 
the movement of the control arm in response to the applied force are 
used to control other apparatus. In some joystick controllers, a rigid control arm is pivotally mounted 
upon a body and biased towards a centre position by a spring or springs. 
When a force is applied to the control arm, the spring(s) allow(s) the 
control arm to pivot with respect to the body. The position of the 
control arm is determined using the output of switches, potentiometers or 
other sensors which are positioned around the control arm. When the 
force is removed, the control arm returns to its original position under 
the action of the spring(s). In other joystick controllers, a rigid control arm, having at its top a knob 
which is held between the fingers, is mounted on a base. A number of 
strain gauge elements are positioned around the control arm and 
arranged to measure any strain applied to the control arm. The control 
arm is rigidly attached to the base and scarcely flexes or moves with 
respect to the base when a force is applied to the control arm (the 
maximum amount of permitted movement at the knob is typically as 
little as 0.05 mm, and therefore the arm essentially feels rigid). These 
types of controller lack "feel" and it is therefore difficult to exercise the 
required control accurately. Furthermore, it is difficult to ensure that the 
output of the controller corresponding to the centre position is consistent 
every time that the external force is removed. Each of the documents EP-A-0 151 479 and EP-A-0 447 334 discloses a joystick controller comprising 
a flexible control arm which is rigidly attached to a base. Sensors are attached to the control 
arm for measuring the stress (flexure) in the arm when a force is applied to the joystick 
handle. US-A-4 459 578 discloses a joystick controller comprising a control arm which is pivotally 
mounted to a base. Movement of the arm is detected by use of Hall effect elements and magnets.  
 According to the present invention there is provided a joystick controller 
comprising a resilient control arm rigidly connected to a support and 
said resilient control arm being 
arranged to flex under the action of an applied force, and at least one 
sensor for measuring the flexure of the control arm, characterized in that 
at least one sensor includes a sensor member which is mounted for 
movement with the control arm on a

<CLAIMS>
A joystick controller comprising a resilient control arm (10) 
rigidly connected to a support (12) and said resilient control arm being arranged to flex under the action 

of an applied force, and at least one sensor (38,26) for measuring the 
flexure of the control arm (10), characterized in that said at least one 

sensor includes a sensor member (38) mounted for movement with the 
control arm (10) on a tube (90) which tube is secured to the control arm (10) 

at or near to a part of the latter which is held in use. 
A joystick controller as claimed in claim 1, wherein said sensor 
member (38) is arranged to tilt about a point (96) intermediate the ends 

of the control arm (10) when the control arm (10) is flexed. 
A joystick controller as claimed in claim 2, wherein the point 
(96) is located within the volume of the sensor member (38). 
A joystick controller as claimed in claim 3, wherein the point 

(96) is located substantially at the centre of the sensor member (38). 
A joystick controller as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
means (24, 25) are provided for limiting flexing movement of said 

resilient control arm (10) about said point (96). 
A joystick controller as claimed in claim 5, wherein said means 
(24, 25) comprises a tapered wall (24) of a body member (25) relative to 

which the resilient control arm (10) can flex. 
A joystick controller as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein  
 

said at least one sensor comprises a magnet (38) and a sensor element 
(26) responsive to a magnetic field. 
A joystick controller as claimed in claim 7, whereon the sensor 
element (26) operates using the Hall effect principle. 
A joystick controller as claimed in claim 7 or 8, wherein single 
magnet (38) is used with a plurality of sensor elements (26) to form a 

plurality of sensors. 
A joystick controller as claimed in claim 9, wherein there are 
four sensor elements (26) spaced substantially equally around the control 

arm (10), opposing sensor elements (26) being grouped together to 
measure flexure along an axis. 
A joystick controller as claimed in any preceding claim, further 
including at least one manually operable member (80) which is movable 

independently of the control arm (10), and at least one further sensor 
(110,116) for measuring movement of said at least one member (80) 

whereby at least one additional parameter can be controlled by the 
controller.
