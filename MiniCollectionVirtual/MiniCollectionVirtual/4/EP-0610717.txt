<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refer to a washing machine, specifically a 
laundry washing machine. It is conventional practice to fasten a motor to the body 
of a laundry machine having both motor caps provided with 
supports on which rubber pads are assembled to absorb the 
vibrations caused by motor during operation; thereafter, 
spacers will be inserted into the rubber pads to avoid 
excessive compression when tightening the bolts to fasten 
the motor to the machine (generally to the tub). Subsequently the transmission belt is assembled and as a 
final step belt tension adjusted by positioning the motor 
correctly, generally using proper slot in the supports. From DE-A-4 026 549 a washing machine is known, where the 
motor is sustained by a transmission belt and comprises a 
rigid guide, which is inserted is a proper seat integral 
with an appendix of the rear cross member of the washing 
tub. In this solution, however, vibration and mechanical 
stresses between the two elements occur, with consequent 
noise during the machine operation; furthermore, the cited 
appendix involves a complication in the manufacturing step 
and reduces the available space within the machine cabinet. From FR-A-2 201 366 a washing machine is also known where 
the motor is pivoted at both sides to two supports, being 
integral with the tub; a spring must be provided, opposing 
its elastic force to the belt, with the purpose of 
guaranteeing the belt tension. This solution presents the 
disadvantage of employing a highly precompressed spring, 
that complicates to a high extent the motor assembly and 
disassembly operations, and it is dangerous by itself. Furthermore, this solution involves a high amount of  
 
vibrations being transmitted to the washing tub. Purpose of the invention is to provide a washing machine, 
specifically a laundry washer, allowing an easier and 
faster motor assembly, thus reducing the number of parts 
required and of operations to be carried out. Starting from FR-A-2 201 366 these aims are attained by a washing machine and a method 
for the motor assembly having the characterizing features 
of the annexed claims 1 and 9. The features and advantages of the machine according to the 
invention are detailed in the following description with 
reference to the annexed drawings, which are supplied only 
by way of non limiting example, where: 
Fig. 1 shows a schematic front view (A) and a side view 
(B) of the motor for a laundry washer according to the 
invention; Fig. 2 shows a schematic front view (A) and a side view

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Washing machine, specifically a laundry washing 
machine, comprising a tub and an electric motor (1), said 

motor (1) being coupled to support means (12) integral with 
a tub wall (10) and sustained in its front part by a 

transmission belt (15) extending from the motor (1) to a 
sheave, whereby rest means (6) are provided between the tub 

wall (10) and the motor (1) opposing the tension of the 
belt (15), characterized in that, in order to allow the 

assembly/disassembly of the motor (1) to the tub without 
the use of screw, rivets or other equivalent fastening 

means, or the use of tools: 

said transmission belt (15) is of the flexible type, 
being able to balance small deviations from its nominal 

value, 
said motor (1) is hooked only in its rear portion to said 
support means (12), 
in the contact points between said rest means (6) and the 
tub wall (10) first rubber pads (7) are provided, for 

absorbing operating vibrations and keeping the sheave 
motor axle distance within a range which ensure the 

motion transmission by the belt. 
Washing machine, according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said support means integral with the 

tub (10) accommodates a second rubber pad (4), onto which 
said motor (1) is hooked. 
Washing machine, according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the rear cap (2) of the motor (1) 

comprises a hook shaped element (3). 
Washing machine, according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said rest means (6) are integral with 

the front cap (5) of the motor (1) and define a seat for  
 

containing the lower section of said first rubber pads (7). 
Washing machine, according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that resting seats (11) are defined by 

said tub (10), for containing the upper section of said 
first rubber pads (7). 
Washing machine, according to at least one of the 
previous claims, characterized in that said resting seats 

(11) and/or said support means (12) are obtained by the 
moulding of a tub (10) realized in plastic material. 
Washing machine, according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the hooking system (3,12) between the 

motor (1) and the support means (12) is shaped for allowing 
a constrained rotation of said motor (1) around said 

support means (12). 
Washing machine, according to at least one of the 
previous claims, characterized in that said hook element 

(3) and/or said support means (12) are shaped for 
supporting the motor even in case of break of the 

transmission belt (15). 
Method for the assembly of an electric motor (1) to 
the tub (10) of a laundry washing machine without the use 

of screw, rivets or other equivalent fastening means, or 
the use of tools, whereby the motor (1) has to be coupled 

with support means (12) being integral with said tub (10) 
and sustained in its front part by a transmission belt 

(15), rest means (6) being arranged between the tub (10) 
and the motor (1) opposing the tension of the belt (15), 

characterized in that the following steps are provided: 

an hooking element (3) integral with the rear part of the 
motor (1) is aligned with a support means (12) integral
