<DESCRIPTION>
PEPTIDYL DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS METALLOPROTEINASE INHIBITORSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a novel class of peptidyl derivatives, to processes for their preparation and to their use in medicine.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION In normal tissues, cellular connective tissue synthesis is offset by extracellular matrix degradation, the two opposing effects existing in dynamic equilibrium. Degradation of the matrix is brought about by the action of proteinases released from resident connective tissue cells and invading inflammatory cells, and is due, in part, to the activity of at least three groups of metalloproteinases. These are the collagenases, the gelatinases (or type-IV collagenases) and the stromelysins. Normally these catabolic enzymes are tightly regulated at the level of their synthesis and secretion and also at the level of their extracellular activity, the latter through the action of specific inhibitors, such as α - macroglobulins and TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase), which form inactive complexes with metalloproteinases.The accelerated, uncontrolled breakdown of connective tissues by metalloproteinase catalysed resorption of the extracellular matrix is a feature of many pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, corneal, epidermal or gastric ulceration; tumour metastasis or invasion; periodontal disease and bone disease. It can be expected that the pathogenesis of such diseases is likely to be modified in a beneficial manner by the administration of metalloproteinase inhibitors and numerous compounds have been suggested for this purpose [for a general review see Wahl, R.C. si a! Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 25, 175-184, Academic Press Inc., San Diego (1990)].Although numerous metalloproteinase inhibitors have been described, many have not been suitable for further development as medicines since they have lacked any useful activity when administered orally at 

pharmaceutically acceptable doses. What is therefore needed is a potent orally active compound with a good duration of action.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have now found a new class of peptidyl derivatives, members of which are metalloproteinase inhibitors. The compounds according to the invention have surprisingly good oral bioavailability, and after oral administration have an advantageously longer duration of action than related known compounds, such as those described in International Patent Specification No. WO92/09564.Thus according to one aspect of the invention we provide a compound of formula
