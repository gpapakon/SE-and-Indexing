<ABSTRACT>
A user interface simplifies operation of a intelligent facsimile machine 
(IFAX). A display screen displays a plurality of menus and allows the user to select 

from the menus. The IFAX can store a plurality of digital cover pages to minimize 
transmission time for a facsimile cover page. The user may select from a list of stored 

digital cover pages. The user may also attach a binary data file to a facsimile message 
and transfer the data to another facsimile machine. The IFAX uses a storage location 

for storing outgoing facsimile messages. The IFAX periodically check the storage 
location to determine if more than one facsimile message is to be transmitted to the 

same location and transmits the facsimile messages in one facsimile telephone call. If 
the IFAX is coupled to a second IFAX on a network, the two IFAX machines can 

balance the work load by sending a load transfer request if the number of outgoing 
facsimile messages exceeds a predetermined threshold level. The IFAX can also route 

incoming facsimile messages to a variety of destinations such as a floppy disk or other 
storage device, or an external computer. The IFAX can also relay incoming facsimile 

messages to another facsimile machine, using a set or relay instructions. The relay 
instructions may be stored in the IFAX or may be a portion of the incoming facsimile 

message. The relay instructions may be nested, and the IFAX sends the facsimile 
message to a second IFAX with instructions for the second IFAX to relay the 

facsimile message to a third facsimile machine. The IFAX contains security measures 
to prevent unauthorized relaying.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates generally to a user interface for an 
intelligent facsimile machine (IFAX) and, more specifically, to a system and 
method for controlling user interaction with the IFAX. The modern workplace has become increasingly dependent on 
electronic devices. Machines such as photocopiers, computers, modems, and 
facsimiles are now considered essential tools for the office. Many of these tools 
are extremely sophisticated, which can make them difficult to use. The increased 
capability of these tools has often outpaced the ability of the average user to 
efficiently operate them. For example, an old style facsimile (FAX) machine had few 
options and was relatively easy to operate. Early FAX machines used an 
acoustical modem to couple the FAX signal to a standard telephone handset. 
The person sending a facsimile message simply dialed the FAX telephone 
number of the recipient and plugged the telephone handset into the acoustical 
modem when they heard an audible tone generated by the recipient's FAX 
machine over the handset. The FAX machine was easy to use, but had few or no 
options. More modern IFAX machines have direct telephone lines as well 
as a long list of sophisticated options. For example, the user can elect to send a 
facsimile message immediately, or delay transmission to a later time at which it 
is automatically sent, such as at nighttime when the telephone rates decrease. 
The facsimile message is read by the IFAX and a digital image of the message is 
stored in memory within the IFAX until the designated transmission time. With another option, the user may elect to send a facsimile 
message to a group of recipients that can be specified by a group identifier. The 
IFAX stores a list of facsimile telephone numbers, sometimes called addresses, 
and can be programmed to recognize various groups. The user need only 
provide the IFAX with the instruction to send a facsimile message to a group, 
such as "Sales Managers", for example, and the IFAX will automatically send  
 
the facsimile message to each facsimile telephone number associated with the 
group of sales managers. Numerous other features such as speed dialing, automatic 
redialing, confidential facsimile transmission and reception, facsimile 
forwarding, facsimile relaying and facsimile polling are now available on 
modern IFAXs. One problem with the advanced technological features of the 
modem IFAX is that they are difficult for the average user utilize without 
extensive training. Further, once learned, if a new
