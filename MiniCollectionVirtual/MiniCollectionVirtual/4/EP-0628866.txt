<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide color 
photographic light-sensitive material, and more particularly 
to a silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material 
having excellent color forming characteristics, capable of 
forming an image excellent in the permanency, and improved so 
as to be free of color fog. In the silver halide color photographic light-sensitive 
material, as the dye image forming agents therefor, yellow, 
magenta and cyan couplers are usually used in combination. 
These couplers are required to have basic performance characteristics 
such as color-forming characteristics, storage stability, 
resulting image's color reproduction quality, and image 
keeping quality. Particularly, in the color photographic light-sensitive 
material to be provided for direct appreciation, such  
 
as color photographic paper, since importance is attached to 
white background, it is required for the paper to inhibit color 
stain such as color fog to the utmost. In order to inhibit the color fog, an antistain agent such 
as a hydroquinon derivative is used. The oxidation product of 
a developing agent that has been produced for some reason in 
an unexposed area of the light-sensitive material, before 
coming into its coupling reaction with a coupler, is subjected 
to scavenge treatment with the antistain agent, whereby the 
occurrence of color fog can be inhibited. As is predicted from 
such the mechanism, if the antistain agent is used in plenty, 
it would impair the color-forming characteristics of the coupler, 
bringing about problems of the maximum density drop and 
contrast reduction. The excessive use of the antistain agent 
causes a problem of deteriorating the dye image's resistance 
to light as described in Japanese Patent Publication Open to 
Public Inspection (hereinafter abbreviated to JP O.P.I.) No. 
275261/1987. Thus, an attempt made to efficiently prevent the 
occurrence of color fog is forced into dilemma by causing at 
the same time the lowering of the maximum density and deterioration 
of the resistance to light. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a 
silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material which 
is efficiently improved to be free of color fog to provide an  
 
excellent color image finish without lowering its maximum density 
or deteriorating its image keeping quality. The silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material 
of the invention comprises a support having thereon a 
plurality of silver halide emulsion layers,
