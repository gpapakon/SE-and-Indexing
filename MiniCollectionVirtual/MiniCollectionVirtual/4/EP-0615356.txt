<ABSTRACT>
A technique for reducing nonlinear signal degradation and fading over optical 
transmission systems by simultaneously launching two optical signals of different wavelengths 

and substantially orthogonal relative polarizations, into the same transmission path. The 
launched signals, which are collected at the receiving end of the transmission path, have equal 

optical power levels, and are modulated to carry identical information. Since the two signals 
are launched into the transmission path with substantially orthogonal polarizations and 

comparable power levels, the overall transmitted signal is essentially unpolarized. As a result, 
the impact of any detrimental polarization dependent effects within the transmission system 

are minimized. In addition, since the launched signals are combined at the receiving end of 
the transmission path, the power level of each individual signal can be reduced, thereby 

diminishing the impact of those nonlinear effects which increase as a function of power level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the optical transmission of information and, more 
particularly, to improving transmission capabilities over very long optical transmission paths. Very long optical fiber transmission paths, such as those employed in undersea 
or transcontinental terrestrial lightwave transmission systems which employ optical amplifier 
repeaters, are subject to decreased performance due to nonlinearities in the transmission fibers. 
In addition, these systems are susceptible to signal fading and/or fluctuations in the 
signal-to-noise ratio ("SNR") which are primarily caused by polarization dependent effects. Fiber nonlinearities can degrade SNR by enhancing optical noise, or by causing 
distortion in the transmitted optical waveform. These nonlinear interactions increase as a 
function of the optical power level, and are dependent upon the relative state of polarization 
("SOP") between the signals and the noise. If optical fibers offered a truly linear transmission 
medium, system performance (as measured by SNR) would improve as optical power was 
increased. However, the slight nonlinearity of optical fibers places an upper bound upon the 
level of optical power that can be transmitted -- thereby limiting the performance of any 
transmission system employing the fibers. In long optical transmission systems employing amplifiers, the SNR can 
fluctuate in a random manner. This fluctuation contributes to a phenomenon known as signal 
fading. Signal fading results in an increased bit error rate ("BER") for digital signals 
transmitted via the optical fiber path. When the SNR of a digital signal within such a 
transmission system becomes unacceptably small (resulting in an undesirably high BER), a 
signal fade is said to have occurred. Experimental evidence has shown that signal fading, and 
the underlying SNR fluctuations, are caused by a number of polarization dependent effects 
induced by the optical fiber itself and/or other optical components (e.g., repeaters, amplifiers, 
etc.) along the transmission path. In particular, polarization dependent BER over long optical 
fiber paths can be attributed to polarization dependent loss ("PDL"), polarization dependent 
gain ("PDG"), polarization mode dispersion ("PMD"), and polarization dependent hole-burning  
 
("PDHB"). All of these effects impact signal transmission as a function of the particular SOP 
of an optical signal being propagated along the path. Naturally, the SOP of a signal launched into a particular optical transmission 
path can be
