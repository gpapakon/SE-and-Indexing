 Novel Cephalosporin CompoundsField of the InventionThe present invention relates to new cephalosporin compounds of the formula (I), particularly 3-position of cephem rings substituted with new thione compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which have broad antibacterial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Summary of the InventionAn objective of the present invention is to provide new antibiotic cephalosporin compounds of the forraula(I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof(1)whereinRi is a Cι-4 alkyl (preferably methyl or ethyl), C3-4 alkenyl(preferably allyl), C3-4 alkynyl (preferably propargyl) group or -C(Ra)(Rb)C02H(preferably -C(CH3)2C02H or -CH2CO2H), wherein Ra and Rb, same or different, are a 

 atom or a Cι-4 alkyl group;R2 is a C1-4 alkyl (preferably methyl or ethyl), C3-4 alkenyl (preferably allyl),C3-4 cycloalkyl (preferably cyclopropyl)group or carboxyalkyl (preferably -CH2CO2H)group;R3 is a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic compounds-containing 1 or- 2 nitrogen atom(s)(preferably piperazine, alkylpiperazine-substituted with C1-4 alkyl at N- or2-position of piperazine, imidazole-substituted or unsubstituted with C1-4 alkyl);R4 is hydrogen or a carboxylic acid. 

Detailed Description of the InventionThe compounds of the formula(I) can be prepared by reacting the compounds of the formular(II) with the new thione compounds of the foπnular (III), as follows:wherein (I)Ri is a methyl, allyl, propargyl group or -C(CH3)2C02H; R2.R3 and R4 are the same as defined above.In the preparation of the objective compounds(I), the compounds of the formula(III) are used preferably in an amount of from 1 to 2 equivalent(s) based on 1 equivalent of the compounds of the formula(II).The reaction for introducing the compounds(III) into the 3-poεition of corapound(II) to prepare compounds(I) is carried out in the presence of a solvent such as water, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, or a mixed agueous solvent of water. An appropriate water-miscible solvent is acetonitrile or acetone.Also, the reaction may be carried out at 40°C to 100°C, preferably 60°C to 80*C. To stabilize reaction products and their intermediate;;, one or more salts selected from the group consisting of sodium iodide and potassiua iodide can be used as stabilizing agents.On the other hand, the separation and purification of the compoundsd) can be carried out using a known method such as recrystallization, column chromatography over silica gel or ion-exchange chromatography.The new
