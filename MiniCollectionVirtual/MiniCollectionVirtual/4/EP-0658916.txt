<ABSTRACT>
An image display apparatus comprises a 
plurality of electron-emitting devices and an image-forming 

member for forming an image upon irradiation of 
electron beams emitted from the electron-emitting 

devices. The apparatus further comprises a plurality 
of substrates having the electron-emitting devices 

arrayed thereon and being arranged side by side, and a 
deviating unit for deviating the electron beams emitted 

from the electron-emitting devices arrayed on the 
substrates. The deviating unit deviates the electron 

beams toward the boundary between the substrates. When 
the plurality of substrates are combined with each 

other to provide the image forming apparatus having a 
large-sized screen, a display incapable region is 

prevented from appearing at the boundary between the 
substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a planar
display apparatus having a large-sized screen, and more
particularly to a display apparatus newly designed to
increase the screen size of a planar CRT which employs
electron-emitting devices and fluorescent substances.Heretofore, two types of electron-emitting
devices are known; i.e., a thermionic cathode device
and a cold cathode device. Cold cathode devices
include electron-emitting devices of surface conduction
type, field emission type (hereinafter abbreviated to
FE), metal/insulating layer/metal type (hereinafter
abbreviated to MIM), etc.One example described in, e.g., M.I. Elinson,
Radio Eng. Electron Phys., 10, 1290, (1965) and other
later-described examples are known as surface
conduction electron-emitting devices.A surface conduction electron-emitting device
utilizes a phenomenon that when a thin film having a
small area is formed on a substrate and a current is
supplied to flow parallel to the film surface,
electrons are emitted therefrom. As to such a surface
conduction electron-emitting device, there have been 
reported, for example, one using a thin film of SnO2 by
Elinson cited above, one using an Au thin film [G.
Dittmer: "Thin Solid Films", 9, 317 (1972)], one using
a thin film of In2O3/SnO2 [M. Hartwell and C.G. Fonstad:
"IEEE Trans. ED Conf.", 519 (1975)], and one using a
carbon thin film [Hisashi Araki et. al.: "Vacuum", Vol.
26, No. 1, 22 (1983)].As a typical configuration of those surface
conduction electron-emitting devices, Fig. 31 shows a
plan of the device proposed by M. Hartwell in the
above-cited paper. In Fig. 31, denoted by reference
numeral 3001 is a substrate and 3004 is a conductive
thin film made of a metal oxide formed by sputtering.
As shown, the conductive thin film 3004 is formed into
an H-shaped pattern in plan view. The conductive thin
film 3004 is subjected to the energizing process called
forming by energization (described later) to form an
electron-emitting region 3005. The dimensions
indicated by L and W in the drawing are set to
0.5 - 1 mm and 0.1 mm, respectively. Although the
electron-emitting region 3005 is shown as being
rectangular centrally of the conductive thin film 3004,
the region 3005 is illustrated so only for the
convenience of drawing and does not exactly represent
the actual position and shape thereof.In those surface conduction electron-emitting
devices, including the one proposed by M. Hartwell, 
et. al., it has heretofore been customary that, before
starting emission of electrons, the conductive thin
