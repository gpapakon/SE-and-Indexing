<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a photothermographic 
silver halide material and.method for producing in such 
a material improved fog stability on shelf aging by 
incorporating dithioethers with two or more terminal 
hydroxy groups. Silver halide photothermographic imaging 
materials, often referred to as "dry silver" 
compositions because no liquid development is necessary 
to produce the final image, have been known in the art 
for many years. These imaging materials basically 
comprise a light insensitive, reducible silver source, 
a light sensitive material which generates silver when 
irradiated, and a reducing agent for the silver source. 
The light sensitive material is generally photographic 
silver halide which must be in catalytic proximity to 
the light insensitive silver source. Catalytic 
proximity is an intimate physical association of these 
two materials so that when silver specks or nuclei are 
generated by the irradiation or light exposure of the 
photographic silver halide, those nuclei are able to 
catalyze the reduction of the silver source by the 
reducing agent. It has been long understood that 
silver is a catalyst for the reduction of silver ions 
and the silver-generating light sensitive silver halide 
catalyst progenitor may be placed into catalytic 
proximity with the silver source in a number of 
different fashions, such as partial metathesis of the 
silver source with a halogen-containing source (e.g.,  
 
U.S. Pat. No. 3,457,075), coprecipitation of the silver 
halide and silver source material (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 
3,839,049), and any other method which intimately 
associates the silver halide and the silver source. Photothermographic emulsions, in a manner similar 
to photographic emulsions and other light sensitive 
systems, tend to suffer from fog. Fog is spurious 
image density which appears in unexposed areas of the 
element and is often reported in semitometric results 
as Dmin. Traditionally, photothermographic materials 
have suffered from fog instability on shelf aging. The 
fog level rises steadily as the materials reach 
extended age such as one year at room temperature 
(ambient conditions). Adding to the difficulty of fog 
control on shelf aging is the fact that the developer 
is incorporated in the photothermographic element, 
which is not the case in most silver halide 
photographic systems. The need for shelf life 
extenders in photothermographic elements is therefore 
considered to be very important. The fog level of freshly prepared 
photothermographic
