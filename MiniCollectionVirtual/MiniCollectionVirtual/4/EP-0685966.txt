<ABSTRACT>
High speed image search data are obtained from 
compression-coded moving image data for each frame/field). 

The obtained data are divided into ranges based on 
positions on a picture, and the range is divided based on 

the amount of codes. The divided data are multiplexed for 
each position in the picture as data are recorded at 

different positions on a track and a specific number of 
different frames are recorded alternately in each track. 

The multiplexed high speed image search data are recorded 
at specific positions on a recording medium. The picture 

ranges of frames are synthesized based on high speed image 
search data read from the recording medium, to construct 

a search image in unit of frame. Further, a special 
reproduction transfer rate is set based on a difference 

between the moving image data transfer rate and the maximum 
allowable recording transfer rate. Based on the set 

transfer rate, the special reproduction image data 
corresponding to the moving image data can be obtained. 

A recording format is set based on the special reproduction 
transfer rate. The moving image data, the special 

reproduction image data and the recording format are 
multiplexed in accordance with the set recording format. 

The multiplexed data train is recorded at specific 
positions on the recording medium. The format of the 

moving image data and the special reproduction image data 
is discriminated from the data train read from the 

recording medium. Further, any of the moving image data 
and the special reproduction image data are outputted 

according to the format. The moving image data and special 
reproduction image data are recorded on a recording medium 

as a ratio in code amount of both is changeable, and the 
special reproduction image data are equally divided into 

different ranges on one track.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
recording and reproducing compression-coded moving image
data to and from a medium (e.g., tape recording medium)
such as a digital VTR (video tape recorder), and more
specifically to a moving image recording and reproducing
apparatus suitable for use in a special reproduction such
as high speed image search, for instance.In the VTR, some special reproductions such as high
speed search are often required. In particular, the high
speed image search (referred to as high speed search,
hereinafter) is essential, by which images can be
reproduced at a high speed 5 to 50 times higher than the
ordinary (standard) reproduction speed. In the case of the
high speed search, since image data recorded by helical
scanning are read obliquely along the recording tracks, the
image is obtained being omitted partially. As a result,
in the case of an analog VTR, one picture is displayed
being divided into several portions.In the case of the digital VTR, on the other hand,
usually the high efficiency coding technique is adopted;
that is, image data are compressed in accordance with
variable length coding technique. In this case, since the
positions at which image data are recorded on a tape will
not synchronize with the positions at which the image data
are displayed on the picture, the image data displayed at
high speed search fluctuate in position on the displayed
picture, so that the obtained picture is extremely hard to
see. To overcome this problem, there has been proposed such
a method of recording image data for only the high speed
search are recorded separately at predetermined positions
on a tape. In this method, high speed search data are
recorded at predetermined several positions along the track
direction, and the same data are repeatedly recorded over
the ten tracks, for instance. In this method, if the high
speed search is conducted up to ten time speed (a speed ten
times higher than the standard tape travel speed), since
at least one of the ten tracks can be read without fail,
all the data for high speed search can be obtained
securely, with the result that it is possible to obtain
high speed search image of perfect frames or fields
Further, in the following description, the high speed
search of only frames will be explained in detail.In this method, however, since the high speed search
data recorded on predetermined positions on the tracks
become large, data for one frame cannot be recorded on one
track, so that data for one frame are divided into several
data.
