<ABSTRACT>
New, small and structurally simple immunomodulating oligopeptides are disclosed. The oligopeptides of this invention possess a long, lipophilic alkyl chain. These immunododulating oligopeptides can be used in conjunction with anti-viral or anti-cancer agents in the treatment of human and animal diseases. Processes for the syntheses of immunomodulating chemicals are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
immunomodulating oligopeptides which can modulate the 
body's immune system response to invading foreign 
substances and micro-organisms or malignant cells. The present invention is more particularly 
concerned with lipophilic desmuramyl-type peptide 
analogues of muramyl dipeptide and similar oligopeptides 
with lipophilic alkyl chains. Vertebrate animal immune systems are designed 
to protect the body from assault by parasites. These 
pathogens include acellular virus and cellular parasites 
such as bacteria, mycoplasms, fungi, unicellular 
protozoa and multicellular protozoa. The immune system 
also defends the organism against cancerous cells. Control and fine tuning of the immune system 
is a goal of medical therapists. Stimulation or 
suppression of the immune system is often called for in 
the treatment or prevention of medical conditions. 
Control is accomplished by chemicals, such as synthetic 
organics, biologicals, or macromolecules from natural 
sources, such as glycoproteins.  
 Immunomodulators, thus, offer a powerful tool 
for the control of infectious diseases. These chemicals 
modulate (stimulate or suppress) the immune system in a 
non-specific manner. Stimulation of immunity is also 
important in the host's defense against cancer. The 
latter occurs, for example, upon activation of 
tumoricidal macrophages in response to immunomodulators. 
Immunomodulators may also be used in the treatment of 
diseases caused by immune system disorders such as 
arthritis. They may also be used in the treatment of 
individuals with a compromised immune system in order to 
enhance their immune response. This group of patients 
includes surgery patients, burn victims, patients 
undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy and patients 
with immune disorders such as AIDS. In general, these immunocompromised patients 
can be affected by viral infections such as 
cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza, herpes zoster, herpes 
simplex, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 
potentially hepatitis. Immunomodulators can be used to 
stimulate the immune system and help in fighting the 
viral infection. Immunomodulators can also be used as 
prophylactic agents in prevention of such infections. Non-specific stimulation of the immune system 
also finds veterinary application as evidenced, for 
example, by the treatment of equine respiratory disease 
with a crude mycobacterial cell wall preparation. Some immunomodulators are known in the prior 
art. For example, Freund's Complete Adjuvant, a
