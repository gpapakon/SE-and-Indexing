<ABSTRACT>
A product obtained by recycling
domiciliary sweepings, for the manufacture of all type of

mouldable products. The product comprises a first component
containing plastic polyethylene and polypropylene materials

in a proportion that ranges between 25% and 30% of the
final weight of the product; a second component of plastic

PET type materials ranges between 30% and 40% of the total
weight of the product; and a third component selected from:

PVC, styrene, polyamides, polycarbonates, polystyrene, ABS,
aluminum and cardboard.
A procedure for obtaining the product, includes
separating from sweepings materials plastics materials

found without classifying nor washing them; crushing this
material in a mill (5); simultaneously warming up to a

temperature of up to 300°C and extruding said material
through an extruder (8) into a mould (9); and submerging

the mould (9) in a water tray (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is referred to an industrial
product, as a light post, a lamina or plates for
manufacturing several products such as furniture or the
like, which is obtained from plastics-based sweeping
material (refuse), which is obtained from domiciliary
sweepings recycled materials.The present invention will also be referred to a
method for obtaining this plastics-based recycled
material.The present application also discloses
transportable equipment
that is especially useful to recycle plastics-based
domiciliary sweepings (domestic refuse), especially plastic
trash habitually found in rubbish dumps such as plastic
bottles of drinks, cleaning products, etc.It is already widely known that plastic-based
sweeping materials usually take hundreds of years in
degrading itself. The enormous population growth that the 
great urban centre underwent in the last decades has caused
an exponential growth in the amount of sweeping materials,
this is the reason why the environmental contamination has
undergone a proportional increase to the previous
phenomenon.It is for that reason that industrialized countries
of the world have developed and taken active recycling
measures for treating sweepings materials, trying to
convince to the population on the importance of recovering
some materials such as glass, paper, plastics, etc., to
avoid that some highly polluting products normally found in
the sweepings materials become mixed with other organic
sweeping materials that can be naturally recycled
directly, by its fast normal decomposition.Most of the habitually used plastic packages in the
industry are made from non-degradable polymeric materials
generating a high contamination level when they are
disposed. At the present time, the practice has
demonstrated that in spite of the efforts that the
authorities of many countries make, and the campaigns that
are made to manage the objective of recycling domiciliary
sweepings, it was not still possible to manage an efficient
separation of highly polluting domiciliary sweeping
materials (as drink packages or cleaning products) from
organic materials. For that reason there is still a need of
trying to efficiently recycle those polluting sweeping 
materials so as to be able to stop or to try to restrain
the contamination process said polluting materials
generate.Several industrial equipments are known in the
market that uses sweeping materials as raw materials for
manufacturing industrial products. For example, Argentine

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a solid product from
recyclable plastics materials from urban sweepings

materials, comprising: the following steps of:

separating, from urban sweepings materials, a first
component A) containing polyethylene and polypropylene

plastics materials; a second component B) of PET-type
plastics materials; and a third component C) selected

from the group of: PVC, styrene, polyamides,
polycarbonates, polystyrene, ABS, aluminium and

cardboard;
providing a mixture comprising the components A, B
and C, wherein the proportions of components A and B are

respectively between 25% and 30%, and between 30% and
40%, of the total weight of the product;
crushing the mixture in a blades mill;
heating and extruding the crushed mixture at a temperature of

around 300°C to form the molten material;
pouring said molten material in a mould; and
cooling and taking off the solid product from the mould.
A method in accordance with claim 1, wherein said
components are obtained from domiciliary sweepings

materials.
A method in accordance with claim 2, wherein the
sweepings are not washed or dried. 
A method according to any of the preceding
claims, where in the mold has one of the following forms:


posts, tables, rods, braces, moldings, cords, roadside
ditches, boards or plates.
A solid product produced from recyclable
plastics materials from urban sweepings materials,

comprising: a first component A) containing polyethylene
and polypropylene plastics materials; a second component

B) of PET-type plastics materials and a third component
C) selected from the group of: PCV, styrene, polyamides,

polycarbonates, polystyrene, ABS, aluminium and
cardboard; wherein the proportions of components A and B

are respectively between 25% and 30%, and between 30% and
40%, of the total weight of the product; obtainable by

the method of any one of claims 1 to 4.
A sodid product according to
claim 5, wherein the solid product is similar to

a wooden product.
