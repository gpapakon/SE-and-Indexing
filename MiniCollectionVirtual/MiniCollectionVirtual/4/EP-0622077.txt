<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to prophylactic or therapeutic drug for diabetic 
nephropathy or glomerulonephritis, comprising, as an active ingredient, a 

compound or salt thereof represented by general formula (I) 

wherein R¹ stands for H or an optionally substituted hydrocarbon residue; R² 
stands for an optionally esterified carboxyl group; R³ stands for a group 

actually or potentially capable of forming an anion; X shows that the 
phenylene and phenyl groups bind to each other directly or through a spacer 

having an atomic chain length of two or less; n stands for 1 or 2; ring A stands 
for a benzene ring having an optional substituent in addition to R²; Y stands 

for a bond, -O-, -S(O)
m
- (wherein m stands for 0, 1 or 2), or -N(R⁴)- (wherein R⁴ 
stands for H or an optionally substituted alkyl group).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a prophylactic or therapeutic drug containing
an angiotensin II antagonistic compound or salt thereof as the active
constituent, for diabetic nephropathy or glomerulonephritis.The kidneys are a major target organ of hypertension. Prolonged
hypertension induces various renal impairments, mainly through
renovascular lesions. Among them, contraction of renal vessels and
degenerative lesions of elastic fibers lead to further elevation of the blood
pressure. It is generally believed that hypertension raises renal
intraglomerular pressure, which overloads the glomeruli, stimulating fibrosis
and enlargement of the mesangial region, which advances to hardening of the
glomeruli. In diabetic nephropathy as well, elevation in intraglomerular
pressure is followed by trace albuminuria, progressing to the sclerosis of the
glomeruli. Eventually, renal functions decline, resulting in chronic renal
failure requiring artificial dialysis therapy. In recent years, 20% of patients
with end-stage renal failure who commence artificial dialysis have diabetic
nephropathy as the underlying disease. The number of patients likely to
receive artificial dialysis tends to increase year after year, posing a critical
problem in the medical care system. At present, it is said that there are few
ideal pharmaceutical therapies for chronic renal failure, and even that blood-pressure-lowering
therapy may aggravate rather than improve renal failure.Angiotensin II antagonistic compounds are known as a therapeutic
drug for cardiovascular diseases, e.g., hypertension, cardiac diseases (heart
enlargement, heart failure, myocardial infarction, etc.), apoplexy, nephritis,
etc. (European Patent Official Gazette (EPO) 459136A). The mechanism of
their action is considered to be based on inhibition of binding to the
angiotensin II receptor of angiotensin II, which possesses intense
vasoconstrictive action. EP 459136A1 describes the availability of
angiotensin II antagonists in the treatment of nephropathy or nephritis.Many data of clinical and experimental studies have been reported on
the relation between renal diseases and hypertension. It is now established
that the kidneys are directly or indirectly involved in the onset of 
hypertension, and also are apt to be affected by hypertension.
However, hypertension in chronic glomerulonephritis has been
poorly elucidated, particularly as to causative factors,
effects of hypertension on the course of nephritis, and
prophylactic effects of blood pressure lowering
