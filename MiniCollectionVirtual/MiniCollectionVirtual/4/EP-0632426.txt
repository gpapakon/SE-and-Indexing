<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal display device and a method for driving the
same.Liquid crystal display devices (hereinafter,
referred to as "LCD devices") are widely used for
applications in, for example, desk-top calculators and
portable televisions. Although there are some problems
with LCD devices in relation to response speed, visibility
of images and the like, LCD devices will likely
replace CRTs (cathode ray tubes) in the near future.
In order to solve these problems, various technological
proposals and changes are being made.Currently, LCD devices using a nematic liquid
crystal material are in wide use. Examples of LCD
devices using a nematic liquid crystal material are
twisted nematic (hereinafter, referred to as "TN") LCD
devices and supertwisted birefringence effect (hereinafter,
referred to as "SBE") LCD devices.In the TN LCD devices, as the number of the
scanning lines is increased, the time period during
which application of a voltage to each scanning line is
permitted for putting the liquid crystal molecules into
an "ON" state or an "OFF" state becomes shorter, resulting
in an insufficient contrast. For this reason,
the TN LCD devices are not suitable for large capacity
display devices. In order to overcome the problem, SBE 
LCD devices or double layer SBE LCD devices have been
developed. However, in such LCD devices, as the number
of the scanning lines is increased, the contrast of
displayed images and the response speed are still low.
Currently, the maximum possible display capacity is
approximately 800 x 1024 lines.Further, display devices using a nematic
liquid crystal material have a serious problem in that
the viewing angle is narrow. In either the SBE LCD
devices or the double layer SBE LCD devices, satisfactory
values have not been obtained with regard to the
contrast of displayed images or the response speed.Active matrix LCD devices having thin film
transistors (hereinafter, referred to as the "TFTs") on
a substrate have also been developed. In such LCD
devices, a large display capacity of, for example,
1000 x 1000 lines and a high contrast are obtained.
However, since the active matrix LCD devices generally
use a TN liquid crystal material, the above-mentioned
problems in the viewing angle and the response speed
still remain.In the past, N. A. Clark and S. T. Lagerwall
proposed an LCD device using a chiral smectic C liquid
crystal material, namely, a ferroelectric liquid crystal
material (hereinafter, referred to as the "FLC
material") in order to solve these
