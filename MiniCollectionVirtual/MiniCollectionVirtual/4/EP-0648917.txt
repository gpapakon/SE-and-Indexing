<ABSTRACT>
A reciprocating engine has at least a cylinder (10) having a 
combustion chamber (16) at an upper portion thereof. A 

piston (12) reciprocates inside the cylinder (10) as a fuel gas is 
burnt in the combustion chamber (16). A rotatable 

cylindrical shaft member (1) extends in an axial direction 
of the cylinder (10). At least a top end portion of the 

cylindrical shaft member (1) is fittable within an inner 
bore of the piston (12). One or more of projections (4,5) are 

formed integrally with the piston (12) and projects toward 
the inner bore. One or more of endless spiral grooves (2,3) 

are formed at a periphery of the cylindrical shaft 
member (1) and adapted to engage the projections 

respectively. Reciprocation of the piston (12) is 
transformed into rotation of the cylindrical shaft 

member (1) through engagement between the projections (4,5) and 
the endless spiral grooves (2,3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanism for 
transforming reciprocation to rotation and vise versa, 
the former being incorporated into a reciprocating 
engine and the later being designed as a kind of pump 
and compressor, for example. A reciprocating engine has been knows as a 
typical one of internal combustion engines. The 
conventional reciprocating engines include gasoline 
engines typically for passenger cars and planes and 
diesel engines typically for various automobiles and 
shipping. As known, the reciprocating engines operate 
such that a compressed gas mixture of fuel and air is 
explosively burnt when ignited and the resulting 
expansion is transformed to reciprocation. A piston reciprocates twice in a cylinder as a 
four-cycle engine provides one cycle of operation 
comprising an inlet stroke, a compression stroke, an 
explosion stroke and an exhaust stroke. More 
particularly, when the piston moves down to create a 
negative pressure in the cylinder, the gas mixture is  
 
introduced into a combustion chamber through an opened 
inlet valve communicated therewith (inlet stroke). The 
inlet valve is then closed and the piston moves up to 
compress the gas mixture filled in the combustion 
chamber (compression stroke). The compressed gas 
mixture is ignited with a spark plug approximately when 
the piston reaches the top dead centre (T.D.C.) to cause 
explosive combustion and expansion of the gas mixture, 
which urges the piston to move down to the bottom dead 
centre (B.D.C.) in the explosion stroke. When the 
piston again moves up from the B.D.C., an exhaust valve 
communicated with the combustion chamber is opened to 
allow an engine exhaust to escape from the combustion 
chamber to the outside of the engine (exhaust stroke). These four strokes comprises one cycle of the 
engine operation and are repeated to create 
reciprocation of the piston. To the bottom end of the 
piston is connected one end of a connecting rod having 
the other end connected to a crank shaft, through which 
reciprocation of the piston is transformed into rotation 
of the crank shaft. As described above, the conventional design for a 
reciprocating engine employs the connecting rod and the 
crank shaft for transforming reciprocation of the piston 
into rotation. Two reciprocation of the piston occurs 
in one full cycle consisting of four strokes of inlet, 
compression, explosion and exhaust, which generates two  
 
rotation of the crank shaft. A ratio of transformation 
from reciprocation to rotation is 1:1.
