<ABSTRACT>
A device for coding a cable bunch comprising a plurality of conductors of mutually different colours or colour combinations, in which a first electrical connector (6) is provided on one end of the cable bunch and a second electrical connector (7) is connected to the device (8) to which the cable bunch (10) shall be connected, wherein the electrical connectors have a number of connector pins to which the conductors are connected individually, and wherein the electrical connectors when connected together are intended to transmit current or a signal from each of the conductors in the cable bunch to a predetermined connector pin in the second electrical connector. The invention is characterized in that there is provided along the cable bunch (10) a locking device (11) which includes a code unit (12) which is constructed to break and connect one or more conductors incoming from the cable bunch (10) to the code unit (12) to the same number of conductors outgoing from the code unit, so that when connecting the conductors, incoming conductors (1-5) of different respective colours or colour combinations are connected to outgoing conductors (1-5) of other respective colours or colour combinations, thereby to obtain a predetermined mixture of colours or colour combinations of the conductors (1-5) in the cable bunch (10) upstream and downstream of the code unit (12); in that the incoming conductors (1-5) are connected in the first electrical connector (6) to the predetermined correct connector pins with regard to the desired transmission of current or signals to the device (8); and in that the code unit (12) is controlled by an electronic lock (13) which is constructed to cause the code unit (12) to effect the conductor connections when the user opens the electronic lock.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cable bunch coding 
device. In different models of automotive vehicles, and also in 
electrical installations and electrical devices of 
different kinds, cable bunches are found in which the 
various cables or conductors are identified by different 
colours or colour combinations. Normally, a conductor or cable of given colour shall be 
connected to another conductor or cable of the same 
colour in different types of electrical connectors. One known method of preventing unauthorized use of an 
automotive vehicle or an electric device is to provide 
the cable bunch with a locking device in the form of a 
key operated switch. One such example is the car ignition 
lock. However, if some unauthorized person forces the lock, it 
is an easy matter for this person to connect together 
conductors of mutually the same colours and therewith 
bypass the lock. The conductors, or cables, are given 
the same colours in order for the mechanic who installs 
the system to be ware of how the different conductors in 
the cable bunch shall be connected-up. This facility, 
however, makes unauthorized use of the vehicle easier to 
achieve, simply by bypassing the lock. This problem is solved by means of the present invention, 
which provides an electronic lock which renders 
unauthorized use of the vehicle, or electrical device, 
extremely difficult, if not impossible.  
 The present invention thus relates to a device for 
coding a cable bunch which includes a number of cables, 
or conductors, of mutually different colours or colour 
combinations, where a first electrical connector is present 
at one end of the cable bunch and a second electrical 
connector is connected to the device to which the 
cable bunch shall be connected, and where the electrical 
connectors have a number of connector pins to which said 
conductors are connected individually, said electrical 
connectors being intended to be connected together for 
transmission of electric current or an electric signal 
from one of the conductors in the cable bunch to a 
predetermined connector pin in the second electrical 
connector, and is characterized in that there is provided 
along the cable bunch a locking device which includes 
a coding unit which is intended to break and mutually 
connect one or more conductors incoming to the coding 
unit with the same number of conductors outgoing from 
the coding unit so that, when connecting the conductors 
together, incoming conductors of different respective 
colours or colour

A device for coding a cable bunch comprising a 
plurality of conductors of mutually different colours or 

colour combinations, in which a first electrical connector 
(6) is provided on one end of the cable bunch and a 

second electrical connector (7) is connected to the 
device (8) to which the cable bunch (10) shall be connected, 

wherein the electrical connectors have a number 
of connector pins to which said conductors are connected 

individually, and wherein the electrical connectors when 
connected together are intended to transmit current or a 

signal from each of the conductors in the cable bunch to

to break and connect one or more conductors incoming 

from the cable bunch (10) to the code unit (12) to the 
same number of conductors outgoing from the code unit, 

so that when connecting the conductors, incoming conductors 
(1-5) of different respective colours or colour 

combinations are connected to outgoing conductors (1-5) 
of other respective colours or colour combinations, 

thereby to obtain a predetermined mixture of colours or 
colour combinations of the conductors (1-5) in the cable 

bunch (10) upstream and downstream of the code unit 
(12); in that the incoming conductors (1-5) are connected 

in the first electrical connector (6) to the predetermined 
correct connector pins with regard to the

are controlled by the electronic lock (13). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that when weaker currents or signals 
are to be transmitted, the code unit (12) includes a 

processor which is controlled by the electronic lock
