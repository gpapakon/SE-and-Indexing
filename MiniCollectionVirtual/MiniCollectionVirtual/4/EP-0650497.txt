<ABSTRACT>
A process for obtaining a recombinant protein in its natural and bioactive form from a solution containing inactive protein, present in the form of either an insoluble inclusion body or oxidized, misfolded and aggregated waste protein comprises diluting the solution of inactive protein with a first alkaline buffer solution, adding SDS and L-cysteine to simultaneously solubilize and reduce the protein, decreasing the concentration of the SDS and L-cysteine by about 70-90 % by diafiltration against a second alkaline buffer solution, and oxidizing the denatured and reduced protein to form disulfide bonds which correspond to those present in the naturally occurring bioactive protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A PROCESS FOR RECOVERING A RECOMBINANT PROTEIN, IN BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE FORM, FROM A SOLUTION CONTAINING INACTIVE PROTEINFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to a method for recovering recombinant proteins in their natural and bioactive forms from solutions containing inactive protein.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Methods for producing recombinant proteins are well known in the art; heterologous DNA segments that encode for a particular protein are inserted into host microorganisms using recombinant technology. By growing the transformant microorganisms under conditions which induce the expression of proteins, heterologous proteins such as insulin, somatotropins, interleukins, interferons, somatomedins, and the like can be produced.Unfortunately, heterologous proteins produced by transformant microorganisms are frequently not biologically active because they do not fold into the proper tertiary structure when transcribed within the microorganism. The heterologous proteins tend to form aggregates which are recognizable within the cell as "inclusion bodies" (also sometimes referred to a"refractile bodies" and/or "protein granules"). These inclusion bodies also may be caused by the formation of 

covalent intermolecular disulfide bonds which link together several protein molecules to form insoluble complexes. The inclusion bodies generally contain mostly heterologous proteins and a small fraction of contaminating host microorganism proteins .Several processes have been developed to extract the inclusion bodies from the microorganisms and convert the heterologous proteins contained therein into proteins having native bioactivity consistent with the native parent or nonrecombinant proteins. These processes generally involve disrupting the microorganism cell; separating the inclusion bodies from cell debris; denaturing and/or reducing the inclusion body proteins in the presence of a denaturant and/or reducing agent to cause the proteins to unfold and separate themselves from insoluble contaminants; removing or reducing the concentration of the reducing agent present in solution; oxidizing the reduced and denatured protein solution in the presence of the denaturant, removing the denaturant, thereby allowing the heterologous proteins to refold into a tertiary conformation; and separating the protein from the contaminating proteins that remain in solution. Several recombinant protein recovery and purification schemes following this general procedure are known in the art:U.S. Patent No. 4,985,544

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A process for obtaining a recombinant protein in its natural and bioactive form from a solution containing biologically inactive protein, comprising the steps of: a) diluting the solution of inactive protein with a first alkaline buffer solution; b) treating the diluted protein with sufficient SDS as a denaturing agent and L-cysteine as a reducing agent to simultaneously solubilize and reduce said protein; c) decreasing the concentration of the SDS and the L-cysteine in the resultant solution by about 70 to about 90 percent by diafiltration against a second alkaline buffer solution; and d) oxidizing the denatured and reduced protein of step (c) to form disulfide bonds which correspond to those present in the naturally occurring bioactive protein. 2.
