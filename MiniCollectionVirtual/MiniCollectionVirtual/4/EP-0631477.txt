<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a very low fat water-in-oil spread and a spread obtainable by the process. The process entails a cold mixing procedure wherein an at least partially pre-gelled aqueous phase is mixed by back-mixing with an at least partially pre-solidified fat continuous emulsion of fat and water. Emulsions of less than 30 % fat and even 20 % or less fat may be prepared.

<DESCRIPTION>
Studies have suggested the need for individuals to reduce 
their intake of fat, particularly saturated fat, to minimize 
the risk of cardiac and other diseases. Moreover, the reduction 
of overall calories ingested has been of inte- rest to 
prevent obesity, which has been linked to diabetes, heart 
disease and other ailments. In recognition of the need to reduce intake of fat and to 
decrease the total number of calories consumed, efforts have 
been undertaken to reduce substantially the amount of fat 
and the overall calorie count of bread spreads, including 
those which function to replace butter. For reasons of 
microbiological stability and resemblance to butter, it is 
desirable that such spreads be fat-continuous. However, as 
the amount of fat is decreased below 35%, and particularly 
below 30%, it becomes increasingly difficult to formulate a 
stable, fat-continuous spread which is acceptable to consumers. 
Factors related to consumer acceptance of a spread 
include the ease of spreading on bread and the similarity to 
butter of its melting characteristics, both on bread and in 
the mouth. Izzo et al. US-A-4,882,187 discloses a process for preparing 
an edible spread having a lower fat content than butter or 
margarine. The process includes admixing with an aqueous 
composition a plastic dispersion having a continuous fat 
phase and a discontinuous aqueous phase. The dispersed 
aqueous phase has a pH above 4.7 and contains proteins 
whereas the aqueous composition has a pH at or below 4.7, 
contains hydrocolloid and is substantially free of milk and 
soy protein. The mixture of the continuous fat phase and  
 
the aqueous composition is worked at a temperature at which 
the fat-continuous phase remains plastic. Izzo et al. 
discuss the use of either high or low shear. The Izzo et al. spread is said to include one fat phase and 
two distinct aqueous phases. The need for emulsifiers is 
said to be reduced or eliminated. Particularly good results 
are said to be obtained when butter is used as the fat-continuous 
plastic dispersion, although it is said that common 
margarine may be employed. It is said that spreads having 
as little as 26% fat have been prepared in accordance with 
the Izzo et al. invention without the assistance of emulsifiers; 
the preferred range is 30-65% fat. Preferred products 
are said to be made with butter and gelatin solutions, 
and in discussing the temperature range of the gelatin 
solution it is stated that once the gelatin solution has 
gelled, the resulting product
