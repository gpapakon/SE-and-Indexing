<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is provided for maximum likelihood sequence estimation. The apparatus includes a first maximum likelihood sequence estimator (44) in a signal path for flat fading and an at least second maximum likelihood sequence estimator (45) in other signal path for other than fading. The apparatus further includes a switch (47) for selecting the signal path with a least relative magnitude means square error.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention relates to decoding of radio
signals and, in particular, to maximum likelihood sequence
estimation.The effects of a radio channel upon a radio signal
transmitted on the radio channel are well known. Well-known
effects include poor signal quality due to low signal
to noise ratio (SNR), adjacent and co-channel interference
and multi-path propagation. Where extreme distance is a
factor a poor SNR may be due to thermal noise. Where
distance is slight a poor SNR may be due to competing
signals on the same or an adjacent channel.Multi-path propagation, on the other hand, produces
an effect on the signal characterized by multiple copies of
the signal being presented to a receiver at slightly different
times and with slightly different phases. In extreme cases
multiple copies of a signal may arrive at a receiver offset
over a time interval comparable to a symbol transmission
rate.The problem of multi-path propagation results in a
summation of signals being presented to a receiver that
may bear little resemblance to the originally transmitted
signal. Where either the transmitter or receiver is moving
(e.g., a radiotelephone in an automobile) the problem of
multi-path propagation may be further aggravated in that
the effects on the signal may also vary with physical
location.Past efforts to improve decoding of signals subject to
low SNR and the effects of multi-path propagation have
included adding a training (synchronization) sequence to
the beginning of data transmission within a frame of
information and cross-correlating the received signal 
against the known training sequence. The results of the
cross-correlation are then used to characterize and
compensate for the affects of the transmission channel.While characterizing the transmission channel is
effective for short periods, such characterization may not
be effective for frames having durations of several
milliseconds. For frames of longer duration the transmitter
and receiver may change physical locations thereby changing
the transmission channel and altering transmission
characteristics.Past efforts to improve performance under such
conditions have included the systems discussed in IEEE
Transactions On Information Theory, January 1973, pgs. 120-124,
