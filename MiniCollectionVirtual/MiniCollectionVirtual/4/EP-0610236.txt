A process for producing nickelized shaped articles 
by electrodeposition of nickel from aqueous acidic 

baths containing as essential constituents one or more 
nickel salts, one or more inorganic acids and one or more 

brighteners, which comprises using brighteners that are 
cyclic ammonium compounds of the general formula I 


 
where the nitrogen atom is part of a pyridine, quinoline 

or isoquinoline ring system which can additionally carry 
one or two C₁-C₄-alkyl substituents,
 
R¹ and R² are each hydrogen or C₁-C₄-alkyl,
 
A is a group of the formula -CO-O-R³, -CO-CH₂-CO-O-R³, 

-O-CO-R³ or -O-R³, where
 
R³ is C₁-C₁₂-alkyl, C₅-C₈-cycloalkyl, C₇-C₁₂-phenylalkyl or 

phenyl which can be substituted by one or two C₁-C₄-alkyl 
radicals, C₁-C₄-alkoxy radicals, halogen atoms, hydroxyl 

groups, phenyl radicals or C₁-C₄-alkoxycarbonyl groups,
 
m is from 0 to 10, n is from 1 to 4, p is 0 or 1, and
 
X
⊖
 is an n-valent inorganic or organic anion which 
promotes water solubility,
 
with the proviso that for p = 0 and A = -CO-O-C₁-C₁₂-alkyl 

m must not be 1, 2 or 3 and under the same conditions R¹ 
must not be hydrogen when m is 0. 
A process for producing nickelized shaped articles 
as claimed in claim 1, wherein the brighteners used

or from 4 to 10, with the proviso that R¹ is not hydrogen 

when k is 0. 
A process for producing nickelized shaped articles 
as claimed in claim 1, wherein the brighteners used

where the variables m, n and X
⊖
 are each as defined above 
and R⁵ is C₇-C₁₂-phenylalkyl or phenyl which can be substituted 

by one or two C₁-C₄-alkyl radicals. 
A process for producing nickelized shaped articles 
as claimed in claim 1, wherein the brighteners used 

are cyclic ammonium compounds of the general formula Ic 

 
where the variables R¹, R², R³, m, n and X
⊖
 are each as 
defined above. 
A process for producing nickelized shaped 
articles as claimed in claim 1, wherein the brighteners 

used are cyclic ammonium compounds of the general  
 

formula Id

defined above. 
A process for producing nickelized shaped articles 
as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, wherein in 

addition to the cyclic ammonium compounds I at least one 
further brightener is used.  

 
Cyclic ammonium compounds of the general 
formula Ig 


 
where R⁴ is C₁-C₁₂-alkyl or C₅-C₈-cycloalkyl, k is 0 or 

from 4 to 10, n is from 1 to 4, X
