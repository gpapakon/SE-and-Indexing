<ABSTRACT>
A monitoring system 10 having a stylus 16 mounted to a 
support 110 that controllably moves the stylus along a travel 

path as it contacts an object of interest 12. The object is 
supported by a rotating turntable 30 and held in place by a 

manually actuatable retainer 36 that exerts a repeatable downward 
force on the object. A frame 110 that supports the stylus is 

supported by a flexure plate that makes the task of orienting the 
frame easier. The frame supports a saddle that can be raised and 

lowered by a belt system driven by a D.C. pancake motor. The 
entire monitoring system achieves a required degree of accuracy 

in monitoring object shape at a reduced manufacturing cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an automated monitoring system for
determining or confirming the shape of a machined item such as a gear.The present applicant, M&M Precision Systems
Corporation, has commercialized prior monitoring systems for determining or
confirming the shape of a machined item such as a gear and the like. These prior
art monitoring systems are commercially sold under the designation Model
Numbers 3012, 3018, 3025, 3040 and 3060 where the last two digits indicate the
diameter of the workpieces (in inches) the system is capable of monitoring.The prior art systems sold by the Assignee of the invention include a
moveable frame mounted to a base and including a drive system for moving a
stylus or probe along three independent directions by controlled energization of
multiple drive motors. As an example, the frame could be moved horizontally in
the direction of a first axis by means of a motor that rotates a precision ground
ballscrew. As the ballscrew rotates the frame is moved very accurately with respect
to an origin.The carriage supports an arm extending away from the frame having a
stylus at one end which comes into contact with the object under examination.
The stylus is constructed using an LVDT monitoring probe. Such a probe
produces an output signal related to the position of a moveable probe member
with respect to the probe body. Through a controlled monitoring of the output
signals from the probe, and controlled continuous movement of the frame,
including a feedback monitoring of optical encoder signals as the frame moves, 
the monitoring system can accurately determine the position of the moveable
probe tip. This allows the monitoring system to accurately compare any curve on
a surface of a machined part with the desired shape of that surface. Alternately
the monitoring system can test an unknown surface and store a representation of
the part for later use as a standard.In accordance with the prior art monitoring systems, the object under
examination is supported on a turntable and held in place by a clamping member
having a live center which is motor actuated. The object under examination is
placed on the turntable and the clamp energized to bring the object engaging
portion of the clamp into engagement with the object. Once the object has been
secured to the turntable, controlled energization of a turntable drive causes the
object to rotate. Precise control over the turntable rotation is achieved by means
of an air bearing which supports the turntable above a turntable support

<CLAIMS>
A monitoring system (10) comprising

a stylus (16) mounted
to a support (110) that can be moved along a controlled travel path as the stylus

(16) contacts an object (12), and comprising:
