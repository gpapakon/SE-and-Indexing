<ABSTRACT>
A multiple layer wraparound sleeve (21) having a 
heat shrinkable backing layer (22) and at least one 

functional layer in the form of a discrete sheet (23) which 
is connected to one end of the backing layer (22), and is of 

at least sufficient length that, when the sleeve (21) is 
wrapped around the pipe (17) or other substrate at least 

twice, the functional layer sheet (23) wraps around the 
substrate (17) first with its ends overlapping and the 

backing layer (22) wraps around the functional layer sheet 
(23) with its ends overlapping. This allows wrappings of 

reduced thickness to be employed without problems of voids 
occurring between the functional layer and the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
Multiple layer wraparound heat shrinkable sleeves 
have been used for many years for sealing and protecting 
pipes, cables and the like. Such sleeves consist usually of 
a layer of crosslinked plastic sheet which is dimensionally 
heat unstable in one direction, on top of which is coated or 
laminated one or more layers of functional material. The 
direction of shrinkage is such that, when the sleeve is 
wrapped around an article, such as a pipe joint or a cable, 
the sleeve will, upon heating, decrease in circumference in 
relation to said object until it conforms tightly to the 
shape and profile of said object. By "functional material" 
is meant, as will be understood by those skilled in the art, 
a material which performs a function which the heat unstable 
sheet cannot adequately perform on its own. Most commonly a 
single functional material layer is used, and consists of a 
heat-activable polymer composition, such as a hot melt 
adhesive or a mastic sealant. The term "heat activable" 
refers to the fact that, upon heating to a moderate 
temperature a beneficial change in properties occurs, which 
will promote the function of said layer. In the case of a 
so-called "hot melt adhesive", the functional layer converts 
from what is essentially a solid, non-tacky state to what is 
essentially a fluid, tacky state, thus allowing it to fill in 
surface irregularities and form an adequate bond to the 
surface. In the case of a so-called "mastic sealant", the 
functional layer is converted from a soft gummy material 
which does not readily flow under the influence of gravity, 
to a flowable liquid which will fill in surface 
irregularities. Upon cooling, both types of functional 
material layer revert to the state they were in prior to 
heating. By "moderate temperatures" is meant a temperature 
which is not so high as to deteriorate the heat shrinkable 
layer, the functional material layer itself, or the substrate 
upon which the sleeve is being applied. Of course other 
types of functional material layers may be used, such as 
materials which crosslink at the shrinkage temperature, 
materials which are electrically conductive, and the like.  The heat shrinkable layer is most usually a sheet 
of olefinic polymer, such as polyethylene or a copolymer 
thereof, which has been crosslinked to render it non-melting 
and subsequently stretched and cooled in the stretched 
condition. If the temperature of the sheet is subsequently 
raised to or above the crystalline melting temperature of the 
main component

<CLAIMS>
A multiple layer wraparound heat shrinkable sleeve 
comprising a sheet of dimensionally heat unstable flexible 

material having longitudinally spaced end portions capable of 
being brought into overlapping relation when the sheet is 

applied to an article in wrapping relation thereto, the 
material of the sheet being crosslinked and weldable to 

itself and having been stretched in the longitudinal 
direction from an originally heat stable form to a 

dimensionally heat unstable form capable of moving in the 
direction of its original form by the application of heat 

alone, characterized in that one end portion has connected 
thereon at least one flexible auxiliary sheet comprising a 

functional material and of length at least sufficient to 
encircle the article and the other end portion has an exposed 

portion directly overlapping on and weldable to said one end 
portion when the auxiliary sheet is wrapped around the 

article with its end portions overlapping and the 
dimensionally heat unstable sheet is wrapped over the 

auxiliary sheet with its end portions overlapping. 
A sleeve according to claim 1 characterized in that 
the auxiliary sheet comprises a sheet of heat activable 

sealant or adhesive, preferably in the form of a self 
supporting film or laminated to a carrier sheet. 
A sleeve according to claim 1 or 2 characterized by 
a further flexible auxiliary sheet connected on an end of the 

first mentioned auxiliary sheet opposite the dimensionally 
unstable sheet and of length at least sufficient to encircle 

said article and overlap, whereby a three-layer wrapping may 
be formed. 
A sleeve according to claim 3 characterized in that 
the first mentioned auxiliary sheet comprises a 

longitudinally heat shrinkable and fusible sheet and the 
further auxiliary sheet comprises a heat activable sealant or 

 
adhesive. 
A sleeve according to claim 4 characterized in that 
the sheet of dimensionally heat unstable material is non-adherent 

to and is strippable from said fusible sheet. 
A sleeve according to claim 3 characterized in that 
the first mentioned auxiliary sheet comprises a sealant or 

adhesive and the further auxiliary sheet comprises a flexible 
metal sheet. 
A sleeve according to claim 3 characterized in that 
the first mentioned auxiliary sheet comprises a non-crosslinked 

electrically insulative polymeric material, the 
further auxiliary sheet comprises a non-crosslinked polymeric 

composition capable of modifying lines of electric field, and 
the heat shrinkable sheet comprises a crosslinked semi-conductive 

composition capable of providing an outer screen 
on a high voltage cable construction. 
A sleeve according to any preceding claim 
characterized in that the or at least one auxiliary sheet is 

of different width from and preferably narrower than the 
dimensionally heat unstable sheet. 
A sleeve according to claim 1 characterized in that 
the or at least one auxiliary sheet comprises a mesh of 

reinforcing fibres. 
A sleeve according to any preceding claim 
characterized by a hold down adhesive portion on the 

dimensionally heat unstable sheet adjacent the exposed end 
portion, for initially holding the said other end portion in 

overlapped position.
