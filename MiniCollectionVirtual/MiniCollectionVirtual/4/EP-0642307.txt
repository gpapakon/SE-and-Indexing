<ABSTRACT>
The method for production of a whey protein hydrolyzate comprises the use of a whey protein product produced by acidic precipitation of casein as a starting material and combined with a non-pH-stat hydrolysis. The method provides a well tasting and organoleptically acceptable product with low allergenicity in high yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention comprises a method for production of a whey protein
hydrolyzate and the thus produced whey protein hydrolyzate.Many methods for production of a protein hydrolyzate with good
organoleptic properties can be carried out with a low yield only. Also, a disadvantage
in regard to the prior art whey protein hydrolyzates is the fact that the allergenicity
thereof is open to improvement. Thus, it is the purpose of the invention to indicate a
method for production of a whey protein hydrolyzate with reduced allergenicity and
with good organoleptic properties, which can be carried out with a relatively high
yield.Surprisingly, according to the invention it has been found that a selection
of a specified starting material in combination with a non-pH-stat hydrolysis provides
a process for production of a low allergenicity and organoleptically acceptable
product in high yield.Thus, the method according to the invention for production of a whey
protein hydrolyzate is characterized by the fact
1) that whey protein obtained from production of acid precipitated casein is mixed
with water to a slurry with a protein content up to 20%, preferably up to 12%,2) that a heat treatment to a temperature above 60°C is carried out,3) that the mixture from step 2) is proteolytically hydrolyzed by means of at least
one protease, by means of a non-pH-stat method to a DH of between 15 and
35%, and4) that the hydrolysis is terminated by inactivation of the enzyme(s), and further
that the mixture from step 3) or 4) is separated on an ultrafiltration/microfiltration
unit with cut-off value above 10,000, preferably above 50,000, the permeate
constituting the protein hydrolyzate.A whey protein hydrolyzate with a composition similar to the whey protein
hydrolyzate produced by means of the method according to the invention is
described in US 4,427,658.Also, EP 226221 describes a whey protein hydrolyzate, which however,
in contradistinction to the whey protein hydrolyzate produced by means of the
method according to the invention is free from lactose and is produced by means
of the pH-stat techniques.Also, US 4,293,571, EP 321603 and EP 322589 describe a whey protein
hydrolyzate, which is produced by hydrolysis with subsequent heat treatment, in
contradistinction to the whey protein hydrolyzate produced by means of the method
according to the invention, i.e. by means of heat treatment with subsequent
hydrolysis. The high values of the degree of hydrolysis which can be obtained
according to the invention, cannot be obtained with the
