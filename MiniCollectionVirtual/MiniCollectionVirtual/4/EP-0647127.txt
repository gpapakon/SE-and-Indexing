<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ophthalmic lens
combination and more particularly to an ophthalmic lens combination
for use by patients having a condition known as macular
degeneration.Macular degeneration, which is generally agerelated,
affects a central region of the retina known as
the macula. Macular degeneration can lead to a gradual
or rapid loss of vision to the level of 20/200 or less.
It may affect, for example, only about 1/4 to 4 square
millimeters of the macula, thereby leaving 95 to 99
percent of the retina unaffected. Accordingly, central
vision, such as for reading and watching television, can
be lost while peripheral vision remains relatively
intact.Vision problems for the patient are compounded
if macular degeneration is also accompanied by cataracts
on the natural lens of the affected individual. One way
of dealing with this compounded vision problem is
disclosed in Donn et al Patent No. 4,710,197. The
disclosed approach is to replace the cataractic natural
lens of the eye with a negative intraocular lens and to
employ a single, positive lens element on a spectacle
frame in combination with the intraocular lens (IOL). A
positive or negative contact lens may also be used in
this system to further correct the patient's vision.Another approach is disclosed in Portney U.S.
Patent No. 5,030,231. This patent discloses an IOL with 
a negative IOL portion and bi-element spectacles serving
as a positive lens to direct light toward the negative
lens portion of the IOL.US-A-4 957 506 discloses a magnifying ophthalmic
lens system in accordance with the Pre-characterising
portion of claim 1.EP-A-0 461 856 discloses a Petzval objective
lens system .EP-A-0 157 476 discloses a diffractive lens.It is often desirable to minimize the vertex
distance, i.e., the spacing between the outer surface of
the eye and the spectacle lens. A large vertex distance
reduces the field of fixation, i.e., the maximum angle
within which the eye can move and still see an object
clearly and tends to make the spectacles less comfortable
to wear and not aesthetically pleasing. A large vertex
distance also tends to draw attention to the visual
handicap of the wearer. A telephoto lens system as
described in US-A-5 196 028 or WO-A-93/01765 (application Serial No. 730,471 filed on
July 16, 1991) can be used to reduce the vertex distance.This invention provides a number of important
improvements in an ophthalmic lens system of the type
usable to assist a patient with central retinal visior
problems of which macular degeneration is one
