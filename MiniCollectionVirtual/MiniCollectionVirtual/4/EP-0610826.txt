<ABSTRACT>
Improved centrifugal pump of the type comprising a 
supporting body (10) for a permanent-magnet synchronous 

motor with an impeller (49) coupled to its rotor (22), and 
for a volute (48) in which the impeller is accommodated. 

The body (10) and the volute (48) form a sealed housing 
which contains the rotor and the impeller in respective 

chambers, separating them from the stator part of the 
motor. The rotor (22) is rigidly coupled to a shaft (24) 

that rotates on sliding bearings (26,29) supported by 
elastic supports (27) which are locked in the corresponding 

chamber; one of these supports forms a ring for providing 
hydraulic sealing between the two chambers of the 

container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
centrifugal pump. The pump can be used, particularly but not 
exclusively, as a pump for dishwashers, as a pump for other 
household appliances, as a circulating pump for heating 
systems, etc. Known pumps suitable for these uses are coupled to 
asynchronous electric motors and consequently entail some 
problems particularly due to the fact that the rotor parts 
are air-immersed. This leads to a certain noisiness and to the need to 
adequately lubricate the supports and the rotation bearings 
to avoid their early wear. Centrifugal pumps with an asynchronous permanent-magnet 
motor, in which the rotor part is contained in a 
sealed housing separating it from the stator part and 
containing a lubricating liquid, are also known. However, these pumps have proved to be unsuitable for 
the particular use requiring rather large flow-rates and 
heads which they cannot achieve since the motor, by being 
able to start indifferently in one rotation direction or 
the other, entails the use of unsophisticated and low-efficiency 
hydraulics. The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the 
drawbacks mentioned above in pumps with asynchronous motor. A consequent primary object of the present invention 
is to prevent the onset of noise, vibrations or early wear  
 
due to insufficient lubrication. Another important object is to prevent the start-up 
problems occurring in current pumps with air-immersed rotor 
due to the mutual sticking of the parts when not in use. With this aim in view, as well as these and other 
objects which will become apparent hereinafter, there is 
provided, according to the present invention, an improved 
centrifugal pump of the type comprising a supporting body 
for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor with an impeller 
coupled to its rotor, and for a volute in which said 
impeller is accommodated, said body and said volute forming 
a sealed housing which contains the rotor and the impeller 
in respective chambers, separating them from the stator 
part of said motor, said pump being characterized in that 
said rotor is rigidly coupled to a shaft that rotates on 
sliding bearings supported by elastic supports which are 
locked in the corresponding chamber, one of said supports 
defining a ring for providing hydraulic sealing between the 
two chambers of said housing. Further characteristics and advantages of the 
centrifugal pump according to the present invention will 
become apparent from the following detailed description of 
a preferred but
