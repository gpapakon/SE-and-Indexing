<ABSTRACT>
A fluidized bed includes an air blower, a 
heater, an air/air heat exchanger (32) with auxiliary fans (36), 

and an air/cold water heat exchanger (34). The fluidized bed 
includes a remotely disposed portable water chiller (48) that 

provides the cold water for circulating in the air/cold 
water heat exchanger (34). The water chiller (48) includes a water 

refrigeration unit and a water pump. Flexible tubing 
carries cooled water from the water chiller (48) to the 

air/cold water heat exchanger (34) and relatively warmed water 
from the air/cold water heat exchanger (34) to the water 

chiller (48). Each of the free ends of the tubing, the water 
chiller (48), and the air/cold water heat exchanger (34), is 

provided with mating male or female connectors to enable 
the tubing to be selectively connected and disconnected 

between the water chiller (48) and the air/water heat 
exchanger (34). A programmable EPROM (74) uses temperature 

information from temperature sensors and the operating 
characteristics of the heater, air/air heat exchanger (32), 

fans, air/water heat exchanger (34), and water chiller (48) to 
control the operation of the heater, the fans (36), and the 

water chiller (48) for optimum efficiency in maintaining a 
desired temperature of the patient support surface under 

the extant temperature conditions in the environment of 
the fluidized bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems that
support a patient on a support surface defined by
granular material that has been fluidized with
pressurized air passing through the granular material and
more particularly to such systems having improved control
over the temperature of the patient support surface.Typically, the air used to fluidize the
granular material of a fluidized patient support system
such as shown in U.S. Patent No. 4.564,965 is
pressurized by an air blower. When the ambient air has
passed through the blower, the temperature of the air has
been increased by about 20Â° C or more. As this air
impinges upon the patient supported on the fluidized
support surface, the temperature of this air becomes a
concern for patient care and comfort.In U.S. Patent No. 4,637,083 a fluidized
patient support apparatus deploys a heat exchanger 54
between the fluid pressure generator means 50 and a
common fluid pressure manifold 29, which carries the air
that fluidizes the granular material 40 carried in the
tank 15.In U.S. Patent No. 5,016,304, an air drying unit
8 is interposed in the path of the air between the blower
and the plenum chamber beneath the beads of a fluidized
bed. Cooling of the fluidizing air takes place in the air
treatment chamber 8, and this condenses moisture from the
air in chamber 8 such that dry air arrives in the
fluidization chamber 2 via a duct 4 and the distribution 
space 3 and can return to the surrounding atmosphere via
the lying surface 1a. The evaporating means 7 located in
air treatment chamber 8, is part of a cooling circuit
which consists of a compressor 12 and a condenser 13.
Compressor 12 regulates transportation of a coolant such
as freon via the connecting lines in the direction of
arrow P2 along the previously mentioned evaporating means
7. However, the use of freon gas in the hospital
environment is to be avoided in general and in particular
in a fluidized bed so that an accidental leakage of freon
cannot become mixed with fluidization air.In U.S. Patent No. 4,609,854,a fluidized bed is
provided with a cooler 7 to cool air that is supplied to
a tank 2 containing the beads of a fluidized bed. A
sensor S1 is provided in tank 2 to detect the temperature
of the beads. A fan motor FM circulates air around the
cooling fins of cooler 7 so that cooled, compressed air
causes the beads to move around in tank 2.In U.S. Patent No. 4,723,328,a fluidized bed
includes a radiator 11 in a conduit 10, which couples an
air blower to the plenum chamber so that the blower can
supply
