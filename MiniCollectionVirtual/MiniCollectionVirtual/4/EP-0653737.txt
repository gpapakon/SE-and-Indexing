<ABSTRACT>
A detection device 10 includes a transmitter 
14 which transmits a transmitted signal 16 of a first 

characteristic and, upon the occurrence of a 
predetermined event, causes a change in the 

characteristic of the transmitted signal 16. A receiver 
18 is arranged remote from the transmitter 14, the 

receiver 18 being responsive to the transmitter 14. A 
discernible alarm 20 is connected to the receiver 18 to 

be activated by the receiver 18 when the receiver 18 
receives the transmitted signal of changed 

characteristic or the receiver 18 fails to receive the 
transmitted signal 16.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a detection device. 
More particularly, the invention relates to a detection 
device for detecting the occurrence of a predetermined 
event.  According to the invention, there is provided 
a detection device for detecting the occurrence of a 
predetermined event, the detection device including
 
   a transmitter means which transmits a transmitted 
signal of a first characteristic and, upon the 
occurrence of a predetermined event, causes a change in 
the characteristic of the transmitted signal;
 
   a receiver means arranged remote from the 
transmitter means, the receiver means being responsive 
to the transmitter means; and
 
   a discernible alarm means connected to the receiver 
means to be activated by the receiver means when the 
receiver means receives the transmitted signal of 
changed characteristic or the receiver means fails to 
receive the transmitted signal. In this specification, the term "a change in  
 
the characteristic of the transmitted signal" is to be 
understood as including cessation of transmission of the 
signal. The device may include a detecting unit to 
which the transmitter means is connected, the sensing 
means forming part of the detecting unit. The detecting unit may further include a 
signal generating means for generating the transmitted 
signal. Then, the receiver means may include a 
detection circuit for detecting the transmitted signal. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, 
the signal generating means is operable to generate a 
series of pulses on a substantially continuous basis. Then, the detection circuit may include a 
missing pulse detector such that, in the absence of a 
predetermined number of pulses in the transmitted 
signal, the alarm means is activated by the receiving 
means. In addition, the signal generating means may be 
operable to generate, periodically, an identification 
code which is included in the transmitted signal. Hence, it will be appreciated that, in use, 
the transmitter means transmits a signal comprising a 
string of pulses and, interspersed therein, the  
 
identification code. This signal is detected by the 
detection circuit of the receiving means and, while the 
signal is being received, the receiving means remains in 
a quiescent state and the alarm means is inactive. The device may include a sensing means 
connected to the signal generating means. A particular 
application of the invention is the detection of the 
presence of liquid as defined below. In other words, 
the occurrence of the event
