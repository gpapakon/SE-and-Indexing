<ABSTRACT>
A data acquisition system, e.g. a tachograph, is described which is capable of automatically detecting that the speed sensor signals (101) have been tampered with and indicating this as a report (61), and if appropriate initiating measures, by means of an acceleration sensor (2) which measures in the direction of travel of the vehicle and by means of corresponding evaluation of the acceleration sensor signal (201) and comparison with the recorded speed sensor signals (101).

Data acquisition system for vehicles with an electronic storage medium (4), a
time-controlled microprocessor (3) for calculating the distance and speed from

signals v (101) from the speed sensor (1) which are recorded continuously over
a certain period of time,
characterised by the fact
that to verify the speed sensor signals v (101) an acceleration meter (2) is
installed in the direction of travel whose measurement signals a (201) are

recorded continuously over a certain period of time,
that the speed differential Δv
W1
 (111) is calculated continuously using the
speed signals v (101) from the speed sensor from the start to the end of an

initial defined time interval Δt
1
 (511),
that the measurement signal a (20 1) from the acceleration sensor (2) over the
same time interval Δt
1
 (511) is integrated to the differential specd Δv
B1
 for this
time interval,
that when calculating a speed differential Δv
W1
 (111) the differential speed Δ
v
B1
 (211) for this time interval is set to zero for the calculation as an offset
correction 0
1
 (921) of the measurement signal a (201) from the acceleration
sensor (2) by inserting a correct value k
1
 (911),
that the time interval Δt
1
 (511) is followed by a second defined time interval Δ
t
2
 (512) within which the measurement signals a (201) from the acceleration
sensor (2) are integrated, taking into account the previous offset correction 0
1

(921) to the differential speed Δv
B2
 (212) and this is compared to the speed
differential Δv
w2
 (112) found using the speed sensor signals v (101) from the
start to the end of the same defined time interval Δt
2
 (512) and the result is
marked as a deviation A (930),
and that the deviation A (930), in the event that a defined maximum value A
max

(939) is exceeded, is saved for further processing in the storage medium (4)
and or a message is triggered.
Data acquisition system as described in claim 1,

max

speed sensor (1).
Data acquisition system as described in claim 1 or 2,

tmin
 (5 16)
and Δ
tmax

Data acquisition system as described in claim 3,
characterised by the fact

3
 (513), as in the first time interval Δt
1

3
 (923) is found for the measurement signal a
(201) from the acceleration sensor (2),
and that the mean value O
mitt
 (925) of the offset correction O
1,3
 (921,923) for
the acceleration sensor signal a (201) from the first and third time intervals Δt
1

(511), Δt
3
 (513) is taken as a basis to increase the determination accuracy of
the deviation A (930).
