<ABSTRACT>
In the case of theft of electronic apparatuses which are preferably installed in motor vehicles, in order to prevent the anti-theft security device being outwitted by the apparatus being connected to a replacement electrical power source immediately after being disconnected from the power supply network, positive discharge (forcible discharge) circuits are used according to the prior art, which immediately discharge the charge capacitor in the apparatus in the event of failure of the operating voltage and at the same time activate the anti-theft protection device. These circuits are relatively complex (costly) and are not sufficiently secure against manipulation. With the circuit arrangement according to the invention, microcomputer-controlled monitoring of the operating voltage is disclosed, which monitoring is essentially based on assemblies which are already present in apparatuses and therefore represents a very cost-effective solution.

Activation circuit for triggering a code-protected anti-theft 
device by evaluating the voltage drop at the 

battery or power supply terminals of a unit to be 
protected after the power supply has been disconnected, 

having a microprocessor (2) to control the security 
functions and the functions of the unit, and having one 

or more rapid discharge circuits with a charging 
capacitor (C), 
characterised in that
a) the microprocessor (2) cyclically interrogates the 
instantaneous value of the operating voltage (U
B
) via 
a voltage divider (R
1
, R
2
) and an analogue/digital 
input (A/D), and from each of the instantaneous 

values thus determined generates a time-averaged 
value which is effective for an initial time 

interval (T
1
) and continuously compares this value 
with the instantaneous values, 
b) in the event of a continuous reduction in the 
instantaneous values in relation to the time-averaged 

value within a second time interval (T
2
) 
while a predetermined gradient is maintained, the 

microprocessor (2) activates one or more discharge 
circuits (L
1
 ... L
n
) in order to rapidly discharge 
the charging capacitor (C), provided no recharging 

occurs via the operating voltage terminals, and 
c) the microprocessor (2) triggers the blocking of the 
unit's functions if the operating voltage (U
B
) fed 
via the voltage divider R
1
, R
2
 to the 
analogue/digital converter input (A/D) of the 

microprocessor falls below a specific trigger 
threshold within a predetermined third time interval 

(T
3
) from the time of the activation of the discharge 
circuits. 
Activation circuit according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that in the event of a manipulated, slow reduction of the 

operating voltage (U
B
), the microprocessor (2) 
continuously increases the trigger threshold to activate 

the security function so that the theft mode is triggered 
before the lower limit of the supply voltage (U
C
) required 
for the proper functioning of the microprocessor is 

reached. 
Activation circuit according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that in the event of a steep reduction 

in the operating voltage (U
B
) to a value other than zero 
volts, the microcomputer (2) increases the trigger 

threshold for activating the security mode so that, 
depending on the value of the remaining operating voltage 

(U
B
), either the anti-theft lockout is immediately 
activated on the expiry of the second and third time 

intervals (T
2
, T
3
), or in the event of a subsequent, 

further reduction in the operating voltage (U
B
), the anti-theft 
device rapidly responds. 
Activation circuit according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that if the operating voltage 

(U
B
) fed via the voltage divider (R
1
, R
2
) to the 
analogue/digital converter input (A/D) falls below a 

predetermined limit, the amplifier responsible for the 
audible playback is muted.
