<ABSTRACT>
In vitro treatment of a kidney prior to transplantation into a human recipient to reduce the risk of rejection, comprises perfusing the kidney with a solution of antibody specific to passenger leukocytes (e.g. anti-CD45 antibody) under cold ischaemia (CI) conditions with the renal vein occluded, and incubating the perfused kidney under CI conditions for at least 20 minutes. The volume of perfusion liquid is preferably at least 50 ml and the concentration of mAb about 40  mu g/ml or more. This has been found to increase mAb uptake by the target cells and the extent of mAb saturation of the target cells, and seems to be associated with a reduced incidence of graft rejection.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IN VITRO ANTIBODY PERFUSION OF KIDNEY GRAFTSThis invention relates to the treatment of kidney grafts to reduce the risk of rejection. More particularly it relates to the perfusion of kidneys in vitro with a liquid containing antibodies directed against passenger leukocytes in the kidney.The broad concept is disclosed in our International Patent Application PCT/GB90/01621, with respect to the in vitro perfusion of kidneys with liquid containing a lytic pair of anti-CD45 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). That was based on the work reported in Brewer et al 19891 who reported on a blind trial in which patients received first cadaver kidney allografts that had been perfused with a pair of complement-fixing rat anti-CD45 mAbs, in an attempt to reduce the immunogenicity of passenger leukocytes.The technique reported involved the preparation of vials containing 2 mg of each antibody in 2 ml phosphate buffered saline. The allograft was prepared for transplantation by standard method. The renal veins were clamped and the contents of the vial in 50 ml Marshall's solution at 4°C were injected into the renal arteries.About 20 minutes later, when the arteries and veins had been anastomosed, the clamps were removed and the transplant operation was completed in the usual way.Biopsy specimens were taken from the majority of transplants prior to wound closure and used to measure allograft uptake of anti-CD45 mAbs. The authors reported that the perfusion technique needs to be improved, as at least 25% of the grafts were poorly perfused with an antibody uptake of less than 50%.In a similar report by Brewer et al 19892 only 39% of the grafts had an antibody uptake of more than 75%. 62% of the grafts had an uptake of more than 50% and 38% had an uptake of less than 50%. This reference2 purportedly used an antibody perfusion technique as described in Taube et al 19875. This earlier Taube et al reference, did not document antibody uptake, although it referred to the injection of 

 2mg of a single mouse monoclonal antibody (F10-89-4) against leukocyte common antigen in 100 ml preservation medium. Following injection of the antibody, the kidney was allowed to incubate for 20 minutes. However, the later Brewer et al reference2 also concerned the injection of a pair of rat lgG2b anti-leukocyte common antigen antibodies YTH 24.5 and YTH 54.12. Therefore, it is not clear whether in Brewer et al each antibody separately or the antibodies in total were injected in accordance with the teaching of Taube et al 1987.Nevertheless these

 Claims
1. A method of in vitro treatment of a kidney prior to transplantation into a human recipient, which comprises perfusing the kidney with a liquid containing antibody specific to passenger leukocytes, wherein the liquid is injected into the vasculature of the kidney with the outlet veins occluded whereby a hydrostatic pressure is produced in the kidney, both the kidney and the injecting liquid being at a temperature appropriate to cold ischaemia, the perfused kidney being incubated under cold ischaemia conditions for at least 20 minutes.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein said antibody is monoclonal antibody.
3. A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the CI incubation time of the perfused kidney is at least 40 minutes.
4. A method according to claim 3 wherein the CI incubation time of the perfused kidney is at least one hour.
5. A method according to claim 1 wherein the incubation time of the perfused kidney is at least 40 minutes prior to anastomosis. 


 6. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the volume of liquid and the concentration of antibody are selected for achieving antibody uptake by at least 80% of the passenger leukocytes.
7. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the volume of liquid is greater than 25 ml.
8. A method according to claim 7 wherein the volume of liquid is at least 50 ml.
9. A method according to claim 8 wherein the volume of liquid is about 100 ml.
10. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the concentration of leukocyte specific antibody is greater than 20 μg/ml.
11. A method according to claim 10 wherein the concentration of leukocyte antibody is at least about 40 μg/ml.
12. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the volume of liquid, the concentration of antibody and the incubation time are selected for achieving a median saturation level of the target cells by the antibody of at least about 4 on a scale of 1-5 as visually assessed after double immunolabelling by EIA, wherein value 1 represents 


 no observable binding of the cell by the antibody, and value 5 represents apparently saturated binding of the cell by the antibody.
13. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the antibody is specific to CD45.
14. A method according to claim 12 wherein the antibody is capable of complement mediated cell lysis.
15. A method according to claim 13 wherein the antibody comprises a pair of anti-CD45 monoclonals which together are capable of complement mediated cell lysis, but individually are not lytic.
16. A method according to claim 14 wherein the antibodies are monoclonal antibodies YTH 24.5 and YTH 54.12.
