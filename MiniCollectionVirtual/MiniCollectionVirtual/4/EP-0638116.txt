<ABSTRACT>
As a lubricant for cold-working of metal there is provided on the surface of the metal to be subjected to working a solid film of a saturated aliphatic monohydric alcohol having 14 to 18 carbon atoms. After the metal has been worked, the solid lubricant may be removed by heating without causing staining of the metal surface. The solid lubricant film may additionally contain from 1 to 10 % by weight of a polybutene, petroleum jelly or butyl stearate to modify the properties of the lubricant film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to non-staining
solid lubricants suitable for use in metal working
operations, for instance in cold-rolling, drawing or
extrusion of metals, especially aluminium.Lubricants, usually liquid lubricants, are
used in metal working operations to reduce friction
between the surface of metal being worked and a
surface of the apparatus carrying out the operation.
A liquid lubricant reduces friction by separating the
two surfaces with a thin fluid film having little
resistance to shear. In many metal working operations
the pressure between a surface of the metal being
worked and a surface of the apparatus is so great that
the fluid film of a liquid lubricant may be squeezed
out so allowing actual metal-to-metal contact with the
result that excessive damage to the surfaces may
occur. Solid film lubricants having much greater load
bearing properties have been developed to overcome
this and other disadvantages associated with liquid
lubricants.In addition to its lubrication
characteristics, a lubricant may be expected to fulfil
certain other requirements if it is to be useful
industrially. For instance, it should be easy to
apply and easy to remove, it should afford some
protection to the metal surface during handling and
storage, it should present no health hazard to persons
coming into contact with it and, obviously, should be
inert to the surfaces with which it comes into
contact. Many lubricants produce severe stains on the
surface of the metal during annealing thereof. It is,
therefore, highly desirable to avoid such staining by
using a lubricant having the properties demanded by 
the particular conditions under which the lubricated metal is to be worked and which
is also non-staining.The present invention is based on the discovery that a solid film of one or
more saturated aliphatic monohydric alcohols having from 14 to 18 carbon atoms
provided on the surface of the metal being worked has good lubrication
characteristics under cold-working conditions and can be removed by heating to
leave substantially no stain on the metal surface.The present invention provides a method of cold forming a metal workpiece
comprising providing on the surface of the workpiece to be subjected to forming a
film of a lubricant, subjecting the workpiece to a forming operation and removing
the film of lubricant from the metal surface characterised in that the lubricant film
comprises a solid film of a saturated aliphatic monohydric alcohol having from 14 to
18 carbon atoms and in that the lubricant film
