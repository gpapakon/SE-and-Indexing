<ABSTRACT>
A POS (Point Of Sales) system which employs a 
purchased commodity accommodating and transporting 

apparatus having a self scanning function is improved in 
that a total amount of money for commodities loaded on a 

shopping cart or in a shopping basket or unit prices of 
the individual commodities can come to a knowledge of a 

customer before the commodities are transported to a 
settlement POS terminal thereby to prevent possible 

shopping of an amount of money greater than an estimate 
to allow smooth shopping and that commodities are 

printed in a sorted condition for different groups to 
facilitate confirmation of purchased commodities by a 

customer. A display section (7) is provided on the 
purchased commodity accommodating and transporting 

apparatus (3) and displays the prices of commodities 
obtained by retrieval of a commodity price file (4) in 

accordance with commodity code information read by a 
commodity code reading section (1) and a total value of 

the prices of the commodities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a POS system which
employs a purchased commodity accommodating and
transporting apparatus having a self scanning function
such as a shopping cart (hand cart) or a shopping basket
for use in the distribution industry, particularly in a
mass sales store, a convenience store or a
supermarket to allow a customer to accommodate and
transport a purchased commodity in order to purchase the
commodity while the customer itself reads a commodity
code such as a bar code applied to the commodity.Generally, a POS system is employed in various
stores such as supermarkets and convenience stores. In
the POS system, a customer walks around in a store
pushing a shopping cart or carrying a shopping basket,
places commodities to be purchased into the shopping
cart or the shopping basket, and comes to a settlement
POS terminal (POS register).Then at the settlement POS terminal, an operator
takes out the commodities one by one from the shopping
cart or the shopping basket and reads the bar codes
(commodity codes) applied to the commodities by means of 
a scanner to effect registration processing. In
particular, in accordance with commodity code
information read from each bar code, the price of the
commodity corresponding to the commodity code is
retrieved from a commodity price file (PLU (Price Look
Up) file), and a total amount of money of the purchased
commodities is calculated to settle the accounts.With such POS system, however, since an operator
must perform a reading operation of a commodity code of
each commodity, much time is required for such reading
operation and a settling operation, which causes the
customer to wait for a long time. Accordingly, in a
time band in which customers are crowded, a queue of
customers is produced in front of a settlement POS
terminal, and besides, the burden on the operator is
heavy.Thus, in recent years, a shopping cart (scanning
cart) or a shopping basket having a scanner (commodity
code reading section) for reading a bar code (commodity
code) applied to a commodity has been developed and are
disclosed in various publications including, for
example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Applications No.
Showa 63-145591, No. Heisei 2-277412 and No. Heisei 5-81559.In a POS system which employs a shopping cart or
a shopping basket of the type mentioned, a customer
itself reads a bar code applied to a commodity to be 
purchased by means of the scanner to register the
commodity code information and places or accommodates
the commodity into an accommodating section of the
shop
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A point of sale (POS) system, comprising

   a purchased commodity accommodating and
transporting apparatus (3) having a self scanning

function and including a commodity code reading section
