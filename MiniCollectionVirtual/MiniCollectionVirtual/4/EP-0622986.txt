<ABSTRACT>
A crop stripper has at least one drum (6a, 6b) with several axially extending series of stripping teeth (8). The drum is rotatably in end supports. The tooth roots (26) at the ends of the drum have an edge profile inclined radially away from the adjacent supports to deflect plant stems which contact these profiles during the operation of the stripper away from the supports, so reducing the tendency for the stems to become trapped between rotor and support. A capping (32) on the support overlaps the adjacent tooth roots to assist this effect. A pair of drums can be arranged end to end with an intermediate support (14) between them and be similarly arranged to deflect plant stems away from the intermediate support. This allows increase of the operating width of the crop stripper while minimizing the risk of blockage from stems trapped between the intermediate support and the drums.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to crop strippers for
detaching and harvesting standing crops, such as grain or
flowers or herbage.Typically such strippers comprise a rotary
carrier in the form of a drum which carries axially
extending series of teeth which, as the stripper is
advanced through the crop, strip desired parts such as
grain, leaves or blossom from stems of the crop.In a crop stripper as described in WO86/01972,
the drum is mounted between side support plates. The teeth
on the drum have a symmetrical profile tapering to a point at
the outer tip, but at the ends of the drum there are half-width
teeth in which the median radial axis of the
symmetrical full-tooth profile defines the edge of the end
tooth facing the adjacent side support plate. Having the
same height as the other teeth, these thinner end teeth are
relatively easily deflected or deformed. Furthermore,
between the side support plates and the teeth there must be
a significant running clearance, allowing plant stems to
enter between the teeth and the side support plate with
the risk that they become wedged there, and possibly wrap
around the drum shaft.According to one aspect of the invention, a crop
stripper comprising a rotary carrier having an axially
extending series of stripping teeth and supports for the
carrier at the ends of the carrier has the support at least 
at one end of the carrier flanked by root portions of the
stripping teeth most adjacent the support and is provided
with an axially projecting element radially outwardly of
the nearest ends of said flanking tooth root portions, the
edge profile of said root portions in a region of their
extent nearer said support being inclined radially inwardly
away from the support whereby crop stems contacting said
root portion profiles in said region are deflected away
from the support.Crop strippers are made in a range of sizes and
in another of its aspects the present invention is
concerned particularly with multiple drum strippers in
which a rotor is divided into at least two carriers or
drums arranged coaxially side by side, e.g. in order to
increase the overall width of the rotor, and a bearing
support separates the adjacent ends of the drums.The bearing support takes the form of a plate
fixed to a casing of the stripper, and it is not possible
to avoid a running gap or clearance in this region. There
is therefore a tendency for the plant stems to become
wedged between the drums and the support, leading to a
blockage.According to another aspect of the invention, in
a crop stripper

<CLAIMS>
A crop stripper comprising a rotary carrier (6a

or 6b) having an axially extending series of stripping
teeth (8,20) and supports (2a or 14) for the carrier at the

ends of the carrier, wherein at least the
support at one end of the carrier is flanked by root

portions (36) of the stripping teeth (20 or 20') most
adjacent the support and is provided with an axially

projecting element (30 or 32a) radially outwardly of the
nearest ends of said flanking tooth root portions (36), the

edge profile of said root portions in a region of their
extent nearer said support being inclined radially inwardly

away from the support whereby crop stems contacting said
root portion profiles in said region are deflected away

from the support.
A crop stripper according to claim 1 wherein said
rotary carrier (6a or 6b) is mounted in said supports (2a

or 14) at its opposite ends.
A crop stripper comprising a rotor (6) having at
least two rotary carriers (6a,6b) arranged coaxially side

by side, said carriers having axially extending series of
stripping teeth (8,20) projecting from them and a support

(14) for the rotor extending between said two carriers,
characterised in that the support (14) is flanked by root

portions (36) of the stripping teeth most adjacent each 
side of the support, and is provided with an axially

projecting element (30) radially outwardly of the nearest
ends of said flanking tooth root portions (36), the edge

profiles of said root portions in their region nearer said
support being inclined radially inwardly away from the

support whereby crop stems contacting said root portion
profiles in said region are deflected away from the

support.
A crop stripper according to claim 3 wherein
there are end supports (2a) at opposite ends of the rotor

(6) and said end supports are both provided with axially
projecting elements (32a) extending in overlapping

relationship with root portions of the stripping teeth at the
adjacent ends of said carriers.
A crop stripper according to any one of the
preceding claims wherein the or each said axially

projecting element (30,32a) overlaps the end regions of the
tooth root portions flanking the associated support

(2a,14).
A crop stripper according to any one of the
preceding claims wherein the or each said axially

projecting element (30,32a) has a radially outer surface
(32) which is inclined radially inwardly towards the

adjacent stripper teeth.
A crop stripper according to claim 3 or claim 4 
together with claim 6 wherein said outer surface (32) of

the axially projecting element (30) on the support (14)
between the two carriers has a substantially V-form radial

cross-section which is inclined towards the teeth of the
respective carriers (6a,6b) on opposite sides of said

support.
A crop stripper according to any one of the
preceding claims wherein at least at one carrier end the

root portions of the teeth have a re-entrant profile which
forms bulbous gaps at the roots of the teeth and the

axially projecting element (30 or 32a) at said at least one
end lies within the radial extent of said re-entrant

profile of the tooth root portions.
A crop stripper according to any one of the
preceding claims wherein said stripper teeth (20 or 20')

most adjacent the or each support are offset towards the
support so that the tip of each said tooth (20 or 20') is

at a pitch from the tip of its neighbouring tooth (8) in
the associated axial series of teeth that is increased

relative to the pitch of the tips of intermediate teeth (8)
of said series.
