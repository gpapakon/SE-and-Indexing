<ABSTRACT>
A releasable catch for holding together the body (1) 
of a bag and a flap (2) of the bag includes a plug member (4) 

attached to the flap and having a resiliently deformable 
locking tongue (4b), and a socket member (3) attached at 

its one end to the bag body and having a gate-shaped locked 
portion (3a') disposed adjacent the one end of the socket 

member for slidably receiving and thereafter locking the 
resiliently deformable locking tongue (4b) to couple the plug 

member (4) and the socket member (3). The locking tongue (4b) 
is tilted toward a backward side of the plug member (4) at a 

predetermined angle (ϑ) relative to a plane of an attachment 
portion (3c). When the locking tongue (4b) of the plug member 

(4) is locked into the socket member (3), the bent plug member 
(4) tends to turn the socket member (3) about the fixed one 

end toward the bag body (1), so that the other or loose end of 
the socket member (3) is always held in contact with a front 

surface of the bag body (1) regardless of the content of the bag. 
The releasable catch thus constructed is sightly in appearance, 

can be manipulated reliably with utmost ease, and damages neither 
itself nor another article on impingement with the latter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clasp or releasable
catch for holding together two complementary parts of a
flexible article via interlocking engagement between a plug
member and a socket member, and more particularly to such a
releasable catch which can be coupled and uncoupled reliably
with utmost ease and does not damage itself or another
article in the coupled state.Bags, such as rucksacks, briefcases and the like,
of the type having a flap generally have a plug member
attached to the flap, and a socket member attached to a body
of the bag at an appropriate position where the plug member
is to be locked in the socket member. When some stuff is to
be put in or taken out from the bag, as a front side of the
plug member is depressed, a locking tongue of the plug member
is brought into and out of interlocking engagement with a
gate-shaped locked portion of the socket member for closing
and opening the flap.The plug member includes an attachment portion 
attached to the flap and a locking tongue adapted to be
locked in and released from the socket member. The locking
tongue is provided with a resilient locking portion normally
projecting from a front surface of the locking tongue. When
the front side of the locking tongue is depressed, the
locking portion retracts into the locking tongue. Conversely,
when the pressure on the locking tongue is released, the
locking portion resiliently projects again from the front
surface of the locking tongue.When the flap is to be caught on the body of the
bag, the locking tongue of the plug member attached to the
flap is forced into the gate-shaped locked portion of the
socket member attached to the bag body. In this instance,
the resilient locking portion of the locking tongue is
depressed by the gate-shaped locked portion against the
resiliency thereof and retracts into the locking tongue. A
continued advancing movement of the locking tongue causes
the resilient locking portion to move past the gate-shaped
locked portion of the socket member whereupon the resilient
locking portion springs back into its initial, projecting
position and is thereby interlocked with the gate-shaped
locked portion. On the other hand, when the flap is to be
detached from the bag body, the plug member is pulled out
to remove the locking tongue from the gate-shaped locked
portion of the socket member while the resilient locking 
portion of the locking tongue is being manually depressed
against the resiliency thereof. To achieve this uncoupling
operation, the resilient locking portion must
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A releasable catch for holding together first and second
flexible parts (2, 1) of an article, which includes: a plug

member (4) including an attachment portion (4a) adapted to be
attached to the first flexible part (2) of the article, and a

locking tongue (4b) connected to said attachment portion (4a)
through a resilient root portion (4d) so as to be resiliently

deformable about said root portion (4d) when depressed by a
force applied from a front side of said plug member (4); and a

socket member (3) including a flat base plate (3a), a gate-shaped
locked portion (3a') disposed on a front surface of said

flat base plate (3a) adjacent an upper end thereof for slidably
receiving therein said locking tongue (4b) to lock the same in

said socket member (3), and an attachment portion (3c) disposed
at said upper end of said flat base plate (3) and adapted to be

attached to the second flexible part (1) of the article,
characterised in that said locking tongue (4b) is bent about

the resilient root portion (4d) toward a backward side of said
plug member (4) at a predetermined angle () relative to a

plane of said attachment portion (4a). 
A releasable catch according to claim 1, wherein
said predetermined angle () of bend is in the range of

20 to 40 degrees.
A releasable catch according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein said socket member (3) further includes a spacer portion

(3d) disposed between said flat base plate (3a) and said
attachment portion (3c) to space apart said flat base plate

(3a) and said attachment portion (3c) by a distance, said
attachment portion (3c) extending from said upper end toward

a lower end opposite to said upper end at an angle relative
to said flat base plate (3a) such that the distance between

said flat base plate (3a) and said attachment portion (3c)
decreases progressively in a direction away from said spacer

portion (3d).
