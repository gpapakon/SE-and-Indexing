<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of iron from ferrous raw 
materials in a converter containing an initial iron smelt 

into which at least fuels, oxygenous gases and ferrous raw 
materials are introduced during the production phase, the 

reaction gases being afterburned with oxidizing gases in 
the gas space of the converter above the smelt and the 

resulting heat transferred to the iron bath, and a partial 
amount of iron smelt being tapped after the production 

phase and a next initial iron smelt remaining in the 
converter for the next production phase, wherein the weight 

of the initial iron smelt is between 10 % and 60 % , based 
on the weigth of the iron smelt present in the converter 

after the production phase and before the partial amount is 
tapped, and the ferrous raw materials are fed continuously 

to the iron smelt through the gas space of the converter 
during the production phase while at the same time 

oxygenous gases containing no more than 50 % oxygen are 
blown continuously onto the surface of the smelt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of iron
from ferrous raw materials in a converter containing an initial iron smelt into
which at least fuels, oxygenous gases and ferrous raw materials are
introduced during the production phase, the reaction gases being
afterburned with oxidizing gases in the gas space of the converter above the
smelt and the resulting heat transferred to the iron bath, and a partial
amount of iron smelt being tapped after the production phase and a next
initial iron smelt remaining in the converter for the next production phase.Current developments in the iron and steel industry with respect to
ironmaking are directed mainly to coke-free metallurgy. In futuristic smelting
reduction methods which start out with iron ore for ironmaking, coal is used
instead of coke as an energy carrier and reducing agent. Another way of
melting iron is to use ferriferous raw materials, for example scrap, and to
adjust the desired carbon content for the tap of the smelt by likewise using
carbonaceous fuels. This latter method also includes measures for increasing
the scrap smelting capacity in steelmaking.A synoptic description of smelting reduction methods mainly in the
pilot stage can be found in the publication "Entwicklungslinien der
Schmelzreduktion", Stahl und Eisen 109 (1989), no. 16, pages 728 to 742.
Smelting reduction methods generally work with a melt-down gasifier in
which coal and oxygen are fed to the iron smelt to compensate the energy
balance, and the resulting reaction gases CO and H2 are then used in a
preceding ore reduction facility to reduce the iron ores completely or
partially. This prereduced material is then fed directly to the melt-down
gasifier in most cases. Only the Hlsmelt process works with a high 
afterburning rate of the reaction gases in the free gas space of the smelting
reduction vessel and thus has a particularly favorable energy balance
without a high surplus of high-energy waste gas.The article "Stand der Verfahrenstechnik für das Einschmelzen von
Schrott mit fossiler Energie", Stahl und Eisen 110 (1990), no. 7, pages 109
to 116, describes various possibilities of using fossil energy carriers to
increase the smelting capacity of scrap in steelmaking. This publication
explains not only the application of different burner systems and scrap
preheating methods but also the afterburning of reaction gases to improve
the thermal balance.German patent no. 36 07 777 relates to a process for making steel
from scrap in a refining vessel wherein
