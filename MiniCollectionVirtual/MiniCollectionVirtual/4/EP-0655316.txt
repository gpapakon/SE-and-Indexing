<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a process for creating a watermark on a 
polymeric sheet (1) by (a) passing the sheet between 

two rollers (A,10) in 
abutment with each other, at least one of which bears hollow or in 

relief motifs so as to form an impression corresponding to the motif 
on the passing sheet. The impressioned sheet is then oriented by 

stretching such that the oriented sheet, under transmitted light, 
exhibits an impression of the motif which is light and dark in areas 

corresponding respectively to the in relief and the hollow portions 
of the motif on the roller. The watermarks can be used on documents 

which need a degree of security such as eg deeds, identity cards, 
passports and bank notes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of placing a watermark on eg
documents, securities or currency made from synthetic paper which
mark is visible under transmitted light.It is well known to introduce water marks on paper. The
application of watermarks has hitherto been done in a variety of
ways. One such method is to form the watermarks during the
manufacture of the paper by means of round moulds bearing impressions
which are hollow and/or in relief, with the aid of watermarking
rollers bearing designs which are hollow and/or in relief, associated
with a flat table (Fourdrinier machine). This method then makes it
possible to obtain an image which, when the sheet of paper is viewed
in transmitted light, appears either as a light impression (when
using a roller with a relief design) or as a dark impression (when
using a roller with a hollow design). The clear areas are due to the
fact that the thickness of the sheet and the density of the fibres
are less than the thickness of the sheet and the corresponding areas
where the roller has not left an impression.A further method is to create pseudo-watermarks by printing or
depositing a compound, generally greasy, which renders the sheet of
paper permanently transparent. The transparent effect can equally
well be created by means of a heat-fusible material such as
polyethylene as described in EP-A-203499. In the latter reference,
the pseudo-watermark is applied to a sheet of paper which comprises a
thermally sensitive material, and heat is applied to a part of the
surface of the paper in a manner to cause a region of the paper to 
become irreversibly translucent.Yet another method of creating a watermark on a sheet of paper
is to control the opacity of pre-defined areas of the paper using an
opacifier. FR-A-2353676 describes such a process. The opacifier
may be an aqueous suspension of a pigment or other chemical compound
which in turn may be a coloured compound or an ink. The opacifier
is applied during the manufacture of the sheet, on the fibrous nap
and before it is raised from the backcloth, in such a manner that
said opacifier penetrates into the interstices of the nap at pre-defined
areas, thereby changing the opacity thereof upon drying.
This technique has the disadvantage that it requires special roller
arrangements to apply the opacifier and equipment to enable the
opacifier to penetrate the nap interstices.Again US-A-4520063 describes a sheet made of synthetic resin
containing security markings which are similar to watermarks. Two

A process for creating a watermark on a sheet of polymeric
material, said process comprising


a. passing the sheet between two rollers in abutment with each
other and wherein at least one of the rollers bears motifs

which are hollow and/or in relief so as to form an impression
on the passing sheet which impression corresponds to the hollow

and/or in relief motifs on said roller(s), and
b. orienting by stretching the sheet so impressioned such that
when viewed in a transmitted light, the oriented sheet exhibits an

impression of the motif which is dark in areas corresponding to the
in relief portions and light in areas corresponding to the hollow

portions of the motifs on said roller(s).
A process according to Claim 1 wherein the sheet of polymeric
material to be stretched and/or oriented is a film.
A process according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein the sheet comprises
at least one polyolefin.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein
the polymeric film or sheet is formed by extrusion or callendering.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein
the sheets are produced by extrusion of compositions consisting

primarily of polyethylene and used for producing polyolefin based
synthetic papers.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein
the composition which is extruded into sheets comprises the following

components: 

Component
Parts by weight
High density polyethylene (copolymer)
100
Calcium-zinc resinate
5-15
Polystyrene
4.5-5.5

0.4-1.0
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein
the sheet, after stretching and/or orientation is subjected to prior

chemical or corona discharge treatment on the surface thereof to
improve its receptivity to print or other coating that may be applied

thereon.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein,
after orientation, a coating is applied on the impressioned sheet

while ensuring that the impression remains visible.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein the
coating is that of a pigmented compound whic
h may be a coloured and/or
fluorescent compound and which compound is capable of being printed upon.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein
the watermark is applied to the sheet before applying the coating

thereon.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein
the hollows and/or in reliefs forming the motif(s) are present on the

surface of only one of the rollers which is of a smaller diameter
than the other roller in abutment therewith.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein
the temperature of the rollers varies in the range from ambient to a

temperature about 5Â°C above the machine temperature.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein
the orientation of the sheet is carried out by stretching said sheet

in the machine direction, in the transverse direction or biaxial in
both directions.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims wherein 
the orientation of the sheet is by biaxial stretching in a stretch

ratio from 2:1 to 10:1 in the machine direction and from 3:1 to 6:1
in the transverse direction.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims 11 or 12
wherein the biaxial stretching is carried out sequentially or
