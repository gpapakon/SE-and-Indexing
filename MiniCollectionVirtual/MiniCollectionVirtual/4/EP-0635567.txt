<ABSTRACT>
A method of facilitating the removal of soil 
contaminants from a solid surface is provided which 

method comprises washing the surface with a liquid 
composition characterised in that the liquid 

composition comprises a material which is deposited on 
the surface during washing and upon drying forms a 

layer adhered to the surface, said material having a 
cohesive strength such that at least the outermost 

surface portion of the layer is removable by further 
washing. The low cohesive strength material may be 

incorporated in a composition for cleaning solid 
surfaces e.g. a bathroom cleaner for removing 

contaminants such as soap scum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and 
composition for facilitating the removal of soil 
contaminants from solid surfaces e.g. the removal of 
soap scum from bathroom hard surfaces such as ceramic 
tiles. Known methods for facilitating the removal 
of soil contaminants from a solid surface have 
involved treating the surface to render it less prone 
to soil adhesion. For example, FR-A-2 639 353 
describes coating a solid surface with a composition 
comprising a mixture of polymers to render the surface 
waterproof, oil-resistant, stain-resistant and self-cleaning. A shortcoming of this approach is that the 
nature of the adhesive bond between a soil contaminant 
and the surface varies depending on the composition of 
the contaminant. For example, adhesion could result 
from electrostatic, dispersion, dipole/dipole, 
hydrophobic or hydrogen bond interactions as well as 
from rugosity effects. For contaminants which are a 
mixture of different components, adhesion usually 
occurs through a number of different adhesive bonds. 
Furthermore, solid surfaces are rarely, if ever, 
smooth and soil contamination can occur by physical 
entrapment. By way of example, the composition of soap 
scum which is a common bathroom soil is a mixture of 
ionic, hydrophilic and hydrophobic components. Hence, 
a scum could form a variety of adhesive bonds to  
 
typical household hard surfaces such as metals, 
plastics, ceramics, glass and glazed surfaces. It can be seen that chemically modifying a 
surface to reduce soiling will only be effective in 
respect of certain soil contaminants and is unlikely 
to be very effective against complex mixtures such as 
soap scums. An object of the invention is to provide a 
method of facilitating the removal of soil 
contaminants from a solid surface which does not 
require chemically modifying the surface to render it 
less prone to soil adhesion. In accordance with the invention there is 
provided a method of facilitating the removal of soil 
contaminants from a solid surface which method 
comprises washing the surface with a liquid 
composition characterised in that the liquid 
composition comprises a material which is deposited on 
the surface during washing and upon drying forms a 
layer adhered to the surface, said material having a 
cohesive strength such that at least the outermost 
surface portion of the layer is removable by further 
washing. In accordance with another aspect of the 
invention there is provided a liquid composition for 
cleaning solid surfaces comprising one or
