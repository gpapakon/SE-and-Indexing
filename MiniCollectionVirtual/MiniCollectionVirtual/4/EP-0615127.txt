<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sample loaders and,
more particularly, to an automatic sample loader for a
horizontal analytical furnace.Horizontal analytic furnaces are well known. An
example of such a furnace is described in US-A-5
064 617 entitled COMBUSTION SYSTEM issued to O'Brien et
al. on November 12, 1991. These furnaces are typically
manually loaded with a sample. However, manual loading
is time consuming and uncomfortable for the loader due to
the high temperature within the combustion furnace and
the high temperature of sample containers which are
removed from the furnace.Automatic sample loaders are known which
mechanically load samples into an analytical combustion
furnace. However, such loaders do not adequately seal
the furnace following introduction of a sample.
Accordingly, atmospheric contaminants such as nitrogen
enter into the furnace and detrimentally affect the
results of the analysis performed using the analytical
furnace. Additionally, these automatic loaders do not
adequately provide for loading of sample containers and
unloading hot spent containers.The system of the present invention overcomes the
difficulties encountered by the prior art.According to one aspect of the present invention a
sample loader for a horizontal analytical combustion
furnace comprises: a frame for attachment to a horizontal
combustion furnace comprising an end plate having an
aperture therein; at least one first guide rail extending
from said end plate; a carriage movably supported on said
at least one guide rail, said carriage comprising a
furnace sealing member having an aperture therein and an 
end member joined together by at least one side member;
a closure member for said aperture in said furnace
sealing member; reversible means for moving said furnace
sealing member into a sealing position and for moving
said seal member away from said sealing position; a
rotary actuator member; a support member for said rotary
actuator member movably mounted on said at least one
guide rail; a boat retrieval rod operatively connected to
said rotary actuator and extending through said closure
member into said furnace seal member; and a motor mounted
on said carriage for reversibly moving said support
member for said rotary actuator.According to another aspect of the present invention
a sample loader for a horizontal analytical combustion
furnace comprises a frame for attachment to the
horizontal combustion furnace; a furnace seal member
having an aperture therein movably supported on said
frame; a closure member
