<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of semiconductors, and 
more particularly, to a method for producing a precise alloy composition from input 
variables under nonlinear incorporation conditions. In order to manufacture binary or ternary alloy compositions, practitioners 
consult metallurgy tables to determine the proportions of the constituent elements. 
A typically metallurgy table will indicate the number of moles of the constituent 
elements (also called input variables) required to produce the desired alloy 
composition. For a binary alloy composition having 50% of each input variables, the 
metallurgy table may indicate an equal number of moles for each. Processes in 
which the input variables are added in amounts that are equal in percentage to the 
amount of those input variables in the resulting alloy composition are called linear 
incorporations. These linear incorporations have been characterized for many 
decades according to a theorem called Vegard's law. Vegard's law is a well known relationship governing solid state compositions. 
For a binary alloy AB, where the composition of variable A is cA and the 
composition of variable B is cB, Vegard's law simply describes the composition for 
variable A as: cA=fA/(fA+fB). Here, fA and fB represent the input fluxes of the input 
variables A and B (e.g., the number of moles of the constituent elements A and B). 
The composition for variable B is thus expressed as: cB=1-cA. A graphical plot of 
an input fluxes fA or fB verses the alloy composition yields a linear relationship. Not 
all alloys, however, adhere to this linear relationship. Several Group III-V alloy 
systems are known to have a nonlinear relationship, particularly the ternary and 
quaternary alloys such as GaAsP, InAsP, InGaAsP, GaAsSb, InAsSb, GaInAsSb. To date, the composition of alloys which follow nonlinear incorporations (i.e., 
those that do not follow Vegard's law) has been unpredictable. The ability to even  
 
roughly predict the alloy composition based on the amounts of input variables, or the 
ability to predict the amounts of input variables based on the alloy composition, has 
not existed. As a result, Group II-V alloys are generally produced through an iterative, 
impractical process. Such techniques produce very low yield, and thus, are not cost 
effective. Many iterations of the manufacturing and testing cycle are required to 
produce devices possessing the desired electrical or optical characteristics (e.g., 
bandgap). Accordingly, much raw material
