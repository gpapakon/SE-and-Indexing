The present invention relates to naphthoxazines, their production, their use as 
pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. In particular the present invention provides compounds of formula I 
wherein 
R₁is (C₁₋₄)alkyl, (C₃₋₆)alkenyl, whereby the double bond is not in α-position to the 
nitrogen atom, or (C₃₋₇)cycloalkyl(C₁₋₂)alkyl, R₂is (C₁₋₄)alkoxy, (C₂₋₆)alkenyloxy or (C₃₋₇)cycloalkyl(C₁₋₂)alkoxy, and R₃is (C₁₋₄)alkylcarbonyl, (C₁₋₄)alkyl, α-hydroxy(C₁₋₄)alkyl, (C₂₋₅)alkenyl, 
(C₁₋₄)alkoxy(C₁₋₄)alkyl or (C₃₋₇)cycloalkyl,    in free base or acid addition salt form, hereinafter referred to as new compounds. The invention includes the racemic forms of the cis- and trans-isomers, which, on account 
of the asymmetrical carbon atoms, may be present in 4a- and 10a-position or within the 
substituent R₃, as well as the corresponding enantiomers. The above-defined alkyl or alkoxy groups contained in the new compounds preferably 
contain 1 or 2 carbon atoms and in particular represent methyl or methoxy. In one group of new compounds, R₁ is (C₁₋₄)alkyl. In another group, R₂ is (C₁₋₄)alkoxy.  In a further group, R₃ is (C₁₋₄)alkylcarbonyl, (C₁₋₄)alkyl, α-hydroxy(C₁₋₄)alkyl, (C₂₋₅)alkenyl 
or (C₁₋₄)alkoxy(C₁₋₄)alkyl. In still a further group, R₁ is methyl, ethyl or propyl, R₂ is methoxy and R₃ is acetyl, 
ethylcarbonyl, α-hydroxyethyl, α-hydroxypropyl, α-methoxyethyl, α-hydroxy-α-methylethyl, 
α-hydroxy-α-methylpropyl, ethenyl, α-methylethenyl, 1-propenyl, 1-methyl-1-propenyl, 
ethyl or propyl. In accordance with the invention, the new compounds are obtained whereby 
a) in order to produce compounds of formula Ia 
 
   wherein R₁ and R₂ are as defined above, and R₃a is (C₁₋₄)alkylcarbonyl, compounds 
of formula II 
 
   wherein R₁ and R₂ are as defined above, are acylated in 9-position, or b) in order to produce compounds of formula Ib,   
   wherein R₁ and R₂ are as defined above and R₃b is (C₁₋₄)alkyl, α-hydroxy(C₁₋₄)alkyl,

are alkylated in 9-position, and, if desired, the compounds of formula I thus obtained are converted into their acid 
addition salts. The acylation according to process a) may be effected in known manner, e.g. by means of 
a reaction with an acyl halide as described in example 1. The alkylation according to progress b) may be effected in known manner, e.g. by means 
of a reaction with an alkyl halide. The process may also take place in two stages, whereby
