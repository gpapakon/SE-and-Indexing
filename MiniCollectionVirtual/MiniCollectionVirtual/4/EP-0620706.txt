<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE TABLET FORMULAΗON WITH INTERNAL DESICCANT γ An effervescent tablet produces gas bubbles by the reaction between an acid" 5 and a base. Should the water level in the tablet exceed about 0.1%, the tablet will* begin to lose its effervescence even though it is stored in its container. Normally, an amount of water exceeding 0.1% is required to formulate a tablet having acceptable integrity and strength.One way to keep the water employed during formulation from ruining the 10 tablet during long-term storage is to package the tablet with a desiccant. The water in the tablet diffuses out and is taken up by the desiccant. This water is held by the desiccant and so cannot cause the acid/base reaction to occur. However, the need for an external desiccant complicates design of the tablet package. 15 One such tablet formulation that does not have an internal desiccant is disclosed in WO 90/00007. Two formulations that contain an internal desiccant are disclosed in CA-A-2,013,918 and WO 88/09161. CA-A-2,013,918 discloses a tablet comprising potassium carbonate and/or potassium bicarbonate as bases and a desiccant which physically adsorbs water. WO 88/09161 discloses an 20 effervescent tablet for cleaning dentures comprising pancreatin, an acid component, a base component, and a drying agent.SUMMARY OF THE INNENTION This invention comprises a tablet formulation consisting essentially of by total weight of the formulated composition: 25 (i) about 0.1% to 75% of a pesticide;(ii) about 25% to 99.9% of a delivery system characterized by a panel of components complementary to the pesticide of (i) having the following components:(a) about 5% to 75% of a dibasic or tribasic organic carboxylic acid 30 or a mixture thereof;(b) about 5% to 75% of an ammonium, lithium, sodium or potassium » carbonate or bicarbonate or a mixture thereof; j (c) about 0.5% to 20% of a dispersant;(d) about 0.1% to 5% of water-insoluble cross-linked polyvinyl- 35 polypyrrolidone; 

 (e) about 0.1% to 5% of an anionic or nonionic wetting agent; and(f) about 1% to 20% of an internal desiccant being selected from the group:(A) one or a mixture of desiccants that chemically bind water, and (B) one or a mixture of desiccants that physically adsorb water; the desiccant being (A) when (b) is potassium carbonate or potassium bicarbonate.This delivery system is characterized by the inter-relationship of components (a) to (f) in the recited ranges to effect rapid disintegration of finely dispersed pesticide particles (i).
