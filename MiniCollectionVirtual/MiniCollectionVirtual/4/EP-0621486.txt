<ABSTRACT>
A probe (1-2) is attached to a support plate (1-1) 
vertically to the surface of the support plate. A drop 

of a molten metal is formed at a tip portion of the 
probe. The support plate has a heater (1-3) for setting 

the temperature of the probe and the drop of the molten 
metal at the tip portion of the probe. The probe is 

situated at a position corresponding to a position of 
an electrode of an LSI. The probe is connected to a 

measuring device (1-5) for evaluating characteristics of 
the LSI by wiring (1-4). The drop of the molten metal

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus 
for evaluating characteristics of an LSI and a 
method of evaluating characteristics of an LSI using the 
apparatus, and more particularly to an apparatus and a 
method for obtaining a contact between a probe and a 
signal take-out electrode of an LSI. In general, an LSI includes, as part of wiring, a 
pad (electrode) connected electrically to an external 
circuit, etc. The characteristics of the LSI can be 
evaluated by applying a signal to the LSI, with a probe 
made of tungsten, etc. put in contact with the pad of 
the LSI. FIG. 1 shows the state in which the probe is put in 
pressure contact with the pad of the LSI. A wiring material of the LSI is an alloy consisting 
mainly of aluminum. The surface of a pad 10-1 is 
covered with an aluminum oxide film 10-2. The oxide 
film 10-2 prevents electric conduction between the pad 
10-1 and a probe 10-3. In order to evaluate the characteristics 
of the LSI exactly, the oxide film 10-2 must 
be removed. There are two conventional methods (a) and (b) of 
removing the oxide film 10-2 and evaluating the characteristics 
of the LSI: 
(a) A method of mechanically removing an oxide  
 
film on the surface of a pad. 
As is shown in FIG. 2, a tip portion of the probe 
10-3 is put in pressure contact with the surface of the 
pad 10-1 at an angle less than 90°C. In this case, 
the tip portion moves over the surface of the pad 10-1 
under pressure produced by elasticity of the probe 10-3. 
As a result, the oxide film 10-2 adhered to the surface 
of the pad 10-1 is raked off by the moving probe 10-3. The method (a) makes use of elasticity of the probe 
10-3. Thus, if an excessive load is applied to the 
probe 10-3, the probe 10-3 slides and damages a protective 
insulating film 10-4 provided around the pad 10-1. 
In a worst case, the probe 10-3 destroys the pad 10-1 
itself. Since the probe 10-3 is situated at an angle to 
the surface of the pad 10-1, it is not possible to 
arrange probes at high density. In the case of an LSI 
having a plurality of pads arranged at a narrow pitch, 
it is difficult to evaluate the characteristics of the 
LSI. (b) A method of chemically attaining contact 
between a probe and a pad. 
This method adopts a mercury contact system 
employed widely in relays, etc. The electric conduction 
between the probe and the pad is attained through molten 
mercury (Hg). According to the method (b), mercury 
constitutes an amalgam with material of the pad (metal) 
and accordingly an oxide film on
