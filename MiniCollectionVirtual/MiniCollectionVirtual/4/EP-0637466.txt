<ABSTRACT>
Electrostatic powder-spraying device with a charging electrode (20) for the electrostatic charging of powder for the spray-coating of articles and with at least one counterelectrode (52) for the electrostatic extraction of free ions from the stream of sprayed powder. An electrical conduction path (60) for connecting the counterelectrode (52) to a different electrical potential from the charging electrode (20) contains a ring-contact connection (68). The powder-spraying device can be demounted in a simple way for cleaning and can also optionally be used without a counterelectrode (52).

An electrostatic powder spray apparatus including a body (4); a
powder duct (14) for pneumatically conveyed powder, which extends through

the body (4); a spray opening (18) at the downstream end of the powder duct
(14) for spraying the powder on to an article to be coated; at least one

charging electrode (20) for electrostatically charging the powder with
electrical high voltage in the proximity of the spray opening (18); at

least one counter-electrode (52) which is arranged at a spacing from the
charging electrode (20) radially outside the flow of powder; an electrical

conduction path (60) which extends from an electrical connecting element
(62) at a rear location on the body (4) which is upstream with respect to

the powder flow direction to the counter-electrode (52) and which can be
connected to an electrical potential by which the counter-electrode (52)

removes free ions from the flow of the sprayed powder by electrostatic
forces; the electrical conduction path (60) is divided into a rear

conduction portion (64) electrically connected to the electrical connecting
element (62) and a front conduction portion (66) electrically connected to

the counter-electrode (52); a sleeve (42) which can be fitted on to the
body (4) from the spray opening (18) and which can be removed and which is

provided with the counter-electrode (52) and the front conduction portion
(66); rotary connecting means (40, 41) on the body (4) and on the sleeve

(42), by which the sleeve (42) can be fixed to the body (4) by a rotary
movement and can be released from the body (4) again by ano
ther rotary
movement, wherein the rear conduction portion (64) and a non-rotatable

contact portion (72) electrically connected thereto are removably disposed
in the body (40) but the sleeve (42) beside the non-rotatable contact

portion (72) blocks removal as long as the sleeve is fixed to the body (4);
characterised in that the two conduction portions (64, 66) are releasably

electrically connected together by way of a ring contact device (68) which
has the non-rotatable contact portion (72) and a contact ring (70) which

contacts it and which surrounds the powder duct (14) at a radial spacing
and which is arranged rotatably around the powder duct (14) relative to the

non-rotatable contact portion (72) and which is electrically connected to 
the front conduction portion (66), and that the sleeve (42) is provided

with the contact ring (70).
An electrostatic powder spray apparatus according to claim 1
characterised in that there is provided a nozzle (10) forming the spray

opening (18) and that the sleeve (42) engages over the nozzle (10) and
holds it axially in a predetermined position between itself and the body

(4).
An electrostatic powder spray apparatus according to one of the
preceding claims characterised in that the sleeve (42) comprises at least

two tubes (80, 81) which are arranged coaxially one within the other and
which are non-rotatably connected to each other, and that between the two

tubes (80, 81) the front conduction portion (66) extends from the rotatable
contact ring (70) of the ring contact device (68) to the counter-electrode

(52).
An electrostatic powder spray apparatus according to one of the
preceding claims characterised in that the sleeve (42) is provided with a

female screwthread (41) and is thus screwed on to a male screwthread (40)
on the body (4).
An electrostatic powder spray apparatus according to one of the
preceding claims characterised in that the non-rotatable contact portion

(72) of the ring contact device (68) is pivotable about a longitudinal axis
of the rear conduction portion (64) behind an axial abutment (86) of the

body (4) into an operative position and in the opposite pivotal direction
away from the axial abutment (86) into a removal position in which the non-rotatable

contact portion (72) and the rear conduction portion (64) can be
removed from the body (4) beyond the axial abutment (86), and that the

sleeve (42) engages over the non-rotatable contact portion (72) and thereby
holds it in its operative position so that for pivotal movement of the non-rotatable

contact portion (72) into its removal position the sleeve (42)
must first be moved away from the non-rotatable contact portion (72). 
An electrostatic powder spray apparatus according to one of the
preceding claims characterised in that the ring contact device (68) is

arranged so far away from the charging electrode (20) in the rearward
direction that no electrical high-voltage flash-over can occur from the

charging electrode (20) to the non-rotatable contact portion (72) or the
rear conduction portion (64) even when the powder spray apparatus is used

without the sleeve (42) and thus without the counter-electrode (52) and
without the front conduction portion (66).
An electrostatic powder spray apparatus according to one of the
preceding claims characterised in that formed in the body (4) is a cavity

(36) into which a high-voltage generating means (32) for generating the
high voltage of the charging electrode (20) is fitted interchangeably for

another high-voltage generating means, that the cavity (36) is open in a
forwardly facing end surface (48), and that the high-voltage generating

means (32) is held axially in the cavity (36) by the sleeve (42) and the
sleeve (42) first has to be removed for the interchange operation.

An electrostatic powder spray apparatus according to one of the
preceding claims characterised in that there is provided a second sleeve

(142) which is interchangeable for the first sleeve (42), that the two
sleeves (42; 142) are of different configurations such that the second

sleeve (142) can be fixed to the body (4) only when in addition to the one
sleeve (42) the non-rotatable contact portion (72) and the rear conduction

portion (64) are also removed from the powder spray apparatus.
An electrostatic powder spray apparatus according to claim 9
characterised in that the second sleeve (142) comprises electrically
