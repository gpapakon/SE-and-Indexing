<ABSTRACT>
A hammer mechanism (200,200') for a power tool comprises a 
housing (203), a chuck spindle (201)journalled for rotation in the 

housing and having axial freedom of movement in the housing, a 
rotary ratchet (204) fixed on the spindle, the ratchet having teeth 

(207) facing a rear end of the housing, a fixed ratchet (205) 
rotationally fixed in the housing but having axial freedom of 

movement in the housing, the fixed ratchet surrounding the spindle 
and having teeth (207) facing the teeth of the rotary ratchet, and 

resilient biassing means (213) between said fixed ratchet and 
housing urging said fixed ratchet towards said rotary ratchet. 
First cam means (208,209) between said fixed and rotary 
ratchets have two positions. In a first, said ratchets can engage one 

another, whereby reciprocal motion is imparted on the spindle on 
rotation thereof. In a second position said ratchets are prevented 

from inter-engagement. 
Second cam means (224) between said fixed ratchet and 
housing have two positions. In a first, said fixed ratchet is axially 

locked and in a second position said fixed ratchet is permitted 
rearward movement against said biassing means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power tools and particularly to
hammer mechanisms for such power tools.It is known to provide a hammer mechanism for a power tool
comprising an axially movable chuck spindle shaft journalled for
rotation in a housing, a rotary ratchet fixed on the shaft, a fixed
ratchet in the housing and means selectively to keep the ratchets
apart or permit them to engage on user pressure on the shaft. When
engaged, as well as the rotary motion imposed by a drive for the
shaft, a reciprocating action is imposed on the shaft.Where the power tool is a drill and a chuck mounted on the
chuck spindle shaft is fitted with an appropriate tool bit, the
reciprocating (hammer) action greatly improves drilling performance
in materials such as masonry. However, the reaction of the
reciprocation of the shaft is transmitted to the housing and this is felt
by a user as undesirable vibration. On the other hand, in very tough
materials, cutting performance can be directly related to the pressure
imposed on the housing by the user, and so the user has direct
control of the performance of the drill.It is also known, for example from German Patent Application
No 1,427,728, to isolate the fixed ratchet from the housing via a
spring, so that the reaction of the ratchet is absorbed by the spring.
This not only cushions the impact for the user, so that the tool does
not exhibit so much vibration, but also the energy of the reaction is
stored in the spring and reimparted to the rotary ratchet on return of 
the spring. In some soft materials the cutting performance is actually
improved by the spring because its reaction time is shorter than the
inertia of both the tool and user allows.It is an object of the present invention to provide a hammer
mechanism which is an improvement of the mechanisms known
hitherto.In accordance with the present invention there is provided a
hammer mechanism for a power tool, including:-
a housing;a chuck spindle journalled for rotation in the housing and
having axial freedom of movement in the housing;a rotary ratchet fixed on the spindle, the ratchet having teeth
facing a rear end of the housing;a fixed ratchet rotationally fixed in the housing but having axial
freedom of movement in the housing, the fixed ratchet surrounding
the spindle and having teeth facing the teeth of the rotary ratchet;resilient biassing means between said fixed ratchet and housing
urging said fixed ratchet towards said rotary ratchet andfirst cam means between said fixed and rotary ratchets having
two positions,

<CLAIMS>
A hammer mechanism for a power tool, including:-

a housing (203);
a chuck spindle (201) journalled for rotation in the housing
(203) and having axial freedom of movement in the housing (203);
a rotary ratchet (204) fixed on the spindle (201), the ratchet
(204) having teeth facing a rear end of the housing;
a fixed ratchet (205) rotationally fixed in the housing but having
axial freedom of movement in the housing, the fixed ratchet (205)

surrounding the spindle (201) and having teeth facing the teeth of
the rotary ratchet;
resilient biassing means (213) between said fixed ratchet (205)
and housing urging said fixed ratchet towards said rotary ratchet and
first cam means (208) between said fixed and rotary ratchets
having two positions, in a first of which, said ratchets (204,205)

engage one another, at least when said spindle is moved towards
said rear end of the housing whereby reciprocal motion is imparted

to the spindle (201) on rotation thereof, and in a second of which
positions said ratchets are prevented from inter-engagement,

characterised in that the mechanism comprises;
second cam means (224) between said fixed ratchet and
housing having two positions, in a first of which positions said fixed

ratchet is substantially prevented from rearward movement in the
housing and in a second of which positions said fixed ratchet is

permitted rearward movement against said biassing means (213).
A mechanism as claimed in Claim 1, in which said cam means
each comprise a ring surrounding said spindle (201) and each having

castellations (254,256) which, in said second positions, coincide
with corresponding facing castellations on said fixed ratchet,

whereas in said first positions said castellations inter-digitate.
A mechanism as claimed in Claim 2, in which at least said
castellations (254,256) of the first cam means (208) have ramped

side walls so that mere rotation of the cam rings is sufficient to move
between said positions.
A mechanism as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, in which said
resilient biassing means (213) is disposed between said fixed ratchet

and said second cam means (224).
A mechanism as claimed in Claim 4, in which said second cam
means (224) is pressed against an end cap of said housing, said end

cap and second cam means having detent means(264) therebetween
to releasably retain said second cam means in either of its two

positions.
A mechanism as claimed in Claim 5, in which operating means
(270,258) serve to actuate both cam means together and in which

said detent means have at least three positions corresponding to the
second and first, the first and second and the first and first positions

of the first and second cam means respectively.
A mechanism as claimed in Claim 6, in which said operating
means actuate said cam means in the order specified in Claim 6. 
A mechanism as claimed in Claim 2 and in Claim 6 or 7, in
which said operating means actuate knobs on each ring, which knobs

extend through slots in the housing.
A mechanism as claimed in any of Claims 5 to 8, in which said
detent means comprise a ball (264) received in said end cap and

recess in said second cam means.
A mechanism as claimed in any preceding claim, in which said
fixed ratchet has legs engaged in slots in the housing serving to

rotationally lock said ratchet in the housing and limit axial movement
of the ratchet towards said rotary ratchet.
A mechanism as claimed in Claims 9 and 10, in which, when
said second cam means is in said first position, there is sufficient

clearance between said second cam means and the fixed ratchet to
permit axial movement of the second cam means on rotation thereof

and disengagement of said detent means.
A mechanism as claimed in any preceding claim which is
capable of substantially complete assembly by insertion of parts from

one end of the housing.
A power tool incorporating a hammer mechanism as claimed in
any preceding claim.
A power tool as claimed in Claim 13 when dependent on Claim
6, further comprising a nose ring rotationally freely positioned in a

housing of the power tool and surrounding said mechanism, said
operating means comprising a channel in said nose ring.
