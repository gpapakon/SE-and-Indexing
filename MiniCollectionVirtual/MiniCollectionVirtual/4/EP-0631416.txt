<ABSTRACT>
A foldable portable telephone set is disclosed 
which allows switching between a speech holding 

condition and a speaking condition without the necessity 
of an operation of a key thereby to prevent an operation 

in error. An open or closed condition of a cover 
section (2) relative to a body section (1) is detected 

by means of a reed switch (18) provided on the cover 
section (2), a magnet (19) provided on the body section 

(1), and a detection circuit (27) for detecting an on-or 
off-state of the reed switch (18). A speech holding 

condition is established when it is detected that the 
cover section (2) is closed during speech. In the 

speech holding condition, manually operable keys (16) 
are covered with the body section (1) and not exposed 

outside.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a portable telephone
set, and more particularly to a portable telephone set
of the foldable type.Conventionally, a foldable telephone set of the
type mentioned is constructed such that a telephone set
body is divided into two sections including a body
section and a cover section and they are interconnected
by means of a hinge mechanism or like means so that,
when the telephone set is to be used, the cover section
is opened relative to the body section, but when the
telephone set is not used, they are folded to facilitate
transportation of the telephone set.By the way, in a portable telephone set in
recent years, when a call to the user of the telephone
set is terminated, if the user makes a response to the
terminated call by operation of a key or a like means,
then a speaking condition with an originating person is
established. Then, when it is intended to end the 
speech, a key is manually operated. The portable
telephone set has a response holding function for
notifying, when the user cannot make a response when a
call is terminated, this fact to the originating person.
Also, the portable telephone set has a speech holding
function for temporarily holding, when it is in a
speaking condition, the speech. The response holding
function and the speech holding function are performed
each by way of an operation of a key.In the conventional portable telephone set of
the construction described above, in order to cause, for
example, the speech holding function to operate, it is
required to operate a predetermined key during speech.
However, since a key of a telephone set of the type
described is small, the operability is so low that
another key may be manually operated in error. If a
wrong key is manually operated in this manner, then the
speech may be disconnected. On the other hand, a key
may be manually operated in error while the speech
holding function is operating, and this may cancel
holding of the speech or interrupt the speech.Particularly, since the body section and the
cover section of a foldable portable telephone set are
formed with a comparatively small thickness, switches 
having a comparatively small height are progressively
used for keys disposed on the cover section. Where such
switches are employed, not a key to be operated but
another adjacent key is likely operated manually,
resulting in such troubles as described above.
Consequently, such troubles as described above are
liable to take place.A prior art portable radiotelephone is described in WO-A-91 07836.It is

<CLAIMS>
A foldable portable telephone set, comprising:

a body section (1);
a cover section (2) hinged to said body section for opening
and closing movement relative to said body section;
a magnetic field responsive switch (18) provided on one of
said body section and said cover section;
a magnet (14) provided on the other of said body section and
said cover section such that said magnet is positioned

adjacent to said magnetic field responsive switch when
said cover section is in a closed position; and
means (27) connected to said magnetic field responsive switch
for establishing a speech holding condition when said

cover section is in said closed position.
A foldable portable telephone set as claimed in claim 1,
further comprising a microphone, means for generating a

speech holding message, and a switch circuit for switching
between said microphone and said speech holding message

generation means, said switch circuit being switched to said
speech holding message generation means when it is

detected that said cover section is in said closed position.
A foldable portable telephone set as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein said body section (1) has a first predetermined length,

width and thickness, and said cover section (2) has a second
predetermined length, width and thickness, and wherein said

first predetermined thickness of said body section is substantially
equal to said second predetermined thickness of

said cover section.
A foldable portable telephone set, comprising:

a body section (1) having a receiver (14) and a radio section (21) built
therein;
a cover section (2) having transmitter (17) built therein;
a hinge mechanism (3) connecting said body section to said
cover section for allowing opening and closing pivotable

movement of said cover section with respect to
said body section to an open and closed position,

respectively;
a display device (15) provided on said body section which is
covered by said cover section when said cover section

is in said closed position; 
a power source switch (13) provided on said body section;
an antenna (11) provided on said body section, said antenna
being electrically coupled to said radio section;
a plurality of operation means (16) provided on said cover
section;
detection means (18, 19, 27) provided on one of said body section and
said cover section for detecting whether said cover

section is in said open position or said closed position,
and outputting a signal indicative of whether said cover

section is in said open position or said closed position;
and
control means (26) for receiving the signal from said detection
means controlling sa
id display device between an on-state
and an off-state, and for connecting said transmitter

to said radio section when said cover section is in
said open position to establish a speaking condition,

and for disconnecting said transmitter from said radio
section to establish a speech holding condition when

said cover section is in said closed state, and thereafter
connecting said transmitter back to said radio section

when said cover section is placed back into said open
state, to thereby restore the speaking condition.
A foldable portable telephone set as claimed in claim 4,
further comprising:
