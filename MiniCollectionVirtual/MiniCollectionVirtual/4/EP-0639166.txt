Composting plant having a ventilation system for 
closed rotting p
lants and having first means (V1, V2, R1, 
R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7) which are designed and arranged 

such that using them, any one or more type(s) of flow can 
be selectively set from the following group of types of 

flow: flow over, flow through and flow around a resting 
or agitated mixture stack (10) using conditioned 

circulating air. 
Composting plant according to claim 1, in which the 
first means (V1, V2, R1 to R7) have valves (R1 to R7) for 

defined adjustment of the air guiding paths (K1 to K7, 
K23). 
Composting plant according to claim 2, in which the 
valves (R1 to R7) are designed as controllable valves. 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, in which the first means (V1, V2, R1 to R7) have 

at least two ventilators (V1, V2) which can be adjusted 
as regards their efficiency. 
Composting plant according to claim 4, in which the 
ventilators (V1, V2) can be controlled with respect to 

their efficiency characteristics. 
Composting plant according to claim 4 or 5, in which 
the two ventilators (V1, V2) are connected in parallel in 

a flow direction leading to the stack (10). 
Composting plant according to one of claims 4 to 6, 
having a switching device (K23, R2, R4) for switching the 

two ventilators (V1 and V2) from their parallel 
connection to a series connection, such that the starting  

 
flows of the two ventilators (V1, V2) are superimposed in 

a single flow channel (K3). 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, in which the first means (V1, V2, R1-R7) have at 

least one further ventilator (V3) connected downstream in 
series with the stack (10) in addition to the two 

ventilators (V1, V2) connected in parallel. 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, in which the circulating air system has second 

means (R9) for manual or automatic supply of variable 
quantities of fresh air. 
Composting plant according to claim 9, having third 
means (R8, V3) for passive or ventilator-assisted blowing 

of a quantity of waste air corresponding to the quantity 
of fresh air supplied. 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, having fourth means (W1, W2) for central and/or 

partial heating and moistening of the circulating air. 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, having fifth means for controlling the gas 

composition in the circulating air.
