<ABSTRACT>
An intake system for internal combustion engines with 
multiple cylinders (10). The intake system includes a first 

distribution chamber (13), one separate inlet pipe (15a, 
15b) for each engine cylinder, which inlet pipes extend 

between the first distribution chamber (13) and inlet 
valve/valves of the corresponding cylinders, and at least 

one second distribution chamber (16, 16a, 16b). This is 
connectable to each inlet pipe (15a, 15b) between said first 

chamber and the inlet valve via one corresponding passage, 
which can be opened by means of an operable throttle valve 

(19). Each second distribution chamber (16, 16a, 16b) is 
connected to the first distribution chamber (13) via at 

least one resonance pipe (14), the inlet of which to the 
second distribution chamber is openable by means of an 

additional throttle valve (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
An intake system for an internal combustion engine with 
multiple cylinders, including a first distribution chamber, 
one separate inlet pipe for each engine cylinder, which 
inlet pipes extend between the first distribution chamber 
and the inlet valve/valves of the corresponding cylinder, 
and at least one second distribution chamber, which is 
connectable to each one of the inlet pipes between said 
first chamber and the inlet valve via one passage each, 
which passage can be opened by means of an operable throttle 
valve, whereby each second distribution chamber is connected 
to the first distribution chamber via at least one resonance 
pipe. It is known at internal combustion engines used within a 
relatively broad range of engine speeds, that the gas volume 
sucked in at a certain engine speeds, can be increased by 
tuning the length and diameter of the inlet pipes, thereby 
also increasing the so-called volumetric efficiency of the 
engine. This depends on, that the gas quantity present in 
the intake system is influenced by the operating frequency 
of the inlet valves, so that the gas comes in resonance 
oscillation. When the oscillation period corresponds to the 
operating frequency of the valves, the above mentioned 
increase of the volumetric efficiency is obtained. 
Consequently, at certain engine speeds a higher volumetric 
efficiency is achieved with a long inlet pipe, whereas at 
other engine speeds, a short inlet pipe gives a higher 
volumetric efficiency. It is also earlier known, for example from EP 0182223, to 
provide an extra air distribution chamber, which is placed 
between the first distribution chamber and the inlet valves 
and which is connected to each inlet pipe via an openable 
throttle. By means of this arrangement the efficient length  
 
on the inlet pipes can be varied, whereby opening of the 
throttles gives an increase of the volumetric efficiency 
within a higher range of engine speed. It is desirable to place the point for transition from the 
first range of use to the second range of use, at such a 
point and with such overlapping of the two curves, that no 
marked drop in torque is experienced, in said transition 
area. Hereby the positive effect of these known arrangements 
in reality becomes rather limited. JP-A-63-280822 discloses an intake system according to the 
preamble of the main claim, wherein the inlet of the 
resonance pipe to the first distribution chamber is openable 
by means of an additional throttle valve. This prior art 
intake system uses
