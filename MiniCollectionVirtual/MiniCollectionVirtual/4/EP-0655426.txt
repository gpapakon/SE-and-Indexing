<ABSTRACT>
A glass-ceramic composite comprising an 
oxynitride glass containing 0.1 to 10 wt. % of 

nitrogen and nitride ceramic particles dispersed 
therein. The glass-ceramic composite is produced by 

sintering a molded body having a given shape at a 
temperature of 800 to 1,200°C, said molded body 

comprising a mixture of an oxynitride glass powder 
containing 0.1 to 10 wt. % of elementary nitrogen 

incorporated thereinto by treating a starting oxide 
glass powder in an atmosphere of nitrogen at a 

temperature of 300 to 800°C with a nitride ceramic 
powder washed with or boiled in water of 5 to 10 in 

pH. The composite is suitable as a substrate material 
for mounting thereon semiconductor elements and has a 

sintering temperature of at most 1,200°C, a dielectric 
constant of at most 7, a thermal conductivity of at 

least 20 W/m·K, and a mechanical strength of at least 
20 kg/mm² while securing a high peel strength and a 

high reliability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a glass-ceramic 
composite suitable as a substrate material for 
mounting thereon semiconductor elements, and a process 
for producing the same. In order to cope with the trend toward higher-speed, 
higher-density and reduced-size information and 
communication equipments, substrate materials for 
mounting thereon semiconductor elements are required 
to have the following characteristics. 
1. The temperature of sintering a substrate 
material is at most 1,200°C. This enables a low-resistance 
metallic material such as gold, silver or 
copper to be used as a conductive material in wiring, 
whereby the speed-up of signal transmission can be 
achieved. 2. The dielectric constant is at most 7. The 
speed-up of signal transmission can be achieved by 
forming the circumference of a wiring from a material 
having a low dielectric constant. 3. The mechanical strength is at least 20 
kg/mm2. This can make the substrate material thin 
enough to miniaturize a semiconductor element device, 
while preventing chipping and cracking of the  
 
substrate material, e.g., in the course of production 
of such a device to improve the yield thereof, thus 
enabling the product to be provided at a low cost. 4. The thermal conductivity is at least 20 
W/m·K. This allows efficient dissipation of heat 
generated by semiconductor elements. This in turn 
allows high-density mounting of semiconductor 
elements, thus enabling miniaturization of a device. 5. The peel strength is at least 1 kg /mm2. 
This enables wirings of gold or the like to be stably 
metallized on a substrate. However, the conventional multi-layer substrate 
materials have not satisfied the foregoing 
characteristics required thereof. For example, 
ceramic materials such as alumina and aluminum nitride 
are those sintered at a temperature of at least 
1,600°C and have a dielectric constant of at least 8 
to 9, thus failing to satisfy the above-mentioned 
characteristics 1 and 3. Crystallized glasses such as 
cordierite (2MgO·2Al2O3·SiO2), composite glass 
materials of a crystallized glass with an amorphous 
glass such as borosilicate glass, and oxide ceramic-glass 
composite materials such as aluminum oxide-borosilicate 
glass have a mechanical strength of as 
low as 10 to 20 kg/mm2 and a thermal conductivity of 
as low as around 5 W/m·K, thus failing to satisfy the 
above-mentioned characteristics 2 and 4. Further, 
they can provide only substrates low in adhesion to 
wirings and hence low in peel strength therebetween 
because the
