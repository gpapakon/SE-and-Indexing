<ABSTRACT>
Novel 1,2-dioxetanes with improved chemiluminescent properties, such as signal intensity, S/N ratio, T1/2, etc. are provided by spiroadamantyl 1,2-dioxetanes, wherein the remaining carbon atom of the ring bears an alkoxy, aryloxy, or arylalkoxy substituent, and either a phenyl or naphthyl ring, this aromatic ring bearing, at the meta position on the phenyl group, or a non-conjugated position on the naphthyl ring, an OX moiety wherein X is an enzyme-clevable group, which when removed from the dioxetane, leaves the oxyanion which decomposes with chemiluminescence, the aryl ring further bearing an electron-active substituent Z. The nature and placement of the Z substituent, at a position not adjacent the point of attachment to the dioxetane ring, strongly influences the properties of the dioxetane. Assays, as well as kits for the performance of those assays, include the dioxetane, an enzyme capable of cleaving the X group, and in certain cases, membranes and chemiluminescent enhancement agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to chemiluminescent 1,2-dioxetane 
derivatives which can be enzymatically activated to decompose and, 
through decomposition, release light. The dioxetanes are 
particularly characterized by the presence of an aromatic (phenyl 
or naphthyl) ring bonded to the dioxetane, which ring bears a meta-substituted 
or disjoint enzymatically cleavable group, which when 
cleaved, leaves the phenoxyanion or naphthyloxyanion of the 
dioxetane, and, at the four or the five position in the case of the 
phenyl, for example, an electron donating or electron withdrawing 
group. By selecting the identity of the substituent at the four or 
five position (the Z moiety) particular aspects of the 
chemiluminescent properties of the dioxetane, including half life, 
quantum yield, S/N ratio, etc., can be altered.  
 1,2-dioxetane enzyme substrates have been well established as 
highly efficient chemiluminescent reporter molecules for use in 
enzyme immunoassays and nucleic acid probe assays of a wide variety 
of types. These assays provide a preferred alternative to 
conventional assays that rely on radioisotopes, fluorophores, 
complicated color shifting, secondary reactions and the like. 
Dioxetanes developed for this purpose include those disclosed in 
U.S. Patent 4,978,614 as well as U.S. Patent 5,112,960. U.S. 
Patent 4,978,614 discloses, among others, 3-(2'-spiroadamantane)4-methoxy-4-(3''-phosphoryloxy)phenyl-1,2-dioxetane, 
which has 
received world-wide attention, and is commercially available under 
the trade name AMPPD. U.S. Patent 5,112,960, discloses compounds, 
wherein the adamantyl stabilizing ring is substituted, at either 
bridgehead position, with a variety of substituents, including 
hydroxy, halogen, and the like, which convert the otherwise static 
or passive adamantyl stabilizing group into an active group 
involved in the kinetics of decomposition of the dioxetane ring. 
Compounds of this type have similarly received international 
attention, giving a faster and stronger signal than AMPPD in many 
applications. CSPD is a spiroadamantyl phenylphosphate dioxetane 
bearing a chlorine substituent on the adamantyl group, and, like 
AMPPD, is available from Tropix, Inc. of Bedford, Mass.  
 Compounds of this type have been particularly developed for 
enhanced sensitivity in assays for the presence of analytes in 
concentrations as low as 10-12M and lower. In certain applications, 
compounds of this type are used in conjunction with enhancers to 
detect analytes in concentration of 10-12M
