<ABSTRACT>
Foldable frame for vehicles with two or more wheels comprising: 

a) a front fork (7), connected to a head tube (3) by means of a first 
hinge (5); 
b) a handlebar (15) connected to said head tube (3) by a second hinge 
(14); 
c) a connecting rod (18) hinged at (17) to the handlebar (15) and at (19) 
to the front fork (7), in order to allow the front fork (7) to rotate 

thus folding back the handlebar (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foldable frame to be used in a vehicle
with two or more wheels which is driven either by an engine or by muscle
power.By means of the frame which is the object of the present invention, it is
possible to realize a foldable vehicle in such a way that if necessary
the bulk of the same vehicle may be reduced in order for example to be
transported in the boot of a car.In the art, it is well known that foldable frames may be used for the
construction of bicycles or motorcycles.For example, in US Patent No. 3,887,218 a foldable vehicle is considered
having a frame with at least a first articulated quadrilateral connected
by means of at least one lever to a seat mounted on a second articulated
quadrilateral; moving the seat downwards causes the first articulated
quadrilateral to move and this results in the back wheel of the vehicle
being moved inwards. The handlebar is foldable whereas the front wheel is
fixed in place. Despite the definite advantages due to the ease with
which the back part of the frame can be folded, nonetheless it is not
possible to reduce the bulk to an absolute minimum since the front wheel
cannot be displaced.In the French patent application FR 2 173 683 (P. Herry) a bicycle is
considered wherein the back wheel can be displaced when the frame is
folded inwards while the front wheel can be rotated about the axis of the
handlebar. Tile back wheel is moved by means of a connecting rod device
which is used to rotate the back fork. The distance between the rotation 
axis of the back wheel and the pivot of the pedals is modified by the
folding operation and it is therefore necessary to add a device in order
to keep the chain taut even when the frame is folded.The European Patent Application EP-A-0 263 554 shows a foldable frame for
vehicles with two or more wheels, comprising a front fork, connected to a
head tube (coaxial to the steering column) by means of a first hinge and
a handlebar connected to said head tube by means of a second hinge.The present invention relates to a foldable frame for vehicles with two
or more wheels as that shown by the European Patent Application EP-A-0
263 554, further comprising a connecting rod hinged to said handlebar
and to said fork and apt to fold the fork when folding the handlebar.The present invention relates moreover to a device for blocking the
handlebar in use position, consisting of a hook stressed by a spring.Using the present invention it is possible to achieve a considerable
reduction in the bulk of the frame

Foldable frame for vehicles with two or more wheels comprising:

a) a front fork (7), connected to a head tube (3) by means of a first
hinge (5);
b) a handlebar (15) connected to said head tube (3) by means of a second
hinge (14);

characterised by further comprising a connecting rod (18) connected by
means of a first articulated joint (17) to said handlebar (15) and by

means of a second articulated joint (19) to said front fork (7), designed
to fold said front fork (7) when folding said handlebar (15).
Foldable frame according to claim 1, wherein in use position the
handlebar (15) is blocked by a hook (20) stressed by a spring (22).
