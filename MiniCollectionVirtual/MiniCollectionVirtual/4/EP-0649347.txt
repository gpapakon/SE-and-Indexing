<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cyclone separator for separating substances from a fibre-liquid-suspension, particularly a paper clip suspension. The separator includes a main part (3) which has an inner, conical chamber (4) which is provided with an essentially tangentially directed inlet at the wider end (5) of the chamber. The chamber (3) tapers conically downwards and the inner surface of the chamber has a screw-like configuration. This screw-like configuration includes a first upper surface or flank (1) and a second lower surface or flank (2), wherein the flank (1) that faces towards the wider end of the chamber defines an angle (alpha) with the chamber centre line and the second flank (2) which faces towards the narrower end (6) of the chamber defines an angle (tau) with the first flank (1). The second flank (2) and its extension form together with the first flank (1) of the nearest underlying helix of the screw-like configuration a triangle which has a line that extends through the apex of the nearest underlying part of the helix or helical screw-thread and which extends parallel with the chamber centre line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cyclone separator
for separating substances from a fibre-liquid-suspension,
particularly paper pulp suspensions, of the kind
defined in the preamble of the following Claim 1.Cyclones of the kind used in the paper industry to
cleanse a paper pulp suspension from contaminants and
impurities in the form of sand grains, metal particles,
chips, splinters and larger métal objects, such as paper
clips and paper staples that are liable to be contained
by paper pulp produced from wastepaper will
typicelly comprise an elongated cyclone chamber which
tapers in a direction towards one end thereof and
which is provided at its wider end with a tangentially
directed inlet for the suspension to be cleaned and an
axially directed outlet for cleaned suspension, the accept,
and which further includes an axially directed
second outlet for the contaminants or impurities, i.e.
the reject.A cyclone separator of this kind operates in the
following manner:The suspension to be cleaned is fed at high speed into
the chamber, through the tangentially directed inlet
provided in the upper, wider part of the chamber. The
input suspension thereby moves helically or spirally
on the inner surface of the wall of the separator, in
a direction towards the opposite, narrower end of the
chamber, i.e. towards the axially directed second
outlet. The heavier particles in the suspension, i.e.
the contaminants, endeavour to collect against the
wall of the cyclone, while the lighter particles, i.e. 
the fibres, collect in the centre of the cyclone. The
contaminants are moved down into the tapering or
narrowing part of the cyclone and exit therefrom
through the axially directed second outlet. The inner
part of the vortex, on the other hand, turns at the
lower end of the tapering part of the cyclone and
moves axially in an opposite direction, forming a
helical or spiralling vortex, and leaves the cyclone
through the upper end thereof in the form of a light,
clean fraction called the accept. Thus, when cleansing
paper pulp suspensions, the accept will essentially
contain fibres of the desired nature.The cyclone chamber of those cyclone separators known
hitherto for cleansing paper pulp suspensions have an
inner wall which is either smooth or is provided with
helically extending screw grooves which facilitate
movement of the coarser and heavier contaminants down
towards the bottom outlet of the cyclone, as illustrated
for instance in Prior Publications US-A
3,399,770, DE-C 2,285,233 and SE-C 187,435.During the coarse

<CLAIMS>
A cyclone separator for separating substances from a
fibre-liquid-suspension particularly a paper pulp suspension

wherein the separator comprises a main part including
an inner conical chamber having a centre line,

an inner surface with a wide end, and a generally tangentially
directed inlet at the wide end, the chamber

tapering conically downward from the wide end and having
a screw-like configuration to provide helical

threads on the inner surface thereof,
wherein each of the threads of the screw-like inner surface

includes an upper surface 1 and a lower surface 2,
the upper surface 1 facing towards the wide end 5 of

the chamber 4 and defining an angle α with the chamber
centre line, the lower surface 2 facing away from the

wide end 5 and intersecting with the upper surface 1,
of the next underlying thread at an angle γ,

characterized by the angle γ lying within the
range (90° - α) -90° so that the lower thread surface 2

acts as an inclined plane to advance downwardly particles
moved against the inner surface of the chamber 4

and under this lower thread surface.
A cyclone separator according to claim 1, characterized
in that an angle β is defined between a line that

extends parallel with the chamber centre line and and
inner imaginary surface A containing the intersections

of the upper and lower surfaces 1, 2 of the extending
helical threads.
A cyclone separator according to claim 2, characterized
in that the angle α is greater than the angle β.
A cyclone separator according to claim 1, characterized
in that the screw-like inner surface has one or

more inputs at the wide end 5 of the chamber 4. 
A cyclone separator according to claim 1, characterized
in that the lower thread surface 2 has a constant

width over the whole of its length.
