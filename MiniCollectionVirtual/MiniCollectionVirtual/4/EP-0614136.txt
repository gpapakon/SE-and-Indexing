<ABSTRACT>
A power supply shunt regulator (PSSR) is proposed 
which regulates the current flowing to a branch (FET, L
D
, 
CSR) coupled in parallel to a power supply (SA) and an 

electrical load (EL). 
The proposed regulator limits the discharge current 
from a parasitic capacitor (PSC) of the power supply when a 

shunt switch included in the branch is turned on. An active 
negative feedback loop (CLM, FET) therefore regulates the 

current through the branch by measuring the voltage drop (RI) 
over a current sensing resistor (CSR) included therein and by 

deriving a control signal (ACTRL) for the shunt switch in 
such a way that this voltage drop strives in a critically 

damped way to a maximum voltage drop. This can be done in a 
simple way, taking into account that the shunt switch is 

chosen to be a field effect transistor, thanks to the fact 
that an inductor (L
D
) is coupled to the source of the shunt 
switch ensuring stable operation. 
This regulator is particularly well suited for use 
in spacecrafts where a number of power supply units, in each 

of which the power supply is constituted by a specific solar 
array, are used to supply power to the electrical load.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power supply shunt regulator as described
in the preamble of claim 1.Such a power supply shunt regulator is already known in the art, e.g. from
the article "Design and development of a sequential switching shunt regulator", by
I.R. White, Proc. of the 3d ESTEC Spacecraft Power Conditioning Seminar,
Noordwijk (NL), 21-23 September 1977, pp. 133-136. This regulator is used to
control the power supplied to the load by the power supply which consists of solar
cells.A problem with such a shunt regulator is that, when the shunt switch is turned
on, the parasitic capacitor across the power supply discharges abruptly due to the
short circuit which is so established. The current peak caused by this discharge may
damage the shunt switch and thus reduces the system reliability. This is all the more
worrying when the frequency with which the shunt switch is turned on and off is
relatively high and when the regulator is used in spacecrafts which require very
high reliability.The known regulator therefore limits this discharge current via the current
limitation means which includes in particular a capacitor C1 shown in Figure 7 of
the referenced article. This capacitor artificially increases the Miller capacitance of
the shunt switch, formed by T2 and T3, and thereby slows down the response of
the regulator so limiting the current through the switch to a value which is
dependent on the parasitic capacitance across the power supply and the power
supplied by it. Since the power supplied and the value of the parasitic capacitance are nonlinear
and time- and temperature dependent, this known regulator has to limit the
current to a value which is substantially lower than the maximum current dictated
by a specific application by taking into account the above variations. In this way
less current is available for the discharge of the parasitic capacitance leading to a
slower discharge and consequently also to a larger power dissipation in the shunt
switch. This larger dissipation diminishes the reliability of the regulator.Moreover would the design of the regulator have to be redone for every
application which is characterized by other parameters, for instance another
parasitic capacitance. A further drawback of this known regulator is that the shunt
switch is made with bipolar transistors which, due to their relatively high saturation
voltage when turned on, dissipate relatively much energy thus complicating the
design and increasing the dimensions of the regulator.A shunt regulator of the
