<ABSTRACT>
An anchor for concrete and the like has a head (1) and a shank (2) to be driven into a prebored hole whose cross-sectional dimensions are smaller than the largest cross-sectional dimensions of the shank. At least along a portion (4) closest to the end (3) opposite to the head (1), the shank (2) is widened by a longitudinal groove (5) formed therein prior to hardening of the anchor, such that this portion (4) has a substantially U-shaped cross-section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an anchor serving to anchor
an object to an underlying structure made of such
a hard material as concrete, the anchor having a head
and a shank to be driven into a hole prebored in the underlying
structure.Some prior-art anchors use elements that expand
when the anchor is driven in. However, such anchors
not only have the disadvantage of requiring the additional
expanding element, but also suffer from the drawback
of usually requiring the prebored hole to have an exact
depth to ensure satisfactory expansion and anchorage.DE-A1-33 45 331 teaches such an anchor, which
however does not require the prebored hole to have a
given depth. In this instance, the shank has a through
slot extending in the longitudinal direction from the pointed
tip of the anchor, thus forming two legs which are
slightly parted by a resilient element placed in the slot.
When the anchor is driven into the prebored hole, the
shank legs are pressed together against the action of
the resilient element therebetween. Once the anchor
has been driven into the hole, the legs exert a pressure
on the walls of the prebored hole owing to the action of
the resilient element, but this pressure is relatively insignificant,
and the anchor thus has poor resistance to
extraction.Alternatively, there are anchors which are made in
one piece and whose shanks have an undulating shape
and larger cross-sectional dimensions than the prebored
hole. Thus, the shank is forced to change its shape
when driven into the prebored hole.US-A-4,828,445 teaches an anchor of this type
Here, the shank is made of an elastic material and has
an undulating shape. When driven into the prebored
hole, the shank is thus straightened and strives to resist
extraction by exerting a spring action on the walls of the
hole. The hole and the shank have circular cross-section
and essentially the same diameter. Because of the undulating
shape of the shank, the anchor has a tendency
towards bending when driven in, which may preclude
the completion of this operation. Furthermore, an extraction
force acting on the inserted anchor strives to
straighten the undulating shape, thereby reducing the
friction between the shank and the walls of the hole so
that a relatively small force is needed for extracting the
anchor. In addition, the shank has a limited number of
contact points, more precisely the crests, where it is in
frictional engagement with the walls of the hole, which
also contributes to lessening the force needed for extracting
the anchor Similarly,
