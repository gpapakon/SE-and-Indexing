<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of high
intensity, efficient incandescent lamps, reflectors, and a
reflector system and method of making an efficient high
intensity bulb and reflector system.Incandescent lamps have been well known for several
decades and have been employed in a wide variety of
circumstances. In more commonplace applications the lamps
have been optimized around considerations of fire safety,
heat load, size, etc. In the medical field, the design of
instruments which use light sources are evolving along with
the light sources they employ. Unlike the commonplace
applications of incandescent lamps, medical applications
require a different set of considerations. For example, in
a commonplace application where a higher intensity of light
is required, the designer might increase the voltage of the
lamp and its glass envelope size. However, in medical
applications, increased voltage and current, and even lamp
size may not be compatible with the medical instrument with
which the light is used.One method for increasing the light intensity has been
the use of fiber optics. In this method, a very high
intensity light source is placed in optical alignment with
one end of a fiber optic cable. The cable is then extended
into a medical instrument to supply light where needed.
The disadvantages to this method are the excessive heat
generated at the light source, the inefficient light
capture since only a portion of the light ever makes its
way into the fiber optic cable, and the limited mobility of
the medical instrument, since it must always be at the end
of a fiber optic cable. Sterilization requirements may 
also mitigate against the use of fiber optics at the
working end of an instrument since repeated sterilization
may cause a denigration of the fiber.In portable instruments, several limitations are
present. First, efficiency is of paramount importance.
Since most of the instruments are battery powered, a large
current drain would be unacceptable. An extended use would
require an interruption in the procedure to change
batteries, even if new batteries were supplied at the
beginning of each new procedure.Another important aspect is safety. In medical
instruments, the bulb must be adequately supported and
protected from breakage. Not only would breakage interrupt
the procedure, but shards of glass could be introduced into
contact with the patient. The bulb could be encased in an
additional layer of translucent material, but such would
cause a degradation of performance. This is especially
