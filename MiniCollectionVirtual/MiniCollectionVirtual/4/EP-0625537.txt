<ABSTRACT>
An adhesive usable for electroless plating in 
the formation of printed circuit boards is formed by 

dispersing a cured heat-resistant resin powder soluble 
in an acid or an oxidizing agent into an uncured heat-resistant 

resin matrix hardly soluble in an acid or an 
oxidizing agent after the curing treatment, in which the 

heat-resistant resin matrix is a mixture of a 
thermoplastic resin and an uncured thermosetting resin 

or an uncured photosensitive resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adhesive, an
adhesive layer for electroless plating and a printed
circuit board, and more particularly to an adhesive
technique capable of stably providing a printed circuit
board having an excellent peel strength even in wiring
with higher density and pattern accuracy.Recently, miniaturization and high-speed
performance of electron equipment are proceeded with the
advance of electron industry, and consequently it is
demanded to have high densification and reliability
through fine pattern against printed circuit board and
printed wiring substrate mounting LSI.Lately, an additive process in which an
adhesive is applied onto a surface of a substrate to
form an adhesive layer, and the surface of the adhesive
layer is roughened and then subjected to an electroless
plating to form a conductor is noticed as a method of
forming the conductor onto the printed wiring substrate.According to this method, the conductor is 
formed by electroless plating after the formation of the
resist, so that it has a merit that conductor wiring
having high density and pattern accuracy can be produced
with a low cost as compared with an etched foil process
conducting the formation of pattern through etching
(which is called as a subtractive process).In the additive process, there have hitherto
been known a method in which fine unevenness is formed
on the conductor-forming surface side of the adhesive
layer through a chemical etching as a means for
improving the adhesion property between conductor and
adhesive layer (hereinafter referred to as peel
strength). According to this method, the unevenness of
the adhesive layer surface is filled with a plating
metal such as a plating copper or the like, whereby the
peel strength can be improved through an anchor effect
based on the unevenness. Such an improvement of the
peel strength through the anchor effect is generally
carried out by enlarging the braking surface or by
increasing the strength of the conductor metal or the
heat-resistant resin matrix constituting the adhesive.In recent additive type printed circuit board
requiring the formation of wiring with high density and
pattern accuracy, it is required to make small anchor
formed by surface roughening of the adhesive layer in
order to precisely form the fine pattern of the resist.
Therefore, this conventional technique causes a problem 
that as the anchor becomes small, the breaking area is
also small and hence the peel strength considerably
lowers.In order to solve this problem, there is a
method of
