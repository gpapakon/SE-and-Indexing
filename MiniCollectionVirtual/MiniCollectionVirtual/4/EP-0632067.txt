<ABSTRACT>
Gel-free ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers having a high content of copolymerised vinyl acetate and a high Mooney viscosity are prepared by carrying out the polymerisation in solution in the presence of from 20 to 45 % by weight of tert-butanol, based on the reaction solution, at temperatures of from 50 to 80 DEG C and pressures of from 300 to 450 bar using azo compounds in a stirred-reactor cascade at a mean residence time of the reaction solution in the reaction cascade of from 5 to 9 hours and a conversion of from 50 to 70 % by weight, based on the vinyl acetate employed. The ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer prepared by the novel process can be used for the preparation of vulcanisates having improved mechanical properties.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of gel-free ethylene/vinyl 
acetate copolymers having an elevated content of 

copolymerised vinyl acetate and an elevated Mooney 
viscosity, characterised in that polymerisation is 

performed in solution in the presence of 20 to 45 wt.% 
of tert.-butanol, relative to the reaction solution, 

at temperatures of 50 to 80°C and pressures of 300 to 
450 bar using azo compounds in a series of stirred-tank 

reactors with an average residence time of the 
reaction solution in the series of stirred-tank 

reactors, which consists of 2 to 10 reactors, of 5 to 
9 hours and a conversion of 50 to 70 wt.%, relative to 

the introduced vinyl acetate, and wherein temperature 

control in the series of stirred-tank reactors is 
selected such that the same proportion of introduced 

initiator decomposes in each stirred-tank reactor. 
Use of the ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers produced 
according to claim 1 for the production of 

vulcanisates.
