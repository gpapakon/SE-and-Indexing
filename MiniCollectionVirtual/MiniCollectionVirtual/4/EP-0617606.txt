<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tape laminates and in 
particular to composite pre-laminated tapes for forming 
closures, e.g., for disposable diapers. At least as early as 1955, it had been suggested 
to use strips of normally tacky and pressure-sensitive 
adhesive tape to secure conventional cloth diapers on 
an infant, see for example U.S. Patent Nos. 2,714,889 
and 3,221,738. A few years later, when disposable 
diapers became extremely popular, strips of pressure-sensitive 
adhesive tape were again employed as 
closures, see for example U.S. Patent No. 3,620,217. A disposable diaper typically has a thin, 
flexible, low density polyethylene film cover, an 
absorbent filler within the cover, and a porous inner 
liner overlying the filler. The diaper is positioned 
at the crotch of an infant with the two ends of the 
diaper extending toward the front and back, 
respectively. Edges on each side of the diaper are 
then either positioned adjacent to each other or 
overlapped using a strip of pressure-sensitive adhesive 
tape being adhered to the cover film at border regions 
adjacent each of the two edges to hold the diaper 
closed. After a tape closure has been opened, it is 
frequently discovered that the diaper has not been 
soiled and hence that there is no need to replace it. 
If the diaper cover has not been torn, a second strip 
of tape can sometimes be applied as a replacement 
closure, but this is often inconvenient. As a result, 
considerable work has been undertaken to develop a tape  
 
diaper closure that is not only capable of bonding 
firmly to the diaper cover but is also capable of being 
opened without destroying the tape diaper closure or 
the diaper cover and subsequently reclosed. Closures 
of this type have involved a combination of two or more 
tapes, one of which remains permanently adhered to one 
edge of the diaper and the other being removably 
adhered to the other edge of the diaper. Examples of 
such products are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 
3,951,149, 3,987,793, 3,999,546, 4,020,842, 4,227,530, 
4,726,971 and 4,801,480, and European Patent No. 
0148587A. Typically, tape closures for diapers are 
fabricated by positionably mounting a plurality of 
individual rolls of the appropriate tapes and combining 
then in situ to form a composite strip of tape, the 
width of which is substantially the same as the length 
of the diaper closure to be fabricated. The composite 
roll is then severed at right angles to the edges of 
the composite strip at intervals corresponding to the 
width of

<CLAIMS>
A laminate tape construction comprising two or more 
tapes (12, 18 or 21) each having a layer of pressure-sensitive 

adhesive (15, 19 or 22) on a first face 
characterized in that at least one of the tapes (12, 18 

or 21) comprises a porous paper backing (13, 18 or 21) 
having, on the opposite side to said adhesive layer, a 

continuous release coating of a solventless, radiation-cured 
silicone applied directly to the paper such that 

silicone is not on the porous paper backing (13, 18 or 
21) first face. 
A laminate tape construction comprising a fastening 
tape (12) divided into a bonded section (16) and a 

fastening section (17) with the fastening tape comprising 
an elongated strip of paper backing material (13), having 

first and second edges, being substantially as wide as 
said tape composite and having a first layer of normally 

tacky and pressure-sensitive adhesive (15) coated over 
substantially one surface of said backing material (13), 

and a release coating applied directly to the other 
surface, a target tape (18), having first and second 

surfaces, the first surface adhered to said first layer 
of pressure-sensitive adhesive (15); a second layer of 

normally tacky and pressure-sensitive adhesive (19) 
coated on the second surface of the target tape (18); a 

release tape (21), having first and second surfaces, the 

first surface adhered to said second layer of pressure-sensitive 
adhesive (19); a third layer of normally tacky 

and pressure-sensitive adhesive (22) coated over the 
second surface of said release tape (21), and a unifying 

strip (24) centered over said release tape (21) edge and 
adhered to the third layer of pressure-sensitive 

adhesives (22) and to the first adhesive layer (15) on 
the fastening tape characterized in that at least one of 

the tapes (12, 18 or 21) comprises a porous paper backing 
(13, 18 or 21) having on a first face said adhesive layer 

and on the opposite side to said adhesive layer, a  
 

continuous release coating of a solventless, radiation-cured 
silicone applied directly to the paper such that 

silicone is not on the porous paper backing (13, 18 or 
21) first face. 
A laminate tape construction as claimed in Claim 2 
in which a first fingerlift (20) is interposed between 

the first adhesive layer (15) and the target tape (18) at 
the second edge and a second fingerlift (23) is 

interposed between the second adhesive layer (19) and the 
release tape (21) at the second edge. 
A laminate tape construction as claimed in Claim 2 
in which the paper backing (13) of the fastening tape 

(12) is free from adhesive at the second edge to provide 
a fingerlift facility. 
A laminate tape construction as claimed in any 
preceding claim in which the porous paper backing has a 

basis weight of from 50 to 150 g/m². 
A laminate tape construction as claimed in Claim 5 
in which the porous paper backing has a basis weight of 

from 80 to 110 g/m². 
A laminate tape construction as claimed in any 
preceding claim in which the coating weight of the 

solventless, radiation-cured silicone release coating is 
from 0.4 to 2.0 g/m². 
A laminate tape construction as claimed in any 
preceding claim in which the pressure-sensitive adhesive 

layer (15, 19 or 22) is a hot melt adhesive or a solvent 
based adhesive. 
A laminate tape as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which the peel strength of the pressure-sensitive 

adhesive layer (15, 19 or 22) on said solventless, 
radiation-cured silicone release layer is from 0.1 to 3.0 

newtons per 25mm width. 
A laminate tape as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which the porous paper backing is coloured and/or bears 

printed indicia.
