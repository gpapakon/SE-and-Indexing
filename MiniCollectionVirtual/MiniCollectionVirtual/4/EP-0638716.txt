<ABSTRACT>
In a throttle device for internal combustion engines with electrical coupling for emergency running, coupling is by means of a solenoid actuator (14), which is controlled by signals from the control module and on the other hand bears against the stop face (14) of an arbitrarily adjustable actuating lever (15) or a control lever (16) connected to this. This device permits volumetric control without reaction on an accelerator pedal and can be performed with dead electrical leads.

<CLAIMS>
Throttle valve device for i.c. engines having a
throttle lever for electromotive displacement of the

throttle valve in accordance with control signals of
an electronic control unit, having an operating lever

for setpoint input by an accelerator pedal operated by
the engine operator and having a limp-home device for

direct coupling of the throttle lever to the operating
lever, the coupling being effected by an

electromagnetic actuator, which is controlled by
signals of the control unit, 
characterized in
 that the
actuator (14) comprises an actuating element (16)

having two lever projections (17, 18), that during
normal operation is fixed relative to the throttle

housing (2), the lever projections (17, 18) being
coupled by in each case one bracket element (22) to

the throttle lever (7) and to the operating lever (9)
in such a way that oppositely directed throttle lever

and operating lever displacements are enabled by
opening out of the spring-loaded bracket elements

(22).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the
actuating element (16) is connected directly to the

magnet armature of the magnetic actuator (14).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the
actuating element (16) is arrested by a blocking

element (23) connected to a magnet armature.
