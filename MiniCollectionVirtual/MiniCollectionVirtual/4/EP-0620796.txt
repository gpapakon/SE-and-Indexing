<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a safety-closure sealing cap (1) made of plastic and designed to physically interlock with the threaded portion (2) of the safety closure. Two downwards-projecting anchoring flaps (9), which are attached to the cap top (7) so that they can pivot, are connected to each other by two splayed struts (12) which are joined to each other so that they can pivot. When the sealing cap (1) is pressed on to the closure, the two splayed struts (12) are pushed into an essentially extended position and thus cause the two anchoring flaps (9) to splay outwards, teeth (11) on the flaps thus engaging in grooves (6) on the inside surface of the threaded portion (2) of the closure. At the same time, the two splayed struts (12) engage with a lock-in tooth (18) which is connected to the top (7) of the cap. The sealing cap (1) can only be opened by destroying it.

<CLAIMS>
A sealing cap (1) for a safety closure including a 
sealing screw (2) having an upwardly open recess (3) 

including at least one undercut (6) on its inner edge, 
with the plastic sealing cap (1) including a cap surface 

(7) overlapping the sealing screw (2) and a cap edge (8) 
overlapping the edge of the safety closure and at least 

one anchoring unit (9) projecting downward from the cap 
surface (7), engaging behind the undercut (6) of the 

sealing screw (2) when closed, thus being fully engaged, 
characterised in that two anchoring flaps (9) hinged to 

the cap surface (7) are projecting downward, each 
including on the outside anchoring teeth (11) engaging 

into the surrounding undercut (6) and that the two 
anchoring flaps (9) are connected to each other by one 

hinged web (13) each to two hinged expansion braces (12) 
supported by the bottom of the recess (3) of the sealing 

screw (2). 
A sealing cap according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the two expansion braces (12), when closed, are 

engaged in at least one catch (18) projecting downward 
from the cap surface (7). 
A sealing cap according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the catch consists of a catch web (18) connected to 

the cap surface (7) provided with a catch edge (19) on 
either side and that one of the catch hooks (20) each 

allocated to an expansion brace (12) engages into each 
catch edge (19) when the cap is closed.  

 
A sealing cap according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the catch web (18) forms a stop for the expansion 

braces (12), thus preventing upward movement of the 
expansion braces (12) when closed. 
A sealing cap according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that each expansion brace (12) includes a rib (16) on its 

top, supported by the inside of the hinged anchoring flap 
(9) when closed. 
A sealing cap according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the catch (18) is connected to an easy-opening tab 

(21) in the cap surface (7) surrounded by reduction lines 
(22). 
A sealing cap (1') for a safety closure including a 
sealing screw (2) having an upwardly open recess (3) 

including at least one undercut (25) on its inside edge 
forming a laterally open eye, with the plastic sealing 

cap (1') including a cap surface (7) covering the sealing 
screw (2) and a cap edge (8) overlapping the edge of the 

safety closure and at least one anchoring unit (26) 
projecting downward from the cap surface (7), engaging 

behind the undercut (25) of the sealing screw (2) when 
closed and which is fully engaged, characterised in that 

at least one anchoring tab (26) connected to the cap 
surface (7) and extending in a distance from the same, is 

used as an anchoring unit, to be inserted laterally into 
the appropriate eye (25) by rotating the sealing cap (1') 

and that the anchoring tab (26) includes a barb (27) at 
its free end engaging into the eye (25). 
A sealing cap (1'') for a safety closure including a 
sealing screw (2) having an upwardly open recess (3) and 

at least one undercut (25a) on its inner edge, with the 
plastic sealing cap (1'') including a cap surface (7)  

 
covering the sealing screw (2) and a cap edge (8) 

overlapping the edge of the safety closure and at least 
one anchoring unit (29) projecting downward from the cap 

surface (7), engaging behind the undercut (25a) of the 
sealing screw (2) when closed, which is fully engaged, 

characterised in that each anchoring unit if formed by a 
barb (29) projecting downward from the cap surface, 

engaging flexibly and fully behind an opposite undercut 
(25a) of the sealing screw (2). 
A sealing cap according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that centring projections (30) are extending downward 

from the cap surface (7), centring the sealing cap (1'') 
on the inner edge of the sealing screw.
