<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides methods and kits for determining the presence or amount of a substance by detection of a colloidal dye associated with agglutinated particles. The methods and kits are disclosed in direct and indirect (e.g., competitive) formats. In one aspect, the present invention provides methods and kits utilizing a single colloidal dye. In another aspect, methods and kits are provided which include two colloidal dyes, wherein one colloidal dye functions as a background-enhancing dye. A related aspect of the present invention provides methods and kits that include a colloidal dye and a non-water-soluble dye (which functions as a background-enhanching dye) attached to a microporous pad which permits differential migration of non-agglutinated and agglutinated latex particles. In yet another aspect, the present invention provides methods and kits utilizing a colloidal dye and a water-soluble dye, which functions as a background-enhancing dye.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the detection of the
presence or amount of substances using agglutination methods and kits. This
invention is more particularly related to the use of colloidal dyes for the
visualization or quantification of agglutinated particles and the use of microporous
pads for substantially separating the agglutinated particles.Underlying all successful therapeutic approaches is the initial
diagnosis of the particular disease. A challenge to medicine since its inception has
been to conceive of methods that permit rapid and accurate detection of diseases.
Despite advances in diagnostic technology over the years, the current techniques
for the diagnosis of many diseases are often inadequate or cost prohibitive for
wide scale application.Many diagnostic techniques involve detection of specific substances
which may be present, or at least elevated in concentration, in only the disease
state. Typically, detection of a substance itself, a molecule which recognizes the
substance, or a reaction between the substance and the molecule, necessitates
amplification in order to produce detectable levels. One approach to
amplification is to use polymer particles having a molecule which recognizes a
substance bound thereto. Such particles, when in the presence of the substance,
will clump together (also known as agglutination) from an otherwise
homogeneous solution. Agglutination may be detectable by visualizing the
clumped particles directly or indirectly via dyed particles.Subsequent to the introduction of the first diagnostic latex
agglutination test, a number of different latex agglutination tests have been
developed see e.g. EP-A-0 174 195; EP-A-0 293 779; EP-A-0 396 801; Journal of Chromatography 1986,376,175-189. However, most of the latex slide tests can be difficult to interpret and
the length of the required "hands on time" can lead to false positives (i.e., a result
is obtained which indicates that a substance is present in a sample when in fact it
is not). Other tests may be easier to interpret, but are costly to manufacture.
Thus, there is a need in the art for detection assays and kits which are rapid, 
accurate, cost-effective, and convenient. The present invention fulfills these needs
and further provides other related advantages.Briefly stated, the present invention provides a variety of methods
and kits for determining the presence or amount of a substance in a biological
fluid. The methods and kits of the present invention may be in a direct or indirect
test format.In
