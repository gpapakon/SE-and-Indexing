<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymerization to obtain a crosslinkable polymer. The invention is particularly useful for preparing polymers for coatings and other curable compositions. The invention employs Ï‰-unsaturated macromonomers as a chain transfer agent. Such macromonomers have a variety of uses, including controlling the molecular weight of polymers.In any polymerization process, it is necessary to be able to control the molecular weight of the polymer produced so that it may be fitted to a particular use or need. For example, in unperturbed polymerization systems which fundamentally tend to produce high molecular weight polymers, it may be desirable or necessary to limit the molecular weight of the polymers produced, and this must be done in a fairly predictable and controllable fashion. Such molecular weight limitation may be desirable or necessary in the preparation of polymer solutions for use in paints and finishes which require high solids content to assure reduced solvent emission during application and yet which require low viscosity to facilitate ready application.In free radical polymerizations, there are a number of conventional means of effecting such molecular weight limitation. These, along with notable disadvantages or problems, include
(1) A high initiator/monomer ratio. However, this may be costly in terms of initiator consumption. Also, high initiator levels may also produce undesirable end groups on the polymers produced.(2) Polymerization at high temperatures. However, this may lead to undesirable depropagation, thermal initiation, and undesirable secondary reactions.(3) Adding stoichiometric amounts of thiol chain transfer agents to the polymerizing system. However, the attendant incorporation of sulfur-containing agents into the polymer may render it less durable than is desired. There may also be odor problems associated with the use of sulfur-coataining chain transfer agents.(4) Chain transfer agents employing cobalt (II) chelates such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,680,352 and U.S. Patent 4,694,054. However, a possible disadvantage of these is that some do not work in water and some are adversely affected or deactivated by low pH. They may cause color problems, especially if interaction with some monomers may require higher levels of the cobalt chelate.(5) Group transfer agents such as disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,417,034 and 4,414,372 or European patent application publication 0 248 596. However, they are specific to methacrylated polymers and relatively expensive. They are
