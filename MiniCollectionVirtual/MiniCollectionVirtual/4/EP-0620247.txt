<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions of mixed 
metal salts which exhibits improved storage stability, and 
to the use of such compositions as a stabilizer for polymers. Mixed metal salts of carboxylic acids are useful for 
many purposes. In particular mixed metal salt of carboxylic 
acids having at least 6 carbon atoms have been used as 
industrial soaps and greases in various applications, 
including use as stabilizers for polyvinyl chloride and 
other chlorine containing polymers. Often the salts are 
overbased, as described hereinafter, and often such salts 
are used in the form of a concentrate, e.g. with an amount 
of oil sufficient to provide a mobile, homogeneous, pourable, 
and handleable material. While such mixed salts and compositions are very 
useful, problems are sometimes encountered. In particular 
the stability of certain combinations of metal salts to 
standing or storage can be inadequate due to fundamental 
incompatibility among the metal salts employed. Such 
incompatibility can be exhibited in oil formulations by 
development over time of turbidity, increased viscosity, or 
insoluble solids. As a result the composition is no longer 
an easily-handled, homogeneous, readily pourable liquid and 
must be specially treated in order to be used. Even in the 
absence of added oil certain mixed salts can exhibit 
deleterious interactions. The present invention provides 
a composition of mixed metal salts in which such problems 
are minimized or completely eliminated and which, accordingly, 
is superior for various uses including use as a 
polymer stabilizer. Various references have reported the use of carboxylate 
salts as polymer stabilizers, and various problems 
encountered therein. French publication 2,376,178, July 
28, 1978 discloses chemical stabilizers that protect  
 
halogenated vinyl polymers from rapid decomposition due to 
exposure to heat, comprising a tin complex or a complex of 
antimony, a hydrochloric acid acceptor, an organic chelating 
agent, and a lubricant. The hydrochloric acid acceptor 
is a salt of an alkali or alkaline earth metal or Zn, Cd, 
or Pb oxides, which can be cleaved by HCl. It is also 
possible to use superbasic salts. The organic chelating 
agent captures the metal chlorides produced during thermal 
degradation and forms stable and inoffensive complexes. 
Suitable agents include oxycarboxylic acids, polyols, 
polyamines, and organic phosphites. U.S. Patent 2,669,549, Darby et al., February 1954, 
discloses PVC stabilized with zinc stearate and
