<ABSTRACT>
The wall cladding (10) has anchoring brackets, fastened on a structural wall (11), and wall-cladding panels (14) which are accommodated on said brackets such that they are spaced apart from one another, in doing so forming joints (15). Said wall-cladding panels (14) are provided on the rear with load-bearing profiles (16), extending essentially over the entire panel width or length, and are connected, in the region of the joints (15), to the anchoring brackets (25) by means of retaining elements which engage in a positively locking manner into end plug-in receiving means of said load-bearing profiles (16). The retaining elements have plug-in pins which jut out towards opposite sides from a central part, which is fastened on the anchoring bracket (25), and the plug-in pins of one retaining element engage into the end plug-in receiving means of the load-bearing profiles (16) of adjacent wall-cladding panels (14).
