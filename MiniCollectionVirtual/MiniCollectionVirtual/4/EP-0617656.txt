<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and process is provided for the production of hot mix asphalt (HMA) by the treatment of virgin material alone or adding reclaimed or recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) of up to 100 % of the HMA comprised of reclaimed asphaltic pavement (RAP). The HMA is first heated in either a parallel (10) or a counter flow rotating drum (102) which is supplied with hot combustion gases generated by a remote low NOx burner (11, 104). The temperature of hot gases entering the drum is from about 400 to 2,000  DEG F, and the temperature of gases exiting from the drum is from about 130 to 220 DEG F. The HMA material optionally can be subjected to microwave radiation (29) to raise the material to a final temperature, or optionally to only reorient the dipolar molecules of the material without any measurable heating of the material. The exhaust gas is treated and made environmentally safe. The hot gases exiting from the drum are passed through a knockout box and then through a baghouse (40) having acrylic bags coated with a protective layer of particulate material. The gases exiting the baghouse (40) are passed through an oxidizer to further remove smoke and asphaltic material and at least a portion of the gases from the oxidizer are recycled through a heat exchanger.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING HOT MIX ASPHALT"FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention is in the field environmentally safe hot ψ- mix asphalt (HMA) plants which can use virgin aggregate and/or recycled asphaltic pavement (RAP) . More particularly, " this invention relates to an HMA plant using a counter flow5 drum and an external burner where the hot gases of combustion exit the drier drum at the same end that the cold asphalt enters the drums, and the exiting gases carry out excess fumes.The field of recycling asphalt pavement (RAP) requires 10 that the process not pollute the atmosphere with hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and other objectionable gases such as nitrous oxides. It is therefore essential to maintain these emissions at an absolute minimum in order to comply with anti pollution regulations in many state and 15 local jurisdictions.This invention relates to a method of producing hot mixed asphalt pavement (HMA) , more particularly where recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) is used, such that there is little or no air pollution in the form of smoking or 20 production of carbon monoxide, or production of N0χ by the burner used to heat the drum.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTPrior Art - NAPA// The conventional practices of the prior art are25 generally shown in a publication by the National AsphaltPavement Association (NAPA) located at 6811 KenilworthAvenue, Riverdale, MD 20737 in a book entitled "TheFundamentals of the Operation and Maintenance of Exhaust GasSystem in a Hot Mix Asphalt Facility", 2nd ed., 1987,30 incorporate herein by reference. NAPA at page 3 teaches that the most efficient means of drying and heating aggregate is 

 to apply direct heat. It states that this is accomplished with a burner that directs the flame into the drum. This, however, is against the teachings of applicant which places the burner and flame outside the drum and adds substantial quantities of ambient air in order to cool the combustion gases prior to contact with the material and the drum. At page 1.1 NAPA teaches that in drum facilities it is necessary to avoid quenching of the flame. Applicant however, teaches quenching of flame prior to even entry into the drum in order to avoid overheating of the material. At pages 1-7 NAPA teaches that improper operation of the burner negatively impacts the overall efficiency of the HMA manufacturing process. Excessive amounts of air, far beyond what is needed for complete combustion of the fuel, are improper and wasteful. This is a teaching away from applicant's invention

CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. An apparatus for the manufacture of hot mix asphalt (HMA) using either virgin material, recycled asphaltic pavement (RAP) or a combination of both, comprising: a) a rotary drum heater for heating the HMA, the drum heater comprising a flame producing combustion burner means located with respect to the rotary drum so that the flame does not extend into the rotary drum heater; b) a drum having HMA flowing through the drum a HMA output; c) a HMA input, a combustion gas and vapor output located at the opposite end of the drum as the HMA output; and d) a means to transfer HMA to the rotary drum heater HMA input.
2. A low NO
χ
 dryer drum for heating hot mix asphalt (HMA) materials comprising in combination: a) a counter flow rotating drum dryer having a HMA input and output and having a gas input and exhaust; b) a low N0
X
 burner means for producing a flame; c) a combustion gas supply means for supplying a quantity of air to the burner means which produces complete combustion at a temperature which is below that which produces NO
x
 in the combustion flame; herein the burner is located at a position with respect to the drum dryer which prevents the flame from entering the drum; and d) a means for supplying the combustion gases to the dryer drum gas input.
3. A process of drying and heating recycled asphaltic pavement (RAP) to form a hot mix, with low hydrocarbon emissions into the atmosphere, the steps comprising: a) passing the hot mix through a rotating drying drum having flights for raising the hot mix 


 toward the top of the drum and allowing it to fall to the bottom of the drum; and b) passing hot gases through the drum in a direction opposite to the hot mix, thereby producing a counter flow of RAP and hot gases in the drum, the hot gases entering the drum at a temperature of from about 400 to 2,000°F and having temperature spikes in the hot gas no greater than about ± 100°F from the mean temperature of the hot gas, and the hot gas exiting the drum at a temperature of from about 130 to 220°F. 4. In a process of drying and heating recycled asphaltic pavement (RAP) to form a hot mix, with low hydrocarbon emissions, into the atmosphere wherein hot gases are passed through a drum in a direction opposite to RAP, the further steps comprising: a) discharging the hot gases from the drum at temperature of from about 160-200°F, b) passing the hot gases from the drum through a knockout box, whereby to remove particulate material from the hot gases, c) passing the hot gases from the knockout box through bags in a baghouse to further remove fines from the hot gases, said baghouse having a particulate coating thereon of a particulate material comprising SiO and A1

5. The process of Claim 4, wherein hot gases discharging from the drum are at a temperature of from about 190-200°F.
6. The process of Claim 4, wherein hot gases are passed from the knockout box upwardly and then through a goose-neck shaped passage and into the baghouse.
