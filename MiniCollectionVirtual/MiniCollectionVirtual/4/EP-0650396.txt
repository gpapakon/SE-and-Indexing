<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the study of
cellular and biochemical processes in living cells or
in components of cells. Specifically described are
devices and methods for the study of cellular and
biochemical processes, utilising the Scintillation
Proximity principle.Mammalian cell culture is an essential tool
for fundamental research in eukaryotic biology and it
has contributed to advances in virology, somatic cell
genetics, endocrinology, carcinogenesis, toxicology,
pharmacology, immunology and developmental biology
(McKeehan, W.I., In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol., 26, 9-23,
(1990)). Classical cell culture technology is carried
out in nutrient mixtures with cells usually cultured as
a monolayer attached to a hydrophilic surface, commonly
sterile treated polystyrene. Considerable progress has
been made in developing cell culture systems for
specific cell types, with the aim of reconstructing the
cell and its environment into a defined unit for the
study of responses and properties of cells in a dynamic
context. However, experimentation on such culture
systems using biological assays is often limited by the
need to use invasive or disruptive processes that
compromise the structural and functional integrity of
the cells. Certain types of investigations lend
themselves particularly to studies with whole cells and
inevitably require cell culture techniques as an
essential step in the investigation. General areas of
study include:
(i) intracellular activity, including the
replication and transcription of nucleic acids, protein
synthesis and lipid metabolism,(ii) intracellular flux, ie. movement of RNA from
cell nuclei to the cytoplasm, translocation of human
receptor complexes, fluctuations in lipid and protein
metabolic pools, transport of ions and other small
molecules across membranes,(iii) environmental influences, including
nutrition, infection, virally or chemically induced
transformation, drug action and metabolism, response to
external stimuli and secretion of specialised products,
and(iv) cell-cell interaction, including embryonic
induction, cell population kinetics, cell-cell adhesion
and motility.A vast array of radiolabelled ligands which
are available commercially, has played a major role in
the development of methods currently used to study
intracellular activity, metabolism and cell-ligand
interactions in cell culture assay systems. Particular
examples relating to the study of cellular processes
are:Studies involving the measurement of
[3H]thymidine uptake currently suffer from an absolute
