<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of a terpolymer as a single or auxiliary foaming agent in aqueous hair or skin treatment compositions, packaged in an aerosol device and capable of forming a foam after expanding upon exposure to air. Said terpolymer is composed of 25 to 90 % vinyl lactam, 1 to 55 % unsaturated carboxylic acid and 1 to 20 % alkyl acrylate or methacrylate containing at least 6 carbon atoms. Cosmetic or dermatological compositions packaged in an aerosol device, foaming upon exposure to air and containing the terpolymer are also described.

Use as sole or additional foaming agent in
aqueous compositions for treating the skin or the hair,

which are packaged in an aerosol device and are capable
of forming a foam after expansion into the air, of a

terpolymer consisting of 25 to 90% of vinyl lactam, of 1
to 55% of unsaturated carboxylic acid and of 1 to 20% of

alkyl acrylate or methacrylate containing at least 6

carbon atoms.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the unsaturated carboxylic acids are chosen from acrylic

acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid or crotonic acid.
Use according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in

radicals.
Composition intended for treating the hair or the
skin, which is packaged in a pressurized device as an

aerosol in the presence of a propellent, characterized in
that it contains, in a cosmetically acceptable aqueous

medium, at least one terpolymer consisting of 25 to 90%
of vinyl lactam, of 1 to 55% by weight of unsaturated

carboxylic acid and of 1 to 20% of alkyl acrylate or
methacrylate containing at least 6 carbon atoms, so as to

form a foam after expansion into the air.

terpolymer a foam having a density of less than 

or equal to 0.3 g/cm
2
