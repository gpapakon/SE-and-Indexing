<ABSTRACT>
Diketopyrrolopyrroles of the formula 
<
IMAGE
>
  in which R1, R2, R3 and R4 independently of one another are hydrogen, chlorine, C1-C4-alkyl, methoxy, phenyl, cyano or a group  -X1-V-X2-T-A and at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 contains the group A, and A is a group of the formula 
<

>
 in which Y is O., OH or OR and R is C1-C12-alkyl or C5-C12-cycloalkyl. For the meaning of X1, X2, V, T, Q and Z refer to Claim 1. These diketopyrrolopyrroles are suitable both as pigments having excellent resistance to light and weather, and as light stabilisers in mixtures with other diketopyrrolopyrroles.
