<DESCRIPTION>
Related co-pending US-A-5 326 947 
filed on even date herewith 
discloses one class of material 
compositions which is suitable for use in the present 
application. The entire teaching and disclosure of that 
co-pending application is incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates to circuit 
breakers, circuit interrupters, electrical distribution 
devices and the like, and more particularly, to an arc 
extinguishing device having an improved design for use 
therein. Circuit breakers are commonly used to protect 
branch circuits in residential and commercial buildings 
against overload and fault conditions. Basically, a 
circuit breaker includes a separable pair of electrical 
contacts, a spring-operated mechanism for effecting 
separation of the contacts, and a tripping mechanism upon 
the occurrence of the overload or fault condition. A 
representative circuit breaker is fully set forth in U.S. 
Patent No. 2,889,429, issued to Kingdon et al. and U.S. 
Serial No. 722,050, issued October 26, 1992, to Cook et 
al., both commonly assigned to the assignee herein and 
incorporated herein by reference. Circuit interrupters are also known from US-A-3 071 666.  
 An electric arc is produced each time the circuit 
breaker contacts are opened or closed. The detrimental 
effects from the arc on other internal components is most 
severe during interruption of the electrical contacts. An 
arc extinguishing mechanism is used to control and 
extinguish the arc and protect the other components of the 
circuit breaker. For example, a common type of arc shield, which 
is placed in a recess or arc chamber of a circuit breaker 
is a series of spaced magnetic plates as illustrated in 
U.S. Patent No. 2,811,607 issued to Dorfman et al. Another 
type or arc extinguishing mechanism is set forth in U.S. 
Patent No. 2,898,427 issued to Nadeau, which discloses a 
one-piece u-shaped magnetic metallic member having a 
plurality of parallel slots with an arc runner portion to 
lead the arc to a venting passage. U.S. Patent No. 
2,429,722 to Jennings discloses an arc extinguisher using 
insulating side members mounted between the legs of 
u-shaped magnetic members and the side walls of the breaker 
casing. Another example is U.S. Patent No. 4,616,200 
issued to Fixemer et al. which discloses a molded arc 
barrier projecting into the arc chamber to shield the 
operating mechanism of the circuit breaker. The need arises to distribute more power through 
enclosures which are the same size or smaller. This 
requires
