<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for determining auto-antibodies against anti-TSH-receptor auto-antibodies in a human serum or plasma sample. Thus the auto-antibodies to be determined in the sample compete with a TSH-competitor that may be labelled with an appropriate label for the binding sites of a solubilised TSH-receptor. The amount of auto-antibodies to be determined is calculated from the amount of competitor bound to the TSH-receptor or extracted from the liquid phase. In order to prepare the reaction mixture, the sample, the optionally labelled TSH-competitor and the TSH-receptor are simultaneously mixed and the thus obtained reaction mixture is subjected to one-stage incubation then processed in a manner known per se.
