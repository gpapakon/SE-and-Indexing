<ABSTRACT>
A method and a circuit for training the tap coefficient of an
adaptive equalizer, which are characterized in that both the target

impulse response window and the filter coefficient window are made
fixed after a predetermined condition is satisfied. Thereby, the

convergence of training can be avoided from being late due to the
affect such as noise etc. The predetermined condition includes:

(1)when the ratio of power outside the window of target impulse
response and power inside the window of target impulse response is

less than a predetermined value, (2)when the ratio of power outside
the window of filter coefficient and power inside the window of filter

coefficient is less than a predetermined value, and (3) when the loop
of the impulse response update step, the impulse response window step,

the filter coefficient update step and the filter coefficient window
step is repeated a predetermined number of times.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and a circuit for training
the tap coefficient of an adaptive equalizer, and more particularly
to a method and a circuit for training the parameter of a time-domain
equalizer used to correct a distortion in receive signal caused by
the transmission characteristic of channel mainly in a multicarrier
modulation transmission system.A conventional method for training the parameter of time-domain
equalizer used in a multicarrier modulation transmission system and
its problem will be explained below.At first, the multicarrier modulation transmission system is
explained briefly below, while it is described in detail in J.A.C.
Bingham, "Multicarrier Modulation For Data Transmission", IEEE
Commun. Mag., pp.5-14, May, 1990.A multicarrier modulation signal can be produced most simply
by using an inverse fast Fourier transform (hereinafter referred to
as 'IFFT'). Input digital data are grouped into parallel-data blocks
called symbols for every predetermined bit number. One symbol
parallel data is divided into several bit groups. Then, each of
carrier signals of same number with different frequencies is
modulated with each of the bit groups.For example, if one symbol is of a 512-bit binary signal, each
two bit from the top in this one symbol is assigned to each of 0 to 
255th of 256 carrier frequencies. For the 2-bit logics {0,0}, {0,1},
{1,0} and {1,1}, the amplitude and phase of the corresponding carrier
signals are made 1+j, 1-j, -1+j and -1-j. Here, j represents an
imaginary number, and for example, 1+j represents a carrier signal
with an amplitude of √2 and an phase of +45°. It should be noted
that for any of 2-bit logics {0,0}, {0,1}, {1,0} and {1,1}, the
amplitude of carrier signal is √2 and the carrier signal is not
amplitude-modulated by a signal to be transmitted.When a multicarrier signal phase-modulated with an original
signal to be transmitted is represented by a frequency-domain vector,
to convert one symbol of original signal to be transmitted into a
multicarrier signal is a simple conversion of digital code, but when
this signal is transmitted, IFFT is required because it is
transmitted as a time-domain analogue signal. Also, since the
frequency-domain signal is of complex number, IFFT needs to be a
complex IFFT. On the contrary, in performing a fast Fourier
transform(hereinafter referred to as 'FFT'), a complex FFT is
required.Since FFT and IFFT are performed in the technical field of this
invention, in the following explanation, a general frequency-domain
signal
