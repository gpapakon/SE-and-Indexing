<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a machine for automatically welding workpieces (P1) which it is desired to join together. This machine, which is installed "in situ", is characterised in that detection means (6) include a localisation range finder (61) capable of measuring a chosen distance (ML) between the machine (1) and one of the workpieces (P1), a welding profile (P) exhibiting a curved portion (TC) in the region of which the chosen distance is outside a given interval, while a programmable control device (7) is provided with a memory in which there are recorded the coordinates of passage points of a welding torch (40) which are distributed along the portion (TC) and in that this device possesses first computing means which make it possible, on the one hand, to determine the location of the passage points and, on the other hand, to define, by circulation extrapolation, a series of points defining curves connecting the passage points which are coincident with the curved portion (TC), so that a movement system (5) makes the successive positions of the torch (40) come into register with this part. This invention makes it possible to carry out "in situ" welding, for example for the production of membranes, for example for fluid confinement tanks.
