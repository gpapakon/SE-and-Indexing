<ABSTRACT>
Diesel engine cylinder oils of improved cleanliness and load carrying ability and reduced port deposit characteristics for use in marine and stationary slow speed diesel engines are based on medium heavy Group I or Group II neutral base oils, typically from 300 to 500 SUS using a liquid, oil-miscible polyisobutylene (PIB) in combination with the neutral base stock and an additive package comprising a detergent component or components, an antioxidant, an antiwear agent, and a dispersant. The detergent component preferably comprises one or more overbased phenates, phenylates, salicylates or sulfonates in order to confer the desired alkalinity characteristics on the finished oil. The oils are produced in the viscosity range of 15 to 25 cS (100  DEG C), usually with a nominal viscosity of 20 or 24 cS, i.e., from 18.5 to 21.9 cS or 21.9 to 26.1 cS (100  DEG C). The viscosity index of the improved oils is at least 95, typically from 105 to 120. Total Base Number of the oils is in the range 40 to 100.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DIESEL ENGINE CYLINDER OILSThis invention relates to diesel engine cylinder oils.In large, slow speed diesel engines of the crosshead type used in marine and heavy stationary applications, the cylinders are lubricated separately from the other engine components. The cylinders are lubricated on a total loss basis with the cylinder oil being injected separately to quills on each cylinder by means of lubricators positioned around the cylinder liner. Oil is distributed to the lubricators by means of pumps which are, in modern engine designs, actuated to apply the oil directly onto the rings to reduce wastage of the oil. The high stresses encountered in these engines and the use of heavy residual fuels create the need for lubricants with a high detergency and neutralizing capability even though the oils are exposed to thermal and other stresses only for short periods of time. Residual fuels commonly used in these slow speed diesel engines typically contain significant quantities of sulfur which, in the combustion process, combines with water to form sulfuric acid, the presence of which leads to corrosive wear. Cylinder oils contain high alkalinity reserves for neutralizing this acid, which is reflected in the total base number (TBN) of these oils, typically in the range of at least 30mg KOH/g, usually from 60 to 100 mg KOH/g, which is normally adequate with fuels containing two to three percent sulfur. When higher sulfur residual fuels are being used cylinder oils with TBN values of 70 are normally used although oils with TBN values up to and exceeding 100 mg KOH/g may be used, especially with high peak cylinder power ratings of 3,500kw per cylinder or more.A requirement of these cylinder oils is that they should be thin enough to spread efficiently over the cylinder surface but yet thick enough to provide a continuous hydrodynamic film that will not evaporate off the walls of the upper cylinder when exposed to high combustion temperatures. Normally, oils with a viscosity grade of SAE 50 are satisfactory for lubricating both older and newer types of engine although heavier oils such as SAE 60 are contemplated. The SAE 50 grade corresponds to oils with kinematic viscosities within the range of 18.5 to 21.9 cS (100°C), with the minimum at the lower end of the range being set by engine builder 

specifications and the upper limit by the SAE grade specification. Similarly, the SAE 60 oils will have kinematic viscosities extending over the range 21.9 to 26.1 cS (100°C). The SAE 50 oils therefore correspond to a
