<ABSTRACT>
A fixed installation (1) for changing the railway gage, being 
designed 

to allow the gage to be changed with the trains running, 
and being formed as an installation (1) located on a pit constituted 

by a reinforced concrete work on which different tracks (2,3), 
rail bearers, rails and guard rails, with different resilient 

elements (9,9'), are located, all of them being interconnected 
with a 

length of track (2) having a given gage (A) located on a side of the 
installation, while at the other end of the installation (1) there 

is a second length of track (3) of a different gage, the automatic 
change of the axle widenning being carried out on the center 

zone of the installation (1), notwithstanding the sense of the run.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a fixed installation
for changing the railway gauge as defined in claims
1 and 2, which is intended for allowing to automatically change
the gap existing between the wheels of the wheelsets,
adapting them to each of the two conventionally used
gauges.The invention applies to the technical field of
railway installations.At present, nothing is know about a fixed
installation allowing the railway vehicles to automatically
change the gap between the wheels of the wheelsets used by
the train known as TALGO.Nevertheless, there are, at present, different
installations designed for this purpose, having special
features and configurations, to be used on the wheels of
conventional wheelsets which, in general, are utilized by
all railway vehicles in an undiscriminatory manner, save,
of course, the exceptions existing in some type of railway
vehicle having specific wheels and for a specific use.An example of such prior installations can be found
in EP-A-0 594 040 where a ground facility is described for
changing the gauge of a railway car having bogies composed
of two frames movable relative to each other, i.e. they are
moved towards or away from each other, while the wheelsets
remain locked. During the gauge changing operations, the
bogies are supported on auxiliary wheels running on an
appropriate rail. Document EP-A-0 594 040 falls within the terms of Article 54(3) EPC.Nevertheless, with regard to the trains known as
Talgo, nothing is known about the existence of an 
installation allowing the gauge to be changed, and being
constituted and positioned in a fixed way.A solution to this problem would be to rely on a
fixed installation allowing to automatically modify the gap
between the wheels of the wheelsets of the trains Talgo,
adapting them conveniently to each of the two gauges.A fixed installation for changing the railway
gauge, as proposed by the invention, has the features set
forth in claims 1 and 2. Further
embodiments of the invention are described in the dependent
claims 3 to 9.In a more definite way, the fixed installation for
changing the gauge, which is the object of this invention,
is constituted by positioning on the upper part of a
reinforced concrete hollow assembly a series of elements
necessary to obtain the translation of the wheels and their
subsequent locking, the same being supported on this
assembly.At the same time, this assembly transmits the
vertical load corresponding to the vehicle weight to the
ground, when the vehicle is passing over the installation,
