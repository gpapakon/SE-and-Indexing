<ABSTRACT>
A control system for an internal combustion engine 
(1) estimates an amount of fuel adhering to the inner 

surface of the intake passage (2), as well as an amount 
of fuel evaporated from fuel adhering to the inner 

surface of the intake passage (2) and carried into the 
combustion chambers, determines an amount of supply fuel 

to be supplied to the engine (1), based upon operating 
conditions of the engine, the estimated adherent fuel 

amount, and the estimated carried-off fuel amount, and 
supplies the determined supply fuel amount into the 

intake passage (2). The control system corrects the 
estimated adherent fuel amount and the estimated 

carried-off fuel amount, in response to the valve 

operating characteristics of intake valves and/or 
exhaust valves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control system for
internal combustion engines, and more particularly to a
control system which controls the supply of fuel
injected into an intake pipe in a manner compensating
for a fuel amount adhering to the inner surface of the
intake pipe.In conventional internal combustion engines of the
type that fuel is injected into an intake pipe, there is
a problem that some of the injected fuel adheres to the
inner surface of the intake pipe, so that a required
amount of fuel cannot be drawn into the combustion
chamber. To solve this problem, there has been proposed
a fuel supply control method which estimates a fuel
amount which is to adhere to the inner surface of the
intake pipe and one which is to be drawn into the
combustion chamber by evaporation from the fuel adhering
to the intake pipe, and determines a fuel injection
amount in dependence on the estimated fuel amounts
(Japanese Provisional Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 61-126337).GB-A-2228592 also relates to a similar system in
which an adherent fuel amount is estimated based on the
quantity of fuel injected and the fuel adhesion and
evaporation rates, the adhesion rate being derived from
the throttle opening and coolant temperature, and the
evaporation rate being derived from coolant temperature,
intake air quantity and engine speed.Further, conventionally internal combustion engines
are known, in which operating characteristics of intake
valves and exhaust valves, i.e. valve timing (valve
opening/closing timing and/or valve lift) are changeable
(e.g. Japanese Provisional Patent Publication (Kokai)
No. 2-50285). It is a feature of the invention to provide a
control system for an internal combustion engine, which
is capable of accurately controlling the air-fuel ratio
of a mixture supplied to combustion chambers of the
engine, by taking into consideration the amount of fuel
adhering to the inner surface of the intake pipe as well
as the valve timing of intake valves and/or the exhaust
valves thereof.The present invention provides a control system for
an internal combustion engine having at least one
combustion chamber, an intake passage having an inner
surface, at least one intake valve and at least one
exhaust valve, the control system including supply fuel
amount calculating means for calculating an amount of
fuel to be supplied to the engine, based upon operating
conditions of the engine, adherent fuel amount
estimating means for estimating an amount of adherent
fuel adhering to the inner surface of the intake
passage,
</DESCRIPTION>

A control system for an internal combustion engine
(1) having at least one combustion chamber, an intake

passage (2) having an inner surface, at least one intake
valve, and at least one exhaust valve, said control

system including supply fuel amount calculating means
for calculating an amount of fuel to be supplied to said

engine (1), based upon operating conditions of said
engine, adherent fuel amount estimating means for

estimating an amount of adherent fuel adhering to said
inner surface of said intake passage (2), carried-off

fuel amount estimating means for estimating an amount of
carried-off fuel evaporated from fuel adhering to said

inner surface of said intake passage (2) and carried
into said combustion chamber (1), supply fuel amount

correcting means for correcting said supply fuel amount
calculated by said supply fuel amount calculating means,

based upon said adherent fuel amount estimated by said
adherent fuel amount estimating means and said carried-off

fuel amount estimated by said carried-off fuel
amount estimating means, and fuel supply means for

supplying said supply fuel amount corrected by said fuel
amount correcting means into said intake passage (2),

characterised in that the control system further
comprises:


valve operating means for changing a valve
operating characteristic of at least one of said intake

valve and said exhaust valve, and
estimated fuel amount correcting means for
correcting said adherent fuel amount estimated by said

adherent fuel amount estimating means and said carried-off
fuel amount estimated by said carried-off fuel

amount estimating means, in response to said valve
operating characteristic of said at least one said

intake valve and said exhaust valve.
A control system as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said valve operating characteristic includes a low speed 

valve timing suitable for operation of said engine (1)
in a lower rotational speed region of said engine (1),

and a high speed valve timing suitable for operation of
said engine (1) in a higher rotational speed region of

said engine (1), said adherent fuel amount and said
carried-off fuel amount being each corrected to

different values between when said low speed valve
timing is selected and when said high speed valve timing

is selected.
