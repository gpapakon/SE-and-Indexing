<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to articles for preventing 
oxidative degradation (deterioration) of antioxidant containing polyolefin 
insulation on electrical conductors such as telephone cables and electric 
power cables. Conventionally, to protect polyolefins, such as polyethylene, 
polypropylene and their various copolymers, it is known in the plastics 
industry to add antioxidant material during manufacture or processing of the 
polyolefin resin. The material often consists of mixture of additives each of 
which may inhibit oxidation of the resin in similar or in different ways. These 
antioxidant material(s) prevent degradation of the resin during, for example, 
high temperature extrusion of the insulation over a wire conductor to form 
the insulated wire. These antioxidant (also known as stabilizer) material(s) 
also help prevent cracking and peeling of the insulation, and other ill effects, 
during the service life of the insulated wire and/or cable. Such degradation 
can occur as a result of long exposure to the atmosphere even at relatively 
modestly elevated temperatures of 40° to 90°C. The most commonly used 
antioxidant materials include phenolic type antioxidants (often called 
primary antioxidants), which are often combined with a peroxide 
decomposer (a so-called synergist or secondary antioxidant). These materials, 
if used, each typically comprise about 0.1% by weight of the insulation. In more recent years, it has been discovered that the copper conductor 
in many cables has a catalytic effect on the oxidation process that thereby 
promotes premature depletion of the antioxidant composition. To counter 
this effect, so called metal deactivators (often designed to counter the specific  
 
effect of copper catalysis) are now frequently added to the polyolefin resin 
during manufacture. Also, the color pigments in many cables often have a 
catalytic effect on the oxidation that promotes degradation (as evidenced by 
embrittlement and cracking or peeling of the insulation). For these and other reasons, many cables, particularly those sections 
placed in telephone pedestal and aerial enclosures, have been found to 
deteriorate in service at a considerably more rapid rate than originally 
anticipated. An excellent review of the historical development of this 
problem is contained is "Cracking of Foamskin Polyethylene Insulations in 
Pedestals" by T. N. Bowmer, International Wire and Cable Symposium 
Proceedings 1988, Pages 475 to 485. In the Introductory section of this paper, 
it is stated
