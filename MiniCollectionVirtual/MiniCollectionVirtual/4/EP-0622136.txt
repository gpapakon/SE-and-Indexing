<ABSTRACT>
In the production of reinforcement meshes for reinforcement cages, the ends of the transverse rods on one side are aligned in a defined position by means of a stop element (5) and then welded to the longitudinal rods. Bending devices are then provided to bend the ends of the transverse rods. Reinforcement meshes produced in this way are particularly suitable for the mechanized production of reinforcement cages.

Device for the production of reinforcement grates 
and for the production of reinforcement cages for 

concrete slabs, having a guide for acceptance of a 
transverse wire fed from a wire distributor, and furter 

having welding devices and banding means for the 
bending transverse wire ends, characterized in that the 

guide is provided with a stopper (5) being movable in 
the direction of the longitudinal axes of the fed 

transverse wires (8) against the ends of the latter 
(8') and characterized in that the stopper (5) may be 

moved by a traversing means from an initial position 
into another previously set position and back. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
it has a threaded rod as a traversing means, leading 

through a threaded hole in the stopper element (5), and 
characterized in that it is connected to a driver motor. 
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that, on the side of the stopper 

element (5), a first bending means is arranged parallel 
to the longitudinal wires (7) of the reinforcement 

grate and that a second bending means (10) is arranged 
on the opposite side, each capable of bending the ends 

of the transverse wire (8) around the corresponding, 
outermost longitudinal wire (7''). 
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the first bending means has a bending mandrel (10) and 

a gripping or operating means, respectively, to bend 
the corresponding transverse wire ends (8') by at least 

90Â°. 
Device according to one of claims 3 to 4, 
characterized in that the second bending means has at 

least one horizontally and vertically movable bending 
mandrel, having a head part (12) with a location groove 

having at least two different outer diameters.
