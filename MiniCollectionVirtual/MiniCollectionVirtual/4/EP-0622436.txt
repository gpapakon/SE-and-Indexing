<ABSTRACT>
Use of aqueous dispersions comprising a polyurethane which is essentially composed of     a) organic polyisocyanates b) polyhydroxy compounds having a molecular weight of from above 500 to 5000 g/mol c) compounds having at least one group which is reactive toward isocyanate and having at least one ionic group or a group which is convertible into an ionic group, d) if required, compounds which differ from c) and have at least two functional groups which are reactive toward isocyanate and a molecular weight of from 60 to 500 g/mol, and at least one chelate complex comprising a polyvalent metal as the central atom and a polydentate ligand, as adhesive.

<CLAIMS>
Use of an aqueous dispersion, containing a 
polyurethane which is essentially composed of 


a) organic polyisocyanates, 
b) polyhydroxy compounds having a molecular weight of 
from above 500 to 5,000 g/mol, 
c) compounds having at least one group reactive toward 
isocyanate and having at least one ionic group or 

group convertible into an ionic group and 
d) if required, compounds which differ from (c) and 
have at least two functional groups reactive toward 

isocyanate and a molecular weight of from 60 to 
500 g/mol, 
 
and at least one chelate complex comprising a polyvalent 

metal as the central atom and a polydentate ligand, as an 
adhesive. 
Use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the content of 
the chelate complex in the dispersion is from 0.01 to 5% 

by weight, based on the polyurethane. 
An aqueous dispersion, containing a polyurethane 
and a chelate complex as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 

polydentate ligand is an acetylacetonate. 
An aqueous dispersion, containing a polyurethane 
and a chelate complex as claimed in claim 1 or 2 and in 

addition an adhesion-improving polymer. 
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in claim 4, 
wherein the adhesion-improving polymer is a phenol resin. 
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in claim 4 or 5, 
wherein the adhesion-improving polymer is added to the 

polyurethane or to a polyurethane prepolymer prior to 
dispersing in water and, in the case of the polyurethane  

 
prepolymer, the further reaction to the polyurethane is 

carried out after dispersing. 
An adhesive bond obtainable by using an aqueous 
dispersion as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5.
