<ABSTRACT>
A cable support bracket (1) has a pair of plates (2, 3) 
forming clamp jaws. The plates (2, 3) are secured 

together by locking bolts (4). A lower end (8, 9) of each 
plate (2, 3) is curved forming a grip for reception of a 

cable suspension wire. A central open-ended U-shaped slot 
(7) is provided on each plate (2, 3) for engagement with 

a bolt on a telegraph pole or the like to sit the bracket 
(1) on the bolt for supporting the wire on the pole.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cable support bracket, and in 
particular for supporting aerial telephone cables. When an aerial telephone cable is erected on a pole, at a 
roadside for example, the cable may be supported on a 
hook. The hook is generally J-shaped and has a bent lower 
portion forming a support for the telephone cable. The 
cable rests on the hook which often causes damage to the 
cable due to chaffing of the cable on the hook 
particularly in windy areas. The hook is fixed to the 
pole using a long mounting bolt 17 mm in thickness which 
passes through the hook and pole and one or more coach 
screws. To try to prevent chaffing the cable may be bound 
to the hook, using for example electric wire, however, 
this is unsatisfactory and can gradually work loose. A 
number of plastic and rubber inserts have been proposed 
for mounting within the bend of the hook and surrounding 
the cable to support the cable and prevent it from 
chaffing. A disadvantage of these is that the hook fixing 
bolt has to be removed from the pole to fit these inserts. 
It will be appreciated that as the bolts are exposed to 
the elements they are generally rusted and extremely 
difficult to remove and often have to be cut for removal. 
It is therefore a difficult and time consuming task to fit 
these inserts to existing pole-mounted hooks. The present invention is directed towards overcoming this 
problem. According to the invention there is provided a cable 
support bracket having a cable holder and means for 
securing the bracket to a support. Preferably the 
securing means is an open-ended slot for engagement with 
the support.  Conveniently, the cable holder is engageable with a cable 
to retain the cable across an inlet of the slot. Preferably, the cable holder has means to grip a cable at 
each side of the slot. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the cable 
holder is a clamp. Preferably the clamp is releasable. 
Ideally the clamp is releasably engageable with a 
suspension wire of a cable. Conveniently the clamp may be formed by a pair of movable 
jaws. Preferably the jaws have a grip portion shaped for 
reception of a cable suspension wire. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the jaws are 
formed by an associated pair of plates, each plate having 
a cable grip portion along a lower end of the plate, a 
slot for engagement with the support extending inwardly 
from a lower end of each plate, and fastener means being 
provided to secure the plates together. In a preferred embodiment the slot is

<CLAIMS>
A cable support bracket having a cable holder and 
means for securing the bracket to a support. 
A bracket as claimed in claim 1 wherein said securing 
means is an open-ended slot for engagement with the 

support. 
A bracket as claimed in claim 2 wherein the cable 
holder is engageable with a cable to retain the cable 

across an inlet of the slot. 
A bracket as claimed in claim 3 wherein the cable 
holder has means to grip a cable at each side of the 

slot. 
A bracket as claimed in any preceding claim wherein 

the cable holder is a clamp. 
A bracket as claimed in claim 5 wherein the clamp has 
a pair of movable jaws formed by an associated pair 

of plates, each plate having a cable grip portion 
along a lower end of the plate, a slot for engagement 

with the support extending inwardly from a lower end 
of each plate, fastener means being provided to 

secure the plates together. 
A bracket as claimed in claim 6 wherein the slot is 
located centrally on each jaw extending inwardly from 

an outer edge of the jaw. 
A bracket as claimed in any preceding claim wherein 
locking means is provided engageable with the support 

member and the bracket to prevent movement of the 
bracket on the support member. 
A bracket as claimed in claim 8 wherein the locking 
means comprises a pair of stops engageable with the 

support member on each side of the bracket. 
A bracket as claimed in claim 9 wherein each stop has 
means for snap engagement of the stop with the 

support member, and preferably each stop has a slot 
for reception of the support member defined by a pair 

of outwardly extending arms resiliently deformable 
for reception of the support member therebetween. 
A bracket as claimed in claim 9 or 10 wherein a 
groove is formed at a lower portion of an inner 

plate-engaging face of each stop, and preferably 
an outer support-engaging face of each stop is shaped 

for complementary interengagement with the support. 
A bracket as claimed in any preceding claim wherein 
the jaws are moveable by means of a pair of spaced-apart 

bolts passing through and engaging the jaws to 
secure the jaws together.
