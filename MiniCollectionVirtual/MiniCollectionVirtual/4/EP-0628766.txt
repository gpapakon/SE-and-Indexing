<ABSTRACT>
For a boiler arranged in a protective enclosure (1) and provided with a water filling plug (21) which is accessible from the outside of the enclosure, a safety device (30) is envisaged, comprising a deformable member (45) which is sensitive to the vapour pressure inside the boiler (2) and held in place in a hollow cylindrical sleeve (3) mounted transversely and in a fixed manner in an opening (4) made in the boiler, as well as a transverse rod (32) driven slidingly by said member (45) to occupy either a locking position, in which it locks the plug (21), or an unlocking position, in which it frees the plug (21). The sleeve (3) comprises an annular thread (41), on which a cap (39) is screwed, which passes through the access face (17) of the enclosure (1) in a watertight manner and which comprises a shaft (43) for passage of the rod (32).

Steam-producing boiler, in particular for an iron, 
comprising a boiler body (2) disposed inside a protective 

enclosure (1) and connected to the latter by a connecting piece 
(12) having a water-filling opening (19) which opens out into 

the boiler body (2) and which is closed off by a plug (21) 
accessible from outside the enclosure ; and a safety device 

including a deformable member (45) sensitive to the steam 
pressure prevailing inside the boiler body (2), and a rod (32) 

transverse to the accessibility face (17) of the enclosure (1) 
and slidably driven by the said deformable member (45) so as to 

occupy either a locking position, defined when the boiler body 
is under pressure, in which the free end (32b) of the rod (32) 

locks the plug (21), or an unlocking position, defined when the 
steam pressure inside the boiler body has fallen below a 

predetermined level, in which the free end (32b) of the rod 
(32) releases the plug (21),
 
characterised in that the deformable member (45) of the safety 

device is held in place in a hollow cylindrical sleeve (3) 
which is mounted transversely an non-removably in an opening 

(4) formed in the wall (5) of the boiler body situated opposite 
the accessibility face (17) of the enclosure, and which has, on 

its part (3a) situated outside the boiler body (2), an annular 
thread (41) onto which there is screwed a coaxial cylindrical 

piece forming a cap (39), this cap having an end part (39b) 
which passes through the said accessibility face (17) of the 

enclosure and which includes a shaft (43) for the rod (32) to 
pass. 
Steam-producing boiler according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the free end (32b) of the rod (32) of the 

safety device has the shape of a flat head which comes to be 
inserted in a recess (36) provided in the plug (21) when the 

rod (32) is occupying its locking position, and which comes to 
close off the outlet of the shaft (43) when the rod (32) is 

occupying its unlocking position.  
 
Steam-producing boiler according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that the end part (39b) of the cap (39) is 

surrounded by a sealing joint (15) mounted in an opening (16) 
formed in the accessibility face (17) of the enclosure (1), 

whilst the head (32b) of the rod (32) carries a sealing joint 
(38) which comes to bear on the said end part (39b) of the cap 

(39) when the rod (32) is occupying its unlocking position. 
Steam-producing boiler according to one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the deformable member (45) of the safety 

device consists of a hollow membrane open towards the inside of 
the boiler body (2). 
Steam-producing boiler according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that the hollow membrane (45) has the shape of 

a balloon with a cross section substantially in the shape of a 
Î©, the end edge (45a) of which is held in a gripping zone 

(47a) formed in a ring (47) mounted coaxially in the sleeve (3) 
and interposed in abutment between the other end part (39a) of 

the cap (39) and a shoulder (51) provided in the part of the 
sleeve (3) which is situated inside the boiler body (2).
