<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injector system for a combustor of a gas turbine engine 
includes first and second fuel injectors (20,22) rendered operative to 

discharge fuel to the combustor during a high power regime of engine 
operation and rendered non-operative during a lower power regime of 

engine operation. The first and second fuel injectors include respective 
first and second fuel discharge passages (84,86) in fuel flow 

communication to one another and to the combustor via associated fuel 
discharge lips (80,82) to sustain a flame region. The first and second 

fuel injectors are operatively associated with respective first and 
second air discharge means (100,102) having air discharge lips (110,112) 

for discharging air to the combustor for sustaining the flame region 
therein. When the fuel injectors are rendered non-operative during the 

lower power engine operation regime, different pneumatic pressures 
established at the fuel discharge lips generate a pressure differential 

on the fuel residing in the injectors effective to purge the resident 
fuel from the injectors into the combustor rapidly enough for ignition 

by the existing flame region in the combustor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel
injector system for a combustor of a gas turbine
engine, a gas turbine engine with such an
injector system, and a method of fueling a
combustor of a gas turbine engine.Efforts to reduce emissions and improve
combustor performance in gas turbine engines have
brought about the use of staged fuel systems wherein
one or more fuel injectors are used for low speed (low
power) engine operation and one or more other fuel
injectors are used for higher speed (higher power)
engine operation. The fuel injectors used for low
speed engine operation are commonly referred to as
pilot or primary fuel injectors for providing a
continuous fuel flow to the engine combustor for all
regimes of engine operation from idle to high speed
operation. The fuel injectors used for higher speed 
engine operation are referred to as secondary or main
injectors for providing supplemental fuel flow to the
engine combustor in an on-demand manner when higher
engine speed (power) is required. The secondary fuel
injectors thus are rendered non-operative during idle
operation of the engine when the supplemental fuel
flow is not needed and are rendered operative during
higher speed (power) engine operation when
supplemental fuel flow is required.Airblast fuel injectors have been used in
non-staged gas turbine engine fuel systems and are
described in US-A-3 684 186
and US-A-3,980,233.
Airblast fuel injectors are
designed to achieve atomization of a film of liquid
fuel formed on a fuel discharge orifice surface or lip
by directing high velocity airflow supplied to the
injector from the engine compressor at the fuel film
as it leaves the orifice surface.Airblast fuel injectors have been proposed
for use in a staged gas turbine engine fuel system. 
However, use of airblast fuel injectors in a staged
fuel system may present a so-called coking problem
when the airblast fuel injectors comprise the
secondary (or main) injectors of the system that are
rendered non-operative during some engine operational
regimes (e.g., low power regime such as low speed idle
operation) and operative during other engine
operational regimes (e.g., high speed operation). In
particular, when the secondary (or main) fuel
injectors are rendered non-operative during low power
engine operation, fuel remains in the fuel discharge
passages of the injectors and can be heated by the
elevated temperature of the combustor environment to
the extent that the fuel in the fuel discharge
passages is carbonized (coked) over time, building up
carbonace
