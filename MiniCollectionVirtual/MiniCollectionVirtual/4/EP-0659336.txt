<ABSTRACT>
Cubicle assembly for heavy livestock, comprising a number 
of partition members, such as frameworks, for dividing the 

cubicles for the animals, wherein for stiffening the 
partition are connected to one another by means of connecting 

means which are located outside the range of movement 
of the body of the animal concerned, further comprising 

connecting means for steering the animal concerned to a 
lying position, which means comprise leg impeding means, 

which are arranged on or mearby the cubicle bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cubicle assembly for heavy
livestock. In suchlike cubicle assemblies the cow shed is
divided by means of cubicle partitions divided into a
series of cubicles located next to one another. The cubicle
partitions are usually formed by frameworks, which are
either supported by a leg on the shed floor or on the
cubicle bed or attached to the shed wall at the end facing
away from the entrance to the cubicle or to continuous
structure members such as fastening pipes extending transverse
to the cubicle partitions, in which case these are
so-called leg-free cubicle partitions.Cubicles are part of a so-called lying box or cubicle
shed, also called a loose housing. The cows are fed at a
location remote from the lying boxes or cubicles, and
after feeding can walk through walking and dung channels
to a lying box or cubicle where they can lie down for
ruminating. A cubicle assembly as described in the preamble of
claim 1 is known from EP-A-437 298Usually a shoulder beam which extends in a direction
transverse to the partitions is attached to the upper side
of the cubicle partitions in order to ensure that a cow,
which has entered a cubicle, will use the space concerned
for lying. This shoulder beam is located at such a height
that if the cow moves headfirst from the entrance side or
rear of the cubicle towards the front or head side of the
cubicle, it will touch this beam and thereby will be
forced downward, at which it will lower its knees for
lying down. If the cubicle partitions are not attached to
a shed wall, generally at the head end another elongated
structure member extending transversely to the cubicle
partitions will be arranged which is called a head beam
and forms a front boundary for the space of movement of
the cow's head for forcing the cow into a lying position 
in conjunction with the shoulder beam by providing a
visual obstacle for the cow and for preventing the cow
from shifting itself up too far in the cubicle in which
case its rear would not be in a desired position any more
as regards the dung removing means located at the rear
side.It has appeared that if after a while the cow wants to
stand up again, it will be troubled by the shoulder beam.
Here a consideration is also that the cow, when standing
up, will first of all stretch its hind legs and only after
that its front legs. In the case of restless livestock it
can often happen that a cow feels threatened from behind
when standing up and consequently makes an uncontrolled
forward movement. If during this manoeuvre

<CLAIMS>
Cubicle assembly (1; 11; 21; 31) for heavy livestock, comprising a
number of partition members, such as frameworks (7; 17; 27; 37), for dividing

the cubicles for the animals, wherein for stiffening
the partition members are connected to one another by

means of connecting means (18; 28) which are located outside the
range of movement of the body of the animal concerned,

further comprising means for steering the
animal concerned to a lying position,

characterized in that said steering
means comprise

leg impeding means (9; 19a; 29a; 39), which are arranged on or nearby the
cubicle bed (2; 12; 22; 32).
Cubicle assembly according to claim 1, wherein the area
between the partition members (7; 17; 27; 37), that is covered by the

movement of the shoulder and the back of the animal concerned
is free of connecting means between the partition

members.
Cubicle assembly according to claim 2, wherein the
lower limit of that area is at a height of 1.30 to 1.70 m

above the cubicle bed (2; 12; 22; 32).
Cubicle assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the leg impeding means are formed an

elongated structure member which extends above the cubicle
bed, such as a pipe (19a) extending above the cubicle bed or a

beam (9; 29; 39) placed on the cubicle bed.
Cubicle assembly according to claim 4, wherein the
elongated structure member (9; 19a; 29; 39) extends up to 15 to 25 cm above

the cubicle bed.
Cubicle assembly according to claim 4 or 5, wherein the
elongated structure member (9; 19a; 29; 39) is disposed at approximately

1.5 to 2 m, preferably 1.7-1.9 m from the rear end of the
partition members (7; 17; 27; 37). 
Cubicle assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the partition members (7; 17; 27; 37) are connected to one

another by an upper beam.
Cubicle assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the means for steering the animal to a

lying position comprise means, which form a visible obstacle
or the animal arranged at the front of the cubicle (1; 11; 21; 31).
Cubicle assembly according to claim 8, wherein the said
means comprise a head beam, cubicle wall or the like.
Cubicle assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the cubicle bed (2; 12; 22; 32) slopes upwards from the

rear to the front.
