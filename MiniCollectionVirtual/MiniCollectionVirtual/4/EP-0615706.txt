<ABSTRACT>
A slide fastener which permits easy attachment of electric 
conductors and ensures supply of electric current against all metallic 

coupling elements even if a part of the electric conductors (5) 
is cut off. And it has a neat appearance because the electric conductors 

exposed in spaces among the coupling elements do not look 
unsightly. In the slide fastener having a fastener tape (t), a core 

cord (3) and metallic coupling elements (e) disposed along a longitudinal 
edge of one side of the fastener tape(t), a plurality of 

electric conductors (5) are used as a part of warps of the fastener 
tape (t), and the exposed portions of the electric conductors (5) 

are shifted with respect to one another in the longitudinal 
direction. Therefore, the electric conductors (5) are 

substantially continuously exposed on the front surface of the 
core cord (3) and weaved in the fastener tape body (t1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a slide fastener provided with metallic 
coupling elements onto which electro-chemical surface treatment such 
as anodized film forming, electrolytic plating, electrodeposition 
coating or the like is carried out. In the slide fastener with a plurality of metallic coupling 
elements attached at regular intervals along the longitudinal edge 
of one side of the fastener tape, when electro-chemical surface 
treatment such as anodized film forming, electrolytic plating, 
electrodeposition coating or the like is carried out for each metallic 
coupling element, it is required to apply an electric current to each 
of the metallic coupling element. Therefore, electric conductors 
are arranged along the longitudinal edge of one side of the fastener 
tape provided with the coupling elements. The prior art exemplifying the slide fastener having the electric 
conductors arranged along its edge are disclosed, for example, in 
Japanese Utility Model Publication No.S59-27136 and in the United 
States Patent No.2264324. According to the disclosed structure, the 
electric conductors are attached on and along the core cord of the 
fastener tape or wound helically around the core cord, so that they 
are protruded on the surface of the core cord.  In die-casting of metallic coupling elements, the fastener tape 
is sandwiched between upper and lower metal molds to cast plural 
coupling elements at regular intervals therealong. Then, concave 
grooves are formed between cavities of the upper and lower metal 
molds for fastener coupling elements to fit the longitudinal edge 
of one side of the fastener tape therein. When the longitudinal 
edge of one side of the fastener tape is inserted into the concave 
grooves, electric conductors protruded on the front surface must 
cut into the core cord without protruding from the concave grooves 
and the upper and lower metal molds must be firmly contacted with 
each other in clamping thereof. However, with the prior art examples, the protruded electric 
conductors might be cut off by being not completely received in the 
concave grooves and sandwiched between the edges of the concave 
grooves of the upper and lower metal molds. Therefore, it was impossible 
to carry out the successive electrolytic plating. In the metallic coupling elements of pressed products, a plurality 
of fastener coupling elements are planted at regular intervals 
by caulking their legs while the electric conductors are attached 
along the longitudinal edge of the cord side of the
