<ABSTRACT>
Motor vehicle seat support made of a bearing frame on which front forks (13) and rear forks (14) are arranged in order to interact respectively with a fixing rod (3, 4) integral with the floor (11) of the vehicle, each of which forks has a lock (15, 16) which can move in order to immobilise the fork (13, 14) with the corresponding rod, and a means (18, 20) for operating the lock (15, 16) to bring the latter into the unlocked position so as to allow the fork (13, 14) to be disengaged relative to the support rod (3, 4), characterised in that the front and rear forks (13, 14) are carried by two lower guide rails (21, 21') in contact with upper guide rails (22, 22') braced apart by a base (25) for holding the seat.

A motor vehicle seat support formed by a carrier frame on which 
front forks (13) and rear forks (14) are arranged to co-operate 

respectively with a fixing bar (3, 4) which is fixed with respect to the 
floor (11) of the vehicle, each thereof carrying a locking member (15, 

16) which is movable to lock the fork (13, 14) to the corresponding bar, 
and a means (18, 20) for operating the locking member (15, 16) to move it 

into the unlocked position so as to permit disengagement of the fork (13, 
14) with respect to the support bar (3, 4), characterised in that the 

front and rear forks (13, 14) are guided by two lower guide rails (21, 
21') in contact with upper guide rails (22, 2
2') braced by a retaining 
base (25) of the seat which has two upstanding lateral edges (26, 26'), 

front and rear secondary fling supports (27, 28; 28, 28') integrated in 
said edges (26, 26'), and slots (31, 31') which are carried by said 

secondary supports and which are transversely aligned and which have an 
opening for introduction of two longitudinally displaced transverse 

members (32, 32') which are respectively carried by the seat. 
A support according to claim 1 characterised in that two 
transversely aligned secondary supports (28, 28') are limited by a guide 

ramp (33, 33') which is oriented towards a pivoting locking member (34, 
34') for closure of the transversely aligned slots (31, 31') carried by 

the other two secondary supports (27, 27'). 
A support according to both of clams 1 and 2 characterised in 
that it carries a first swing bar (20) for coupling and operating locking 

members (16) for locking the forks (14), a second swing bar (30) for 
operating and unlocking the upper guide rails (22, 22') with respect to 

the corresponding lower rails (21, 21'), and a third swing bar (40) for 
coupling and operating the locking members (3, 34') for closure of the 

slots (31, 31') carried by the transversely aligned secondary fixing 
supports (27, 27').
