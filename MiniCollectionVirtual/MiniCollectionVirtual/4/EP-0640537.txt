<ABSTRACT>
The vessel comprises a trough (2), with trunnions (7) on opposite walls (8) for the arms (6) supporting the part-cylindrical hatch (5). A smaller loading hatch (13,14) is formed in the main one or one of the walls. The hatch is locked shut, but opens automatically on unloading. The arms extend beyond the trunnions and below the trough bottom (16) at the rear part, so as to bear against the supporting surface in the locked position. Stops (17) can be provided on the arm ends bearing against the bottom underside in the open and shut positions.
