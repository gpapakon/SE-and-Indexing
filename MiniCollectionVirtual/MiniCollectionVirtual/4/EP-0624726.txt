<ABSTRACT>
An air filter for an internal combustion engine is proposed. The said filter has a filter element which is arranged on a housing. A clean air outlet and an untreated air inlet are located on the said housing. The untreated air inlet is provided with a screen (17). In addition, a further untreated air inlet (18) is provided, which has a flap (19). In the normal operating condition the said flap (19) closes the untreated air inlet (18). As soon as the screen clogs due to snow or ice being drawn in, a vacuum is generated in the filter housing. As a result of this vacuum, the flap (19) opens, freeing the second untreated air inlet.

<CLAIMS>
Air filter for an internal combustion engine, 
including a housing, a filter insert (11) disposed in the 

housing, a filtered air outlet (15) and at least one 
unfiltered air inlet (16), characterised in that the 

unfiltered air inlet (16) is provided with a filter (17), 
and in that an additional, alternative unfiltered air inlet 

(18) is provided, which includes a flap (19), which closes 
the additional unfiltered air inlet (18), this flap (19) 

being openable in dependence on the reduced pressure 
prevailing in the filter housing (10) in the event of the 

first unfiltered air inlet becoming congested with ice or 
snow. 
Air filter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the flap (19) is a weight-loaded flap. 
Air filter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the flap (19) is spring-loaded. 
Air filter according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a filter basket (17) has a 

mesh opening of between 0.2 and 0.5 mm. 
Air filter according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the additional unfiltered air 

inlet (18) terminates in the region of the exhaust manifold 
of the engine. 
Air filter according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the spring (28) includes at least one winding and has 

tangentially orientated portions at both ends, the portions 
being situated between a support (30), which is integral 

with the housing, and a rib (35), which acts centrally on 
the flap.  

 
Air filter according to claim 6, characterised in 
that at least one of the flap bearings is an open bearing 

(27), into which the flap shaft (25) is tangentially or 
radially inserted. 
Air filter according to claim 6, characterised in 
that at least one of the flap bearings is an offset bearing 

(26), which makes it possible for the flap shaft (25) to be 
introduced inclinedly in the axial direction. 
Air filter according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the force exerted by the 

spring acts on the flap via a reinforcing rib centrally 
disposed on the flap (24). 
Air filter according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the flap (24), including the 

mounting and the means for forcibly closing the flap, is a 
compact structural unit which is connected to the air 

intake region or is incorporated in this region. 
Air filter according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the filt
er basket (17) is locked in position in the 
unfiltered air inlet (16). 
Air filter according to claim 11, characterised in 
that the filter basket (17) is provided with a plastics 

material ring, which has locking elements connected to the 
unfiltered air inlet (16).
