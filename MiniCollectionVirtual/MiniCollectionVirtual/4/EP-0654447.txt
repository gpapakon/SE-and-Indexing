<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electro-conductive 
oxide particle comprising indium atoms, 
antimony atoms and oxygen atoms, and processes for its 
production. The electro-conductive oxide particle of the 
present invention has electron electro-conductivity and 
thus is useful as e.g. electro-conductive agents, 
antistatic agents or electric resistors for e.g. 
plastics, fibers, paper, glass or ceramics. Further, it 
is useful also as flame retardants for plastics, since it 
contains antimony pentoxide. In Zeitschrift fuer Kristallographie Bd, 118, s, 158-160 
(1963), it is reported that when a mixture of In2O3 
and Sb2O3 in a molar ratio of 1 is gradually heated to 
850°C, then calcined at 1000°C for 20 hours and 
quenched, indium antimonate InSbO4 having a rutile 
structure will be formed by a solid phase reaction of 
In2O3 and Sb2O3, and X-ray diffraction data are given.  
 
Further, Neorganisheskie Materialy, Vol. 11, No. 8 1416-1419 
(1975) reports that when a mixture or a 
coprecipitated product comprising indium oxide and an 
antimony pentoxide (Sb2O5·xH2O) with a molar ratio 
In2O3/Sb2O5·xH2O being 1, was calcined at a temperature of 
from 700 to 800°C, or from 850 to 900°C, only a mixture 
comprising a phase having a rutile structure, indium 
oxide (In2O3) and antimony oxide (Sb6O13 or Sb2O4), was 
obtained. In this report, it is disclosed that indium 
antimonate (InSbO4) is steel gray and has a strained 
rutile structure, and the X-ray refraction pattern is 
disclosed. In the above literature, it is reported that when a 
mixture or a coprecipitated product of indium oxide and 
antimony trioxide or antimony pentoxide is calcined at a 
temperature of from 700 to 1000°C, indium antimonate will 
be formed, but there is no report on electro-conductivity 
of indium antimonate. Further, it is well known that an 
indium oxide-tin oxide type oxide (ITO) having tin oxide 
doped on indium oxide, exhibits excellent electro-conductivity 
(e.g. Japanese Examined Patent Publication 
No. 212268/1982) and is widely used as a transparent 
electro-conductive film material. However, there is no 
disclosure indicating that an antimony pentoxide-doped 
indium oxide exhibits excellent electro-conductivity. US Patent No. 3,449,064 discloses that indium nitrate 
and fine diantinomy trioxide (Sb2O3) were mixed in  
 
equimolar amounts and gradually heated to 500°C to 
convert them to indium oxide and diantimony pentoxide, 
and then the mixture was cooled to room temperature, 
ground, compacted and heated in an
