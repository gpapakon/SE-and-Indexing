<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system sectioning point for electric railway catenaries which mechanically connects adjacent catenary sections of different current and/or voltage systems, but separates the potentials and, using short-circuit triggering systems in earthed protection length sections, ensures the triggering of adjacent section switches in the systems, especially for protection when running with erroneously lifted pantographs. To prevent damage either through the inappropriate connection of both current systems via the vehicle or to the vehicle itself, the invention proposes that a voltage monitor (7 or 7') which is triggered earlier in space and/or time be fitted upstream of the short-circuit triggering system (8 or 8') in the earthing section (E or E'). Here it is advantageous to use an auxiliary catenary (3), fitted in the region of the sectioning point near the live main catenary (1), which is neutral during normal operation and along which runs the pantograph of a driving vehicle and which is rendered live in sections by bridging, a condition which can be detected by the voltage monitor (7 or 7') in good time.

System divide point for overhead lines in electric railways, which 
mechanically connects, but separates in terms of potential, the mutually 

adjoining overhead line sections of different current and/or voltage 
systems and, with use of short-circuit trip systems in earthed protective 

path sections, provides for a tripping of the adjacent section 
circuitbreakers of the systems, especially for protection in the case of 

travel with inadvertently raised current collector, characterised thereby 
that a respective voltage monitoring device (7 or 7') with earlier 

tripping in terms of space and time is connected in front of each short-circuit 
tripping system (8 or 8') in the earthing section (E or E') and 

checks the occurrence of a system voltage (I or II). 
System divide point according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
there is used an auxiliary overhead line (3) which is arranged in the 

divide point region near the voltage-conducting main overhead line (1), 
is neutral in normal operation, is wiped by the current collector of a 

rail vehicle and is subjected section-by-section to voltage, which is 
detectable in advance by the voltage monitoring device (7 or 7'), by 

bridging over. 
System divide point according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby 
that the auxiliary overhead line (3) comprises, in mirror image to both 

sides as seen from the divide point centre, each time an earthed section 
(E or E'), which is delimited by insulating means (6, 5, 4 or 6', 5', 4'), 

with a current transformer (8 or 8') and a neutral section (N or N') with 
a voltage transformer (7 or 7'). 
System divide point according to claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby 
that in the case of bridging over by a current collector, for each travel 

direction initially a voltage transformer (7 or 7') in a neutral section 
(N or N') responds and the section circuitbreaker for the suppply of the 

path section, which has just been driven over, of the one system (I) and 
the overhead line path, which is subsequently to be driven over, of the 

other system (II) trips before the respective current monitoring (8 or 
8') is effective.  

 
System divide point according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that, in inversion of the principle, in the divide 

point region the main overhead line (1) is constructed to be neutral and 
the adjacently arranged auxiliary overhead line (3) is constructed to be 

voltage-conducting, and that correspondingly the main overhead line (1) 
is divided up into neutral (N) and earthed sections (E) to which 

evaluatable voltages and short circuit currents are transmissible by 
successive bridging over by the current collector.
