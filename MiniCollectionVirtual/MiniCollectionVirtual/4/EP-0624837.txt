<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application relates in general to electronic apparatus 
and in particular to a method and circuitry for reducing power 
consumption within an electronic circuit. In recent years, portable laptop computers have become increasingly 
popular. Frequently, such laptop computers are battery powered in order 
to enhance their portability. Preferably, a battery powered laptop 
computer operates for an extended period of time under battery power 
before its battery is either recharged or replaced. Accordingly, it is important to reduce power consumption within an 
electronic circuit of the laptop computer, in order to extend the period 
of time during which the electronic circuit operates before recharging or 
replacing the battery. For this purpose, some previous techniques 
disable power or disable clock signals to the electronic circuit in 
response to a specified time elapsing without sensing a particular type 
of activity. A shortcoming of such previous "timer" techniques is that 
the electronic circuit can unnecessarily consume excess power while 
waiting for the timer to expire, even when the electronic circuit is not 
performing an operation. Another shortcoming of such techniques is that some form of 
interrupt is used to reenable the power or clock signals to the 
electronic circuit in response to an immediate need for the electronic 
circuit to perform an operation. Accordingly, a delay occurs between the 
time when the electronic circuit is needed to perform an operation and 
the time at which the electronic circuit is actually reenabled. 
Consequently, performance of the electronic circuit is sacrificed by such 
previous techniques, so that they are not fully transparent to a user of 
the electronic circuit. Thus, a need has arisen for a method and circuitry in which an 
electronic circuit consumes less excess power relative to previous 
techniques. Also, a need has arisen for a method and circuitry in which 
the electronic circuit does not unnecessarily consume excess power while 
waiting for a timer to expire. Further, a need has arisen for a method 
and circuitry for reducing power consumption within an electronic  
 
circuit, in which more performance of the electronic circuit is retained 
relative to previous techniques. Moreover, a need has arisen for a 
method and circuitry for reducing power consumption within an electronic 
circuit, which are more fully transparent to a user of the electronic 
circuit relative to previous techniques. This invention provides electronic apparatus
