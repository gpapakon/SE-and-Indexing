<ABSTRACT>
An organopolysiloxane composition contains 
(A) a both end hydroxyl - blocked diorganopoly - 

siloxane, (B) an inert diorganopolysiloxane, (C) 
a silane or siloxane having at least three 

hydrolyzable functional groups, (D) an organosilane 
having at least two alkoxy groups each 

attached to a silicon atom and one mercapto 
group separated from a silicon atom by an 

alkylene group or a partial hydrolyzate thereof, 
(E) an organosilane having at least two alkoxy 

groups each attached to a silicon atom and one 
amino group separated from a silicon atom by an 

alkylene group or a partial hydrolyzate thereof, 
(F) a condensation catalyst, and (G) a fine 

powder, typically of polycarbonate, having a 
mean particle size of 0.1 - 50 µm. The 

composition is useful as a surface treating 
agent for cured rubber moldings for imparting 

non - tackiness, water repellency and lubricity 
to the rubber surface and forming a long-lasting 

abrasion resistant coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to organopolysiloxane
compositions which may be useful as surface treating
agents e.g. for imparting non-tacky, water repellent, and
lubricating properties to a cured rubber surface and
forming an abrasion resistant coating. It also relates to
rubber articles having such a coating. Other aspects
concern the preparation and use of the compositions.Inert silicone oil and various curable
organopolysiloxane compositions have been used
for imparting non-tackiness and water
repellency to rubber surfaces.Inert silicone oil has high initial
wear properties, but does not last long since it
is readily shed from the substrate surface by
physical actions as weak as water washing.The curable organopolysiloxane 
compositions used heretofore are typically those
containing a both end hydroxyl-blocked
diorganopolysiloxane, a Si-H group-containing
organopolysiloxane and/or an organoalkoxysilane,
and an organic tin compound. These compositions
form on the substrate surface coatings which are
acceptably tack-free and water repellent, but
poor in lubricity and wear resistance. It is
possible to improve adhesiveness to a
substrate and lubricity, giving wear
resistance, by adding a mixture or reaction
product of an organopolysiloxane having an epoxy
group such as glycidoxy group and epoxycyclohexyl
group and alkoxysilane or siloxane having
an amino group (Japan Kokoku Nos. 54-43023,
56-19813 and 56-47864), but the improvement is
not yet fully attained. It is also possible to
improve lubricity and wear resistance by adding
inert silicone oil to such organopolysiloxane
compositions containing a both end hydroxylblocked
diorganopolysiloxane, a Si-H group-containing
organopolysiloxane and/or an
organoalkoxysilane, and an organic tin compound
(JP-A-62/215667), but the coatings
are not satisfactorily durably wear resistant 
where frictional forces are repeatedly applied.Our general aim is to provide new organopolysiloxane
compositions, in particular useful for surface coating,
also methods of preparing and using them and the
resulting articles.In a first aspect the invention provides an
organopolysiloxane composition comprising
(A) 100 parts by weight of diorganopolysiloxane of
the following general formula (1):

wherein R1 are substituted or unsubstituted monovalent
hydrocarbon groups and m is in the range 150 to 10,000;(B) 5 to 80 parts by weight of diorganopolysiloxane
of the following general formula (2):

wherein R1 are substituted or unsubstituted monovalent
hydrocarbon groups and n is equal to or
