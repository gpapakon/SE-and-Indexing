<ABSTRACT>
In the spraying of liquids, especially of small volumes, the ultrasound emitted by a piezoceramic is transmitted via a sealing medium into a housing part receiving the liquid to be sprayed. There, if the sealing material is arranged near the centre of emission, the ultrasound leads to a destruction of the housing part. If the sealing material is arranged further away, this leads, in the gap region then obtained, to an accumulation of liquid and bacteria. For this purpose, provision is made, according to the invention, for an elastic material (20) having gas inclusions to seal off an interspace (22) between the housing part (8) and the piezoceramic (16) against the liquid (10) to be sprayed. As a result of the elasticity of the material having gas inclusions, this brings about a sealing-off relative to the liquid to be sprayed. On account of the gas inclusions, an input of ultrasound into the housing part is avoided, because the ultrasound is reflected on the gas inclusions. Such ultrasonic sprays are suitable for the spraying of liquids, especially for the spraying of medicines and cosmetics.

<CLAIMS>
Ultrasonic sprayer (2) having a housing part
(8) to hold a liquid (10) to be sprayed and having

piezoceramics (6), characterized in that an elastic
material (20) having gas bubbles seals an intermediate

space (22) between the housing part (8) and the side of
the piezoceramics (6) radiating into the liquid (10)

against the liquid (10) to be sprayed.
Ultrasonic sprayer according to claim 1,
characterized in that in addition to the elastic

material (20) having gas bubbles a solid plastics
material (14) seals against the liquid (10) to be

sprayed.
Ultrasonic sprayer according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the housing part (8) has a floor

with a central opening (18), under which the
piezoceramics (6) are arranged.
Ultrasonic sprayer according to claim 3,
characterized in that the piezoceramics (6) abut the

floor by means of an O-ring (14) abutting their edge
region (12), and in that the elastic material (20)

having gas bubbles lies in the edge region of the
opening (18).
Ultrasonic sprayer according to one of claims
1 to 4, characterized in that the elastic material (20)

having gas bubbles is silicon foam.
