<ABSTRACT>
Novel fluorinated aromatic polyimide, polyamide and 
polyamide-imide gas separation membranes and the process of 

using such membranes to separate one or more gases from a 
gaseous mixture is disclosed. The polyimides, polyamides 

and polyamide-imides are formed from diamines of the formula 

where Ar' is any aromatic diol moiety and X is independently 
fluorinated alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, most 

preferably a trifluoromethyl group, m is an integer from 1 
to 4, preferably 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluorinated aromatic polyimide, 
polyamide and polyamide-imide gas separation membranes and the process 
for separating one or more gases from a gaseous mixture using such 
membranes. The polyimides, polyamides and polyamide-imides are derived 
from diamines which incorporate fluorinated aromatic diamines in the 
polymer chain. The inventive gas separation membranes exhibit 
exceptionally good permeation rates with good selectivity. U.S. Patent No. 5,089,593 discloses polyimides containing the 
4,4'-bis(4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl phenoxy) biphenyl moiety. Japanese Laid-open Patent Application (Kokai) No. 1-261422 
discloses a fluorinated aromatic polyimide which contains the following units: 
In this formula, Rf is a low perfluoroalkyl group, R₂ is a tetravalent organo 
group, and -N is situated in the meta or para position with respect to the 
aromatic ether bond -O-. "Effect of Structural Features and Humidity on the Dielectric 
Constant of Polyimides" by Frank W. Mercer and Timothy Goodman, High 
Performance Polymers, Vol. 3, No. 4, 1991 discloses a variety of fluorinated 
polymers including the following:  However, the prior art does not disclose gas separation 
membranes made from such fluorinated aromatic polymers. The present invention relates to certain fluorinated aromatic 
polyimide, polyamide and polyamide-imide separation membranes 
particularly useful for separating gases and the process for using them. This 
class of membrane materials compositionally contain diamines which 
incorporate fluorinated aromatic units in the polymer chain, particularly 
aromatic diamines containing pendant trifluoromethyl groups on the 
aromatic chains. Membranes formed from this class of polyimide materials 
exhibit superior gas permeability and good selectivity. It is believed that the 
high permeabilities of some gases from multicomponent mixtures is due to 
the molecular free volume in the polymer which is created by the substituents 
on the diamines. These polymers also exhibit improved solubility which 
facilitates their production of ion exchange membranes. The present invention relates to the discovery that gas separation 
membranes exhibiting exceptional gas permeability can be obtained by 
forming gas separation membranes from fluorinated aromatic polyimides, 
polyamides and polyamide-imides which incorporate a substituted diamine 
having the structural formula H₂N-Ar-NH₂ where -Ar- is  where -Ar'- is any aromatic diol moiety, including 
or 
where -Q- is nothing or R'.
