<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming method
such as electrophotography, electrostatic recording or
magnetic recording.Methods as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
2,297,691, Japanese Patent Publications No. 42-23910
and No. 43-24748 and so forth are conventionally known
as electrophotography. In general, copies are
obtained by forming an electrostatic latent image on a
photosensitive member, utilizing a photoconductive
material and according to various means, subsequently
developing the latent image by the use of a toner, and
transferring the toner image to a transfer medium such
as paper if necessary, followed by fixing by the
action of heat, pressure, heat-and-pressure, or
solvent vapor. In the case when the process comprises 
a toner-image transfer step, the process is usually
provided with the step of removing the toner remaining
on a photosensitive member.As developing processes in which an
electrostatic latent image is formed into a visible
image by the use of a toner, known methods include the
magnetic brush development as disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 2,874,063, the cascade development as disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 2,618,552, the powder cloud
development as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,221,776,
and the method in which a conductive magnetic toner is
used, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,909,258.As toners used in these development processes,
fine powder obtained by dispersing a dye and/or
pigment in a natural or synthetic resin has been
hitherto used. For example, particles formed by
finely grinding a binder resin such as polystyrene
comprising a colorant dispersed therein, to have a
size of about 1 to 30 µ are used as the toner. A
toner incorporated with magnetic material particles
such as magnetite is also used as the magnetic toner.
On the other hand, in a system in which a two-component
type developer is used, the toner is used as
a mixture with carrier particles such as glass beads,
ion powder and ferrite particles.Nowadays, such recording processes have been 
widely utilized not only in commonly available copying
machines, but also in printers for output information
from a computer, or for the printing of microfilms (or
copying from microfilms). Accordingly, a higher
performance has become required, and the above
recording processes have now been required to
simultaneously achieve the improvements in performance
such that an apparatus is made small-sized,
lightweight, low-energy, high-speed, maintenance-free,
and personal. In order to meet these requirements,
the needs on toners
