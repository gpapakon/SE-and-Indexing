<ABSTRACT>
In a small radio controlled watch (12) of compact design, which has a magnetic antenna (aerial) (11) integrated into the movement section, the main printed circuit board (26) for interconnecting the essential components of the autonomous clock circuit, the receiver (42) and the processor (41) for the internal function coordination including a voltage transformer which is possibly present for driving an LCD is countersunk so deep into a hole (28) in the central region of the disc-shaped antenna coiled core (13) that the plane of the conductor tracks (38) on the one side of the printed circuit board (26) is as far as possible aligned with the central plane (37) of the core (13) and with the axis (18) of the antenna coil (14) supported on an eccentric bulge of the core (13). Moreover, active components, in particular when they operate by means of clocked currents, such as, in particular, the processor (41) and the receiver (42), are arranged on this main printed circuit board (26) at as great a distance as possible from the coil (14) and distributed as far as possible opposite one another on both sides of the printed circuit board (26), with the result that the centre of the interfering alternating fields emanating from the pulsed currents once again is also situated in this regard in the central plane (37) of the core (13). These positionings produce a far reaching vectorial compensation of magnetic alternating field components which penetrate the cross-section of the coil (14) and result from the circuit currents, with the result that the received signal with the time information to be decoded is not covered by locally produced disturbance fields (interference fields, noise fields). It is possible to arrange away from the central plane (37) an additional printed circuit board or circuit components which operate only sporadically - during the pauses in the receiving operation -, such as, for example, an evaluation circuit for externally actuable momentary-contact switches and, in particular, the driver circuit for a stepping motor (stepper motor, pulse motor) for driving the gearing. The latter plunges into a hat-shaped holder which is made from insulating material, projects coaxially into the hole (28) in the core (13), and supports the main printed circuit board (26) below its base (36).
