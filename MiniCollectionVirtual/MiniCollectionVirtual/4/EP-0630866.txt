<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is provided for applying a tensile force along the longitudinal axis 
of a cane assembly during the deposition of soot thereon to produce an optical fiber 

preform. Fiber drawn from such a preform exhibits improved core/clad concentricity. 
The tensile force may be applied at one or both ends of the cane assembly, with 

application at both ends being preferred. The tensile force may be varied during the 
deposition of soot. The cane assembly may be annealed prior to beginning the 

deposition of soot thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for making an optical fiber preform,
which can be drawn into a fiber with an improved core/clad concentricity.In the manufacture of an optical fiber, a preform is typically made using either
outside vapor deposition (OVD), vapor axial deposition (VAD) or modified chemical
vapor deposition (MCVD) techniques. OVD and VAD preforms are then dehydrated
and consolidated to form a solid glass blank while MCVD preforms are collapsed to
form a solid glass blank. The glass blanks are then drawn into fiber. Alternatively,
the glass blanks can be drawn into core cane which is then overclad using OVD or
rod-in-tube techniques to form an overclad preform. The overclad preform is
subsequently dehydrated and consolidated to form an overclad glass blank which is
then drawn into fiber.One parameter of interest in the drawn fiber is the core/clad concentricity
(hereinafter referred to as concentricity). Concentricity is a measure of how well the
core of a fiber is centered with respect to the overall center of the fiber. FIG. 7
shows a cross-section of an optical fiber 70 with core region 71 having center A and
clad region 72 having center B. The concentricity can then be characterized by the
distance X between core center A and clad center B.It is believed that for an overclad preform, the concentricity is determined
during the overclad deposition step. For instance, in a cane assembly a rod may be
attached to an upper cane handle and a lower cane handle, and FIG. 1 of the
accompanying drawings shows a cane assembly 1 with a rod 2 attached to upper and
lower cane handles 3 and 4. If the cane assembly is not made perfectly straight, it
will wobble when rotated during the soot deposition process, resulting in uneven
deposition of soot around the cane due to the relative movement of the cane assembly
with respect to the soot stream. Even if a cane assembly could be made perfectly
straight, wobble is likely to develop because of changes in stresses in the cane
assembly which result from heating the cane assembly during the soot deposition
process, particularly as both length and diameter of an optical fiber preform have 
been increased in recent years. It becomes necessary to adjust the chucks holding the
cane assembly, which is tedious and time consuming, and has to be done repeatedly,
as heating of the cane assembly during the soot deposition process will change the
stress pattern within the case and will again produce a wobble. U.S. Patents
