<ABSTRACT>
A rotor assembly for a synchronous 
reluctance dynamo/motor machine has a plurality of 

axial laminations (25,26) formed of alternate magnetic 
and non-magnetic materials. The rotor (15,see Fig.4) comprising the 

arms (181-180) with wholes for the threaded fasteners (53) 
and the supporting shaft (13) has an end 

cap (14,see Fig.1) on each axial end which engages stepped axial 
ends (33-35) of the laminations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotor 
assembly for use, for example, with synchronous speed 
dynamo/motor machines. A synchronous reluctance motor is a 
synchronous machine which has a stator with poly-phase 
windings forming a plurality of poles similar to 
induction motors. The reluctance motor also includes 
a rotor which does not use windings or permanent 
magnets but which has the same number of poles as the 
stator. The rotor is manufactured as an anisotropic 
structure, with each pair of poles of the motor having 
a direction of minimum reluctance, the direct axis, 
and a direction of maximum reluctance, the quadrature 
axis. A synchronous reluctance motor is similar to 
other synchronous motors with the distinct difference 
of having no DC excitation. That is, the motor does 
not have brushes and slip rings. The stator windings 
of the synchronous reluctance motor are substantially 
identical to those employed in poly-phase induction 
motors with the added advantage of operating 
efficiently with concentric windings which are similar 
to the salient pole windings used in DC motors. The 
rotors of the synchronous reluctance motor are 
constructed to have different values of reluctance 
between the direct and quadrature axes. This provides 
an easy flux path for the direct axis in comparison to 
the quadrature axis. The magnetic performance index 
ratio (direct axis to quadrature axis reluctance) 
affects the performance of the synchronous reluctance 
motor. The higher the ratio, the better the 
performance of the synchronous reluctance motor. 
Conventional reluctance motors exhibit a performance 
index ratio of approximately five.  By providing a rotating field in the stator 
windings, a magnetomotive force is created in the 
rotor which results in an attempt to align with the 
magnetomotive force generated in the stator. The 
rotor tends to displace the direct axis of minimum 
reluctance until the alignment of the fields is 
attained resulting in the rotor being driven at a 
synchronous speed proportional to the rotating field 
in the stator. In order that maximum power can be 
derived from the motor, it is desirable to maximise 
the ratio of the direct-to-quadrature axis reactance. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved rotor assembly for an asynchronous reluctance 
machine. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a rotor assembly as 
specified in claim 1. A preferred embodiment utilises magnetic 
laminations interleaved alternately with non-magnetic
