<ABSTRACT>
An image-quality stabilizer provided in a copying 
machine executes a feedback control on a charger (2) output 

based on an adhering toner amount detected by a patch 
sensor (9) in a pre-rotation of the photoreceptor drum 

directly before each copying operation is started. A 
time interval between feedback controls is counted by a 

timer (15), and CPU (14) sets a time interval in accordance with 
an amount of change in adhering toner amount obtained 

based on the detected adhering toner amount is set in 
the timer (15). According to the described arrangement, 

since the feedback control is executed at a timing set 
in accordance with the amount of change in adhering 

toner, variations in image quality such as an increase 
in image density caused by overcompensation and an 

excessive feedback control can be prevented, thereby 
ensuring stable image quality by efficiently 

compensating the image density without increasing an 
amount of toner consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image-quality
stabilizer for use in an electrophotographic printing
machine such as an analog copying machine, a digital
copying machine, a laser beam printer, etc., for
controlling image forming devices so as to maintain the
density of toner adhering to the circumference of a
photoreceptor in a desirable range.In an electrophotographic printing machine such as
a copying machine, a laser printer, etc., image forming
processes are generally carried out in the following
manner. By exposing an image formed on a document, 
toner is made to adhere to an electrostatic latent
image formed on a photoreceptor, and after transferring
the toner to a transfer sheet, the toner is melted with
the application of heat so as to be permanently affixed
thereto, thereby forming an image (copying). In such
an electrophotographic printing machine, as the
above-mentioned image forming process is repeated, the
respective properties of the image forming devices
including expendables such as a photoreceptor, a
developer material, etc., and of a charger deteriorate,
and for this reason, a surface potential of the
photoreceptor and an amount of toner adhering thereto
change which cause variations in copy density and copy
brightness, thereby presenting the problem of unstable
image quality.In order to prevent the above problem, the
conventional electrophotographic printing machine is
provided with an image-quality stabilizer for detecting
an amount of toner adhering to the surface of the
photoreceptor or a surface potential which affects the
amount of adhering toner. This, in turn, executes a
feedback control on the image forming devices including
a charger, a developer unit, a discharge lamp, and an
exposure optical system so as to obtain a constant
detected value. More specifically, the image-quality 
stabilizer executes feedback-controls on the image
forming devices so as to stabilize the image quality.
Therefore, an image forming device obtained at a
reasonable price can be used and an expensive image
forming device whose property can be ensured against
the repetitive use is not needed. Moreover, an
exchange cycle of the expendables such as the
developer, etc., can be made longer. Therefore, the
described arrangement offers an electrophotographic
printing machine which ensures stable image quality at
a reasonable price and a low running cost. The
feedback control is executed for example, when the
electrophotographic printing machine is installed or
when the main switch of the machine is
