<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to high strength solder 
alloy which can be used for soldering in a process of 
manufacturing a machine, a device, and so on which is 
used under severe conditions. Sn - Pb alloy has been used for soldering of conductive 
parts in a process of manufacturing electronic parts and 
devices, but such Sn - Pb alloy is unsatisfactory for 
soldering of parts and devices which are used 
particularly under severe conditions. For example, some 
automobile parts are possibly used between a high 
temperature such as 150 °C and a low temperature such 
as minus 50 °C. Therefore the development of new solder 
alloy which can be used under such a severe condition 
has been required. In case conventional Sn - Pb solder alloy is used under 
such a severe condition, the internal stress caused by the 
difference between the coefficient of thermal expansion 
of the solder alloy and that of the material of the 
parts joined by soldering is generated and extinguished 
alternately and repeatedly resulting in the occurrence 
of fatigue phenomenon which finally causes a crack. In  
 
order to prevent the generation of such a crack, it is 
necessary to raise the strength of solder alloy. It is 
particularly noteworthy that the mechanical property of 
solder alloy is lowered remarkably between 100°C and 150°C 
in utility temperature. As described above, solder alloy having such high 
mechanical strength that can withstand severe utility 
conditions is required as solder alloy which is to be 
used in the future. Accordingly, high tensile strength 
is naturally required as a mechanical property of 
solder alloy, but high toughness is also required as an 
important property of solder alloy at the same time. Furthermore low melting point is also required for 
solder alloy. It is generally thought that a 
precondition of basic metal for solder alloy of low 
melting point is Sn - Pb eutectic alloy (183°C in 
eutectic temperature), because even if new solder alloy 
is invented as a result of investigation, when the 
soldering work by using the new solder alloy is 
remarkably different from that by using conventional 
solder alloy, there arises a new problem in practical 
use. Thus the purpose of the present invention is to propose 
high strength solder alloy having high mechanical strength 
and high toughness which can withstand severe conditions. The high strength solder alloy according to the present 
invention is characterized in that it comprises Ag and Ge 
of 0.8 to 7.0 or less weight% in total (each of
