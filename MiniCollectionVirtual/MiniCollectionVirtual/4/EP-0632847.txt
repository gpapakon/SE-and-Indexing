<CLAIMS>
A process for coating a substrate (10) with a metal giving a polished effect, the
substrate (10) being of a suitable material that is dimensionally stable up to at

least 120°C, said process comprising the process steps as described below following
each other directly:


a') Applying and burning in a powder lacquer coating directly on the substrate
as a base coating (12);
b') Coating the coated substrate (10) with the metal that gives the polished
effect within a vacuum chamber, with which a plasma process takes place;
c') Application of a powder lacquer coating as a top coating (16) and burning
this in.
A process as defined in Claim 1,
characterized in that

the base coating (12) is burned in the form of a powder lacquer coating at a substrate
temperature of approximately 120°C to 240°C.
A process as defined in Claim 2,
characterized in that

the powder lacquer coating is burned in for a period of 8 minutes to 30 minutes. 
A process as defined in one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that

the substrate (10) that is provided with the base coating (12) is arranged within a
reaction chamber (24) in which initially there is a pressure of at least 10
-4
 millibars;

in that
 the reaction chamber is then flooded with process gas to produce a
pressure P
P
 of approximately 1 to 10
-3
 millibars; and 
in that
 the plasma process
takes place at the pressure P
P
.
A process as defined in Claim 1,
characterized in that

the top coating (16) is burned in at a substrate temperature of approximately
120°C to 240°C.
A process as defined in Claim 5,
characterized in that

the top coating (16) is burned in for a period of approximately 8 minutes to 30
minutes.
A process as defined in one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that

the powder that is required for the powder lacquer coating is applied electrostatically
or by sintering.
A process as defined in one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that

in each instance the thickness of the base coating (12) and/or top coating (16) is
approximately 25 µm to 125 µm.
A process as defined in one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that

the coatings (12, 14, 16) that are applied to the substrate (10) have a total thickness
of approximately 50 µm to 250 µm. 
A process as defined in one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that

high frequency, direct current, single or double cathode vaporization, arc vaporization,
or lasers are used to generate or induce the plasma.
A process as defined in Claim 4,
characterized in that

in the reaction chamber (24) there initially is a pressure of between 10
-4
 and 10
-5

millibars.
A process as defined in Claim 7,
characterized in that

the powder is applied using the vortex sintering process.
