<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to tricyclic derivatives, or
pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, which possess anti-cancer
activity and are accordingly useful in methods of treatment of cancer
in the human or animal body. The invention also relates to processes
for the manufacture of said tricyclic derivatives, to pharmaceutical
compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of
medicaments of use in the production of an anti-cancer effect in a
warm-blooded animal such as man.Many of the current treatment regimes for cancer utilise
compounds which inhibit DNA synthesis. Such compounds are toxic to
cells generally but their toxic effect on the rapidly dividing tumour
cells can be beneficial. Alternative approaches to anti-cancer agents
which act by mechanisms other than the inhibition of DNA synthesis
have the potential to display enhanced selectivity of action against
cancer cells.In recent years it has been discovered that a cell may
become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its
DNA into an oncogene i.e. a gene which, on activation, leads to the
formation of malignant tumour cells (Bradshaw, Mutagenesis, 1986, 1,
91). Several such oncogenes give rise to the production of peptides
which are receptors for growth factors. The growth factor receptor
complex subsequently leads to an increase in cell proliferation. It
is known, for example, that several oncogenes encode tyrosine kinase
enzymes and that certain growth factor receptors are also tyrosine
kinase enzymes (Yarden etal., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 1988, 57, 443;
Larsen etal. Ann. Reports in Med. Chem. 1989, Chpt. 13).Receptor tyrosine kinases are important in the transmission
of biochemical signals which initiate cell replication. They are
large enzymes which span the cell membrane and possess an
extracellular binding domain for growth factors such as epidermal
growth factor and an intracellular portion which functions as a kinase
to phosphorylate tyrosine amino acids in proteins and hence to
influence cell proliferation. It is known that such kinases are
frequently present in common human cancers such as breast cancer 
(Sainsbury et al., Brit. J. Cancer, 1988, 58, 458; Guerin etal.,
Oncogene Res., 1988, 3, 21), gastrointestinal cancer such as colon,
rectal or stomach cancer (Bolen et al., Oncogene Res., 1987, 1, 149),
leukaemia (Konaka et al., Cell, 1984, 37, 1035) and ovarian, bronchial
or pancreatic cancer (European Patent Specification No. 0400586). As
further human tumour tissues are tested for receptor tyrosine
