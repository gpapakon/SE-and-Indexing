<ABSTRACT>
In order to simplify the design of an automatic gas firing unit of heating installations which are intended to have a high efficiency and operate with a low degree of pollution even in part-load ranges, the adjusting member for the air is a fan of variable speed which can be driven by a DC motor which can be controlled by, in particular, digital pulse-width-modulated control signals of a control unit to which the regulator is applied. The gas valve is re-adjusted as a function of the air pressure in the line leading from the fan to the burner.
