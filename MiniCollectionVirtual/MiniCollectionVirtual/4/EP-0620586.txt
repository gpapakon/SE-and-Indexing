<ABSTRACT>
An thin film resistor on a semiconductor device may 
be laser-trimmed with reducing the influence of the thickness 

of a passivation film formed on the thin film resistor. On 
an Si substrate is formed an underlying oxide film consisting 

of BPSG film and silicon oxide film, thereon is formed thin 
film resistor, thereon are formed silicon oxide film and 

silicon nitride film as a passivation film for thin film 
resistor, then silicon oxide film is further formed. The 

silicon oxide film contributes to controlling a variation, 
due to an uneven thickness of silicon nitride film, of 

absorption rate of the energy of the laser beams at a thin 
film resistor, thereby enabling a stabilized adjustment of 

the resistance value of the thin film resistor by means of 
laser beams.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device according to the preamble of claim 1 having a thin film resistor whose resistance value is
adjusted by means of a laser trimming.Hitherto, an integration of a thin film resistor on
a semiconductor substrate has made it possible for a
semiconductor device to be made smaller and less costly. For
adjustment of the resistance value of the thin film resistor,
a laser trimming method is generally used which adjusts a
resistance value by fusing the thin film resistor with laser
beams irradiated on it. Also, a two-layered passivation film
is used for the protection of the thin film resistor, as
proposed, for instance, in USP 4,217,570. As shown in FIG.
1, on which the preamble of claim 1 is based a silicon oxide film 3 is formed on the thin film resistor
4 for the trimming capability, and a silicon nitride film 2
is formed on the silicon oxide film 3 for the environmental
resistance. FIG. 1 also shows a silicon substrate 6, an
underlying oxide film 5 such as silicon oxide film, and an
aluminum electrode 7.An important thing for the laser trimming process is
to adjust the quantity of laser energy absorbed by the thin
film resistor to an optimum level. If the absorbed energy is 
too little, the thin film resistor will fuse insufficiently,
and if it is excessive, the insulating films or semiconductor
substrate will be damaged.In FIG. 1, the laser beams transmitted through thin
film resistor 4 are partly reflected by the surface of
underlying oxide film 5 and by the surface of silicon
substrate 6 respectively, and are absorbed again, while
interfering with the transmitted lights, by thin film
resistor 4. There also occur reflections and interference on
the surface of thin film resistor 4 and the surfaces of
surface passivation film 2 and 3. The total quantity of the
laser beams absorbed by the thin film resistor 4 varies
depending on the thickness of each film composing a
semiconductor device. Therefore, an optimum adjustment of
the thickness of each film is required to perform a laser
trimming in a stabilized manner.However, due to such factors as nonuniformity in a
production process, film thicknesses can vary for each wafer
or for each lot. In EP -A- 0 443 575, by holding down the
nonuniformity in film thickness by reducing the film
thickness of the underlying oxide film at bottom of the thin
film resistor and having a film thickness in which it is
possible to obtain the largest absorption rate of the laser
energy to the thin film resistor, the influence
