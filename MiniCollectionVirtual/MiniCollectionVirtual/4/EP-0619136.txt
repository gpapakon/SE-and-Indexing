<ABSTRACT>
Provided is agitator blade which is characterized in 
that one or more liquid transporting means (12) are arranged on a 

mounting frame secured to an agitator shaft (2) and the both ends 
of each of said liquid transporting means are opened to have 

an upper opening and a lower opening (125,124), respectively. The 
liquid transporting means include tube bodies, gutter bodies 

and plate bodies. An agitating method using said agitator 
blade is also provided. This invention makes it possible to 

defoam surely and effectively and also effectively mix liquids 
having different specific gravities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method
for extinguishing foam from
foamable liquids,In fermentation or culturing processes, the
fermenting liquids and culturing liquids are very prone to
foam. Agitation foam causes foam during the process, and the
foam often impairs operability of the process. In order to
inhibit such foaming and to extinguish such foam, addition of
anti-foaming agents such as silicone is generally adopted.
The use of such anti-foaming agents, however, not only
requires significant cost, but also poses a risk adversely
affecting the fermentation and culturing processes, because
these anti-foaming agents are, in themselves, foreign
substances to the liquids. In addition, the anti-foaming
agents are often included as impurities in the product until
the product is degraded. It requires additional labor to
remove them from the product. Furthermore, they contaminate
waste liquid and impede a treatment of waste liquid.
Accordingly, addition of anti-foaming agents is not desirable
and should be controlled as little as possible.Moreover, attempts have been made to carry out
defoaming by a mechanical means which is to suppress the foam
by shearing force by rotating a disk in a foam layer on the
surface of the liquid or rotating a frusto-conical tube with
allowing the lower opening of the larger diameter to be in the
foam layer. However, such means requires a great power and 
besides, the foam is often merely subdivided and is not
extinguished. The inventors achieved the present invention as expressed
in claim 1 after conducting elaborate research regarding
conventional defoaming by agitation.
The method of
the invention can efficiently and thoroughly extinguish foam
and can clean the inner wall surface of agitation tank and the
surface of heating and cooling apparatuses and can inhibit the
reduction of heat transfer area of the inner wall surface of
agitation tank and heating and cooling apparatuses.

<CLAIMS>
A method for defoaming a liquid in a tank, said method comprising

providing an agitator blade (1) including a mounting frame (11) mounted on an
agitator shaft (2), said agitator blade (1) having one or more liquid-transporting

means (12; 8; 9; 91, 92; 201; 202) each of which has an upper liquid-discharging
end (124, 81; 205) and a lower liquid-intake end (125; 82; 204), said

upper liquid-discharging end (124; 81; 205) being positioned above a level of 
possible foam on a foamable liquid contained in the tank and said lower

liquid-intake end (125, 82; 204) being positioned in said liquid;
rotating the agitator shaft (2) in a manner that the liquid not yet being foamed
is suctioned from said lower liquid-intake end (125, 82; 204) and discharged from

said upper liquid-discharging end (124, 81; 205); and
distributing said discharged liquid onto the foam in a manner that defoaming
is effected.
The method according to claim 1, wherein said liquid-transporting
means are tube bodies (12).
The method according to claim 1, wherein said liquid-transporting
means are gutter bodies (8).
The method according to claim 1, wherein said liquid-transporting
means are plate bodies (9; 91, 92).
The method according to claim 1, wherein said liquid-transporting
means are bottomless and hollow truncated cone bodies (201; 202) which are allowed to

substantially coincide with the longer axis of the agitator shaft (2).
The method according to any of claims 2 to 5, wherein said liquid-transporting
means (12; 8; 91, 92) are arranged inclined on the mounting frame (11).
The method according to any of the claims 1 to 6, wherein said mounting frame
(11) is fixed to the agitator shaft (2).
The method according to any of the claims 1 to 6, wherein said mounting frame
(11) is slidably fitted to the agitator shaft (2).
