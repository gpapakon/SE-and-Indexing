Process for producing argon, in which air is
fractionated in a rectifying system having at least one

air fractionation column (1) and a crude argon column,
an argon-containing oxygen fraction (4) being withdrawn

from the air fractionation column (1) and introduced
into a crude argon column (5), a crude argon fraction

(6) being withdrawn and a first reflux liquid (7) being
applied in the upper area of the crude argon column

(5), and a first residue fraction (8) being withdrawn
in the lower area of the crude argon column (5),

characterized in that the crude argon fraction (6) is
introduced into the lower area of a semipure column

(9), an oxygen-depleted argon fraction being withdrawn
(10, 15) and a second reflux liquid (11) being applied

in the upper area of the semipure column (9) and a
second residue fraction (12) being withdrawn in the

lower area of the semipure column (9), which second
residue fraction forms the first reflux liquid (7) for

the crude argon column (5).
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the pressure in the lower area of the semipure

column (9) is essentially equal to the pressure in the
upper area of the crude argon column (5).
Process according to Claim 1 or 2,
ch
aracterized in that at least a portion of the argon
fraction from the upper area of the semipure column (9)

is condensed by indirect heat exchange (13) and at 
least a portion of the condensate forms the second

reflux liquid (11).
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in
that in the indirect heat exchange (13) a liquid

fraction (14) from one of the air fractionation columns
(1; 2) is evaporated.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the air fractionation column (1) is constructed as

a double column and has a pressure column (2) and a
low-pressure column (3), the argon-containing oxygen

fraction (4) being withdrawn from the low-pressure
column (3), the liquid fraction evaporating against

condensing argon fraction being formed by oxygen-enriched
liquid (14) from the pressure column (2) and

the vaporized liquid fraction (16) being fed into the
low-pressure column (3).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the crude argon column (5)

comprises dumped packings and/or arranged packings.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the semipure column (9) comprises

dumped packings and/or arranged packings.
Apparatus for producing argon having a
rectifying system which possesses at least one air

fractionation column (1) and a crude argon column (5),
air fractionation column (1) and crude argon column (5)

being connected via a line (4) for an argon-containing
oxygen fraction, characterized by a semipure column

(9), a crude argon line (6) which leads from the upper
area of the crude argon column (5) to the lower area of

the semipure column (9), and means (7; 11) for feeding
reflux liquid into the upper areas of crude argon

column (5) and semipure column (9) and having residue
fraction lines (8; 12) which lead out of the lower

areas of crude argon column (5) and semipure column
(9), respectively, the residue fraction line (12) of

the semipure column (9) being connected to the means
(7) for feeding reflux liquid into the crude argon

column (5). 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized
in that the crude argon line (6) possesses no means for

decreasing or increasing the pressure.
Apparatus according to Claim 8 or 9,
characterized by a top condenser (13) whose

condensation side is connected to the upper area of the
semipure column (9).
Apparatus according to Claim 10, characterized
by a liquid line which leads from the air fractionation

column (1) to the evaporation side of the top condenser
(13).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 8 to 11,
characterized in that the crude argon column (5)

comprises dumped packings and/or arranged packings.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 8 to 12,
characterized in that the semipure column (9) comprises

dumped packings and/or arranged packings.
