<ABSTRACT>
An electric power steering device (1) includes an output 
shaft (4) connected to a steering mechanism of a steering 

system for power assisting the steering operation. The 
EPS (1) includes a motor (5) and a control circuit (9) accommodated 

in a common motor housing (10). The motor housing (10) comprises 
an end frame (11) and a cup-shaped motor case (12) hermetically 

covering the motor (5) and the control circuit (9). The end 
frame (11) is secured to a rack housing (13) accommodating the 

steering mechanism, so that heat generated by the motor (5) 
and the control circuit (11) is transmitted to the rack 

housing (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric
power steering device for assisting the steering
operation.Nowadays, an electric power steering device
(hereinafter abbreviated as EPS) has been put into
practical use, according to which the steering operation
is assisted by the rotational output of a motor. The EPS
is constituted by a motor for assisting the steering
power, a torque sensor for detecting the steering torque,
an electromagnetic clutch for disconnecting the motor
from the steering mechanism under abnormal condition, and
a control circuit for controlling the motor current based
upon signals detected by the torque sensor, a vehicle
speed sensor and other sensors. For example, EP-A-0535422 discloses an
electric power steering apparatus for a vehicle having a steering system
including a steering mechanism accommodated in a rack shaft case, the
electric power steering apparatus comprising: an output shaft which is
connected to the steering apparatus; a motor for torque-assisting the
steering apparatus via the output shaft; a signal processing circuit to
provide signals to a control circuit which controls the motor; and a motor
housing for accommodating the motor, said motor housing being arranged
in thermal contact with the rack housing. The EPS is mounted to a 
speed sensor and other sensors. The EPS is mounted to a
vehicle at a lower position in the engine room, and is
exposed to undesirable environmental conditions so that
it is submerged in the water depending upon the running
speed even though the depth of water may be small and it
is subjected to muddy water and snow adhered thereto.
Therefore, the control circuit of the EPS is usually
arranged inside the passenger compartment where the
environment is favorable.The conventional electric power steering
devices, however, involve the following problems.
(1) The control circuit has many signal lines
that are connected to the motor, the electric clutch, the
rotational angle sensor for detecting the steering angle,
and the like units. Therefore, many connectors are used
for connecting these signal lines, causing the control
circuit to become bulky. Furthermore, defective contact
of the connectors may occur with an increase in the 
number of the connectors.(2) In order to mount the control circuit in
the passenger compartment, the signal lines must pass
through a partitioning wall between the compartment and
the engine room, so an increased number of assembling
steps are required for accomplishing the connection. In
particular, the wiring for
