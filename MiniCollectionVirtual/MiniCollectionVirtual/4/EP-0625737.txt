<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention a list of fields is displayed on a 
display like a TV screen. Each field corresponds to a given time period, 

like an hour, a day, a week, or the like. Control-times which are input 
by a user via an according input device, are displayed in that field, 

time period of which includes said control-time. 
In a preferred embodiment the fields are arranged such that the first 
field of this list corresponds a given time period, e.g. of a current 

hour, a current day, like today, a day before or the like. The list can 
be designed e.g. as a calendar with a number of fields, each for one 

day. Inside each of these fields a sub-list can be generated which gives 
an overview of programmed times of the according day.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an according 
device for programming a timer which controls devices connected 
to it. Timers e.g. for switching on or off respectively devices 
connected with said timer are well known. There are also 
timers known which do not simply switch a device on or off 
but also select operation parameters which effect according 
operation modes. One example for such a programming is the 
programming of a video tape-recorder (VTR) which is switched 
on to a given time and records e.g. a television (TV) program 
of a given TV-channel. Timer programming of a device may include one or more on/off 
times and at each of these times different operation parameters 
may be selected. It is also known to realise the timer programming of one or 
more devices via a common monitor device. Such a monitor 
device may be a TV set and via this TV set this itself and a 
VTR may be programmed. It is further possible to program 
other devices which may be connected to the TV set via a 
so-called homebus-system, like audio-tuners, further TV sets, 
further VTRs, or thelike. The programming of devices where beside on/off-times several 
operation parameters can be programmed is quite complicate. It is an object of the present invention to develop a timer 
system of the type mentioned such that programming is simplified 
for a user. This can be realised by a method according to claim 1 and a 
device according to the first device claim.  Advantageous developments are given by the subclaims. According to the present invention a list of fields is displayed 
on a display like a TV screen. Each field corresponds 
to a given time period, like an hour, a day, a week, or 
thelike. Control-times which are input by a user via an according 
input device, are displayed in that field, time period 
of which includes said control-time. In a preferred embodiment the fields are arranged such that 
the first field of this list corresponds a given time period, 
e.g. of a current hour, a current day, like today, a day 
before or thelike. The list can be designed e.g. as a calendar 
with a number of fields, each for one day. Inside each of 
these fields a sub-list can be generated which gives an over-view 
of programmed times of the according day. In a development the calendar-fields are expanded when a time 
is programmed at the day belonging to an according calendar-field. Further characteristics, advantages and details of the invention 
will be explained in the following embodiments, where

Method for timer programming where one or more devices 
can be controlled in dependence on given control-times, 

corresponding signals are to be input, characterised in 
that a list is created including a number of fields 

(106), each of these fields (106) corresponds to a given 
time period, and that the input control-times are displayed 

inside that field to which time period they belong. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
first field (106.1) is that field to which the current 

time belongs. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the fields (106) are arranged as calendar. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the arrangement of the f
ields (106) is 
changed when control-times are input, which be long to 

the last displayed field (106.21) 
Device for timer programming with 

control means (100) which can control one or more 
devices (105) in dependence on given control-times, 
input means (102, 104) for the input of signals 
corresponding to given control-times, and 
monitor means (103) for displaying the control-times, 
 
characterised in that 
the control means (100) generate a list which includes 
a number of fields (106), each of these 

fields (106) corresponds to a given time period, 
said list is displayed with the aid of the monitor 
means (103) and 
the input control times are displayed inside that 
field (106) to which time period they belong. 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
control means (100) generate the list such that its 

first field (106.1) is that field to which the current 
time belongs. 
Device according to one of the claims 5 or 6, characterised 
in that the fields (106) are arranged as calendar. 
Device according to one of the claims 5 to 7, characterised 
in that the control means (100) change the arrangement 

of the fields (106) when control-times are input, 
which belong to the last displayed field (106.21)
