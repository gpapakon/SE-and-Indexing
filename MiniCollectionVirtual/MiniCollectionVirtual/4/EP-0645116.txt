<ABSTRACT>
A filter (10) for rezeroing an in-vivo pressure sensor (2) is 
disclosed. The filter (10) operates in a signal mode and a rezero 

mode. In the signal mode, the filter (10) is a low pass filter 
which filters out noise. In the rezero mode, the filter (10) is a 

low pass filter which filters out the dynamic components of an 
in-vivo pressure signal caused by the rezeroing of the pressure 

sensor (2). The filter (10) is switchable between the signal and 
rezero modes. The filter (10) is implemented by means of an active 

two pole RC filter (14) with a Butterworth response. A circuit 
(16) is provided to shorten the time in which the filter (14) 

reaches its final response characteristic. Also disclosed is a 
method for processing an output from an in vivo pressure 

transducer (2), the output signal comprising noise, a mean 
pressure signal and a dynamic pressure signal. The method 

comprises the steps of: receiving as an input, the output signal 
from the pressure transducer (2); filtering out the noise from the 

received input by means of a first filter circuit (14a); and, 
filtering out the dynamic pressure signal while passing the mean 

pressure signal by connecting a second circuit (14b) to the first 
filter circuit (14a).

<DESCRIPTION>
In the course of medical treatment, if is often desirable to measure the blood 
pressure of a patient. In the past this has been done by means of external pressure 
transducers. More recently, blood pressure has been measured by the placement of 
a pressure transducer directly inside a blood vessel of the patient or inside a catheter 
which is placed inside the patient's blood vessel. The placement of the transducer 
inside a blood vessel enables the observation of blood pressure waveforms having 
high dynamic fidelity. All known blood pressure transducers experience some drift in their in their 
outputs at zero pressure. They must therefore be rezeroed to atmospheric pressure 
periodically. Rezeroing is typically accomplished by a control on the monitor to 
which the transducer is connected which adjusts the measured output signal to 
correct for the offset observed at zero (atmospheric) pressure. Rezeroing a transducer placed inside the blood vessel presents unique 
difficulties, since the temporary removal of the transducer from the blood vessel to 
vent the tip of the atmosphere is a difficult procedure which presents risks to the 
patient when conventional rezeroing methods are used. An in-vivo pressure transducer typically comprises a Wheatstone bridge 
mounted at least partially on a diaphragm. Rezeroing involves the equalization of 
the pressure on the bottom side of the diaphragm with that on the top side of the 
diaphragm. A method and apparatus for rezeroing a pressure transducer in-vivo are 
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,203,340, which is incorporated by reference. Using  
 
the method and apparatus described and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 5,203,340, the 
transducer can be rezeroed without removing the transducer from the blood vessel. The in-vivo rezeroing of a pressure transducer has a peculiar limitation. The 
blood pressure typically seen by a pressure transducer in-vivo is dynamic and 
pulsatile. It takes a certain length of time for a pressure pulse wave to travel from 
the tip of the catheter, in which the transducer resides and at which the pressure 
wave impinges upon one side of the pressure transducer diaphragm, along the lumen 
of the catheter, through the rezeroing device and back to the other side of the 
pressure transducer diaphragm to accomplish the rezeroing. Thus, while the mean 
pressure on the diaphragm may be zero, a pulse artifact remains causing fluctuations 
of pressure about the mean. Typical pressure monitors are adapted to detect pressure based on hydraulic 
coupl
