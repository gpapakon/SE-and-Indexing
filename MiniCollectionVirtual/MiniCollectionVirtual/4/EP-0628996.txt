<ABSTRACT>
Both breakdown strength and integration degree of the device are enhanced. The PN junction of the buried 
collector region (3) and the region (4) for increasing the collector breakdown strength is reversely biased. The 

depletion layer reaches the side isolation region (9a) for isolating the collector breakdown strength increasing region 
(4) at their sides. The surrounding semiconductor region (14) adjacent to the region (4) through the isolation region 

(9a) has a potential which is more approximate to the base area (5) than to the buried collector region (3). As a result, 
the depletion layer is affected by the low potentials from both sides of the base region (5) and the circumferential 

semiconductor region (14). The field concentration at and near the corner sections between the side and bottom of 
the base region (5) are relaxed. Avalanche breakdown at these sections is suppressed, and the breakdown strength is 

thus enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
semiconductor device. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a high withstand voltage type
semiconductor device which is dielectrically isolated at
least at the sides thereof.In a semiconductor device to be loaded on a
vehicle, such as a microcomputer for controlling the vehicle
engine used in a high noise environment, the first priority
should be given to the withstand voltage despite some
disadvantages therefore, such as the slight degradation of
the integration degree or an increase in the number of
manufacturing processes. This purpose is most suitably
served by a transistor integrated circuit of side dielectric
isolation structure or total (side and bottom) dielectric
isolation structure (as disclosed in the Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication No. 48-100081).An example of high withstand voltage type NPN
bipolar transistors of total dielectric isolation structure
is illustrated in FIG. 27. In this figure, reference number
3 denotes a buried collector region; 101, a low concentration
collector withstand voltage region; 102, a high concentration 
base region; 103, an emitter region; 100, a bottom dielectric
isolation oxide film; and 104, a side dielectric isolation
oxide film.In this bipolar transistor, as a high voltage is
applied to between the base region 102 and the buried
collector region 3, a base/collector junction J is subjected
to a strong reverse bias, and a depletion layer DL (not
illustrated) thereof greatly extends into the collector
withstand voltage region 101 engulfing the base region 102.In the high withstand voltage semiconductor device
of the above structure, it is so designed that depletion
layer DL in the base/collector junction J can not reach the
buried collector region 3. Similarly, it is also designed
that the base region 102 is sufficiently separated from the
side dielectric isolation oxide film 104 so as not to allow the
depletion layer DL to reach the side isolation oxide film
104.The depletion layer DL in the base/collector
junction J is designed as to be separated from the buried
collector region 3. One of the reasons for this arrangement
in design is that the contact of the depletion layer DL in
the base/collector junction J (corresponding to the
gate/drain junction of power MOSFET) with the buried
collector region 3 (corresponding to the drain area of power
MOSFET) would have an effect on the collector current due to
a change in the collector voltage when the transistor is
switched ON. Another reason for the
