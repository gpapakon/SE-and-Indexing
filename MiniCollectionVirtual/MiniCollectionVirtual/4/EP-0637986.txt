<ABSTRACT>
Parenteral emulsion-containing medicament fluid is treated by passing the fluid into a filter assembly (10). The fluid is introduced via the inlet (15) into chamber (16) and the fluid then passes through a fluid filtration element (12) into chamber (23) and passes out of the filter device (10) via outlet (19). Passing the fluid through the filtration element (12) blocks microorganisms and other undesirable substances from passing therethrough. Gas which may be present in the fluid and/or the filter assembly (10) may be passed through gas venting elements (17, 18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and systems for
treating parenteral emulsion-containing medicament fluids
comprising an anesthetic.The use of parenteral fluids (e.g., involving an
administrative pathway other than one which involves the
gastrointestinal tract) in health care has grown rapidly
over the past several years. For example, since some
individuals are unable to receive medication by enteral
means, and some medications are less efficient when taken
enterally, the use of parenterally administered drugs is
preferred.Parenteral administration typically includes
intravascular, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes, but
drugs may be applied to the skin, injected intradermally,
inhaled or absorbed.Unfortunately, while the parenteral administration of
fluids such as medicaments may be advantageous, it is not
without drawbacks. For example, infection during the
administration process is a potential complication, even
though medicaments may be produced according to strict
regulations, e.g., strict aseptic protocols, and the
preparation may be highly uniform. Microbiologic
contamination of parenterally administered substances may
occur during their preparation, during administration, or
via manipulation of a part of the administration set, thus
leading to infection. The threat of 
infection is of particular concern when
administering parenteral fluids to debilitated
patients with compromised immune systems, since
their resistance to infection may be low.The problem may be magnified since parenterally
administered medicaments, particularly those
containing lipids, may provide a medium for the
rapid growth of potentially pathogenic
microorganisms. For example, fungal organisms, such
as Candida albicans, and bacterial organisms such as
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonasaeruginosa, and
Staphylococcusspp. may thrive in a Variety of
medicament administration systems, therefore posing
a threat of infection. Additionally, pyrogenic
substances, for example, endotoxins in the
parenteral fluid, can induce fever. Moreover,
failure to maintain aseptic protocols may lead to
infection caused by pathogenic contaminants.There are other drawbacks associated with
parenterally administered fluids, particularly those
medicaments including an oil-in-water emulsion
wherein lipids are a primary component of the
emulsion. The lipid emulsion is typically
stabilized by an emulsifying agent which gives the
emulsion droplets a negative surface charge. The
negatively charged emulsion droplets repel each
other, which helps maintain the

A method for treating a parenteral emulsion-containing
medicament fluid comprising:


passing a parenteral emulsion-containing medicament
fluid comprising an anesthetic through a microorganism-blocking

porous fluid filtration element;
blocking microorganisms; and
recovering the microorganism-depleted emulsion-containing
medicament fluid.
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of blocking
microorganisms includes removing bacteria and wherein the

step of recovering the microorganism-depleted fluid includes
recovering bacteria-depleted anesthetic fluid.
The method of claims 1 or 2 wherein the parenteral
emulsion-containing medicament fluid comprising an

anesthetic includes a lipid emulsion.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the
parenteral emulsion-containing medicament fluid comprises

propofol as the anesthetic.

0.8 micrometers.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein 
the filtration

element comprises
a membrane having a pore rating of less than

0.5 micrometers.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 6 further
comprising separating gas from a path along which the

parenteral emulsion-containing medicament fluid flows.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein passing
the parenteral emulsion-containing medicament fluid through

a fluid filtration element comprises passing the parenteral
emulsion-containing medicament fluid through a fluid

filtration element having a low affinity for amide-group
containing materials.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 8 wherein passing
the fluid through a fluid filtration element comprises

passing the fluid through a device including a housing
having an inlet and an outlet and defining a fluid

flow path between the inlet and the outlet, wherein the
fluid filtration element is arranged between the inlet and

the outlet and across the fluid flow path.
The method of claim 7, or any claim dependent thereon,
wherein separating gas from the path along which the

parenteral emulsion-containing medicament fluid flows
comprises passing the gas through at least one gas venting

element.
The method of claim 4, or any claim dependent thereon,

element having two or more layers.
The method of claim 11 wherein at least one of the
layers has a pore rating of less than

0.8 micrometers.
The method of claim 12 wherein
at least one layer has a pore rating of about

0.45 micrometers.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 13 wherein passing
the parenteral fluid through the microorganism-blocking
