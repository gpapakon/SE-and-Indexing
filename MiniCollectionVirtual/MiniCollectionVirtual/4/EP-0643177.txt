<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a urinal (10) with water flushing, in the case of which a urinal bowl (12; 46) consisting of a ceramic material is provided with a water connection opening (16; 42) and an outlet opening. The urinal bowl (12; 46) is of a smooth-walled design and exhibits an encircling, cross-sectionally U-shaped flushing-water guide duct (18) which is open towards a bowl base (20). A separate flushing-water distributor (28) is introduced into the water connection opening (16; 42) and is fastened releasably therein.

<CLAIMS>
Water flushed urinal (10) comprising 

a) a smooth walled urinal bowl (12; 46) of ceramic 
material with a water connection opening (16; 

42) and a discharge opening, 
b) a peripheral flushing water guide passage (18) 
of U-shaped cross-section which is aligned 

approximately horizontally in the region of the 
water connection opening (16; 42) for receiving 

the flushing water distributor (28) and is open 
towards a bowl base (20), whereby a free outer 

limb (22) of the U-shaped flushing water guide 
passage (18) constitutes a flushing water guide 

edge (26; 48) of the urinal bowl (12; 46); and 
c) a flushing water distributor (28) which is 
shielded towards the exterior and rendered 

invisible by the free outer limb (22) of the U-shaped 
flushing water guide passage (18) 
 
characterised in that 


d) the flushing water distributor (28) is inserted 
into the water connection opening (16; 42) and 

is releasably fastened in it and 
e) has at least one flushing pipe (54, 56) which 
can be arranged selectively in one of a 

plurality of rotational positions. 
Urinal as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that 
the water connection opening (16) is arranged 

approximately horizontally in the upper end of a 
rear wall (14) of the urinal bowl (12). 
Urinal as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in  
 

that the water connection opening (42) is arranged 
approximately perpendicularly in a top wall (44) of 

the urinal bowl (46). 
Urinal as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that 
the flushing water distributor (28) has a connecting 

piece (30) in which the at least one flushing pipe 
(54, 56) is releasably secured. 
Urinal as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that 
the connecting piece (30) has at least one insertion 

opening (58) for an insertion end (60) of the 
flushing pipe (54, 56) which has a non-round cross-section 

with which the cross-section of the 
insertion opening (58) in the connecting piece (30) 

corresponds. 
Urinal as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that 
the insertion end (60) of the flushing pipe (54, 56) 

may be axially fixed in position by means of a 
locking coupling (62) in the insertion opening (58) 

in the connecting piece (30). 
Urinal as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in that 
the locking coupling (62) comprises an elastic 

locking clip (64) which is arranged for the flushing 
pipe (54) as a unitary component of the connecting 

piece (30) coaxially with and spaced in front of the 
insertion opening (58) in the connecting piece (30). 
Urinal as claimed in one of Claims 4 to 7, 
characterised in that the connecting piece (30) is 

of T-shaped construction and has a central water 
connection socket (32) and two lateral water  

 
discharge sockets (50, 52), which are coaxially open 

in opposite directions, for the connection of a 
respective flushing pipe (54, 56). 
Urinal as claimed in Claim 8, characterised in that 
a section of the length (76, 78) at the free end of 

each of the flushing pipe (54, 56) is angled at an 
obtuse angle. 
Urinal as claimed in one of Claims 4 to 9, 
characterised in that the discharge openings (80, 

82) at the free end of the flushing pipes (54, 56) 
are bevelled towards the urinal bowl (12; 46). 
Urinal as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the central connecting socket 

(32) is provided with an internal thread (34) into 
which a threaded sleeve (36) with an external thread 

(38) is screwable from the exterior through the 
water connection opening (16; 42) in the urinal bowl 

(12; 46). 
Urinal as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that discharge slots (84, 86) for 

the flushing water are arranged both in the urinal 
bowl (12; 46) and also in the connecting piece (30).
