<ABSTRACT>
A method and library for determining the sequence of monomers in a polymer which is complementary to a receptor. The method provides for formation of pooled (6) and separate (10, 12) products. Separate products are subjected only to subsequent pooled coupling steps. Each pooled product is subsequently divided for formation of pooled and separate products. The resulting polymer library includes groups of polymer products. A first group of products (42) is used to identify the monomer at a first location in a polymer that is complementary to a receptor. A second group of products (44) is used to identify the monomer at a second location in a polymer that is complementary to a receptor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of polymer screening. More specifically, the invention provides an improved method for producing a polymer library, which library can be used to identify a polymer sequence that is complementary to a receptor.Many assays are available for measuring the binding affinity of receptors and ligands, but the information which can be gained from such experiments is often limited by the number and type of ligands which are available. Small peptides are an exemplary system for exploring the relationship between structure and function in biology. When the twenty naturally occurring amino acids are condensed into peptides they form a wide variety of three-dimensional configurations, each resulting from a particular amino acid sequence and solvent condition. The number of possible pentapeptides of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, for example, is 205 or 3.2 million different peptides. The likelihood that molecules of this size might be useful in receptor-binding studies is supported by epitope analysis studies showing that some antibodies recognize sequences as short as a few amino acids with high specificity.Prior methods of preparing large numbers of different oligomers have been painstakingly slow when used at a scale sufficient to permit effective rational or random screening. For example, the "Merrifield" method, described in Atherton etal., "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis," IRL Press, (1989), incorporated herein by reference for all purposes, has been used to synthesize peptides on a solid support such as pins or rods. The peptides are then screened to determine if they are complementary to a receptor. Using the Merrifield method, it is not economically practical to screen more than a few peptides in a day.Similar problems are encountered in the screening of other polymers having a diverse basis set of monomers. For example, various methods of oligonucleotide synthesis such as the phosphite-triester method and the phosphotrieseter method, described in Gait, "Oligonucleotide Synthesis," IRL Press, (1990), incorporated herein by reference for all purposes, have similar limitations when it is desired to synthesize many diverse oligonucleotides for screening.To screen a larger number of polymer sequences, more advanced techniques have been disclosed. For example. Pirrung etal., WO 90/15070, incorporated herein by reference for all purposes, describes a method of synthesizing a large number of polymer sequences on a solid substrate using light directed methods.
