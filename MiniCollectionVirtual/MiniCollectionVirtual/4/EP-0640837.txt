<ABSTRACT>
Using an agglutination process for the determination of an analyte from a sample solution   a) by incubation of the sample solution with agglutinable particles to which analyte-specific receptors are bound and b) photometric determination of the turbidity change in the reaction solution caused by the agglutination as a measure of the analyte content of the sample, which is characterised in that analyte is additionally added to the sample in step a), an improvement in the lower detection limit in such tests is achieved.
