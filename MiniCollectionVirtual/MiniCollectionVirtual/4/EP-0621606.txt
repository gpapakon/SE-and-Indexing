<ABSTRACT>
Sleeves (7) are pre-attached to 
the upper nozzle (1), and the guide pipes (4) are inserted into the 

respective grid cells through the sleeves (7) of the upper nozzle 
(1) and through the sleeves (8) of the grids (3). The guide pipes (4) 

are fixed in place to the sleeves (7,8) of the upper nozzle and 
of the grids (3) by bulging. There is no welding step necessary 

to join any of the assembly components while the assembly in 
semi-assembled condition. Therefore, the method is simple and 

efficient, and reduces the risk of radiation exposure to the 
assembly workers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for assembling a nuclear 
fuel assembly in general, and relates in particular to an 
efficient method for fixing an upper nozzle to control rod 
guide pipes through sleeves. In general, a nuclear fuel assembly such as the one illustrated in 
Figure 6 is known. This assembly comprises: an upper nozzle 
1; a lower nozzle 2; a plurality of grids 3 disposed between the 
nozzles 1 and 2 with predetermined spacing and each having grid 
spaces formed by intersecting straps; a plurality of guide pipes 
4; and a plurality of fuel rods 5 disposed in corresponding 
cells of each grid. The guide pipes 4 are inserted and fixed to 
the grids 3 and to the nozzles 1, 2. The fuel rods 5 inserted 
into the grid cells are held elastically by the springs formed 
in the grids 3. Conventional steps for assembling this type of assembly are 
as follows: first, a semi-assembled member 6 comprising the 
lower nozzle 2, a plurality of grids 3, the guide pipes 4 and 
the fuel rods 5 is prepared. Following this step, the 
upper nozzle 1 disposed above the semi-assembled member 6 is 
engaged with the top ends of the guide pipes 4, and the top ends 
are fixed to the upper nozzle 1 by welding to produce a fuel 
assembly.  
 In such a conventional process of assembling the upper 
nozzle 1 to the the top ends of the semi-assembled member 6, it 
is necessary to weld the upper nozzle 1 to the lengthy body of 
the semi-assembled member 6. Such a procedure demands expertise 
and is also time consuming. Furthermore, the welding operations 
are carried out in proximity to the fuel rods, and the workers 
were exposed to relatively high doses of radiation. US-A-3,791,466 relates to a method for making a fuel rod assembly 
structure for a nuclear reactor in which a sleeve 58 is brazed to a top grid 
22. A first bulging operation is performed for fixing the top grid 22 to 
the thimble tube 18 at a point just below the lower end of the sleeve 58 
and a second bulging operation is performed for fixing the tube 18 to the 
sleeves 58. Finally, a plate 13 of an upper end nozzle 12 is welded at 66 
to the upper end of the sleeve 58, that is, the final welding step is carried 
out close to the fuel rods. Therefore, there has been a need for an improvement in the 
assembling method, from the viewpoints of reducing the radiation 
exposure to the worker as well as achieving efficiency in 
assembling operation. In the field of technology of fixing the upper nozzle 1 to 
the top ends of the semi-assembled member 6,
