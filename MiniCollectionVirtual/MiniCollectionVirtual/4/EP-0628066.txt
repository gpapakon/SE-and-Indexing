<ABSTRACT>
Polymer blends having improved torque transmitting properties are disclosed. The polymer blends include polyetherurethane and a concentration of polyetherester sufficient to provide the polymer blend with a 37  DEG C dynamic torque value greater than 40 % of the polymer bland's 25  DEG C dynamic torque value. The polymer blend can be thermally processed to form small diameter tubing suitable for general purpose catheters requiring both a high degree of maneuverability and sufficient resiliency to avoid tissue perforation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a polymeric composition, usable in small diameter tubing
for catheter bodies. The composition is a
polymer blend useful for forming
catheter bodies having improved torque transmitting
properties for easy maneuverability through tortuous body
pathways yet having sufficient compliance to avoid tissue
perforation.Thermoplastic polymers, copolymers, and polymer blends
have been used extensively in the fabrication of medical
devices, including a wide range of long term and short term
implant devices. Many polymers and polymer blends used in
medical devices have specific physical and chemical
properties which make them particularly suitable for in
vivo applications. Preferred chemical, physical and
thermomechanical properties depend upon the specific
function, the type of tissue, cells or fluids contacting
the medical device and the acceptable or desired
manufacturing processes. Major considerations in choosing
polymers for medical devices include the chemical stability
of the polymer, particularly hydrolytic stability, the
toxicity of the polymer, and the degree of interaction
between tissue or blood and the polymer. Additionally, the
polymer or polymer blend should meet all the physical
demands relating to the function of the medical device
including strength, compliance, stiffness, torque and
rebound properties. Also, it should be compatible with and
contribute to stable manufacturing and assembly processes. Catheters represent a particularly large class of
medical devices used for a variety of in vivo
applications. Typically catheter bodies are formed of one
type of polymer, but more than one type can be incorporated
into the catheter body in order to provide a device which
meets the catheter's physical and chemical requirements.
One type of catheter which is widely utilized in a variety
of procedures is physically designed to be maneuvered
through tortuous fluid pathways within a body to a preselected
site. Once maneuvered into place the catheter and
its components are used to assist in the performance of a
variety of monitoring functions such as cardiac output
monitoring, pulmonary artery pressure monitoring and blood
chemistry analyses. The catheter is frequently allowed to
remain for a period of several days inside the body while
liquids and medicaments are infused through its lumens and
into the fluid pathway.In order to safely maneuver the catheter into place,
the material used to fabricate the catheter body should
have sufficient rebound and low enough bend
