<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for an adaptive texture mapping controller 
which provides a way for computer graphics system users or other functions in a graphical 

display system, to trade off object image rendering speed for object image texture quality. This 
trade-off is accomplished by providing a plurality of control signals to the adaptive texture mapping 

controller which indicate the level of texture quality that the user or other function desires. Upon 
recognizing these control signals, the adaptive texture mapping controller selects a computation 

method to be used in generating pixel values necessary to provide the desired level of image texture 
quality. 
The adaptive texture mapping controller is able to determine an appropriate method for calculating 
the end points of span sections of scan lines to be used for the display, based upon a function 

of the knot parameters which correspond to the vertices which describe each edge of a polygon section 
of the projected object and one or more of the control signals provided, and then to determine 

an appropriate interpolation method for calculating the pixel values for pixels on each span chosen, 
based on a function of the span end points and one or more of the control signals provided. These 

functions of the distance between knot parameters on a polygon edge or the distance between end 
points of a span can be mathematical functions of pairs of knot parameters or pairs of end points 

respectively. 
The adaptive texture mapping controller is able to determine an appropriate computation 
method for a given one of a plurality of hierarchical levels of image parameter calculation, where 

a set of control signals is supplied for each level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the field of Computer Graphics and to computer controlled
imaging systems and, more particularly, to a system for adaptively controlling quality/processing-speed
trade-offs in mapping texture onto object images for display.The goal of systems known in the prior art in the field of Computer Graphics has been to
provide the finest possible quality of texturing and lighting of computer graphic images at the lowest
possible processing cost. To date, certain mathematical models employed provide excellent quality
but are nevertheless expensive in terms of processing cost, whereas other models provide lesser quality
but are relatively fast (inexpensive) in image rendering. Those which provide excellent quality
usually calculate a texturing value for every pixel of every scan line of the video display of the object,
whereas the faster methods make use of some type of interpolation scheme for minimizing the numbers
of discrete pixel values that must be calculated. Whichever method is employed in a particular
Computer Graphics system, the user is constrained to use that method. That is, if the user has a
graphics system that provides high quality texture mapping but which is slow in rendering the texture
mapped images, he has no option to select lesser quality but faster rendering. If he wishes faster
rendering he must load a different graphics program that uses a different texture mapping scheme,
or perhaps use a different machine that has implemented a graphics engine system with a faster texture
mapping procedure.For purposes of further discussion, the following definitions will apply: Texture is defined
as a modulation of color, intensity, surface normal, transparency, or other surface property applied
to a surface of a graphics object in such a way that the pattern appears attached to the surface as the
viewpoint and perspective varies. For example, an image of woodgrain could be mapped onto a
polygon to simulate a hardwood floor. The image of woodgrain is typically represented by a table
of values referred to as a texture map. In general, texture maps are maps which store a set of values 
which represent a predetermined coloring, pattern or other predefined feature which is to be used
to embody the texture on a graphics object. The combination of the graphical representation of the
object and the embodied texture then forms a composite which is displayed, pixel by pixel, on a typical
video monitor. This process is more fully described with reference to Figure 1. Depicted
