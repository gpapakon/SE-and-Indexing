<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for enhancing 
ethylene yield in the conversion of oxygenates to 
hydrocarbons or olefins using microporous solid 
catalysts. More particularly, this invention relates 
to a process for enhancing ethylene yields using 
silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve catalysts 
through acid extraction of the catalysts. Light olefins have traditionally been produced 
through the process of petroleum cracking. Because of 
the limited availability and high cost of petroleum 
sources, the cost of producing light olefins from such 
petroleum sources has been steadily increasing. Light 
olefins such as ethylene serve as feeds for the 
production of numerous chemicals. The search for alternative materials for the 
production of light olefins such as ethylene has led 
to the use of oxygenates such as alcohols, and more 
particularly to methanol and ethanol or their 
derivatives as feedstocks. These and other alcohols 
may be produced by fermentation or from synthesis gas. 
Synthesis gas can be produced from natural gas, 
petroleum liquids, carbonaceous materials including 
coal, recycled plastics, municipal wastes, or any 
organic material. Thus, alcohol and alcohol 
derivatives may provide non-petroleum based routes for 
hydrocarbon production. Molecular sieves, such as the crystalline zeolite 
and silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) catalysts, are known 
to promote the conversion of oxygenates to hydrocarbon  
 
mixtures. Numerous patents describe this process for various 
types of molecular sieve catalysts: US-A-3,928,483; 
4,025,575; 4,252,479 (Chang, et al.) ;4,496,786 (Santilly, et 
al.); 4,677,243 (Kaiser). However, none of these patents 
teach or suggest that ethylene yield may be enhanced through 
treatment of the catalyst with acid. EP-A-116740 describes a process for the preparation of 
olefins with 2 to 4 carbon atoms from methanol and/or 
dimethylether. As catalyst a borosilicate zeolite is used; 
the catalyst is treated, after it has been calcined, with 
0.2 N HF, after which it can be treated to 1 to 3 hours with 
hydrochloric acid. The methanol used can contain up to 90% 
by weight of water, and the process can be performed at 
temperatures between 300 and 650°C. EP-A-22640 describes a catalyst which is used for the 
conversion of ethanol to ethylene and higher hydrocarbons. 
The catalyst which is a zeolite of the ZSM or related type, 
is treated with a hydrogen halide to improve its performance. 
The acid can be from 0.1 to 1.0 molar and the acid treatment 
can last from 1
