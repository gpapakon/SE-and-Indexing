<ABSTRACT>
The filling quantities are determined by termination of the filling process in such a manner that the level to which the liquid is poured into the bottles interrupts the reflux of gas out of the bottles through the return gas pipe (7) and causes the liquid valve (6) to be closed, the return gas pipe (7) being non-displaceably fixed at its level in the filling element in this process. In this process the vertical position of the reflux path of the returning gases taken from the bottle is adjusted with respect to the bottles and the seals of the bottles are vertically displaced on the filling elements, the quantity poured into the bottles being affected in this manner. According to the device, there is arranged on each stroke element (18) a stroke-limiting stop (25) and the sealing device has a sealing element (14) which can be moved vertically in the valve box.
