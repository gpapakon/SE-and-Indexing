<ABSTRACT>
Vehicle anti-lock brake control apparatus having wheel speed 
sensor (20-26) for detecting actual speed of a vehicle 

wheel, solenoid-operated valve (30) for regulating the wheel 
braking pressure, and controller (40) for controlling the 

valve, on the basis of the detected actual speed, and 
vehicle ground-speed detected by ground-speed sensor (8). 

The controller controls the valve at a controlled duty 
cycle, which is determined on the basis of at least a wheel 

speed error and a time derivative of this error. The error 
is obtained as a deviation of the detected actual wheel 

speed from a target wheel speed obtained on the basis of the 
detected vehicle ground-speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control apparatus for 
controlling an anti-lock brake system according to the preamble 
of claim 1, and more particulary to a technique for improving 
the accuracy of the control of the control apparatus. An anti-lock brake control system generally 
includes (a) a plurality of wheel speed sensors for 
detecting actual speeds of respective wheels of a motor 
vehicle, (b) an electrically controlled brake pressure 
regulating device having at least one solenoid-operated 
valve for regulating the braking pressure applied to each of 
the wheels, and (c) a controller for controlling the 
pressure regulating device so as to prevent locking or 
skidding of the wheel on a road surface, on the basis of a 
relationship between the actual speed of the wheel detected 
by the corresponding wheel speed sensor, and the running 
speed of the vehicle. An example of the anti-lock brake control 
apparatus of the type indicated above is known, for example,  
 
as a multiple-mode type as disclosed in 
JP-U-2-129960. In the multiple-mode type control 
apparatus disclosed in this publication, the pressure 
regulating device having the solenoid-operated pressure 
regulating valve or valves is operable in different pressure 
control modes such as a rapid pressure-increase mode, a slow 
pressure-increase mode, a pressure-hold mode, a rapid 
pressure-decrease mode and a slow pressure-decrease mode, 
and the controller estimates the vehicle running speed on 
the basis of the detected actual speeds of the wheels, at a 
predetermined cycle time, so that the controller selects one 
of the pressure control modes that is most suitable for 
restoring the actual speed of each wheel to a target or 
desired speed, depending upon the relationship between the 
estimated vehicle speed and the detected speed of the wheel 
in question. The controller activates the pressure 
regulating device in the selected pressure control mode for 
regulating the braking pressure to be applied to the wheel. In the known anti-lock brake control apparatus 
constructed as described above, the running speed of the 
vehicle is estimated based on the detected speeds of the 
plurality of wheels, on the assumption that the detected 
speed of at least one of the wheels is equal to the actual 
running speed of the vehicle. However, this arrangement does 
not assure a sufficiently high degree of accuracy in  
 
estimating the vehicle speed, since the above assumption is 
not always true. The known anti-lock brake control apparatus is
