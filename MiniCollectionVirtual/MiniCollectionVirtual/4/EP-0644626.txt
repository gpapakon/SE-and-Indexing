<ABSTRACT>
A keying arrangement for electrical connectors 
is for preventing the inadvertent mating of a 

plug (14) to the wrong receptacle (12). The opposing walls 
of the mating plug (14) and receptacle 

(12) have openings (52,53;36,37) formed therein that 
contain opposing keys (40,51;54,56,58). One key has a 

projection (44) and the other key (54,56,58) has a 
groove (70). The groove (70) is in alignment with the projection 

(44) where the plug (14) and receptacle (12) are designated 
to mate. The keys are used in pairs, one at each 

end of the connector to prevent partial mating and the 
resulting potential damage. The keys (40,51,54,56,58) are in 

diagonally opposite positions to prevent inadvertent partial mating 
along an edge of the connector. The keys are removable 

and replaceable so that keying configurations can be 
changed in the field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a keying system 
for very high density electrical connectors that 
prevents inadvertent mating or partial mating of 
connector halves that are not intended to be mated. In electrical equipment having multiple modules or 
units that are interconnected, it is desirable to 
provide a keying system that uniquely defines plug and 
receptacle pairs that are to be mated. There 
are many such systems in use in the industry. Such 
systems, however, are typically molded into the walls of 
the mating connector halves by adding to the wall 
thickness or by simply adding the key structure to the 
surface of an existing wall. An example of the first 
approach is illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 4,764,129 
which discloses mating electrical connector housings 
having plug keys that vary in width and corresponding 
receptacle openings that also vary in width. An example 
of the second approach is illustrated in U.S Patent No. 
4,376,565 which discloses mating electrical plug and 
receptacle housings having keying structures added to 
the outside of the plug wall and a corresponding 
projection on the receptacle wall to accommodate the 
necessary opening for receiving the plug key. Other 
keying arrangements utilize separate key structures that 
are added to the connector halves to effect the desired 
unique keying. An example of this keying approach is 
illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 5,044,994 which discloses 
a small high density connector wherein the plug has a 
key secured to an outside wall by a pair of flanges and 
the receptacle has a corresponding key secured to the 
inside surface of a wall so that when mated the two keys 
are mutually opposed. The receptacle and plug keys each 
have a groove and projection combination formed therein 
so that they mate. Such a structure requires that the  
 
connector be made wider to accommodate the keys than 
would otherwise be necessary. And, since all of the 
keys are on the same side of the connector, there is no 
provision for prevention of inadvertent mating of the 
contacts along the opposite edge of the connector. Such 
inadvertent mating can be harmful to the connector 
contacts as well as to the circuitry on the circuit 
board and to related equipment. What is needed is a connector keying arrangement 
that effectively prevents inadvertent partial mating of 
the contacts of a plug with the contacts of a receptacle 
either along an edge of the connector or an end thereof. 
Additionally, the keying arrangement should not require 
that the

plug (14) having a plug housing (26) and a receptacle 

(12) having a receptacle housing (16), each plug (14) 
and receptacle (12) having matable electrical contacts 

(74,86) therein for electrical connection therebetween, 
a first keying arrangement (22,24,32,34) for 

polarization to assure proper orientation of said plug 
(14) with respect to said receptacle, and a second 

keying arrangement to assure proper mating of the plug 
(14) to a designated receptacle (12), characterized in 

that; 
   the second keying arrangement includes first 

openings (36,37) in opposite side walls (18,20) of said 
receptacle housing (16); 

   second openings (52,53) in opposite side walls 
(28,30) of said plug housing (26) substantially opposed 

to said first openings (36,37) when said plug (26) and 
receptacle (16) housings are in mated engagement; 

   first keys (40,51) to fit into said first openings 
and having a projection (44) at a preselected location 

thereon; and 
   second keys (54,58) to fit into said second 

openings and having a groove (62) at a preselected 
location thereon for receiving said projection (44); 

   wherein each of said projections (44) and each of 
said grooves (62) are positioned in one of a plurality 

of discrete selectable positions, and wherein said plug 
(26) and receptacle (16) housings will mate only when 

said projections (44) of said first keys (40,51) are

each of said keys includes an ear (42,60) that is 

received in an undercut (48,53) of said openings, said 
ear (42,60) having a shallow projection (46,59) that 

interferingly engages a wall of said undercut (48,53)
