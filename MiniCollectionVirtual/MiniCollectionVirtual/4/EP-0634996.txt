<DESCRIPTION>
 NAPHTHOQUINONE DERIVATIVES WITH ANTI-PROTOZOAL AND ANTI-PARASTIC ACTIVITYThe present invention relates to naphthoquinones and their use in chemotherapy. More specifically the invention is concerned with novel carbonate and carbamate derivatives of hydroxynaphthoquinones, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical formulations thereof and their use in the chemotherapy of certain pro ozoal and parasitic infections.Parasitic protozoal infections are responsible for a wide variety of diseases of medical and veterinary importance, including malaria in man and various coccidioses in birds, fish and mammals. Many of the diseases are life-threatening to the host and cause considerable economic loss in animal husbandry. Parasitic protozoa include the Apicomplexa, such as species of Eimeria, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, and Plasmodium. Another parasitic organism of increasing concern is Pneumocvstis carinii. which can cause an often-fatal pneumonia in immunodeficient or immunocompromised hosts, including those infected with HIV. The classification of this organism is unclear and there is still uncertainty as to whether it is a protozoan or a fungus.A wide range of naphthoquinones is known in the art. Such compounds have been variously described as having antimalarial, anticoccidial and antitheilerial activity. Some compounds have also been described as possessing activity against external parasites. Thus, Fieser et. al. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1948, 22,, 3156-3165 (and references cited therein) describes a large number of 2-substituted-3-hydroxy-l,4-naph- thoquinones as having antimalarial activity. A number of these compounds have also been described in U.S. Patent Specification No. 2 553 648. Further classes of 2-substituted-3-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoqui- nones having activity as antimalarial, anticoccidial and/or antitheilerial agents are described i U.S. Patents Nos. 3 367 830, and 3 347 742, U.K. Patent Specification No. 1553424, and European Patent Specifications Nos. 2 228, 77551, 77550 and 123,238. 

European Patent Application No. 362996 discloses, for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of infections caused by Pneumocvs is carinii, 1,4-naphthoquinones of formula:where R is an optionally substituted, C_ non-aromatic hydrocarbon residue and R is inter alia a group -0C0RC, OR , SR or NReR , which compounds are said to be believed to act as pro-drugs of compounds wherein R is a hydroxyl group.It has now been found that a 1,4-naphthoquinone substituted at the 2-position by a carbamate group exhibits good activity
