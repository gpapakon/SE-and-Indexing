<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide an 
electrostatic coating method employing a powder coating which 

provides for good transfer efficiency with consequent 
reduction of powder recovery load and, hence, is useful for 

conservation of resources and management of wastes. 
The present invention relates to a coating process applying 
a powder coating on the surface of the substrates formed with 

plastic or coated coat by electrostatic coating method wherein 
the temperature of said substrates is brought to a level not 

below the glass transition temperature of the component resin 
of said powder coating or the glass transition temperature of 

the component resin of of said plastic or coated coat prior to 
application of said powder coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a coated
article according to the preamble clause of claim 1. Said coated article
may include surface-coated metal or surface-coated plastics products such
as for example automotive parts, building materials, constructional members,
household appliance parts, and similar coated articles.A method of said type is known from document EP-A-0 372 740. In detail,
said document discloses a method of coating a plastic substrate comprising
the steps of:
a) preheating the substrate at a temperature and for a time sufficient
to degas the substrate; the temperature being above the temperature
sufficient to cure a subsequently applied powder coating composition;b) applying immediately a powder coating composition to the preheated
substrate above the temperature sufficient to cure the powder coating
composition; andc) heating immediately the coated substrate at a temperature and for
a time sufficient to cure the powder coating composition.The times and temperatures for this known preheating step will vary
somewhat depending on the identity of the substrate and the powder
coating composition. Typically, the temperature will be at least 149째 C,
and preferably 163 to 204째 C, and the preheating time typically will be
at least 15 minutes, usually from 15 to 60 minutes. After the preheating
step, the powder coating composition is immediately (i.e., before the
substrate cools below the curing temperature of the powder coating composition) 
applied to the preheated substrate. Preferably, the powder coating
composition may be applied by electrostatic spraying. After the powder
coating composition has been applied, the coated substrate is then heated
immediately (i.e., before the substrate cools below the curing temperature
of the powder coating composition) at a temperature and for a time sufficient
to cure the powder coating composition. At no time during the coating
process should the temperature of the substrate be allowed to drop below
the curing temperature of the powder coating composition.When a plastics substrate is coated with a powder coating composition
by means of a powder coating process, there is a danger of the so-called
"popping", which may occur due to a surface porosity of the substrate.
"Popping" results in a removal of small or larger pieces of the coating
layer and deteriorates the appearance of the coating surface.The fore-mentioned coating method (which is also disclosed in Japanese
Kokai Publication Hei-2-194878) seeks to avoid said popping by
