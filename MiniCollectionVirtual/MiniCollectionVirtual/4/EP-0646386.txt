<ABSTRACT>
A medical device for advancing or retracting an elongate 
member (12) is disclosed. The device is made up of a flexible 

tube (4). The elongate member (12) is connected to a bead 
(22). The bead (22) and elongate member (12) are disposed 

axially within the tube (4). An advancer (10) is provided 
which squeezes the walls of the tube (4) together around the 

bead (22). The elongate member (12) is thus advanced or retracted 
in the tube (4). The bead (22) is provided with grooves (25a-25d) 

to facilitate the flow of fluid through the tube (4). The 
elongate object (12) may be an obturator or a probe for detecting 

a physiological parameter. Also disclosed is a method for 
advancing or retracting an elongate member (12). The method 

has the steps of connecting the elongate member (12) to a 
bead-like object (22), enclosing the elongate member (12) 

and the bead (22) within a hollow flexible tube (4), squeezing 
the tube (4) near the bead-like object (22) and imparting 

a substantially axial force to the tube (4) such that the 
force is transmitted to the bead (22), thereby advancing the 

bead (22) and the elongate object (12) axially along the tube 
(4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for advancing an object such as an 
obturator, a needle or a probe into the body via a catheter. In the course of medical treatment it is often desirable to infuse fluids such as 
medications into, or withdraw fluids from a patient. This is typically accomplished 
by the introduction of a catheter into the patient in order to gain access to the 
vascular system of the patient. In such cases, it is sometimes desirable to occlude 
the catheter between successive infusions or withdrawals of fluid in order to 
maintain the patency of the catheter. Examples of devices for performing such an 
operation may be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,201,712 and 4,976,697. It has also become desirable to introduce certain therapeutic or measurement 
devices into the body via a catheter. For example, an invasive blood pressure 
sensor or blood gas sensor may be introduced into a blood vessel through a catheter. The present invention is intended to provide a device for advancing an object 
such as an obturator or probe into the body without exposing the object to infection. The present invention relates to a device for advancing or retracting an 
elongate member through a catheter. The elongate member may be a device such as 
an obturator or a probe for detecting a physiological parameter. The device is made 
up of a flexible tube having a first end and a second end, a lumen and a flexible 
wall. The tube is dimensioned to accommodate the elongate object in the lumen. A  
 
connector is provided to connect the first end of the tube to a catheter. Secured to 
the elongate member is a bead-like object. An advancer is attached to the tube to 
impart force to the bead-like object, thereby causing the elongate member to move 
axially within the lumen. The invention also includes a method for advancing or retracting an elongate 
member. The method has the steps of connecting the elongate member to a bead-like 
object, enclosing the elongate member and the bead within a hollow flexible 
tube, squeezing the tube near the bead-like object and imparting a substantially axial 
force to the tube such that the force is transmitted to the bead, thereby advancing the 
bead and the elongate object axially along the tube. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the invention; Fig. 2 is a partial cross-sectional view through section 2-2 showing an 
obturator or probe in its advanced position; Fig. 3 is a partial cross-sectional view through section 2-2 showing the 
obturator or probe in a retracted position;

<CLAIMS>
A device for advancing or retracting an elongate member axially through a medical 
catheter, comprising: 

   a medical catheter; 
   an elongate member comprising a proximal end and a distal end; 

   a flexible tube having a proximal and a distal end, a lumen and a flexible wall, the 
flexible tube being dimensioned to accommodate the elongate member axially in the lumen; 

   connecting means for connecting the distal end of the flexible tube to the catheter; 
and 

   an object secured to the elongate member, the elongate member and object being 
slidably located in the lumen of the flexible tube, such that imparting an axial force to the 

object through the wall of the flexible tube causes the elongate member and the object to 
move axially through the lumen toward or away from the proximal end of the flexible tube. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the object is a bead. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the object is secured to the second end of the 
elongate member. 
The device of claim 1 further comprising an advancer axially and slidably mounted 
on the flexible tube such that imparting an axial force to the advancer causes axial force to 

be imparted to the object through the flexible wall of the tube, thereby causing the elongate 
member to move axially within the lumen. 
The device of claim 4 wherein the advancer comprises means for moving the 
object axially along the lumen by squeezing the flexible tube, thereby causing part of the wall 

of the flexible tube to come into contact with the object as the advancer is advanced axially 
along the tube. 
The device of claim 4, wherein the means for advancing comprise means for 
pinching the tube so that part of the tube comes into contact with the object. 
The device of claim 6 wherein the means for advancing comprise a plurality of 
opposed ribs and the tube is pinched between the opposed ribs when the advancing means 

is moved axially along the tube. 
The device of claim 6 wherein the advancing means comprise a plurality of 
opposed ribs for progressively pinching the tube when the advancing means is moved in 

along the tube in the direction of the second end. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the elongate member is an obturator. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the elongate member is a probe for detecting a 
physiological parameter. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the object is provided with at least one groove to 
permit fluid flow through the lumen.
