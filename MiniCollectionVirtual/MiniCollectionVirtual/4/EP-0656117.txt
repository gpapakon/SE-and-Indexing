<ABSTRACT>
It has been found that the ligands of the group of cytokins similar to Interleukin 6 (IL-6), that is Oncostatin M (OSM), Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) and Interleukin 11 (IL-11), induce formation of a receptor complex of which the membrane molecule gp 130 is a part. It is thus possible to formulate the hypothesis that two different surfaces of the protein (in this class of hormones), known as site 1 and site 2, bind to two different molecules: site 1 to the specific receptor and site 2 to gp 130. The invention allows the identification of these sites and the isolation of variants having, with respect to the wild hormone, a greater affinity for the specific receptor (superagonists and superantagonists) or affinity for gp 130 reduced or abolished (antagonists and superantagonists). The figure shows the construct pHen DELTA  hIL-6 and the production of phasmidic particles that can be used to select agonists of Interleukin 6.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a methodology for
selecting superagonists, antagonists and superantagonists
of Interelukin 6 whose receptor complex includes gp 130.As is known, WO 92/21029 to Genentec Inc. teaches a
method for determination of agonists or antagonists of
growth hormones and ligands with a similar structural
conformation. The potential agonists and antagonists are
put into contact with a receptor for the hormone and this
causes formation of a ternary complex consisting of a
molecule of the potential agonist or antagonist and two
molecules of such receptor for the hormone to be agonized
or antagonized. Dimerization of receptors induced by a
ligand molecule allows to conclude that the ligand has
two different interaction sites (site 1 and site 2), on
which it is possible to operate using mutagenesis to
generate agonists or antagonists.It has now been surprisingly found that the ligands
in the group of cytokines similar to Interleukin 6 (IL-6),
that is Oncostatin M (OSM), Leukemia Inhibitory
Factor (LIF), Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF), and
Interleukin 11 (IL-11), induce the formation of a
receptor complex of which the membrane molecule gp 130 is
a part. In this receptor complex the specific receptor
for each of these cytokins and the membrane molecule gp
130 are always present as common elements. It is thus
possible to formulate the hypothesis that site 1 and site
2 bind to two different molecules in this class of
hormones: site 1 to the specific receptor and site 2 to
gp 130.Identification of the two sites is made possible, as
will be seen more clearly from the following, by 
construction of a three-dimensional model of the
receptor complex based on the functional similarity
between sequences of the human growth hormone receptor
(hGH) and sequences of the receptors for the hormones
in question. Isolation of variants that, with respect
to the wild type hormone, have a greater affinity for
the specific receptor (superagonists or
superantagonists) is obtained by construction of
filamentous phage libraries, for example M13, carrying
the hormone, both in the wild type and mutant version.The difference between the three-dimensional
model, for example of IL-6, adopted here and the one
adopted in WO92/21029 leads to hypothesize different
residues in helix A and C as constituents of site 2.Modelling of the human interleukin 6 molecule is
performed as follows. Knowing, from data available in
scientific literature, that human interleukin 6 belongs
to a class of cytokines that have four helices

<CLAIMS>
A methodology for selecting superagonists,
antagonists and superantagonists of interleukin 6 using

the membrane molecule gp 130 to activate the mechanisms
regulating cell physiology, comprising the following

operations:

comparing the amino acid sequences of the growth
hormone with the sequences of interleukin 6;
comparing the amino acid sequences of the growth
hormone receptor with those of the two receptors of

interleukin 6, that is with the interleukin 6-specific
receptor and gp 130;
on the basis of the above comparisons, formulating
a three-dimensional model of the receptor complex based

on the

functional similarity between sequences on the
growth hormone receptor and the two interleukin 6

receptors in question;
identifying the residues of the wild type
interleukin 6 that form a part of the site of interaction

with the specific receptor and the site of interaction
with gp 130, respectively;

introduction of mutations into the interaction sites
of interleukin 6; and
evaluation of the biological activity of the
mutants.
