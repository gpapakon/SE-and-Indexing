<ABSTRACT>
An ignition device comprises a housing (1) with branch pipes (2, 3) for the delivery of air and gaseous fuel into the 
cavity of the housing (1) within which are mounted: a detonation tube (4), the inlet of which communicates with an outlet pipe 

(7) for releasing some of the fuel-air mixture from the cavity of the housing (1); a section (12) of the detonation tube close to the 
said inlet extending beyond the confines of the housing (1) and having mounted on it an electrical spark plug (13); a device (15) 

for forming a jet mounted towards the working end (16) of the housing (1); and an indicator device (17) to detect the presence of 
a jet. The device (15) for forming a jet is designed in the form of a generator (18) which produces a stream of fuel-air mixture in 

the form of a non-continuous ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to means of lightning 
up burners of power boiler units, petrochemical plants 
as well as other furnace plants, and, more specifically, 
to ignition devices. The problem of explosion-proof lightning up of burners 
in furnace plants of various functions remains topical up 
to the present days. It is associated, mainly, with the 
lack of reliable ignition devices and indicators which 
announce the presence of flares in said devices. The known iginition devices are marked first of all 
by an inadequately well organized operational process. Thus, for instance, in the ignition devices with burning 
inside the housing or behind the nozzle inside the 
ceramic tunnel having rod-type burning stabilizers, it is 
impossible to provide a sufficiently long service life and 
design reliability because of the structure element heating 
and thermal shocks during inflammation. Said ignition 
devices display a low reliability of operation: a part of 
the flare is concealed in the housing, which reduces the 
effectiveness of the thermo-chemical effect on the flare 
to be ignited; a low-pressure flare is insufficiently 
stable in cocurrent flows and more so in deviating flows, 
with the ignition device located at an angle to the burner 
axis; there is a possibility of explosions in the ignition 
device housing during an attempt to trigger it, which reduces 
the reliabilty in the flare formation by the ignition 
device; a dependence of the ignition device operational 
mode and the reliability of its inflammation on the pressure 
in the furnace. Ignition devices with internal burning require a higher 
air pressure since they have to overcome losses in  
 
the total pressure, associated with the heat release inside 
the through part of the ignition device. Any attempts to 
increase the length of the ignition devices with internal 
burning (for the burners of power boilers of a high capacity 
the required length of ignition devices can amount up 
to 5000 mm) has resulted in problems, incident to the 
dynamic instability of the process, during which, as a 
rule, there are two types of instability observed: periodic 
(monotonic drawing-in of the flare inside the housing 
of the device) and oscillatory instability, when low-frequency 
sound oscillations are generated, accompanied by 
oscillations of the flare (instability of the thermo-acoustic 
nature). It is especially well demonstrated in the ignition 
device of the eddy type, the dynamic instability of which 
limits the length of the ignition
