Process for the preparation of compounds having at 
least one primary or secondary amine function and at 

least one polyoxyalkylated chain, characterised in 
that 


at least one amino alcoholate (B), obtained from 
an amino alcohol (A) comprising at least one OH group 

and having at least one primary or secondary amine 
function, by replacing a fraction of or all the OH 

groups with OM groups, M being an atom selected from 
sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium, said amino 

alcohols (A) and the amino alcoholate (B) being devoid 
of groups capable of reacting with one another, or 

with a function carried by the amino alcohol (A) or 
the amino alcoholate (B) in the reactive conditions of 

the process;
 
is caused to react with 
an oxiran, a mixture of oxirans or an oxirans 
sequence, in an aprotic and anhydrous solvent, in an 

anhydrous atmosphere and at a temperature of between 
0째C and 200째C, in order to attach to each atom of 

oxygen originating either from an OH group or an OM 
group a series of "m" motifs, either the same or 

different, m being a whole number greater than or 
equal to 1, preferably lying between 1 and 10 000, 

said "m" motifs corresponding to the following 
formula: 


-[C(R
1
)(R
2
) - C(R
3
)(R
4
) - O]-
 
wherein R
1
, R
2
, R
3
 and R
4
 are the same or different, and 
may be selected from within the group comprising: 


the hydrogen atom 
monovalent radicals, either saturated or not,  
 

alkyl, cyclo-alkyl or aryl, 
said radicals possibly including various 
substituents which are non-reactive with respect 

to an amine function or an alcoholate function. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the number "m" of motifs lies between 1 and 500, in 

particular between 1 and 250. 
Process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised 
in that M is selected from potassium, rubidium and 

caesium. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterised in that M 
is potassium. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the amino alcohol (A) 

corresponds to the following formula (III): 

[(HNRi)
j
Q](OH)
(r+q)
 
wherein: 


j is the number of primary or secondary amine 
functions, which are identical to or different from 

one another, j varying from 1 to 10 inclusive, 
r is the sum of the numbers of OH groups carried 
by all the Ri components, and q is the number of OH 

groups carried by Q, r+q being greater than or equal 
to 1 and may be as much as 10, 
Q represents an organic radical containing 2 to 
50 carbon atoms,  

 
each Ri is a hydrogen atom or an organic radical 
containing 1 to 50 carbon atoms, 
when the amino alcohol (A) includes more than one 
primary or secondary amine function, the Ri components 

may be the same or different from one another, 
Q and Ri can be carriers of hetero-atoms and/or 
have various substituents, 
Q, N and the Ri components may together form one 
or several cycles, and this cycle or these cycles may, 

moreover, contain one or several other hetero-atoms, 
Q and the Ri components must be devoid of groups 
capable of reacting with one another or with other 

groups carried by the amino alcohol (A) or the amino 
alcoholate (B) in the reactive conditions of the 

process according to the invention. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that the number of OM groups is 

greater than 30%, preferably greater than 40%, of the 
sum of the number of OM groups and the number of OH 

groups. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in that the oxiran used in the first 

stage is selected from the group comprising ethylene 
oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, amylene oxide, 

octylene oxide, styrene oxide, methyl styrene oxide, 
cyclohexane oxide, their various substituted 

derivatives, and mixtures thereof. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
the oxiran is selected from the group comprising 

ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, styrene oxide and 
mixtures thereof.  

 
Process according to Claim 8, characterised in that 
the oxiran is ethylene oxide. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
 
characterised in that the aprotic and anhydrous 

solvent is selected from tetrahydrofuran, diethyl 
glycol dimethyl ether, dimethylsulphoxide or 

hexamethylphosphoreamide. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 10,
 
characterised in that the addition of oxiran is 

carried out at a temperature between 20째C and 120째C. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 11,
 
characterised in that the amino alcohol (A) is 

selected from the following components: 

ethanolamine 
diethanolamine 
propanol amines 
N-methyl ethanolamine 
amino-4-cyclohexanol 
diamino-propanol-2 
N-decyl ethanolamine. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 12,
 
characterised in that it is followed by a stage of 

rendering each oxygen atom terminating a 
polyoxyalkylated chain neutral or functional. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 13,
 
characterised in that it is followed by a stage, 

during which at least one of the primary or secondary 
amine functions of the product obtained is caused to 

react in a known manner.
