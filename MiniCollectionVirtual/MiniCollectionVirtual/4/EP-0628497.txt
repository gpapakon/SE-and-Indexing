<ABSTRACT>
One of the most well-known types of packaging for cigarettes is the hinged-lid box. The industrial production of known hinged-lid boxes is complex because the collar which is customary in hinged-lid boxes is made as a separate blank. In the present hinged-lid box, the collar (19) and the hinged lid (18) are connected to one another by residual connections (40) consisting of the packaging material. The residual connections can be separated when the hinged lid is opened for the first time.
