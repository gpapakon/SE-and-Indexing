<ABSTRACT>
Seat belts in a vehicle are monitored, and a reminder 
is initiated in response to a restraint sensor (11, 12, 13, 

14) indicating the engaged or non engaged state of a seat 
restraint, a vehicle sensor (15) indicating when the vehicle 

is in use, an annunciator (18, 19) controllably producing a 
reminder, and an electronic control (10) controlling the 

annunciator (18, 19). The reminder is produced when the 
seat restraint is in a non engaged state after having been 

an engaged state while the vehicle is in use. Thus, 
monitoring of the continued buckling of a seat belt, 

especially a rear seat belt, is provided without need for 
seat occupan
cy sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to automotive
restraint systems, and more specifically to a method and
system for monitoring seat belt use.Active restraints, such as seat belts, require each
vehicle occupant to manually engage his or her seat belt.
The engaged state of seat belts is often electrically
monitored, and reminder signals are given when an occupant
fails to engage their seat belt.Since a reminder is useful only when a particular seat
belt is disengaged and the respective seat is actually
occupied, typical prior art systems use seat occupancy
sensors to determine the presence of an occupant in a
particular seat. Such sensors typically comprise a load-responsive
electrical switch installed within the seat.
These prior art systems also require special seat
construction and wiring.In view of the wide acceptance and use of seat belts,
especially by drivers, and the practice of many drivers to
insure that all passengers are buckled up before driving, it
is very useful to know if a seat belt becomes disconnected
or disengaged during driving. The driver cannot easily
monitor the seat belt use of passengers, especially rear
seat passengers, during driving since his/her attention is
directed to the act of driving. However, due to
reconfigurable seating arrangements, specialised seats, and
other seat packaging issues, rear seat occupancy sensors are
sometimes not available.The present invention advantageously monitors seat
belts, especially rear seat belts, for disconnection or
disengagement during driving in a manner not requiring
occupancy sensors.JA-A-63192640 discloses a switch for detecting
open/close condition of door, an ignition key switch for 
detecting drive/stop of engine, a seat switch for detecting
the seating condition of passenger, and a belt switch for
detecting the applying condition of seat belt are provided,
and values detected through respective switches are inputted
to a microcomputer. At the same time, pulse strains having
period corresponding to the moving speed condition of
vehicle are outputted from a speed pulse signal generator.
Different alarms are produced corresponding to the vehicle
speed when the seat belt is not applied, so as to inform the
degree of danger to the passenger corresponding to the
vehicle speed thus preventing missing of application of seat
belt and ensuring safety.According to the present invention there is provided a
monitoring and reminder system to monitor a seat restraint
in a vehicle during driving and to produce a reminder when
the seat
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A monitoring and reminder system to monitor a seat
restraint in a vehicle during driving and to produce a

reminder when the seat restraint is disengaged or
disconnected during driving, the system comprising:


a restraint sensor (11, 12) for generating a restraint
signal indicative of the engaged or non engaged state of

said seat restraint;
a vehicle sensor (15) for generating a use signal when
said vehicle is in use;
a door position sensor (12,13) mounted proximate to a
door of said vehicle for detecting ah open and a closed

position of the door;
an annunciator (18, 19) for controllably producing a
reminder; and
an electronic control (10) coupled to said annunciator
(18, 19) to control p
roduction of said reminder when said
seat restraint is in the non-engaged state while the vehicle

is in use 
characterised in that
 said control (10), when the
vehicle is in use, monitors the vehicle sensor (15), the

door position sensor (12,13) and the restraint sensor
(11,12) and controls the annunciator (18,19) to produce an

alarm when the vehicle sensor (15) indicates that the
vehicle is in use, the door position sensor (12,13)

indicates that the door is in the closed position and the
restraint sensor (11,12) indicates that the seat restraint

is in a non-engaged state after having been in an engaged
state while the vehicle is in use, said alarm being

cancelled when the vehicle is put out of use, the door is
opened or said seat restraint is back in the engaged state.
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
electronic control includes a delay timer and wherein said 

reminder is generated periodically until said seat restraint
returns to said engaged state.
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said seat
restraint is comprised of a seat belt and buckle and wherein

said restraint sensor is comprised of a switch responsive to
engagement of said buckle.
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
annunciator is comprised of an audible tone generator and/or

an indicator light.
A method of monitoring a seat restraint in a
vehicle during driving and of producing a reminder when the

seat restraint is disengaged or disconnected during driving,
said method comprising the steps of:


detecting the engaged or non engaged state of said seat
restraint;
detecting whether the vehicle is in use;
detecting the open or closed position of a door of said
vehicle; and
producing the reminder when the seat restraint is in
the non-engaged state while the vehicle is in use;

   
characterised in that
 the method further comprises
producing an alarm, when the vehicle is in use, the door is

in the closed position and the seat restraint is in a non-engaged
state after having been in an engaged state while

the vehicle is in use, said alarm being cancelled when the
vehicle is put out of use, the door is opened or said seat

restraint is back in the engaged state.
A method as claimed in claim 5 further comprising
the steps of: 


initiating a predetermined delay period after
annunciating said reminder for a predetermined time; and
inhibiting said reminder during said predetermined
delay period.
A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein a plurality
of individual seat restraints are monitored for indicating

the engaged or non engaged state of a respective individual
seat restraint.
