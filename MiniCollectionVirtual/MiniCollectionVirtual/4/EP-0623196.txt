<ABSTRACT>
A floating caliper disc brake as claimed has a fixed brake bearer (1) with two bearer arms (2, 3) extending beyond the outer edge (4) of a brake disc (5). On both sides of the brake disc (5) there are brake shoes (6, 7) which are movably supported on the bearer arms (2, 3) and surrounded by a floating caliper (14) guided so as to be axially movable on the brake bearer (1). A spring arrangement operating axially on the brake shoes (6, 7) to release the brake reinforces the setting of a clearance between the brake shoes (6, 7) and the brake disc (5) after braking. According to the invention, the spring arrangement has at least one expansion spring (19, 20, 28, 29, 40, 41) which is axially immovably secured to a section of a bearer arm (2, 3) of the brake bearer (1) above the outer edge (4) of the brake disc (5). The expansion spring (19, 20, 28, 29, 40, 41) has at least two spring arms (22, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, 45, 46, 47) which bear axially flexibly on the back-plates (8) of the brake shoes (6, 7). The spring arrangement of the invention advantageously ensures an even distribution of the clearance over the brake shoes (6, 7).

<CLAIMS>
A floating-caliper disc brake including a stationary brake 
carrier (1) provided with two carrier arms (2, 3) protruding 

beyond the outer rim (4) of a brake disc (5), brake shoes (6, 
7) disposed on either side of the brake disc (5) and each 

having a friction pad (9) and a back plate (8), with the 
brake shoes being displaceably supported on the carrier arms 

(2, 3), a floating caliper (14) guided in axially 
displaceable manner on the brake carrier (1) and embracing 

the brake shoes (6, 7) and being furnished with an actuator 
(17) intended for applying the brake shoes (6, 7) against the 

brake disc (5), further comprising a spring assembly axially 
acting, in the brake releasing direction, on the brake shoes 

(6, 7) and supporting, after braking, the adjustment of a 
clearance between the brake shoes (6, 7) and the brake disc 

(5), the spring assembly including at least one expander 
spring (19, 20) which, generally, is undisplaceably secured, 

in the axial direction, to one of the carrier arms (2, 3) of 
the brake carrier (1), the fixation being effected on a 

section of the carrier arm (2, 3) located above the outer rim 
(4) of the brake disc (5), and the expander spring (19, 20) 

comprising at least two spring struts (22, 23; 24, 25) which 
are in resilient abutment, in the axial direction, with the 

back plates (8) of the brake shoes (6, 7),
characterized
 in that the expander spring (19, 
20) comprises a mounting section (26, 27) bent in loop-type 

manner, from which emerge two spring struts (22, 23; 24, 25) 
disposed with respect to one another in V-type manner, and in 

that the mounting section (26, 27) embraces a notch-type nail 
(21) arranged on a carrier arm (2, 3) or a screw.  

 
A disc brake as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the expander spring (19, 
20) comprises two substantially identical spring struts (22, 

23; 24, 25) disposed in substantially symmetrical relationship 
to the brake disc plane. 
A disc brake as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that two expander springs (19, 
20) are provided, and one of them is located on each carrier 

arm (2, 3). 
A disc brake as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that the two expander springs 
(19, 20) are of identical design. 
A disc brake as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
comprising projections (10, 11, 12, 13), in particular, of 

hammer head-type configuration, extending in the circumferential 
direction and located on the back plates (8) of the 

brake shoes (6, 7), which projections are in axially 
displaceable abutment with the carrier arms (2, 3) and serve 

for transmitting the friction forces to the brake carrier (1) 
which develop on the brake shoes (6, 7) during braking,
characterized
 in that the spring struts (22, 23, 
24, 25) of the expander springs (19, 20) are in axially 

resilient abutment with the axial sides of the projections 
(10, 11, 12, 13) facing the brake disc (5).  

 
A disc brake as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the expander spring (19, 
20) is integrally formed of spring wire.
