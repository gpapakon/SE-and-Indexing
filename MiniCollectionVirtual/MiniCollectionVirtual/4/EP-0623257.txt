<ABSTRACT>
A monolithic integrated MOS high-level stage component, in particular a DMOS high-level stage, has a high-level stage element (10) provided with a GATE, a SOURCE and a DRAIN connection, as well as an overload protection arrangement. An integrated GATE pre-resistance (11) connects an outer GATE connection (Ga) of the high-level stage component to the GATE-connection (Gi) of the high-level stage element (10). The overload protection arrangement is integrated in the high-level stage component and has a level adapter stage (30) which causes the transmission characteristic curve of the high-level stage element (10) to be displaced by a defined voltage offset value when the GATE pre-resistance (11) is crossed by a defined current. A limiting stage (34) limits the cumulative value of the DRAIN-SOURCE voltage and of a voltage proportional to the DRAIN current to a predetermined value. An overload protection arrangement in a monolithic integrated form having an improved protective function may thus be achieved at a reduced cost, as the physical limitations of the semiconductor can be better used.
