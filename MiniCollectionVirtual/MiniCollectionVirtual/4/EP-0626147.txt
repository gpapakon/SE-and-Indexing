<ABSTRACT>
An article support has a support part (2) and a clamping part (3), by means of which the article support (1) can be attached to a perforated wall and which is connected to the support part (2) by a joint (8). In order to establish in a simple way a better connection between support part (2), clamping part (3) and perforated wall, the clamping part (3) has an intermediate lug which projects from the main plane of the clamping part (3), the length of which is slightly greater than the distance between two wires of the support part (2) running parallel to one another and which, when the clamping part (3) is pivoted into the clamping position, penetrates between the mutually parallel wires.

Product support with a supporting part 
(2) and a clamping part (3), by means of which the 

product support (1) can be mounted on a perforated 
wall and which is connected to the supporting part 

(2) by means of an articulation (8), characterised 
in that the clamping part (3) comprises an 

intermediate tab (11), which projects out of the 
main plane of the clamping part (3), and the 

length of which is slightly greater than the 
distance between two wires (6, 7) of the 

supporting part (2) which wires extend parallel to 
one another, and which tab, during the pivoting 

of the clamping part (3) into the clamping 
setting, penetrates between the wires (6, 7) which 

are parallel to one another. 
Product support according to Claim 1, in 
the case of which the free longitudinal edge (12) 

of the intermediate tab (11) is slightly longer 
than the connection line between the intermediate 

tab (11) and the clamping part (3), such that both 
side edges (13) of the interim tab (11) are formed 

at a slant. 
Product support according to Claim 1 or 
Claim 2, in the case of which the intermediate tab  

 
(11) is bent out of the main plane of the clamping 

part (3) by means of a punching process. 
Product support with a supporting part 
(2) and a clamping part (3), by means of which the 

product support (1) can be mounted on a perforated 
wall and which is connected to the supporting part 

(2) by means of an articulation (8), characterised 
in that the clamping part (3) comprises two 

retaining tabs (16, 17) which project out of the 
main plane of the clamping part (3), the distance 

of which tabs from one another is slightly smaller 
than the diameter of a wire (14) of the supporting 

part (2) and which tabs thus form, between them, a 
clamping opening (18) for the wire (14) of the 

supporting part (2), and which, during the 
pivoting of the clamping part (3) into the 

clamping position, clamp the wire (14) of the 
supporting part (2) between them in the clamping 

opening (18). 
Product support according to Claim 4, in 
the case of which the maximum width of the 

clamping opening (18) is not at the opening 
surface thereof. 
Product support according to Claim 5, in 
the case of which the one retaining tab (16)  

 
comprises a slope (19) for the purpose of 

progressive narrowing of the clamping opening (18) 
in the entry direction of the wire (14), wherein 

the other retaining tab (17) comprises, in the 
vicinity of the opening surface of the clamping 

opening (18) a nose (20) reducing the width of the 
opening surface. 
Product support according to any one of 
Claims 4 to 6, in the case of which the retaining 

tabs (16, 17) are bent out of the main plane of 
the clamping part (3) by means of a punching 

process.
