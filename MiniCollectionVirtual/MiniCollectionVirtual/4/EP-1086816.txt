<ABSTRACT>
An ink cartridge 10 comprises an ink tank 12 defined by a plurality of surfaces 20, 22,
24, 28, 30. A group of ink outlet apertures 38 is defined in the floor 28 of the ink tank

12. The ink tank floor 28 is flat in the vicinity of the ink outlet apertures 38. The
cartridge 10 includes an ink supply port 16 to receive the end of an ink withdrawal

needle 82 so that ink can be withdrawn from the tank 12. A seal 44;90 is provided in
the ink supply port 16, the seal 44;90 defining an aperture 48;92 to receive an ink

withdrawal needle 82 to enable the seal 44;90 to seal around the ink withdrawal needle
82. A cover 50;96 is provided to cover the said aperture 48;92 in the seal 44;90 and to

be pierced by the ink withdrawal needle 82. A protective guide 52 may be provided to
align the ink withdrawal needle 82 with the aperture 48 and to guide the ink withdrawal

needle 82 into the aperture 48.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ink cartridge.A known ink cartridge comprises an ink tank and an ink outlet port in the form of a
hollow tube intersecting the floor of the ink tank so as to protrude into the ink tank.
The ink tank is generally rectangular and has a lid. The ink tank is filled with a porous
member in the form of a sponge. The porous member is inserted into the ink tank with
the lid removed. Before insertion, the porous member is generally rectangular. Thus,
when inserted, the porous member is deformed and compressed by the ink supply port,
which protrudes into the tank. A metal mesh filter is affixed to the inner end of the ink
supply port. There is a porous member in the outlet port which acts as a wick so that,
when the cartridge in inserted into a printer, and the ink withdrawal needle of the
printer enters the ink supply port, the porous member in the ink supply port will deform
around the ink withdrawal member and wick ink towards it.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an ink cartridge comprising
an ink tank defined by a plurality of surfaces, an ink outlet aperture or group of outlet
apertures defined in one of said surfaces, the surface defining the said ink outlet
aperture or apertures being flat in the vicinity of the outlet aperture or apertures.Preferably a porous member is provided in the ink tank adjacent the ink outlet aperture
or apertures.By means of the invention, the porous member will fit snugly against the flat area of the
surface in which the ink outlet aperture or apertures are defined to ensure a good and
uninterrupted flow of ink stored in the porous member in the tank through the ink outlet
aperture or apertures.Preferably, the flat area is substantially centred on the outlet aperture or group of outlet
apertures.The surface defining the ink outlet aperture or apertures is preferably flat to where it
reaches at least one other surface and may be flat to where it reaches two or preferably 
three other surfaces or most preferably four other surfaces. Indeed, preferably the entire
surface defining the ink outlet aperture or groups of ink outlet apertures is flat.The surface defining the ink outlet aperture or group of ink outlet apertures may be any
suitable surface defining the ink tank but conveniently may be the floor. Preferably
then the flat area is horizontal.According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an ink cartridge having
an ink outlet aperture or group of ink outlet apertures defined therein, the inner end of
the or
