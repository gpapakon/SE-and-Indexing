Apparatus for the treatment of 
palmoplantar hyperhidroses by ionophoresis, 

comprising two containers filled with an 
electrically conductive liquid in which the user 

immerses his hands and in which are respectively 
immersed two steel electrodes which are 

respectively connected to the positive and 
negative poles of a current generator, and also a 

device enabling the strength of the current 
supplied by the generator to be adjusted in such a 

manner that, at the beginning of the treatment, 
the current is increased in a progressive manner 

and, at the end of the treatment, the current 
diminishes likewise in a progressive manner, which 

apparatus is characterised in that the device 
permitting adjustment of the strength of the 

current supplied by the generator comprises at 
least one optical fibre (4, 4') which conducts the 

ambient light and one end of which or the first 
end of which (5, 5') is immersed in one of the 

containers (1, 1') while the second end (50, 50') 
opposite the first cooperates with adjusting 

devices, the closure of the first end (5, 5') of 
the or one of the optical fibres (4, 4') enabling 

the user to control remotely the increase or the 
reduction of the current supplied by the generator  

 
(3) directly with one of his hands immersed in the 

liquid of one of the containers (1, 1') and 
without having to remove it. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the device permitting 

adjustment of the strength of the current supplied 
by the generator comprises at least two optical 

fibres (4, 4'), the manual closure of one of those 
fibres (4) or the first fibre controlling the 

increase in the strength of the current supplied 
by the generator (3), while the closure of the 

other fibre (4') or second fibre controls the 
reduction in the current strength. 
Apparatus according to either of Claims 1 
and 2, characterised in that the adjusting devices 

comprise a respective opto-electronic switch 
(6, 6') capable of controlling the closure of the 

respective adjustment circuits (a, a') comprising 
a supplementary current generator (7, 7') and also 

a central control unit (8). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that each of the opto-electronic 

switches (6, 6') comprises a photosensitive 
element (9, 9'), the base (12, 12') of which 

cooperates with the second end (50, 50') of the  
 

associated optical fibre (4, 4'), an amplifier 
(10, 10') capable of strongly amplifying the 

signal transmitted by the photosensitive element 
(9, 9'), and also a connector (11, 11'), the 

actuation of which by this signal enables the 
closure of the associated adjustment circuit 

(a, a') to be controlled. 
Apparatus according to either of Claims 3 
and 4, characterised in than the central control 

unit (8) comprises a voltage-charged capacitor 
(13) associated with an operational amplifier 

(15).
