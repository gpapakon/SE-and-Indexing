<DESCRIPTION>
Herbicides which demonstrate potent total 
vegetation control over a broad spectrum of annual and 
perennial weeds are of high interest in agricultural 
practice. The use of (+)-hydantocidin as a herbicide is 
described in US Patent 4,952,234. A process for the 
preparation of said compound is described in DE 
4,129,728. Two complimentary syntheses of (+)-hydantocidin 
are Mio, S.; Ichinose, R.; Goto, K.; Sugai, S. 
Tetrahedron 1991, 47,2111 and Mio, S.; Kumagawa, Y.; 
Sugai, S. Tetrahedron 1991, 47,2133. However, all of  
 
these processes are fundamentally similar and are not 
economically feasible. In general, many synthetic 
transformations are required, overall yields are low, 
and chemical selectivity is lacking. It is, therefore, an object of the present 
invention to provide a simple and efficient enantioselective 
process for the preparation of (+)-hydantocidin. It is another object of this invention to 
provide intermediate compounds useful in the preparation 
of hydantocidin and derivatives thereof. It is a further object of this invention to 
provide thiohydantocidin compounds which are useful as 
herbicidal agents. There is provided a process for the preparation 
of a compound of formula I 
wherein X is O or S and n is an integer of 1 or 2 which 
comprises hydrating a compound of formula II  wherein n is an integer of 1 or 2 and R is a protecting 
group in the presence of manganese dioxide and a solvent 
to form an intermediate compound of formula III 
brominating the formula III compound to form a second 
intermediate of formula IV 
reacting the second intermediate with silver cyanate or 
silver thiocyanate in the presence of an anhydrous 
non-protic solvent at a temperature of about 75°-150°C 
to form a third intermediate of formula V  wherein X is O or S and deprotecting the formula V 
intermediate in the presence of a base to obtain 
the desired compound of formula I. There are also provided intermediate compounds 
of formulas III, IV and V, useful in the preparation 
of hydantocidin. Further provided is an herbicidal compound 
having the structure 
wherein X₁ and X₂ are independently O or S provided at 
least one must be S, the optical isomers thereof and 
the diastereomers thereof. The present invention relates to an efficient 
and enantioselective preparation of the herbicidal 
natural product (+)-hydantocidin (D-ribose-1-spiro-5'-N1'-β-hydantoin), 
carbohydrate-based derivatives 
thereof and sulfur analogs thereof.  Advantageously, the inventive process employs 
commercially
