<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus includes an image processor 
for processing an original image in a desired manner, the 

image processor being provided with an original document 
holder for holding an original document, an image editing 

device for editing an original image on the basis of original 
image coordinates defined by the document holder, and a 

secondary original document producing device for automatically 
producing a secondary original document equal or 

smaller than the size of the original document holder when 
the original document is larger than the original document 

holder. This apparatus need not a number of original document 
holders of various sizes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image forming apparatus 
capable of producing a desired copy image by editing an 
image on an original document. In conventional image forming apparatus capable of 
editing an image on an original document to produce a desired 
copy image, an original document is placed on an 
editing pad, and coordinates defining an area to be edited 
are determined and the coordinates are entered into the 
image forming apparatus. In the case of copying an original image by masking or 
hiding a specified rectangular area of the original image, 
for example, an operator places the original document on an 
editing pad and determines coordinates of two opposite 
corners of a specified rectangular area. The operator 
enters the coordinates of the two corners into the image 
forming apparatus. The image forming apparatus produces a 
copy image with the specified rectangular area being masked. However, in such conventional image forming apparatus. 
it is necessary to use an editing pad having the same size 
as the original document. In the case of editing an image 
on an original document A0 size or largest standard size,  
 
for example, it is required to prepare an editing pad of A0 
size identical to the size of the original document. Also, 
a large space is necessary to store the largest editing pad 
of A0 size when not used. This is economically wasteful. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
image forming apparatus which has overcome the above-mentioned 
drawbacks. It is another object of the present invention to provide 
an image forming apparatus which makes it possible to 
edit and copy an image on a large original document without 
use of a large editing pad equal or larger than the original 
document. According to the present invention, an image forming 
apparatus comprises: image reading means for reading an 
image on an original document of a first size; image processor 
means for processing the read original image in a desired 
manner, the image processor means including: original 
document holding means for holding an original document, the 
original document holding means having a coordinate system 
for defining a specific position of the original document, 
and the original document holding means having a second 
size; image editing means for editing the read original 
image on the basis of positions defined by the coordinate  
 
system of the original document holding means; secondary 
original document producing means for producing a secondary 
original
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus comprising: 
image reading means (42-45) for reading an image on an original document 

of a first size; 
image processor means (3, 7) for processing the read original image in a 

desired manner, the image processor means including: 
   original document holding means (6) for holding an original document, 

the original document holding means having a coordinate system for 
defining a specific position of the original document, and the original 

document holding means having a second size; 
   image editing means (72) for editing the read original image on the 

basis of positions defined by the coordinate system of the original 
document holding means (6); 

   secondary original document producing means (72, 71, S5) for producing 
a secondary original document having a size equal or smaller than 

the second size and carrying a reduced original image, the reduced 
original image having the same reduction ratio as the secondary original 

document; and image forming means (40) for forming the processed 
original image on copy paper. 
An image forming apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein the image 
processor means further includes: 

   judging means (7, S8) für judging whether the first size is greater than 
the second 
size; and
