<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
manufacture of cyclic esters by the conversion of hydroxy
carboxylic acids, referred to herein as hydroxy acids or
hydroxy carboxylic acids, and their derivatives to their
respective cyclic esters, preferably cyclic compounds with
two esters in the same ring. The invention contemplates both
a liquid phase conversion and a vapor phase conversion of
hydroxy acids to their respective cyclic esters. This
invention also includes novel techniques for recovering the
cyclic esters.Cyclic esters, including cyclic esters of the general
formula
 
wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 can be either hydrogen or an
aliphatic or substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic or aryl
hydrocarbon having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, are a
useful class of compounds that can be polymerized into
polymeric materials. Such polymeric materials are
particularly useful in the preparation of biodegradable
plastic materials and plastic materials which dissolve when
used in medical applications. Polymers made from the
polymerization of such cyclic esters as lactide are
particularly useful because they can be degraded over time
by water hydrolysis under most environmental conditions.
The resulting lactic acid units or oligomers of lactic acid
are then readily taken up by organisms in the environment
and converted to carbon dioxide and water. Cyclic esters
are also useful as plasticizers and intermediates for
production of surface-active agents and plasticizers.In accordance with prior practice, the desired cyclic
esters were prepared by first condensing hydroxy acids,
typically α-hydroxy acids, to an oligomeric prepolymer of
relative high molecular weight. The prepolymer was then
depolymerized at high temperature and low pressure in a
heated, evacuated reactor to a crude cyclic ester. Extensive
purification processes were required to obtain cyclic esters
of requisite purity sufficient to provide polymers of desired
molecular weight.The production of a cyclic ester from an oligomeric α-hydroxy
acid prepolymer is sometimes referred to as a back-biting
reaction since it involves the gradual removal of α-hydroxy 
acid components from the tail ends of the polymer
to form the cyclic ester as illustrated below with reference
to a lactic acid polymer.
U.S. Patent No. 4,727,163 to Bellis is directed to a
process which includes first making a prepolymer comprising
a block polymer which includes a thermally stable polyether
core with an α-hydroxy acid or its ester polymerized onto
the core. Upon heating under
