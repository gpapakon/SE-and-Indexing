<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to silicone 
release coating compositions comprising (A) a mixture 

of (i) a dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane-methylphenyl-siloxane 
copolymer and (ii) a 

dimethylsiloxane- methylvinylsiloxane copolymer, (B) an 
organohydrogenpolysiloxane, (C) a platinum catalyst, 

and (D) an organic solvent. These silicone release 
coating compositions provide small release resistance 

values both at low and high peeling velocities and do 
not impair the residual adhesion of tacky substances 

that come into contact with the coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silicone
composition that cures to form a release coating. The
silicone composition of our invention provides the
surfaces of various types of substrates such as papers,
laminated papers, synthetic plastic films, and metal
foils with the ability to release tacky substances by
formation of a cured organopolysiloxane coating on the
substrate surface.Silicone compositions that cure to form
release coatings (silicone release compositions) are
applied to release liners for pressure-sensitive
adhesive tapes and sheets to form thereon a cured
coating that is capable of releasing tacky substances.
The release coatings used in such applications must
exhibit small release resistance values both at low
peel velocities (below approximately 0.3 m/minute) and
at high peel velocities (above approximately 50
m/minute). Japanese Patent Publication 2-187466
teaches an example of such a silicone release
composition. It consists of a platinum catalyst, an
organohydrogenpolysiloxane, and a diorganopolysiloxane
mixture composed of a dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane
copolymer and a
dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane-diphenylsiloxane
copolymer containing 0.5 to 3.0 mole
percent of mono or diphenylsiloxane units. This composition
gives high release resistance values in general and
also reduces the residual adhesion of tacky substances
brought into contact with its cured release coating.
Thus, depending on the application, its performance is
not always satisfactory.The present invention introduces a silicone
release composition which cures to form a release 
coating that exhibits small release resistance values
at both low and high peeling velocities.Our silicone release coating composition does
not impair the residual adhesion of tacky substances
that are brought into contact with its cured release
coating.The present invention is a silicone release
coating composition comprising: (A) 100 weight parts of
a mixture of: (i) 90.0 to 99.0 weight percent of a
polydiorganosiloxane having the general formula:

wherein R1 is independently selected from a hydroxyl
group, a vinyl group, a methyl group, and a phenyl
group, x, y, and z are positive integers such that
0.86 ≤ x/(x + y + z) < 0.94, 0.03 < y/(x + y + z) ≤
0.07, and 0.03 ≤ z/ (x + y + z) ≤ 0.07, and (ii) 1.0 to
10.0 weight percent of a polydiorganosiloxane having
the general formula:

wherein R2 is independently selected from a hydroxyl
group, a vinyl group, and a methyl group, p is a
positive integer and q represents 0 or a positive
