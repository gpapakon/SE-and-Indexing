<ABSTRACT>
A method of upsetting and flaring a thin-walled metal tubular probe with 
one closed end onto a non-metallic plate in a single tooling set-up. The closed 

end of the tubing probe is inserted in a hole in the plate and a mandrel inserted 
in the open end of the tube and spring biased to register against the interior of 

the closed end of the tube which has an anvil washer received thereover which 
supports the tube wall. A pilot tool is registered against the closed end of the 

tube; and, an annular tool is received over the mandrel and registers against the 
open end of the tube. With the annular tool supporting axially the open end of 

the tube, the pilot tool is moved against the closed end of the tube and bulges a 
portion of the tube in a recess provided in the plate or in the anvil washer 

against one side of the plate. The annular tool is then moved axially to flare the 
open end of the tube against the opposite side of the plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of tubular probe 
assemblies where it is desired to attach a thin walled metal tube having one 
exposed end thereof closed and the tube attached to a housing structure with 
one end open interiorly of the housing for insertion of desired electrical sensing 
articles into the tube. Tubular assemblies of this type are useful as sensing 
probes, and particularly, probes of the type employed for sensing temperature. 
The metal tube provides rapid heat conduction from the article or medium to be 
sensed; and, it is often desirable to mount the tubular probe to a non-metallic 
structure for housing associated electrical circuitry and connectors. Sensing 
probes of this type are often employed for sensing temperature where it is 
desired to provide a thermocouple in the closed end of the tube with the 
electrical leads of the thermocouple extending outwardly of the open end of the 
tube to the interior of the non-metallic housing structure upon which the tube is 
attached or carried. Heretofore, various techniques of attaching the thin-walled tubular metal 
probe to a non-metallic housing have included such expedients as potting with 
epoxy resin and forming a non-circular shape to the open end portion of the 
tube and clamping the non-circular portion with appropriate correspondingly 
shaped surfaces formed in the housing structure. Both of these techniques 
have proven to be unwieldy and costly for probes utilized in high volume mass 
produced applications such as, for example, temperature sensing probes utilized 
in automotive air conditioning systems. Thus, it has long been desired to 
provide a way or means of attaching a metal tube having one end closed to a 
non-metallic housing structure in a low-cost and convenient manner conducive 
to high volume manufacturing of the tubular assembly. The present invention provides a single station tooling arrangement for 
attaching a relatively thin-walled metal tube having one end closed to a non-metallic  
 
housing structure such as a plastic plate. The closed end of the tube is 
inserted through an aperture formed in the plate and an annular anvil washer is 
received over the closed end of the tube protruding through the plate on the 
exterior side thereof. A pilot tool is received in the anvil washer and registered 
against the closed end of the tube; and, a spring is employed for biasing the 
anvil against the exterior side of the plate. A mandrel is inserted into the open 
end of the tube from the interior side

A method of attaching a relatively thin walled metal tube with one end 
closed to a non-metallic plate comprising: 


(a) forming an aperture closely fitting the tube in the plate with an 
enlarged diameter on one side and inserting the closed end of the 

tube to protrude through the enlarged diameter; 
(b) surrounding the protruding end of the tube with an annular spacer 
closely interfitting the tube; 
(c) resiliently supporting the open end of the tube against axial 
movement on the side of the plate opposite the protruding closed 

tube end and inserting a mandrel in said tube and biasing the 
mandrel against the closed tube end; 
(d) externally contacting the protruding closed end of the tube with a 
tool and forcing the tube and said mandrel axially within said 

spacer and causing the tube to locally bulge in the enlarged 
diameter; and, 
(e) axially supporting the bulge in the tube with said spacer and the 
closed end of the tube with said tool and axially contacting the 

open end of said tube opposite said closed end and with another 
tool and flaring said open end against said aperture between said 

bulge and said flare. 
A method of attaching a relatively thin wall metal tubing having one end 
closed and the other end open to a non-metallic plate comprising: 


(a) forming an aperture through the plate and sizing the aperture to 
closely fit the tube; 
(b) inserting the closed end of the tube in the aperture from one side 
of the plate and extending the closed end beyond the opposite side 

of the plate; 
(c) contacting and supporting axially the closed end of the tube with a 
pilot tool; 
(d) inserting a mandrel in the open end of the tube and resiliently 
biasing the mandrel end axially against the closed end of the tube; 
(e) disposing another tool annularly about the mandrel and axially 
biasing same against the open end of the tube; 
(f) axially resiliently supporting said another tool and said mandrel and 
annularly supporting a portion of the tube extending beyond the 

plate; 
(g) moving said pilot tool toward said plate and causing the tube to 
bulge annularly against said opposite side of the plate; and, 
(h) axially supporting said bulge and said pilot tool and moving said 
another tool axially toward said plate and flaring the open end of 

the tube against said one side of the plate and securing the tube in 
said aperture with said bulge and flare; and, removing said tool and 

mandrel. 
A method of assembling a relatively thin wall metal tube having an open 
end and a closed end to a non-metallic plate comprising: 


(a) forming an aperture in the plate and inserting the closed end of the 
tube therethrough; 
(b) positioning and axially supporting with an annular tool the open 
end of the tube relative to the plate; 
(c) inserting a mandrel in the tube and supporting the closed end of 
the tube therewith;
