<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solid photosensitive 
elements which can be used to make flexographic 
printing plates. More particularly, it relates to 
aqueous developable photosensitive elements and to a 
process for preparing such elements. Photosensitive compositions useful in 
preparing flexographic printing plates are well known 
in the art. These compositions generally comprise (1) 
an addition polymerizable, non-gaseous, ethylenically 
unsaturated monomer or oligomer, (2) a photoinitiator 
or photoinitiating system activated by actinic 
radiation and (3) a thermoplastic elastomeric polymeric 
binder comprising polymerized conjugated diene 
monomers. Flexographic printing elements can be made 
from these photosensitive compositions by solvent 
casting, by extruding and calendering, or by pressing 
the compositions at an elevated temperature into the 
form of a layer or self-supporting sheet on a suitable 
casting wheel, belt or platen. The photosensitive 
sheet can be permanently affixed to a suitable 
permanent substrate. A removable coversheet is usually 
placed on top to protect the surface of the 
photosensitive sheet from contamination by dirt and 
dust particles during storage prior to use. Photopolymerizable elements and processes for 
their use in preparing flexographic printing plates are 
well known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent 
Nos. 4,323,636; 4,460,675; 4,970,037; and many others.  
 Flexographic printing plates can be made from the 
photosensitive elements described above, by exposing to 
actinic radiation selected portions of the 
photosensitive layer, usually through an image-bearing 
transparency. Upon exposure to actinic radiation, the 
ethylenically unsaturated monomer or oligomer is 
polymerized or crosslinked in those areas of the 
photosensitive layer exposed to actinic radiation, 
resulting in reduced solubility or swellability in 
developer solvents. No significant polymerization or 
crosslinking occurs in the unexposed areas of the 
photosensitive layer. Consequently, upon application 
of suitable developer solvent, the exposed areas 
remain, and the unexposed areas are removed. The developer solvents most commonly used are 
organic solvents including aromatic or aliphatic 
hydrocarbon or halohydrocarbon solvents. Recently, it 
has become less desirable to use such organic solvents 
due to toxicity and environmental concerns. Thus, 
photosensitive compositions which are aqueous 
developable, i.e., can be washed out with aqueous 
solutions or plain water, have been
