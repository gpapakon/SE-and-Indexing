<ABSTRACT>
Described is a sheet of labels made from label material consisting of non-sticky substrate material, an intermediate adhesive layer and top material, the surface area of the top material being smaller than that of the substrate to the extent that the edges of the substrate material project out on all sides of the sheet beyond the edges of the top material. A sheet of this kind avoids particles of adhesive from being transferred to parts of machines (e.g. an EDV printer) in an installation in which the sheets are further processed, irrespective of which side is used to draw the sheet into the processing installation. Also proposed are a method and a device for the production of sheets of labels, in which a roll of label material made up of non-sticky substrate material, an intermediate adhesive layer and top material is unrolled, optionally printed on and then cut by stamping, the regular matrix of top material between the labels is subsequently pulled off and finally the remaining label material is cut longitudinally and transversely and distributed as sheets or perforated across and folded and then torn into individual sheets along the perforation lines. The method calls for the regular matrix of top material between the labels to be pulled off at an angle of 5 DEG  to 90 DEG  to the direction of motion of the continuously moving web of label material, the outer longitudinal edges of the matrix being guided in such a way that they are free to move at right angles to the direction of motion of the matrix in the plane of the pulled-off matrix. This method enables labels to be manufactured at higher speeds (higher web speeds) without the matrix of top material tearing or manufacturing machine becoming dirty or stopping.

Label sheet made of a label material, consisting of
abhesive substrate material, pressure-sensitive adhesive

layer in between and upper material, the surface area of
the upper material being so much less than that of the

substrate material that the edge of the substrate
material protrudes beyond the edge of the upper material

on all sides of the sheet, characterised in that the
distance between edge of substrate material and edge of

upper material is 0.1 to 2.0 mm.
Label sheet according to claim 1, characterised in
that the distance between edge of substrate material and

edge of upper material is 0.2 to 1.0 mm.
Label sheet according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that it is rectangular.
Label sheet according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the surface of the

substrate material and/or the surface of the upper
material is printed, coated, cut, punched and/or

perforated.
Label sheet according to claim 4, characterised in
that the surface of the upper material is divided into

individual partial surfaces.
Label sheet according to claim 5, characterised in
that individual partial surfaces of the upper material

are stripped.
Label sheet according to claim 5, characterised in
that the upper material is stripped between individual

partial surfaces. 
Label sheet according to claim 5, characterised in
that the partial surface is triangular, rectangular,

square, polygonal, round or oval.
Label sheet according to claim 8, characterised in
that the rectangular or square partial surfaces have

rectangular, uniformly polygonal or round corners.
Label sheet according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the surface area of the

substrate material is DIN A0 to DIN A6.
Use of the label sheet according to one or more of
the preceding claims 1 to 10 for printing in computer

printers.
Use of the label sheet according to one or more of
the preceding claims 1 to 10 for copying in copiers.
Method for the manufacture of label sheets according
to any of claims 1 to 10, in which a label material

constructed from abhesive substrate material, pressuresensitive
adhesive layer in between and upper material is

unrolled, if necessary printed and then punched, then a
matrix grid strip of the upper material is stripped, and

lastly the remaining label material is cut longitudinally
and transversely or perforated transversely and deposited

or unfolded as sheets and then separated into individual
sheets at the perforation lines, wherein the matrix grid

strip is stripped from the upper material at an angle
alpha = 5-90째 to the direction of web travel of the label

material which is guided further and in the process the
outer longitudinal webs of the matrix grid strip are

guided in such a way that they are freely movable 
perpendicularly to the direction of travel of the matrix
