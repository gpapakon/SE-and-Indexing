<ABSTRACT>
Machine for wrapping and folding over edges for box making, comprising means for individually wrapping cardboard boxes with a covering sheet made from paper or from fabric and for folding over the free edges of the covering sheet totally or partially on the corresponding inner walls of the box, or the said covering and folding-over means are slaved to a programmable central unit with microprocessors (E) so as to permit automatic management and adjustment, according to the program, of intervention modes, in relation to the type of production it is desired to carry out from one stage to the next.

Covering and edging machine for box factories, comprising: 
a horizontal mould (4) connected to the free end of a rod (7) 

with vertical travel in order to position the box to be 
covered with the relevant sheet opposite the brush means 

(8,9,10,11,12) designed to apply the covering to the box by 
the relative movement of the box between the covering sheet 

and the said brushes (8,9,10,11,12); a number of lateral 
operating heads (T) which serve to support the said brushes 

and subjacent to the said rod (87) and which can be caused to 
perform an alternating horizontal movement from and towards 

the axis of the said rod (7) to enable the covering sheet to 
press on the outer walls of the box; an "upper mould element" 

(15) which can be caused to perform an alternating vertical 
movement from and towards the zone of action of the said 

lateral operating heads (T) and which is situated above the 
said mould (4) in order to enable the free edges of the 

covering to be wholly or partly turned over onto the corresponding 
inner walls of the box, the said "upper mould element" (15) first 

being introduced into the interior of the box; means for moving 
the said mould supporting rod (7); means (C) with two mechanical 

arms (3) which can be caused to perform an alternating horizontal 
movement from and towards the zone of action of the said operating 

heads (T), in order to feed the boxes to be covered into position 
and discharge them once they have been covered; 
characterized in 
that
 the said moulds (4), the said brushes (8,9,10,11,12) with  
 

the respective operating heads (T) and the said "upper mould" 
(15) are situated in one and the same position; that the said 

means for moving the mould supporting rod (7), the said means 
for moving the said lateral operating heads (T) and the said 

means (C) for feeding the boxes to be covered into position 
and for discharging them once they have been covered,are 

controllable by a central microprocessing unit (E), programmable 
to enable it to be activated and controlled separately, i.e. 

along a number of independent activation and control lines 
(L1,L2,L3), and to provide the possibility of independent 

adjustment of the respective modes of control with regard to 
the type of production to be effected, the said "upper mould 

element" engaging the box after it has been introduced into it, 
in order to place it in an upper discharge position, and that 

the said "upper mould element" has associated means with a 
number of rods (21) for the extraction of the box which has 

been covered. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
said means for moving the mould supporting rod (7) include a 

first electric motor (M1) of the electronically controlled 
brushless type associated with a corresponding absolute 

differential encoder (E1) and that it is provided with a 
tachymetric dynamo (D1) for controlling the position of the 

respective axis, and that the said motor (M1) can be subjected 
to the computer (E) and connected to the mould supporting rod (7) 

by a belt transmission system (22), for its movement, even of the 
intermittent type, with programmed control, with regard to the 

type of box and relevant covering sheet.
