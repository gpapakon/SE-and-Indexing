<CLAIMS>
A wiper arm including an arm head (1) to swivellably 
articulate it to a connecting head of a wiper drive of an 

automotive vehicle, and a wiper rod (13) retained at the arm 
head, the arm head (1) having a substantially U-shaped 

cross-section,
characterized
 in that the arm head (1) is bent 
such that the cross bar (4) of the arm head end (3), close to 

the wiper rod, extends in relation to the arm head end (2), 
close to the connecting head, in a way inclined by an acute 

angle (8). 
A wiper arm as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the bending angle of the 
arm head (1) amounts to 15° approximately. 
A wiper arm as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized
 in that the lateral distance of 
the lateral legs (10, 11) of the arm head (1) at the end 

close to the wiper rod is less than the lateral distance of 
the lateral legs (14, 15) at the end close to the connecting 

head. 
A wiper arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that, at the end of the arm 
head (1) close to the wiper rod, the two lateral legs are 

deflected in relation to one another in order to enclose and 
retain the associated wiper rod end at least in part.  

 
A wiper arm as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the end (3) of the arm 
head (1) close to the wiper rod embraces from above the 

surface of the wiper rod end (13), which is averted from the 
windshield in the position of use and has a C-shaped or 

roughly O-shaped cross-section, the lateral legs (10, 11) of 
the loose arm head (1) at the end (2) close to the connecting 

head, preferably, being about twice as long as they are at 
the arm head end (3) close to the wiper rod. 
A wiper arm as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5,
characterized
 in that each of the lateral legs 
(10, 11) at the wiper-rod-side frontal edge (20) of the arm 

head (1), prior to the deflection, enclose with the cross bar 
(4) an identical angle (18, 19) of, preferably, somewhat more 

than 90°. 
A wiper arm as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5,
characterized
 in that the lateral legs (10, 11) 
at the wiper-rod-side frontal edge (20) of the arm head (1), 

prior to the deflection, extend in parallel to the lateral 
legs (14, 15) at the end (2) close to the connecting head, 

and the lateral legs (14, 15) close to the connecting head 
are arranged roughly at right angles relative to its cross 

bar (5). 
A wiper arm as claimed in at least one of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that the planes of the frontal 
edge (20) close to the wiper rod and the frontal edge close 

to the connecting head or, respectively, a cross-section (21)  
 

of the arm head (1) close to the connecting head are arranged 
roughly in parallel to one another, the frontal edge close to 

the connecting head or, respectively, the cross-section (21) 
extending in an imaginary Y-Z plane, and in that, when viewed 

perpendicular to this Y-Z plane, the corner portion (35), 
which is higher in practical application, of the frontal edge 

(20) close to the wiper rod extends approximately flush with 
the cross bar (5) of the end close to the connecting head. 
A wiper arm as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that the two lateral legs (10, 
11) of the two frontal edges (20, 21) of the arm head (1) are 

arranged roughly mirror-invertedly relative to an imaginary 
X-Z plane. 
A wiper arm as claimed in claim 8 or claim 9,
characterized
 in that a mounting lug (24, 25) 
at the connecting-head-side end (2) of each side flank (22, 

23) of the arm head (1) on the top ends approximately flush 
with the upper wall (34) of the arm head (1).
