A bottle carrier made of a one-piece blank (31) of foldable flat material, such as cardboard, which can be placed around a group of bottles (33) in the manner of a sleeve, having a bottom wall (1), side walls (2, 3) linked to the longitudinal sides of the bottom wall, a fitted-together top wall made of inner and outer top-wall sections (6, 7) which are linked to the upper longitudinal sides of the side walls and bonded together in an overlapping region, and end walls made of end flaps (17, 18, 19, 24, 25, 28) which are linked to the transverse sides of the bottom wall, side walls and top wall, can be pivoted into the openings between them and bonded together in overlapping regions, the top wall having two gripping openings (8, 9, 10, 11) which are spaced apart in the transverse direction, the overlapping region of the outer and inner top-wall section (6, 7) forming a gripping section between the gripping openings for gripping through the gripping openings and being of three-ply design in the gripping section by means of a gripping reinforcement tab (12) which is folded from the longitudinal side of the inner top-wall section (7) opposite its attachment to the side wall (3) against the inside thereof, the bottom-wall end flaps (17) being connected via corner connecting tabs (20, 21) to side-wall end flaps (18, 19) folded against the inner sides of the side walls (2, 3), the top-wall end flaps (28) being extended over the entire transverse sides of the outer top-wall section (6) which is congruent with the top wall, and the top-wall end flaps being bonded to the outer sides of the bottom-wall end flaps (17) by means of connecting sections (29) at the height of the body of the bottles (33).
