<ABSTRACT>
A method for simultaneously programming a plurality of antifuses each having 
a first electrode connected to a common node and each having a second electrode 

connected to an isolated node electrically isolated from the nodes of each of the 
other antifuses includes the steps of precharging the common node and the 

isolated nodes to an intermediate voltage potential selected to minimize the stress 
on all antifuses; precharging the isolated nodes of selected ones of the antifuses to 

a first programming voltage potential placing a second programming voltage 
potential on said common node, the first and second programming voltage 

potentials selected such that the difference between them is sufficient to cause 
programming of said antifuses and such that said intermediate potential is 

substantially centered between them, waiting a predetermined amount of time; and 
measuring the current flowing between the common node isolated nodes. If the 

measured current indicates that the desired antifuse has not been programmed the 
programming process may be attempted a preselected number of times. After the 

selected antifuses have been programmed, they are individually soaked by 
passing a soaking current through them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to user-programmable circuit technology. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to antifuse technology and to methods for 
simultaneously programming a plurality of antifuses in a user-programmable circuit 
containing an array of antifuses. Antifuse structures, user-programmable integrated circuit architectures, and 
circuits and methods for programming antifuses in a user-programmable integrated 
circuit are known in the prior art. United States Patents Nos. 4,823,181, 4,758,745, 
and 5,070,384 disclose illustrative antifuse structures, programming circuits and 
circuit architectures employing antifuses. United States Patents Nos. 5,126,282 
and 5,130,777 disclose illustrative methods for programming antifuses in user-programmable 
integrated circuit structures. Basically, an antifuse may be programmed by placing a programming potential,  
 
usually referred to as Vpp, across it to disrupt the antifuse material disposed 
between its two conductive electrodes and to thereby form a conductive low-resistance 
path between the two electrodes. Typical antifuse programming may be 
viewed as comprising two cycles. During a first portion of a programming cycle, 
often referred to as a rupture" cycle, the antifuse material is initially disrupted to 
form a conductive path. After the antifuse material has been ruptured, a second 
portion of a programming cycle, often referred to as a "soak" cycle, current is 
allowed to flow through the ruptured antifuse material to lower the final resistance 
of the programmed antifuse. After the antifuse ruptures, current flows until both 
sides of the antifuse are at equal potential. This current can be very large since its 
amplitude is only limited by the small parasitic resistance of the circuit layout and 
the intrinsic antifuse resistance. A high current causes a large amount of instantaneous power to be dissipated 
by the antifuse structure. Therefore, the energy available for an instantaneous 
discharge must be limited to a level low enough to prevent antifuse contacts and 
vias from being damaged, or circuit structures associated with the programming 
path from being melted. The amount of instantaneous" energy that can be 
delivered by this current spike is limited by the effective capacitance in the 
discharge loop. In some interconnect architectures employing antifuses, large numbers of 
"cross antifuses", i.e., antifuses disposed at the intersections of conductors running 
in horizontal and vertical directions, are connected
