<ABSTRACT>
A container includes a receptacle portion and a lid, butt 
ends thereof being hingeably connected one to the other; 

one or more resiliently mounted teeth are formed which 
extend upwardly from a forward end of the receptacle 

portion, and which include a body portion with a recess 
extending therethrough; a plurality of laterally spaced 

apart protrusions are provided and extend inwardly from a 
forward end of the lid, such that on the lid being hinged 

over the receptacle portion, the protrusions contact and 
move over the resiliently mounted teeth, so as to releasably 

engage within the recesses and so as to releasably lock the 
receptacle portion and lid together. Recess means are 

provided and extend through an upper surface of the lid, 
adjacent a front face thereof, so as to allow for the 

insertion of release means therethrough and between said one 
or more teeth and a forward end of said lid, so as to allow 

for disengagement between said one or more teeth and said 
one or more protrusions and subsequent release of said lid 

from said receptacle portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to an improved container and in 
particular to a container for use 
as a security container. In this day and age containers are used for a number of purposes 
and in particular are used in connection with the sale and 
renting of video tapes, compact discs, computer games and the 
like. Such products are often placed in security containers for 
display, wherein the security containers carrying some form of 
coding or bar code, so that if the containers are removed from a 
premises without authority, monitoring means will actuate 
appropriate alarms. For example, in premises where videos, 
tapes, compact discs, video games and the like are hired out, 
the games are placed in containers, such as clear plastic 
containers, and are placed on shelves. These are then viewed by 
customers and a choice made. Normally the containers are 
security coded or have some bar code associated therewith for 
security purposes. Once a choice is made, the container enclosing the chosen video, 
disc, video game or the like is taken to the counter and the 
appropriate money paid. An attendant or assistant at the 
counter will then remove the video, tape, video game or the like 
from the container, thereafter handing the chosen article to the 
purchaser, so that the purchaser can leave the store. Clearly, 
if the purchaser attempts to leave the store with the video, 
tape, disc or video game retained in the container, alarms and 
the like will be actuated. Reference to the hiring of video tapes, discs, video games and 
the like is by way of example only. It should be appreciated 
that containers can be used in many areas, such as for the  
 
display of any desired goods for hire, sale or the like. They 
can be used in department stores, retail stores, wholesale 
outlets or the like. It will however be appreciated that it is important that 
containers which display such goods are in essence security 
containers which cannot be easily opened so that the goods 
displayed therein or contained therein can be removed. Various 
forms of security container have been suggested and are known. 
However, these are often difficult and time consuming to 
manufacture and effectively to use. It is an object of this invention to go at least 
some way towards overcoming or at least minimising problems 
associated with such security containers up until this time. It is a further object of this invention to 
provide a straightforward and efficient security container. It is a further object of the present invention to
