<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and a related method for generating a second harmonic 
frequency optical output from a fundamental frequency input beam, 

without significant 
birefringence. The apparatus includes two Type II doubler crystals 

(10,12) of equal length 
arranged with their corresponding axes parallel to each other, 

and a polarization rotator (14) 
positioned between the doubler crystals, to rotate the polarization 

angle of a residual 
fundamental frequency component of an output beam from one of 

the crystals by 90째 or 
an odd multiple of 90째. Random birefringence introduced into 

one of the doubler crystals 

is virtually canceled in the other, and the assembly of the 
two crystals and the 

polarization rotator may be angularly adjusted as needed for 
phase matching or tuning, 

without detracting from the birefringence compensation capability. 
The invention is also 

disclosed in the context of a phase conjugated master oscillator 
power amplifier (PC MOPA) system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical frequency multiplying devices
and, more particularly, to frequency doubling devices known as Type II doublers.
Frequency doubling devices take advantage of optical properties of some types of
crystals. specifically a property relating to indices of refraction measured along different
axes. The crystals used in doublers are anisotropic, meaning that their optical properties
are not the same in all directions. The index of refraction is dependent both on the
direction in which the index is measured and on the frequency or wavelength of the
light. In a type I crystal, the index along one axis, as measured for a fundamental
frequency of operation, matches the index along another axis, as measured for a second
harmonic frequency. When a light beam polarized in one plane and at the fundamental
frequency is input to the crystal at an appropriate angle, a second-harmonic output beam.
polarized in an orthogonal plane, is produced. Typically, the angle of the crystal with
respect to the input beam has to be adjusted to tune or phase-match the device to provide
a near-exact index match to the second harmonic output beam.Type II doublers operate on a slightly different principle. An input beam
is split by the crystal into two orthogonal components which are, in effect, frequency
summed in the crystal to produce a double frequency output beam. Type II doublers are
generally preferred because they are more efficient. The Type II crystal may also need
to be tilted to tune the device to provide the desired output. An important difference
between the two types of doublers is that Type I doublers do not change the polarization
of the input beam, but a simple Type II doubler acts as a random waveplate and converts
the input beam into an elliptically polarized beam. Moreover, tilting the crystal for any
reason, such as to optimize phase matching, will change the ellipticity of the beam
polarization.An important application of doublers is in phase conjugated master 
oscillator power amplifiers (PC MOPAs), to provide visible light
output from such devices. Phase conjugated frequency doubling
requires that the doubler be placed within the PC MOPA, and
aberrations caused by the doubler are then cancelled in a second
pass through the doubler, after phase conjugation. Type I
doublers have been used in this type of configuration. Type II
doublers, however, which inherently introduce some birefringence
(as much as 50% for circular polarization), are not ideally
suited to PC MOPA
