<ABSTRACT>
A bordering tool for connecting a plurality of sheets or film bundles by bordering allows the outer edge of the metal sheet to be set upright, then to be tilted over and finally folded over, i.e. the bordering operation can be completed in just one single working step. For this purpose, a bordering jaw is provided on the underside of a top part of the tool and, as the said top part is lowered, it comes to rest on the bottom part of the tool in the region of the die, which raises the outer edge of the metal sheet. The bottom part of the tool is divided into two in such a way that a relative motion between the two parts is brought about with the aid of the blank holder of the top part of the tool, which blank holder strikes the metal sheet, and this relative motion is intended, on the one hand, to raise the outer edge of the metal sheet and then to fold the outer edge over completely, whereupon the second part of the bottom part of the tool in turn executes a relative motion relative to the first part, which has already come to a standstill following its downward movement.

<CLAIMS>
A flanging tool, especially for joining a metal sheet to a multi-layer foil stack
by flanging the outer edge of the metal sheet on to the foil stack, and comprising


a top plate (1),
a top part (2) of a tool acted upon by the top plate so as to transmit pressure and
comprising a clamp (3) for holding down the material (13) for working, and
a bottom part (5) of the tool supporting the material (13) on its top surface and
comprising a bottom die and a baseplate (6) and a flanging jaw (4) extending

downwards from the underside of the top part (2) of the tool, wherein the bottom
part (5) of the tool is divided so that after the clamp (3) strikes the material (13),

the first part (5a) supporting the material (13) moves in the direction of the
baseplate (6) relative to the second part (5b) supporting the edge region of the

material (13) until it strikes a stop (8),
characterised in that
the flanging jaw (4), during motion of the top part (2) of the tool relative to the
bottom part (5) of the tool, comes to rest on that region of the bottom die which

bends the outer edge of the metal sheet upright; that
after the clamp (3) strikes the stop (8) the second part (5b), after the flanging jaw
(4) strikes, moves relative to the first part (5a) in the direction of the baseplate (6),

and that
the flanging jaw (4) is so shaped that during the relative motion of the second part
(5b) it first presses against and then closes the bent-up outer edge (13a) of the

metal sheet.
A flanging tool according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the clamp (3) is
secured to the upper part (2) of the tool via at least one guide bolt (9) and at least

one pressure spring (10) in such a way that it, together with the top part (2) of the
tool, is movable in the direction towards the baseplate (6) until it rests on the

material (13) and the first part (5a) of the bottom part (5) of the tool has struck the
abutment (8), and the tool upper part (2) is movable relative to the clamp (3) in the

direction towards the baseplate (6) after the first part (5a) has struck the stop (8).
A flanging tool according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the first and the
second part (5a, 5b) are secured to the bottom part (5) of the tool via at least one

guide bolt (11) and at least one pressure spring (12) in such a way that firstly the
first part (5a) is movable relative to the second part (5b) and then the second part

(5b) is movable relative to the first part (5a) in the direction of the baseplate (6).
