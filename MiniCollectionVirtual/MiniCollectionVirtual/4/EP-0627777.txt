<ABSTRACT>
A non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary battery including 
an anode (1) formed of a carbon material capable of dope and undope 

of lithium, a cathode (2) formed of a lithium-containing transition 
metal composite oxide and a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte (3) is 

disclosed. The carbon material for the anode contains graphite 
and a non-graphitic carbon material formed of at least a non-graphitizable 

carbon material or a graphitizable carbon material. 
The non-graphitic carbon material preferably exhibits a discharge 

capacity per gram 80% or more of that of the graphite, measured 
in the first cycle of intermittent charging and discharging. The 

non-graphitic carbon material exhibits a ratio of a discharge 

capacity up to 0.3 V to a discharge capacity up to 1.5 V which 
is not smaller than 0.5, measured in the first cycle of 

intermittent charging and discharging with a standard of a 
lithium potential. Specifically, the graphite has a true density 

of 2.1 g/cm³ or greater, an interplanar distance of (002) of less 
than 0.340 nm found by X-ray diffraction, and a C-axis 

crystallite size of the (002) plane of 14.0 nm or greater. The 
non-graphitic carbon material has a true density of 1.70 g/cm³ or 

smaller, an interplanar distance of (002) plane of 0.37 nm or 
greater, and an exothermic peak observed at temperatures except 

700°C and higher temperatures in differential thermal analysis 
in an air stream. The non-aqueous liquid electrolyte is a liquid 

electrolyte formed by dissolving an electrolyte into a non-aqueous 
solvent containing ethylene carbonate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte
secondary battery using a carbon material for its anode.As technologies in electronics have been remarkably evolved,
a variety of electronic equipment has become smaller and lighter.
Accordingly, it has been required that batteries as portable
power sources be increasingly smaller, lighter, and higher in
energy density.Conventionally, aqueous solution type secondary batteries,
such as lead batteries and nickel-cadmium batteries, are
primarily used as secondary batteries for general use. However,
though these aqueous solution type secondary batteries exhibit
excellent cyclic properties, they are not satisfactory in weight
and energy density.Meanwhile, recently, a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte
secondary battery using lithium or a lithium alloy for its anode
has been researched and developed prevalently. This non-aqueous
liquid electrolyte secondary battery has a high energy density,
exhibits only a small amount of self-discharge, and is
lightweight.However, in this non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary
battery, there is a high possibility that lithium is crystallized
in dendritic form on the anode when the battery is charged in 
proceedings of charge/discharge cycles, and that the crystallized
lithium finally reaches the cathode to generate an internal short
circuit. Therefore, it is difficult to employ this non-aqueous
liquid electrolyte secondary battery for practical use.Thus, a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary battery
using a carbon material for its anode has been proposed. This
non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary battery utilizes doping
and releasing lithium into and from between carbon layers of the
carbon material. By doing so, the battery does not exhibit such
a phenomenon that dendritic lithium precipitates on the anode
even though charge/discharge cycles proceed. The battery has a
high energy density, and is lightweight as well as satisfactory
in charge/discharge cyclic property.Meanwhile, among various carbon materials usable for the
anode of such a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary battery,
the first one that was practically used for the anode is cokes
or a non-graphitizable carbon material, such as glass like
carbon, that is, a carbon material of low crystalline property
formed by heat-treating an organic material at a relatively low
temperature. A non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary battery
which has the anode formed of cokes or the non-graphitizable
carbon material and a liquid electrolyte using
