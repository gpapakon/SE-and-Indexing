<ABSTRACT>
A quantitative method for determining the plasma levels of thrombin-specific inhibitors is based on the quantitative thrombin time using plasma dilutions, excess fibrinogen and thrombin. The plasma dilutions and excess fibrinogen act in concert to eliminate the effects that coagulopathies have on standard coagulation tests. The method is relatively simple and provides superior results to standard conventional tests. The method is suitable for performance in clinical hematology laboratories on a routine basis using commercially available instrumentation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: TEST FOR QUANTITATIVE THROMBIN TIMEField of the invention:This invention relates to laboratory testing useful in monitoring of anticoagulant therapy. More specifically, this ' invention relates to assays for the anticoagulants that are known to inhibit the enzyme thrombin.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Presently, thro bin-specific inhibitors are in clinical trials as anticoagulant drugs for the treatment of arterial (after coronary artery angioplasty) and deep venous thrombosis. The specificity of these drugs is reflected in the dissociation constants ranging from 2 picomoles/L - 2 nanomoles/L. The thrombin specific inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in animal models for both treatment and prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis. Recombinant hirudin, derived from the medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis. is the thrombin-specific inhibitor most studied. Effective doses and their range for therapeutic plasma levels in humans have been determined. The low and high ends of the range are used for venous and arterial thrombosis, respectively.Several U.S. patents have been issued on anti-thrombin agents for use as medicinals or bound to implantable materials. U.S. Patent 4,944,943 to Eschenfelder, et al. teaches use of hirudin and t-PA for treatment of thrombosis. U.S. Patent 4,952,562 to Klein, et al, discloses anti-thrombotic peptides and pseudopeptides. U.S. Patent 5,019,393 to Ito, et al. teaches use of implantable materials having a thrombogenesis inhibitor immobilized thereon. U.S. patent 5,053,453 to Ku discloses hirudin or hirudin derivatives covalently linked to support materials to avoid formation of thrombi. U.S. Patent 5,640,814 to Klein, et al. discloses an anti-thrombotic peptide for administration as a medicinal. U.S. Patent 5,087,613 to Courtney, et al. discloses hirudin variants for use as inhibi- tors of thrombin activity. U.S. Patent 5,095,092 discloses a process for isolation and purification of hirudin. None of the cited patents disclose a quantitative thrombin-time test as 

taught herein.Several methods are presently used to assess whether the patient taking the new thrombin-specific inhibitors is therapeutically anticoagulated. It is possible to measure plasma thrombin-specific inhibitors levels by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) . Though accurate, HPLC is generally available only in large referral hospitals and commercial labs and requires a high level of staff expertise. Even when available in large referral hospitals, the technique is time consuming. Hence,
