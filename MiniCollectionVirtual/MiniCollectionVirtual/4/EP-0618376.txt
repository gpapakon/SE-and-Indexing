<ABSTRACT>
A self-drilling anchor (24) installable in a wall by means of a 
screwdriver, the anchor (24) being adapted to receive a fastener (34) 

serving to hold a fixture (33) adjacent the wall. The anchor (24) 
includes an externally-threaded shank section (25) having a head (26) 

engageable by the screwdriver and a longitudinal bore (28) to receive 
the fastener (34). Integral with the shank section (25) and extending 

axially therefrom is a core drill section (31) whose bit includes at 
least one cutting blade (T1) and whose outer cylindrical surface acts as 

guide means whereby as the anchor (24) is turned in to the wall by a 
screwdriver, the cutting blade then bores a round hole therein whose 

bank is engaged by the cylindrical surface to ensure circularity of the 
drilled hole. And as the anchor (24) continues to turn, the shank 

section (25) enters and taps the drilled hole until its head (26) 
engages the outer surface of the wall to complete the anchor 

installation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an anchor 
which when installed in a hole drilled in a wall is 
adapted to receive a threaded fastener that serves to 
hold a fixture or other object against the wall, and 
more particularly to a self-drilling anchor of this 
type which dispenses with the need for any tool other 
than a screwdriver to install the anchor and which is 
usable with fasteners of different length. In order to mount brackets, fixtures and other 
objects provided with mounting holes against the outer 
surface of a wall formed of plasterboard, sheetrock, 
fiberboard or any other material employed in hollow 
wall construction, the common practice is to use a 
hollow wall anchor for this purpose. The conventional 
hollow wall anchor formed of metal or plastic, when 
hammered into and wedged within a hole pre-drilled in 
the wall, is then adapted to receive a threaded 
fastener or mounting screw that goes through the 
mounting hole in the fixture and turns into the hollow 
of the anchor.  The required length of the mounting screw depends 
on the thickness of the fixture or object to be 
supported against the wall. Thus if the object is a 
thin metal bracket, a screw of smaller length is 
required than if the object is a thick plate or board, 
for this dictates a longer screw. The installation of a conventional anchor entails 
three distinct operations, the first and most critical 
step being drilling a hole in the wall, for the 
diameter of this hole must be appropriate to that of 
the anchor. Should an oversize hole be drilled, then 
in the next step when the anchor is hammered into the 
hole, the anchor may well not wedge firmly therein but 
will be somewhat loose. As a consequence, it will be 
difficult to carry out the third step. In the third step, one must turn a threaded 
fastener into the hollow of the anchor, and in doing 
so tap the anchor. But if the anchor is somewhat 
loose in the wall hole, this will cause the anchor to 
turn as the fastener is turned, and the fastener will 
therefore not be able to thread its way into the 
anchor. There is also a possible fourth step that must be 
taken into account; for should a need arise to remove 
an object mounted on the wall or replace it with 
another object, then one must first unscrew the  
 
fastener from the anchor lodged in the wall. However, 
if when an unscrewing torque is applied to the 
fastener, this torque causes the anchor as well as the 
fastener to turn, then it will not be possible to 
withdraw the fastener from the anchor.

<CLAIMS>
A self-drilling anchor installable in a wall by 
means of a torque-producing tool, said anchor 

comprising; 

(a) an externally-threaded shank section adapted to 
receive the tool for turning the anchor into the wall, 

the shank having a longitudinal bore for receiving a 
fastener to hold an object; and 
(b) a core drill section integral with the shank 
section and extending axially therefrom to drill a hole 

in the wall which is tapped by the shank section to 
secure the anchor to the wall, the core drill section 

having a longitudinal bore generally aligned with the 
bore of the shank section. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 1, in which the 
drill section includes a bit defined by at least one 

cutting tooth. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 1, in which the 
drill section has an arcuate exterior surface which acts 

as a guide to ensure the circularity of the hole drilled 
thereby. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 1, in which the core 
drill section is formed by a hollow cylinder whose 

 
exterior surface acts as a guide to ensure the 

circularity of the hole drilled thereby. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 4, in which the 
length of the cylinder is such that when the anchor is 

turned into the wall to cause the drill section to drill 
a hole therein, the shank section then enters and taps 

this hole. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 2, in which the 
drill section is provided with a bit defined by a pair 

of opposed teeth cut. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 6, in which the 
teeth each have a triangular configuration whose tips 

define cutting edges. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 1, in which the 
shank has a head in a truncated form whose undersurface 

is provided with an array of teeth, which, when engaged 
with the wall in which the anchor is installed, act to 

resist turning out of the anchor. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 1, in which the 
longitudinal bore in the shank section has a cruciform 

cross section to define ridges which are tapped by a 
 

screw-type fastener. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 4, in which the 
shank section has a tapered root which is integral with 

the cylinder of the drill section whose diameter is 
substantially equal to that of the root at its junction 

with the cylinder. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 1, molded of 
synthetic, plastic material of high strength. 
An anchor as set forth in claim 11, in which the 
material is nylon.
