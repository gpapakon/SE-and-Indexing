<ABSTRACT>
Cyan dye density can be maximized in color
developed silver halide photographic color materials

and bleaching accelerated by contacting the materials
with a bleaching or bleach-fixing composition

comprising a ferric complex of an aminopolycarboxylic
acid as a bleaching agent, and an aromatic pyridinyl

mono- or dicarboxylic acid in uncomplexed form. The
molar ratio of the aromatic carboxylic acid to the

ferric ion in the bleaching agent is from 0.02:1 to
0.8:1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
photographic bleaching or bleach-fixing composition
comprising ferric aminopolycarboxylic acids. It also
relates to a method of bleaching or bleach-fixing in
which the recovery of cyan dye density is accelerated.During processing of silver halide color
photographic elements, the developed silver is oxidized
to a silver salt by a suitable bleaching agent. The
oxidized silver is then removed from the element in a
"fixing" step. In some processes, the two steps can be
combined in a so-called bleach-fix step.Common bleaching agents include ferric
chelate complexes of aminopolycarboxylate ligands, such
as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1,3-propylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (PDTA). These agents
perform acceptably, but are not generally
biodegradable, and environmental concerns are very
prominent in many cultures. Other ligands have become
acceptable for providing both bleaching and
biodegradability, including β-alaninediacetic acid
(ADA), ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) and
methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA).These biodegradable bleaching agents may have
one or more deficiencies, most notably a lower
bleaching rate than the EDTA complexes. Thus, ferric
complexes of ADA are well known, but they are
relatively slow bleaching agents compared to the
ferric-EDTA complexes. Thus, they must be used in
higher concentrations which is undesirable for cost and
environmental reasons. Japanese Kokai 51-07930 describes the use of
nitrilotriacetic acid or 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid
or both to reduce stains in neutralizing or fixing
solutions. Bleaching solutions containing an
aminocarboxylic acid metal complex salt or a
polycarboxylic acid metal complex salt are also known.
Japanese Kokai 53-048529 describes the use of such
complexes to lower fog.EP-A-0 329 088 describes bidentate complexes
in bleaching solutions which further contain buffers,
one of which is 2-pyridinecarboxylic acid (PCA).
Complexes of PCA with iron are not described.A ferric complex of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic
acid (PDCA) is described in US-A-5,460,924. Useful
ternary bleaching agents are described in EP
Application 94/202787.1. Such materials comprise one
iron atom and two different ligands.Japanese Kokai 50-26542 describes bleaching
solutions containing an iron chelate with one or more
ligands such as 2-carboxypyridine, 8-hydroxyquinoline
or 2-carboxypyrazine. However, the molar ratios of
these ligands to iron are quite low as demonstrated in
the examples of that publication (less than 0.1:1).PCA and
