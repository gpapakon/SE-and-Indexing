<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium (1) comprising a 
non-magnetic substrate and a magnetic layer and a 

protective layer which are formed on the non-magnetic 
substrate in that order, wherein a substance(s) as a 

single component or a plurality of components, which 
constitute a liquid continuously supplied to the surface 

of said protective layer, are adsorbed on or react with 
the surface of said protective layer to form a lubricating 

film (3) having low frictional properties and low 
wearing-out properties. The present invention can 

realize negligible friction and wear resistance even in 
severe sliding at a very slightly kept-off or completely 

contacted state by continuous supply of a liquid 
lubricant (3) prepared by adding a fluoro compound and an 

extreme pressure agent or an oiliness agent to a solvent 
to the surface of a disc, and can provide a magnetic 

recording reproducer having excellent sliding-resistant 
characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present relates to a magnetic reproducing
recorder
which is excellent in sliding durability.Magnetic media are most generally used as readable
information storages and are widespread in the
fields of not only large computers but also small personal
computers, word processors, and the like. Therefore,
the storage capacity of the magnetic media is
increased year by year, and with this increase,
remarkable technical innovations have been made. Particularly
in hard-type magnetic disk units requiring high
packing density and high-speed writing, among magnetic
recorders, thin film magnetic recording media capable of
having a high packing density have been used in recent
years. With magnetic disks devices, there was the tendency to reduce the distance between the
head and the disk for increasing the
storage capacity, and now this distance is
as short as about 0.1 µm. Therefore, the probability of
contact sliding of the head on the disk
is high not only during suspension of operation but also
during operation of the disk. For this reason, inter alia,
the sliding conditions become severe unavoidably, and 
hence, the sliding durability of the disk is absolutely
necessary for improving the reliability of magnetic
disk units.Now, the lubricating layers of most magnetic
recording media are formed of fluoro compounds, and many
attempts have been made to improve the
sliding durability. For example, methods comprising
coating with or chemical fixing of fluorine-containing
lubricants capable of being easily adsorbed have been
proposed in US 4 120 995, and
JP- 54-36171, JP-59-172159,
JP-59-203239, JP-60-38730, JP-60-109028, JP-60-101717, JP-60-101715,
JP-60-242518, JP-60-202533, JP-60-246020, JP-61-39919, JP-61-104318,
JP-62-42316, JP-63-225918 and JP-63-220420. The fluorine-containing
lubricants described in these documents are
silane-based and phosphoric acid-based lubricants which
react with the surface of an inorganic thin protective
layer on the magnetic layer of a thin film magnetic
recording medium to adhere to the surface. In addition,
methods for improving the sliding durability by forming
a lubricating film consisting of a plurality of components
on the surface of a disk have been proposed in JP-62-257622,
JP-62-257623, JP-2-175791, JP-2-240828, JP-2-249130, JP-3-34121 and JP-4-48435.
Furthermore, methods comprising forming a
lubricating film on a magnetic head slider in the contact
portion with the surface of a disk have been proposed, for example, in
JP- 62-188012, 
JP-62-231411, JP-62-34392, JP-63-48674,
