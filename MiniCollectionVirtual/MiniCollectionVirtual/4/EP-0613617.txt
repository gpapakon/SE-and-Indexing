<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for delivering a fluid, for example, an aromatic compound into an 
atmosphere comprises a pressurised cylinder 4 containing said fluid dissolved in a 

liquefied carrier gas, a valve 12 for controlling the flow of the fluid and the liquefied 
carrier gas from the cylinder 4 to a spray nozzle 6 for delivery to the atmosphere and 

a timer device controlling the opening and closing of the valve 12; the pressurised 
cylinder 4, the valve 12, the timer device 14 and the spray nozzle 6 all being located 

within a housing 2 thereby enabling the apparatus to be self-contained and easily 
manoeuvrable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for delivering a fluid, for example, an 
aromatic compound into an atmosphere. It is known to provide aerosols which are operated automatically on an intermittent 
basis for delivering chemicals into an atmosphere, for example, a lavatory for 
disinfectant purposes or for sweetening the atmosphere in the lavatory. Such aerosols 
because of their size tend to have a short life span and need to be replaced frequently. In UK published patent application 2240042 there is described an apparatus for 
exterminating pests in for example, agricultural greenhouses. The apparatus includes 
a cylinder filled with liquefied carbon dioxide in which is dissolved a pesticide. The 
cylinder is disposed outdoors and a cylinder valve is mounted on the upper end thereof. 
The cylinder valve is coupled to a solenoid valve which is operated by a timer. The arrangement is said to enable the pesticide to be sprayed inside an agricultural 
greenhouse at preselected time intervals. The apparatus described suffers from the disadvantage that it is neither easily 
manoeuvrable nor self-contained. It is an aim of the present invention to provide an apparatus which is portable and can 
stand alone for delivering a fluid such as an aromatic or deodorising compound to 
atmosphere in, for example, a supermarket. According to the present invention an apparatus for delivering a fluid into an atmosphere 
comprises a pressurised cylinder containing the fluid dissolved in a liquefied carrier gas, 
a valve for controlling the flow of the fluid and liquefied carrier gas from the cylinder to 
a spray nozzle for delivery to the atmosphere, the valve being operated by a timer 
device, the apparatus being characterised in that the pressurised cylinder, the valve, the 
timer device and the spray nozzle are all located within a housing. In a preferred embodiment, the housing is provided with wheels and a handle for ease 
of manoeuvrability.  Preferably, the timer device is powered by a battery also located in the housing. 
Alternatively, the timer device can be powered by an external source of power. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example reference 
being made to the Figures of the accompanying diagrammatic drawing in which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic view of an apparatus for delivering a fluid into the atmosphere; 
and Figure 2 is a schematic view of the apparatus of Figure 1 with a housing removed. As shown in the Figures, an apparatus for delivering, for example, an aromatic
