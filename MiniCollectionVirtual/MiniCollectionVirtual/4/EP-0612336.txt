<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chemically reactive fluorescent dyes that can be attached to ligands and the
resulting fluorescently labeled ligands. In particular, the invention relates to chemically reactive dyes that
are derivatives of dipyrrometheneboron difluoride dyes (derivatives of 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene
dyes) that have an absorption maximum at a wavelength longer than about 525 nm. These
reactive dyes are used for the fluorescent labeling of nucleic acids, nucleotides, carbohydrates, drugs,
polymers, proteins, and other biologically derived or synthetic chemical materials.Fluorescent dyes have many uses and are known to be particularly suitable for biological applications
in which the high detectability of fluorescence is required. Fluorescent dyes are used to impart both
visible color and fluorescence to other materials. Many applications utilize chemically reactive
fluorescent dyes by chemically attaching the dye to reactive sites on a wide variety of materials such as
cells, tissues, proteins, antibodies, enzymes, drugs, hormones, lipids, nucleotides, nucleic acids, or
natural or synthetic polymers to make fluorescent conjugates. With these synthetic probes, ligands are
frequently used to confer a specificity for a biochemical reaction that is to be observed and the fluorescent
dye provides the means of detection or quantitation of the interaction.Fluorescence useful for such applications is generally initiated by absorption of light from an
external, relatively concentrated light source. The sensitivity of these applications is improved by having
dyes that have high absorbance of the exciting light and high fluorescence quantum yield. The
applications are furthermore improved by having dyes that resist photobleaching by the exciting light and
that have spectral wavelengths in a range that avoids the background from contaminants that may be
present in the samples. For many biological applications it is useful to have dyes whose fluorescence is
not quenched by water, since most biological measurements are made in aqueous solution.Certain lasers are particularly useful as a concentrated light source for the excitation of fluorescence.
The argon laser has been the most common light source for excitation of fluorescence, with principal
output at 488 nm and 514 nm. Now other lasers are increasingly used, such as helium-neon lasers that
can be selected to have maximum output at either 543 nm, 594 nm, or 633 nm; the krypton laser which
has significant output at 568 nm and 647 nm; and
