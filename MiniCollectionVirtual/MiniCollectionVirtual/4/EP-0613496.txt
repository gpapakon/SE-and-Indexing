<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel collagen-like
polypeptides. More specifically, it relates to collagen-like
polymers which incorporate functional segments
conferring chemical or biological activity and structural
elements designed to enhance processability.Collagen is the most important structural protein
in the bodies of higher animals, accounting for about a
third of the total protein mass in most vertebrates. The
prevalence of collagen in the human body makes collagen-like
constructs interesting as candidates for a wide range
of biomedical applications, especially as implants to
replace or augment damaged or diseased structural tissues.Collagen may be isolated from the skin, tendon, or
bone of vertebrates and is also found throughout the
invertebrates. Naturally derived collagen materials have a
wide range of chemical structures, depending on their
source. These materials may be altered to provide
new materials, as for example, leather and gelatin.Collagen shows several levels of structural
hierarchy. The individual peptide chains are 1000 - 1100
amino acids long and have amino acid sequences consisting
of repeating triplets
Gly - x - y,
where x and y can be any amino acids but are most likely to
be proline or hydroxyproline. The 20 basic amino acids and
hydroxyproline with their corresponding one and three-letter
symbols are listed in Table 12. Proline is
incorporated into peptide chains during protein synthesis;
hydroxyproline is not incorporated during synthesis but
instead is derived from proline by post-synthesis 
modification. Any proline residue in natural collagen or
in any of the collagen-like polymers which are the subject
of this invention can in principle be converted to
hydroxyproline by appropriate chemical or enzymatic
treatment. Therefore, any reference to proline in the
polymer structure or composition of matter of any final
product should be understood, by implication, as a
reference to proline or hydroxyproline. However, any
reference to proline in any structure as initially
synthesized in vivo, or to a DNA sequence which codes for
proline, should be understood as a reference to proline
only, since hydroxyproline cannot be incorporated during
protein synthesis, and there is no DNA sequence which codes
for hydroxyproline.The frequent Pro (and Hyp) residues direct the
peptide chain into a (left-handed) helical conformation,
one turn per triplet. The occurrence of Gly (no bulky side
chain) at every third position allows three helical chains
to pack together into a supercoiled,
