<ABSTRACT>
A plastic bag (30) having a reclosable plastic zipper (42) 
is provided with a tamper-evident, non-reclosable peel 

seal (40) formed by applying an adhesive (38) to a treated strip 
adjacent to the interlocking zipper (42). The treatment is 

preferably by corona discharge, which causes the 
adhesive used to provide the peel seal to 

preferentially adhere to the treated strip when the 
peel seal is broken. A method for manufacturing the 

reclosable plastic zipper includes the steps of 
extruding a zipper profile, treating a portion of its 

surface, preferably by corona discharge, applying an 
adhesive to the treated portion, slitting the profile 

lengthwise, and folding over one of the resulting 
sides of the zipper to interlock them with one 

another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This relates in general to the packaging art,
and more particularly is concerned with a continuous
reclosable plastic zipper of a type which is used to
close the mouth of a bag or package, and which
includes, either before or after the zipper relative
to the mouth of the bag or package, a tamper-evident
non-reclosable peel-seal feature.In the use of plastic bags and packages,
particularly for foodstuffs, it is important that
the bag be hermetically sealed until the purchaser
acquires the bag and its contents, takes them home,
and opens the bag or package for the first time. It
is then commercially attractive and useful for the
consumer that the bag or package be reclosable so
that its contents may be protected. Flexible
plastic zippers have proven to be excellent for
reclosable bags, because they may be manufactured
with high-speed equipment and are reliable for
repeated reuse. A typical zipper is one which has a
groove at one side of the bag mouth and a rib at the
other side, which rib may interlock into the groove
when the sides of the mouth of the bag are pressed
together. Alternatively, a member having a
plurality of ribs may be on one side of the bag
mouth, while a member having a plurality of channels
may be on the other side, the ribs locking into the
channels when the sides of the mouth of the bag are
pressed together. In such a case, there may be no
difference in appearance between the two members, as 
the ribs may simply be the intervals between
channels on a strip which may lock into another of
the same kind. In general, and in short, some form
of male/female interengagement is used to join the
two sides of the bag mouth together. The so-called
members, or strips, are bonded in some manner to the
material from which the bags themselves are
manufactured.Usually, pull flanges extend above the rib and
groove strips, which pull flanges may be pulled
apart for access to the interior of the bag.Although flexible zippers of this variety are
quite popular, they do not always prevent the
inadvertent or unwelcome opening of a bag or package
within the store, and various additions have been made
to provide tamper-evident seals which would reveal
when it has been opened prior to purchase.It is clear then that, in spite of the fairly
high state of development in this art, there are
certain objectives which have not been fully met. In
particular, tamper-evident non-reclosable peel seals
in plastic bags of the prior art remain characterized
by highly inconsistent opening forces. That is to
say, the

<CLAIMS>
A method for forming a tamper-evident, non-reclosable
peel seal for a reclosable plastic bag (10, 30, 50)

comprising the steps:

forming a first flexible plastic web (22; 32; 56) having an
interlockable rib and groove member and a side strip (24)

adjacent thereto;
forming a second flexible plastic web (20; 32; 56) having an
interlockable rib and groove member, said second

flexible plastic web thereby being interlockable with
said first flexible plastic web (22; 32; 56), and a side strip

adjacent thereto;
treating a surface of said side strip (24) of said
first flexible plastic web to modify its receptiveness

to an adhesive;
applying an adhesive (26; 40; 52) to said treated strip (24);
pressing said side strips of said first and
second flexible plastic webs together under-heat;

   so that said adhesive may form a
hermetic, tamper-evident non-reclosable peel seal

between said side strips of said first and second
flexible plastic webs,

   wherein said step
of pressing said side strips of said first and second

flexible plastic webs together under heat comprises
passing said side strip of said first flexible plastic

web over a first sealing bar and passing said side
strip of said second flexible plastic web over a

second sealing bar, said first and second sealing bars
being heated and pressing said side strips of said

first and second flexible plastic webs together, and

   wherein said
first sealing bar is at a higher temperature

than said second sealing bar.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the method comprises the step of

permitting said first and second flexible plastic
webs to cool to form the peel seal. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said first
sealing bar is at a temperature of 182°C (360°F), and said

second sealing bar is at a temperature of 150°C (302°F).
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said step
of treating a surface of said side strip of said first

flexible plastic web to modify its receptiveness to an
adhesive is carried out using a flame treatment

instrument.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said step
of treating a surface of said side strip of said first

flexible plastic web to modify its receptiveness to an
adhesive is carried out using a corona discharge

instrument.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the forming step
comprises extruding a profile having interlockable rib and

groove members and two plane areas; the treating step comprises
treating one of said two plane areas

longitudinally along said profile to modify the
receptiveness of the surface thereof to an adhesive;

the applying step comprises applying said adhesive to said treated plane
area; the method comprising the steps of

   slitting said profile longitudinally to produce
two interlockable sides of said zipper, one side

having said treated plane area; and

   folding over one of said two sides of said
zipper, so that said treated plane area having said

adhesive faces the other of said two plane areas, and
so that said rib and groove members may be interlocked

with one another.
