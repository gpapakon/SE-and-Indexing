<ABSTRACT>
A floating structure (1) 
comprises a sheet held in a predetermined 

position on a water 
surface by struts (2) planted 

in a water bottom or cables 
(8) secured at one end thereof 

to the water bottom, and bank 
walls (2) provided at peripheral 

edges of the sheet to project 
above the water surface. Rigid 

members can be secured to the 
sheet to locally enhance rigidity. 

In addition a floating body 
(70) for wave dissipation may 

be provided at the periphery of 
the floating structure (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a very large floating structure 
which is floated on water surface such as sea surface or lake 
surface. It is used as a planting area, an agricultural area 
or a facility area such as a solar panel installation area or a 
tennis court. Conventionally, an artificial island has been known as a 
kind of a floating structure. The artificial island comprises 
a floating body which is installed under sea surface, a 
platform which is installed on sea surface and many columns for 
connecting between the floating body and the platform. The 
artificial island is used as a submarine oil field camp. Since 
only columns are influenced by the wave, the structure of the 
artificial island is hardly received by the buoyancy 
fluctuation of the wave. The artificial island must be a rigid 
body having high strength because it requires the floating body 
and the platform. So, enormous expenses are needed for 
constructing the artificial island, and it shows heavy weight.  
 
Therefore, the artificial island can be used as a facility 
having high added value such as an artificial city. However, 
the cost is too expensive when the artificial island is used 
for facilities such as an agricultural area, a planting area 
and a solar panel installation area having comparatively low 
added value. Therefore, it is difficult to build more 
facilities, and the spread of facilities is limited. Inventors have attempted to provide an inexpensive and 
light-weight artificial island where more floating structures 
are easily built and which is floated on water surface such as 
sea surface or lake surface instead of a conventional expensive 
artificial island. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a practical floating structure and a locking device 
thereof which are harmless to nature. The floating structure according to the present invention 
comprises a sheet being spread over water surface, and being 
held at the predetermined position by a column which is built 
at the water bottom or a cable body in which one end thereof is 
fixed to the water bottom, and having a levee wall which is 
projected from the water surface at the marginal portion; and a 
rigid member which maintains the rigidity of the sheet. The sheet principally seals water, so water doesn't  
 
penetrate through the sheet and it doesn't ooze out the bottom 
surface to the top surface. As a result, buoyancy is generated 
at the bottom surface to support earth and sand which are 
disposed on the top surface. It is preferable
