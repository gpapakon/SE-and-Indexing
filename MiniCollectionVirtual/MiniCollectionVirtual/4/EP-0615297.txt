<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid, 
polyether-based, polymeric electrolyte, to a process 
for preparing it, and to its use in electrochemical 
devices. In the art solid polymeric electrolytes, also 
referred to as "ionic conductive polymers" are known, 
which are constituted by a solution of a ionic 
compound totally dissolved in a plastic, solid, 
macromolecular material, which is the polymerization 
product of monomers containing at least one heteroatom, 
in particular oxygen. Generally, said macromolecular material is 
polyethylene oxide (PEO), or other polyethers 
disclosed in U.S. patent 4,471,037; French patents 
2,523,769 and 2,568,574; EP-13,037 and EP-13,199. The problems associated with such solid, 
polymeric electrolytes generally consist in their 
displaying a satisfactory ionic conductivity only at 
higher-than-room temperatures and in the poor 
characteristics of mechanical strength and dimensional 
stability of the corresponding electrolytic membranes. 
All the above makes the solid polymeric electrolyte 
known from the prior art not really interesting for a 
practical use. Solid, polymeric, polyvinylether-based 
electrolytes, characterized by good mechanical 
strength and satisfactory ionic conductivity at low 
temperatures, are disclosed in U.S. patent 4,886,716; 
and in EP-A-492 710 (Italian patent No. 22,482 A/90).  
 Unfortunately, the preparation of said 
electrolytes requires complex, multistep processes 
which comprise copolymerizing suitable vinyl ethers at 
temperatures of from -75°C to -80°C, during a time 
period of 30-60 minutes, dissolving the resulting 
solid, crosslinked polyvinylether in a suitable 
solvent, mixing the resulting solution with a solution 
containing an ionic compound, and finally evaporating 
off the solvent, in order to obtain a membrane. Recently, solid, polyether-based polymeric 
electrolytes, displaying good characteristics of 
mechanical strength and ionic conductivity have been 
disclosed in EP-A-638 949 corresponding to Italian patent application No. MI 92 A 01008. The preparation of said solid, polymeric 
electrolytes, which is based on the use of macromers 
having a controlled molecular weight (which, hence, 
contain a known number of side ethylene oxide based 
chains) and a methacrylic group at each chain 
terminal end, in the crosslinking step requires, 
however, using a suitable difunctional comonomer in 
order to obtain dimensionally stable crosslinked 
systems capable of keeping embedded, inside their 
interior, an active plasticizer.
