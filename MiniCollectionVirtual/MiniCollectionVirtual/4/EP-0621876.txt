<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a process for reducing 
the number of insoluble masses which precipitate out of 
a solution of cellulose acetate and acetone. The 
process involves establishing a flow pattern in a 
continuous hydrolysis reactor wherein the radial 
gradient in velocity is very small. Cellulose esters are well known polymers which are 
commercial prepared in a multi-step process. The basic 
steps required for the manufacture of cellulose 
diacetate from cellulose are activation, acetylation, 
hydrolysis and product recovery. In the activation step 
cellulose is contacted with acetic acid to prepare the 
cellulose for further processing. In the acetylation 
step acetic anhydride is reacted with the activated 
cellulose under the influence of a mineral acid catalyst 
to add three acetyl groups to each cellulose ring so as 
to form cellulose triacetate. In the hydrolysis step 
the cellulose triacetate is hydrolyzed to remove enough 
of the acetyl groups to result in an average number of 
acetyl groups per ring of 2.4. This product is often 
referred to as simply cellulose acetate. Finally, the 
cellulose acetate is recovered by mixing the hydrolyzed 
composition with water, dewatering the cellulose acetate 
which precipitates out and drying the dewatered 
cellulose acetate. The requirement that the cellulose acetate have an 
average of 2.4 acetyl groups per ring results from the 
manner in which the cellulose acetate is principally 
used. The principal use of cellulose acetate is to 
prepare fibers by solvent spinning techniques wherein 
the cellulose acetate is dissolved in acetone, the 
acetone solution is extruded through a spinnerette to  
 
form fibers, the fibers are collected and further 
processed and the acetone is recovered and recycled. 
When there are three acetyl groups per ring or when 
there are only two groups per ring the cellulose acetate 
is substantially insoluble in acetone. However, there 
is a range of acetyl substitution between these two 
extremes wherein cellulose acetate is substantially 
completely soluble in acetone. The average of this 
solubility range is 2.4. Thus, in order to maximize the 
solubility of cellulose acetate in acetone and 
facilitate solvent spinning of the cellulose acetate 
into fibers the average number of acetyl groups per ring 
should be around 2.4. The average number of acetyl 
groups per cellulose acetate ring is often referred to 
as the degree of substitution. The requirement that the average number of acetyl 
groups per ring be 2.4 is
