<ABSTRACT>
An enclosure, particularly for multifilament optical fibre 
splices, in which the enclosure (11) has a body (12) with a lid (13) 

hinged thereto to allow access to the splices. The hinges (24) 
allow translational movement as well as pivotal movement of the 

lid (13) so that an even pressure is exerted on any seal between 
the lid (13) and the body (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to enclosures for multifilament cables, 
and is particularly, but not exclusively, concerned with enclosure 
for use with telecommunications cables. Cable splice enclosures which house connectors and 
organizers for multifilament cables, and which comprise a body 
having cable inlet and outlet ports and a closure are known. For 
example such enclosures are described in DE-2626510-C, DE 
3029848, DE-3320916 and DE-4142516. The applicant has in G.9303790.2, filed in Germany on 
15th March 1993, disclosed a cable enclosure in the form of a box 
like housing which is accessible through a lid which is hinged to 
the box like housing. These types of enclosure may remain in the field for many 
years especially when in use in telecommunication systems, and 
the interior of the enclosure must remain accessible for repair and 
alteration of the system, and must be weather proof over such 
extended time periods. The sealing material which is used for such enclosures 
should remain resilient over the extended time period and must 
not creep excessively under load. It is therefore advantageous if 
the sealant is subject to uniform loading during the closure of the 
lid as well as after the enclosure is sealed. Accordingly there is provided an enclosure for multifilament 
cables having cable ports therein and which has a lid hinged to a 
body allowing access to the interior of the enclosure, characterised 
in that the hinge allows translational as well as pivotal movement 
of the lid relative to the body. Preferably each hinge comprises a 
hinge pin fixed to one of the lid and body and an elongate slot, 
within which the pin can rotate and slide, in the other of the lid 
and body. The slot preferably has a width substantially equal to 
the width of the pin (which is preferably of substantially circular 
cross-section), and extends in a direction substantially 
perpendicular to a substantially planar area at which the body  
 
and lid meet when the enclosure is closed. In the preferred 
arrangement the pin is fixed to the lid, and further may be held in 
a lug projecting from the lid so that hinge point is located 
externally of and spaced from the enclosure. The preferred enclosure is a rectangular box-like enclosure 
with an opening lid which when used for an in-line splice 
enclosure in a telecommunications system will have cable ports at 
opposite ends of the enclosure. The box may be held closed by means of at least one wedge 
shaped clamping element which forms part of a tongue and 
groove
