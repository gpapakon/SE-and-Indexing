<ABSTRACT>
A battery-driven electronic appliance comprises means 
for generating the threshold voltage value for selectively 

setting two (high and low) threshold voltage V
H
 or V
L
 depending 
on whether a specific load, for example, a motor (20) of 

a group of loads of a battery (15) is operating or not and a 
battery voltage monitor (21) for determining the advent of 

the replacing or recharging time of the battery depending on 
whether the output voltage Vâ‚€ of the battery is greater or 

smaller than the threshold value. Thus, it becomes possible 
to prevent mistaken determination resulting from the 

operation of the specific load which is great in power consumption 

to prevent the memory effect from occurring in, in 
particular, the secondary battery to enable its effective use 

until the lifetime of the battery is reached.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic appliance
driven by a primary or secondary battery and, in particular,
to a battery-driven electronic appliance having a function of
automatically switching the operating modes according to the
degree to which the battery is consumed. Furthermore, the
present invention relates to a battery-driven electronic
appliance having a function of issuing an alarm by determining
the advent of the time at which the battery should be
replaced or electrically recharged.In a hand-held electronic appliance such as
notebook-type personal computers, word processors, electronic
notebooks, or in an electronic appliance for indoor or outdoor
use, such as hand-held compact disk players, television
sets having a liquid crystal display, camera-integrated video
tape recorders, stress is laid to the readiness to use it or
its basic performance when the battery is driven as the
electric supply rather than when it is connected to the
commercial AC power supply.In particular, such electronic appliances are typically
arranged so that the primary battery such as the disposable
alkali battery or the like can also be used as the power
supply not to say of the secondary battery such as the
rechargeable nickel-cadmium battery or nickel-hydrogen battery.
Since the primary battery cannot be recharged, it is
necessary to replace it by a new primary one when the output
voltage is reduced to below the minimum voltage at which the
electronic appliance is warranted to operate, and to this
end, many of handheld electronic appliances incorporate a
battery voltage monitor which alarms the advent of the time
the battery should be replaced. Furthermore, in the battery-driven electronic appliance
developed on the assumption that the secondary battery is
used, in order to assure the continuous usage time, some
device is used to block a so-called memory effect, which is peculiar
to the secondary battery, from generating. As well known, if
recharging of the second battery is carried out with its end
voltage not consumed, the memory effect is caused and the
voltage at which the recharging is conducted is stored, which
when discharging is conducted next, the battery cannot be
discharged down to the memory voltage with the result that,
as often pointed out, the electric power from the memory
voltage down to the end voltage cannot be used.In order to solve such a drawback, it is also conceivable
as one measure to enlighten users with instruction
manuals so that they do not impair the battery lifetime
