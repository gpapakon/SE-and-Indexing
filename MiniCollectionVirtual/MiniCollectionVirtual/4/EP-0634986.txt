<ABSTRACT>
A translational/rotational support member conveying system including at least one basic conveyor (CE) consisting of two shields (1, 2) each provided with opposed rectilinear (10) and/or circular (11) guide channels, as well as a translating and/or rotating notched belt (3) moving near the guide channels. The system further includes one or more support members (4) with two or more lower pegs (41) engaging the guide channels and the belt notches (30, 31) in order translationally and/or rotationally to drive and guide said support member(s) (4). The system may be used in a flexible linear wiring assembly.

<CLAIMS>
Translational/rotational support member conveying system, including
at least one elementary conveyor (CE) formed on the one hand by two facing

side plates (1, 2), each side plate being provided with facing rectilinear
(10) and/or circular (11) guiding grooves and by a notched belt (3) moving

translationally and/or rotationally, and, on the other hand, by one or more
support members (4) whose base includes at least two tenons (41) engaged

in the guiding grooves, characterized in that the notched belt (3) is in
the vicinity of the said guiding grooves and in that the tenons (41) are

engaged in the notches of the notched belt so that the tenons are guided
between an outer boundary of the groove and the notched belt in order to

ensure, on the one hand, the translational/rotational driving, and, on the
other hand, the translational/rotational guiding of the said support

member(s).
System according to Claim 1, characterized in that each side plate
(1, 2) includes at least two parallel rectilinear grooves (10A, 10B)

connected to one another at their end by a circular groove (11A, 11B), the
set of the said rectilinear and circular grooves forming a single closed-circuit

guiding groove.
System according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the
base of each support member (4i) further includes teeth, each tenon (41)

and each tooth (411) having an adapted profile, the profile of each tenon
(41) having, successively in the direction of travel of the latter with

respect to the guiding groove:

a leading edge formed successively by a plane face (410a), a convex
face (410b), a convex transition face (410c), a plane face (410d) forming

the trailing edge of the tenon in the guiding groove, the profile of each
tooth (411) having successively in the direction of travel of the latter:
a plane face (411a) for joining to the profile of the said tenon,
a plane leading face (411b) inclined with respect to the said plane joining

face (411a), the angle of inclination corresponding to the angle of
inclination of the bearing face of the notches of the said notched belt,

a convex cylindrical surface (411c) of given radius of curvature, a first
plane surface (411d) parallel to the said joining surface (411a), the said

convex cylindrical surface (411c) being tangent to the inclined leading
surface (411b) and to the parallel plane surface (411d), a first concave 

cylindrical surface (411e) whose profile has a point of inflection
permitting connection to the said first plane surface (411d), a second

plane surface (411f) whose dimension in the direction of the profile
corresponds to that of each notch of the notched belt in the turn, a second

concave cylindrical surface (411g) permitting connection to the trailing
edge (410d) via a cut-off plane.
System according to Claim 3, characterized in that

the radius of curvature of the convex face (410b) forming the
leading edge has a value substantially equal to that of the radius of

curvature of the outer face of the circular guiding groove (10, 11),
the radius of curvature of the first concave cylindrical face
(411e) of the profile of each tooth has a value substantially equal to that

of an indentation (31) of the notched belt (3) when the latter is in the
rotational driving position,
the radius of curvature of the second concave cylindrical face
(411g) of the profile of each tooth has a value substantially equal to that

of a projection (30) of the notched belt (3) when the latter is in the
rotational driving position, which permits the teeth (411) and respectively

the leading edge of each tenon (41) to be kept constantly bearing on a
projection (30) and an indentation (31) of the notched belt (3) and

respectively on the outer boundary of the guiding groove (10, 11) whatever
the rotational and/or translational driving movement by the notched belt

(3).
System according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that, for a notched belt (3) driven translationally/rotationally by means

of at least one driving pulley (20), each support member (4), upon the
translation/rotation transition of the driving by th
e said belt (3) has an
instantaneous centre of rotation passing progressively from a point

situated at infinity to a point coinciding with the circular guiding
centre.
System according to Claim 1, characterized in that each side plate
(1, 2) is formed by a metallic plate in the thickness of which the guiding

groove(s) (10, 11) are formed, the base of the said support members (4)
being formed of a self-lubricating plastic material.
System according to Claim 6, characterized in that an elementary
conveyor (CE) includes at least: 


two facing side plates (1, 2) provided with two parallel
rectilinear guiding grooves (10A, 10B) connected at their end by a circular

guiding groove (11A), these parallel guiding grooves (10A, 10B) being open
at their end,
switching blocks (50, 51) mounted in the vicinity of the junction
between each rectilinear (10A, 10B) and circular (11A) guiding groove, the

junction blocks having a profile complementary to the profile of the
rectilinear and circular guiding grooves respectively, and being mounted

to slide between two positions so as to permit in a first position the
continuity of the connection between circular (11A) and rectilinear (10A,

10B) guiding groove, the open end of the said rectilinear groove being
closed, and respectively in a second position the continuity of the

connection between rectilinear guiding groove (10A, 10B) and the open end
of the latter, the corresponding circular guiding groove (11A) being

closed.
System according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that each
circular guiding groove (11A) is supplemented at its periphery by at least

one rectilinear switching guiding groove (11C) which is oblique with
respect to the said rectilinear guiding grooves (10A, 10B).
System according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that it
comprises a plurality of aligned elementary conveyors (CE).
