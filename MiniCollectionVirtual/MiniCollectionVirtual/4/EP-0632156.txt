<ABSTRACT>
A fixing system of a frontal panel to the door of an electric appliance is described, in 
particular a dish-washing machine for domestic use; the described fixing system 

provides one or more fixing elements (10;11) on the panel (12), that couple to a 
corresponding number of fixing elements (3;20) on the door (1), in order to realise a 

hooking device by means of translation of the panel respect to the door.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a system for fixing a frontal panel to the door of a
household appliance, in particular a dishwasher for domestic use.It is known that with washing machines, in particular dishwashers, it is customary
practice to apply a decorative panel on the door at the moment of installation, a
panel that matches the decor of the other elements of the environment, usually a
kitchen, where the machine is installed. The application and the fixing of such
decorative element must therefore be the easiest and safest possible, for obvious
reasons of cost and reliability.It is also known that, depending on the type of washing machine, the problems of
fixing the decorative panel can be numerous; for example, in the case of dish-washing
machines, different adaptions must be utilised for the so-called "integrated"
machines and for those being "built in": in the first case the door of the dish-washing
machine has a command panel, beneath which the decorative panel must be fixed;
with the built in machines the door must be fully covered by the decorative panel
(the commands, in such type of machine, are arranged on the upper edge of the
door).Various fixing systems have been proposed that, however, are often complicated, or
of an assembly being rather difficult, or unreliable, or expensive, or unfit for being
used on machines having different characteristics.For instance, from EP-A-0261083 a device for coupling a decorative panel to
the door of a household appliance is known, wherein coupling and fastening
means are provided on the front face of the door and the rear face of the panel;
said fastening means comprise a pin to be inserted into a hole with a snap-type
movement, whereby a spring biased slider assure that the pin remains
blocked into the slot. This known system, while allowing a quick and easy application of the panel,
is very complicated and expensive from the manufacturing viewpoint.The aim of the present invention is that of illustrating a fixing system of a decorative
panel to the door of an electric appliance, in particular a dish-washing machine for
domestic use, that results in being very simple, economic, safe and versatile.In view to realise such aim the present invention has for its subject a system
for fixing a frontal panel to the door of an electric appliance, in particular a
dish-washing machine for domestic use, having the characterizing features of
the annexed claim 1.The characteristics and advantages of the fixing system according to invention will
appear in the

<CLAIMS>
System for fixing a frontal panel to the door of an electrical appliance, in
particular a dish-washing machine for domestic use, wherein at least one fixing

element (10;11) on the panel (12) is coupled to a corresponding fixing element
(3;20) on the door (1), the coupling between said fixing elements (10,3;11,20) being

realized following a translation of the panel (12) with respect to the door (1), and
wherein one of the fixing elements comprises at least one tongue (10;11), in

particular on the panel (12), and the other one of the fixing elements includes at
least one louver (3;20), in particular on the door (1), 
characterized in that
said tongue (10) extends in the same direction as the translation movement being
necessary for coupling the panel (12) with the door (10), and in a way that

following the engagement of said tongue (10) with the edge of said
louver (3), the panel (12) results in being hooked to a first region of the door (1)

and held in position;
the fixing between the panel (12) and the door (1) is completed by means of
screws (14), which fasten the panel (12) to a second portion of the door (1).
System, according to claim 1, characterized in that said coupling between
said tongue (10) and louver (3) occurs in the lower portion of the door (1) and the

fastening by means of said screws (14) occurs in the upper portion of the door (1).
System, according to claim 1, characterized in that said translation of the
panel (12) with respect to the door (1) and said coupling between said tongue (10)

and louver (3) take place in a horizontal direction.
System, according to claim 1, characterized in that said translation of the
panel (12) with respect to the door (1) and said coupling between said tongue (10)

and louver (3) take place in a vertical direction.
System, according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said screws (14)
are inserted in a small plastic cylinder (13) being arranged in a hole provided in said

door (12), said hole in the door being in particular plugged by means of a plastic
plug (15).
System, according to claim 1, characterized in that said fixing elements on
the panel (12) include a cross member (5) defining said at least one tongue (10;11).
System, according to claim 6, characterized in that said tongue (10;11) is
obtained by notching the sheetplate of said cross member (5). 
System, according claims 3 and 4, characterized in that said fixing
elements on the panel (12) and the door (1) are realized in order that the translation

of the panel with respect to the door can take place both in the horizontal sense and
in the vertical sense, depending upon the fixing necessity.
System, according to claim 8, characterized in that said fixing elements on
the panel (12) include a cross member (5), having one or more tongues (10)

directed horizontally and one or more tongues (11) directed vertically, said tongues
(10
,11) being in particular obtained by notching the sheetplate of the cross member
(5).
System, according to claim 9, characterized in that said fixing elements on
the door (12) include one or more louvers (3) in which said tongues (10) directed

horizontally can be engaged and one or more louvers (20) in which said tongues
(11) directed vertically can be engaged.
System, according to at least one of previous claims, characterized in that
one or more louvers (4,21) are provided on the door (12) within which said tongues

(10) directed horizontally and/or said tongues (11) directed vertically can be inserted
without becoming engaged.
System, according to one or more of the previous claims, characterized in
that the orientation of said cross member (5), for the hooking by way of horizontal

translation of the panel with respect to the door, is inverted (180Â°) respect the
orientation of said cross member for the hooking by way of vertical translation.
