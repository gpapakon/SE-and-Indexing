<ABSTRACT>
The junction area (43) of the workpieces (27, 29) is surrounded by an enclosure (38) mounted in a sealed manner around part of the external surface of the component (31). The enclosure (28) carries an electron gun (39). A reduced pressure is established inside a chamber (44) bounded by the sealed enclosure (38) and by the external surface of the component (31). A relative movement between the workpieces (27, 29) and the electron gun (39) is set up in order to sweep the junction area (43) by an electron beam emitted by the electron gun (39) during the welding. The method can be used in particular in the field of the manufacture of steam generators for pressurised-water nuclear reactors.
