<ABSTRACT>
This storage device (70) includes at least one 
elementary memory cell (10), means (45,46,47,48) for 

writing a set of n bits of data into each said at least one 
elementary memory cell, and/or means (47,64,66,72) for 

reading a set of n bits of data from each said at least one 
elementary memory cell (10), with n ≧ 2. Thus, the data bit 

storage capacity of the storage device (70) exceeds the 
number of elementary memory cells (10) contained in said 

storage device. 
The writing of several bits into a single memory 
cell occurs by applying to said cell a threshold voltage 

which is representative of said several bits. The reading 
of the stored bits is performed by applying a plurality of 

successive voltages to the memory element and monitoring 
the event of a current flowing through a detector means 

(64).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an elementary 
memory cell, a storage device including a plurality of such 
elementary memory cells, and a method for writing/reading 
information into/from said storage device and memory cell. There is an ever increasing demand for improvements 
in the amount of information which can be stored in 
a memory, such as, for example, a non-volatile memory in 
the form of an electrically erasable programmable read only 
memory (EEPROM or E²PROM) or an erasable programmable read 
only memory (EPROM). Traditionally, this demand has been met by 
reducing the size of each memory cell, such that a greater 
number of cells can be located in a given area. Inevitably, 
this leads to the need to redesign cell layouts and the 
photolithography equipment, and to an ever increasing 
stretch on the capabilities of the machinery needed to 
reduce the size of the cells. Therefore, there will eventually come a stage 
where further reduction of the size of the cell is no 
longer possible due to equipment constraints. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide an elementary memory cell with improved 
storage capacity, capable of storing n ≧ 2 data bits of 
information in each single memory cell, yet without need to 
further reduce the size of the elementary cell used. It is a further object of the invention to 
provide a storage device using a plurality of such memory 
cells. It is a further object of the invention to 
provide a method and the associated peripheral hardware, to 
write data into and/or read data from a memory cell or a 
storage device as defined above.  These objects are achieved by the memory cell and 
storage device according to the invention, and by the 
method for writing information into or read information 
from such a memory cell or storage device, as defined in 
the appending claims, which are summarized below : The storage device using an array of memory 
elements, is characterized in that it includes means for 
writing a set of n bits of data into each said at least one 
elementary memory cell, and/or means for reading a set of

memory cell, with n ≧ 2, whereby the data bit storage 
capacity of said storage device exceeds the number of 
elementary memory cells contained in said storage device. According to further features of the storage 
device : 
said means for writing a set of n bits of data 
into each said at least one elementary memory cell includes 
digital to analog converter means for
