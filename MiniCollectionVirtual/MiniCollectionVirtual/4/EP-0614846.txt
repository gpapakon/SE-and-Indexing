<ABSTRACT>
Device for arresting a supporting arm, designed as an articulated arm and articulated rotatably about an articulation axis on a vertically displaceable lifting carriage of a hoisting platform, against rotation about the articulation axis, in which a first arresting part 3 connected in a rotationally locked manner to the supporting arm 14 has one or more engagement points 15, a second arresting part 1 having one or more engagement points 16 is movably guided on the lifting carriage 7 in a guide 2 into an engagement position in which the engagement points 15 and 16 interlock on both arresting parts 3, 1, and the guide 2 is arranged on the lifting carriage in such a way that the second arresting part 1, at least in the engagement position, is secured against rotation about the articulation axis 18 of the supporting arm 14.
