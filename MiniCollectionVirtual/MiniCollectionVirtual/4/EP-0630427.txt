<ABSTRACT>
Tinplate stock is cleaned with a cleaning bath that has a pH of 8 to 11 and that consists of water; 0.5 to 10.0 g/L of alkali builder comprising one or more selections from the alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal and ammonium salts of inorganic phosphoric acid, alkali metal borates, alkali metal silicates, and alkali metal and ammonium carbonates; 0.05 to 1.0 g/L of chelating agent comprising one or more selections from the hydroxyalkyldiphosphonic acids, aminotrialkylphosphonic acids, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, condensed phosphoric acids, and the alkali metal and ammonium salts of the preceding; and 0.05 to 2.0 g/L of surfactant. The use of this bath composition allows continuous cleaning in which the production of Sn sludge is inhibited and the amount of sludge produced by wastewater treatment is reduced substantially.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid composition, generally denoted for 
brevity hereinafter as a "bath" or more specifically as a "tinplate-cleaning bath", that 
is used to clean the surface of tinplate (i.e., tin plated steel), especially in the form of 
sheet, strip, and products made by shaping them, e.g., cans and other containers and 
the like. These various forms of tinplate are collectively known as tinplate stock. The 
present invention also relates to a process for cleaning tinplate stock. In particular, 
the present invention is excellently suited for cleaning "DI" tinplate cans that are fabricated 
by the drawing and ironing of tinplate sheet and strip. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel tinplate-cleaning bath 
and process that, when applied to the surface of tinplate, results in the removal of organic 
materials (e.g., oil, lubricants, etc.) and inorganic materials (e.g., abrasives, etc.) 
and the generation of a surface condition that is well adapted for conversion treatment. 
Moreover, this novel tinplate-cleaning bath and process are strongly resistant to the 
deposition of the sludge that is caused by the insolubilization of tin eluted by cleaning 
into the bath from the surface of the tinplate stock. The prior art for tinplate-cleaning baths is exemplified by Japanese Patent Publication 
[Kokoku] Number Sho 59-2752 [2,752/1984] and Japanese Patent Application 
Laid Open [Kokai or Unexamined] Numbers Hei 3-59993 [59,993/1991] and Hei 
3-59994 [59,994/1991]. The alkaline cleaning bath of Japanese Patent Publication Number Sho 59-2752 
contains alkali metal silicate, alkali metal salt and alkali metal bicarbonate at ≤ 
1.5-fold (weight basis) of the amount of alkali metal silicate, and surfactant at ≤ 
0.4-fold (weight basis) of the amount of alkali metal silicate. This particular alkali 
component (known as builder) is specified in order to inhibit excessive dissolution of 
the tinplate surface due to line stoppage caused by problems in the degreasing line. As for the bath discussed above, the alkaline cleaning bath of Japanese Patent 
Application Laid Open Number Hei 3-59993 is intended to inhibit excess dissolution  
 
of the tinplate surface. This bath is an aqueous solution that contains 1.5 to 10 grams 
per liter (hereinafter often abbreviated "g/L") of alkali metal or ammonium salt of 
orthophosphoric acid and 0.5 to 2 g/L of alkali metal nitrite. These two components 
are used in a molar ratio (former : latter) of 1 : 1 to 3.86 : 1. Bath pH is
