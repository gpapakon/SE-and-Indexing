<ABSTRACT>
A method for batching granular articles (2) provides 
to supply an suitable amount of such granular articles 

(2) over a batching cask (8), joined to elastic 
means (9) designed to form in the upper part an 

inclined concave surface that acts as a mouth for 
the same batching cask (8). The mouth is aimed at 

receiving the granular articles (2) to fill the cask 
(8). Then the batching cask (8) is moved to a raised 

position in which said elastic means (9) are kept 
taut protruding upwards thus forming in the upper 

part an inclined convex surface, so as to determine 
spontaneous removal of articles (2) exceeding the 

prefixed dose, that fall along said inclined surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention lies in the technical field 
concerning batching granular and similar articles, 
in particular delicate and easily perishable articles. There are used batching devices that fill bottles or 
other containers with a prefixed quantity of a 
product, e.g. granular, powdered or similar substances. Such devices usually have a rotating carousel equipped 
peripherally with a plurality of batching casks, 
distributed regularly, in contact with a space or an 
angular channel that is fed with the product to be 
put in the bottles. The lower parts of the casks are closed by a shutter 
that can be opened, in a special operative station, 
in order to unload the product into a hopper aimed 
at filling a bottle that is placed below. The aforementioned casks are designed to define the 
dose of the product to be put in each bottle. The casks are filled with the product put into the 
feeding channel of the carousel. There is provided a fixed scraper means that extends 
vertically in a shutter like fashion inside the 
carousel channel, that is up to the bottom of the 
same channel, e.i. at the level of the upper border 
of the casks.  
 Therefore, during the rotation of the carousel, the 
product in the channel of the carousel is pushed by 
the scraper into the spaces defined by the aforementioned 
casks. In fact, the fixed scraper leaves the product in the 
feeding channel while scraping it at the level of 
the batching casks. Such batching method cannot be applied when the 
bottles are to be filled with delicate products, 
that cannot be crushed. In fact, the batching means compresses the product 
that is forced against it by the carousel rotation. 
Such mechanical action can crush a part of product 
and cause its damage. The object of the present invention is to propose 
such a method for batching granular and similar 
products that surely avoids crushing or damage of 
the product. The above mentioned object is obtained by the method according to 
claim 1 and the device according to claim 3. Preferred embodiments are 
characterised in the dependent claims. The characteristics of the invention are pointed out 
in the following, with particular reference to the 
enclosed drawing, in which; 
fig. 1 shows a schematic, plan view of the batching 
device being the subject of the invention; fig. 2 shows a view, in vertical section, of such 
device, in the phase of feeding the product, according 
to the section line II-II of fig. 1; figs. 3, 4 and 5 show subsequent operative phases  
 
of the device, in a

Method for batching granular and similar articles 
by feeding a 

suitable quantity of granular articles (2) via a 
batching cask (8), 
characterised in that
 said batching cask (8), in 
its upper part, is joined to elastic means (9) designed to form an 

inclined concave surface that acts as a mouth for the same 
batching cask (8), so as to fill said batching cask 

(8) with said granular articles (2); and for displacing 
said batching cask (8) in a raised position in 

which said elastic means (9) are kept taut so as to 
protrude upwards thus forming an 

inclined convex surface, so as to provoke spontaneous 
removal of the articles (2) exceeding the preestablished 

dose, that fall along said inclined 
surface. 
Method, according to claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 the exceeding articles (2), remaining on said 
filled batching cask (8), are removed by a scraper 

means (22) that is designed to skim the upper edge 
of the same batching cask (8). 
Device for the batching of granular and similar 
articles, comprising a rotating carousel (6) that is 

designed to carry a plurality of bottles (3), located 
in regular spaced apart relation with respect to 

each other, comprising a 
plurality of batching casks (8) carried by said 

carousel (6) over said bottles (3) 
characterised in that
 said batching 
casks (8), in their upper parts, are joined respectively to elastic 

means (9) designed to form an inclined concave surface that 
acts as feed opening for each of said batching casks (8) and 

in that it has means (12) designed to operate the motion of said  
 

batching casks (8) between a lowered position, in 
correspondence with a filling station (100), so as 

to fill said batching casks (8) with an appropriate 
quantity of articles (2), and a raised position, in 

which said elastic means (9) are kept taut so as to 
protrude upwards thus forming an 

inclined convex surface, so as to determine the 
spontaneous removal of the articles (2) exceeding 

the pre-established dose, by falling along said 
inclined surface. 
Device, according to claim 3, 
characterised in 
that
 said elastic means (9) consist of an 
elastic diaphragm that is integral, in correspondence 

with a central opening, to the top of a relative 
batching cask (8) and is peripherally fixed to 

the edge of a relative circular opening (10) made in 
the bottom of a channel (7) of said carousel (6). 
Device, according to claim 3, 
characterised in 
that
 it comprises, coaxial with each of said batching 
casks (8) and below the latter, a respective 

hopper (13) fastened to said operating means (12) 
and designed to enter a relative bottle (3) to be 

filled. 
Device, according to claim 3, 
characterised in 
that
 it comprises, downstream of said filling station 
(100), a scraper means (22) designed to skim 

the upper edge of said filled batching casks (8), 
remove the articles (2) in excess remaining on said 

batching casks (8).
