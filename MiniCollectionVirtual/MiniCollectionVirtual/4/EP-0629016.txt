<ABSTRACT>
Vibration type bubble floating promotion means and device 
relates to direct 

or indirect vibration applied against the housing of a battery to 
promote bubble floating speed in the electrolyte during 

the process of charge/discharge so as to minimize the 
rise of battery internal resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The conventional battery will appear temperature 
rising continuously because of internal resistance 
during the process of charge or discharge to result in 
the release of gas from the electrolyte form bubbles 
thereof. The existence of bubbles will reduce effective 
guiding are for electrolyte, result in increasing the 
current density passing under the same area to cause 
temperature rising and therefore to make the battery 
become worse in performance. The present vibration type 
bubble floating promotion means and device during the 
process of battery charge/discharge relates to direct 
vibration or indirect vibration against the housing to 
promote bubble floating speed in the electrolyte during 
the process of charge/discharge so as to minimize the 
rise of battery internal resistance due to excessive 
bubbles, the rise of temperature that results in forming 
much more bubbles and that again results in increasing 
internal resistance, i.e. to eliminate such an adversed 
cycle like this. FIG. 1 is a diagramatic view showing the basic 
structure of the present vibration type bubble floating 
promotion means and device during the process of battery 
charge/discharge.  FIG. 2 is an embodiment showing a transducer 
mounted in the housing. FIG. 3 is an embodiment showing the transducer 
mounted in the housing of battery is immersed in the 
electrolyte. The basic structure of the present design is 
described as follows. Referring to FIG. 1, a diagramatic view showing the 
basic structure of the present vibration type bubble 
floating promotion means and device during the process 
of battery charge/discharge wherein the main structure 
comprising:
 
   a battery 101: an acid or alkaline battery 
containing electrolyte;
 
   a vibration base: a moving up/down or 
right-handed/left-handed or synthetical vibration 
structure driven by transducer 102 by means of solenoid 
or magnetic hystersis telescoping or other mechanical 
transformation or displacement with electric energy, and 
he battery is loaded thereon;
 
   a vibration power supply unit 103: to provide 
electric energy input subject to the necessary frequency 
and voltage current value for the transducer 102; the 
vibration power supply unit may be independent or 
integrally mounted on the housing together with the 
vibration base and transducer. The transducer of the vibration base is excited by 
electric energy produced by the vibration power supply  
 
unit for vibrating while gearing the battery on the base 
to produce vibration so as to help
