<ABSTRACT>
A process for the dyeing of a fibrous article containing wool with an anionic dye and products produced thereby. The process includes immersing the article in a dyeing bath of a liquid solvent for the anionic dye. The liquid solvent and the article are heated to a temperature at least equal to the dyeing transition temperature. At least a portion of the dye is added as a miscible liquid concentrate while the solvent and the article are up to temperature. Stirring of the bath during the dye addition period and while the solvent and article are up to temperature is done to mix the dye concentrate with the solvent to form a dilute dye solution and to provide a flow of the dilute dye solution relative to the article to cause, on the average, essentially uniform dye transport of the anionic dye to the article. The dye addition rate is adjusted so that the dye addition rate is the primary control over the rate of dye uptake by the article.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the dyeing of 
fibrous articles containing wool with anionic dyes. Anionic dyes such as acid dyes and pre-metallized 
dyes are widely used for the dyeing of wool. In 
conventional dyeing processes using such dyes, articles 
containing wool are immersed in an aqueous bath containing 
a solution of the dye after any pre-treatment processes 
such as scouring. While a wide variety of dyeing 
equipment is used, it is typical for all of the dye to be 
used in the process to be present in the bath initially. 
The bath containing the dye and the article to be dyed is 
also usually at a very low initial temperature, e.g., 80-120°F 
(26.7-48.9°C) and the temperature is increased 
gradually to an elevated temperature often as high as the 
boiling point as the dyeing progresses. "Metallizing" 
treatments with, e.g., with potassium dichromate, are 
often performed subsequently to dyeing to increase dye 
light and/or wash fastness. While high quality dyeing can be achieved using 
the conventional dyeing process for some acid dyes such as 
small molecule "levelling" dyes, dye cycles to achieve 
levelling with such anionic dyes are sometimes extremely 
long and are therefore costly. In addition, long dye 
cycles are undesirable since the maintenance of the bath 
at a high dyeing temperature for a long period of time can 
decrease the strength of wool. It is very common to dye 
wool using large molecule acid and pre-metallized dyes 
which are desirable for applications requiring good light 
and/or wash fastness. However, undesirable dyeings can 
result with conventional dyeing processes using large 
molecule acid and pre-metallized dyes since individual 
wool fibers may not dye uniformly. Often, one end of a 
fiber will dye readily while the other end will absorb 
little dye resulting in an "skittery" dyeing in the 
article, i.e., noticeable localized dark/light areas.  
 Large molecule acid and pre-metallized dyes are 
often referred to as "structure sensitive" dyes since non-uniform 
dyeing can result from minor variations in the 
fiber physical structure. While dye-levelling and/or 
retarding agents can be added to the dye bath to improve 
dyeing uniformity with structure sensitive dyes, such 
agents sometimes provide only limited increases in dye 
uniformity and usually have disadvantages including 
increased initial expense and higher cost to treat the 
spent dyeing bath. In addition, because of their 
retarding effect, such chemical agents can sometimes 
increase dyeing cycles or

A process for dyeing a fibrous article containing wool

immersing said article in a dyeing bath of a liquid 
solvent for said anionic dye; 
heating said liquid solvent and said article in said 
dyeing bath to a temperature at least equal to the

miscible liquid concentrate at a dye addition rate during 

a dye addition period, at least a portion of said dye
