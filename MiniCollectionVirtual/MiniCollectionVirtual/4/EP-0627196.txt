<ABSTRACT>
A method of measuring lung function in a subject includes connecting 
a pneumotach in series with the subject's airway and taking pressure 

readings upstream and downstream of a fixed resistance element (30) in 
the pneumotach. Second pressure readings are taken with a second 

resistance element (46) in place, and the sets of readings are processed 
to calculate characteristic flow curves for the subject's airway. First and 

second time constants (τ) are calculated from the flow curves, and are 
used to calculate values of lung compliance (C
lt
) and airway resistance 
(R
aw
). The invention extends to a pneumotach device with a fixed first 
resistance element and a removable second resistance element. The 

invention also extends to apparatus for monitoring lung function 
including the pneumotach device, together with a pair of pressure 

sensors (50) and a processor circuit (52, 54, 56, 58, 60) for carrying out 
the necessary calculations of the time constants, and the lung compliance 

and airway resistance values. A display (62) is provided for giving an 
indication of the calculated values.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a method of measuring lung function in a
subject and to apparatus for use in carrying out the measurement.The measurement of lung function in humans and other animals has
various applications. In patients with emphysema or other respiratory
tract diseases, the monitoring of lung function may be useful both in
treating the disease and carrying out research. It is also useful to
monitor lung capacity and function in sportsmen and women. Various
other applications for such measurements exist.Two significant parameters in measuring lung function are airway
resistance (Raw) and compliance of the lung and thorax (Clt). These
parameters are analogous to electrical resistance and capacitance, and
define a time constant τ = Raw x Clt. Previously, airway resistance has
been measured by the use of a body plethysmograph, while compliance
of the lung and thorax has been measured by the use of a swallowed
balloon. This is clearly a cumbersome and awkward procedure.US-A-5 060 655 describes a pneumotach for measuring respiratory
flow. The pneumotach has an air passageway with a restrictive screen
disposed in it. The flow rate of air through the passageway is calculated from
a differential pressure across the screen. It is an object of the invention to provide an alternative method of and 
apparatus for measuring lung function.According to the invention a method of monitoring lung function in a
subject comprises the steps of:
connecting a pneumotach in series with the subject's airway;taking first airway pressure readings upstream and downstream
of a first resistance element in the pneumotach;inserting or removing a second resistance element in the
pneumotach so that the total resistance in the subject's airway is
changed;taking second airway pressure readings upstream and downstream
of the first resistance element in the pneumotach;processing the first and second pressure readings to calculate
respective first and second characteristic flow curves for the
subject's airway;deriving first and second time constants from the first and second
flow curves; andcalculating values of lung compliance and airway resistance for
the subject from the first and second time constants.A plurality of first and second airway pressure readings are 
taken for calculation of the respective first and second airway flow
curves.The airway flow curves are preferably curves of air flow against time,
from which the lung time constants can be derived.Further according to the invention pneumotach apparatus for monitoring
