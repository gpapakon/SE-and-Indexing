<ABSTRACT>
In order to make available a completely new type of design for a lift-truck which is constructed simply using proven technology and is designed such that it is not susceptible to faults and is in particular suitable for transferring loads on so-called "cassettes", according to the invention two swinging axles are provided per axis line (11 to 14), which swinging axles are each secured rotatably on a supporting frame (4) via a vertical axis (16), a control device being provided which, when the truck moves diagonally, steers all of the swinging axles to the left or right, independently of the steering angle between the drive unit (1) and supporting frame (4), into a defined stop position.
