<DESCRIPTION>
Tr1azolopyr1mid1nesulfonam1des as herbicidesThe present invention relates to novel herbicidally active and plant-growth-inhibiting triazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine-2-sulfonamides, to processes for their preparation, compositions containing these triazolopyrimidinesulfonamides as active ingredients, and to their use for controlling weeds, especially selectively in crops of useful plants, and for inhibiting the growth of plants.l,2,4-Triazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine-2-sulfonamides which have a herbicidal activity are known. Such compounds are described, for example, in US Patent 4 818 273.Novel herbicidally active triazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine-2-sulfonamides have now been which are distinguished from the l-2,4-triazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine-2-sulfonamides which have already been disclosed by the fact that they are more readily degradable.The triazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine-2-sulfonamides according to the invention are those of the formula Iin which 

 C1-C4haloalkyl, CrC4alkoxy, CrC4haloalkoxy, C1-C4alkoxy-C1-C4-alkyl, nitro, phenyl or S(0)nR3; R3 is CrC4alkyl, CrC4haloalkyl, C2-C4alkenyl, C2-C4alkynyl, benzyl or optionally substituted phenyl; n is the number 0, 1 or 2; R4, R5, R6, R and R8
independently of one another are hydrogen or CrC4alkyl; and X and Y independently of one another are hydrogen, ^alkyl or C3~C6cycloalkyl; and the agrochemically acceptable salts of these compounds, with the proviso that the radicals X and Y are not simultaneously hydrogen.Halogen in the above definitions is to be understood as meaning fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably fluorine, chlorine and bromine.Suitable alkyl groups for Rj to Rg, X and Y can be straight-chain or branched alkyl groups, for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, iso-butyl or tert-butyl; preferably alkyl groups having 1 to 2 carbon atoms.Haloalkyl groups which are suitable for Rl5 R2 and R3 are alkyl groups which are mono- or polysubstituted by halogen, halogen specifically being fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Preferred from amongst these alkyl groups which are mono- or polysubstituted by halogen are alkyl groups which are mono- to trisubstituted by halogen, in particular fluorine or chlorine, for example fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, dichloromethyl, trichloromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 2-fluoroethyl, 2-chloroethyl and 2,2,2-trichloroethyl; preferably difluoromethyl and trifluoromethyl.Alkoxy radicals which are suitable for R-- and R2 are, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy, iso-propyloxy,
