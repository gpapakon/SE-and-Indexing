<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of converting speech, in which method reflection coefficients are calculated from a speech signal (601) of a speaker, from which reflection coefficients are calculated (604) charateristics of cross-sectional areas of cylinder portions of a lossless tube modelling the speaker's vocal tract, sounds are identified (605) from said characteristics of the speaker and provided with respective identifiers. Subsequently, differences between the stored (608) characteristics representing said sound and respective following characteristics representing the same sound are calculated (606), a second speaker's speaker-specific characteristics modelling that speaker's vocal tract for the same sound are searched for (610) in a memory (611) on the basis of the identifier of the identified sound, a sum is formed (613) by summing said differences (617) and the second speaker's speaker-specific characteristics (612) modelling that second speaker's vocal tract for the same sound, new reflection coefficients are calculated (614) from that sum, and a new speech signal (616) is produced (615) from said new reflection coefficients.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of converting
speech, in which method samples are taken of a speech
signal produced by a first speaker for the calculation
of reflection coefficients.The speech of speech-handicapped persons is
often unclear and sounds included therein are difficult
to identify. The speech quality of speech-handicapped
persons causes problems especially when a
communications device or network is used for transmitting
and transferring a speech signal produced by
a speech-handicapped person to a receiver. On account
of the limited transmission capacity and acoustic
properties of the communications network, the speech
produced by the speech-handicapped person is then
still more difficult to identify and understand for a
listener. On the other hand, regardless of whether a
communications device or network transferring speech
signals is used, it is always difficult for a listener
to identify and understand the speech of a
speech-handicapped person.In addition, at times there is a need to try to
change a speech produced by a speaker in such a way
that the sounds of the speech could be corrected to a
better sound format or that the sounds of the speech
produced by that speaker would be converted into the
same sounds of another speaker and then the speech of
the first speaker would actually sound like the
speech of the second speaker. The object of this invention is to provide a
method, by which a speech of a speaker can be changed
or corrected in such a way that the speech heard by a
listener or the corrected or changed speech signal
obtained by a receiver corresponds either to a speech
produced by another speaker or to the speech of the
same speaker corrected in some desired manner.This novel method of converting speech is provided
by a method according to the appended claims. The invention is based on the idea that a
speech signal is analyzed by means of the LPC (Linear
Prediction Coding) method, and a set of parameters
modelling a speaker's vocal tract is created, which
parameters typically are characteristics of reflection
coefficients.
W092/20064, by the same inventor, discloses a speaker
recognition method using such parameters. US-A-5 121 434
discloses a speech synthesis method by vocal tract simulation, which
is also using such parameters.
According to the invention, sounds
are then identified from the speech to be converted
by comparing the cross-sectional areas of the cylinders
of the lossless tube calculated from the reflection
coefficients of the sound to be converted with
several

<CLAIMS>
A method of converting speech, comprising :

taking (601) samples of a speech signal (IN) produced
by a first speaker and calculating (602) reflection

coefficients (r
K
),
calculating (604) from the reflection coefficients (r
K
)
characteristics of cross-sectional

areas (A
K
) of cylinder portions of a
lossless tube modelling the first

speaker's vocal tract,
identifying the sounds by comparing (605) said characteristics of the cross-sectional
areas (A
K
) of the cylinder portions of the
lossless tube of the first speaker

with at least one previous
speaker's respective stored sound-specific characteristics

of cross-sectional areas (A
K
) of cylinder
portions of a lossless tube modelling said previous speaker's

vocal tract, and
providing the identified sounds with respective identifiers,
calculating (606) differences between stored characteristics
of the cross-sectional areas (A
K
) of the
cylinder portions of the lossless tube modelling the

first speaker's vocal tract for said sound and the
instantaneous parameters of a sample just arrived from the same speaker,
on the basis of the identifier of the identified sound, searching for (610) in a memory a second speaker's speaker-specific characteristics

of cross-sectional areas (A
K
) of cylinder
portions of a lossless tube modelling that second

speaker's vocal tract for the same sound
forming (613) a sum by summing said differences 
(617) and the second speaker's speaker-specific

characteristics (612) of the cross-sectional
areas of the cylinder portions of the lossless tube

modelling that second speaker's vocal tract for the same
sound,
calculating (614) new reflection coefficients
from that sum, and
producing (615) a new speech signal (616)
from said new reflection coefficients.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that a characteristic is calculated
(604) for the physical dimensions of the lossless

tube representing the same sound of the first speaker
and stored in a memory (608).
