<ABSTRACT>
A PABX switching network adapted to provide an interactive communication service to hotel guests comprises guest extension lines (4) each serving a telephone apparatus (3) located in individual guest rooms (2). The PABX system (1) is capable of interrogating a property management system (7) identifying the status of each guest room, and to couple a calling telephone apparatus (3) to an interactive call answering system (9) in order to provide a variety of call answering services to a hotel guest, depending upon the status of the guest room as indicated by the property management system (7). Each telephone station (3) incorporates a unique identify signal providing means that is capable of being interrogated by the PABX (1) in order to enable information from the property management system (7) to be coordinated to the individual hotel guest rooms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hotel interactive communication 
apparatus capable of responding to a call established from a 
guest room via a hotel telephone exchange system, in order to 
provide automatically, via the telephone exchange system, an 
information or other service demanded by the caller. There is known from Ericson Review Vol. 61, No.1, Stockholm SE, 
p-51-58, R. DIETSCH 'Hotel Communication System', a hotel 
communication apparatus comprising a PABX switching network 
providing a plurality of guest extension lines each coupled 
to a respective communication station provided in a guest 
room, and a property management system for storing room status 
information concerning each of a plurality of guest rooms 
served by said guest extension lines, each guest commumication 
station including signalling means operable by a caller for 
establishing a switched connection, via the PABX switching 
network. With the increasing sophistication of modern telephone 
exchange systems, it is becoming possible for a telephone 
exchange to provide to a caller a variety of services 
ancillary to the primary function of the exchange of 
establishing a switched telephone connection to a single party 
at a selected destination telephone line. Thus, a modern 
telephone exchange can provide for multi-party conference 
calls, so-called 'chat-lines', and a variety of information 
and entertainment services involving the replaying of recorded 
messages or selected audio entertainment. EP-A-0453831 
describes a system providing control of access to services of 
the exchange such as call answering based upon identity 
acknowledgement. A more recent innovation enables a calling 
party to select a conversation call to another unknown party 
selected from a pool of available participants based upon 
characteristic critera deemed by the calling party to be  
 
desirable in a party to be called. Such an innovation can be seen in FR-A-2 640 451. The present invention is based upon the concept that the 
temporary residents in a hotel at any given time represent a 
pool of potential calling parties to whom could be provided 
services of the kind available from a public telephone 
switching system, but which, in the context of the society 
represented by the transient population of a hotel, can be all 
the more valuable in that the services can be targeted at 
providing to a hotel guest, useful services hitherto 
unavailable in the hotel context. However, the provision of facilities such as the above in the 
context of a hotel

<CLAIMS>
A hotel communication apparatus comprising a PABX 
switching network (1) providing a plurality of guest extension 

lines (4) each coupled to a respective communication station 
(3) provided in a guest room, and a property management system 

(7) for storing room status information concerning each of a 
plurality of guest rooms (2) served by said guest extension 

lines (4), each guest communication station (3) including 
signalling means operable by a caller for establishing a 

switched connection, via the PBAX switching network (1) 
characterised in that said PABX network (1) further provides 

a plurality of interactive extension lines (8) each coupled 
to an interactive port of a call answering apparatus (9), that 

said property management system (7) has a room status port 
(13) capable of being interrogated by said call answering 

apparatus (9), that each guest communication station (3) can 
establish a connection via an interactive extension line (8), 

to said call answering apparatus (9) and further includes 
identity means individual to that station for providing via 

said switched connection a signal identifying the room served 
thereby; that said call answering apparatus (9) includes means 

responsive to establishment of such a switched connection for 
obtaining from the identity means of the calling station a 

corresponding identity signal, means for interrogating said 
property management system (7) to determine the status of the 

room corresponding to said identity signal and answering 
message sending means arranged to provide to the calling 

station a message dependent upon the determined status of said 
room, and that said call answering apparatus is further 

arranged to establish a pool of guest extension lines 
determined by selection criteria common to occupants of the 

corresponding guest rooms and to offer to a calling party the 
facility of establishing a one-to-one telephone connection 

with another extension line of said pool by the input of  
 

machining selection criteria. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein each said 
communication station comprises a DTMF telephone (3). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein each said 
communication station comprises a video text terminal. 
An apparatus according to any one of Claims 1-3, wherein 
said answering message sending means includes a first 

answering message module (22,23,25) arranged to send in 
response to determination of an invalid room status, a first 

answering message advising that a call cannot be completed and 
arranged to send, in response to determination of a valid room 

status, a second message inviting a caller to select one of 
a plurality of call answering services by transmitting a 

corresponding signal from the calling station. 
An apparatus according to Claim 4, further including a 
second answering message module (25,26,27,28) arranged to 

become enabled upon transmission of said second answering 
message and to respond to any one of a plurality of 

predetermined signals capable of being transmitted from the 
calling station by transmitting for each signal a 

corresponding answering message. 
An apparatus according to Claims 4 or 5, further 
including a message recording module arranged to become 

enabled upon transmission of said second answering message and 
to respond to a predetermined signal capable of being 

transmitted from the calling station.
