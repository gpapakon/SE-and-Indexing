<ABSTRACT>
There is provided an elongate sealing strip 
comprising an outer wall (10) for retaining and guiding a 

window (2) and an inner element (12) for attaching to a vehicle 
body flange, a carrier member (30) extending through the 

sealing strip to form a support for the outer wall (10) and 
the inner element (12), characterised in that said carrier 

member (30) comprises a rigid, imperforate part (31) in the said 
outer wall (10) and a separately formed, flexible, perforate 

part (32) extending through the remainder of the strip, 
adjacent end regions of the rigid and flexible parts 

being in cooperation with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an elongate sealing 
strip comprising a glass-run channel and an integral 
element for securing the strip to a flange around a 
window opening of a motor vehicle. EP-A-0307304 discloses a sealing element 
comprising integrated glass run channel and flange 
finisher portions. A common carrier extends throughout 
the sealing element. The common carrier is rigid and 
imperforate in the outer wall of the glass run channel 
portion and flexible and perforate within the remainder 
of the sealing element to enable it to be easily roll-formed 
and to avoid read-through of the carrier to the 
exterior surface of the outer wall. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an elongate sealing strip comprising an outer 
wall for retaining and guiding a window and an inner 
element for attaching to a vehicle body flange, a 
carrier member extending through the sealing strip to 
form a support for the outer wall and the inner 
element, wherein the carrier member comprises a rigid, 
imperforate part in the outer wall and a flexible, 
perforate part extending through the remainder of the 
strip (Elongate sealing strip of the type disclosed in EP-A-0 307 304); 
characterised in that the flexible perforate 
part is formed separately from the rigid imperforate 
part, with adjacent end regions of the rigid and 
flexible parts being in cooperation with each other. The end regions of the rigid and flexible parts 
may interlock and therefore cooperate directly. 
Alternatively, the end regions may cooperate 
indirectly, for example via an elastomeric section of 
the strip. The cooperating end regions of the rigid part and 
the flexible part each preferably terminate at a 
position in the region of the base of the outer wall. In one embodiment, the cooperating end region of 
the rigid part is crimped or otherwise formed onto the  
 
end region of the flexible part. For instance, the end 
region of the rigid part may be bent in order to form a 
gripping profile for gripping the end region of the 
flexible part. In another embodiment, the cooperating end region 
of the rigid part has a series of spaced apart 
projections adapted to engage corresponding recesses in 
the cooperating end region of the flexible part. 
Preferably, the projections are relatively short and 
evenly spaced. The corresponding recesses in the 
cooperating end region of the flexible part may be the 
recesses between alternate sprags of the perforated 
section. In a further embodiment, the cooperating end 
region of the

An elongate sealing strip comprising an outer 
wall (10) for retaining and guiding a window and an 

inner element (12) for attaching to a vehicle body 
flange, a carrier member (30) extending through the 

sealing strip to form a support for the outer wall (10) 
and the inner element (12), wherein the carrier member 

(30) comprises a rigid, imperforate part (31) in the 
outer wall (10) and a flexible, perforate part (32) 

extending through the remainder of the strip; 
characterised in that the flexible perforate part (32) 

is formed separately from the rigid imperforate part 
(31), with adjacent end regions of the rigid and 

flexible parts (31, 32) being in cooperation with each 
other. 
An elongate sealing strip according to claim 
1, wherein the end regions, (35, -) of the rigid and 

flexible parts (31, 32) interlock and therefore 
cooperate directly. 
An elongate sealing strip according to claim 
1, wherein the end regions cooperate indirectly. 
An elongate sealing strip according to claim 
3, wherein the end regions cooperate indirectly via an 

elastomeric section (46) of the strip. 
An elongate sealing strip according to claim 
1 or 2, wherein the cooperating end region of the rigid 

part is crimped or otherwise formed onto the end region 
of the flexible part. 
An elongate sealing strip according to claim 
1 or 2, wherein the cooperating end region of the rigid 

part (31) has a series of spaced apart projections (40) 
adapted to engage corresponding recesses (41) in the 

cooperating end region of the flexible part (32). 
An elongate sealing strip according to claim 
1 or 2, wherein the cooperating end region of the 

flexible part (32) is provided with a series of spaced  
 

apart projections, a proportion of which are offset to 
define a gap which receives the cooperating end region 

of the rigid part (31). 
An elongate sealing strip according to claim 

1 or 2, wherein the end regions of the flexible and 
rigid parts are planar and are bonded together. 
An elongate sealing strip according to claim 
4, wherein the end regions of the flexible and rigid 

parts cooperate indirectly via an elastomeric section 
of the strip, the adjacent ends being spaced apart and 

being capable of flexing with respect to each other, 
but being restrained from substantial movement by the 

rigidity of the elastomeric material. 
An elongate sealing strip according to claim 
9, wherein restraint of relative movement between the 

rigid and flexible parts is be increased by providing a 
region of elastomer of enhanced rigidity into which the 

end regions of the rigid and flexible parts are 
embedded. 
An elongate sealing strip according to any 
preceding claim, wherein the inner element of the 

elongate sealing strip of the present invention 
includes a wall which is substantially parallel to the 

said outer wall, and is connected to the outer wall by 
a base wall in order to define a glass run channel. 
Secured or otherwise fastened around the 
periphery of a motor vehicle window opening, a sealing 

strip in accordance with any one of the preceding 
claims.
