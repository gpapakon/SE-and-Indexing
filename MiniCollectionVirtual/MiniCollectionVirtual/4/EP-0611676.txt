<ABSTRACT>
Loading and unloading powered apparatus for trucks and the 
like comprising a support frame and a plurality of side by 

side slat conveyors (21) driven by a central electrical 
motor (9) and each of which comprises a pair of endless 

chains (18) with respective transverse pins protruding 
laterally (19) and a plurality of adjacent slats (20) 

formed on the respective sides thereof with pairs of

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to loading and 
unloading powered apparatus for trucks and the like. Apparatus of this kind are known in the art, which 
are constituted by permanent installations on board the 
truck or the like, employing ropes or chains over which 
the loads to be transferred inside or outside the truck 
or the like are directly bearing, or making use of belt 
conveyors constituted by endless or mutually 
articulated elements. These known apparatus are generally complicated and 
expensive to be manufactured and installed, are with 
difficulty adaptable to load surfaces having different 
width and length dimensions, and moreover involve 
problems (particularly in the case of vehicles provided 
with refrigerating equipment) related to periodic 
cleaning of the area comprised between the load 
platform of the truck or the like and the loading and 
unloading apparatus. A loading and unloading powered apparatus according 
to the pre-characterising portion of claim 1, i.e. 
employing side by side endless slat conveying chains, 
is known from WO 92/04263. In this known apparatus the 
slat conveyors are spaced apart from one another and, 
therefore, the loads to be handled are not supported 
over the entire base thereof. This constitutes a limit 
in connection with both stability of the loads during 
transportation, and flexibility of use of the apparatus 
with loads having different size.  
 The object of the present invention is to overcome 
the above drawbacks, and to provide a loading and 
unloading powered apparatus adapted to be manufactured 
in a relatively simple and economical way, constituted 
by modular elements which can be easily adapted during 
assembling to different user sizes, and further 
designed so as to make comfortable and convenient, in 
use, periodical cleaning operations of the load 
platform of the truck or the like. These objects are achieved by virtue of the 
features set forth in the characterising portion of 
claim 1. The recited construction of each slat conveyor is 
generally known per se from DE-A-3 828 914. The slat conveyors may conveniently be disposed so 
as to define a longitudinal separation zone aligned 
with said central portion of the first shaft. The driving engine, which is conveniently 
electrical, can be installed inside or outside the 
loading area of the truck or the like. In the case of 
outside installation, the central arrangement of the 
motor enables application thereof even onto 
semitrailers, without any problem of interference with 
the

<CLAIMS>
Loading and unloading powered apparatus for trucks 
and the like, comprising: 


a support frame (1) intended to be fixed 
horizontally onto a load platform (P) of a truck or the 

like and including a plurality of longitudinal members 
(2) connected to each other by transverse members (3), 
a plurality of side by side endless slat conveying 
chains (21) engaged onto a first and a second 

transverse shaft (6, 7) rotatably supported at the ends 
(4, 5) of the support frame (1), said slat conveying 

chains (18) having respective upper and lower runs 
(18a, 18b) guided along said longitudinal members (2), 

and 
a powered driving assembly of said slat conveying 
chains (21), including a motor (9) located adjacent to 

the first transverse shaft (6) and transmission means 
(11, 12, 13), 
 
characterised in that each of said slat conveying 

chains (21) comprises in a known way a pair of endless 
chains (18) having respective transverse pins 

projecting laterally (19) thereof, and a plurality of 
adjacent slats (20) formed at the respective opposite 

sides thereof with pairs of tubular bosses (27) within 
which said projecting transverse pins (19) of the two 

chains (18) are engaged, and further characterised in that 
said slats (20) are arranged 

so as to cover the entire surface of the load platform 
(P) but for a longitudinal central separation zone 

(22), and in that said transmission means (11, 12, 13) 
are arranged between said motor (9) and a central 

portion (8) of said first shaft (6), said central portion (8) of the 
first shaft (6) being aligned with said 

longitudinal separation zone (22). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said second transverse shaft (7) is divided into  

 
separate shaft portions (14) each of which has a width 

corresponding to that of a respective slat conveyor 
(21), and in that respective tensioning means (15) of 

the chains (18) of the corresponding slat conveyor (21) 
are associated to each of said shaft portions (14). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the tensioning means (15) comprise movable 

supports (5) of the said shaft portions (14) relative 
to the support frame (1), and associated screw and nut 

members for the positioning of the said movable 
supports (5). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the longitudinal members (2) are constituted by 

profiled elements having a horizontal base (29) for 
fixing thereof to the platform (P) of the truck or the 

like, an upper horizontal wing (31) formed with 
longitudinal grooves (33) along which respective guides 

(34) are fitted for the bearing of the upper runs (18a) 
of corresponding chains (18), a vertical rib (32) 

connecting the base (29) and the upper wing (31) 
therebetween and to which the said transverse members 

(3) of the support frame (1) are fixed, and a pair of 
lateral wings (36) projecting from opposite sides of 

the vertical rib (32) above the base (29) and defining 
therewith guides for the lower runs (18b) of respective 

chains (18). 
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the support frame (1) further comprises auxiliary 

longitudinal supports (28) interposed between each pair

having in cross section a substantially isosceles 
trapezoid shape with rounded corners, and having a 

shorter base (40) facing outwardly of the support frame 
(1) and a longer base (24) connected to the shorter 

base (40) through a pair of ribs (26) placed along the 
height of the trapezoid and formed with said tubular 

bosses (27). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that each slat (20) is formed in correspondence of the 

shorter base (40) thereof with a median substantially 
semi-circular groove (22) within which an antislip
