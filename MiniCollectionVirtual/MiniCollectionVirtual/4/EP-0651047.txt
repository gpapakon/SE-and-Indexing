<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to cleaner compositions for cleaning systems, for example in biotechnology and the foodstuff and beverage industry, such as filtration and bottling systems, heat exchangers and fermentation systems, consisting of a cleaning solution and a rinsing solution, characterised in that the cleaning solution contains a salt of an acylated sarcosine of the formula I, and an alkali metal or ammonium salt,

 is a singly charged cation, where the alkali metal or ammonium salt is selected from the group consisting of (NH4)2SO4, Na2SO4, K2SO4, sodium or potassium phosphate; and in that the rinsing solution contains at least one acid selected from the group consisting of phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, acetic acid and citric acid, and a water-miscible organic solvent. The invention furthermore relates to the use of these cleaner compositions in the cleaning of systems, for example in biotechnology and the foodstuff and beverage industry.
