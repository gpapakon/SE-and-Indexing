<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel ligands for dopamine receptors. More particularly, this invention is directed to certain substituted transhexahydrobenzo[a]phenanthridine compounds useful as dopamine-like agents or dopamine receptor blockers.Dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system ("CNS"), has been implicated in numerous neurological disorders. For example, it has been hypothesized that excess stimulation of dopamine receptor subtypes may be linked to schizophrenia. Additionally, it is generally recognized that either excessive or insufficient functional dopaminergic activity in the central nervous system may cause hypertension, narcolepsy, and other behavioral, neurological, physiological, and movement disorders including Parkinson's disease, a chronic, progressive disease characterized by an inability to control the voluntary motor system.It is generally accepted that there are at least two pharmacological subtypes of dopamine receptors (D-1 and D-2), each consisting of several molecular forms. While the physiological activities associated with the interaction with dopamine with those respective receptor subtypes are not fully understood, it is known that ligands exhibiting selectivity for activation/blockade with one or the other of the receptor subtypes produce more or less predictable, neuropharmacological results. CNS drugs exhibiting affinity for the dopamine receptors are generally classified not only by their receptor selectivity, but further by the character of their receptor interaction, i.e., by their agonist (receptor stimulating) or antagonist (receptor blocking) activity. More recently, it has been suggested that dopamine receptor ligands may further be characterized by selectivity for either presynaptic or postsynaptic receptors. As the neuropharmacological effects caused by association of selective ligands (agonist vs. antagonist) with specific receptor subtypes becomes better understood, drug researchers will be much better positioned to design CNS drugs targeting specific neurological or psychiatric disorders. Drugs with the ability to selectively block or stimulate D-1 or D-2 dopamine receptors are of significant interest in the CNS medical research community.The present invention provides novel C2, C3, and/or C4-substituted trans-5,6,6a,7,8,12b-hexahydrobenzo[a]phenanthridines. They are related generally to the compounds described in co-owned U.S. Patent No. 5,047,536, issued September 10, 1991, including particularly the compound
