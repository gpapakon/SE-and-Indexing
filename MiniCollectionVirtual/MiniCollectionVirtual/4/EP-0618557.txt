<ABSTRACT>
In a device for transmitting information for road traffic between a fixed transmitter component, which is close to the carriageway, and a receiver arranged in the vehicle, the transmitter component transmits a coded identification information and the receiver of a vehicle which goes past the transmitter component shows the identification information in the vehicle. So that, in the case of simple energy supply of the transmitter component and little constructional outlay therefore, screening measures become unnecessary, the transmitter component (1) is built into the carriageway surface (12). The energy necessary for transmitting the identification information is received by the transmitter component (1) by the vehicle (13) which goes over it. The receiver (4, 15, 16) has an antenna arrangement (14) which is arranged in the bottom area of the vehicle (13), transmits the transmitter energy necessary for the transmitter component (1) to said transmitter component and receives the identification information transmitted by the transmitter component (1).
