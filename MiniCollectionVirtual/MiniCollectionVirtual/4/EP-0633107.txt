<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for dressing the spigot end of cast concrete pipes, which comprise a socket, a pipe
length and a spigot end, with the following features:


at least one tool support arm (59; 65; 66; 86, 90);
a rotary drive (57; 58; 64; 75; 76) for rotation of the concrete pipe relative to the tool
support arm;
tools (61, 81, 91, 92) for dressing the concrete pipe, which are fitted on the tool support arm
and include a dressing tool (61, 81) which is adapted at least for smoothing mechanical dressing

of the surface of the spigot end (2),
tool adjustment devices (53; 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73; 82, 83; 84, 85, 88) on the tool support
arm,

characterized in that,
the tools include a coating tool (91, 92) which forms a plastics application device with a
following smoothing device.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the application device comprises at least
one roller entrained on the tool support arm and/or an entrained, rotating brush as a smoothing

device.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the application device comprises at
least one tube (91) with nozzles (92), wherein the tube (91) is curved in accordance with the

shape of the spigot end (2) and the nozzles are directed on to the surfaces of the spigot end (2).
Apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the tool support arm has two
spring biased lever arms (65, 66), of which the one (65) is driven in rotation and the other lever

arm (66) is pivoted on the first and carries a tool (61) at its end.
Apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the adjustment device (82, 83,
84, 85, 88) is designed for adjustment of the dressing tool (81) both axially and radially.
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that the dressing tool (81) consists of a frustro-conical
cutting or grinding wheel, which can be guided to form an undercut shoulder (17) of the

spigot end (2). 
Apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the tool support arm (59; 65,
66; 86, 90) can be driven around the spigot end (2).
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that the a centring cone (56) is arranged coaxial
with the axis of rotation of the tool support arm (59; 65; 66) and engages in the pipe bore of the

spigot end (2) to be dressed.
Apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the dressing tool is in the form
of a profile grinding wheel (61) for grinding the surface (11) of the spigot end (2) of the concrete

pipe.
