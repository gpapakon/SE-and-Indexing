<ABSTRACT>
Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is prepared by continuous gas-phase reaction of carbon monoxide and methyl nitrite on a heterogeneous catalyst containing a platinum metal at 50 to 170 DEG C and 1 to 5 bar. The reaction product is subjected to a multi-stage work-up which contains the following steps:   1. The reaction product is separated into gaseous and liquid fractions in a scrubber/condenser; the gaseous fractions are fed back for the new formation of methyl nitrite and the liquid fractions are subjected to a distillative work-up. 2. In the first distillation stage carried out at 5 to 15 bar DMC is obtained as bottom effluent. The top product is subjected to a second distillation stage or a pervaporation or vapour permeation. 3.1 In the second distillation stage carried out at 0.2 to 1.5 bar methanol is obtained as bottom effluent which can be subjected to the new formation of methyl nitrite. The top product of the second distillation stage is again subjected to the first distillation stage. 3.2 Alternatively to 3.1, in the pervaporation or vapour permeation a permeate is obtained which essentially consists of methanol and can be subjected to the new formation of methyl nitrite, and a retentate which is fed back into the first distillation.

Process for the continuous preparation of dimethyl 
carbonate from carbon monoxide and methyl nitrite 

and for recycling the nitrogen oxide thereby formed 
for renewed formation of methyl nitrite, characterized 

in that 

(a) carbon monoxide and methyl nitrite are reacted 
in the gas phase in the presence of a heterogeneous 

catalyst comprising a platinum metal, 
preferably a supported catalyst comprising 

palladium, and an inert gas in the temperature 
range from 50 to 170째C, preferably from 70 to 

150째C, and in the pressure range from 1 to 
5 bar, preferably 2-4 bar, wherein hydrogen 

halide, halogen, methyl chloroformate and/or 
other halogen-containing substances which have 

an activating effect under the reaction conditions 
are added as activator in a concentration 

of 0-3000 ppm, preferably 10-1000 ppm, to the 
gas mixture, 
(b) the mixture obtained in (a) is separated into 
gaseous and liquid reaction products, a portion 

of 0.7% by weight, preferably 0.1-5% by weight, 

of the gas stream is withdrawn, the low boilers 
present therein are separated off and supplied, 

if desired, to a subsequent reprocessing stage, 
the nitrogen monoxide present therein is 

reacted with oxygen and methanol to form methyl 
nitrite, which is separated off and recycled to 

the process, and the remaining accumulated, 
inert gases are removed from the process,  

 
(c) the gaseous products are reacted with methanol, 
oxygen and if appropriate freshly added nitrogen 

oxide or nitrogen oxide equivalents for 
renewed formation of the methyl nitrite, the 

gas mixture which contains the newly formed 
methyl nitrite being led off and recycled again 

to the preparation of dimethyl carbonate, and 
water and any other liquid by-products formed 

also being led off and removed from the circulation, 
preferably after subsequent recovery of 

the useful substances contained therein, and 
(d) the liquid products from (b) are subjected to 
separation by distillation, in which the entire 

product mixture is initially subjected to a 
first distillation, which is carried out under 

a pressure of 1 to 25 bar, preferably 1 to 
12 bar, and then either 
(e1) the top product from the first distillation is 
fed to another distillation carried out under 

a pressure of 200 to 1500 mbar, in which a 
methanol-rich discharge is obtained as the 

bottom product, which is recycled to the preparation 
of dimethyl carbonate, preferably to the 

component step for renewed formation of the 
methyl nitrite, and in which a top product is 

obtained which is recycled again to the first 
distillation, if appropriate together with 

other return streams, or 
(e2) the top product from the first distillation is 
fed to a pervaporation or a vapour permeation, 

which is operated on the retained material side 
at a temperature of 20 to 150째C under a pressure 

of 0.2 to 10 bar and on the permeate side 
at a temperature of -30 to +30째C under a pressure 

of 0.5-500 mbar, in which a methanol-rich 
outflow is obtained as the permeate, which is 

recycled to the preparation of dimethyl carbonate, 
preferably to the component step for 

regeneration of the methyl nitrite, and in
