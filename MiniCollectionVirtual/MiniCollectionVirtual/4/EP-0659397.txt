<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the direct dyeing of keratinous fibres, which consists in bringing keratinous fibres, to which a composition containing at least one natural dye has been applied, into contact with a gas containing water vapour, the temperature of the aforementioned gas being above 75 DEG C and the contact time between the aforementioned gas and the aforementioned fibres to be dyed being less than two minutes. According to the invention, the hair is dyed uniformly over the whole of the head from the roots to the ends, irrespectively of the state of the individual hairs.

<CLAIMS>
Cosmetic process for the direct dyeing of
keratinous fibres, which consists in bringing keratinous

fibres, to which has been applied a composition
containing at least one natural dye, i.e. any dye whose

structure exists per se in nature or whose structure is
derived from the hydrolysis or oxidation of a natural

precursor product, and which is obtained either by
synthesis or from organisms which produce it or from

plants containing it, into contact with a gas containing
water vapour, characterized in that the temperature of

the said gas is greater than 75°C and that the contact
time between the said gas and the said fibres to be dyed

is less than two minutes.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the gas is at a temperature greater than or equal to

85°C.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the gas is at a temperature between 85 and 150°C.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the gas is brought into

contact with the fibre to be dyed for a period ranging
from 0.01 second to 2 minutes.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the gas is brought into contact with the fibre to be

dyed for a period ranging from 0.01 second to 30 seconds.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the gas is brought into contact with the fibre to be

dyed for a period ranging from 1 second to 10 seconds.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that application of the gas is 

repeated several times on the same fibre.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the gas exclusively

contains water vapour.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the gas contains water vapour and

at least one other compound in gas or vapour form.
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the gas contains water vapour and air.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the natural dyes are chosen

from hydroxylated quinones, indigoids, hydroxyflavones,
santalins A and B, isatin and its derivatives, and

brasilin and its hydroxylated derivative.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the natural dyes are

present in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10% by
weight relative to the total weight of the composition.
