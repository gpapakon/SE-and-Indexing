<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a polyolefinic multilayer film which comprises a base layer containing polypropylene, and at least one outer layer. The outer layer contains a low-crystallinity C3/C4-olefin resin composition and has a minimum heat-sealing temperature of less than 84@C. The invention also relates to a process for the production of the multilayer film and to the use of the film.

<CLAIMS>
A biaxally orientated polyolefinic multi-layer film comprising a base layer which
contains polypropylene and at least one outer layer characterised in that the outer layer

contains at least 70 to 100% by weight, in relation to the weight of the outer layer, of low
crystalline C
3
/C
4
-copolymer with a C
3
 content of 60 to 85% by weight and a C
4
 content
of 15 to 40% by weight respectively related to the copolymer, the outer layer having a sealing

minimum temperature of less than 84°C while the thickness of the outer layer amounts
to 0.4 to 1.5 µm.
A multi-layer film according to claim 1, characterised in that the minimum sealing
temperature is in the range from 60 to 80°C and the copolymer has a melting temperature

of less than 130°C and preferably 105 to 120°C.
A multi-layer film according to claim 1 and/or 2, characterised in that the
copolymer has a recrystallisation temperature of less than 80°C, preferably 55 to 70°C, and

a melting enthalpy of 
<
67 J/g and preferably 50 to 60 J/g.
A multi-layer film according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the copolymer comprises a propylene content of 70 to 80 mol%, preferably 75 mol% and

a butene-1 content of 20 to 30 mol% and preferably 25mol%, respectively related to the
copolymer.
A multi-layer film according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that
it is transparent.
A multi-layer film according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that
it is opaque. 
A multi-layer film according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that
the base layer contains an anti-static agent, preferably tertiary aliphatic amine, while the

outer layer contains an anti-blocking agent, preferably SiO
2
 having a particle size of 4 to
6 µm.
A method of producing the multi-layer film according to claim 1 in which the melts
corresponding to the individual layers of the film are coextruded through a flat nozzle, a

coextruded film is drawn off over a pull-off roll, the temperature of which is between 10
and 90°C, the film is biaxially stretched with a longitudinal stretching ratio of 4:1 to 7:1

and a transverse stretching ratio of 6:1 to 11:1, the biaxially stretched film is heat-set,
possibly corona treated and then wound up.
