<ABSTRACT>
This method is characterized in that it includes the steps of keeping a surface of a solid material, such as 
a synthetic resin, glass, a metal and a ceramic material in contact with a liquid compound or a compound solution, 

applying rays of light selected from ultraviolet rays, visible rays of light and infrared rays to an interface between the 
surface of the solid material and liquid compound or compound solution so as to optically pump the surface of the 

solid material and the liquid compound or compound solution, subjecting the chemical species in the liquid compound 
or compound solution to substitution, and accumulating chemical species or carrying out an etching operation using 

the chemical species. This method preferably includes the steps of bringing a transparent window member into 
close contact with the surface of a solid material to be treated, interposing a thin layer of a liquid compound or 

compound solution between the solid material and window member by utilizing a capillary phenomenon, and applying 
ultraviolet rays, visible rays or light or infrared rays to the resultant product through the transparent window member. 

This treatment enables the irradiated portion to have hydrophilic property, adhesive property, printability, corrosion 
resistance and conductivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of photochemically
modifying a solid surface, to an adhesion method
and a marking method using this modification method, and
an apparatus for carrying out these methods.In the WO-A-91 14 730 there is disclosed that an organic
modifier is brought into contact with a polymer surface,
followed by irradiating the polymer surface with light
capable of being absorbed by the organic modifier so as
to modify the sample surface.There are known a method in which for the purpose of
modifying the surface of a fluoroplastic which is 
difficult to adhere because of its small affinity for
other substances, a fluoroplastic is immersed in a
treatment solution comprising liquid ammonia or naphthalene
containing metal sodium and tetrahydrofuran to
modify the surface, as well as a method of chemically
modifying the surface of a polyethylene or polypropylene
resin, which is chemically inactive and therefore
difficult to directly print or adhere, by dipping into a
mixed solution of potassium dichromate with concentrated 
sulfuric acid.Unfortunately, these conventional chemical
modification methods have problems that, in the case of
a fluoroplastic, for example, the surface of a
fluoroplastic material turns brown to make the surface
layer brittle, resulting in peeling of the adhesive
layer. Consequently, no satisfactory adhesive strength
can be obtained. In addition, although the above conventional
methods can modify an entire portion which is
immersed, they cannot perform partial modification
unless a photoresist is used as a mask. Also, the
treatment reaction is difficult to control, and
dangerous chemicals must be used.There are some other known methods, such as
sputtering, corona discharge, and plasma processing,
by which the surface of a fluoroplastic or the like is
physically modified. However, because of the lack of
chemical affinity for an adhesive, a roughened surface
formed acts as a stress concentration point, bringing
about bonding breakdown. This makes it impossible to
obtain a high bonding strength.A polymeric porous membrane or film made from a
fluoroplastic, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or
polyvinylidene fluoride, or from a polyethylene or
polypropylene resin is being used as a filtering
membrane in precision filtration and ultrafiltration of
liquids such as chemicals, foods, and water. Several
methods are known as a means for imparting hydrophilicity
to these porous membranes in order to improve the
rate of permeation of liquids. Examples are a method of
coat
