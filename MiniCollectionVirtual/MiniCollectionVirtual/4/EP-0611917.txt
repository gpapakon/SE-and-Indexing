<ABSTRACT>
The luminaire has inside a luminaire housing (1) a luminaire chamber (2) whose luminaire opening (5) is closed with respect to the interior of the baking oven (12) by a transparent cover (13) which bears on the luminaire housing (1) with a sealing element in a vapour-proof manner. According to the invention, the sealing element is formed by metal spring side pieces (19) which are connected to the glass plate (14) of the cover (13), extend around the luminaire opening (6) and are supported on an edge flange (5) of the luminaire housing.

<CLAIMS>
Lamp for baking ovens, in particular for baking ovens with pyrolytic 
self-cleaning, with a lamp housing, which is fastened in an oven wall 

and in the lamp chamber of which a lamp holder is disposed, as well as 
with a removable transparent cover which covers the lamp opening of the 

lamp chamber and is covered in vapour-tight manner relative to the lamp 
housing by a metallic sealing element, characterised thereby, that the 

sealing element is formed by metallic spring cheeks (19), which 
surround the lamp opening (6) and which are connected with the cover 

(14) and are integral components of a metallic frame (15) firmly 
connected with the cover (14). 
Lamp according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the metallic 
frame (15) furthermore comprises resilient detent elements (21), which 

detent with counterdetent elements (22) at the lamp housing (1), as 
integral components. 
Lamp according to claim 2, characterised thereby, that the metallic 
frame (15) comprises resilient centring elements (21), which are 

distributed at the circumference of the frame, as integral components. 
Lamp according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the metallic frame (15) comprises extensions (17), which 

are bent into U-shape and encompass the rim (rim edges 18) of the glass 
plate (14), at at least two mutually opposite frame limbs.
