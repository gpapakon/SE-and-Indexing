<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for decompacting soil comprises a hand-held probe (2) including a portion (8) which is to be driven into the soil and defines a gas passage extending along its length which communicates with one or more holes (18) opening out through the surface of the probe and with a low-pressure gas tank (32) via a first valve (46), the low-pressure gas tank communicating with a high-pressure gas tank (64) via a second valve (44). The probe (2) includes an abutment (12) and a second portion (10) on which a hammer (20, 24) is slidably received. The hammer includes a handle (24) by which it may be manually reciprocated vertically to strike the abutment to drive the first portion (8) into the soil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for
decompacting soil and is concerned with that type of
apparatus which comprises a hand-held probe including a
first portion which is to be driven into the soil, the
said portion of the probe defining a decompacting gas
passage extending along its length which communicates
with one or more holes opening out through the surface
of the probe and with a decompacting gas tank via a first
valve, the decompacting gas tank communicating with a
source of compressed decompacting gas via a second valve,
the probe including an abutment, a hammer being arranged
to be reciprocated vertically to strike the abutment to
drive the first portion into the soil. Such apparatus
operates by injecting a compressed gas into the soil
which breaks up its structure and creates cracks and
voids thereby decompacting it.It is known that one of the factors which influences
the vigour of plant growth and crop yields is the degree
of compaction of the soil. If the soil has become very
compacted, the access of oxygen and other gases to the
underlying soil is restricted thereby retarding
biological processes and the permeation of water and
nutrients from the surface. It is, therefore, desirable
periodically to decompact soil which has become
excessively compacted.Known apparatus for decompacting soil comprises a
wheeled trolley carrying a compressor, a receiver, a gas
probe and means for automatically advancing the probe a
short distance into the soil. In use, the compressor is
operated until a predetermined pressure is reached in the
receiver. A valve is then operated manually whereafter 
the probe is advanced into the soil and the compressed
air in the receiver is released into the soil through a
passageway and one or more holes formed in the probe.
This apparatus is both heavy and cumbersome and also
expensive. It can not be used on sloping ground and has
no facility for adjusting the pressure of the gas which
is injected into the soil. It will be appreciated that
adjustment of the gas pressure is desirable in order to
accommodate differing soil types and degrees of
compaction.Apparatus for decompacting soil of the type referred
to above is disclosed in GB-A-2144961. This apparatus
includes a hand held probe which defines a gas passage
extending along its length which communicates with holes
opening out through the surface of the probe and with a
compressed air tank. A compressed air driven hammer is
arranged to drive the probe into the ground. The
compressed air hammer is controlled by a
