<ABSTRACT>
An alternative resonant circuit configuration which reduces the amount of 
RF current that is switched by the power-stage transistors of a T/R unit and 

thereby also significantly reduces the reliability risk is disclosed. A parallel 
resonant antenna configuration of coils and capacitors reduces the RF current 

through the output stage push-pull transistor configuration to a small fraction of 
the RF current experienced by typical series resonant circuits. This circuit offers 

advantages of low cost, reliable impedance matching while reducing the volume 
necessary to perform the function.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to antenna circuits, suitable for high and
low power applications, which do not require use of transformers.To remotely charge up a transponder in a RF identification system, the
transmit/receive (T/R) unit must transmit a high magnetic field strength. A
magnetic field instead of an electric field is used because the energy density is
much higher than an in electrical field. The principle at work can be compared
to a simple transformer with the T/R unit coil being the primary part and the
transponder coil being the secondary part. The magnetic field couples to the
transponder from the T/R unit with a large air gap in between. In view of the
above description, a magnetic field may be generated with a series combination
of a simple coil and generator. However, with this configuration, a high field
strength is only generated if many windings are used, because the magnetic field
is proportional to the number of windings.Therefore, in order to generate high currents, resonance is used and a
series capacitor can be added to the generator/coil configuration of the T/R unit.
In an ideal series resonance circuit, with a high quality factor, the voltage drop
at the antenna(coil) and thus the current through the antenna is multiplied by
the quality factor, Q. A Q of 100, for example, generates a voltage at the
antenna that is 100 times the value applied to the resonance circuit and the
current is multiplied by the same value. In this way, high currents yielding high
magnetic field strengths are generated. This magnetic field is oftentimes generated by either a series or parallel
resonant circuit in the T/R unit. When an AC voltage with the resonant
frequency is applied to the tuned antenna circuit, the resonant circuit behaves as
a very low ohmic resistance, i.e. the D.C. resistance of the antenna coil, allowing
the coil of the resonant circuit to efficiently transmit the energy applied. At
resonance, an ideal series resonant circuit will appear to the output stage to be a
short circuit (impedance = 0 ohms) which could cause damage to the output
stage. Therefore, the driver circuit must have the capability to drive this low
impedance. A transformer can be used to adapt the power-stage of the T/R unit
to the low impedance of the resonance circuit, to protect the driver circuit and
determine the amount of power that is transferred to the resonator circuit via
the ratio of windings. If a transformer is not used, the minimum allowed D.C.
resistance of the antenna coil must be specified
