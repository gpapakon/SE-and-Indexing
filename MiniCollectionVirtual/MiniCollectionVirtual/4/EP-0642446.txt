<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for providing a transport or storage structure with a remote-readable escort memory. The escort memory (7) is first arranged in connection with a protective housing (8) protecting the escort memory (7). Initial closing of the escort memory (7) is performed by closing the protective housing (8) protecting the escort memory, and final closing of the escort memory (7) is performed by injection moulding: the initially closed protective housing (8) that contains the escort memory (7) is fully or in part encapsulated by injection mouldable plastic used for forming a wall (14) for the transport or storage structure (13), and the protective housing (8) and the escort memory (7) are integrated into the wall (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
Method for providing a transport or storage structure with a remote-readable escort memory and a transport or storage structureThe invention relates to a method for providing a transport or storage structure with a remote-readable escort memory, the structure being produced by injection moulding from plastic. In previously known methods an escort memory encapsulated e.g. in an epoxy cup is attached e.g. by adhering or screwing to a finished injection moulded transport or storage structure that is to be identified, e.g. to a box, vessel, pallet or the like. These and other methods of the prior art have several disadvantages and defects. The principle - and weakness - of known solu¬ tions is that an escort memory is to be arranged in a product that has already been produced, e.g. in a plastic box, that is to be identified by the escort memory. The known methods are also laborious in the production. In addition, the outer dimensions of transport or storage structures, such as boxes, produced by known methods may change and this may complicate the treatment of the box e.g. on the production line. In known solutions the identifier or escort memory can be detached from the product to be identified without breaking the product. This is especially disadvantageous when the escort memory is used for marking valuable or otherwise important products, since e.g. in case of theft it is more difficult to verify the original owner of the product if the escort memory has been detached from the product.The object of the present invention is to provide a new kind of method eliminating the problems of the known solutions. 

 This is achieved with the method of the inven¬ tion, which is characterised in that the escort memory is first arranged in connection with a protective housing protecting the escort memory, that initial closing of the escort memory is performed by closing the protective housing protecting the escort memory, that final closing of the escort memory and the protective housing is performed by injection moulding: the initially closed protective housing that contains the escort memory is fully or in part encapsulated by injection mouldable plastic used for forming a wall for the transport or storage structure, and the protective housing and the escort memory are integrated into the wall. The method of the invention is based on the idea that the escort memory is integrated into the product to be identified during the production.Several advantages are achieved with the method of the invention.

Claims
1. A method for providing a transport or storage structure with a remote-readable escort memory, the structure being produced by injection moulding from plastic, c h a r a c t e r i s e d in that the escort memory (7) is first arranged in connection with a protective housing (8, 8a, 8b) protecting the escort memory (7), initial closing of the escort memory (7) is performed by closing the protective housing (8) protecting the escort memory, and final closing of the escort memory (7) and the protective housing is performed by injection moulding: the initially closed protective housing (8) that contains the escort memory (7) is fully or in part encapsulated by injection mouldable plastic used for forming a wall (14) for the transport or storage structure (13), and the protective housing (8, 8a, 8b) and the escort memory (7) are integrated into the wall (14).
2. A method of claim 1, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i s e d in that the initially closed protective housing (8, 8a, 8b) containing the escort memory (7 ) is disposed in the mould (15) used in the injection moulding of the transport or storage structure (13), in the space (18) defined by the mould (15, 15a, 15b), the space being filled with molten plastic in the injection moulding and thereby forming the wall (14) of the structure. 3. A method of claim 2, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i s e in that the wall (14) of the injection moulded transport or storage structure (13) is injection moulded to be essentially on a level with at least one of the outer surfaces (8c, 8d) of the protective housing (8, 8a, 8b) containing the escort memory (7). 


 4. A method of claim 1, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i s e d in that before initial closing of the protective housing (8, 8a, 8b), the protective housing (8, 8a, 8b) is filled with a filling agent, such as polyurethane, epoxy or silicone.
5. A transport or storage structure, such as a box, vessel, container, pallet or the like, that is provided with a remote-readable escort memory and injection moulded from plastic, the structure comprising an injection moulded wall (14) and a remote-readable escort memory and being used for identifying the transport or storage structure (13), c h a r a c t e r - i s e d in that the escort memory (7) is encapsulated by a protective housing (8) that is in essentially one part but comprises two elements (8a, 8b) facing each other at the joint (9) formed in initial closing, and that the protective housing (8) with the escort memory (7) contained therein is integrated into the wall ( 14) of the injection moulded transport or storage structure (13), and that the injection moulded plastic in the wall (14) is arranged to perform final closing of the joint (9) between the opposite elements (8a, 8b) of the protective housing (8 ) . 6. A transport or storage structure of claim

10. A transport or storage structure of claim 9 provided with a remote-readable escort memory and injection moulded from plastic, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i s e d in that the protective housing (8, 8a, 8b) of the escort memory (7) also comprises press-on connecting means (23, 24) provided on the inside of the protective housing (8), in the opposite elements (8a, 8b) of the protective housing (8) .
11. A transport or storage structure of claim 5 provided with a remote-readable escort memory and injection moulded from plastic, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i s e d in that at least one of the opposite elements (8a, 8b) of the protective structure (8) for the escort memory (7) is injection moulded to be on a level with the wall ( 14 ) of the transport or storage structure (13).
