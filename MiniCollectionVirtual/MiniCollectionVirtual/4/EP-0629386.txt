<ABSTRACT>
A total hip replacement type artificial joint 
comprising a stem (1) and a socket (16), the stem (1) being 

provided with a ball (10) at the upper end thereof and 
comprising a porous portion (3) as an upper portion, a 

protector (6) located under and along the porous portion (3) 
and at the same height as the porous surface of the porous 

portion (3), an intermediate portion (4) which underlies the 
porous portion (3) and which is trapezoidal in section, and a 

lower portion (5) which underlies the intermediate portion (4) 
and which is circular in section, and the socket (16) 

comprising an outer cup (2) and a protector (8), the protector (8) 
being provided along the outer peripheral edge of the 

outer cup (2) and at the same height as a porous surface (7) 
formed on the outer surface of the outer cup (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an artificial 
joint to be implanted into a human body after resection 
of an abnormal part in the case where the abnormal part 
is found in a bone such as the hip joint or the knee 
joint of the human body. For example, as to the hip joint, as shown in Fig. 
4, a total hip replacement type prosthesis comprises a 
stem 1 and a socket 16, the stem 1 having a head 10 at 
the upper end thereof. When this prosthesis is 
implanted into the body of a patient, the stem 1 is 
embedded in intramedulla of femur 14 side, while the 
socket 16 on a pelvis 17 side. In many cases, the 
socket 16 comprises an outer cup (metal back) 2 which 
comes into contact with a living body bone and an inner 
cup 11 formed of a high density polyethylene and serving 
as a rotative slide surface with respect to the head 10. 
The outer cup 2 embedded in the pelvis 17 is fixed to 
the acetabulum with screws 12. As long as there does 
not occur any trouble, the stem and the socket remain  
 
embedded in the living body for a long period or during 
existence of the patient. For their replacement, a 
large-scale surgical operation is needed. Therefore, it 
is desirable that there occur no trouble after an 
initial operation. According to the present stage of technical level, 
however, a limit is encountered in the duration of 
normal function of an artificial joint because it is the 
artificial joint that is embedded in the living body. 
There are a very large number of cases where even if the 
artificial joint exhibits its normal function just after 
the operation for embedding thereof, a trouble occurs 
with the lapse of 15 to 20 years. Of course, there are 
not a few cases where a trouble occurs in a shorter 
period due to some trouble of the artificial joint 
itself or due to a poor operation technique. One serious trouble with the artificial hip joint 
or knee joint is loosening. This is a phenomenon such 
that the connection between a prosthesis and a living 
body bone becomes loose upon lapse of a certain period 
after a surgical operation. Once this phenomenon 
occurs, the patient will suffer pain, and there will 
occur wobbling of the joint to the extent that the 
artificial joint can no longer stand use.  For preventing the occurrence of such loosening 
over as long a period as possible after the surgical 
operation, it is important to improve the operation 
technique and make an appropriate design of the 
artificial joint itself. Although various improvements 
have been made and ample care

<CLAIMS>
An artificial joint including a stem (1), said 
stem comprising a porous portion (3) as a proximal 

portion, a protector (6) located under and along said 
porous portion and at the same height as the porous 

surface of the porous portion, an intermediate portion (4) 
which underlies said porous portion and which is 

trapezoidal in section, and a distal portion (5) which 
underlies said intermediate portion and which is circular 

in section. 
An artificial joint including a socket (2), said 
socket comprising an outer cup and a protector (8), said 

protector being provided along the outer peripheral edge 
of said outer cup and at the same height as a porous 

surface (7) formed on the outer surface of the outer cup. 
A total hip replacement type artificial joint 
comprising a stem (1) and a socket (2), said stem being 

provided with a ball (10) at the upper end thereof, 
characterized by the stem being defined as in claim 1 and
