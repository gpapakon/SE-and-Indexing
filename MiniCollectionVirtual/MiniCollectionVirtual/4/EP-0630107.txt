<ABSTRACT>
A load stage comprises a first transistor (M1) whose channel is connected 
between a first terminal (2) and a first node (8), a second transistor (M2) whose channel 

is connected between a second terminal (4) and a second node (10), a third transistor 
(M3) whose channel is connected between the first node (8), a third terminal (6), and a 

fourth transistor (M4) whose channel is connected between the second node (10) and the 
third terminal (6), and a switch (12) between the first (8) and the second (10) terminal. 

The gates of the first (M1) and the fourth (M4) transistor are connected to the first 
terminal (2). The gates of the second (M2) and the third (M3) transistor are connected 

to the second terminal (4). When the switch (12) is closed the first (M1) and the second 
(M2) transistor form a positive differential impedance between the first (2) and the 

second (4) terminal. When the switch (12) is open the cross-coupled third (M3) and 
fourth (M4) transistors form a negative differential impedance between the first (2) and 

the second (4) terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a load stage comprising: 
a first, a second and a third terminal; a first transistor having a gate, which is coupled to the first terminal, a source, a drain 
and a main current path between the source and the drain, which main current path is 
included in a current path between the first terminal and the third terminal; a second transistor having a gate, which is coupled to the second terminal, a source, a 
drain and a main current path between the source and the drain, which main current 
path is included in a current path between the second terminal and the third terminal; a third transistor having a gate, which is coupled to the second terminal, a source, a 
drain and a main current path between the source and the drain, which main current 
path is included in a current path between the first terminal and the third terminal; a fourth transistor having a gate, which is coupled to the first terminal, a source, a 
drain and a main current path between the source and the drain, which main current 
path is included in a current path between the second terminal and the third terminal; 
and switching means for selectively connecting the main current path of the first transistor 
and the main current path of the third transistor between the first and the third terminal 
and for selectively connecting the main current path of the second transistor and the 
main current path of the fourth transistor between the second and the third terminal. The invention also relates to a clocked comparator comprising such a load 
stage. Such a load stage is known from a paper by B.S. Song and M.F. 
Tompsett, "A 10b 15 Mhz Recycling Two-Step A/D Converter", published in the 
Digest of Technical Papers, 1990 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, 
pp. 158-159. The known load stage is used in a clocked comparator. In a first phase of 
a clock signal the comparator operates as a differential amplifier, the impedance of the 
load stage being positive. In a second phase of the clock signal the comparator operates 
as a latching circuit, the impedance of the load stage being negative. In the known load  
 
stage the first and the second transistor are connected as diodes and their sources can be 
connected to the third terminal by a switching transistor, said third terminal being 
connected to earth. The gates of the third and the fourth transistor are cross-coupled to 
the drains of the third and the fourth transistor and the sources are connected to the 
third terminal via a permanently
