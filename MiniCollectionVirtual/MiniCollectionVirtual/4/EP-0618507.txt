<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrophotographic
photoreceptor for liquid development and more particularly an
electrophotographic photoreceptor for use in copying machines
and photo printers utilizing liquid development for image
formation.Electrophotography has been steadily extending its
application in the fields of not only copying machines but
various printers because of rapid image formation and high
image quality. As an electrophotographic photoreceptor
(hereinafter simply referred to as a photoreceptor) which is
a kernel of electrophotographic techniques, inorganic
photoconductive materials, such as selenium, an arsenic-selenium
alloy, cadmium sulfide, and zinc oxide, have
conventionally been employed. In recent years, organic
photoconductive materials have been developed owing to their
advantages over inorganic ones, such as non-environmental
pollution, ease of film formation, ease of production, and
the like. Of the organic photoreceptors, so-called laminate
type photoreceptors composed of a charge generating layer and
a charge transporting layer have been chiefly studied.Laminate type photoreceptors are composed of a charge
generating material and a charge transporting material 
separately selected from the respective wide range so as to
exhibit high efficiency, they have higher sensitivity and
higher safety. Further, photoreceptors of this type are
economically advantageous because of high productivity in
coating operation. On account of these advantageous,
laminate type photoreceptors have been extensively developed
with expectation of taking the lead among various types of
photoreceptors.In the meantime, digitization in electrophotographic
hardware, such as reading elements, writing elements, image
processing devices, etc., has advanced rapidly with the aim
of improving image quality in terms of resolving power, half
tone reproducibility and the like. Along this line, it is
well known that liquid development is a powerful means for
accomplishing high image definition. As compared with dry
development, liquid development uses much finer toner
particles thereby realizing high resolving power and
satisfactory image reproduction. A liquid developer to be
used in liquid development generally comprises a highly
insulating medium (solvent) having dispersed therein toner
particles containing a dye or a pigment as a colorant and a
binder resin and having added thereto a charge control agent
to impart a prescribed charge quantity to the toner
particles. However, a liquid development system is
