<ABSTRACT>
An output circuit for a counter, in particular for a heat meter for the electrical remote interrogation of the heat meter state, in which a voltage supply which is necessary for the remote interrogation is applied by a device for remote interrogation which is to be connected to output connections (4), contains a resistor (5), and in parallel therewith a Darlington circuit (6), which are connected via a bridge rectifier (1) to the output connections (4). In this arrangement, the resistor (5) is connected to the output contacts (3) of the bridge rectifier (1), and the input contacts (2) of the bridge rectifier (1), via identical limiting resistors (8), to the output connections (4). The Darlington circuit (6) is controlled by a signal from the heat meter which is applied to the input connections (7). Because of the bridge rectifier (1), the circuit can have its poles interchanged. The advantages of this circuit consist in the fact that, with a low current consumption from the control current source (heat meter), it is very simple in terms of circuitry, the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with respect to disturbance signals is good and, in addition, that it can be produced economically.
