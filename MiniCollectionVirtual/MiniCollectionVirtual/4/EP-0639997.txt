<ABSTRACT>
An analogue display golf counter comprising, in a first embodiment thereof, four separate hands driven by four stepping motors. The hand positions are controlled by an electronic system comprising a counter, a store, a processor and a controller responding to programmed algorithms and data input via two push buttons. The first hand shows the position of the course (hole), the second shows the operating mode, and the last two show the score, i.e. one shows the units with the sign while the other shows the tens. Three operating modes are provided: "single score", "total score" and "programming". In the latter mode, a reference course may be programmed.

<CLAIMS>
Golf counter device provided to display data 
relating to a game of golf, in particular a number of 

points and a particular hole of a golf course, comprising 
manual inputting means (222,223) for introducing in 

particular a number of strokes and first selection and 
display means (10,21,22,23,24,25) able to be activated 

manually to select and display said particular hole, said 
device also comprising electronic counting, storing, 

processing and control means (44,45,48,49,60,52 etc.) to 
calculate and display a number of points, said number of 

points being according to a first operating mode of the 
device at least, calculated by taking account of said 

number of strokes introduced for each of the successively 
selected holes since the beginning of the game, said 

device being characterized in that it displays said data 
relating to a game of golf by means of hands (201,202,204, 

207,208,209) arranged to move above a dial and driven 
independently of each other by stepping motors (24,29, 

50,53) so as to cooperate with a plurality of scales 
(214,218,219,227), in that said first means for displaying 

a particular hole comprise a first of said hands (204) and 
a first of said scales (214), said first scale (214) 

comprising a plurality of positions which correspond 
respectively to different holes of a golf course, and in 

that said electronic means for displaying a number of 
points comprises at least a second hand (207,209) whose 

axis passes substantially through the centre of the dial 
and a second of said scales (217) which is concentric to 

the dial. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said electronic means for displaying a number of 

points comprises two co-axial hands (207,209) whoses axes 
pass substantially through the centre of the dial.  

 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said co-axial hands (207,209) are provided to 

indicate simultaneously the number of points corresponding 
to said particular hole (simple total) and the cumulative 

total. 
Device according to claim 3, characterized in 
that, in said first operating mode of the device, one of 

the centre hands displays the current number of points, 
whilst the other centre hands continue to display the 

number of points which was displayed when the player 
finished with the particular previously selected hole. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that once the number of strokes has been 

increased, a mobile organe visible on the dial changes its 
displacement mode during a predetermined period of time to 

indicate to the player that he has just introduced a 
stroke. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least one of said scales (217) 

comprises a negative sector. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said second scale (217) is carried 

by a rotating bezel, so as to enable the zero of said 
second scale to be staggered as desired so that said 

number of points displayed takes into account the model 
number of strokes for the course. 
Device according to claim 7, characterized in 
that said rotating bezel comprises a detachable ring 

carrying indications relating to a particular course. 
Device according to claim 8, characterized in 
that said detachable ring carries indications relating to 

a particular player. 
Analog display watch characterized in that it is 
combined with a golf counter device according to one or 

other of the preceding claims. 
Analog watch according to claim 10, characterized 
in that it comprises a time setting crown able to be moved  

 
axially between a neutral position and at least two active 

positions, and in that a first of said active positions 
enables the time to be set, whilst a second of said active 

positions enables a model number of strokes (or "PAR") to 
be introduced and stored for each hole of a course.
