<ABSTRACT>
A coil (6) forming part of a tuned circuit (8) is wound around a gapped magnetic core (2). As a magnetic stripe (14) is passed under core (2), variations to the amplitude and frequency of the circuit (8) occur dependent upon the magnetic data on the strip (14). Selected data are manipulated to derive several values for combination via AND-gate (46). Only if the combination value is above a threshold value is an indication given that the stripe (14) is genuine and not an attempted copy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of, and apparatus for, reading 
magnetically encoded information comprising: 
a gapped magnetic core; a coil wound upon the core and forming part of a tuned 
circuit; an oscillator for driving the tuned circuit at a frequency lying on its resonance curve; means for providing a first signal dependent upon the amplitude of signals occurring 
within the tuned circuit; and verification means for verifying the genuiness of the magnetically encoded 
information, which verification means comprises means for providing a second signal 
dependent upon the frequency of signals occurring within the tuned circuit. Substrates bearing magnetically encoded information are increasingly being used, for 
example, in point-of-sale or automated transaction applications. A known apparatus of the above general kind is described in our published UK 
patent number GB 2,035,659. In this apparatus the gapped core and associated coil are 
held just above and pass over a magnetic stripe. The magnetic stripe comprises alternate 
sections of permanently aligned ferrous oxide particles interspersed with sections of either 
differently aligned or randomly oriented ferrous oxide particles. The changes in magnetic 
permeability of the stripe in the different sections as the core passes over it induce 
variations in the frequency of the resonant circuit. A signal dependent on this frequency is 
used to determine whether the stripe under examination is genuine or not. Whilst the known apparatus operates in an entirely satisfactory manner, a system 
which offers improved discrimination performance over the prior art is an attractive 
proposition because of the more widespread use of substrates bearing such magnetically 
encoded information. According to one aspect of the present invention an apparatus as defined in the first 
paragraph is characterized by the verification means further comprising: 
means for deriving from the first signal a first plurality of output values representative of 
signal amplitude variations occurring within the circuit upon relative movement between 
the coil and the magnetically encoded information; means for deriving from the second signal a second plurality of output values representative 
of signal frequency variations occurring within the circuit upon relative movement 
between the coil and the magnetically encoded information, means for comparing at least one of the output values representative of signal 
amplitude variations and at least one of the output values
