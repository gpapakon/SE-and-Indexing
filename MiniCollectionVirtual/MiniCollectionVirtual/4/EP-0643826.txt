<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for cleaning the fuel injection system (12) of a vehicle without disassembling the fuel injectors (34) from the vehicle engine (14). The apparatus includes pump means (54) separate and apart from the vehicle for feeding fuel into the fuel supplying means (48), control means (58) for controlling the pump means, including means for operating said at least one fuel injector while said injector is disposed in operable association with said vehicle engine and means for operating the pump in a fuel feeding mode and in a fuel withdrawing mode whereby to retract fuel from the system, and means for operably associating said pump means with said fuel supplying means and disabling said fuel supplying means to permit said pump means to be the sole source of the fuel supply for said at least one fuel injector.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FUEL INJECTION CLEANING AND TESTING SYSTEM AND APPARATUSBackground and Summary of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to a device for cleaning the fuel injection system of an engine and measuring flow through the individual injectors, and in particular to a fuel injector cleaner and injector flow measurement device for the engine of an automotive vehicle.Fuel injected engines offer more performance, better mileage, and reduced exhaust emissions. These advantages are not without some disadvantages as fuel injectors are relatively expensive and sensitive both to fuel quality and fuel contamination. Further, fuel injectors are apt to gradually acquire deposits restricting the area of the fuel passage, which deposits can effect the fuel spray and thus the engine performance. It is typically not practicable to disassemble and discard expensive parts because of fuel quality or fuel contamination problems.Most major fuel producers have developed additives for their fuels that contain solvents and detergents to prevent deposit accumulation. This will not solve the problem with vehicles in which deposits were already present. Further, many of the independent fuel producers do not include additives due to the increased expense. Customers are prone to use less expensive fuels, especially in older vehicles that are out of warranty. Most of these cheaper fuels do not contain sufficient additives to be effective.To remove these deposits, apparatus has been proposed to clean the fuel injection system. Illustrative is GB 2117048, published October 5, 1983, the specification being specifically incorporated herein by reference. GB 2117048 disclose that a chemical additive is added to a separate tank which is connected to and forms the fuel source for the vehicle engine. The chemical is mixed and pressure fed to the fuel injector system in substitution for the regular vehicle fuel supply. Thus the engine runs on the cleaning fluid gas mixture. However, residue and foreign material 

removed from the carbon covered surfaces are not necessarily removed from the system. If not completely removed, such residual particles contaminate the system and eventually return to the fuel tank for deposit therein. For example, excess fuel passed through the fuel rail and not used by the injectors is returned to the tank. The above problems create a need for equipment to remove deposits and restore engine fuel injection system performance.Accordingly, it is an important object of the present invention to provide a

 Claims
1. An apparatus for cleaning and/or testing the fuel injection valve system of a vehicle engine, wherein sai apparatus defines an independent fuel system attachable t the vehicle engine so as to temporarily replace the engine' fuel system, the apparatus comprising: a fuel/chemical mixture tank having an outlet line an a return line in communication, respectively, with fue inlet and outlet ports of the engine for communicating fuel to one of the fuel injectors; fuel pump means, separate and apart from the vehicl engine, for pumping fuel/chemical mixture from said tan into the fuel inlet port of said engine; a fuel filter interposed in said fuel line and betwee the mixture tank and the fuel pump; a first sensor means, interposed between the pump an the filter, for detecting the fluid pressure drop across th filter during operation of the pump and generating a firs signal; a second sensor means, downstream of the pump, fo detecting the fluid pressure at the inlet to the engine an generating a second signal; and electronic control means for controlling the operatio of the pump during operation of the engine being cleaned, said control means including first circuit means, connected to the pump an responsive to said first signal, for operating the pump i a fuel feeding mode, and second circuit means, connected to the pump an responsive to said second signal, for operating the pump i a fuel retracting mode whereby to draw the cleaner flui back to the mixture tank via the outlet line, said first an second circuit means being connected in series with on another. 


 2. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said control means includes timer means for running the pump means a predetermined time.
3. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, further including flow measuring means for measuring the flow of fuel through each injector while the injector is operably secured to and associated with the engine, and pulse means for controlling the duration of fuel flow through the injector.
4. An apparatus for cleaning and/or testing the fuel injection system of a vehicle engine, the vehicle engine of the type including at least one fuel injector operably secured to and associated with the engine, fuel supplying means including an engine pump for supplying fuel to the fuel injector, injector controlling means for controlling the operation of the fuel injectors whereby to feed fuel to the engine cylinders associated with the injectors, and power means for powering the controlling means, the improvement comprising pump means separate and apart from the vehicle for feeding fuel into the fuel supplying means, control means for controlling the pump means, including means for operating said at least one fuel injector while said injector is disposed in operable association with said vehicle engine and means for operating the pump in a fuel feeding mode and in a fuel withdrawing mode whereby to retract fuel from the system, and means for operably associating said pump means with said fuel supplying means and disabling said fuel supplying means to permit said pump means to be the sole source of the fuel supply for said a least one fuel injector. 



 5. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the apparatus comprises flow measuring means for measuring the flow of fuel through each injection valve during the operation of the injection valve and while the injection valve is operably secured to and associated with said engine, and pulse means for controlling the duration of fuel flow through each injection valve.
6. A method of cleaning carbon deposits from the fuel injectors of vehicle engine having its fuel pump disabled and replaced by a carbon cleaning apparatus having an independent fuel pump and fuel system, said method comprising the steps of: disconnecting said engine pump from operable relation with said vehicle engine and plugging the inlet and return fuel lines of said engine, attaching an output and return fuel line of said independent fuel system to said engine to replace the fuel lines communicating with the engine's fuel injectors, presetting the fuel pressure of the apparatus, connecting a fuel/chemical mixture tank to said output and return lines of said independent fuel system, so as to define a fuel/chemical flow subsystem as required for transferring the mixture from said mixture tank to said engine, substantially simultaneously pumping fuel to said engine injectors and monitoring pressure drop through said input and output lines, the excess mixture fuel being returned to said mixture tank while said engine is operating, filtering the fuel/chemical mixture being discharged from said mixture tank, monitoring pressure drop through said filter, and discontinuing pumping when the pressure being monitored falls below a preselected value or when a desired flow of fuel has been measured. 


 7. The method as claimed in Claim 6 further comprising the steps of monitoring the pressure drop of the fuel into the engine, and reversing the pump and the direction of fuel flow when the pressure drop monitored at the engine inlet falls below a predetermined value, said pump drawing the excess fluid from the engine and apparatus and directing both through the filter and into the tank.
