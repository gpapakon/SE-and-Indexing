<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the removal of ink 
from printed wastepaper in the course of reclaiming the fibre 
content of the wastepaper for reuse in the manufacture of new 
paper. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
wastepaper deinking process which is carried out entirely at 
neutral or slightly acidic pH conditions. Wastepaper has long served as a source of the raw fibre 
materials used in making paper. Traditionally, fibre from wastepaper 
was utilised only in the production of low grade paper and 
paperboard products. Today, however, greater utilization of reclaimed 
fibre has provided incentive for taking steps to upgrade 
the reclaimed product. These steps include treatment to effectively 
remove ink from waste fibres in order to permit their use in the 
manufacture of newsprint and high quality papers. Because of its 
quantity, waste newsprint is a particularly important feedstock to 
such reclamation processes. In the course of the conventional paper reclamation process of 
interest, deinking procedures include steps for converting the 
wastepaper to pulp and contacting the pulp with an alkaline aqueous 
deinking medium containing a chemical deinking agent. The physical 
pulping and the alkalinity of the aqueous medium cause the partial 
removal of ink from the pulp fibre and the deinking agent completes 
this removal and produces a suspension and/or dispersion of the ink 
particles thus removed from the pulp. The resulting mixture is 
subsequently treated by flotation or washing to separate the 
suspended ink from the pulp. In most conventional deinking processes, the wash and/or 
flotation steps are carried out at alkaline pH, usually 8.5-10.5. 
Conducting the washing or flotation steps at alkaline pH is convenient 
because the fluid carried over from the pulping step is 
alkaline. In addition, many wash deinking and flotation deinking  
 
processes use fatty acids as surfactants and these fatty acids are 
capable of functioning as surfactants only when the aqueous medium 
is sufficiently alkaline to ionise them. It is known in the art, e.g. from EP-A-0 466 615, that the removal 
of ink from wastepaper 
can be accomplished by a deinking process in which the paper is 
reduced to pulp and the pulp is contacted with an aqueous medium 
containing a surfactant as a deinking agent. It is also known in 
the paper deinking art (for example, US-A-4,162,186) to 
employ chemical agents which are ethylene oxide adducts ("ethoxylates") 
of detergent-range alcohols or

<CLAIMS>
A process for the deinking of wastepaper stocks which 
comprises: 


a) converting the wastepaper to a pulp and contacting said pulp 
with an aqueous medium containing a surface-active deinking agent, 

and 
b) subjecting the resulting pulp-containing medium to one or 
more wash and/or flotation steps wherein said wash and/or flotation 

step is carried out at a pH of about 7 or less to remove suspended 
ink therefrom and to condition said pulp-containing medium for 

subsequent addition to a paper machine,
 
wherein said surface-active deinking agent is selected from the 

group consisting of alcohol ethoxylate compounds, alcohol propoxyethoxylate 
compounds and mixtures thereof. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said surface active deinking 
agent is an alcohol ethoxylate or alcohol propoxyethoxylate having a 

formula 

 
wherein R is a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl group having 

in the range of from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, or an alkylaryl group 
having an alkyl moiety having from 8 to 12 carbon atoms, m and n 

represent respectively the average number of oxypropylene groups and 
oxyethylene groups per molecule, for m is 0, n is in the range of 6 

to 20, and for m is in the range of from 0.5 to 7, n is in the range 
of from 1 to 20. 
The process of claim 2 wherein said surface active deinking 
agent is an alcohol ethoxylate or alcohol propoxyethoxylate wherein 

for m is 0, n is in the range of 7 to 15, or for m is in the range 
of 1 to 3, n is in the range of 2 to 12. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein said surface 
active deinking agent additionally comprises a C₈ to C₁₈ fatty acid. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the aqueous 
medium in step a) has a pH of about 7 or less.  

 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the aqueous 
medium in step a) has a pH in the range of from 3 to 7. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein said wash 
and/or flotation step is carried out at a pH in the range of from 3 

to 7. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein prior to step 
b), the resulting pulp-containing medium from step a) is: 


i) washed to removed additional ink, 
ii) bleached at a pH of from 9 to 12 using hydrogen peroxide, 
or at a pH of from 4 to 6.5 using sodium hydrosulphite, and 
iii) contacted with a surface active deinking agent selected 
from the group consisting of alcohol ethoxylate compounds, alcohol 

propoxyethoxylate compounds and mixtures thereof, at a pH of about 7 
or less. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the aqueous 

medium contains between 0.5 percent by weight and 12 percent by 
weight of pulp and step a) of the process is carried out at a 

temperature in the range of from 30 °C to 100 °C.
