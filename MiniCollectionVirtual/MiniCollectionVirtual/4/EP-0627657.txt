<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of water-soluble 
disulfide compounds in light-sensitive 
silver halide emulsions. Problems with fogging have plagued the 
photographic industry from its inception. Fog is a 
deposit of silver or dye that is not directly related 
to the image-forming exposure, i.e., when a developer 
acts upon an emulsion layer, some reduced silver is 
formed in areas that have not been exposed to light. 
Fog can be defined as a developed density that is not 
associated with the action of the image-forming 
exposure, and is usually expressed as "D-min", the 
density obtained in the unexposed portions of the 
emulsion. Density, as normally measured, includes both 
that produced by fog and that produced as a function of 
exposure to light. It is known in the art that the 
appearance of photographic fog related to intentional 
or unintentional reduction of silver ion (reduction 
sensitization) can occur during many stages of 
preparation of the photographic element including 
silver halide emulsion preparation, spectral/chemical 
sensitization of the silver halide emulsion, melting 
and holding of the liquid silver halide emulsion melts, 
subsequent coating of silver halide emulsions, and 
prolonged natural and artificial aging of coated silver 
halide emulsions. The control of fog, whether occurring during 
the formation of the light-sensitive silver halide 
emulsion, during the spectral/chemical sensitization of 
those emulsions, during the preparation of silver 
halide compositions prior to coating on an appropriate 
support, or during the aging of such coated silver  
 
halide compositions, has been attempted by a variety of 
means. Mercury-containing compounds, such as those 
described in U.S. Patents 2,728,663; 2,728,664; and 
2,728,665, have been used as additives to control fog. 
Thiosulfonates and thiosulfonate esters, such as those 
described in U.S. Patents 2,440,206; 2,934,198; 
3,047,393; and 4,960,689, have also been employed. 
Organic dichalcogenides, for examples the disulfide 
compounds described in U.S. Patents 1,962,133; 
2,465,149; 2,756,145; 2,935,404; 3,184,313; 3,318,701; 
3,409,437; 3,447,925; 4,243,748; 4,463,082; and 
4,788,132 have been used not only to prevent formation 
of fog but also as desensitizers and as agents in 
processing baths and as additives in diffusion transfer 
systems. Unfortunately, such fog reducing compounds 
are not without drawbacks. Mercury-containing 
compounds at relatively low concentrations can diminish 
the sensitivity of
