<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wide viewing angle 
polarizing plate suitable for the improvement in the viewability 
of transmission type, reflection type or amphibious liquid 
crystal display, etc. The present application is based on Japanese Patent 
Applications No. Hei. 10-126882 and No. Hei. 11-75728, which are 
incorporated herein by reference. As a wide viewing angle polarizing plate intended for the 
expansion of the viewing angle or the compensation for the change 
in phase difference of liquid crystal display there has been 
heretofore known one comprising a laminate of a polarizing plate 
and a light diffusing plate or phase difference plate Japanese 
Patent Publications No. Hei. 9-258013 and 9-325216. However, 
this wide viewing angle polarizing plate is disadvantageous in 
that it is liable to contrast drop or blur of display image or 
leaves something to be desired in the expansion of viewing angle.  It is an object of the present invention to develop a wide 
viewing angle polarizing plate which, when provided in a liquid 
crystal display on the viewing side thereof, acts to compensate 
for the loss of viewing angle by phase difference as well as expand 
the viewing angle by light diffusion and thus causes little or 
no contrast drop or display image blur and a liquid crystal display 
comprising such a wide viewing angle polarizing plate. The present invention provides a wide viewing angle 
polarizing plate comprising a laminate of a polarizing plate and 
a birefringent film having an in-plane average phase difference 
of from 50 nm to 200 nm, characterized in that said birefringent 
film comprises a transparent resin film having microscopic 
regions dispersed therein and satisfies the relationships Δn2 ≤ 
0.03 and Δn1 > Δn2 supposing that the direction of the axis along 
which linearly polarized light exhibits the maximum transmission 
is Δn2 direction, the difference in refractive index between 
microscopic regions in Δn2 direction and other portions is Δn2, 
the direction perpendicular to Δn2 direction is Δn1 direction and 
the difference in refractive index between microscopic regions 
in Δn1 direction and other portions is Δn1, and Δn1 direction and 
the retardation axis of said birefringent film and the 
transmission axis of said polarizing plate are parallel to each 
other.  In accordance with the present invention, the arrangement 
of a birefringent film having a predetermined average phase 
difference such that its retardation axis is parallel to the 
transmission axis of a
