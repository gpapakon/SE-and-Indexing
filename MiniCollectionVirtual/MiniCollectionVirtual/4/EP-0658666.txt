<ABSTRACT>
The fastening system for façade panels (1) comprises a substructure which is formed by profiles, is fastened on a wall and has carrying elements (6), on which there may be fitted panel-carrying profiles (2) which are connected to the rear side of the façade panels. Per façade-panel element (5), the carrying elements (6) comprise a fixed-bearing carrying element (7) and at least three loose7-bearing carrying elements (8). The fixed-bearing carrying element (7) is preferably arranged in an upper corner region of a façade-panel element (5) and fixedly connected to the corresponding panel-carrying profile (2) of the façade-panel element (5). Furthermore, the fixed-bearing carrying element (7) exhibits an adjustment device which permits horizontal and vertical adjustment. The lift-bearing carrying element (8), preferably in the other upper corner region of the façade-panel element (5), is likewise provided with an adjustment device for vertical adjustment. The fastening system according to the invention permits simple mounting and alignment of the façade panels and is a statically determinate system which avoids stresses due to heat expansion within the system.

<CLAIMS>
A fixing system having an adjusting and fixing device 
allowing a horizontal and vertical adjustment for facing panels 

(1) for cladding a wall (22) provided with a substructure, the 
fixing system consisting of a suspension device secured to the 

rear side of the facing panels (1) by means of mounting anchors 
(9), which suspension device is suspendable in supporting elements 

(6) joined to the substructure to form one locating and at least 
three non-locating bearings, characterized in that the suspension 

device is formed by at least two profiled panel supports (2) that 
are arranged vertically parallel and spaced from one another and 

which at their top end (3) and bottom end (4) have recesses (27, 
27') for mounting on the supporting elements (6), and in that each 

facing panel (1) is fixedly connected at one point to a profiled 
panel support (2) with an adjustable offset and freely connected 

at at least one further point. 
A fixing system according to claim 1, characterized in that 
several facing panels (1) arranged one above the other are 

arranged to be combined by means of the profiled panel supports 
(2) to form a facing panel element (5). 
A fixing system according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the supporting elements (6) are in the form of U-shaped members 

which face towards the facing panels (1) with their open side, and 
which have a bolt (23, 26) mounted in the two arms (29) for 

engagement of a profiled panel support (2). 
A fixing system according to claim 3, characterized in that 
at least the locating supporting element (7) and one non-locating 

supporting element (8) have in the bolt (23, 26) a central 
transverse threaded bore (30) for vertical adjustment and the 

locating supporting element (7) has screw elements (28) arranged  
 

on its arms (29) for horizontal adjustment and fixing of the 
profiled panel support (2) to the locating supporting element (7). 
A fixing system according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the free mounting of the fixing points between the profile panel 

support (2) and the facing panel (1) is effected by way of a 
mounting element (13, 18) which is secured in a bore (14) in the 

profiled panel support (2) with freedom of movement in the axial 
and radial direction.
