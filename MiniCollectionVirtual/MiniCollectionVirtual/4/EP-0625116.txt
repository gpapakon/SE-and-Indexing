<ABSTRACT>
A container (4) for a lubricant has a cap (31) for sealing of one end (50) of a cylindrical tube (2). The cap shows a bottom (32), from the periphery of which extends in axial direction a circumferential interior collar (36), which abuts the inside of said tube end and has a double function, namely apart from the sealing frunction a second function as plunger for feeding out the tube contents by means of e.g. a plunger rod of a pistol-like tool as known per se. To this purpose, the delimitation edge of the interior collar (36) which is turned away from the bottom connects to a bridge (39) located within a radial plane and leading to an exterior collar (40) which is concentric with the interior collar and surrounds said tube end together with the interior collar and the bridge. This cap is provided with a groove-like circumferential weakened part (38) permitting release of the bottom (32) during transition to plunger function. According to the invention said weakened part (38) is provided within or at said bridge (39) and are the sides of the collars and the tube which are facing each other provided with circumferential arresting and sealing grooves and bulges, respectively, acting upon the other part for at least temporaly positioning or retaining or sealing of the cap (31) in relation to the tube. Furthermore, the other tube end is sealed by a specially shaped cap which is provided with a spout (46), which latter cap co-operates with a likewise specially designed tube end.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container with at least one 
closure means according to the preamble of claim 1. The invention is particularly concerned with lubricant cartridges 
and caps for sealing same. Today, consciousness towards the environment is greater than in the 
past and containers must fulfill high safety demands, particularly 
for substances which are detrimental to the environment. Nevertheless, such containers should be simple and easy to produce 
at low costs and their handling should also be easy and simple, 
both as to filling, preferably fully automatic sealing as well as 
repeated sealing at great and maintained safety, even after 
repeated opening and closing operations. The closure means should 
even be able to resist outer and interior strain up to a certain 
level, so that leakage may be avoided with comparatively great 
security. Furthermore, the contents of such a container must be fed 
out in a simple and reliable way. The previously known containers and their closure means do not 
fulfill these demands, at least not in combination. Beyond this limited function, previously known caps suffer often 
from the drawback, that they do not seal the container sufficiently 
safely. Leakage may thus occur easily and frequently and often a 
full container and maybe even adjacent containers, the contents of 
which has leaked out, are thrown away, as it can be rather 
unpleasant to get hands, clothes etc polluted. Apart from possible leakage, the previously known caps are nevertheless 
hard to remove, particularly caps which are not designed as  
 
screwcaps. If the caps are designed as screwcaps, i.a. increased 
material thickness is required as well as extra means to provide 
the cap with interior threads and furthermore extra means to 
provide the one cartridge end with outer threads. By US-A-4 605 129, there is previously known a cylindrical 
container, one end of which is closed by a lid showing a 
cylindrical body inside the container body, the outside of the 
cylindrical body facing the container body has two ribbing rings to 
provide a better seal. Adjacent to the cylindrical body there is 
also a U-shaped edge, which is sealed to the outside of the 
container body. At the point where the cylindrical body and the U-shaped 
edge join, there is a notch that goes all the way round the 
lid and that serves as a line of weakening, so that these two parts 
of the lid can be torn apart.  
  
 One objective of the present invention is therefore to provide an 
advantageous container

circular cylindrical annular part (20), which is equally long as or 
somewhat longer in axial direction than the interior annular part 

(17), counted from the annular part (16), that the cap periphery 
(16, 17, 20) confines an annular groove (21) for receiving and

facing each other, but are slightly offset in relation to one 
another in axial direction, that the free axial half (27) of the  

 
annular part (20) preferably is somewhat bent outwardly or provided

the lateral wall of the cap (3), that continuing from the bulge the 

cap is inclined obliquely inwardly to connect to a bowl-like bottom 
(19), that the bulge downwardly forms a longer bevel with a minor 

angle, e.g. 30° - 45°, in relation to the lateral wall (17), while 
the remainder uppermost is more acutely rounded with an angle of 

e.g. 45° - 90° close to the lateral wall, that there is an upper 
cavity (54) within the cap with a preferably triangular gripping 

handle (52), which is designed in one piece with the cap and 
connects to a spot-like area uppermost at the lateral wall (17) via 

a small tongue (53), which connects to the upper inside of the cap, 

and/or that the bottom (19) is provided with a spout (44), 
preferably a pipe which converges conically outwardly and has an 

annular bulge (45) at its free end, which bulge is intended to be

sheared off without preceding tearing off the outer collar, that 
the bottom of the annular groove (38) in its thickness is substantially 

reduced, and/or that the bottom of the annular groove is 
placed directly against the interior edge of the respective tube 

end (30), which edge preferably is relatively sharp, the bridge 
part (39) being placed butt against said tube end, and that a 

plunger rod of a grease gun or the like is intended to push the so 
formed plunger part of the cap longer into the tube with overcoming 

the retaining force created by the bulges and grooves (37, 
43 and 51), the retaining force of the bulge (41) of the outer  

 
collar having possibly ceased before by removal of the outer 

collar, and/or that the outer collar is provided to be left on the 
tube and is preferably provided with a special tear-off-means and 

is secured in its position separated from the interior collar and 
the bottom in that the bridge part even after separation will rest 

against the respective tube end from the one side and the bulge 
(41) of the collar grasps around the tube bulge (43) from the opposite 

direction, that when separating the plunger constituted by the 
bottom and the interior collar with remaining exterior collar the 

interior bulge (37) is retained in the interior groove of the tube 
until a certain pressure has been reached, by means of which a 

plunger rod is pressed onto the cap bottom, and that when exceeding 
this pressure the bulge (37) is intended to be released in a snap-like 

manner from the groove (51), so that the actual pressure level 
acts like a stroke on the bottom of the circumferential groove (38) 

for shearing off the thin bottom against the underlying interior 
edge of this tube end and to form in this way a threshold against 

unintended break up of this closure means and simultaneously 
creating a very limited region for intended break up.
