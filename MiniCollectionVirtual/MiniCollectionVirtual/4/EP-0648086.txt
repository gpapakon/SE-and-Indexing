<ABSTRACT>
A cardiac ablation catheter (10) includes a distal, energy delivering electrode (14) and at least one sensing electrode (16) proximal to the energy delivering electrode (14). The catheter communicates with an electrosurgical generator (22) which provides electrical energy, such as a radio frequency energy, to the distal energy (14). The sensing electrodes (16) communicate with a monitor (24) for recording electrical signals within the heart. One or more resistors (30) is positioned adjacent each sensing electrode (16), and in series with a conductor (20) associated with the sensing electrode (16), to reduce or eliminate any current tending to be emitted through the sensing electrodes (16) as a result of delivery of electrical current through the distal electrode (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
 CARDIAC ABLATION CATHETER HAVING RESTSTTVE MAPPTNG ELECTRODESBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to intravascular catheters, and more particularly to endocardial ablation catheters and to their method of use in treating arrhythmia using radio frequency energy.The heart is a muscular organ comprising four separate chambers which cooperate to pump blood throughout the body. The heart muscles must contract and relax in a coordinated sequence in order for blood to be passed through the circulatory system in an efficient manner. The heart includes a specialized system for generating impulses to cause rhythmical contraction of the heart muscle and for conducting these impulses rapidly through the heart. In the proper sequence the atria contract about one sixth of a second prior to ventricles. This enables extra filling of the ventricles before they contract to pump blood through the lungs and to other areas of the body.The rhythmic impulse of the heart is generated in the sinoatrial node (SA node). The SA node has an inherent rhythm which can be modified by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The impulse initiated by the SA node spreads through the atrium to the atrio-ventricular node (AV node), and then through the Purkinje fibers to the endocardial surfaces of the ventricles.The rhythmical and conduction system of the heart is susceptible to disruption by disease. Such damage can result from the inability of the cardiac conduction pathways to properly transmit the electrical impulses generated in the SA node, leading to arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats. Cardiac arrhythmias can often be detected through electrocardiograms.Some forms of cardiac arrhythmia are able to be controlled through medication. However, other forms of arrhythmia do not respond to medication. Moreover, medication typically does not remedy the problem, and the dosage and the medication type must be changed periodically for continued control of the problem. * 

 One alternative to medication is the surgical removal of a portion of the cardiac pathway which is responsible for the arrhythmia. The many dangers associated with open heart surgery render this a less preferred treatment option. Recently, however, it has become possible to intravascularly insert a specialized catheter within the heart, for positioning adjacent to the conduction tissue responsible for the arrhythmia. The catheter is adapted to deliver energy (e.g., radio frequency energy) to ablate or destroy the tissue from which the arrhythmia
