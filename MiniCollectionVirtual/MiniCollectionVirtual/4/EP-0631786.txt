<ABSTRACT>
A treatment of ischemia and the attendant reperfusion injury 
entails the administration plasmin and plasmin-forming proteins, 

including lys-plasminogen and similar substances. Lys-plasminogen, 
which can be obtained from the proteolytic cleavage 

of glu-plasminogen, has been found to have a protective effect on 
tissue that has been injured by ischemic conditions. The 

administration of lys-plasminogen can used to treat subjects 
during the time of reperfusion and after reperfusion has already 

occurred. Lys-plasminogen also can be administered in 
conjunction with clot lysis therapies, such as those that employ 

tissue plasminogen activator and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
Stroke remains the third most common cause of death in the
industrial world, ranking behind ischemic heart disease and
cancer. Strokes are responsible for about 300,000 deaths
annually in the United States and about 11,000 deaths annually in
Austria. Strokes are also a leading cause of hospital admissions
and long-term disabilities. Accordingly, the socioeconomic
impact of stroke and its attendant burden on society is
practically immeasurable.
"Stroke" is defined by the World Health Organization as a rapidly
developing clinical sign of focal or global disturbance of
cerebral function with symptoms lasting at least 24 hours.
Strokes are also implicated in deaths where there is no apparent
cause other than an effect of vascular origin.Strokes are typically caused by blockages or occlusions of
the blood vessels to the brain or within the brain. With
complete occlusion, arrest of cerebral circulation causes
cessation of neuronal electrical activity within seconds. Within
a few minutes after the deterioration of the energy state and ion
homeostasis, depletion of high energy phosphates, membrane ion
pump failure, efflux of cellular potassium, influx of sodium
chloride and water, and membrane depolarization occur. If the
occlusion persists for more than five to ten minutes,
irreversible damage results. With incomplete ischemia, however,
the outcome is difficult to evaluate and depends largely on
residual perfusion and the availability of oxygen. After a
thrombotic occlusion of a cerebral vessel, ischemia is rarely
total. Some residual perfusion usually persists in the ischemic 
area, depending on collateral blood flow and local perfusion
pressure.Cerebral blood flow can compensate for drops in mean
arterial blood pressure from 90 to 60 mm Hg by autoregulation.
This phenomenon involves dilatation of downstream resistant
vessels. Below the lower level of autoregulation (about 60 mm
Hg), vasodilatation is inadequate and the cerebral blood flow
falls. The brain, however, has perfusion reserves that can
compensate for the fall in cerebral blood fall. This reserve
exists because under normal conditions only about 35% of the
oxygen delivered by the blood is extracted. Therefore, increased
oxygen extraction can take place, provided that normoxia and
normocapnea exist. When distal blood pressure falls below
approximately 30 mm Hg, the two compensatory mechanisms
(autoregulation and perfusion reserve) are inadequate to prevent
failure of oxygen delivery.As flow drops below the ischemic threshold of 23
ml/100g/minute,
