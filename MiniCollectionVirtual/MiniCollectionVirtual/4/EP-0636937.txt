<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to color developing
agent compositions and color developer compositions for processing silver
halide color photographic material and a method of using the
same. More specifically, the invention relates to
aqueous solutions of color developing agent compositions having excellent
stability in use and color developer compositions used in highly
concentrated solution for color development processing wherein
the compositions are capable of preventing precipitation of the
color developer agent.Among the basic processes of color photographic material that
are effected after exposure of the photographic material to a
light image, are those of color developing, silver bleaching,
silver halide fixing, bleaching fixing, in which a bleaching 
process and a fixing process are effected at a time, water
washing, rinsing which is effected in lieu of the water washing
process, stabilizing and drying. In addition, there are
additional processes, which are executed to permit each process
to be used stably or to increase the physical strength and
stability of the processed photographic material. Among methods
of processing silver halide color photographic materials are
those of processing color negative films to obtain color prints,
which are the methods most widely used today, and those for
directly obtaining final images in the form of positive color
films or prints. Further, users of color prints want to see the
prints as soon as possible and desire the production of prints in
a period of time as short as possible. To meet this demand, it
is necessary to provide quick processing.In recent years, it is possible to quickly process silver
halide color photographic materials owing to improvements
therein. In addition, easy processing of a large quantity of
materials is possible with automatic developing apparatus.
Further, the automatic developing apparatus has been improved, 
and a variety of compact and inexpensive apparatuses are used.
An automatic developing apparatus is normally used for carrying
out the above photographic process. In actual processing of a
large quantity of photographic materials, the process of a given
quantity of photographic material is carried out while
replenishing with a necessary quantity of process solution as
replenishment solution. A photographic material processor who
accepts a request to process photographic material from a
photographer has to effect the desired process in a short period
of time.In order to process a silver halide color photographic
material easily
