<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of transforming an input image, which is generated by an X-ray photograph, includes attenuated structures and consists of pixels which are defined by their co-ordinates and their respective input image value, into an essentially distortion-free output image, which consists of pixels which are defined by their co-ordinates and their respective output image value. The assigned co-ordinates in the output image are determined from the co-ordinates of a pixel in the input image, and an output image value is derived from the input image value of the relevant pixel. The time for the transformation can be considerably reduced by a threshold operation to determine those pixels (u, v) of the input image in which the attenuated structures are represented, and by carrying out the transformation only for these pixels.
