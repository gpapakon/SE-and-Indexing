<ABSTRACT>
A multi-pass evaporator (10) of a heat 
exchanger for a motor vehicle air-conditioning system 

includes a plurality of heat exchanger tubes (12a-t) 
coupled to first and second header tubes (30,32) 

disposed side by side. The first header tube contains 
an inlet tube (48) extending from an inlet end (38) of 

the first header tube (30) to a position intermediate 
the length of the first header tube (30). The ratio 

of the axial cross-sectional area of the interior of 
the inlet tube (48) to the axial cross-sectional area 

of the space between the first header tube (30) and 
the inlet tube (48) is in the range of 1:4.0 to 1:7.0. 

The axial cross-sectional area of the interior of the 
inlet tube (48) is equal to or greater than 35 mmÂ². 

This ratio of areas and size of inlet tube has been 
found to reduce considerably noise produced during use 

of the evaporator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
multi-pass evaporator for use, for
example, in a motor vehicle air-conditioning system.An example of a refrigerant evaporator of the
U-flow type of tube and fin construction is shown in
EP-A-0138435. US-A-4274482 discloses a multi-pass evaporator
in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1.Typically, such refrigerant evaporators
utilise a number of U-shaped tubes which are
interconnected at the ends thereof by two adjacent
header tubes so as to form a bank of interconnected
U-shaped tubes in which refrigerant fluid supplied to
one of the header tubes can pass in parallel flow
through the U-shaped tubes into the other header tube.
Such a bank of U-shaped tubes is substantially
rectangular in shape and typically has been housed in
a substantially rectangular box-like housing within
the motor vehicle air-conditioning system. These
U-flow refrigerant evaporators display good
refrigerant fluid pressure drop characteristics when
in operation.It is customary in such refrigerant
evaporators to sub-divide the two adjacent header
tubes into separate multi-pass manifolds which
interconnect the ends of the U-shaped tubes so that
the refrigerant fluid is caused to flow in several
passes, each containing several U-shaped tubes,
backwards and forwards across the evaporator from one
header tube to the other header tube. In such
refrigerant evaporators, it is customary to have an
inlet for the refrigerant fluid entering one end of
one of the header tubes and an outlet for the
refrigerant fluid exiting from the other end of that
header tube or the adjacent end of the adjacent header
tube, depending on how many passes are provided in the
evaporator. Thus, in the customary three-pass U-flow 
refrigerant evaporator, the inlet for the refrigerant
fluid is one end of one of the header tubes and the
outlet is at the other end of the other header tube.Problems are now arising in the design of
modern motor vehicles wherein the quantity of
auxiliary equipment being provided in the motor
vehicle is conflicting with the space available in the
motor vehicle to house such equipment. Consequently,
the volume of space available to house air
conditioning systems in many modern motor vehicles is
so confined that, in many instances, there is
insufficient room for a rectangular-shaped refrigerant
evaporator of the type which has a refrigerant fluid
inlet positioned at one end of the evaporator and a
refrigerant fluid outlet positioned at the other end
of the evaporator.An arrangement has been devised for
