<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spatial
optical transmission apparatus for transmitting a light
beam in space, and in particular to a spatial optical
transmission apparatus and a spatial optical transmission
method for performing a spatial optical transmission
by utilizing the coherency of a laser beam.Conventionally, by means of optical heterodyne
wavedetection, a spatial optical transmitting
method utilizing the coherency of a laser beam (hereinafter,
referred to as an optical heterodyne detection
transmission method) has provided a transmission at a
high S/N ratio (signal to noise ratio) compared with
that provided by a spatial optical transmitting method
based on light intensity modulation and direct wavedetection
(hereinafter, referred to as an optical direct
detection transmission method). In addition, the
optical heterodyne transmission detection method is
characteristically less affected by incoherent light
(background light) existing in the natural world.
Thus, when using this method, a transmission at a
transmission speed of e.g., 10 Mbps (10 megabits per
second) can be performed with a minimum receiving light
power equal to or less than about one-eighth of that in
the case of the optical direct detection transmission
method. This assures long-distance and high-speed
transmissions at approximately 10 Mbps, which is a
transmission speed required for transmission of a
digital moving image or the like but difficult to 
realize by the optical direct detection transmission
method.Referring to Figure 22, a line P0d shows the
relationship between the transmission speed and the
transmission distance which are obtainable at a given
receiving light power by an optical direct detection
transmission method. A line P0c shows the relationship
between the transmission speed and the transmission
distance which are obtainable at a given receiving
light power (equal to the given receiving light power
in the optical direct detection transmission method)
by a coherent detection method. As is seen from Figure
22, at a transmission speed of 10 Mbps, the transmission
distance can be extended to a point where the
receiving light power is about one-eighth as large
as that obtained in the optical direct detection transmission
method.In the above-mentioned manner, when a receiving
light power is constant, the relationship between
the transmission distance and the transmission speed is
defined by the product of the transmission distance and
the transmission speed. As the receiving light power
becomes larger, the
