<DESCRIPTION>
Plants, as well as humans and animals, suffer injury and losses due to infection by bacteria. On a worldwide basis, bacteria classified in the genera Erwinia, Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas are responsible for most losses due to bacterial plant pathogens. Many of the bacterial diseases of plants cause farmers great losses on a sporadic basis. The losses result from death, disfigurement or reduced productivity of affected plants.Many bacterial pathogens of plants exhibit a marked degree of specificity towards the plants that they infect. For example, Erwinia amylovora infects apples, pears and related plants of the family Rosaceae. Other plants do not become diseased when exposed to E. amylovora. However, when sufficient cells of E. amylovora are introduced into leaf tissue of the other plants, the mesoptiyll tissue collapses within hours. This collapse has been called the hypersensitive response (HR), and it is considered a defense reaction of plants since, during the HR. the bacteria are delimited within the collapsed tissue, eventually die, and thus do not cause much damage to the plant as a whole.The genes that bacterial plant pathogens require for HR-eliciting ability, are called hrp genes, for hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity, are also required for causing disease. However, the products of hrp genes and how they function in elicitation of the HR, and in disease development, remained unknown prior to the present invention. The present invention concerns products of hrp genes (elicitors) that are responsible for the collapse seen in the HR and are required for disease development.Interactions between bacterial pathogens and their plant hosts generally fall into two categories: (1) compatible (pathogen-host). leading to intercellular bacterial growth, symptom development and disease development in the host plant; and (2) incompatible (pathogen-nonhost), resulting in the hypersensitive response, a particular type of incompatible interaction occurring, without progressive disease symptoms. During compatible interactions on host plants, bacterial populations increase dramatically and progressive symptoms occur; during incompatible interactions bacterial populations do not increase, and progressive symptoms do not occur.The hypersensitive response of higher plants is characterized by the rapid, localized collapse and death of tissues containing an incompatible pathogen (a microorganism that is pathogenic only on other plants) and is associated with the defense of plants against many bacteria, fungi,
