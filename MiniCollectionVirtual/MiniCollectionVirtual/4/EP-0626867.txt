 OVERWORN LENS SIGNALING METHODOLOGYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention. This invention relates to contact lenses including those contact lenses having a predeterminable normal lifetime. In particular, the present invention relates to methods useful to quickly and effectively identify lenses whose wear-life approaches the recommended lifetime of the lens.2. Related Art. Currently, a major problem with disposable lenses is that patients do not dispose of the lenses pursuant to the manufacturer's instructions, that is, by the time the manufacturer believes that the lens has reached its lifetime and has become overworn and should be discarded. Patients often do not dispose of the lenses when the manufacturer indicates they have run their lifetime since many patients perceive lenses to be functional and safe past the recommended wear schedule. This can cause problems with regards to lens performance and the health of the patient due to the fact that an overworn disposable lens is very susceptible to deposit formation, and prolonged extended wear places the patient at a higher risk for ocular complications.Contact lenses are often periodically disinfected to protect the wearer's eyes from infection and to improve the wearer's comfort. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,997,626 to Dziabo and assigned to Allergan, Inc. discloses a method for disinfecting a contact lens comprising contacting the contact lens to be disinfected in a liquid medium with chlorine dioxide present in an amount effective to disinfect the contact lens to be disinfected. 

 It is well known to apply tints to contact lenses for a variety of reasons. Opaque tints are used to change eye color. Cosmetic tints, also known as "enhancement" tints, are used to enhance the eye color. CIBA Geigy sells a number of cosmetically tinted lenses including those having blue, green and brown tints. Bausch and Lo b manufactures lenses having blue cosmetic tints, among other colors.Both cosmetic tints and opaque tints are typically applied to the portion of the lens that would cover the iris of the eye.Another type of tint is a "handling" tint. A handling tint is typically applied to the entire contact lens surface, but at much reduced concentration when compared to an enhancement tint. A handling tint is not intended to enhance or change eye color. Rather, a handling tint is intended to assist the lens user in locating lenses misplaced due to the transparency of the lens material. Due to the slight intensity of color, when the handling tinted

What is claimed is:
1. A method for facilitating the determination as to when a contact lens is approaching or has passed the estimated lifetime of the lens, the method comprising: adding an effective amount of a tint to the lens to thereby form a tinted lens, the effective amount being such that after periodically contacting the lens with a predetermined solution for a time period approaching the estimated lifetime of the lens, a change in the appearance of the tinted lens is detected; detecting the color of the tinted lens; contacting the tinted lens with the predetermined solution; and detecting after contact with the solution the color of the tinted lens.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the solution is an oxidant disinfection solution.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the solution is a chlorine dioxide solution. 


4. The method of claim 1 wherein the solution is a disinfection solution and further including the step of comparing the color of the tinted lens before and after contact with the disinfection solution.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the lenses are compared against a piece of material having.a white surface.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the lens is disposable.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the tint is selected from the group consisting of Blue #19, Blue #6 and Blue #4.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the solution is a chlorine dioxide solution.
9. The method of claim 3 wherein there is present above 0.2 ppm chlorine dioxide.
10. The method of claim 3 wherein there is present from 0.2 to 5 ppm chlorine dioxide.
11. The method of claim 3 wherein there is present from 0.2 to 2.5 ppm chlorine dioxide. 


12. The method according to claim 4 wherein after comparison with the lens color before any particular disinfection step and the lens color immediately after the subsequent such disinfection step, there is over a fifty percent change in tint intensity by transmittance.
13. The method of claim 2 wherein there is an observable change in tint color when comparing said lens before and after said disinfection.
14. The method' of claim 1 wherein the lens is Hydron Zero 4.
15. The method of claim 1 wherein the lens is Hydron Zero 6. 

16. The method of claim 2 wherein the amount of tint in the lens is determined by: determining the concentration of chlorine dioxide to be used to disinfect the lens; determining the estimated lens lifetime; determining the normal disinfection regimen for the lenses and how long the lenses will be disinfected over the estimated lifetime of the lens; and calculating the amount of tint such that after the normal disinfection regimen for the lens to just before the estimated lifetime of the lens, the lens tint will noticeably change in color intensity.
17. A method for safeguarding a contact lens user's eyes, the method comprising the steps of: applying to the lens a detectable agent which can be detected to thereby form an applied lens; and contacting the resulting applied lens with a changing agent which will change the detectable appearance of the applied lens by affecting the detectable agent.
18. A method according to claim 17 wherein the detectable agent is a handling tint. 


19. A method according to claim 17 wherein the changing agent is a solution containing a lens disinfecting agent.
20. A method according to Claim 17 wherein the changing agent is chlorine dioxide.
