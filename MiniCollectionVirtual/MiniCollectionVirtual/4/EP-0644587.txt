<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thin-type
semiconductor package fabrication method for use with for
example a card-type external storage medium.As storage apparatuses for recording and storing data,
for example memory cards are known. These memory cards have
restrictions in their size (length, width, and thickness) and
the like. Thus, semiconductor chips (IC chips) that are used
with the memory cards should be compact. In addition, the
memory cards in which the semiconductor chips are mounted
should be thin.To mount semiconductor chips in a limited space with a
thickness of 1 mm or less, TAB (Tape Automated Bonding) method
and flip chip method, COB (Chip On Board) method are known.
As an example of the thin-type packages, a module shown in
Fig. 1 is known. The module shown in Fig. 1 comprises a
circuit board 2, an external connecting terminal 4, and a mold
resin layer 5. A semiconductor chip 1 is mounted on a first 
main surface of the circuit board 2. The external connecting
terminal 4 is connected to a second main surface of the
circuit board 2 through a through-hole 3. The mold resin
layer 5 seals and coats the mounting region of the
semiconductor chip 1. In Fig. 1, reference numeral 6 is a
bonding wire.However, the above-mentioned TAB method is not a
practical means from a cost point of view because of: (a)
The fabrication cost of a carrier tape is relatively high.
(b) Since dedicated metal mold and bonding tool corresponding
to the package size are required in the mounting process, the
assembling cost is relatively high.On the other hand, in the above-mentioned flip chip
mounting method and COB method, it is difficult to provide KGN
(Known Good Die). Normally, the semiconductor chip 1 for use
should have been burnt in. However, the burn-in technologies
for chips have not been accomplished. Thus, since the
semiconductor chip 1 that has not been burnt in should be
used, there is a problem on the reliability. In other words,
with this semiconductor chip (IC chip) 1, a defect that will
take place in the near future cannot be predicted. In other
words, the semiconductor chip 1 cannot be burnt in. Thus, in
initial practical phases where the semiconductor chip 1 is
mounted and thereby a module is formed, a trouble may take
place. GB A 2 081 974 discloses a carrier element for an IC module for incorporation into
identification cards. The carrier element comprises a through hole plated film having
contact surfaces arranged on both sides of the film.EP A 0 321 239 discloses a method for fabricating a
