<ABSTRACT>
A wireless communication system (10) includes a plurality of 
stations (12) each having a plurality of antennas (14,16). A first packet 

(120), containing a training signal portion (122) is transmitted from a 
transmitting station using a first selected antenna and received at a 

receiving station using a second selected antenna which is selected as 
the antenna giving the best received signal quality, determined during 

the training signal period. Following transmission of the first packet, a 
control signal (ACKCNTL) is generated in both the transmitting station 

and the receiving station to condition these stations for the transmission 
from the receiving station of a response packet (136) via the same 

antenna pair used for the information packet transmission. Thus, the 
response packet (136) need have only a relatively short training signal 

portion (138).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wireless communication system and to
a method of operating such a system.An important effect in wireless communication and especially
indoor radio data communication is fading. This is the phenomenon
which occurs when multiple copies of an omnidirected transmitted
signal arrive at a receiver antenna via different paths, having different
propagation delays. The signals will add together, but with different
relative phases with respect to each other, which may result in an
increased signal level, but may also result in a much lower level signal
when multiple received signals cancel each other out, depending on the
relative phases of the signals.To deal with this phenomenon, wireless communication systems
need to be designed with significant margins in the receiver dynamic
range, such that the added attenuation as a result of a fade can be
overcome. The probability of a signal level at a given distance between
the transmitter and the receiver is given by a so-called Rayleigh
attenuation model. Maintaining a given margin for this effect results in
a so-called outage probability, which is the probability that a fade is so
deep that the signal cannot be received. The outage probability can be
significantly reduced if more than one antenna is used for reception of
the signal, as long as the received signal levels on the antennas are
independent or uncorrelated.Different methodologies can be used to combine the signals
received over the antennas. One of the methods which can be
implemented with only a single radio receiver is the so-called selection
diversity system, which selects the best antenna based on the measured
signal quality. The resulting outage probability of such a system is the
product of the individual probabilities, and is therefore considerably
reduced.Such a selection diversity system is described, for example, in US
Patent No. 5,131,006, which discloses a wireless local area network
including a plurality of stations adapted to communicate with one
another over a common wireless communication channel. Each station 
has two antennas, which are polarized in different directions, such as at
right angles to each other. Packets transmitted in the network include
an initial training signal portion which extends over a plurality of
antenna selection periods, referred to as antenna slot periods. During
the receipt of a training signal at a station, the station alternates between
its antennas for a plurality (e.g. four) of successive antenna slot periods,
the received signal
