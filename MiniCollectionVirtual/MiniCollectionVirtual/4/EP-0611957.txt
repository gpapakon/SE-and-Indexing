<ABSTRACT>
Weighing device, particularly for mounting on a vehicle or a 
part thereof, such as to a weighing platform, said device 

comprising a bearing frame (1) connectable to the vehicle, 
and a weighing frame (2) provided with means for carrying a 

load and being suspended to the bearing frame through suspension 
elements (6) being movably connected to said frames. 

A load cell (3) is mounted in a suspension element (6) or 
between that and the junction to one of the frames (1, 2) 

and a summation device is present for summing the forces 
exerted on the load cells (3) during weighing. The suspension 

elements (6) are received in a recess (16) near the edge 
of the bearing frame (1) or the weighing frame (2), each 

individually or together, and having substantially complete 
freedom of movement within said recess. One end (7, 8) of a 

suspension element (6) is connected to a fastening member 
(5) connected to one of the frames (1, 2) and the other end 

(7) to a console (4) which extends substantially in horizontal 
sense to beyond the recess (16) and is connected to 

the other one of both said frames (2, 1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a weighing device, particularly
for mounting on a vehicle as this is described in the preamble
of the main claim.Such a device is known from EP-A-O 476 778. In case of
this know device dirt and moisture from the loading surface of
the weighing frame can end up in the spaces in which the suspension
elements and the load cells are situated. Also mechanical
damage of said parts can occur when objects end up in
the spaces and on the suspension elements concerned. Especially
when the loading surface of the weighing device and e.g.
the loading flap in which it is mounted, are to be cleaned
regularly, this can cause difficulties.The object of the invention is to remove these difficulties
and to that end the features are applied as indicated in
the characterizing portion of claim 1.So the housing in which a suspension element is present
is fixedly connected to either the bearing frame or the weighing
frame and is substantially completely closed with exception
of the opening through wich a console extends which is
connected to either the weighing frame or the bearing frame.By applying the feature of claim 2 it is obtained that
the upper surface of the weighing frame as a whole is available
for the load to be weighed, there being no consoles or
other parts extending above said surface.By applying the feature of claim 3 it is obtained that
the opening, which has to be present between the bearing and
the weighing frame to allow movement of the weighing frame, is
covered by the upper surface of the weighing frame.By providing the outer edge of the weighing frame with a
flexible sheet, such as from a plastic, or with a brush a
sealing can be established of the opening between the bearing
frame and the weighing frame. Due to this water falling on the weighing frame can be
discharged to beyond the weighing device. By a proper choice
of the flexible material, this will not affect the result of
the weighing, or only affect this within the acceptable tolerances.By applying the feature according to claim 5 a simple
sealing can be obtained between a console and the opening in
which it must be slightly movable. According to one embodiment, the bearing frame can
enclose the weighing frame at least partially, with a supplementary
opening for a connecting piece being present in
the bearing frame, said connecting piece being mounted on
the enclosed part of the weighing frame on the one hand and
on the part of the weighing frame serving to carry the load
on the other hand.In a special embodiment, the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A weighing device for mounting on a vehicle or a part
connected thereto comprising a bearing frame (1) connectable to

the vehicle or to said part thereof, and a weighing frame (2)
for carrying a load and suspended to the bearing frame through

suspension elements (6) which are both flexible and movably

connected to respective connection members (4,5) extending laterally
and being connected to said weighing and bearing frames respectively (1, 2) to allow

the weighing frame (2) to move freely in relation to the
bearing frame (1) within certain limits, a load cell (3) being

mounted in a suspension element (6), and a summation device
summing the forces exerted on the individual load cells (3),

said suspension elements (6) each being arranged near the
bearing and weighing frame edges, each

of said suspension elements (6) is positioned
enclosing said suspension element, within a housing (17) 
characterized in that
 said housing is fixedly connected to one
of said frames (1,2), said suspension element

(6) being flexibly connected to a connection member (4,5) which is fixedly
connected to said housing (17) such that said supension element

is having substantially its complete freedom of movement with in said housing,
the connection member (5,4) connecting said suspension element to the other frame (2,1) extending

through an opening (18) in said housing.
Weighing device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said housing (17) is situated completely below the upper
surface of the weighing frame (2).
Weighing device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 the edges of the upper surface of the weighing frame
(2) are situated at a higher level than the upper surface of

the bearing frame (1), said upper surface of the weighing
frame extending laterally above part of said bearing frame (1).
Weighing device according to claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 the outer edge of the weighing frame (2) is provided with
