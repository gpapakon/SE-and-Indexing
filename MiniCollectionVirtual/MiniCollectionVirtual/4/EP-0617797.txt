<ABSTRACT>
A system (4) for generating an image of an object, comprising a combination of a sensing feature (2) for measuring the spatial component parameters (amplitude, phase, etc.) of the object basis functions that satisfy a Bragg condition, together with an image synthesis feature (16, 18) for generating a reconstructed image of the object using the measured parameters of the basis functions. The image reconstruction feature may optically project spatial components (6) (spatial frequencies). The image reconstruction feature may optically record the spatial frequency domain sequentially, then perform a two dimensional Fourier transform by a variety of methods. The image reconstruction feature is not restricted to optical radiation, and may include projection imaging systems that use other forms of wavelike radiation. The image reconstruction feature does not require purely digital electronic methods for producing a two-dimensional image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for generating
images from the results of linear sensing processes. The
present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S.
application serial number 07/604,255, filed October 29, 1990.Image synthesis systems generate images from the results
of linear sensing processes. The most common forms of image
synthesis systems are optical lens-based systems, such as eyes,
cameras, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes, etc. Other forms
of image synthesis include imaging radars, electron beam
microscopes, medical x-rays, x-ray computerized tomography,
magnetic resonance imaging and sonar systems.Known digital image synthesis systems suffer from a number
of inherent disadvantages. For example, some known image
synthesis systems reconstruct images by using digital
technology to sequentially address every pixel of an image.
This requirement of sequentially addressing each pixel imposes
a limit on the speed with which images may be reconstructed.In addition, in most known digital image synthesis systems
the reconstruction of an image requires the performance of at
least two steps. First, the polar or spherical coordinates of
a spatial frequency must be linearly transformed into
rectangular coordinates. Second, the complex amplitudes of the
spatial frequency components must be interpolated between
neighboring data elements. This interpolation step may be
extremely time consuming and may introduce errors into the
resulting image.Moreover, common optical imaging systems based on physical
lenses are capable of providing numerical apertures of
approximately 0.5. Rarely do such known systems provide
numerical apertures approaching 1.0, and then only when the
object and the lens are immersed in a fluid having an index 
greater than air. In addition, common optical imaging systems
based on physical lenses form images that are limited in
quality by the aberrations of those real lenses. An optical imaging system of that kind is e.g. known
from U.S. 4,305,666.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
imaging system that is not limited by the characteristics of
physical lenses, and that is capable of achieving higher
numerical apertures and better spatial resolution capabilities
than conventional optical systems based on physical lenses.It is a further object of the present invention to provide
an imaging system that avoids lens aberrations inherent in
prior art imaging systems that use real lenses.It is another object of the present invention to provide
for the simultaneous
