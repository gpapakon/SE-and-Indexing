<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for effecting the 
removal of cured polyurethane paint from the surface 

of aromatic polycarbonate blend surfaces. Effective 
removal of thermally cured polyurethane paint from 

aromatic polycarbonate blend surface can be achieved 
by immersing the painted aromatic polycarbonate blend 

in an aqueous bath containing organic solvent, an 
alkali metal hydroxide and a surfactant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
for salvaging aromatic polymeric values, such as
polycarbonate blend values from painted aromatic
polycarbonate blend surfaces. More particularly, the
present invention relates to the use of an aqueous
bath containing an organic solvent, an alkali metal
hydroxide, or alkaline earth metal hydroxide and an
effective amount of a surfactant to effect the removal
of thermally cured polyurethane paint from the surface
of a molded blend of aromatic polycarbonate and
aromatic polyester.There is shown by Bussink et al, U.S.
patent 4,267,096, molded blends of aromatic
polycarbonate, amorphous aromatic polyester and a
hydrogenated block copolymer of a vinyl aromatic
compound and a diolefin. These molded blends exhibit
high impact strength and resistance to melt flow,
environmental stress crazing and crack resistance.
The use of molded blends of aromatic polycarbonate and
aromatic polyester in high impact applications, such
as automobile bumpers, are shown by Van Abeelen et al,
U.S. patent 4,568,712 and Lohmeijer et al, U.S. patent
4,654,400. After molding, the plastic bumper is often
painted with a thermally curable polyurethane paint.In most instances, used painted bumpers are
discarded. These rejected articles cannot be readily
recycled because it has been found difficult to remove
the thermally cured polyurethane paint. Attempts to
extrude such paint containing thermoplastic material 
which has been granulated, can result in the
decomposition of the polyurethane paint to form
hexamethylene diisocyanate, a toxic compound.
Extrusion in the presence of the polyurethane paint
also can adversely affect the performance of any
resulting remolded part, since paint residues can
concentrate stress and diminish physical properties.Mechanical methods for the direct removal
of paint from thermoplastic surfaces, such as by
sandblasting, or with pressurized CO2 have been shown
to be environmentally and economically unattractive.
In US-A-5440,839,
a method is described for removing silicone
hardcoats from polycarbonate substrates utilizing a
50% aqueous caustic solution in combination with
isopropanol. Efforts to use this procedure for
painted thermoplastic bumpers have been found to
result in only the partial removal of thermally cured
polyurethane paint from the surface of painted
aromatic polycarbonate parts.The present invention is based on the
discovery that total removal of thermally cured
polyurethane paint from the surface of molded blends
of aromatic polycarbonate and aromatic

<CLAIMS>
A method for salvaging aromatic
polycarbonate blend values from an aromatic

polycarbonate blend substrate which has been treated
with a thermally cured polyurethane paint, which

method comprises,

(1) contacting the painted aromatic
polycarbonate blend substrate in a paint removal bath

at a temperature of 20°C to 100°C and at a pH of 10 to
14 for a period of time which is at least sufficient

to effect the substantial deprotonation of available
phenolic and alcohol groups in the mixture,
(2) removing the treated aromatic
polycarbonate blend substrate from the mixture of (1),

and
(3) rinsing the treated aromatic
polycarbonate blend substrate with an aqueous solution

having a pH of less than 7 until the pH of the
resulting run-off rinse water has stabilized in the

range of 4 to 7,

where the paint removal bath comprises by weight, 50
to 95% water, 5 to 30% of an organic solvent, an

effective amount of a surfactant, and at least 2% by
weight, based on the weight of the paint removal bath,

of an hydroxide selected from the group consisting of
alkali metals, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and

alkaline earth metals.
A method in accordance with claim 1,
where the aromatic polycarbonate blend is a blend of

an aromatic polycarbonate and aromatic polyester.
A method in accordance with claim 2,
where the aromatic polycarbonate is a bisphenol A

polycarbonate. 
A method in accordance with claim 1,
where the aromatic polycarbonate blend is a blend of

bisphenol A polycarbonate and a polybutylene
terephthalate.
A method in accordance with claim 1,
where the surfactant is an anionic mono or di C
(10)
alkylated
diphenyl diether disulfonate.
A method in accordance with claim 1,
where the alkali metal hydroxide is sodium hydroxide.
