<ABSTRACT>
An unloading device (3) for the metered delivery of powdery or granular material comprises a delivery chute (5) attachable via a connecting funnel (4) to a lower outflow orifice (2) of a material container (1) and leading obliquely downwards. In order to achieve an accurately meterable delivery at little outlay, the delivery chute (5) is provided with a vibrator (7), the connecting funnel (4) has a vibrationally elastic connecting sleeve (6) on the attachment side, and seated in the delivery chute (5) is a metering slide (10) which can be actuated via an actuating drive (11) and which is displaceable out of an open position for coarse metering into an intermediate position for fine metering before a closing position is reached.
