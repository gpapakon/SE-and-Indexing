<ABSTRACT>
A multipurpose chuck apparatus (100) has a chamber (112) for holding 
a medium (114). The medium (114) is heated into a high temperature molten 

state by a radio frequency induction heating coil (130). The medium (114) 
heats up a semiconductor material (118) through a chuck member (116) that 

separates the medium (114) from the semiconductor material (118). The 
heating performed by the radio frequency induction heating coil (130) 

generates a fluid flow within the medium (114), providing a uniform 
temperature distribution throughout the medium (114). A magnetic rotation 

device (144, 146) controls movement of rotating member (121) having a mixing 
member (122) and rotating fins (184, 186) to ensure complete uniform 

temperature distribution throughout the medium (114), especially in the 
vicinity of the chuck member (116). An inlet cooling tube (122) and an outlet 

cooling tube (124), isolated from the medium (114) provide cooling fluid to the 
chuck member (116) for temperature control of the semiconductor material 

(118).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to microelectronics device fabrication
processes and more particularly to a method and apparatus for uniform
semiconductor material processing in a semiconductor device fabrication
equipment.In a variety of semiconductor device fabrication processes, a
semiconductor wafer is heated or cooled and the desired fabrication process
occurs on the temperature controlled semiconductor substrate. To establish
good manufacturing process control, the semiconductor substrate should have
a uniform temperature distribution across its entire surface to avoid
fabrication process nonuniformities and manufacturing yield loss.Conventional semiconductor processing reactors, however, are unable
to effectively provide a uniform temperature distribution across the entire
semiconductor wafer surface, especially at higher processing temperatures.
Further, conventional fabrication reactors do not have the flexibility to
operate over a wide range from low temperature processing to high
temperature processing while still maintaining a uniform temperature
distribution across the semiconductor wafer. Higher processing
temperatures (e.g., 300째C to 1000째C) are required for a variety of device
fabrication process steps in silicon technologies. These include chemical-vapor
deposition (CVD) processes and plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD)
processes for deposition of various material layers. Other thermally
activated high temperature device fabrication processes include thermal 
anneals for implant activation and dopant redistribution as well as thermal
oxidations. On the other hand most plasma etch processes usually require
lower substrate temperatures (e.g., -150째C to 150째C). From US-A-5 025 133 a semiconductor wafer heating device is
known which includes a hollow heating stage. A semiconductor
wafer is disposed over one surface of the heating stage and
a heater is provided over the other surface thereof. A fluid
having an excellent heat conductivity is filled in the
hollow space of the heating stage. The electrically
conductive fluid is stirred uniformly by a rotary magnetic
field generating device, e.g., a rotating magnetic ring or a
coil of an inductive motor disposed around the heating
stage.From EP-A-0 267 451 a reaction system and process for
heating semiconductor substrates is known. The substrate is
held in direct contact with the heating source positioned
within the reactor. The heat source is a thermal delivery
module made of material such as solid silicon carbide, or
high temperature material
