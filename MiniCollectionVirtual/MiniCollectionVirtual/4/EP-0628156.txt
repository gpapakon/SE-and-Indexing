<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for measuring multiphase fluid flows comprising first and second sections each comprising a flow passage having means for making a dynamic pressure measurement on the multiphase fluid flow therethrough, the geometry of the first and second sections differing so as to affect a relationship between void fraction and velocity for the phases in a known manner. The difference in geometry between the two sections can be in the area of the flow passages or in the direction of flow relation to gravity. A method of measuring multiphase flows comprising the steps of: a) directing the flow through a first flow passage including means for making a dynamic pressure measurement; b) measuring a pressure drop across said means; c) directing the flow through a second flow passage including means for making a dynamic pressure measurement; d) measuring a pressure drop across said means; and e) calculating the composition and flow rates of the phases from the measured pressure drops. The method optionally includes the further steps of directing the flow through a pair of passages and f) intermittently isolating one or other of said pair of passages to prevent flow therethrough; g) measuring at least one property of the fluid as the phases separate in the isolated passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLOW MEASUREMENT SYSTEMThe present invention relates to a system for measuring flows of fluids which comprise more than one discrete phase. In particular, the invention relates to a system for measuring two or three phase flows from hydrocarbon wells.The problems associated with measuring the flow rate of a multiphase fluid are well known. Techniques which are applicable to single phase flows such as impeller systems and the like have been shown to be highly inaccurate in multiphase flows and often more than one measurement must be made to enable an accurate measurement of the volumetric flow rates of the various phases. In the oil and gas industry the measurement of multiphase flow is routinely encountered and in the case of producing wells it is common for the produced fluid to comprise a mixture of oil, water and often gas as well. Since it is important to determine the volumetric flow rates of the individual phases at times throughout the life of the well to determine if any remedial action is required to improve or restore the productivity of the well and to assess exactly how much oil is being produced, various methods of flow measurement have been proposed. Typically, the fluids are fed to separators and the volumes of each phase determined separately. However, this requires a large installation and is not able to give an instantaneous deteÏ€nination of the current production from a well. A typical surface system fluid from the well head passes through a choke manifold which can either be a separate system or part of a heater-steam exchange. The fluid is then divided into individual phases with a three phase separation and the flow rates measured at separation temperature and pressure. Samples of the fluids at these conditions are taken, the oil sample being used to determine the oil "shrinkage factor". The oil phase is passed to a gauge tank at atmospheric pressure which permits calibration of the flow meters and atmospheric oil samples to be taken.Systems for measuring multiphase flow are described in US 4856344 and US 4974542 which are incorporated herein by reference. The system described in these two patents comprises a gradio-venturi flow meter arrangement which, by means of differential pressure measurements along its length, provides information concerning the flow rates of the phases. A homogeniser comprising a step discontinuity in the pipe diameter is provided upstream of the measurement section in order to ensure that the separate phases are well mixed in the measurement section.In GB
