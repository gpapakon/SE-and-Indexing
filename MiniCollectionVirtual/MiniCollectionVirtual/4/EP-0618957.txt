<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed refrigeration working fluid compositions comprising tetrafluoroethane refrigerants and certain polyol esters of C7-C10 branched alkanoic acids or mixtures of such branched acids with linear C7-C10 monoalkanoic acids. The polyols are mono-, di- or technical grade pentaerythritol or trimethylolpropane; the esters exhibit suitable viscosity ranges and miscibility with refrigerants over a broad compositional range. The acids have a defined average effective carbon chain length and a certain degree of methyl branching for polyols other than trimethylolpropane.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REFRIGERATION WORKING FLUID COMPOSITIONSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe invention relates to refrigeration working fluid compositions. More particularly this invention relates to refrigeration working fluid compositions comprising mixtures of fluorocarbon refrigerant and certain polyol ester lubricants having suitable viscosities and which are miscible with the refrigerant at low temperatures.Description of Related ArtCooling systems of the mechanical vapor recompression type, including refrigerators, freezers, heat pumps, air conditioning systems, and the like, are well known. In such devices, a refrigerant of suitable boiling point evaporates at low pressure, taking heat from the surrounding zone. The resulting vapor is then compressed and passed to a condenser where it condenses and gives off heat to a second zone. The condensate is then returned through an expansion valve to the evaporator, so completing the cycle.It is recognized that currently used refrigerants which contain chlorine, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, will be replaced by chlorine- free refrigerant fluids because of the adverse effect of the chlorinated materials upon the atmospheric ozone layer. Tetrafluoroethane iso ers and in particular "Refrigerant 134a", which is 1,l,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, are now considered desirable fluids for use in refrigeration systems.Refrigeration working fluids are required to have a lubricant which is compatible and miscible with the refrigerant so that moving parts of the system are properly lubricated. Heretofore, such lubricants have 

 - 2 - been composed of hydrocarbon mineral oils which are miscible with the chlorine-containing refrigerant fluids and which provide effective lubrication.The use of tetrafluoroethane refrigerants has created a need for new lubricants, since mineral oils are not compatible with these materials. This need is well recognized in the art and there are numerous recent publications and patents disclosing various types of synthetic lubricants which are said to be compatible with tetrafluoroethane refrigerant fluids. Esters of polyols are being particularly emphasized as being suitable for use with the tetrafluoroethane refrigerants, especially Refrigerant 134a.U. S. Patent 5,021,179, issued June 4, 1991 to Zehler et al. , discloses esters of polyols in which the acyl groups have at least 22% of (a) branched acyl groups or (b) acyl groups which contain no more than six carbon atoms. This patent also indicates that the esters have a certain ratio of the
