<ABSTRACT>
In this device a leakproof receptacle (11) is equipped with at least one delivery conduit (12) and with an orifice (14) and includes an agitator (515) entirely contained in the receptacle (11). This allows products of a high viscosity to be mixed without excessive heating and without leakage, by virtue of the exclusive use of static leakproofing. Use for mixing viscous and/or fluid products at high pressures.

<CLAIMS>
Device for mixing viscous and/or fluid products
comprising a sealed container (11) equipped with at least one

feed conduit (12) for the products (2, 13) situated at one end
of the container and with at least one outlet orifice (14)

arranged at the opposite end of the container, said container
(11) being intended to receive the products to be mixed and

containing a stirrer (15) for mixing said products, said
stirrer being completely contained in the container (11),

characterised in that the stirrer (15) consists of a
cylindrical part (36) fixed on a manipulating arm (37) guided

by a first pivot system (38) in the region of one of the ends
of the arm (37) and by a second pivot system (40) at the other

end of the arm (37), said stirrer being set into a circular
translation movement by means of a cam (26) driven by a motor

(30).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
first pivot system (38) is an elastic washer which has

apertures and is fixed in the rigid portion of the container
(11).
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised
in that the second pivot system (40) arranged at one end of

the manipulating arm (37) connects said arm to a support (27)
having a protuberance (28) accommodated in the cam (26).
Device according to any one of claims 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that the manipulating arm (37) is contained

in a lower flexible portion (23) of the container (11).
Device according to any one of claims 1, 2 or 3, in which
a portion of the interior of the container containing the 

cylindrical part (36) has a truncated cone-shaped
configuration.
Device according to claim 5, in which the inlet orifice
is centred relative to the circular translation movement of

the manipulating arm connected to the cylindrical part of the
stirrer.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the outlet orifice is located

substantially in the extension of the stirrer.
Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which
a flexible tube (16) for transporting mixed product

originating from the outlet orifice (14) is arranged
substantially parallel to the flexible portion of the

container (11).
Installation for manufacturing parts of foamed material
comprising a tray (4) in contact with a sealed barrel (1)

equipped with at least one compressed gas feed conduit, a
purging conduit and an outlet conduit (12a) equipped with at

least one pump (6), said outlet conduit being connected to a
mixing device (10) supplying an extrusion nozzle (19), the

mixing device arranged stationarily relative to the tray of
the barrel corresponding to any one of the preceding claims.
Use of a device according to any one of claims 1 to 8 for
mixing products, under pressures of up to 300 bar, to form

parts of foamed material, preferably static gaskets deposited
in-situ or by transfer.
