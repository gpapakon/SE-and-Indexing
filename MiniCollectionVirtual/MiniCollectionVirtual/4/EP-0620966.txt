<ABSTRACT>
The drip irrigation unit (10) for insertion 
into a water supply pipe (2) for reducing the flow 

through an outlet opening (4, 6) in the water supply 
pipe (2), includes a cylindrical member of a deformable 

elastomeric material fixed within the water supply pipe 
(2). The cylindrical member is formed with an inlet 

opening (12) therethrough for conducting water from the 
interior of the water supply pipe (2) to the outer face 

of the cylindrical member, and an outlet cavity (14, 16) 
in the outer face of the cylindrical member alignable 

with the outlet opening (4, 6) in the water supply pipe 
(2). A regulated flow-reducing pathway between the inlet 

opening (12) and outlet cavity (14, 16) includes 
multiple, series-connected pressure-compensating 

chambers whose cross-sectional areas are changed by the 
deformation of the elastomeric cylindrical member to 

regulate the flow of the water in response to changes in 
the water supply pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to drip irrigation 
apparatus, and particularly to such apparatus effective to 
regulate the flow of the water therefrom in response to 
changes in the water supply pressure. One known construction of apparatus of this type 
includes a drip irrigation unit for insertion into a water 
supply pipe to reduce the flow through an outlet opening in 
the water supply pipe, comprising: a cylindrical member 
having an outer diameter substantially equal to the inner 
diameter of the water supply pipe and fixed therein with the 
outer face of the cylindrical member in contact with the 
inner face of the water supply pipe; the cylindrical member 
being formed with an inlet opening therethrough from its 
inner face to its outer face for conducting the water from 
the interior of the water supply supply pipe to the outer 
face of the cylindrical member, an outlet cavity in the 
outer face of the cylindrical member alignable with the 
outlet opening in the water supply pipe, and a regulated 
flow-reducing pathway between the inlet opening and outlet 
cavity. Examples of apparatus of this type of known 
construction are illustrated in US Patents 4,519,543 and 
4,687,143. In these known constructions, the cylindrical 
member is of rigid plastic material and includes a flexible 
membrane or the like to produce the regulation in response 
to changes in the water supply pressure. Since such 
constructions involve a multiplicity of parts, they are 
relatively expensive to produce and to assemble into the 
water supply pipe. US Patent 4,824,025 discloses a drip irrigation 
unit constituted of a cylindrical member made of a 
deformable elastomeric material in which the flow regulating 
means is a deformable tubular member diametrically 
traversing the cylinder, the tubular member being deformable 
by the fluid pressure in the conduit line to restrict the  
 
flow of fluid therethrough. In such a drip irrigation unit, 
however, the diametrically traversing tubular member also 
interferes with the flow of the water through the line, and 
thereby produces a pressure loss in the water flowing 
through the line. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a drip irrigation unit of the foregoing type 
characterized in that the cylindrical member is made of a 
deformable elastomeric material, and that the regulated 
flow-reducing pathway includes a plurality of series-connected 
multiple pressure-compensating chambers whose 
cross-sectional areas are changed by the deformation of the 
elastome

A drip irrigation unit for insertion into a 
water supply pipe for reducing the flow through an outlet 

opening in the water supply pipe, comprising a cylindrical 
member of a deformable elastomeric material having an outer 

diameter substantially equal to the inner diameter of the 
water supply pipe and fixed therein with the outer face of 

the cylindrical member in contact with the inner face of the 
water supply pipe; said cylindrical member being formed with 

an inlet opening therethrough from its inner face to its 
outer face for conducting the water from the interior of the 

water supply supply pipe to the outer face of the 
cylindrical member, an outlet cavity in the outer face of 

the cylindrical member alignable with the outlet opening in 
the water supply pipe, and a regulated flow-reducing pathway 

between said inlet opening and outlet cavity; characterized 
in that said regulated flow-reducing pathway includes 

multiple, series-connected pressure-compensating chambers 
whose cross-sectional areas are changed by the deformation 

of the elastomeric cylindrical member to regulate the flow 

of the water in response to changes in the water supply 
pressure.

multiple pressure-compensating chambers are constituted of a 

recess formation on the outer face of the cylindrical member 
and cooperable with the inner face of the water supply 

pipe. 
The unit according to Claim 2, wherein said 
recess formation includes a plurality of pairs of parallel 

spaced grooves connected in series, each pair being joined 
by a transverse groove of shallower depth to define, with 

the inner face of the water supply pipe, a restricted 
passageway having a cross-sectional area which is changed by 

the deformation of the elastomeric cylindrical member to 
regulate the flow of water in response to changes in the 

water supply pressure.

recess formation includes a plurality of grooves connected 

in series, each groove being bounded by a bottom face and a 
pair of side faces and including a flat-top projection 

integrally formed in said bottom face and of smaller height 
and thickness than the depth and width, respectively, of the 

groove to define, with the inner face of the water supply 
pipe, a restricted passageway having a cross-sectional area

cylindrical member to regulate the flow of water in response 

to changes in the water supply pressure.

recess formation includes a plurality of annular recesses 

connected in series, to define, with the inner face of the 
water supply pipe, a plurality of annular flowpaths each 

producing a cyclonic flow of the water therethrough and 
having a cross-sectional area which is changed by the 

deformation of the elastomeric cylindrical member to 
regulate the flow of water in response to changes in the 

water supply pressure. 
The unit according to Claim 4, wherein said 
regulated flow-reducing pathway further includes a bore 

extending transversely through a wall of the cylindrical 
member leading from a first point on its outer face to a 

second point on its outer face, said first point 
communicating with said recess formation, and said second 

point communicating with said outlet cavity, the cross-sectional
