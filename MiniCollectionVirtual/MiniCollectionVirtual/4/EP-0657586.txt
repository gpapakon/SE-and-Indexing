<ABSTRACT>
A maintenance vehicle (60), having a suction roller (80) designed as water-absorbing device, is used to prepare in an optimal condition a sports ground (11), in particular a natural-grass pitch, for football matches or the like. Said suction roller (80) has essentially a perforated drum-like roller (85) with a foam-rubber covering (90) surrounding the latter, a weight roller (87) lying approximately at the top on the roller (85) and arranged to be rotatable axially parallel thereto, and also a collecting trough (88) positioned in the roller (85) and having a conduit (93) leading into a water tank for the purpose of emptying said collecting trough. In addition, in the case of this maintenance vehicle (10), besides the suction roller (80), a scarifying unit (32), a surface roller (34) and a warm air-blowing device (50) for drying or airing the sports ground (11) are provided. Consequently, any rainwater on the sports ground can be removed in a very short time, football matches can be staged irrespective of the prevailing weather and the grounds can always be kept in an optimal condition.

sports facility comprising a water-receiving device for

removing water accumulated on the lawn, 
characterized in
that
 a lawn verticulator (32) is arranged in a distance
behind the water-receiving device (80) with respect to the

driving direction, which lawn verticulator is making a
plurality of depressions into the lawn which has been

previously extensively secured from water and that means
are provided to adjust individually the distance to the

ground of the water-receiving device secured to the vehicle
frame and the verticulator to a desired amount.
Maintenance vehicle according claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 a surface roller (34) is liftable arranged behind

coating (90) surrounding said suction roller, a netlike

textile skin (91) covering said coating, a weight roller
(87) lying approximately on top of the roller (85) and

being rotatably arranged axially parallel to said roller
(85), and a catching trough (88) arranged in the roller 

(85) with a pipeline (93) leading into a water tank for the
purpose of emptying the same.
Maintenance vehicle according claim 4, 
characterized
in that

(81) w
hich in turn is supported at each end on a respective
leaf spring (94) disposed transversally on the underside of

the vehicle and pivotally supported on same.
Maintenance vehicle according claim 4 or 5,

characterized in that
 the weight roller (87) lying on the
roller (85) extend approximately the full length of the

roller (85) and is rotatably supported at each end on a
respective lever (83) pivotally supported on the vehicle

(60).
Maintenance vehicle according to one of the claims 4
to 6, 
characterized in that
 the stationary catching through
(88) is held by the axle supporting the roller (85) an has

corresponding approximately with an inside diameter of the
roller (85).
Maintenance vehicle according claim 7, 
characterized
in that
 the opening (88') of the catching trough (88) is
constructed in a horizontal alignment above the axis of

rotation of the roller (85) during operation, and the base
of the trough (85) is arranged directly above the lower

curvature of the roller (85).
Maintenance vehicle according one of the claims 1 to
3, 
characterized in that
 the water receiving device
