<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the production of contact lenses of which the rear surface, at least in the marginal area, is aspherical, in particular toric, a contact lens blank (1) is inserted into a mounting (2) and firstly the rear surface of the contact lens is constructed by means of turning technology. Subsequent to the production of the rear surface, the front surface of the contact lens is constructed. Before the construction of the rear surface, the contact lens blank (1) which is inserted into the mounting (2) and is unstressed is elastically deformed in a main meridian, especially in the marginal area, and the rear surface is then constructed by means of turning technology on this deformed contact lens blank (1). After its construction, the contact lens is subsequently finally unstressed once more.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the manufacture of contact lenses with a rear face
which at least in the edge region is aspherical, in particular toric, in

which a contact lens blank (1) is fitted into a holder (2) and elastically
deformed in a principal meridian at least in the edge region, the rear face

of the contact lens is produced by means of turning on the deformed contact
lens blank (1) and the contact lens is released after production thereof,

characterised in that

for the purposes of elastic deformation the contact lens blank (1) is
pressed and fixed by a force (23) acting along the principal meridian and

perpendicularly thereto against a conical support surface (21), the contact
lens blank (1) not being deformed in the principal meridian which is

perpendicular thereto.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the released
contact lens blank (1) is elastically deformed at the edge in the one

principal meridian by the amount which corresponds to a sagittal height
difference (Î”h) which occurs in the case of a contact lens with a

predetermined central radius (R
1
) and a predetermined difference in respect
of the radii (R
1
-R
2
) in the two principal meridians at the edge of the rear
face.
A process according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised in that
the deformed contact lens blank (1) is glued fast to the holder (2) before

the operation of turning the rear face.
A process according to claim 3 characterised in that the contact
lens blank (1) has a stump (10) which is fitted into the holder and that the

holder has a substantially conically extending support surface, against 
which the part, adjoining the stump, of the contact lens blank (1) from

which the contact lens is produced is glued.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
after the rear face is produced the front face of the contact lens blank (1)

is produced on the contact lens blank when still deformed.
A process according to claim 5 characterised in that a holder (2)
is used which comprises a machinable material, preferably a material with

similar machining properties to the contact lens blank (1).
