<ABSTRACT>
Continual boron-doped diamond parts with ends are 
formed in a non-doped insulating diamond crystal. Ohmic 

electrodes are deposited on the ends of the boron-doped continual 
parts. Non-doped diamond encloses and insulates the boron-doped 

diamond. When the boron-doped diamond parts are supplied with a 
current, the boron-doped parts generate Joule's heat. The device 

acts as a heater. Since the whole is made of diamond crystal, the 
heater can be sized to extremely small. The heater enjoys high 

resistance against high temperature, especially in an anaerobic 
atmosphere. The diamond heater can be adopted in vacuum or in 

liquid, since the insulating diamond layers are highly resistant 
against vacuum and liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heater, and particularly but not exclusively to
a small-sized heater which can be used in a vacuum or a heater used in liquid
which requires insulation between the heater itself and the surrounding liquid.A heater is a device which generates heat when a current flows
therethrough. The resistance of the heater produces Joule's heat from the
current. Conventional heaters have adopted metal wires as a conduction
material for generating heat, for example, a nickrome (Ni-Cr) wire, a kanthal
(Fe-Cr-Al) wire, etc. Such metal wires are chemically stable and highly
resistant to oxidization even in high temperature surroundings. Furthermore,
the metal wires have enough electric resistance to apply a voltage for yielding
heat. The high-resistance metal wire heaters have 
been used for various purposes. The metal heaters are inexpensive
in general. Metal heaters can be used in the state of a bare wire,
when they are only in contact with an insulator and air.Metal wires must be enclosed, however, by mica plates
or a quartz tube for insulating the metal from the surroundings.
Since a mica plate is planar, the heater wire must be sandwiched
between two sheets of mica for insulation. In the case of the
insulation by quartz, the wire must be inserted into a quartz (SiO2)
tube. The quartz tube protects and insulates the metal wire heater
from the environment. The enclosures of quartz or mica enlarge
the volume or the area of the heater at least by the thickness of
the enclosures. The enclosure makes the heater bulky by
increasing its volume. The necessity of the additional enclosure
makes it difficult to produce a small-sized heater.The metal heater cannot be heated at a temperature
higher than the melting point of the material metal. The melting
points of the heater metals are about 2000Â°C at most. In general,
the melting points of metals are far lower than the melting points
of oxides.Nevertheless the melting point does not determine the
upper limit of the temperature available for a heater. Enclosures 
are another factor of determining the upper limit of the heater temperature.
Enclosing the resistance wire by mica, quartz or other insulating medium
reduces the heat conductivity. Poor conductivity raises the temperature
difference between a cental wire radiator and an outer surface of the
enclosures. The highest temperature of the radiator wire must be lower than
the melting point of the insulator. Thus the surface temperature of the
insulator of the metal heater is generally less than
