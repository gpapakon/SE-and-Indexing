<ABSTRACT>
The sorting exit contains a vertical fall duct (4) and, following this, a guide duct (10) which leads to a collecting container. The fall duct (4) opens into a deflection part (11) which forms part of the guide duct (10) and consists of at least two deflection surfaces (13) inclined in relation to one another and to the fall duct. Preferably, the collecting containers are arranged in three planes one above the other and corresponding sorting exits (S1, S2, S3) are provided in the three planes. Use for sorting photographic order bags, the order bags being deposited in the collecting containers in an ordered stack.

<CLAIMS>
Sorting equipment exit with a vertical drop duct (4) and
with a guide duct (10) adjoining the latter to guide goods

for sorting which have been thrown into the drop duct from
a transport container into a collecting container (5),


characterised in that
 the drop duct (4) leads into a
deflector part (11) which forms part of the guide duct (10)

and which consists of at least two deflector surfaces (13)
inclined with respect to one another and with respect to

the drop duct and lying in the region of the drop duct,
wherein the goods for sorting, which fall upright into the

deflector part (11), are turned by the first oblique
deflector surface about the direction of descent.
Sorting equipment exit according to claim 1,

characterised in that
, following the deflector part (11),
the guide duct (10) comprises a discharge part (12) in the

form of a channel with a flat bottom.
Sorting equipment exit according to claim 2,

characterised in that
 the collecting containers (5) are
disposed at least at two, preferably at three levels, and

that sorting exits (S) are provided with the discharge part
(12) at the corresponding levels and drop ducts (4) of

different heights, and that three sorting exits (S
1
, S
2
, S
3
)
with drop ducts of different heights are in each case

combined to form an exit group.
Sorting equipment exit according to claim 3,

characterised in that
 the deflector part (11) of the two
upper sorting exits (S
1
, S
2
) consists of two and that of the
lower sorting exit (S
3
) of three deflector surfaces.
Sorting equipment exit according to claim 4,

characterised in that
 at the deflector surfaces (13) the
goods for sorting rotate about their axes lying in the

direction of descent, are swung out of their vertical plane 
and are stabilised and brought into alignment with the

discharge part (12).
Sorting equipment exit according to one of claims 1
to 5, 
characterised in that
 the guide duct (10) branches
off the drop duct (4) at an oblique angle (α) and is in the

form of a channel.
Sorting equipment exit according to claims 6 and 3,

characterised in that
 the said angle (α) increases with the
length of the drop duct (4).
Sorting equipment exit according to one of claims 1
to 5, 
characterised in that
 this is preferably made of
glass fibre-reinforced polyester.
