<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-processor system, and more 
particularly to a multi-processor system which may be upgraded from a single-processor 
system merely by the insertion of an additional processor. With the rapid pace of development in central processing unit (CPU) 
technology, obsolescence is a problem to both the manufacturers and the users of 
personal computers. A product which employs state of the art technology at the time its 
initial marketing may become obsolete within only a year or less. Personal computers 
employing 80286 CPUs are current examples. These obsolete computer systems remain 
operable, but often lack the capability of running software designed for use with systems 
having more advanced CPUs. In order to run such software on their existing hardware, 
users are forced to upgrade their systems, and in the process are faced with the following 
questions: Given a particular system's application, what level of upgrade is required to 
keep abreast of the current developments in processor and software technology (e.g., 
would an 80386 provide sufficient computing power, or is an upgrade to a more 
powerful processor, an 80486 or p5 for example, necessary)? What is the most 
economical way to expand a computer system from a single-processor system to a multi-processor 
computer system in the event that the computing power of a single processor 
system is insufficient? There are existing alternatives to the impractical solution of buying a new 
computer each time a new CPU is developed. One solution involves replacing the circuit 
board (i.e., mother board or an extended printed circuit board) upon which the system 
CPU is located with another circuit board having a more sophisticated CPU. 
Unfortunately, this alternative is not only expensive, it may also be inconvenient in that 
the user often must contact the original retailer or manufacturer to effect the replacement. 
A second solution involves providing a specially designed CPU circuit board in the 
original system on which a prepared location (e.g., an IC socket) is provided for 
inserting a second CPU when the original CPU on the board requires an upgrade. Upon 
insertion of the new CPU into the prepared location, the original CPU is disabled. Such  
 
a specially designed circuit board is described in copending U.S. Patent Application 
Serial No. 07/872,611 for Upgradeable/Downgradeable Central Processing Unit Chip 
Computer System, filed on April 22, 1992, and copending U.S. Patent Application Serial 
No.
