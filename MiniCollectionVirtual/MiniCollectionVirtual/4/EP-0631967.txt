<ABSTRACT>
The traction sheave elevator comprises an 
elevator car (1) moving along elevator guide 

rails (10), a counterweight (2) moving along 
counterweight guide rails (11), a set of 

hoisting ropes (3) on which the elevator car 
and the counterweight are suspended, and a 

drive machine unit (6) comprising a traction 
sheave (7) driven by the drive machine and 

engaging the hoisting ropes (3). The drive 
machine unit (6) of the elevator is placed in 

the top part of the elevator shaft (15) in the 
space between the shaft space needed by the 

elevator car on its path and/or its overhead 
extension and a wall of the elevator shaft 

(15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a traction sheave
elevator as defined in the preamble of claim 1.One of the objectives in elevator development work
has been an efficient and economic utilization of building
space. In conventional traction-sheave driven elevators,
the elevator machine room or other space reserved
for the drive machinery takes up a considerable portion
of the building space needed for the elevator. The problem
is not only the volume of the building space needed
for the drive machinery, but also its location in the building.
There are numerous solutions to the placement of
the machine room, but they generally significantly
restrict the design of the building at least in respect of
space utilization or appearance. For example, a
machine room placed on the roof of a building can be
felt to be a flaw of appearance. Being a special space,
the machine room generally involves increased building
costs.In prior art, hydraulic elevators are relatively advantageous
with respect to utilization of space, and they
often allow the entire drive machine to be placed in the
elevator shaft. However, hydraulic elevators are only
applicable in cases where the lifting height is one floor
or at most a few floors. In practice, hydraulic elevators
cannot be constructed for very large heights.JP utility model publication 4-50297 discloses a
machineroomless rucksack-type elevator (small type
elevator) wherein the drive unit is mounted on the heads
of the guide rails. However, as the base surface of the
drive machine unit is rather large, a large distance has
to be provided between the cabin path and the shaft
wall. This necessitates a larger base surface of the elevator
shaft and therefore higher investments with
respect to the building costs.To meet the need to achieve a reliable elevator
which is advantageous in respect of economy and
space utilization and for which the space requirement in
the building, irrespective of the hoisting height, is substantially
limited to the space required by the elevator
car and counterweight on their paths including the
safety distances and the space needed for the hoisting
ropes, and in which the above-mentioned drawbacks
can be avoided, a new type of traction sheave elevator
is presented as an invention. The traction sheave elevator
of the invention is characterized by what is presented
in claim 1. Other embodiments
of the invention are characterized by the features
presented in the other claims.The advantages which can be achieved by applying
the present invention include the
