bonded to silicon atoms in each molecule, (D) phenyl 

group-containing diorganopolysiloxane of which the 
viscosity is 1-1000 mm2/S (centistoke) at 25°C, and (E)

platinum catalyst and a non-silicone thermoplastic 

resin having a glass transition point in the 
temperature range of 50-200°C and a particle size 0.01-20 

µm, where the amount of the platinum catalyst is 
0.01-5 weight percent as platinum metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a thermosetting silicone rubber
composition suitable for pressurized molding
applications such as press molding, transfer molding,
and injection molding, and also in extrusion molding.In these molding methods, organic peroxide is used
as the curing promoter for silicone rubber compositions
of the millable type. While these compositions have
excellent storage stability and a long working time which
makes handling easier, they exhibit poor mold-releasing
behavior when subjected to pressurized molding. This
causes problems of rubber tears at the release stage,
and metal mold contamination by undervulcanization
(caused by vulcanization impediment by oxygen in air) of
burrs of the moldings. Also, in extrusion molding,
there has been a problem of surface adhesion caused by
vulcanization impediment on the molding surface, and a
dusting agent such as talc is often required. To solve
these problems, a method has been proposed to add metal
salts of a fatty acid, such as calcium stearate, zinc
stearate, and the like, as an internal mold-releasing
agent. However, it has not provided a solution to
problems such as the undervulcanization of burrs of
moldings.Silicone rubber compositions which cure by
addition reaction with a platinum catalyst have been
developed recently and are also used in a wide range of
applications.Addition reaction silicone rubber compositions are
mainly injection molded since they are in a liquid
state, and this makes it possible to lower molding
temperatures (130°C-150°C), shorten curing times (0.5
minutes-2 minutes), and eliminate curing impediments.
However, the addition reaction between the reactants 
comprising a vinyl group-containing diorganopolysiloxane
and an organohydrogenpolysiloxane starts at
room temperature when the curing promoter catalyst is
added. As curing proceeds, its usable time is
extremely shortened, and it is absolutely impossible to
package it in a single container.Consequently, addition reaction silicone rubber
compositions cannot be readily used as a pressure
molding composition. One has to adopt a method in
which the composition containing the organohydrogenpolysiloxane
and the curing promoter catalyst are
isolated in separate containers. Just prior to
pressure molding, the contained ingredients are mixed
and the mixture is immediately pressure molded. This
has been a disadvantage because such handling is
troublesome.A method has been proposed to use a fine particle
catalyst, consisting of platinum and a phenyl group-containing
silicone resin, as
