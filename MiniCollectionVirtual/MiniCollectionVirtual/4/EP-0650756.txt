<ABSTRACT>
The invention/novelty relates to a support cage for glass-fibre tube filters for gas filtration, a predetermined number of elongate, essentially parallel support elements extending between a closed base plate and a cover plate having a central outlet orifice of the support cage, which support elements are surrounded by and support a tubular filter medium made of a glass-fibre cloth or glass-fibre nonwoven web, characterised in that the support elements are tubes, the radii of curvature of which are chosen in such a way that flat support regions are formed on each of the tube peripheral surfaces which are of sufficient size for the filter medium applied to the support cage.
