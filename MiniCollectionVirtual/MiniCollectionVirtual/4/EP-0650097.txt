<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic toner is formed from a binder 
resin and silicon-containing magnetic iron oxide 

particles. The magnetic toner has a weight-average 
particle size of at most 13.5 µm, and the magnetic 

toner has a particle size distribution such that 
magnetic toner particles having a particle size of at 

least 12.7 µm are contained in an amount of at most 50 
wt. %. The magnetic iron oxide particles have a 

silicon content of 0.4 - 2.0 wt. % based on iron, and 
the magnetic iron oxide particles have an Fe/Si atomic 

ratio of 1.2 - 4.0 at the utmost surfaces thereof. 
Because of the use of such magnetic iron oxide 

particles having a specifically controlled overall and 
surface Si contents, the magnetic toner can show 

stable performances even after standing in a high 
humidity environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
toner for visualizing electrostatic images in image
forming methods, such as electrophotography and
electrostatic recording, a process cartridge including
such a magnetic toner, and an image forming method
using the magnetic toner.Hitherto, a large number of electrophotographic
processes have been known, as disclosed
in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,297,691; 3,666,363; 4,071,361
and others. In these processes, an electric latent
image is formed on a photosensitive member comprising
a photoconductive material by various means, then the
latent image is developed and visualized with a toner,
and the resultant toner image is, after transferred
onto a transfer material, such as paper, as desired,
fixed by heating, pressing, heating and pressing,
etc., to obtain a copy or a print.Various developing methods for visualizing
electrostatic latent images with toner have also been
known. For example, there have been known the
magnetic brush method as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
2,874,063; the cascade developing method as disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 2,618,552; the powder cloud method 
as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,221,776; in
addition, the fur brush developing method; and the
liquid developing method. Among these developing
methods, those developing methods using a developer
composed mainly of a toner and a carrier such as the
magnetic brush method, the cascade process and the
liquid developing method have been widely used
commercially. While these methods provide good images
relatively stably, they involve common problems
accompanying the use of two-component developers, such
as deterioration of carriers and change in mixing
ratio of the toner and carrier.In order to obviate such problems, various
developing methods using a one-component developer
consisting only of a toner, have been proposed. Among
these, there are many excellent developing methods
using developers comprising magnetic toner particles.U.S. Patent No. 3,909,258 has proposed a
developing method using an electroconductive magnetic
toner, wherein an electroconductive magnetic toner is
carried on a cylindrical electroconductive sleeve
provided with a magnet inside thereof and is caused to
contact an electrostatic image-bearing member having
an electrostatic image to effect development. In this
method, as the development zone, an electroconductive
path is formed with magnetic toner particles between
the recording member surface and the sleeve surface 
and the toner particles are attached to image portions
due to a
