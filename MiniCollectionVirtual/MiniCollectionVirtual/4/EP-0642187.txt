<ABSTRACT>
A circular-linear polarizer comprising a waveguide and a one-quarter 
wave length plate installed on the inside wall of the 

waveguide having a close junction between them, the inside wall of 
the waveguide having a flat part for the flat junction surface of 

the one-quarter wave length plate, or the junction surface of the 
one quarter wqve length plate having a circular cross section for 

a circular inside cross section of the waveguide, improving the 
electrical contact between them and the cross polarization and 

axial ratio while keeping the good impedance characteristic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circular-linear polarizer used
for transmission or reception of the microwave electromagnetic
wave, and, more particularly, to a waveguide provided with a one-quarter
wave length plate with excellent contacting therebetween
and favourable impedance characteristics, cross polarization and
axial ratio.Circularly polarized electromagnetic waves which proceed
with the electric field vector rotating are widely used in the
transmission in the microwave band, as the setting of aerial
therefor is easy.In the following, referring to the drawings a circular-linear
polarizer of prior art is explained. Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 show a
circular-linear polarizer of prior art, the former being a
sectional view seen from the direction of the axis of the
waveguide (direction of the electromagnetic wave transmission)
and the latter being a side section cut by a cutting line S4-S4.
As shown, the prior art circular-linear polarizer consists of a
waveguide 6 of circular section and a 1/4 wave length phase plate
1 of metal for generating the phase difference of 1/4 wave 
length. The 1/4 wave length phase plate 1 is, as shown in Fig. 17, trapezoid
with a certain thickness, and is mounted with the flat end surface on the
inside of the waveguide (in Fig. 13, on the upper side) in the direction of
waveguide by screws 5 or such. In such a structure, however, as shown in
the partially enlarged section of Fig. 13(b), the phase plate 1 and the circular
inside surface 4 of the circular waveguide 6 contact only by the two edges
of the end surface of the plate with a gap in between, resulting in a very
small contact surface and incomplete grounding, so that favourable input
impedance characteristic or cross polarization characteristic were difficult to
obtain.Further, a small discrepancy of the position of the phase plate 1
led to a considerable deterioration of the cross polarization characteristics,
and difficulty in obtaining a stable characteristics.To constitute a circular-linear polarizer with a phase plate of
dielectrics instead of metal is possible. In this case, however, similar
difficulties still arose for the exact positioning of the phase plate; the gap and
small inexact positioning brought the variation of the characteristics.Thus, in assembly process, adjustment of the mounting position
of the phase plate was often necessary.US-A-4,195,270 discloses a dielectric slab polarizer comprising 
a waveguide whose cross-sectional shape is circular or square and a slab of
dielectric material. The surface of
