<ABSTRACT>
A teleoperator system with telepresence is shown which includes right and left hand controllers (72R and 72L) for control of right and left manipulators (24R and 24L) through use of a servomechanism that includes computer (42). Cameras (46R and 46L) view workspace (30) from different angles for production of stereoscopic signal outputs at lines (48R and 48L). In response to the camera outputs a 3-dimensional top-to-bottom inverted image (30I) is produced which, is reflected by mirror (66) toward the eyes of operator (18). A virtual image (30V) is produced adjacent control arms (76R and 76L) which is viewed by operator (18) looking in the direction of the control arms. By locating the workspace image (30V) adjacent the control arms (76R and 76L) the operator is provided with a sense that end effectors (40R and 40L) carried by manipulator arms (34R and 34L) and control arms (76R and 76L) are substantially integral. This sense of connection between the control arms (76R and 76L) and end effectors (40R and 40L) provide the operator with the sensation of directly controlling the end effectors by hand. By locating visual display (246) adjacent control arms (244R and 244L) image (240I) of the workspace is directly viewable by the operator (Figs. 12 and 13). Use of the teleoperator system for surgical procedures is also disclosed (Figs. 7-9 and 13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to teleoperator 
system and a method according to the preambles of claims 1 and 15, and 
particularly to those which 
include means for providing the operator of remote 
apparatus with the same sense as working directly with 
his hands at the worksite. Teleoperating, which is well known, includes the 
human performance of tasks at a remote location using 
manipulators. Telepresense includes providing the 
teleoperator with the same feedback and control that he 
would have were he actually at the worksite carrying out 
the operation with his own hands. Telepresence operation 
generally includes use of a stationary visual display, 
particularly a stereographic visual display of the remote 
workspace. Stereoscopic television systems are well 
known as shown, for example, in U.S. Patent Numbers 
4,562,463 and 4,583,117 and in U.K. Patent Application 
GB 2,040,134. Remote manipulators employing stereoscopic TV 
viewing together with force feedback also are well known 
as shown, for example, in an article entitled, 
"Controlling Remote Manipulators Through Kinesthetic 
Coupling," Bejczy et al, Computers in Mechanical 
Engineering, July 1983, pps. 48-60, and in an article 
entitled, "Stereo Advantage for a Peg-In-Hole Task Using 
a Force-Feedback Manipulator" by E.H. Spain, SPIE Vol. 
1256 Stereoscopic Displays and Applications, 1990, pps.  
 
244-254. In the Bejczy et al article, force-torque feedback is disclosed. Also, in US 
Patent No. 3,921,445, a manipulator which includes force, torque and slip sensors of 
a type which may be employed with the present invention is shown. A tele-existence master slave system which defines the closest prior art, is 
disclosed in an article entitled "Tele-Existence 
Master Slave System for Remote Manipulation (II)", Tachi, et al., 
Proceedings of the 29th Conference on Decision and Control, Vol. 1 of 6, pp. 85-90. 
The system comprises a master system with a visual and auditory sensation of 
presence, computer control system and an anthropomorphic slave robot mechanism 
with an arm having seven degrees of freedom. The operator's head and arm 
movements are measured by the master motion measurement system in real time. 
Signals are then sent to four computers which generate a command position of the 
slave head and arm movements to correspond with the operator's head and arm 
movements. Even though the operator of prior art manipulators is provided with a stationary 
three-dimensional image of the workspace, and manual controllers for
