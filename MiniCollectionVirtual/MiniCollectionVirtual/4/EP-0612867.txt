<ABSTRACT>
The gas emission ring pipe 50 is positioned 
concentrically with the rectifying cylinder 38 connected at 

the upper end to the opening at the upper end of the main 
chamber 12 and aligned concentrically with the single crystal 

36 pulled up. A plurality of holes 50a for gas emission are 
formed on the inner side of the ring pipe 50 in the direction 

of the radius. The inert gas G1 flows down inside the 
rectifying cylinder 38 and the
 cooling inert gas G2 is 
supplied via the gas delivery pipe 52 from outside of the 

main chamber 12 into the ring pipe 50. Since the cooling 
inert gas G2 is emitted through the emission holes 50a of the 

ring pipe 50, the lower portion of the single crystal can be 
cooled safely and efficiently and the vertical temperature 

gradient of the single crystal 36 near the solid/liquid 
interface is steeper, resulting in improved growth rate of 

the single crystal 36.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inert gas 
rectifying/blowing apparatus for a single crystal pulling 
device, which rectifies the flow of inert gas with a 
rectifying cylinder positioned concentrically with the 
growing single crystal and which also blows upon the lower 
part of the single crystal with cooling inert gas. When growing an Si single crystal by pulling it up 
from an Si melt in a quartz crucible, volatile SiO is 
generated by the reaction between the quartz crucible and the 
Si melt. This SiO is deposited on the edge of the crucible, 
the Si single crystal, the pull shaft and the inner wall of 
the chamber. The SiO which is deposited on the pull shaft 
that is raised while rotating, is scraped off by the sealing 
ring for airtightness at the upper lid, and falls into the 
melt below. This causes defects in the growing single 
crystal. To deal with this problem, a method in which a 
rectifying cylinder is hung down concentrically with the pull 
shaft over the melt surface into which Ar gas is injected 
from above so that it will flow down into the rectifying 
cylinder causing the SiO which has evaporated from the melt 
surface to be discharged from the lower part of the chamber  
 
along with the Ar gas, has been disclosed (Second Publication 
No. 54-6511 of Japanese Patent Application). Another method, which attempts to create an effect 
similar to that provided by a rectifying cylinder without 
actually providing a rectifying cylinder has also been 
disclosed, in which a ring pipe formed with a plurality of 
holes on its outer side in the direction of the radius is 
provided concentrically with the single crystal 36 over the 
melt surface. Ar gas is supplied to this ring pipe to be 
emitted toward the outside in the direction of the radius 
through these holes, and at the same time, Ar gas is flown 
down from above (First Publication No. 4-46088 of Japanese 
Patent Application). Another method has been disclosed in which the 
vertical temperature gradient of the single crystal near the 
solid/liquid interface is increased to improve the crystal 
growth rate by adding a collar, which is formed by folding 
the lower end of the rectifying cylinder outward and upward 
(First Publication No. 64-65086 of Japanese Patent 
Application). In contrast, alternative methods to adding a collar 
to the lower end of the rectifying cylinder wherein Ar gas 
that has been cooled with liquid nitrogen is inducted into 
the rectifying cylinder to flow downward (First Publication 
No. 53-8374 of Japanese
