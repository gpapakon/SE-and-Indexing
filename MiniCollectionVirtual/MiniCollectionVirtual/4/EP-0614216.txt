<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
forming oxide film, and a heat treatment apparatus such as a 
sintering apparatus which are generally used for, for 
example, a semiconductor manufacturing process. Moreover, the present invention relates to a 
semiconductor device and its manufacturing method, 
particularly to a semiconductor device and its manufacturing 
method capable of forming an oxide film/silicon interface 
with a high reliability. Conventionally, for example, a heat oxidation furnace 
system is constituted so as to bring gaseous matter and 
water vapor into contact with a heated silicon substrate by 
introducing a mixed gas of oxygen gas and hydrogen gas into 
a furnace tube comprising a quartz tube heated by means of 
the electrical resistance heating method to burn the 
hydrogen and thereby generate water vapor, in order to form 
an oxide film on the surface of the silicon substrate. For the existing system, however, because the 
introduced hydrogen gas burns at the tip of the quartz tube  
 
serving as the furnace tube, the tip of the quartz tube is 
melted, many particles are produced, and the particles cause 
the silicon substrate to be contaminated. In this case, to form an oxide film with a high 
reliability, the furnace tube for taking charge of an 
oxidation process must not be contaminated by the particles 
but it should be cleaned as soon as possible. To manufacture an electrically stable semiconductor 
device, it is also necessary to remove the particles from 
the silicon substrate as soon as possible. Therefore, super-cleaning of a thermal oxide film 
forming process is indispensable to obtain a super-fine LSI. The present invention is made to solve the above 
problem and its object is to provide a apparatus for forming 
oxide film allowing wet oxidation treatment to form an oxide 
film with a high reliability on a substrate in a furnace 
tube. The prior art is described below by taking a sintering 
apparatus for terminating a dangling bond on oxide 
film/silicon interface by hydrogen as an example. As this type of sintering apparatus, an apparatus is 
hitherto known which is constituted so as to terminate a 
dangling bond by hydrogen by introducing hydrogen gas or a 
mixed gas of an inert gas and hydrogen gas into a furnace 
tube comprising a quartz tube heated by the electrical 
resistance heating method and bringing the gas into contact 
with an oxide film/silicon substrate.  Moreover, an apparatus is also known which is 
constituted so as to terminate a dangling
