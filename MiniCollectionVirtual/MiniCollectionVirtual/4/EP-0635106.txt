<ABSTRACT>
Described is an inexpensive method of producing a sleeve-shaped friction bearing (8), as well as the friction bearing (8) thus produced. In the first step in the method, a thin to extremely thin lubrication film (4) of a suitable polymer with good lubrication properties is applied to a mandrel (1) by plastics-technology techniques and the film (4) covered, while on the mandrel (1), with a support layer (6) of hard or flexible polymer. The lubricating film (4) has at least one slit (7) in it.

A method of production of a slide bearing (8) in the form of a sleeve 
and having a sliding face pointing at the axis (R) of rotation, a 

sliding layer (4) consisting of a polymeric material exhibiting good 
sliding properties, produced by methods in plastics technology, and a 

carrier (6) surrounding this sliding layer and likewise of polymeric 
material, the sliding layer (4) exhibiting towards the carrier (6) a depression 

(7, 7A) which extends in parallel with the axis (R) of rotation 
and is filled with the carrier material, characterized by 

the combined application of the following steps of the method: 

producing an inner thin sliding layer (4) of a first polymeric 
material on a core by a process of injection moulding, transfer 

moulding or injection blast; 
employing a material for the sliding layer (4) without addition 
of fibrous, spherical and/or particulate abrasive fillers; 
generating at least one longitudinal slit (7) extending 
from one endface of the sliding layer (4) to the other 

endface or at least one longitudinal parting (7a) whilst 
leaving an elastic web (23) in the form of a skin (24) 

during or after the production of the sliding layer (4); 
sheathing the inner sliding layer (4) lying on or applied to 
the core (1) or a core part (1a), with the outer carrier (6) 

of either hard or soft-elastic polymer, the conduct of the 
process and/or the construction of the inner sliding layer (4) 

and of the outer carrier (6) being chosen in such a way 
that the inner sliding layer (4) is connected in self-substance 

and/or positively to the outer carrier (6); and 
the longitudinal slits (7) or longitudinal partings (7a) 
becoming filled with the material of the carrier (6); 
stripping the sheathed and inherently stabilized sliding bearing (8) 
from the core (1 or 1a) a
nd subsequently discarding the latter. 
A method as in Claim 1, characterized in that 
in the case of only partial separation of the sliding layer (4) the 

web or webs remaining at the parting or partings (7a) is/are made as 
membrane (24).

the thickness of the membrane or membranes (24) is dimensioned at less 
than one millimetre.

the carrier (6) is made of at least two layers (6.1; 6.2; 6.3) of 

alternately hard and softly elastic polymer, applied alternately one 
above the other and connected in self-substance and/or positively 

together or vice versa.
