<ABSTRACT>
In a wavelength multiplexed optical transmission system 
incorporating a concatenation of optical amplifiers (13, 15) the 

multiplexed signal passes through a limited number of amplifiers (13) 
in which all channels are amplified together, after which, at the next 

amplifier (15), the signal is demultiplexed, each channel is separately 
amplified, and then the channels are remultiplexed.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is known that in an optical transmission system it is possible to insert
an optical amplifier or a concatenation of such amplifiers in the
transmission path between an optical transmitter and its co-operating
receiver in order to extend the range of the system. Such a
concatenation is for instance described in EP 0 440 276 A. In this
instance a communication channel is wavelength multiplexed with a
service channel. At each amplifier it is only the communication
channel that is optically amplified. The service channel is
demultiplexed from the communication channel upstream of each
amplifier, is detected, electronically amplified, and converted back into
an optical signal before being remultiplexed with the communication
channel downstream of the optical amplifier.It is also known, for instance from JP 3 269 522, that optical amplifiers
can be used to amplify wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) signals.
In the instance of JP 3 269 522, the spectral width of the WDM signal
is too broad for amplification by a single amplifier, and so the WDM
signal is demultiplexed into separate wavebands, each of which is
separately amplified by an optical amplifier that has an amplification
bandwidth sufficient to amplify that particular separated waveband,
and then the amplified wavebands are remultiplexed.EP 0 242 802 A discloses an optical transmission system in which
there is a concatenation of optical amplifiers in the transmission path,
these amplifiers being used to amplify a WDM signal whose spectral
bandwidth is narrow enough to lie entirely within the amplification band
of a single optical amplifier. This specification is particularly concerned
with problems of excessive amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) 
liable to be encountered in systems having a large amplification
bandwidth. To overcome this problem, after each amplifier, the WDM
signal is demultiplexed, filtered and then remultiplexed.A single optical signal channel can be transmitted through a cascade
of quite a number of optical amplifiers before it requires full
regeneration. The spectral gain characteristic of a typical optical
amplifier, such as an erbium doped fibre amplifier, is wide enough to
support amplification of several wavelength multiplexed signal
channels. However the spectral gain characteristic is not entirely
uniform over its full usable spectral range. Thus an erbium doped fibre
amplifier may show a significant peak in its gain characteristic near the
short wavelength end of that characteristic. The use of filters to flatten
