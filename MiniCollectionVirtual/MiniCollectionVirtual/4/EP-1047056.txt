<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
information recording medium for high density recording
having a phase-change type recording layer, such as a
rewritable DVD, and an optical recording method.
Particularly, it relates to an optical information
recording medium and an optical recording method, whereby
the linear velocity dependency and the recording power
dependency at the time of one-beam overwriting and the
stability with time of recorded marks, are improved.With a compact disk (CD) or DVD, it is common that
recording of binary signals and detection of tracking
signals are carried out by utilizing a change in
reflectance caused by interference of reflected lights
from the mirror surface and the bottom of pits.In recent years, phase-change type rewritable
compact disks (CD-RW, CD-Rewritable) have been widely
used as media interchangeable with CD. Further, also
with respect to DVD, various proposals have been made for
phase-change type rewritable DVD.Such phase-change type rewritable CD and DVD utilize
a change in the phase difference and the difference in
reflectance caused by a difference in the refractive 
index as between an amorphous state and a crystalline
state for detecting recording information signals. A
usual phase-change medium has a structure comprising a
substrate, and a lower protective layer, a phase-change
recording layer, an upper protective layer and a
reflective layer, formed on the substrate, whereby
multiple interference of these layers can be utilized to
control the difference in reflectance and the phase
difference and to provide CD or DVD with
interchangeability.With CD-RW, within a range where the reflectance is
lowered to a level of from 15 to 25%, interchangeability
with a CD in the recording signals and the groove signals
can be secured, and retrieving can be carried out by a CD
drive having an amplifying system added in order to
complement the low reflectance.With a phase-change recording medium, erasing and
rewriting can be carried out simply by modulating the
intensity of a single laser beam. Accordingly, with a
phase-change recording medium such as CD-RW or rewritable
DVD, recording includes overwriting wherein recording and
erasing are carried out at the same time.For information recording utilizing a phase-change,
it is possible to employ a crystal state, an amorphous
state or a mixed state thereof, and a plurality of
crystal phases may also be used. However, with
rewritable phase-change recording media which are 
presently practically used, it is common that
