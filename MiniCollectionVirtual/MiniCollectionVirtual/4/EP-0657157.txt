<ABSTRACT>
A hair styling aid containing a mixture of an 
alkyl alcohol solvent having more than one and less than 

five carbon atoms; a film forming copolymeric or 
terpolymeric resin; water; a volatile short chain linear or 

cyclic alkylmethylsilicone fluid; with the remainder of the 
mixture being materials such as neutralizers, perfumes and 

fragrances. The styling aid is characterized by being free 
of a plasticizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a plasticizer free 
of styling aid, low volatile organic compounds (VOC) 
content, containing a volatile short chain linear or cyclic 
silicone fluid having in the molecule methyl and alkyl 
groups which include six, seven or eight carbon atoms. Styling aids for hair are marketed in many types 
and categories and the simplest form of a styling aid is 
hairspray. These products are applied to dry hair after it 
has been arranged in a finished hairstyle. Hairsprays are 
designed to hold hair in place by a methodology which 
includes (i) a coating of each hair with a thin deposit of 
stiff polymer, and (ii) a gluing of the hairs together at 
points where they cross. Solvents contained in these 
products evaporate rapidly and the holding effect is 
instantaneous. The main ingredients of hairspray are (i) a 
polymer which is a film forming resin; (ii) a solvent or 
solvent system; (iii) a plasticizer for the polymer; (iv) a 
neutralizer for the polymer; (v) a perfume; and (vi) 
adjuvants. Early hairsprays relied upon shellac as the 
polymer, but this lacquer has now been replaced by modern 
synthetic film forming resinous materials. These materials 
include homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, 
quadripolymers and quaternized resins. In actual practice, there is really only one 
solvent for non-aerosol hairsprays and that solvent is 
ethanol. Ethanol can be used alone or diluted with water. 
It possesses a rapid evaporation rate, an inoffensive odor 
which is easily masked by a perfume and excellent solvent 
properties for most resins. Its reasonable price is also  
 
attractive to formulators of consumer oriented product 
lines. For example, the European Community has 
standardized throughout their common market, an ethanol 
which is denatured with denatonium benzoate and is marked 
with tert-butyl alcohol. The addition of water to the 
solvent system of a hairspray may be necessary, to improve 
the solubility of a hairspray ingredient which is not fully 
soluble in ethanol or to retard the evaporation rate in some 
specialty product lines. Under current United States 
environmental regulations, water can become an even more 
important part of the solvent package, since its inclusion 
falls under the category of non-VOC ingredients. A plasticizer is used in a hairspray in a small 
quantity of about 0.5 percent by weight, to modify the 
properties of the film forming polymer resin, to make it 
more flexible. These materials include various types of 
liquid esters, proteins,
