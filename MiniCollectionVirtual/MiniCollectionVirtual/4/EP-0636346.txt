<ABSTRACT>
Hip joints are reinforced preventively by a device 
composed of a tubular element (5) fashioned from 

biocompatible material, accommodated by a socket 
(6) drilled in the femoral bone (1) parallel with 

and ajacent to an axis (X1) connecting the ball (2) 
and the diaphysis (4), and two independent locking 

assemblies (7, 8) operating unidirectionally and in 
mutual opposition, also of biocompatible material, 

by which the tubular element (5) can be deformed 
and manipulated in such a manner as to lodge stably 

in the surrounding bone tissue of the socket (6), 
establishing a load-bearing axis (A) that functions 

as a bridge between the weaker axis (X1) and the 
main axis (X2) of the femur.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the 
preventive support of femoral regions. It has been observed in the medical world, and in 
particular the orthopaedic branch of medicine, that 
the number of hospitalization cases involving bone 
fractures has risen considerably over recent years, 
with a large proportion of such fractures affecting 
the hip region. One reason for a greater abundance of fractures is 
to be found in the increasing growth of the elderly 
population, and therefore in a higher incidence of 
osteoporosis, i.e. the process, ocurring typically 
in old age, by which bones become thin and brittle 
through lack of calcium. The bone formations tending more than others to be 
affected by osteoporosis are those characterized by 
a "cantilever", such as the femur-pelvis structure. 
More exactly, the proximal extremity of the femur, 
comprising the ball, the neck and the topmost part 
of the diaphysis, is required to support the weight  
 
of the body, which, bearing down on the ball of the 
femur, is transmitted to the diaphysis through the 
lever arm afforded by the narrow neck of the bone. 
The group of elements in question broadly resembles 
an upturned 'L' (discernible in fig 1) on which the 
weight of the body impinges directly from above, in 
such a manner that the resulting vertical force FV 
is applied to the projecting end of the horizontal 
member of the upturned 'L'; accordingly, this same 
projecting member (the ball TF) tends to bend, or 
if stressed beyond a certain limit, to fracture at 
the junction with the vertical member of the 'L' 
(at the base B of the neck CF). Required as it is to withstand the dynamic stresses 
generated daily in ambulation, the physiological 
composition of the femur presents a structure of 
osseous lamellae arranged in bundles and disposed 
along lines coinciding with the mechanical forces 
to be accommodated: a first pair of such bundles 
(denominated principal and secondary traction) 
extending from the proximal lateral extremity of 
the diaphysis substantially up to the extremities 
of the ball and neck, and a second pair of bundles 
(denominated principal and secondary compression) 
extending from the proximal medial extremity of the  
 
diaphysis to the uppermost part of the ball and the 
neck. Osteoporosis is essentially the process by which 
the ends of the osseous lamellar structures become 
thinner to the point ultimately of exposing an area 
less able to withstand the load normally applied; 
the area in question, known as Ward's

A device for preventive support of the femur, in 
particular the extremity of a femoral bone (1) 

consisting in a ball (2) associated with a neck 
portion (3) extending along a first axis (X1) 

disposed at an angle (Î±) relative to a rectilinear 
second axis (X2) substantially coinciding with that 

of the femoral diaphysis (4) to which the neck 
portion is attached, 

characterized, 
in that it comprises: 


a tubular element (5) fashioned in biocompatible 
material, stably insertable into a blind socket (6) 

created in the femoral bone (1) parallel with and 
in the region of the first axis (X1); 
first and second locking means (7, 8) fashioned in 
biocompatible material, operating unidirectionally 

and in mutual opposition, and designed to determine 
a partial variation in the external shape of the 

tubular element (5) such as will allow of securing 
the tubular element stably against the bone surface 

of the socket (6) and establishing a load-bearing 
 

axis (A) that bridges the first axis (X1) and the 
second axis (X2). 
A device as in claim 1, wherein the first locking 
means (7) consist in a tapered expansion pin (9), 

insertable coaxially and helically into the tubular 
element (5) to assume a position interposed between 

one end (5b) of the tubular element and the second 
locking means (8), of which the position internally 

of the tubular element (5) is determined by screw 
means (10) occupying the remaining end (5a) of the 

tubular element, rigidly associated with a cap (11) 
serving to block the corresponding end (5a) of the 

tubular element and disposed facing the inserted 
end (9a) of the tapered pin (9), which affords a 

threaded hole (12) for coupling to the screw means. 
A device as in claim 2, wherein the wall of the 
tubular element (5) is embodied with a plurality of 

longitudinal cuts (13), uniformly distributed in 
the angular direction, such that the effect of 

screwing the tapered pin (9) toward the cap (11) is 
to induce a deformation whereby at least one end 

portion of the tubular element (5) is restrained 
axially in relation to the socket (6). 
A device as in claim 2, wherein the end of the 
tapered pin (9) remote from the end (9a) affording 

the threaded hole (12) is embodied with a travel 
limiting shoulder (14) designed to abut with the 

corresponding end (5b) of the tubular element (5). 
A device as in claim 2, wherein the second locking 
means (8) comprise a set of deformable prongs (15) 

permanently anchored at one end to a ring (16) 
inserted into the tubular element (5) and affording 

a central hole (17) to admit the screw means (10), 
also a circular expansion cone (19), interposed 

between the ring (16) and the tapered pin (9) and 
affording a central threaded hole (20), by which 

the prongs (15) are spread apart forcibly one from 
another and caused to project through and beyond 

respective slots (18) afforded by the wall of the 
tubular element (5). 
A device as in claim 5, wherein the prongs (15) are 
at least three in number and distributed uniformly 

around the axis of the tubular element (5), each 
affording a sharp edge (21) at the end remote from 

the end anchored to the ring (16).
