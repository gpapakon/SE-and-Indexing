<ABSTRACT>
A flexible line trimmer (100) for shipping and storing in a 
knocked down version for reduced package sizes includes a 

single length of tube (114) that is received within an extended 
neck portion (112) of a motor housing. During final assembly,

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to assembling flexible line 
trimmers shipped in a disassembled state. An electrically powered trimmer includes a cutting 
element mounted to the drive shaft of an electric motor, a 
housing in which the motor is mounted and that is attached 
to one end of a tube, and a pair of handles at the opposite 
end of the tube. The cutting element is most often a 
length of flexible line, though it could also be a blade. 
The length of line extends from a line head connected to 
the shaft of the motor. The head is spun rapidly to flail 
the line against vegetation. Because the line frequently 
breaks, a supply of flexible line is stored on a spool in 
the head, the end of the line extending through an opening 
in the head. An operator holds the trimmer while standing erect by 
grasping with one hand a main handle attached to the end 
the tube that extends upwardly and rearwardly from the 
housing. Depending on the size of the trimmer, the other 
hand may grasp an auxiliary handle that can be attached 
lower down on the tube between the main handle and the 
housing to provide enhanced control. A trigger located,  
 
usually, on the main handle operates a normally off switch 
that turns the motor on and off. Usually, power is delivered to the motor by a 120 volt 
alternating current from a household outlet. A plug or 
"pigtail" for connection to an extension cord running from 
the outlet is typically located in the rear of the handle, 
but is sometimes located elsewhere on the trimmer. The 
power source alternately is a battery pack placed in the 
vicinity of the main handle for balance. With either power 
source, a power wire runs to the electric motor in the 
housing through the tube to the normally-off trigger switch 
on the rear handle. To save space, electric, flexible line trimmers are 
sometimes packaged and shipped in a "knocked down" or 
partially disassembled state. The benefits of packing 
trimmers disassembled are well known and it has been done 
for many years. Traditionally, to knock down the trimmer, 
the tube that supports the handles is manufactured in two 
or more sections that are separated and folded over when 
placed in a box. In other cases, the tube may be 
manufactured as a single piece but not attached to the 
motor housing, the main handle or both to save space. For safety, the trimmer must be "prewired," as the 
wire through the tube carries relatively high voltage (120 
volt) alternating current. The wire is run through the 
tube and attached to the electric motor

<CLAIMS>
An electric line trimmer adapted for shipping in 
a partially disassembled state to reduce package size and 

for easy final assembly by an untrained person without 
problems typically associated with a two piece handle 

support, the trimmer comprising: 
   an electric motor coupled to a vegetation cutter that 

is adapted to be held near to the ground for cutting 
vegetation; 

   an elongated handle support tube, the tube having a 
length and adapted at one end to receive a main handle; 

   a main handle including a switch for controlling a 
supply of power to the electric motor through a wire 

extending from the main handle, through the tube and to the 
electric motor; the main handle positioned to permit an 

operator to hold the cutter near the ground while standing; 
and 

   a housing in which the motor is mounted, the housing 
having a portion in which the motor is mounted and an 

elongated neck portion that is adapted to receive a 
substantial portion of the length the elongated tube in a 

collapsed position in order to reduce an overall height of 
the trimmer for placement in a smaller package for shipment 

and storage; the neck being further adapted for enabling 
the elongated tube to be withdrawn in a linear fashion by 

a person and placed in an extended operating position, the 
neck of the housing and the handle support tube cooperating 

 
in the extended operating position to enable positioning of 

the cutter in an operating position as an operator stands. 
The trimmer of Claim 1 further comprising an 
elongated guide along an inside portion of the neck of the 

housing and an engaging member on the tube cooperating with 
the guide to assist in maintaining a predetermined 

orientation of the tube with respect to housing. 
The trimmer of Claim 2 wherein the engaging 
cooperating member includes a detent button and wherein the 

guide includes a ramp for depressing the detent button 
during extension of the tube from the neck of the housing 

and then releasing the button for discrete positioning of 
the tube and positive feedback to a customer extending the 

tube. 
The trimmer of Claim 3 wherein the ramp 
terminates abruptly when the tube extends to an operating 

position, the ramp having an end for forming wall that 
prevents the detent button from being depressed when the 

tube is moved toward the collapsed position, thus 
substantially preventing collapsing of the tube by pushing 

on the tube. 
The trimmer of Claim 3 further including a 
plurality of ramps for providing multiple positions of the 

tube for operation. 
The trimmer of Claim 2 further comprising a 
second guide formed along the inside wall of the neck of 

the housing in a direction generally perpendicular to the 
first guide, the second guide cooperating with the engaging 

member to allow limited rotation of the housing with 
respect to the tube for positioning a cutting plane of the 

vegetation cutter between orientations generally 
perpendicular to the ground and generally parallel to the 

ground when the trimmer is held in a normal operating 
position. 
The trimmer of Claim 1 wherein an extra length of 
the wire is pinned within the neck of the housing to take 

up slack while accommodating extension of the tube without 
the wire becoming tangled. 
The trimmer of Claim 1 wherein the neck of the 
housing includes a clamp that is manually operable without 

tools to tighten the neck about the tube once fully 
extended into an operating position. 
The apparatus of any of the foregoing claims 
wherein the means for guiding withdrawal further including 

means for indicating to a person that the tube has been 
placed in a proper operating position. 
A method of packing an electric trimmer in a box 
in a knocked-down manner to reduce size of the package and 

to enable easy final assembly by a customer; the electric 
trimmer including an electric motor mounted in a housing 

and coupled to a vegetation cutter that is adapted to be 
held near to the ground for cutting vegetation, an 

elongated tube for supporting handles, the tube having a 
length and adapted at one end to receive a main handle; a 

main handle including a switch for controlling a supply of 
power to the electric motor through a wire extending from 

the main handle, through the tube and to the electric 
motor, the main handle being positioned to permit an 

operator to hold the cutter near the ground while standing; 
the method comprising t
he steps of: 
   prewiring the electric trimmer by connecting a wire 

from the switch in the main handle, through the tube and to 
the housing for controlling power to the electric motor; 

   placing the tube inside an elongated neck portion of 
the housing that is adapted to receive a substantial 

portion of the length of the elongated tube in a collapsed 
position in order to reduce an overall height of the 

 
trimmer; the neck being further adapted for enabling the 

elongated tube to be withdrawn in a linear fashion by a 
person and placed in an extended operating position, the 

neck of the housing and the handle support tube cooperating 
in the extended operating position to enable positioning of 

the cutter in an operating position as an operator stands; 
and 

   packing the trimmer in a box with the tube in the 
collapsed position for shipment. 
The method of Claim 10 further comprising the 
step of pinning a loop of the wire running between the main 

handle and the housing within the housing in a manner to 
allow extension of the tube without interference from the 

wire. 
The method of Claim 11 wherein the main handle is 
attached to the tube prior to packing.
