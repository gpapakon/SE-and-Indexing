<ABSTRACT>
A fluid storage tank (38) comprising a main body (12) and covers (14) to close off openings of the main body (12). The main body (12) and covers (14) have inside surfaces (15a, 15b) which are, in use, in contact with fluid stored in the tank (38). The main body (12) is made up of a casing (16) and a liner (18) which is provided inside the casing (16). The covers (14) are releasably retained in place and seal with the inside surface (15a) of the main body (12) so that fluid can be stored in the tank (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid storage tank. The fluid storage tank is used to store fluid which is 
under pressure, as for example document FR-A-2 574 166. The fluid storage tank of the present invention may be 
used as the hot water storage tank in a hot water 
system. The hot water system may, for example, be a 
solar, gas or electric hot water system. The fluid 
storage tank of the present invention may be used in 
other applications in which fluid is stored under 
pressure in a tank or similar container, eg water 
filters, fire extinguishes, and gas cylinders. Fluid storage tanks used to store fluid under pressure 
may deteriorate over time. In fluid storage tanks used in hot water systems, 
deterioration generally occurs to the lining inside such 
tanks which is in contact with the fluid stored in the 
tank. However, due to the structure of conventional 
tanks when this deterioration occurs to the lining, the 
entire tank must be replaced. In contrast the present invention provides a fluid 
storage tank in which only the liner needs to be 
replaced if it deteriorates. In this way the fluid 
storage tank of the present invention is recyclable or 
renewable. The present invention provides a fluid storage tank  
 
which may also be used in other applications in which fluid is 
stored under pressure to provide a fluid storage tank which is 
recyclable or renewable. According to the present invention there is provided a fluid 
storage tank comprising a main body 
having casing means, liner means and at least one opening, with 
said liner means provided inside said casing means and defining 
an inside surface of said main body; 
cover means to close off said main body to enable fluid to be 
stored in said fluid storage tank, said cover means having an 
inside surface and an outside surface, said liner means and said 
inside surface of said cover means arranged to be, in use, in 
contact with fluid stored in said fluid storage tank; characterized by seal means provided at a location substantially at said outside 
surface of said cover means; and in that said cover means is releasably and non-connectedly 
retained with said main body and said seal means seals with said 
liner means inside said main body such that fluid is storable in 
said fluid storage tank and said seal means seals with said liner 
means in a pressure induced sealing contact whereby increase in 
pressure of said fluid in said fluid storage tank provides 
increased sealing contact of said seal means with said liner 
means; and
