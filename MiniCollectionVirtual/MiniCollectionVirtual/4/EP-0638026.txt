<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to seats, 
and, more specifically, to power seat adjusters for automobile 
seats. Powered seat adjusters are a popular option on many 
automotive vehicles and are frequently offered as standard 
equipment on higher priced vehicles. Such power seat adjusters 
are primarily used on the driver's seat and, sometimes, on the 
front passenger seat of the vehicle. Such power seat adjusters carry an upper support frame 
which supports the seat bottom and sometimes the seat back of the 
vehicle seat. The upper support frame is mounted on first and 
second, spaced track assemblies, each formed of an upper track 
which is connected to the upper support frame and which is 
slidably mounted in a lower track anchored to the vehicle floor. 
A drive mechanism, typically formed of a bi-directional electric 
motor mounted on the power seat adjuster which rotates a pair of 
drive shafts extending outward from the motor to a gear assembly 
or box mounted in each upper track. In one arrangement, the gear 
box rotates a lead screw extending below each upper track. A 
drive block mounted to the lower track threadingly receives the 
lead screw to cause reciprocal movement of the upper track and 
the attached upper support frame upon selective energization of 
the drive motor. Other drive mechanisms may also be incorporated 
into the power seat adjuster to provide vertical movement of the 
seat frame as well as pivotal movement of the seat back with 
respect to the seat bottom. Although such power seat adjusters provide easy fore 
and aft movement of the seat in the lower tracks, it is 
imperative that the seat remain in a fixed, stationary position 
during a collision in order to prevent injury to the vehicle  
 
passenger using the seat. As a result, the weight and size of 
the power seat adjuster components are selected to provide a 
maximum amount of strength to resist any movement under the high 
impact forces transmitted to the seat from occupant and seat 
weight inertial loads and, sometimes, through the seat belt 
during a vehicle collision. Thus, the individual tracks, the 
torsion tubes or bars typically extending between and 
interconnecting the spaced upper tracks into a rigid structure 
and the other components of the power seat adjuster are made with 
stronger materials and greater thicknesses and dimensions to 
provide the requisite amount of strength. Although this adds 
weight and cost to the seat, such efforts have been considered 
essential to provide adequate

<CLAIMS>
A power seat adjuster (10) for a vehicle, the power seat 
adjuster (10) having first and second spaced track 

assemblies (46, 48), each formed of a lower track (50) 
and an upper track (52) slidably disposed within each 

lower track (50), a drive motor (22, 24, 26, 34) having 
first and second rotatable output shafts (40), each extending 

toward one of the first and second track assemblies (46, 
48), a lead screw (144) disposed between one upper and 

one lower track (50), a drive block (160) fixedly mounted 
to the one lower track (50) and threadingly engaging the 

lead screw (144), and gear means (140) fixedly mounted to 
the one upper track (52) and coupling the one motor 

output shaft (40) to the one lead screw (144), the power 
seat adjuster (10)comprising: 


the gear means including a plurality of meshingly engaged 
gears, at least certain of which gears are formed of a 

plastic material; and 
means (170), force transmittingly coupled at a first end 
portion to the one upper track (52) and disposed at a 

second end portion about the lead screw (144) associated 
therewith and normally decouplingly spaced from the gear 

means (140), for transmitting forces imparted on the 
upper track (52) and tending to move the upper track (52) 

in a forward direction between the one upper track (52) 
and the lead screw (144) bypassingly around the gear 

means (140). 
The power seat adjuster (10) of claim 1 wherein the gear 
means (140) comprises: 


a housing (142) attached to the upper track (52); 
a first gear (148) rotatably mounted in the housing (142) 
and connected to one of the first and second motor output 

shafts (40); and 
a second gear (152) fixedly mounted on one end of the 
lead screw (144) and disposed within the housing (142) in 

meshing engagement with the first gear (148), the first  
 

and second gears (148,152) transmitting rotation of the 
one of the first and second motor output shafts (40) to 

rotation of the associated lead screw (144). 
The power seat adjuster (10) of claim 2 further 
comprising:
 
a metallic disc (154) mounted on one end of the lead 

screw (144), the second gear (152) being inert molded 
about the metallic disc and the lead screw (144). 
The power seat adjuster (10) of claim 2 or 3 wherein the 
housing (142) and the first and second gears (148,152) 

are formed of a plastic material. 
The power seat adjuster (10) of one of the claims 2 to 4 
wherein the first gear (148) is a worm and the second 

gear (152) is a worm gear. 
The power seat adjuster (10) of one of the preceding 
claims wherein force transmission means are mounted on 

each of the first and second track assemblies (46, 48). 
The power seat adjuster (10) of one of the preceding 
claims wherein the force transmitting means comprises: 

a one-piece strap (170) having first and second end 
portions (172,174;182), the first end portion (172, 174) 

disposed about the lead screw (144), the second end 
portion (182) coupled in a force transmitting path with 

the one upper track (52); and an intermediate portion 
(184) of the strap (170) between the first and second end 

portions (182) bypassingly disposed around the gear means 
(140) and formed to have a predetermined, predictable 

elongation-force characteristic.

contour of the intermediate portion (184) of the strap 
(170) between the first and second end portions (182) is

tension toward a substantially planar shape. 
The power seat adjuster (10) of claim 7 or 8 wherein the 
strap (170) is metallic.
