<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgical instrument
for installation of a surgical implant in a living
tissue, particularly in connection with a surgical
operation. The installation instrument comprises a
frame with an installation channel, in which the
implant is inserted in the beginning of installation.
The instrument comprises further an installation part
arranged to be inserted in the said installation
channel and to convey to the implant an external force needed for
the installation of the implant, the
frame being placed in connection with the tissue in a
manner that the implant is inserted in the said tissue
when it exits the said installation channel at the
installation end of the frame.In this context, living tissue refers particularly to
bone, ligament, connective tissue, synovial or joint
tissue, muscular tissue, etc. Further, it can be
stated that the important fields of applying the
invention include corrective surgery of meniscal
rupture as well as bone surgery as treatment of bone
fractures. The installation instrument of the invention
is suitable for use in arthroscopic surgery. In this
invention, implant refers to a usually elongated
macroscopic piece which is suitable to be surgically
installed with a force effective thereon which moves
the implant essentially in the direction of its largest
dimension into the tissue. Implants of this kind
typically include rod-shaped and arrow-shaped implants.
As to arrow-shaped implants, reference is made in this
context to the publication US-4,873,976 which discloses
an arrow-shaped implant and a method for its installation
to be used particularly in the repairing surgery
of meniscal rupture. The implant is typically manufactured 
of at least partially bioabsorbable polymer
material.In surgery, it is generally known to use installation
instruments, typically manufactured of metal, for
installing macroscopic implants, such as rods, hooks,
pins, bolts and the like, in living tissues to connect
operated or damaged tissues with each other or with
other tissues. In such surgical installation instruments,
the implant is typically placed at the initial
stage either in part or wholly inside an installation
channel in the installation instrument and forced
from the installation instrument into the tissue by
tapping manually with a hammer a special, typically
piston-like installation part which conveys the force
generated with the hammer to the implant and thus
forces the implant to penetrate into the tissue. It
is also known to use an application whereby
