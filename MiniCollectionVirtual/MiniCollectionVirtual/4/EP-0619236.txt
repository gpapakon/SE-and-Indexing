<ABSTRACT>
Carton with delivery device of loose products 
comprising: a container (2); a delivery device (4) of 

loose products with an opening (8) made on one of the 
narrow lateral sides (6) of the container (2), 

containing an area (10) facilitating raising of the 
tongue positioned on the inferior part of the opening, 

within which the container has a depression, a closing 
lap (14) of the opening with an upper edge (16) integral 

with the container (2), lateral edges (18) separable 
from the container and a lower edge (20) positioned on 

the area of insertion through which the lap is moveable 
from a lower position where the lap closes the delivery 

opening and an upper position where the opening is open.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a carton with a delivery device 
of loose products comprising: a container made with a 
die-cut cardboard blank; and a delivery device of loose 
products with an opening made on one of the faces of the 
containers. Presently, the containers are widespread in 
a parallelapiped form which are obtained by folding a 
die-cut cardboard blank in a certain manner. Said containers are usually filled with loose 
products which are, mainly, in granular or powder form. 
These can be food products such as rice, flour, salt or, 
perhaps, powdered detergents. On one of the sides of 
the parallelepiped of the container there is a delivery 
device which serves to release the correct amount of the 
loose product. Said delivery devices are essentially 
comprised of a closing lap or little door of generally 
rectangular shape which covers an opening. The lap has 
one of the two vertical sides connected to the container 
while the two horizontal sides are connected to the 
container but separable from this through suitable lines 
of perforation. The second vertical side is, instead, 
free in such a way that the user grasping it, is in a 
position to detach the two horizontal sides along the 
lines of perforation. In this way, rotating the lap 
around the first vertical side, it is possible to open 
and close the opening. In addition, the free side is 
equipped with a tongue which allows to close the  
 
container again after use, inserting the tongue in the 
opening. This type of delivery device has some 
disadvantages. First of all, after having closed the lap again, 
inserting the tongue in the opening, it opens again with 
ease. This occurs, for example, if the box is held, as 
it often is, pressing the upper surface of the 
parallelepiped with the hand. In this way, one causes 
the inward deformation of the walls of the container and 
the consequent deformation of the contour which defines 
the opening, with the consequent exit of the tongue from 
the opening whereby the lap is no longer maintained in 
a closed position. There is also another serious inconvenience which 
occurs with the opening of a container which has never 
been opened in the past. In this case, the user finds 
difficulty in attempting to raise the free side to be 
able to open the lap, pulling it along the lines of 
perforation. This difficulty is due to the fact that 
the free side of the lap is flush with the surface 
adjacent to the wall of the container on which this is 
found. Thus, numerous attempts are made before the user

Carton with delivery device of loose products 
comprising: a container (2) made from a die-cut 

cardboard blank; a delivery device (4) of loose products 
with a delivery opening (8) defined in one of the narrow 

lateral walls (6) of the container (2) and comprising a 
closing lap (14) of the opening with an upper end (16) 

connected to the container (2) and lateral edges (18) 
separable from said container (2) along proper lines of 

perforation, characterized in that the device (4) has an 
area (10) facilitating raising of the tongue positioned 

on the lower part of the delivery opening (8), within 
said area (10) said container (2) has a depression in 

its thickness and comprising a lower edge (20) of said 
closing lap positioned on the area (10) facilitating 

raising of the tongue at a reduced thickness so that 
said closing lap (14) is moveable through laceration of 

the lines of perforation from a lower position, which 
closes the delivery opening, to an upper position, when 

the opening is open. 
Carton according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the narrow lateral wall (6) where there is the 

delivery opening (8) has a greater thickness with 
respect to the other walls of the container (2), 
Carton according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said area (10) of depression is attained 

superimposing the two flaps which make up the ends of 
the strip of the die-cut cardboard in such a way that 

 
the flap found on the outside creates a wider window 

relative to a smaller window which defines the delivery 
opening (8) on the internal flap whereby the internal or 

lower flap remains exposed at said depression area (10). 
Carton according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it has a closing slot (12) positioned in the area 

(10) facilitating raising of the tongue, a tongue (22) 
provided on the lower edge (20), being insertable in the 

slot (12).
