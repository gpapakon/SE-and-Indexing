<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of waferboard. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to the manufacture of waferboard 
using phenol formaldehyde resin as the binding resin in a steam pressing 
operation. The term "waferboard" as used throughout this disclosure is intended to 
include conventional waferboard, oriented strand board, oriented long wafer 
products, particleboard, fibreboard, flakeboard, parallel strand lumber 
products, composite lumber or the like. It is common practice in conventional heated platen pressing (no 
steam applied directly to the layup) of waferboard to use either a liquid or 
a powdered phenolic resin adhesive as the binder as each are quite 
satisfactory for the purpose. The combination of both a liquid and a powder 
applied in sequence as the adhesive has also been used in conventionally 
heated platen pressing of waferboard. US-A-3,968,308 issued on July 6, 1976 to Buschfeld et al describes 
a process of applying powdered adhesive through a liquid spray in order to 
adhere the powdered adhesive to the chips. This patent discusses the prior 
art attempts to solve the problem by moistening the chips prior to binder 
addition by spraying water on the chips or using chips with high residual 
moisture particularly in the centre layers or simultaneously moistening an 
application of powder resin. The concept of steam pressing to consolidate particleboard is well 
known and is used commercially. The use of phenol formaldehyde resin for 
bonding steam pressed particle board is described in an article entitled Steam 
Press Process for Curing Phenolic-Bonded Particleboard, Forest Products 
Journal, Volume 23, No. 3, March 1973 by Shen. In this article a description 
is given of a process of consolidating hardwood particles using a liquid phenol 
formaldehyde resin and the application of this technique to produce boards  
 
having significantly better dimensional stability. Similar studies were carried 
out by Geimer (Steam Injection Pressing, proceedings of the 16th 
Washington State University International Symposium on Particleboard, 1982, 
March 30 and April 1, Pullman, Washington, Geimer et al (see Thick 
Composite are Technically Feasible with Steam-Injection Pressing' presented 
at Composite Board Product for Furniture and Cabinets: Inventions in 
Manufacture and Utilization, Greensboro, N.C., November 11-13, 1986 and

Hardwoods in Proceedings of the 20th International
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process of producing, from particulate lignocellulosic material, a consolidated 
product having an average internal bond strength of at least 0,586 MPa (85 psi), comprising drying 

said material, applying liquid phenol formaldehyde resin having a resin solids content of 
at least 35% by weight on the surface of said material, applying a dry phenol 

formaldehyde resin to said material, then forming a layup from said material having said 
resins applied thereto, coordinating said drying and said application of liquid resin to 

ensure said layup has a moisture content of no more than 7% based on the oven dry 
weight of the material and steam pressing said layup at elevated temperature and 

pressure sufficient to set or cure said resins and consolidate said layup into said product. 
A process as defined in claim 1 wherein said dry phenol formaldehyde resin is 
applied to said material after application of said liquid resin. 
A process as defined in claim 2 wherein said liquid resin has a solids content of 
at least 45% by weight. 
A process as defined in claim 2 or claim 3 wherein said resin solids content of said liquid 
phenol formaldehyde resin will comprise 25 to 75% by weight of the total resin applied 

to said material. 
A process as defined in any one of claims 2 - 4 wherein said liquid resin comprises a phenol 
formaldehyde resole resin. 
A process as defined in any one of claims 2 - 5 wherein said moisture content is no greater than 
about 6% based on the oven dry weight of the material.  

 
A process as defined in any one of claims 2 - 6 wherein said moisture content is no greater than 
5% based on the oven dry weight of the material. 
A process as defined in any preceding claim wherein dry resin is applied to the lignocellulosic 
material after said material has been sufficiently tackified to cause the dry resin to 

adhere, followed by the application of said liquid resin. 
A process as defined in claim 1 wherein the dry resin and liquid resin are applied 
simultaneously to the lignocellulosic material.  

 
A process as defined in claim 8 wherein the lignocellulosic material has been 
tackified by the application to it of a wax.
