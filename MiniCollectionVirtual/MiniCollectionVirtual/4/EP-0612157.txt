<ABSTRACT>
A remote control method for an audio/visual system 
which can perform protection during execution of a system 

feature and is convenient in use is disclosed. The remote 
control method is applied to an audio/visual system wherein 

each of a plurality of audio/visual equipments includes a 
microcomputer for controlling operation of the audio/visual 

equipment. The microcomputers of the audio/visual 
equipments are connected to each other by way of a bus 

system. One of the audio/visual equipments is set as an 
audio/visual center equipment. The audio/visual center 

equipment controls the entire system in a concentrated 
manner. The audio/visual center equipment receives remote 

control signals in a concentrated manner without causing 
remote controller receiver sections of the audio/visual 

equipments other than the audio/visual center equipment to 
function and transfers necessary commands to the 

audio/visual equipments.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a remote control method for an
audio/visual system wherein a plurality of audio/visual
equipments are connected to each other by way of a domestic
digital bus system such as, for example, a D2B bus system.Audio/visual systems wherein a plurality of
audio/visual equipments are connected to each other by way
of a bus system to make up a set are conventionally known.
In an audio/visual system of the type mentioned, a center
equipment is set in advance, and one concentrated remote
control signal transmission means called system remote
controller is provided for a system 
feature which is executed by cooperation of a plurality
of equipments. A command from the system remote control
signal transmission means is received by the center
equipment and the system feature is started, and then,
execution of the system feature is controlled by the
center equipment. Then, the command or a corresponding
command is transferred to the audio/visual equipments.An exemplary one of conventional audio/visual
systems of the type mentioned is shown in FIG. 5.
Referring to FIG. 5, the audio/visual system includes a
television receiver 1, a video tape recorder 2, an
audio/visual amplifier 3, and a multi-disk player 4
which can reproduce optical disks such as a CD (compact
disk) and an LD (laser disk). In the audio/visual
system shown, the television receiver 1 serves as a
center equipment.For transmission and reception of an audio
signal and a video signal, the television receiver 1 and
the audio/visual amplifier 3 are connected to each other
by way of an audio/visual signal line L1, and the
audio/visual amplifier 3 and the video tape recorder 2,
and the audio/visual amplifier 3 and the multi-disk
player 4 are connected to each other by way of
audio/visual signal lines L2 and L3, respectively. Further, each of the audio/visual equipments 1
to 4 includes a control circuit in which a single or a
plurality of microcomputers for controlling operation of
the equipment are employed, and the control circuits of
the audio/visual equipments 1 to 4 are connected in
cascade connection by way of bidirectional buses B1, B2
and B3 for transmission of a control signal into a
single system.The audio/visual equipments 1 to 4 include
remote controller receiver sections R1, r2, r3 and r4,
respectively, and a remote control signal (command)
received by each of them is inputted to and processed by
a control circuit of the audio/visual equipment. In the
audio/visual system shown, the remote controller
receiver section R1 of
