<ABSTRACT>
A pretreating apparatus suitable for the adhesion of plastic sheets 
having poor adhesive properties comprises a primer treatment means and 

an adhesive application means. The present invention is characterized by 
the primer treatment means (20). The primer treatment means includes a 

sheet conveyance means for conveying the plastic sheet in one direction 
at a constant speed, a friction means (21) having a friction member made 

of a flexible porous member and arranged so as to come into contact with 
the adhesive areas to be primer-treated of the plastic sheets, a press 

means (22) disposed confronting said friction member and for pressing 
the plastic sheet against said friction member, and a primer solution 

supply means for the supply of the primer solution to said friction 
member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pretreating apparatus
used in the adhesion of plastic sheets, more particularly for
primer
treatment and preferably also an adhesive application treatment onto areas
of plastic sheet.Plastic sheets, in particular, transparent or translucent
rigid plastic sheets have been often used in the form of
packages or cases for accommodating foods or a variety of
groceries and packing them. The process of manufacturing the
packages or cases generally comprises the step of previously
applying adhesive onto adhesive joints of plastic sheets cut in
accordance with a predetermined development, introducing the
plastic sheets into an adhesive bonding apparatus to fold them,
and pressurizing or heating under pressure the adhesive joints
for the adhesion.Some plastic sheets have good adhesive properties and
others poor ones. For example, polyvinyl chloride
plastic sheets are satisfactory in adhesive properties, whereas
sheets made of polyolefin plastic such as polyethylene or
polypropylene plastic are extremely poor. It is difficult to
directly bond such plastic sheets having poor adhesive
properties, and hence their adhesive joints must be subjected 
to a primer treatment for surface roughening preparatory to the
application of the adhesive in a pretreating apparatus.For use in such primer treatment, available
primer solutions include for example Aron primer (pretreatment agent
for aron alpha which is an instantaneous adhesive) from
Toagosei Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. and Cyano primer from
Koatsu Gas Kogyo Co., Ltd. Paper or cloth impregnated with
such primer solution is used to wipe the adhesive joints to
roughen them.This conventional manner of pretreating before adhesion
is, however, inefficient and poor in reliability.
Particularly, the primer treatment involves the following
critical problems.
(i) The treatment with the primer solution is often
non-uniform, which inevitably leads to unevenness of surface
roughening.(ii) In an extreme case, a portion may remain
unroughened.(iii) Primer solution may be squeezed out of
the adhesive joints, which noticeably impairs the outward
appearance when assembled into packages or cases, and lowers the
product value.(iv) The treatment is slow.(v) Automation of the subsequent adhesive bonding
step is difficult because of the unreliability of the
treatment and the slow treatment speed.FR-A-2022379 / GB-A-1288041 describes a device for
applying coating material in a liquid state to a receptor
surface. The coating material may be a lacquer, key-coat
