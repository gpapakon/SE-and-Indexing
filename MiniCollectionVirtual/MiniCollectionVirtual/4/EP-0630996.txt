<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes and apparatus for the production of polymer fibers and filaments.The production of polymer fibers and filaments usually involves the use of a mix of a single polymer with nominal amounts of stabilizers and pigments. The mix is melt extruded into fibers and fibrous products using conventional commercial processes. Non-woven fabrics are typically made by making a web of the fibers, and then thermally bonding the fibers together where they meet. More specifically, staple fibers are converted into non-woven fabrics using, for example, a carding machine, and the carded fabric is thermally bonded. The thermal bonding can be achieved using various heating techniques, including heating with heated rollers and heating through the use of ultrasonic welding.Conventional thermally bonded non-woven fabrics exhibit good loft and softness properties, but less than optimal cross-directional strength, and less than optimal cross-directional strength in combination with high elongation. The strength of the thermally bonded non-woven fabrics depends upon the orientation of the fibers and the inherent strength of the bond points.Over the years, improvements have been made in fibers which provide stronger bond strengths. However, further improvements are needed to provide even higher fabric strengths to permit use of these fabrics in today's high speed converting processes for hygiene products, such as diapers and other types of incontinence products. In particular, there is a need for a thermally bondable fiber and a resulting nonwoven fabric that possess high cross-directional strength and high elongation.Further, there is a need to produce thermally bondable fibers that can achieve superior cross-directonal strength, elongation and toughness properties in combination with fabric uniformity and loftiness. In particular, there is a need to obtain fibers that can produce carded, calendared fabrics with cross-directional properties on the order of at least 650 g/in, (12.5 N/5 cm) with an elongation of 140-180%, and a toughness of 480-700 g/in (9 -13.5 N/5 cm) for a 20 g/yd2 (24 g/m2) fabric bonded at speeds as high as 500 ft/min (152 m/min) or more.A number of patent applications have been filed by the present assignee which are directed to improvements in polymer degradation, spin and quench steps, and extrusion compositions that enable the production of fibers having an improved ability to thermally bond accompanied by the ability to produce non-woven fabric having increased
