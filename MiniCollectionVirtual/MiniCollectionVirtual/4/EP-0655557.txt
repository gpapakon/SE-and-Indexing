<ABSTRACT>
A device for the delivery of fluids is proposed by means of which the fluid can be delivered from a first level to a second, higher level. The device (100) comprises a housing (10) provided with an inlet passage (25) and an outlet passage (27) as well as a pressure chamber (26). An impact body (35) acted upon by the fed fluid as well as a valve member (30) which interacts with the impact body (35) and can be brought into sealing engagement with the outlet passage (27) are arranged in the housing (10). The pressure chamber (26) is connected to a valve chamber (18) arranged in the housing (10) via a valve device (20) designed essentially as a non-return valve, the valve chamber (18) being connected to a pressure reservoir (5) into which the fluid flows, when valve device (20) is open, until a pressure balance occurs between the pressure chamber (26) and the pressure reservoir (5) and the valve device (20) is closed.

Device for conveying a liquid medium, notably in the form of a column of liquid,
consisting of a housing (10; 110) incorpor
ating an inlet passage (25; 125), an outlet
passage (27; 127), a pressure chamber (26; 126) and equalising chamber (18, 118),

with a first valve body (30; 130) arranged inside the pressure chamber and an impact
body (35; 135) connected to and operating with this first valve body but situated

outside the pressure chamber, in which the first valve body and the impact body are
acted upon by the liquid in such a way that the first valve body, by means of

movement in an axial direction, can be brought into contact with the outlet passage to
form a seal and thereby produce a pressure shock in the pressure chamber, as a result

of which a second valve body which releases the fluid flow to the equalising chamber
is held in the open position until pressure equalisation is achieved between the

equalising chamber connected to the pressure vessel, and the pressure chamber; and

characterised by the fact
 that the pressure chamber (26; 126) and the associated
equalising chamber (18; 118) are connected to each other by a series of openings (21;

121; 171; 181; 191) around the circumference, spaced axially at a distance from each
other, and also by the fact that a valve group (45; 120; 170;180; 190) with second

valve bodies (23; 123; 173; 183; 193) is arranged in the equalising chamber (18; 118)
to close and thus seal off the individual openings and to re-open them, which can be

lifted relative to the openings (21; 121; 171; 181; 191) as a function of the pressure
shock against either their own spring restoring force or that of an associated spring

element.

230; 330; 430; 530) arranged in the pressure chamber (26; 126) operates in

conjunction with a deflector body (40; 140), in relation to which it can move in an
axial direction, guided concentrically with it by a guide element (32; 102; 103), and

that this deflector body (40; 140) is conical in shape, widening in the direction of
flow, and the first valve body (30; 130; 203; 330; 430; 530) is conical in shape,

tapering in the direction of flow, and the associated outlet passage (27; 127) is
similarly shaped as a conical taper to form a seal when brought into contact with the

first valve body.
Device as in Claim 1,

512) positioned axially at a distance from the connection flange (160), and an end

flange (155) positioned axially at a distance from the intermediate flange, these

(107; 107') distributed around the circumference, and in such a way that they are
adjustable in an axial direction relative to each other.
Device as in Claim 3, 
characterised by the fact

(117), which may constitute the pressure chamber (126), is arranged between the

connection flange (160) attached to the housing part (111) and the intermediate flange
(112; 212; 312; 412; 512) maintained at a distance from it, and is shaped to

accommodate the valve group (120; 170; 180; 190), which incorporates the second
valve bodies, all the way round its circumference.
Device as in Claim 3, 
characterised by the fact

arranged in the connection flange (160), and is subdivided into individual openings

(163) by centrally-located hub (164) and a number of ribs (166) distributed around its
circumference, the outer face (163') of the hub (164) being essentially similar in shape

to the deflector body (140), which widens in the direction of flow and is fastened to
the hub (164).
Device as in Claims 2 and 3, 
characterised by the fact
 that the first valve body (130)
possesses a stepped external part (133), which can be brought into contact with a

similarly-stepped inner part (317) of the intermediate flange (312) in order to form a
seal.
Device as in Claims 2 and 3,
