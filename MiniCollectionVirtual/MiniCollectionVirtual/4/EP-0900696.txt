<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises two or more adjoining perfectly flat
suitably oriented adjoining mirrors. At one end of

the device a rear vision mirror is arranged, whereas,
at the opposite end, a side vision mirror is

provided, between the rear vision mirror and side
vision mirror one or more rear-side vision mirrors

being arranged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an outer
rear-side vision device for motor vehicles providing
undeformed images and unaltered distances.Prior outer mirrors conventionally comprise
rear vision mirrors and are applied to the motor
vehicle respectively at a ten hour position (left
rear mirror) and at a two hour position (right rear
mirror) and they allow the motor vehicle driver to
see the rear part of the motor vehicle inside a rear
vision angle or range respectively extending from
five or six hours up to seven or height hours at
maximum (left rear mirror) or from seven or six hours
to five or four hours (right rear mirror) without
compelling the motor vehicle driver to distract
his/her attention from the front vision range of the
motor vehicle, i.e. at hours from ten to two.The above mentioned rear vision devices
conventionally comprise a mirror having a continuous
surface, either flat or slightly curved-convex.The convex curvature broadens, up to the
above indicated maximum values, the normal rear
vision angle or range which can be obtained by using
flat mirrors. However, this presents the drawback of
restituting deformed images and altered distances,
and this drawback increases as the curving ray
decreases and/or changes and depending on the
observed objects being on side or on the rear.This drawback is very serious mainly with
respect to the safety of the road traffic.For example, the slightly curved-convex
rear mirror of a motor vehicle reflects to the motor
vehicle driver a nearly undeformed image, and a
nearly real distance of a vehicle arranged at hour
six, i.e. on the rear on the same driving lane, but,
as the rear vehicle moves to a seven hour position,
i.e. to a side lane in order to pass the front
vehicle, the image thereof is reflected with an
ovalized configuration, and the distance thereof is
increased with respect to the real distance.Moreover, as the rear vehicle achieves a
position corresponding to about eight hour, during
the overtaking operation proper, the image thereof
will appear much more ovalized and distant, thereby
exiting the vision angle or range of the rear mirror.Thus, for continuously seeing the overtaking
vehicle, and for properly controlling the 
position of his/her vehicle, the driver is compelled
to remove his/her eyes from the rear mirror for
directly observing the overtaking vehicle; in other
words, the driver must distract his/her eyes from the
road, to achieve a eight hour position, which would
inevitably increase the risk of an accident.In this connection it

<CLAIMS>
A rear-side vision device for a vehicle,
including at least an holding casing, coupled to said

motor vehicle, characterized in that said device
comprises moreover at least two elementary mirrors

adjoining one another and angled with respect to one
another, thereby eliminating any overlapping or dead

regions between the vision ranges of said mirrors.
A device according to Claim 1, wherein said
device comprises at least a first hinge provided for

changing an orienting angle of one of said elementary
mirrors with respect to an adjoining elementary

mirror.
A device according to Claim 2, wherein a
first of said elementary mirror is a rear mirror and

a second of said elementary mirror is a side mirror,
said side mirror overlapping said rear mirror.
A device according to Claim 3, wherein said
device comprise a second hinge for changing the

orienting of said elementary mirrors with respect to
said casing.
A device according to Claim 3, wherein said
side mirror and said rear mirror are housed in

different holding casings.
A device according to Claim 4 or 5, wherein
said first hinge for changing the orienting angle of

one of said elementary mirrors with respect to an
adjoining elementary mirror, is arranged on a

vertical middle axis of said elementary mirrors.
A device according to Claim 4 or 5, wherein
said first hinge for changing the orienting angle of

one of said adjoining elementary mirror is arranged
laterally of a vertical middle axis of said

elementary mirrors
A device according to Claim 2, wherein said
first elementary mirror is a rear mirror and said

second elementary mirror is a side mirror, said side
mirror and said rear mirror being arranged adjoining

one another in a horizontal direction, and being
coupled to one another by said first hinge for

changing said orienting angle of said two elementary
mirrors, said hinge being arranged near a vertical

crossing axis of said elementary mirrors.
A device according to Claim 2, wherein said
device comprises three elementary mirrors, adjoining

one another in a horizontal direction, a first of
said elementary mirrors being a rear mirror, a second

of said elementary mirrors being a rear-side mirror
and a third of said elementary mirrors being provided

with hinges, each of said hinges being adapted to
change an orienting angle of two adjoining elementary

mirrors.
A device according to one or more of the
preceding Claims, wherein at least one of said

elementary mirrors is slightly convex.
