<ABSTRACT>
A retractable blade scalpel comprises a knife 
blade (22), a flexible envelope (14), and an elongated 

housing (12) forming a blade containment area (32). When 
pressure is applied to the flexible envelope (14) the 

knife blade (22) is longitudinally displaced to a 
protruding usage position. The knife blade (22) remains 

outside the housing as long as pressure is applied to the 
flexible envelope (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a retractable 
blade safety device, in particular a scalpel, for 
surgical uses. Due to the dangers posed to medical personnel who 
treat individuals with certain transmittable diseases, 
such as the AIDS virus, it is necessary that doctors and 
other medical personnel wear surgical gloves in the 
course of performing the respective professional 
activities. Surgeons are in particularly high risk 
positions due to the unavoidable exposure to patient 
blood. Prior art retractable blade safety devices help to 
alleviate some of the risk to medical personnel in 
handling surgical knifes. Prior art actuators for 
retractable blade safety devices include sliding actuator 
buttons (US 4 320 576), sliding thumb pieces (US 4 233 
734), pencil or ballpoint pen-type actuators (US 4 337 
576 and 4 663 846), rotating barrels (US 4 730 613), 
moving shells or shrouds (US 4 393 587 and 4 414 974), 
and mechanisms which convert a radial force into an axial 
force (US 4 757 612). However, such prior art devices present an 
additional difficulty to surgeons in that they are 
difficult to manipulate while wearing surgical gloves. 
Moreover, prior art actuators, particularly slidable  
 
thumb switches and pen type actuators, pose the further 
risk that they may cause puncturing or tearing of 
surgical gloves during use. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a retractable blade scalpel, or other like 
cutting device, which utilizes as an actuator a flexible 
envelope which when compressed, causes a knife blade to 
protrude from within a safe housing. A companion object of the present invention is the 
provision of a retractable blade scalpel which can be 
readily manipulated by surgeons without the risk of 
damaging surgical gloves and other like protective 
clothing. To this end, the invention comprises a knife 
blade, a flexible envelope, and an elongated housing 
forming a blade containment area. The elongated housing serves as a knife handle and 
contains the flexible envelope which is exposed through 
one or more openings in the housing. The flexible 
envelope and the openings are positioned such that at 
least one finger and/or thumb tip of the user will come 
in contact with the flexible envelope when the knife 
handle is grasped. When pressure is applied to the 
flexible envelope, the knife blade is longitudinally 
displaced from within the elongated housing to protrude 
exteriorly of the housing for usage.  Pressure applied to the flexible envelope causes

<CLAIMS>
A retractable blade cutting device comprising: 
   an elongated housing (12) forming a blade 

containment area (32) and an envelope containment area 
(34); 

   a blade (22) reciprocally movable between a 
withdrawn position within said blade containment area 

(32) and extended position protruding exteriorly of said 
housing (12); 

   a flexible envelope (14) partially enclosed within 
said envelope containment area (34), said envelope (14) 

containing a fluid (16) and having at least one actuator 
surface (40) accessible from the exterior of said housing 

(12); and 
   transmission means including a piston (18) 

associated with said blade (22) and engageable by said 
flexible envelope (14) such that when pressure is applied 

to said actuator surface (40), said piston (18) is 
actuated by said envelope (14), causing said blade (22) 

to shift from said withdrawn position to said extended 
position. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said fluid 
(16) within said flexible envelope (14) is a liquid. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
flexible envelope (14) includes a pleated portion which 

extends when pressure is applied to said actuator surface 
(40). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
transmission means further includes resilient means (20) 

for returning said blade (22) to said blade containment 
area (32) when said pressure is relieved. 
A retractable blade cutting device comprising: 
   an elongated housing (12) forming a handle and 

internally defining a blade containment area (32); 
   a blade assembly including a blade (32) mounted 

for reciprocal movement between a retracted position 
contained within said blade containment area (32), and an 

extended position protruding from said blade containment 
area (32) exteriorly of said housing (12); and 

   a flexible envelope (14) containing a fluid (16) 
and arranged within said housing (12) adjacent to said 

blade assembly, said envelope (14) having an actuator 
surface (40) accessible from the exterior of said housing 

(12), wherein said envelope (14) is capable of deforming 
and contacting said blade assembly responsive to pressure 

applied to said actuator surface (40) thereby urging said 
blade (22) into said extended position. 
A device as claimed in claim 5, wherein said fluid 
(16) within said flexible envelope (14) is a liquid. 
A device as claimed in claim 5, wherein said 
flexible envelope (14) includes a pleated portion which 

extends when pressure is applied to said actuator surface 
(40). 
A device as claimed in claim 5, wherein said 
 

device further comprises a resilient means (20) for 
returning said blade (22) to said retracted position when 

said pressure is relieved.
