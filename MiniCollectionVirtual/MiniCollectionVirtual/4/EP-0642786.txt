<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements in and 
relating to laxative compositions and the manufacture 
thereof. Orally administrable compositions containing a stool 
softener in combination with a stimulant laxative are 
known and such compositions may, for example, take the 
form of suspensions containing the active ingredients in 
appropriate liquid carriers for oral administration. It has now been found, in accordance with the 
present invention, that a surprisingly high dose of a 
laxative composition can be incorporated in a small size 
of hard gelatin capsule by dispersing and dissolving the 
stimulant laxative in molten stool softener and filling 
the resultant molten dispersion into capsules. The 
resultant composition thus provides an unexpectedly high 
unit dose of the laxative composition in a 
pharmaceutical form which is of a size and shape for 
elegant, convenient and reliable administration to 
patients. Conventionally a unit dosage form is prepared by 
compressing powders into tablets or encapsulating  
 
powders into hard gelatin capsules. (Thus, for example, 
capsules or sachets containing mixtures of a poloxamer 
and danthron are disclosed in Martindale Extra 
Pharmacopoeia, 28th Edition, London 1982 at page 1364 
and in Irish Medical Journal, Vol. 75, No. 3 at page 
93). To achieve satisfactory powder flow and either 
compression or encapsulation properties, it is 
conventionally necessary to formulate a product with 
excipients such as diluents, compression aids, binders, 
flow aids and lubricants. This is especially true when 
one or more of the active ingredients has undesirable 
physicochemical properties, for example is waxy and/or 
sticky, which make incorporating the ingredient in a 
conventional dosage form particularly difficult. 
Furthermore to ensure that the resulting dosage unit 
will break up and dissolve after administration it is 
usually necessary to add a disintegrant. These 
excipient materials add considerably to the volume of 
the dosage form, and may limit the amount of active 
ingredient(s) which may be incorporated in a unit dosage 
form of acceptable size and volume to ensure acceptance 
by a patient. The encapsulation of molten mixture of a 
poloxamer and tebufelone (an anti-inflammatory agent) is 
disclosed in WO-A-93/23022 and the production of a 
melt-dispersions is described in EP-A-0580860. According to the invention, therefore, there is 
provided a method for the manufacture of a laxative 
composition in unit dosage form which comprises the 
steps

<CLAIMS>
A method for the manufacture of a laxative 
composition in unit dosage form comprising a capsule 

containing a normally solid stool softener and a 
stimulant laxative chararacterized in that it 

comprises the steps of: 

(i) melting the normally solid stool softener; 
(ii) dispersing and/or dissolving the stimulant 
laxative compound in the molten stool softener 

and mixing to obtain a uniform mixture; 
(iii) filling the molten dispersion into hard gelatin 
capsule shells; and 
(iv) allowing the capsules to cool and the melt or 
dispersion to solidify. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the stool 
softener has a melting point from 30 to 90°C, 

preferably 40 to 80°C, when measured after addition 
of the stimulant laxative and/or other minor 

additive which may lower the melting or 
re-solidification point; and the stimulant laxative 

is danthron, bisacodyl, casanthranol, cascara, a 
sennoside or sodium picosulphate.  

 
A method as claimed in claim 2 in which the stool 
softener is a poloxamer and the stimulant laxative 

is danthron. 
A method as claimed in claim 3 in which the weight 
ratio of poloxamer to danthron is between 2:1 and 

20:1, preferably between 4:1 and 15:1 and most 
preferably between 8:1 and 13.3:1.
