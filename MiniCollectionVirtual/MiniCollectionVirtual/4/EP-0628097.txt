<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to producing optically 
useful crystals of MTiOXO₄, wherein M is selected from 
the group consisting of NH₄, K, Rb, Tl, mixtures thereof 
and mixtures of Cs therewith, and X is selected from the 
group consisting cf P, As and mixtures thereof, and more 
particularly to hydrothermal processes for producing 
such crystals. The need for optical quality single crystals of 
materials exhibiting nonlinear optical properties is 
well established in the art. Potassium titanyl 
phosphate (i.e. KTP) is particularly useful in nonlinear 
optical devices, as described, for example, in U.S. 
Patent No. 3,949,323. Optical quality crystals having 
dimensions on the order of one millimeter or more are 
particularly useful for many optical applications. Processes for producing optical quality crystals 
using aqueous systems are known generally in the art as 
hydrothermal processes, and processes for producing such 
crystals using nonaqueous molten salt systems are known 
generally in the art as flux processes. Hydrothermal 
processes are considered particularly advantageous 
relative to flux processes for growing crystals for 
certain applications since hydrothermal processes often 
produce crystals having better optical damage resistance 
and relatively lower ionic conductivity. Typically, 
hydrothermal processes involve growing the crystal in a 
vessel having a growth region where the crystal grows 
and a nutrient region containing nutrient for growing  
 
the crystal, and employ an aqueous mineralizer solution 
(i.e., a mineralizer). For example, one type of mineralizer used for 
hydrothermal crystal growth of KTP uses a mineralizer 
containing both potassium and phosphate. A typical 
commercial production of KTP crystals, described by Belt 
et al., SPIE Proceedings, 968, 100 (1988), uses a 
potassium phosphate mineralizer at a temperature in the 
range of about 520°C to 560°C and a pressure in the 
range of about 1.72 X 10⁺⁸ Pa to 2.03 10⁺⁸ Pa (1700 to 2000 atm.). The 
relatively high temperature and pressure employed in 
this process makes scale-up difficult and expensive. As 
suggested in Laudise et al., "Solubility and P-V-T 
Relations and the Growth of Potassium Titanyl 
Phosphate", Journal of Crystal Growth, 102, pp. 427-433 
(1990) the use of more moderate conditions can lead to a 
problem of the coprecipitation of anatase (TiO₂), making 
the process less useful. Mineralizers rich in potassium 
have been used under conditions of fairly moderate 
temperature (e.g.,275 to 425°C) and
