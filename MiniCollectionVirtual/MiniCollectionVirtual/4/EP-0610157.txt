<ABSTRACT>
Wall cladding comprising square and triangular individual elements. In relation to the fall line of the vertical or sloping wall, the square elements stand on their points, i.e. with their diagonals parallel to the edges of the wall delimited at right angles. All the elements are provided, on the edges parallel to the sides of the square, with folds which are folded over through 180@: towards the outside on the upwardly directed edges, and towards the wall on the downwardly directed edges. The first set of triangular elements, produced from the squares by a single division along the diagonal, serve to clad the edges, and the second set of triangles, produced by dividing squares along two diagonals, serve to clad the corners. The elements are fastened on the wall, at their upper, right-angled corners, by means of pins. The wall cladding is laid in a manner continuing from bottom to top. The elements of the next row above are pushed, by means of their folds which are folded inwards, into the outwardly directed folds of the lower row. The result is a continuous surface covering which protects the wall against downwardly running water. Since the folds may be very narrow (at least 2% of the side of a square), the result is a gap-free covering with a minimal requirement in terms of cladding elements.
