A circuit arrangement for supplying power to a fan 
(18) and/or battery (17) by means of a solar generator (11) 

in a vehicle (14) and with, serving to adapt impedances 
between the solar generator and the fan or accumulator, a 

direct current voltage converter (19) comprising a switch 
(20) which is alternately opened and closed by a pulse-width-modulated 

actuating signal, characterised in that to 
generate the pulse width modulated actuating signal, a 

microprocessor (10), a frequency generator (26) and a pulse 
width modulator (27) which is subject to the output signal 

from the frequency generator and the control signal from 
the microprocessor, are provided and can, as a function of 

a change-over signal, be used optionally also as components 
of an actuating means (33) for changing the position of a 

movable part of a sun roof (13). 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that downstream of the pulse width 

modulator (27) is an end stage (30) which can likewise be 
used optionally for actuating the direct current voltage 

converter (19) or the sun roof actuating means (33). 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 2, 
characterised by a current measuring unit (34) for 

delivering a current measurement signal to the 
microprocessor (10) as a function of the current flowing 

in the end stage (30) when the end stage is being used both 
for operating the direct current voltage converter (19) and 

also the sun roof actuating means (33). 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that when the pulse 

width modulator (27) is being used to actuate the end stage 
(30) or the switch (20) of the direct current voltage  

 
converter (19), there is applied to the microprocessor (10) 

a voltage measuring signal which is a measure of the output 
voltage from the direct current voltage converter and in 

that the microprocessor is so designed and/or programmed 
that it seeks to maximise the direct current voltage 

converter output voltage by modifying the control signal 
which passes to the pulse width modulator. 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that a filter stage (39) for damping or 

suppressing interference signals superimposed on the 
voltage measuring signal is incorporated between the output 

from the direct current voltage converter (19) and the 
input of the microprocessor (10) which receives the voltage 

measuring signal. 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the end stage (30) is connected in 

parallel to minimise leakage losses of a diode (23) which 
forms a part of the direct current voltage converter (19). 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised by a temperature sensor 

(40) which, depending upon the ambient temperature, applies 
a temperature measurement signal to the microprocessor (10) 

to influence the control signal which passes to the pulse 
width modulator (27). 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the sun roof 

actuating means (33) is designed as an automatic 
preselection unit which comprises a desired value 

transmitter (43) for the desired setting of the movable sun 
roof part (12) and, associated with the movable sun roof 

part a drive (46) which is part of a control circuit which 
compares the actual position of the movable sun roof part  

 
with the desired position to which the desired value 

transmitter has been set and moves the movable sun roof 
part until the control deviation has been reduced to zero.
