<ABSTRACT>
An arbor 1 having an axis of rotation 2 comprises a body member 3 having end 4 with
flats so that it may be drivably secured in a spindle or chuck of a machine or machine tool. The

body member 3 has a co-axial socket 5 provided at its opposite, cutting end 6 to receive a shank
of a rotary cutter (not shown), the shank having, in the conventional manner, at least one flat. The

arbor 1, further comprises a collar 7 carried at the cutting end 6, which collar 7 is biassed by a
torsion spring 8 to an active position and is manually rotatable, within limits, against the spring

bias, to an inactive position. A cam surface 9 is provided internally of the collar 7 and a
segmental key 10 which is biassed radially outwardly by a pair of coil compression springs 11

to a cutter release position, has a flat, abutment surface 12, and an opposed, curved, displacement
surface 13 engageable by the cam surface 9, and is also carried by the cutting end of the arbor,

which key 10 is upon suitable manual rotation of the collar permitted to be displaced under its
spring bias to the cutter release position, in which the key 10 is clear of the socket 5 to permit

insertion, or removal, of a shank of a cutter into, or from, the socket. Upon manual release of
the collar 7 permitting rotation of the collar under its spring bias, to an active position, at least

the abutment surface 12 of the key 10 penetrates a portion of the socket 5 to engage a, or the, flat
of an inserted cutter shank, with the cam surface 9 of the collar maintaining engagement with the

displacement surface 13 of the key 10 to maintain the key 10 in its active position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an arbor adapted to be fitted a clamping end to, a chuck, spindle
etc of a machine, or machine tool, and at a cutting end to receive and clamp a cutter.A known arbor comprises, towards its cutting end, a pair of tapped, radial holes extending
at 90Â° to one another. Each hole receives a grub screw with a recessed hexagon head to receive
an Allen key, so that the grub screws may be screwed in, to engage flats provided on a shank of
the cutter, to clamp the shank onto a receiving socket of the cutting end.It is not unknown for Allen keys to be lost, for only wrong sized Allen keys to be
available, or for the grub screws to be cross-threaded, particularly for on site or remote locations,
such as railway track, where a solution might not readily be available.Furthermore, only the ends of the grub screws are in contact with the flats, providing
relatively limited effective clamping areas.In FR 2243758A on which is based the preamble of claim 1, is described a quick release arbor with a pin, spring loaded radially
outwardly, having a flat inner surface adapted to engage a flat of a shank of a cutter, and with an
opposed arcuate surface, adapted to engage a cam surface of a co-axial, spring loaded collar. The
single pin provides limited contact area with the flat of a shank of a cutter tool.In US 3030121 is described a self-tightening chuck for a drill bit, the chuck having a key
pivotally attached to a portion of the chuck, the key being manually pivotable between an
inactive, release position, and an active position in which a flat of the drill bit is engaged by a flat 
of the key, with a manually operable clamping collar adapted to be screwed along a threaded
portion of the chuck between key engaging or non-engaging positions during the course of fitting,
or removal, of a drill shank.A basic object of the invention is the provision of an improved arbor.According to the present invention, there is provided an arbor
comprising the features of claim 1. The arbor in accordance with the invention provides a quick release, screwless action, 
avoiding the drawbacks of grub screws, and the time taken to tighten or release such screws
during the fitting or replacement of a cutter.Furthermore, the abutment surface of the key provides a substantially increased contact
area with the engaged flat of the cutter shank.Furthermore, the arbor in accordance with the invention requires but a single flat, and
hence can accommodate a miscellany of cutters of different manufacturers having 1,2, 3 or 4
fla

<CLAIMS>
An arbor (1) having a longitudinal axis of rotation (2) and comprising a body member (3) having
a clamping end (4) adapted to be drivably secured in a spindle or chuck etc of a machine or

machine tool, and having a co-axial socket (5) at its opposite, cutting end to (6) receive a shank
of a rotary cutter, the shank having at least one flat, the arbor comprising a rotatable

collar (7) carried by its cutting end, which collar is spring biassed in one direction of rotation
to an active position and is manually rotatable, within limits, against the spring bias (8), to

an inactive position; a cam surface (9) provided internally of the collar (7); and a pin (10) also carried
by the cutting end of the arbor, which pin is spring biassed (11) radially outwardly to a cutter

release position, having a flat, abutment surface (12) to engage, after displacement to a cutter
clamping position a corresponding flat of a shank of a cutter, the pin (10) having an opposed,

curved, displacement surface (13) engageable by the cam surface (9) of the collar, and which pin,
upon suitable manual rotation of the collar (7), is permitted to be displaced radially

outwardly under its spring bias, to the cutter release position, in which position the pin (10)
is clear of the socket to permit insertion, or removal, of a shank of a cutter into, or from,

the socket, and upon manual release of the collar (7), permitting rotation of the collar under
its spring bias, to displace the pin (10) radially inwardly against its spring bias to a cutter

clamping position, in which at least the abutment surface (12) of the pin penetrates a portion
of the socket to engage a flat of an inserted cutter shank, with the cam surface (9) of

the collar maintaining its engagement with the displacement surface (13) of the pin, to
maintain the pin (10) in its cutter clamping position, 
characterised in that
(i) the pin is in the form of a key (10) of segmental shape having firstly an arcuate
displacement surface (13) in engagement with the cam surface (9) of the collar

(7), and secondly an opposed, chordal flat abutment surface (12) adapted, in use, 
to engage a flat of a shank of a rotary cutter, and
(ii) the body member (3) is provided with spaced-apart, parallel, radially extending
faces defining a key receiving slot (14), which intersects the socket (5), whereby,

upon manual rotation of the collar (7) against its spring bias, the key (10), under
the influence of its spring bias automatically retracts 
radially,
 having regard to
the axis of rotation of the arbor, from a cutter clamping position against the cam

surface (9) of the collar (7), to permit insertion of a cutter shank, and after such
insertion, manual release of the collar (7) permits the key (10) to be displaced


radially
 inwardly by the bias of the spring means (11).
An arbor as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the transverse slot (14) is provided
with two spaced-apart blind holes (15), each to receive one end of a coil compression

spring (11), which at their other ends bear on the abutment surface (12) of the key (10)
to bias the latter radially outwardly towards its cutter release position, clear of the socket

(5).
An arbor as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the spring bias on the
collar (7) is provided by a torsion spring (8), one end of which engages an aperture (18)

in the body member (3), and the other end (16) of which engages an aperture (17) in the
collar (7), to rotationally bias the collar (7) to a position in which its cam surface (9)

urges the key (10) radially inwardly into its cutter clamping position, penetrating the
socket (5).
An arbor as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 the body member (3)
is provided with a circumferential flange (19) against which one end of the collar (7) is

adapted to abut, with the collar (7) being retained on the cutting end (6) of the body
member (3) by a circlip (20).
An arbor as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 the clamping end (4)
of the body member (3) is appropriately profiled eg by having a Morse taper, for the

spindle etc in which it is to be clamped.
