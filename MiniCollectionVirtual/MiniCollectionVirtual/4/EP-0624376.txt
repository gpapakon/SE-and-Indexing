<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is a method for removing toxic 
lipooligosaccharide (LOS) from outer membranes of Gram-negative 

cocci, such as 
Neisseria meningitidis
. LOS-depleted 
outer membranes and LOS-depleted soluble outer 

membrane proteins can be prepared, which are able to 
elicit bactericidal antibodies against homologous 

strains of bacteria. Vaccines and other uses of the 
preparations are further described.

<DESCRIPTION>
Antoine van Leeuwenhoek (1987), 53: 413-419 discloses the
isolation of outer membrane proteins by detergent extraction of
bacteria.Bacterial meningitis is an inflammatory disease of
the central nervous system caused by the growth of
bacteria in and adjacent to the leptomeninges. It is an
acute, and often lethal, infectious disease that affects
children and young adults. One of the most common
causes of bacterial meningitis worldwide is infection
with Neisseria meningitidis. The occurrence of
infection with this bacterium is unpredictable, since
many people become colonized without exhibiting the
disease. Some people are temporary carriers, while
others are chronic carriers, discharging meningococci
either more or less continuously or in a sporadic
fashion. During the course of infection, bactericidal
antibodies are produced in the infected person, which
apparently immunize the person against subsequent
infection (Goldschneider et al., 1969). This
observation has led to the expectation that vaccines
based on bacterial antigens may be effective against
meningitis.N. meningitidis is a Gram-negative coccus.
Characteristically, it is surrounded by a cell envelope
composed of an inner plasma membrane, a periplasmic
space, and an outer membrane or cell wall. The outer
membrane is composed of lipooligosaccharide (LOS)
molecules, lipids, proteins and polysaccharides. The
protective antibodies produced in infected people were
found to be directed against both the capsular
polysaccharides and the outer membrane proteins (Frasch,
1983). Strains of N. meningitidis have been classified
into serogroups according to the type (antigenically and
biochemically) of the capsule. Currently recognized
serogroups include A, B, C, D, W135, X, Y, Z and 29E.
The polysaccharides responsible for the serogroup
specificity of groups A, B, C, X, W135 and Y have been
purified. A tetravalent vaccine based on purified
capsular polysaccharides from serogroups A, C, Y and W
135 has been developed (Hankins et al., 1982). However,
the lack of immunogenicity in the under 2 years age
group, the age group most at risk from meningococcal
infection, has limited the usefulness of this vaccine.
The capsule of Group B N. meningitidis is poorly
immunogenic in all age groups, even when conjugated to a
carrier protein. There is evidence that antibodies to
this capsule may cross react with brain tissue of fetal
and newborn infants.The major outer membrane proteins (omp) of N.
meningitidis have been divided into five classes on the
basis of structural
