<ABSTRACT>
The dowel comprises a socket (2) through which passes a screw inserted in a closed proximal face side of the socket as far as a through hole (6). At least two slots run in the socket from the distal end to the proximal end over two-thirds of its length. A nut (7) screwable onto the screw (5) engages in the socket from the distal end. The nut has a circular cross-section and starting from a cylindrical part (7') has a cover surface (8) conically widening to the open socket end. The dia. of the cylindrical section (7') corresponds to the inner dia. of the socket (2). The outer cover surface of the socket is coated with a three-dimensional open mesh space net structure.

<CLAIMS>
Vertebral body fusion dowel (1), consisting of a sleeve (2) and a screw
penetrating the sleeve, which is inserted into the sleeve at the proximal end face

of the latter which is closed except for a bore (6) for the screw, characterised
by at least two slots (3) extending in the sleeve (2) from its distal end to the

proximal end over essentially 2/3 of its length, and a nut (7) which can be
screwed using the screw (5) and engages in the sleeve (2) from the distal side,

wherein the nut (7) has a circular cross-section and, starting from a cylindrical
part (7'), a shell surface (8) expanding conically towards the open sleeve end,

and the diameter of the cylindrical section (7') corresponds approximately to
the internal diameter of the sleeve (2).
Vertebral body fusion dowel according to claim 1, in which the outer shell
surface of the sleeve (2) is covered with a three-dimensional open-mesh spatial

net structure (4).
Vertebral body fusion dowel according to claim 1 or 2, in which the nut (7)
is secured by means of a retention device (9) before wringing off from the

screw (5).
Vertebral body fusion dowel according to one of claims 1 to 3, in which one
of the slots (3) is designed as a guide groove (10) in the distal region for a bolt

(11) attached to the nut (7) and acting as a retention device.
