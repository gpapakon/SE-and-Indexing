RF and TV distribution network for the
distribution of an FDM (Frequency Division Multiplex)

signal with a high number of channels, having a
(central) station in which signals from M channels or

channel groups are subjected to frequency-conversion
and combined to form the FDM signal, which is fed into

the network, having further stations in which the
incoming FDM signal is conditioned in such a way that

the signals of a number Ni of further channels can be

accepted into the new FDM signal additionally or at
free frequency channels or instead of the signals of

freely selectable, allocated channels, having
subscriber devices in which the FDM signal is split

into the individual channel or channel group signals
and conditioned in such a way that the subscriber can

access them,

in which

a digital frequency division multiplex converter (DFMU)
is provided at least in the central station for the

frequency conversion and for the combination of the
signals of the M channels or channel groups, in which

converter the signals of the channels or channel
groups, which signals are sampled at a uniform sampling

rate and digitized, are subjected to frequency-conversion
in each case with an increase in the

sampling rate in interpolating digital frequency 
converters (IDFU) and are combined by means of at least

one adder (CA), and in which a plurality of such
frequency-converted and combined signals are combined

to form the FDM signal, characterized in that the
signals which have been subjected to frequency-conversion

and combined by means of adders (CA) are
subjected to frequency-conversion in a second stage by

means of group bandpass filters (CGBF) with a further
increase in the sampling rate and are combined by means

of a further adder (RA) to form the FDM signal.
(Figures 1 and 1b).
RF and TV distribution network for the
distribution of an FDM signal with a high number of

channels, having a central station (Z) having a digital
frequency division multiplex converter (DFMU), by means

of which signals from M channels or channel groups at
the frequencies f
1
 to f
M
 are subjected to frequency
conversion and combined to form the FDM signal, which

is fed into the network, having further stations in
which the incoming FDM signal is conditioned in such a

way that the signals of a number Ni of further channels
can be accepted into the new FDM signal additionally at

free frequency channels or instead of the signals of
freely selectable, allocated channels, having subscriber

devices in which the FDM signal is split into
the individual channel or channel group signals and

conditioned in such a way that the subscriber can
access them, characterized in that the distribution

network has a ring structure, in that N single channel
bandpass filters (EKBF) are additionally provided in

the central station, which filters are transparent only
to single channels having the respective frequencies fM

+ 1 to fM + N and into which filters the FDM signal
received from the supplying ring end is fed, and in

that the single channel bandpass filter output signals
are added to the output signal of the digital frequency

division multiplex converter (DFMU), and in that the
summation signal is the FDM signal which is fed into

the outgoing ring end (Figure 4). 
Distribution network according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the single channel bandpass

filters (EKBF) are realized by the cascade of a
decimating digital frequency converter (DDFU) and of a

downstream interpolating digital frequency converter
(IDFU) (Figure 5a).
Distribution network according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a respective

drop-add multiplexer (DAMUX) is provided in each
further station for the acceptance of the signals of

further channels, in that this DAMUX filters the
incoming FDM signal by allowing desired channels to

pass and inhibiting channels which are to be kept free
or disconnected, in that the signals of further

channels to be accepted are in each case converted into
the free frequency ranges (f1, f2) provided for them

and, after filtering, are added to the filtered,
incoming FDM signal, and in that this summation signal

is the new FDM signal.
Distribution network according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that, in one or more

of the further stations, the FDM signal undergoes
multiplication by a gain factor Î³ 
<
 1.
Distribution network according to one of the
preceding Claims 4 or 5 with 4, characterized in that

the drop-add multiplexer (DAMUX), for inhibiting
individual channels, uses single channel bandpass

filters (EKBF) which are each fed by the FDM signal,
and in that their output signals are subtracted from

the FDM signal.
Distribution network according to Claim 6,
characterized in that in order to compensate for the

propagation delay of the single channel bandpass
filters (EKBF), the FDM signal is delayed by the same

propagation delay after the feeding into the individual
single channel bandpass filters (EKBF) and prior to the

difference formation. (Figure 5b).
Distribution network according to Claim 1 or
one of Claims 2 to 7, characterized in that the 

stations are provided with electro-optical transmitters
and optoelectronic receivers for the transmission of

the FDM signal via optical fibres (LWL).
Distribution network according to Claim 1 or
one of the preceding Claims 2 to 8, characterized in

that the stations are provided with digital-to-analog
and analog-to-digital converters for the analog

transmission of the FDM signal.
Distribution network according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the increase in the sampling rate

is effected after the addition operation (Figure 1b).
