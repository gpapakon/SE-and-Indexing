<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to processing of silver
halide photographic elements. More specifically, it
relates to the fixing of photographic elements
comprising silver chloride using an aqueous solution
containing sulfite as a fixing agent.The basic image-forming process of silver
halide photography comprises the exposure of a silver
halide photographic element to actinic radiation (for
example, light or X-rays), and the manifestation of a
usable image by the wet, chemical processing of the
element. The fundamental steps of this processing
entail, first, treatment of the photographic element
with one or more developing agents wherein some of the
silver halide is reduced to metallic silver. With
black-and-white photographic materials, the metallic
silver usually comprises the desired image. With color
photographic materials, the useful image consists of
one or more images in organic dyes produced from an
oxidized developing agent formed where silver halide is
reduced to metallic silver.To obtain useful black-and-white images it is
usually desirable to remove the undeveloped silver
halide, and to obtain useful color images it is usually
desirable to remove all of the silver from the
photographic element after the image has been formed.
In black-and-white photography the removal of
undeveloped silver halide is accomplished by dissolving
it with a silver halide solvent, commonly referred to
as a fixing agent. In color photography the removal of
silver is generally accomplished by oxidizing the 
metallic silver, and dissolving the oxidized metallic
silver and undeveloped silver halide with a fixing
agent. The oxidation of metallic silver is achieved
with an oxidizing agent, commonly referred to as a
bleaching agent. The dissolution of oxidized silver
and undeveloped silver halide can be accomplished
concurrently with the bleaching operation in a bleach-fix
process using a bleach-fix solution, or subsequent
to the bleaching operation by using a separate
processing solution containing a fixing agent.It is highly desirable to process a
photographic element as rapidly as feasible, and a
shortened process compared to ones known in the art is
highly desired. Shortening the silver removal step,
which consumes a large amount of the total process
time, is one manner in which to shorten the overall
processing time. Juxtaposed to the desire for an
accelerated process is the desire for, and the need
for, photographic elements and processing solutions
that require lower chemical usage and that generate
less polluting chemical
