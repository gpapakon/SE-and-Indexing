<ABSTRACT>
Multimeric hemoglobin-like proteins are obtained by crosslinking cysteines, natural or artificial, of the component tetramers, or by genetically fusing globin-like domains of one tetramer with those of another, by means of an interdomain spacer sequence. Artificial cysteines are introduced selectively in a single globin-like domain per tetramer to control polymerization.

<DESCRIPTION>
Hoffman and Nagai,
U.S. Patent No. 5,028,588,
presently owned by Somatogen, Inc., relates to the use of
low oxygen affinity and other mutant hemoglobins as blood
substitutes, and to the expression of alpha and beta globin
in nonerythroid cells. Hoffman and Nagai, U.S. Patent No. 5,449,759
discloses certain
additional dicysteine hemoglobin mutants; it is a
continuation-in-part of the application leading to U.S. Patent No. 5,028,588. The present invention is directed to multimeric
hemoglobin-like proteins composed of two or more
pseudotetramers linked together either by genetic fusion or
by chemical crosslinking.Hemoglobin (Hgb) is the oxygen-carrying component
of blood. Hemoglobin circulates through the bloodstream
inside small enucleate cells called erythrocytes (red blood
cells). Hemoglobin is a protein constructed from four
associated polypeptide chains, and bearing prosthetic
groups known as hemes. The erythrocyte helps maintain
hemoglobin in its reduced, functional form. The heme iron
atom is susceptible to oxidation, but may be reduced again
by one of two enzyme systems within the erythrocyte, the
cytochrome b5 and glutathione reduction systems.The structure of hemoglobin is well known. We
herewith incorporate by reference the entire text of Bunn
and Forget, eds., Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and
Clinical Aspects (W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA:
1986) and of Fermi and Perutz "Hemoglobin and Myoglobin,"
in Phillips and Richards, Atlas of Molecular Structures in
Biology (Clarendon Press: 1981).About 92% of the normal adult human hemolysate is
Hgb A (designated alpha2 beta2, because it comprises two
alpha and two beta chains). Other recognized hemoglobin
species are Hgb A2 (α2 δ2), Hgb A1a, Hgb A1b, and Hgb A1c, as 
well as the rare species Hgb F (α2 gamma2), Hgb Gower-1
(Zeta2 epsilon2), Hgb Gower-2 (alpha2 epsilon2), Hgb Portland
(Zeta2 gamma2), and Hgb H (beta4) and Hgb Bart (gamma4).
They are distinguished from Hgb A by a different selection
of polypeptide chains.The primary structure of a polypeptide is defined
by its amino acid sequence and by identification of any
modifications of the side chains of the individual amino
acids. The amino acid sequences of both the alpha and beta
globin polypeptide chains of "normal" human hemoglobin is
given in Table 1. Many mutant forms are also known;
several mutants are identified in Table 400. The wild-type
alpha chain consists of 141 amino acids. The iron atom of
the heme (ferroprotoporphyrin IX) group is bound covalently
to the imidazole of His 87
