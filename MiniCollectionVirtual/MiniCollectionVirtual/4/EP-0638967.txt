<ABSTRACT>
The connector consists of a contact strip (1) and a contact element carrier (2) to which the contact strip can be detachably connected by means of latching devices (13, 14). The contact element carrier (2) is constructed from individual, mutually parallel subassemblies (2a, 2b) which are pressed into a printed circuit board, so that any defective contact elements can be replaced, after unlocking the contact strip and the contact element carrier and removing the contact strip, simply by removing the relevant subassembly.

Method of fastening a right-angle plug-in
connector comprising a contact strip (1) and a contact

element carrier (2) with individual, mutually parallel
subassemblies (2a, 2b) on a printed circuit board (9)

by a press-fitting technique, characterized in that
each subassembly (2a, 2b) is pressed individually into

the printed circuit board (9) until the contact element
carrier (2), comprising a number of subassemblies (2a,

2b), is completely formed, and in that, after press-fitting
of the individual subassemblies (2a, 2b), the

contact strip (1) is pushed onto the complete contact
element carrier (2) and is detachably connected to the

latter.
Plug-in connector for carrying out the method
according to Claim 1, having a contact strip (1),

consisting of insulating material and receiving contact
elements (5) in mutually parallel rows and columns,

with a plug-in side and a connection side, opposite the
said plug-in side, for a contact element carrier (2),

which consists of insulating material and is formed by
individual, mutually parallel subassemblies (2a, 2b)

which receive the contact elements (5) of one column in
each case, the contact elements (5) protruding with

their plug-in region (4) into the contact strip (1) and
being designed as press-fitting pins (6) at their

connection region running at right angles with respect
to the plugging direction, characterized in that

interacting locking members (13, 14) are provided for
the detachable connection of the contact strip (1) and 

of the contact element carrier (2) in the region of the
connection side of the contact strip (1) and on the

individual subassemblies (2a, 2b).
Plug-in connector according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the locking members (13, 14) are

provided at least on the upper side (11 or 12) of the
contact strip (1) and of the subassemblies (2a, 2b).
Plug-in connector according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the locking members comprise

locking holes (13) provided in the contact strip (1)
and locking lugs (14) arranged on the subassemblies

(2a, 2b).
Plug-in connector according to one of Claims 2
to 4, characterized in that each subassembly (2a, 2b)

is designed with in each case at least one locking
member (14) and the contact strip (1) for each locking

member (14) of the subassemblies (2a, 2b) is designed
with in each case one corresponding locking member

(13).
Plug-in connector according to one of Claims 2
to 5, characterized in that the locking members (13)

are provided in the region of the connection side of

the contact strip (1) in a thin, resilient wall region
(10).
Plug-in connector according to one of Claims 2
to 6, characterized in that the locking members (14) of

the subassemblies (2a, 2b) are bevelled on the side
facing the contact strip (1).
Plug-in connector according to one of Claims 2
to 7, characterized in that the subassemblies (2a) have

in each case an insulating part (7), which extends in
the direction of a column and receives the contact

elements (5) arranged one above the other in a column
only in a narrow region adjoining the plug-in region,

so that the contact elements (5) are surrounded only
partially by insulating material.
Plug-in connector according to one of Claims 2
to 7, characterized in that the subassemblies (2b) have 

in each case a plate-shaped insulating part (8), which
extends in the direction of a column and completely

surrounds the contact elements (5) arranged one above
the other in a column, apart from the plug-in and

connection regions.
Plug-in connector according to Claim 9,
characterized in that the plate-shaped insulating part

(8) comprises two individual parts (8a, 8b) which are
detachably connected to each other and enclose the

contact elements (1) between them.
Plug-in connector according to Claim 8 or 9,
characterized in that the insulating part (7, 8)

comprises a one-piece injection moulding.
