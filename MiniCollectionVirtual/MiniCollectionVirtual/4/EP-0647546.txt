<ABSTRACT>
A car-mounted sound device wherein the portability of a face plate is improved by not equipping it with a 
switch and wherein after the face plate has been removed, the device is not activated even if a switch on a device main 

body (10) is operated. A face plate (30) is detachably provided on the device main body (10), and there is equipped 
not switch but an operation key (320) on this face plate (30). Provided on the sid
e of the device main body (10) 
are a microcomputer (40) for controlling sound signals and an input section (44) constituted by switches for inputting 

various types of information. An activating condition setting means (60) is provided for keeping the microcomputer 
(40) inactive even if a power source switch is operated after the face plate (30) has been removed. This activating 

condition setting means (60) has two switches (62, 64) that are turned on simultaneously when the face plate (30) is 
removed. When the two switches remain turned on, the microcomputer (40) is not activated, and the device main 

body (10) is not operated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an on-vehicle sound
instrument comprising a main instrument body fixedly mounted
on a vehicle, and a portable face plate detachably mounted on
the instrument body.On-vehicle sound instruments such as car radios are often
stolen on parking. Various improvements for preventing thefts
have been made on the instruments.One improvement is that a car radio comprising a main
body and a face plate integrally fixed to the main body is
detachably mounted on a vehicle-side mount. Such an
improvement is superior in that the integral unit of
instrument body and face plate can be removed and carried from
the car and thus preventing potential thefts. It is however
inferior in that the instrument body is relatively heavy.Another improvement is that an on-vehicle sound
instrument comprises a main instrument body fixedly mounted on
a vehicle and only a face plate is detachable from the
instrument body. The face plate includes various operation
keys and indicators disposed on its front panel. Thus, the
interior of the face plate includes switches activated by the
operation keys, display such as liquid-crystal elements, lamps
for providing operational indications and guidance to a user
and other elements. These electronic/electric parts are
mounted, for example, on a single circuit board. In addition,
various connectors are disposed on the backside of the face
plate, and are connected to the circuit board of the face 
plate. On the other hand, the instrument body fixedly mounted
on the vehicle includes counterpart connectors which are to be
electrically connected to the connectors of the face plate,
respectively.As for the latter instrument, the instrument body fixed
on the vehicle cannot be started, if the face plate superior
in portability is removed from the vehicle. Thus, the
instrument body can be prevented from being stolen.Since the prior art sound instrument with the detachable
face plate includes the electronic/electric circuits and
circuit board mounted on the side of the face plate, the
connectors in the face plate must be connected to or
disconnected from those of the instrument body, each time the
face plate is mounted on or dismounted from the instrument
body. The connectors are connected and disconnected so often
as the driver gets on and off the vehicle, and it may result
in poor connections. Moreover, the face plate is not
necessarily always mounted on the instrument body in the
proper orientation. In general, as for the face plate holding
mechanisms of such a type, the

<CLAIMS>
An on-vehicle sound instrument comprising:

an instrument body (410) fixedly mounted on a vehicle;
a portable face plate (430) detachably mounted on a holder (420) of said
instrument body (410);
said instrument body (410) having a first connector (500) including a plurality
of terminals (502, 504, 506) disposed in array;
said face plate (430) comprising:
a second connector (790) having a plurality of terminals (792, 794, 796)
disposed in array each of which is connectable to the respective one of said terminals in

said first connector (500);
a plurality of operation keys (720) for activating said instrument body (410) in
various operational modes;
a plurality of switches (760) each of which is activated by the corresponding
one of said operation keys (720);
a circuit board on which said switches (760) are mounted, said circuit board
connecting said switches (760) and said second connector (790); and
start setting means (450) for placing said instrument body in a startable state;

characterized in that
said start setting means (450) places said instrument body (410) in a startable
state only when both terminals (502, 504) of said first connectors (500) which are provided

at both opposite ends of the array, are connected to the corresponding terminals (792, 794)
provided at both opposite ends of the array of said second connector (790), and
said holder (420) of said instrument body (410) includes an engaging portion
(620) at one end in the direction parallel to that of said arrays and wherein said face plate

(430) includes a portion (750) to be engaged with said engaging portion, said portion (750)
to be engaged being formed in said face plate (430) at one end in the direction parallel to

that of said array, whereby said face plate (430) can be mounted on or dismounted from 
said instrument body (410) when said face plate (430) is rotated around a point at which

said engaging portion (620) and said portion (750) to be engaged are engaged with each
other.
An on-vehicle sound instrument as defined in claim 1, wherein said face
plate (430) includes a liquid-crystal display section (706) driven by signals from said

instrument body (410) and wherein each of said first and second connectors (500, 790)
includes liquid-crystal drive terminals located between said terminals (792, 794) at the

opposite ends in the direction of the arrays.
An on-vehicle sound instrument as defined in claim 1 or 2, wherein said
instrument body (410) includes a microcomputer (440) having a chip enable terminal (CE),

said microcomputer (440) being started when a voltage is applied to said chip enable
terminal (CE) through a power supply line and wherein said start setting means (450) can
