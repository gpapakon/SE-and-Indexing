<ABSTRACT>
A leader card (16) is provided which is attachable to a 
photographic filmstrip (10) having a lead end with a pair of 

apertures (14). The leader card (16) includes an essentially flat 
piece of material having an aperture (18) and a slit (10) extending 

from the aperture to an edge (22) of the flat piece of material 
to define a pair of flaps (24) of the flat piece of material 

between its aperture (18), slit (20) and edge (22). The flaps (24) are 
sized to 

extend through a pair of apertures (14) in a lead end of a 
filmstrip (10) to secure the flat piece of material and the lead 

end together.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of
photography, and more particularly to a leader card used to
pull photographic film through a photofinishing apparatus.
Specifically, the invention relates to a leader card
attachable to a photographic filmstrip having a lead end
with a pair of apertures.In order to develop exposed photographic film, it
is necessary to contact the film with a number of solutions
including a developer, fix and wash solution. One way to
contact the film with these solutions is to attach a leader
card to the lead end of one or more filmstrips and pull or
tow the leader card through a film processor which contains
the various solutions. When the leader card is pulled
through the film processor, the film is likewise pulled
through the film processor behind the leader card. The film
is pulled through tanks containing the various developing
solutions. After the film has been contacted by the
developing solutions, the film is dried and is caused to
exit the film processor.Typically, the film exits the film processor in
long strips, with the leader card still attached, and falls
into a receptacle. An operator periodically takes the
strips of film from the receptacle, with the leader card
attached, and manually removes the filmstrips from the
leader card. The film can then be inserted into a
photographic printer to make prints of the images stored on
the developed film.A problem with letting the developed film and
leader card fall into a receptacle is that the film can
become damaged when it lands in the receptacle and/or when 
it is contacted by other film in the receptacle. The film
can become further damaged during transport by the operator
from the film processor to the photographic printer. For
example, the operator may impart fingerprints to the film
while carrying the film to the printer.One way to greatly reduce the chance of the film
becoming damaged after it exits the film processor is to
feed the film into an intermediate storage cartridge or the
original film cartridge as the film exits the processor. As
such, the film cannot be contacted by the receptacle, other
film or an operators hands. Additionally, placing the film
back in the film cartridge facilitates making prints from
the film and/or returning the film to the customer. In
order to efficiently insert the film into the intermediate
cartridge, it is preferable to automatically remove the
leader card from the lead end of the film after the lead end
has exited the film processor. Present leader cards do not

Apparatus for automatically removing a leader
card (16) from a photographic filmstrip (10), wherein the leader card

has an aperture (18) and a slit (20) extending from the aperture to an
edge (22) of the leader card to define a pair of flaps (24) of the

leader card between its aperture, slit and edge which are
sized to extend through a pair of apertures (14) in a lead end (12) of

the photographic filmstrip, said apparatus comprising:

means (30) for supporting said photographic filmstrip; and
means (40) for providing relative movement between said lead
end of said photographic filmstrip and said leader card such

that said lead end and said leader card are moved away from
each other in a direction essentially perpendicular to a

plane which includes said lead end and said leader card to
remove said flaps from said pair of apertures, thereby

separating said lead end and said leader card.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said
providing means includes:


a surface (32) for supporting the lead end of said filmstrip
between said pair of apertures; and
means (34) for pushing said leader card in a direction
essentially perpendicular to a plane which includes said

leader card such that said flaps are withdrawn from said
pair of apertures causing said leader card to be removed

from said filmstrip.
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said
pushing means is effective to push said leader card adjacent

both of said flaps.
The apparatus of claim 1, further including:

   means (48) for automatically inserting said photographic
filmstrip into a film cartridge (46).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said pair
of apertures in said filmstrip each have a length at least

as long as the length of said flaps
in a direction extending along the filmstrip. 
A combination of a leader card (16) and a lead end
of a photographic filmstrip (10) for use in a photofinishing

apparatus, comprising:

a leader card having an aperture (18) and a slit (20) extending
from the aperture to an edge (22) of the leader card to define a

pair of flaps (24) of the leader card between its aperture, slit
and edge; and
a lead end of a photographic filmstrip (10), said lead end
having a pair of apertures (14), said pair of flaps being sized

to extend through said pair of apertures to secure the
leader card and lead end of the filmstrip together.
The combination of claim 6, wherein said pair
of apertures in said lead end of said filmstrip each have a

length at least as long as the length of said pair of flaps in a direction extending along the filmstrip.
A leader card (16) attachable to a photographic
filmstrip (10) having a lead end (12) with a pair of apertures (14), the

leader card comprising:

   an essentially flat piece of material having an
aperture (18) and a slit (20) extending from the aperture to an edge (22)

of the flat piece of material to define a pair of flaps (24) of
the flat piece of material between its aperture, slit and

edge which are sized to extend through the pair of apertures
in the lead end of said filmstrip to secure the flat piece of

material and the lead end together.
The leader card of claim 8, wherein said flat
piece of material is made of plastic.
The leader card of claim 8, wherein said
aperture in said flat piece of material has a width at least

as wide as the width of the portion of the lead end of said
photographic filmstrip which separates the pair of apertures

in the lead end of the filmstrip.
