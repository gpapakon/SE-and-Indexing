<ABSTRACT>
Circuit arrangement for adjusting the parallel-path current of a push-pull output stage which has two transistors (1, 2, 21, 22) of opposite conduction type and is driven by an input signal (6), in the case of which an actuator (9, 23, 24) is used to adjust the parallel-path currents of the push-pull output stage (1, 2, 21, 22) and of a comparison circuit (11, 12, 25 to 30) to the effect that a variable which is supplied to the circuit arrangement, is derived from the comparison circuit (11, 12, 25 to 30) and is proportional to the parallel-path current of the push-pull output stage (1, 2, 21, 22) corresponds to a reference variable.

Push-pull output stage which is driven by an
input signal (6), having a circuit arrangement for

setting the parallel-path current which flows through two
transistors (21, 22) of opposite conduction types of the

push-pull output stage,

in which, via an actuator (7, 8, 23, 24), the parallel-path
currents of the push-pull output stage (21, 22) and

of a comparison circuit (25 to 30) are set to the effect
that a quantity which is fed to it, is derived from the

comparison circuit (25 to 30) and is proportional to the
parallel-path current of the push-pull output stage (21,

22) corresponds to a reference quantity,
in which the actuator provided is in the form of two
current sources (7, 8), which are controlled by the input

signal (6), supply opposite currents of the same
magnitude and are coupled to one another via a

controllable load (23, 24), the current sources (7, 8)
for their part respectively driving one of the two

transistors (21, 22) of the push-pull output stage and
the comparison circuit (25 to 30),
in which the controllable load (23, 24) comprises two
field-effect transistors (23, 24) of opposite conduction

types, which transistors are driven in antiphase with
respect to one another and the load paths of which

transistors are reverse-connected in parallel with one
another,
in which the comparison circuit (25 to 30) contains two
constant-current sources (28, 30), which supply opposite

currents of the same magnitude and respectively feed one 
of two further transistors (25, 26) of opposite

conduction types, the further transistors (25, 26)
respectively being driven by one of the controlled

current sources (7, 8) and the respective voltage drops
across the load paths of the further transistors (25, 26)

being provided for driving the respective field-effect
transistors (23, 24) of the load (23, 24),
in which the load path of a respective additional
transistor (32, 31) of the respectively identical

conduction type is connected in series with the load
paths of the further transistors (25, 26), which

additional transistor is driven by the voltage drop
across the load path of the respectively associated

further transistor (25, 26).

compared with a reference current, and the load (9) is 

controlled in dependence on this.
