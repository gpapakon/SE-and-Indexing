<ABSTRACT>
A device and method for preventing fouling and/or corrosion of the exposed surfaces of a structure which is in contact with seawater, brackish water, fresh water, or a combination of these. The system includes using a structure (10) having an exposed zinc-containing surface (16). At the exposed surface water interface a negative capacitive charge or an asymmetric alternating electrostatic is induced and maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to methods 
and apparatus for preventing fouling and/or corrosion of 
structures, and more particularly to methods and 
apparatus for preventing fouling and/or corrosion of 
marine vessels, buoys, piping systems, filters, oil rigs, 
and other structures fully or partially submerged in 
seawater, brackish water, fresh water, or a combination 
of these. Structures in contact with bodies of water suffer 
from fouling and/or corrosion damage. For example the 
shipping industry has long faced serious problems caused 
by the adherence of marine organisms to ship hulls. Such 
fouling of a ship's hull increases the operating cost of 
a ship and decreases its efficiency. Marine organisms which become attached to the hull 
must periodically be removed, thereby usually taking the 
ship out of operation for extended periods of time for 
dry dock maintenance. Also, if fouling is not prevented, 
aquatic organisms will continue to attach to the hull and 
will cause ever increasing operating costs associated 
with additional fuel requirements and decreased speeds. 
The pleasure boat market faces similar problems. Several ways of removing marine organisms, including 
barnacle growth, from a ship are known. Barnacles can be 
mechanically scraped from the ship while in dry dock. 
Cleaning machines have been developed having rotating 
brushes which can remove barnacles and other marine 
organisms from the hull.  
 Another method of overcoming the fouling problems 
has been to use highly toxic paints on the hulls of 
ships. Such paints retard the buildup of marine growth 
on the hull. A toxic element in the paint, such as a 
compound of copper or mercury which is soluble in 
seawater, is controllably dissolved into the water to 
provide protection over several years. However, the 
leaching of toxic materials into esturine waters by a 
vast number of vessels, including the pleasure boat 
population, presents an increasing hazard to the 
environment. For example U.S. Patent No. 3,817,759 discloses the 
use of an antifouling coating comprising a polymeric 
titanium ester of an aliphatic alcohol. Titanium has 
good corrosion resistance and low water solubility which 
prevents premature leaching and exhaustion of the 
coating. Another known antifouling method involves coating 
the hull of a ship with a metallic paint whose ions are 
toxic to marine life, i.e., copper, mercury, silver, tin, 
arsenic, and cadmium, and then to periodically apply a 
voltage to the hull to anodically dissolve
