<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for controlling the speed of a three-phase motor comprises driving stages (8-16) connected directly to three-phase mains (R, S, T), the passing of mains voltage by the driving stages directly to the motor windings being controlled by a pulse width modulated signal which is generated by a control circuit (18) under control of the actual speed of the motor and which is supplied to the driving stages via circuits for galvanically separating the control circuit and the driving stages. The galvanic separation is brought about by means of light emitting diode/solar cell components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a circuit for controlling the speed of a one-phase or three-phase
motor.It is known from DE 3 409 299 to control the speed of a
three-phase motor by pulse width modulating the mains voltage
via transistor driving stages which are controlled by a
control circuit which is galvanically separated from the
driving stages. The driving stages are adapted for reversing
the phase to change the direction of rotation."Thyristor Control of A.C. Motors", JMD Murphy, Pergamon
Press, 1973, chapter 9.3, pages 154-158, shows an example of
a voltage controlled speed control of a three-phase induction
motor. The control is carried out by feedback of the actual
speed which is compared with a set value according to Fig.
9.6. Fig. 9.5 shows a circuit for phase reversal.From DE 2 700 296, the use of opto switches is known in
connection with the control of motors as well as the speed
control of an electric motor in dependency of the temperature
of a system component.JP 61-234620 describes a switching circuit comprising two
anti-parallel connected transistors each connected in series
with a blocking diode. The circuit is intended to control the
current between an a.c. source and a load.EP, A1, 381 094 shows a method of coupling phase voltage
to a three-phase motor. Switching of the phase voltage takes
place via bridge connected thyristors. The control of the
switching is accomplished by changing the turn-on angle for
the thyristors. Upon e.g. start of the motor the phase
voltage is clipped during parts of the period to obtain a
winding current which implies a softer start. Then, the turn-on
angle can successively be reduced in order to obtain the 
correct speed. The control signal to one of the two bridge
connected thyristors (per phase), is coupled optically.US, A, 3 866 097 describes a system to couple phase
voltage to a three-phase motor. The system differs from that
described in EP, A1, 381 094 in that the bridge connections
comprise a thyristor and a diode instead of two thyristors.US,A, 5 070 291 shows an alternative manner to provide a
three-phase motor with phase voltage. The motor is supplied
with a pseudo-three-phase which is generated by controlling
power transistors with pulse width modulated control signals.
Instead of coupling an available three-phase signal through,
a pseudo-three-phase signal is generated, which has a
constant amplitude but a variable frequency.US,A, 4 716 304 shows a further way of supplying a three-phase
motor with a pseudo-three-phase signal. In this
example,
