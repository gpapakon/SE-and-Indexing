<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an ignition coil which is most small in 
size without degrading performance under low primary current. 

The ignition coil includes an iron core (1) forming a closed 
magnetic circuit through an air gap (2), a primary winding (6) 

wound around the iron core (1) for magnetizing the iron core (1) 
and a permanent magnet (4) magnetized in an opposite direction 

to a magnetizing direction by the primary winding current. A 
cross-sectional area (SG) of the iron core (1) at which the 

permanent magnet (4) is inserted is made substantially equal to 
that (SM) of the permanent magnet (4). In order for the 

permanent magnet (4) to bias by 2/3 of the magnetic flux 
saturation point of the iron core (1), the permanent magnet (4) 

is so shaped that its thickness (LM) satisfies 0.6 mm

and its cross-sectional area (SM) and the cross-sectional area 

(SF) of winding portion of the iron core (1) satisfies

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method of operating
an improved ignition
coil mainly used for internal combustion engines for vehicles.Various kinds of ignition coils are known hitherto,
wherein a permanent magnet is inserted into an air gap portion
of an iron core in order to increase stored energy. Document EP-A-0 352 453 discloses an ignition coil, wherein
an iron core is provided with an air gap additionally having
a permanent magnet disposed in the air gap portion.
The cross-sectional area of the permanent magnet and the
cross-sectional area of a permanent magnet supporting portion
of the iron core are substantially equal (SM = SG). The
thickness of the permanent magnet inserted in the air gap
portion is between 0.6 - 1.8 mm, the ratio of the cross-sectional
area of the permanent magnet supporting portion SG
and the cross-sectional area of the iron core SF is between
1.5 and 4.5, and the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the permanent
magnet SM and the cross-sectional area of the iron core SF is
between 2 and 6. Prior to the energization of the primary
coil, the iron core is magnetized by a magnetizing force of
the permanent magnet inserted in the air gap portion in order
to reach a state of a maximum working magnetic flux density
in the negative direction which is opposite to the direction
of the magnetization to be caused by the energization of the
primary coil, in particular. According to this construction,
the permanent magnet biases the magnetization to the negative
saturation point of 1.5 T to obtain the maximum energy.
However, the secondary voltage will be reduced, when the
primary current is reduced below 3.5 A which is more likely,
when the primary winding resistance is higher than 1 Ohm. In
this case, the output voltage of an ignition coil having a
permanent magnet is clearly less than that of an ignition
coil not being equipped with a permanent magnet, specifically
in a primary current range lower than 3 A. Due to the
corresponding magnetic saturation, this results in an output
performance degradation. Fig. 6 is
a schematic view showing a fundamental magnetic circuit of an
iron core which has a permanent magnet inserted into an air gap
portion of an ignition coil
according to the above European Patent Application.
In a magnetic circuit shown in
Fig. 6, reference mark SF is a cross-sectional area of the iron
core through which magnetic flux Φ flows, SG is a cross-sectional
area of a permanent magnet supporting portion of the iron core,
