Multi-pole vacuum switch (1) with the following 
features: 


one vacuum interrupter (10) per pole, 
each vacuum interrupter (10) has an essentially 
cylindrical housing (11) and cylindrically shaped 

end flanges (12, 13) which terminate the said housing 
(11) axially, and a connection bolt (15) which 

extends through one end flange (12) and is mounted 
so as to be displaceable for the purpose of switching 

on and off, 
each of the vacuum interrupters (10) is surrounded 
by an insulating arrangement (23), 
the insulating arrangements (23) of all the poles 
are arranged one next to the other and contain a 

connection chamber (31) which is arranged in the 
axial extent of the assigned vacuum interrupter (10) 

and into which the displaceable connection bolt (15) 
of the vacuum interrupter (10) projects, 
the connection chamber (31) contains a loop-shaped, 
flexible connector (17) for connecting the 

displaceable connection bolt (15) to an outer connection 
element (20), 
a drive device (6), common to all the poles, for 
switching on and off the vacuum interrupters (10) of 

all the poles, 
in each case a drive lever (51) for each of the 
vacuum interrupters (10) which is pivotably mounted 

in the assigned insulating arrangement (23), 
 
characterized by the following further features:  

 

each insulating arrangement (23) comprises two 
shell-like insulating elements (21, 22) which 

receive the associated vacuum interrupter (10) 
between them and each have at least one recess (27, 

28) which is of approximately semicylindrical shape 
and is matched to one of the end flanges (12, 13) of 

the vacuum interrupter (10), 
the flexible connector (17) is arranged in the 
connection chamber (31) 
with legs (16, 18) which run 
transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis 

of the vacuum interrupter (10) in such a way that 
forces which arise as a result of a current flowing 

through the flexible connector (17) can be used to 
compensate contact repelling forces inside the 

vacuum interrupter (10), 
the insulating elements (21, 22) are each provided 
with at least two through-openings (54) for receiving 

clamping bolts (4) which penetrate all the 
insulating elements (21, 22), and 
a pole block (3) which is formed from the insulating 
arrangements (23) is arranged between side walls (5) 

which are constructed to protrude beyond the pole 
block (3) in order to attach the drive device (6). 
Vacuum switch according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the insulating elements (21, 22) are dimensioned 

so as to protrude beyond the associated vacuum 
interrupter (10), in that the protruding areas are 

bounded at least partially by wall sections (25, 26, 30, 
40, 32, 33) in order to form chambers (31, 37), and in 

that the shape of the chambers (27, 29, 31, 37, 42) is 
matched to electrical and mechanical components (17, 43) 

which are provided for the operation of the vacuum interrupter 
(10). 
Multi-pole vacuum switch according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that, adjacent to the connection chamber 

(31), a measuring chamber (37) which is intended for 
receiving a current converter (38) is arranged, which 

measuring chamber (37) is penetrated by the connection 
element (20) which extends as an extension of the  

 
longitudinal axis of the vacuum interrupter (10) or 

parallel thereto and is connected to one leg (18) of the 
flexible connector (17). 
Multi-pole vacuum switch according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the measuring chamber (37) is 

terminated by an insulating closure element (35) which is 
to be connected to the two insulating elements (21, 22) 

of an insulating arrangement (23) and has a drive-through 
opening for the associated connection element (20). 
Multi-pole vacuum switch according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the insulating arrangements (23) 

contain, to the side of the space intended for receiving 
the assigned vacuum interrupter (10), a spring chamber 

(24) for receiving at least one contact force spring (43) 
which provides the contact force of the vacuum interrupter 

(10) and, on the opposite side, a drive chamber 
(29) for receiving a lever arrangement (46, 50) which 

transmits the drive movement of the drive device (6) to 
the vacuum interrupter (10). 
Multi-pole vacuum switch according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that an undercut (41) for a bolt (44) 

which serves as a fixed counterbearing of the contact 
force spring (43) to lock into is arranged on a wall 

section (40) which bounds the spring chamber (24).
