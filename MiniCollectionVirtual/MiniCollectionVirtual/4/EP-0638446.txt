<ABSTRACT>
A tread for pneumatic vehicle tyres comprising a 
central row of tread blocks (3) extending in the 

circumferential direction of the tyre and rows of 
tread blocks (1,2) arranged in the shoulder regions 

of the tyre is described. The rows of blocks (1,2) 
arranged in the shoulder regions of the tyre are 

separated from the central row of tread blocks (3) 
by circumferential grooves (4,5). The edges of the 

tread blocks (6,7,12,14) which laterally border the 
circumferential grooves extend inclined relative to 

the central circumferential plane of the tyre. Wave-shaped 
sipes or knife-cuts (21,22,23) are provided 

in the tread blocks (6,7,10) with the tread blocks 
(6,7) of the rows of blocks (1,2) arranged in the 

shoulder regions of the tyre being more pronouncedly 
divided or split by sipes (21) than the tread blocks 

(10) of the central row blocks (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tread for 
pneumatic vehicle tyres comprising a central row of 
tread blocks extending in the circumferential 
direction of the tyre and row of tread blocks 
arranged in the shoulder regions of the tyre which 
are separated from the central row of tread blocks 
by circumferential grooves. Tread patterns of this kind are typically used in 
summer tyres. The lateral edges of the 
circumferential grooves are arranged parallel to the 
central circumferential plane. Since such tyre 
treads or patterns have been developed especially 
for summer use, the winter performance of a tyre 
equipped with such a profile is, in most cases, 
inadequate. A directional tread pattern of this kind having 
inclined circumferential grooves and corresponding 
to the preamble of claim 1 is known from DE-A-4300695. 
Tread patterns wherein only a portion of 
the circumferential groove is inclined to the 
circumferential plane are also known, for example 
from EP-A-477542 and DE-U-8809991.  
 The object of the invention is to provide a tread 
for pneumatic vehicle tyres of the initially named 
kind which has improved winter performance so that a 
tyre constructed in accordance with the invention 
can be used as an all-year tyre. According to the invention a tread for a pneumatic 
vehicle tyre comprises a central row of tread blocks 
extending in the circumferential direction of the 
tyre and rows of tread blocks arranged in the 
shoulder regions of the tyre which are separated 
from the central row of tread blocks by 
circumferential grooves, wherein the edges of the 
tread blocks which laterally border the 
circumferential grooves extend inclined relative to 
the central circumferential plane of the tyre, and 
wave-shaped sipes are provided in the tread blocks, 
characterised in that the tread blocks of the rows 
of blocks arranged in the shoulder regions of the 
tyre being more pronouncedly divided up by the sipes 
than the tread blocks of the central row of blocks, 
the lateral boundary edges of one circumferential 
groove extend substantially parallel to each other 
and also parallel to the lateral boundary edges of 
the other circumferential groove.  
 A zig-zag shaped course of the circumferential 
grooves is achieved by the edges of the tread blocks 
extending inclined whereby an improvement in the 
digging-in of the tread into snow (grip) and a 
better self-cleaning (snow clearing) is achieved. Through the use of wave-shaped sipes in all the 
tread blocks, the traction and braking action
