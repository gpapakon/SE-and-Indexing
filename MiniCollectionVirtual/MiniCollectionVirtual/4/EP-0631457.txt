<ABSTRACT>
A modular suite of peer-to-peer protocols that are independent of the 
communications network architecture supported, and the type of switching systems 

(packet-switched or circuit-switched), is used for a broadband and/or narrowband 
communications network. The protocols are comprised of client-server-oriented 

signaling messages that are restricted to include information and parameters 
associated with only one particular function of traditional call processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication systems. More specifically, 
this invention relates to signaling protocols for communications networks. Historically, communications switches were designed to manage and 
perform most, if not all, the functions associated with the completion of a telephone 
call. These functions include switching, routing, signaling, call controls and service 
controls. The development of digital, software-driven switches, allowed the 
signaling function to be decoupled from the other functions performed by a switch. 
Accordingly, protocols governing the format and the type of signaling information, 
were developed to a) allow communications between switches and b) manage the 
interface between a switch and a signaling node handling some of the signaling 
functions. Thus, these interfaces were limited to strictly network-specific functions 
and accordingly they became known in the art as "Network Node Interfaces" (NNI). 
The set of standardized protocols associated with the NNI type of interfaces is the 
Signaling System No. 7 (SS7). As customer premises equipment, such as Private Branch Exchanges 
(PBX) and telephone sets, started to use digital signals, as opposed to analog signals, 
to communicate with switches, protocols were also needed to manage the 
communications interfaces between users' equipments and switches. Accordingly, 
protocols were also developed to standardize user-network access procedures or, 
more specifically, the interfaces between the customer premises equipment and the 
switches of a telephone network. Those interfaces became to be known in the art as 
"User-Network Interfaces" (UNI). Associated with the UNI interfaces is a 
standardized set of protocols known as "Digital Subscriber Signaling System No. 1" 
(DSS1). With the introduction of Narrowband Integrated Services Digital 
Network (N-ISDN) and the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model which 
defined user-network access and network-to-network (or switch-to-switch) standards 
for voice and data communications, UNI and NNI were adapted to conform to these 
new standards. NNI protocols were further extended to standardize communications 
procedures between switches and service-specific database systems that provide, for 
example, call related information look-up functions for services, such as Freephone, 
known in the United States as 800 Service. The subset of the NNI protocol suite  
 
related to communications between switching nodes and service-specific processors 
in a network is known as

<CLAIMS>
A modular suite of peer-to-peer protocols for use in communications 
between entities of broadband and narrowband communications networks, 

comprising 
   at least one client-server-oriented signaling message a) comprising an 

operation and one or more parameters and representing a call processing function 
that is selected from a group of functions consisting of call control function, channel 

control function, and connection control function; the message being independent of 
communications network architecture and of switching systems used in the 

architecture. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein signaling messages conforming to 
the protocols are defined to a) perform service control call processing function 

independently of the call control, channel control and connection control functions 
b) facilitate communications between a service-specific server providing a particular 

communications service, and an entity of the network. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein said call control function includes 
the operations of a) service invocation and coordination when multiple services are 

invoked in a call, b) user-to-user and user-to-server negotiation of resources, c) 
recognition of needs for special resources which include protocol converters and 

multimedia bridges, d) maintenance of call state and configuration information and 
e) management of ownership and permissions for calls. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein said channel control function 
includes the operations of a) allocation of resources on a link by link basis to 

implement a connection, and b) maintenance of Virtual Channel Identifier translation 
table entries to interconnect channels that are part of a connection. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein said connection control function 
comprises the operations of a) establishing, releasing, and modifying connections 

within a call, and b) computing end-to-end quality-of-service measurements.
