<ABSTRACT>
Ground fault trip units for circuit breakers are tested by a passive test 
circuit which includes a test conductor passing through the current transformer 

sensing coil(s), and a test switch which selectively connects the test conductor in a 
loop which simulates a neutral-to-ground fault. In a dormant oscillator ground fault 

test circuit, the test conductor loop passes through both sensing coils. When the 
neutral-to-ground detector is combined with a sputtering arc fault detector sharing 

a common sensing coil, testing of all the components is accomplished by adding an 
additional test circuit which injects pulses derived from the line conductor into the 

sensing coil secondary, or which alternatively, connects a capacitor charged from 
a DC supply across the sensing coil secondary. Either of these alternative test 

circuits generates the successive events needed to produce a sputtering arc trip.

<DESCRIPTION>
Tins invention relates to electronic trip units for circuit breakers, and 
more particularly to such trip units which respond to ground faults and sputtering 
arc faults, and incorporate test circuits for fully testing these features. Conventional residential and light industrial and commercial circuit 
breakers have a thermal trip device which responds to persistent overcurrents of 
moderate magnitude to provide a delayed trip, and a magnetic trip device which 
responds instantaneously to overcurrents of large magnitudes. Thus, the fault 
current must reach a pre-determined magnitude, for example, ten times rated current 
for the instantaneous trip to occur, or the overcurrent must sustain a predetermined 
average value over a given time interval to implement the delayed trip. Recently, it has become common to incorporate ground fault trip units 
into such circuit breakers. The ground fault trip unit detects faults between the line 
conductor and ground and the neutral conductor and ground. Line-to-ground faults 
are commonly detected by a differential transformer in the form of a toroidal coil. 
The line and neutral conductors are passed through the coil so that in the absence 
of a line-to-ground fault, the currents are dual and opposite and no signal is 
generated in the secondary. A line-to-ground fault causes a sizeable imbalance in 
the currents in the two conductors which can be level detected. The neutral 
conductor is required by code to he grounded near the circuit breaker. Thus, a 
neutral-to-ground fault in the protected system closes a loop between the neutral 
conductor and ground. Typically, neutral-to-ground faults are detected by injecting  
 
a signal onto the neutral conductor which produces an oscillation if feedback is 
provided through the loop completed by the neutral-to-ground fault. A common type of ground fault detector is the dormant oscillator 
circuit. This ground fault circuit includes two sensing coils. The first serves as a 
differential transformer which detects line-to-ground faults. A neutral-to-ground 
fault couples the two coils to provide feedback which causes an operational amplifier 
to oscillate. It is common for ground fault circuit breakers to incorporate test 
circuits for testing the line-to-ground fault portion of the circuit. Typically, this 
includes a test lead which passes through the differential transformer coil and is 
selectively connected by a switch across the line and neutral conductors. To our 
knowledge, no arrangement is currently provided for
