<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electric motor vehicle
using a motor as a drive motive power, and particularly to
an electric motor vehicle which is preferably applied to two
wheelers and three wheelers such as motorcycles and
scooters.GB-A- 2 059 177 discloses a vehicle generator having a housing according to the preamble of claim 1.It is now said to be an age of electric motor vehicles.
It is said that the electric motor vehicles will solve most
of the environmental issues such as the exhaust gas from
automobiles which is said to make up about 70% of air
pollution, noises, or the like, and will extend the life of
oil resources by two times or more.Known electric motor vehicles are provided as their
drive system with a battery, a motor, and a controller for
controlling the speed of the motor, and a wheel is rotated
by a drive transmission mechanism like conventional
automobiles, or a wheel is rotated by a motor disposed on it
without necessitating such a drive transmission mechanism
like conventional automobiles. And, in developing an
electric motor vehicle, the improvement of the performance
of an onboard battery is an issue to be solved and it will
not be long before it is solved. Incidentally, the electric motor vehicle is also
demanded to have its safety improved together with the
improvement of its performance. A mere replacement of the
drive motive power of a conventional gasoline automobile by
a motor can not sufficiently provide the safety of the
electric motor vehicle. Specifically, the electric motor
vehicle uses electricity for a drive source, and the power
is a motor which rotates at a high speed as compared with an
engine. Therefore, a trouble of the electric system or a
failure of the motor may suddenly stop a running vehicle.These troubles or the necessity of
protection is caused due to the device or structure peculiar
in the electric motor vehicle, which is not seen in
conventional automobiles.The inventors involved in the development of an
electric motor vehicle propose the following point to
prevent accidents or failures form occurring and to assure
safety.Point for safety: To avoid a travel motion
trouble of the electric motor vehicle which may suddenly 
occur when travelling, for example, a sudden stop of the
electric motor vehicle.When the vehicle is exposed to wind and rain and
suffers from vibration when travelling, water may enter the
motor or the electric control circuit, causing an insulation
failure (electrical short). This is very dangerous because
it leads to a stop of the

<CLAIMS>
An electric motor vehicle (1) having as the drive system
a battery (7), a motor (6), and a controller (8) for

controlling the rotation of the motor (6), said motor (6)
comprising a motor case (11) and a motor cover (12), said

motor case (11) having a hollow section (11c) in which a
stator (13) is disposed, said motor cover (12) being fixed to

one end of said motor case (11), said motor cover (12) having
a ring-shaped projection (12a) that fits within the hollow

section (11c) of the motor case (11) such that a leading end
of said ring-shaped projection presses an end face of said

stator (13) to fix said stator (13) between said motor case
(11) and said motor cover (12) and such that an outer

periphery of said projection (12a) covers the space between
said motor case (11) and said motor cover (12) from the inside,
characterized in that

the space between said motor case (11) and said motor cover
(12) is sealed by a filler made of a liquid packing.
An electric motor vehicle according to claim 1, wherein
the end of said motor case (11) opposite to the end fixed to

said motor cover (12) is fixed to one end of a case (10) for
accommodating a power transmission mechanism (9) and a

coupling section of said motor case (11) and said case (10)
for accommodating the power transmission mechanism (9) is

sealed by a sealant excepting passages for a motor output
shaft (6a) and a motor wiring (6b, 6c). 
An electric motor vehicle according to claim 2, wherein
the motor wiring (6b, 6c) is once pulled out in the same

direction as the motor output shaft (6a), passed through a
closed chamber (10b) which is formed by connecting the motor

transmission mechanism (9) and pulled outside through the

contact section of the closed chamber (10b).
