<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel ligands and labelling techniques. The present invention further relates to a diagnostic composition suitable for administration to a warm-blooded animal comprising somatostatin or hirudin or a molecule capable of interacting with the somatostatin receptor or with the hirudin receptor labeled with a radionuclide by means of a chelate ligand capable of administration to an animal to produce reliable visual imaging of tumors or therapeutic effects on tumors and blood clots.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to novel ligands and
compounds for use in diagnostic tissue imaging and more
particularly, to site specific radiolabelled peptides, to
novel ligands for preparing radiolabelled compositions, to
methods of preparing such site specific radiolabelled
peptides, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising
these site specific radiolabelled peptides for diagnostic
imaging or therapeutic use.Scintigraphic imaging and similar radiographic
techniques for visualizing tissues invivo are finding
ever-increasing application in biological and medical
research and in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
Generally, scintigraphic procedures involve the preparation
of radioactive agents which, upon introduction to a
biological subject, become localized in the specific organ,
tissue or skeletal structure of choice. When so localized,
traces, plots or scintiphotos depicting the invivo
distribution of radiographic material can be made by
various radiation detectors, e.g., traversing scanners and
scintillation cameras. The distribution and corresponding
relative intensity of the detected radioactive material not
only indicates the space occupied by the targeted tissue,
but also indicates a presence of receptors, antigens,
aberrations, pathological conditions, and the like.In general, depending on the type of radionuclide and
the target organ or tissue of interest, the compositions
comprise a radionuclide, a carrier agent designed to target
the specific organ or tissue site, various auxiliary agents
which affix the radionuclide to the carrier, water or other 
delivery vehicles suitable for injection into, or
aspiration by, the patient, such as physiological buffers,
salts, and the like. The carrier agent, i.e. ligand,
attaches or complexes the radionuclide to the peptide
carrier agent, which results in localizing the radionuclide
being deposited in the location where the carrier agent
concentrates in the biological subject.Technetium-99m(99mTc) is a radionuclide which is widely
known for its uses in tissue imaging agents. Due to its
safety and ideal imaging properties, this radionuclide is
conveniently available commercially in the oxidized
pertechnetate form (99mTcO4-) hereinafter "pertechnetate-Tc99m".
However, pertechnetate will not complex with the
most commonly used biological carriers for radionuclide
tissue imaging. Thus, technetium-labelled imaging agents
are generally prepared by admixing a pertechnetate-Tc99m
isotonic saline solution, a technetium reductant (reducing
agent) such
