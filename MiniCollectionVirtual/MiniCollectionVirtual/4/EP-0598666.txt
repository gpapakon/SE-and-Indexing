<ABSTRACT>
The tape cassette reel lock mechanism locks a pair of tape reels (6,6') against 
rotation the a tape cassette to prevent a tape wound around the tape reels from 

being loosened. The mechanism has a rcel lock assembly (1) movable between a 
lock position to lock the tape rccls against rotation and an unlock position to 

unlock the tape reels for rotation. The reel lock assembly includes a slider (12) 
supported in the tape cassette, a lock body (13) having a pair of engaging members 

(20,20') engageable with teeth (8) on outer circumferential edges of the tape reels, 
and a twistable joint (14), the slider and the lock body being integrally to each 

other by the twistable joint. When one of the tape reels is turned in a direction to 
loosen the tape, one of the engaging members is displaced by one of the teeth on 

the one of the tape reels, twisting the joint to prcss the other engaging member 
against one of the teeth on the other tape reel for thereby turning the other tape reel 

in a direction to tension the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape cassette having a reel lock mechanism
and more particularly to a tape cassette having a reel lock mechanism capable of
reliably preventing a tape from becoming loose or slack in a tape cassette.Magnetic tape cassettes for use in video tape recorders (VTRs) or the like have
a reel lock mechanism for preventing the magnetic tape from becoming loose or
slack when not in use.FIG. 7 of the accompanying drawings shows one such reel lock mechanism a.As shown in FIG. 7, a lower tape cassette member b supports a pair of tape
supply and takeup reels with a magnetic tape d wound thereon, the tape supply and
takeup reels having respective lower flanges c, c'. The lower flanges c, c' have
series of teeth e, e', respectively, on their outer circumferential edges.The reel lock mechanism a, which is incorporated in the lower tape cassette
member b, has a reel lock assembly f positioned substantially between the tape
supply and takeup reels. The reel lock assembly f comprises a main body g and a
pair of lock fingers h, h' projecting from the main body g. The reel lock assembly f
is normally urged in the direction indicated by the arrow A by a spring (not
shown).The lock fingers h, h' are made of a resilient material. The reel lock assembly
f is urged in the direction A to keep the lock fingers h, h' in engagement with the
respective teeth e, e' to lock the tape supply and takeup reels against rotation in one
direction. More specifically, the lock fingers h, h' allow the flanges c, c' to rotate
in the respective directions indicated by the arrows B, B', i.e., in the directions to
keep the magnetic tape d under tension, but prevent the flanges c, c' from rotating
in the opposite directions to cause the magnetic tape d to become loose or slack.When a force indicated by the arrow F in FIG. 8 of the accompanying
drawings is applied to the supply reel flange c due to vibration or the like, the reel
lock assembly f is displaced in the direction indicated by the arrow C, bringing the
lock finger h' out of engagement with the teeth e' of the takeup reel flange c'. Since
the tape takeup reel can now rotate in the direction to permit the magnetic tape d to
become loose, the magnetic tape d tends to be loosened or slack, and can possibly
be jammed in the tape cassette. One solution is to employ a pair of lock fingers i, i' having respective notches
j, j', as shown in FIG. 9 of the accompanying drawings. When the force F is
imposed on the supply reel flange c, the lock finger i is bent at the

<CLAIMS>
A tape cassette comprising a housing portion (3) having a bottom wall (3a),
a pair of tape reels (4, 4') mounted on the bottom wall of the housing, and a reel

lock mechanism (1) for locking said pair of tape reels against rotation to prevent a
tape (5) wound around the tape reels from being loosened, the reel lock mechanism

comprising a reel lock assembly (11) movable between a lock position to lock the
tape reels against rotation and an unlock position to unlock the tape reels for

rotation, and the reel lock assembly comprising a slider (12) slideably supported in
the tape cassette and having a cam surface engageable with an unlock member (27)

insertable through a hole (26) defined in the bottom wall of the cassette housing for
moving the reel lock assembly to said unlock position, a lock body (13) having a

pair of engaging members (20, 20') engageable with teeth (8) on outer
circumferential edges of the tape reels, and a twistable joint (14), said slider and

said lock body being integrally joined to each other by said twistable joint, the
arrangement being such that when one of the tape reels (4) is turned in a direction

to loosen the tape, one of said engaging members (20) is displaced by one of the
teeth (8) on said one of the tape reels, twisting said joint to press the other

engaging member (20') against one of the teeth (8') on the other tape reel (4') for
thereby turning the other tape reel in a direction to tension the tape;

characterized in that the bottom wall (3a) of the cassette housing has a
recessed portion (23), said hole (26) being provided through the bottom wall at the

recessed portion thereof and the slider (12) is arranged to slide on said recessed
portion of the bottom wall.
A tape cassette according to claim 1, wherein said recessed portion (23) of
the bottom wall of the cassette housing has an end (23a, 23'a) engageable with said

lock body (13) when said reel lock assembly (1) is displaced to said unlock
position, for releasing said engaging members (20, 20') from engagement with the

teeth (8, 8') on both of the tape reels (6, 6').
A tape cassette according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said twistable joint (14)
is joined to an upper end of said slider (12) remote from a bottom wall (3a) of the

tape cassette.
A tape cassette according to any previous claim, wherein said reel lock
assembly (1) includes a coil spring (25) acting on said slider (12) for normally

urging the slider in a direction toward said lock position. 
A tape cassette according to any previous claim, wherein said lock body
(13) comprises an intermediate portion (18) joined to said joint (14) at a front end

of said slider (12) and a pair of lock arms (19, 19') extending obliquely rearwardly
from said intermediate portion, said lock arms including respective upper portions

(19a, 19'a) and respective vertical portions (19b, 19'b) extending from the upper

portions, respectively, said engaging members (20, 20') comprising respective
vertical ridges projecting obliquely forwardly from said upper and vertical

portions.
A tape cassette according to claim 5, further including a pair of vertical
walls (22, 22') disposed on a bottom wall (3a) of the tape cassette (2) and lower

than said upper portions (19a, 19'a) of said lock arms (19, 19'), said slider (12)
being slidably guided by said vertical walls in said tape cassette.
