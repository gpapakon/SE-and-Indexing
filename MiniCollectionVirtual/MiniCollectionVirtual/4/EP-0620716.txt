<ABSTRACT>
An air system which reacts to pressure loading is integrated into the mattress. It consists of the pump body (1), the air reservoir (2), the airlines (7), the one-way valves (3), the manually adjustable pressure regulating valve (5) fitted with a scale (6) and the insulating air core (4). Maintenance of the pressure in the air core (4) is ensured in that the local pressure loading resulting from the use of the mattress forces air from the pump bodies (1) via the one-way valves (3) into the unloaded reservoir (2). This air which becomes compressed in the reservoir (2) remains as a reserve and equalises the pressure lost in the air core (4) by diffusion via the adjustable pressure regulating valve (5) fitted with a scale (6) and a rotary knob (15) to the requirement adjustable on the scale (6). The degree of support provided by mattresses made in this way can be adjusted from soft to hard. The mattress can thus be suited to the user's requirements in the best possible way. The air pressure in the air core (4) set on the scale (6) and hence the hardness of the mattress is maintained by the integrated air system solely in accordance with the load (use of the mattress) for an unlimited period of time. There is no need for pumping up manually or by other means.

Cushioning element for furniture for lying or sitting
on, having an integrated air system which reacts to load

and has an air core (4), 
characterized in that
 the air
system comprises an air reservoir (2), which is

connected to the air core (4) via a pressure-regulating
valve (5).
Cushioning element according to Claim 1, 
characterized
in that it
 comprises a pump system with a pump body (1),
which sucks in air via a first one-way valve (3) and is

connected to the air reservoir (2) via a second one-way
valve (3), and which is integrated in the cushioning

element in such a way that it is compressed by the load
produced when in use.
Cushioning element according to Claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 the pump body (1) is arranged in the peripheral
zone of the cushioning element.
Cushioning element according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the pump body (1) has a covering
made of elastic material, preferably air-tight film.
Cushioning element according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the pump body (1) contains air-permeable
foam.
Cushioning element according to one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 the pressure-regulating valve (5)
is continuously adjustable. 
Cushioning element according to Claim 6, 
characterized
in that
 the pressure-regulating valve (5) is provided
with a scale (6) and a regulating button (15).
Cushioning element according to Claim 7, 
characterized
in that
 the regulating button (15) is accessible via a
closable opening in a mattress covering.
Cushioning element according to one of Claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that
 the air core comprises a layer of
air-tight plastic film (12).
Cushioning element according to Claim 9, 
characterized
in that
 the plastic film (12) is homogenously joined to
an insulating material by flame lamination and is

additionally provided with a layer of fabric.
