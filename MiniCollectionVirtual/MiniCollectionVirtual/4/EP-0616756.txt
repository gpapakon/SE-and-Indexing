<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to photovoltaic devices and more particularly to a junction box for use with a flat photovoltaic solar panelThe increasing scarcity, and the realization of the ecological and safety problems associated with non-renewable energy reserves such as coal petroleum and uranium, have made it essential that increased use be made of alternate non-depletable energy resources such as photovoltaic energy. Photovoltaic energy use has been limited in the past to special application due in part to the high cost of manufacturing devices capable of producing significant amounts of photovoltaic energy. The development of a continuous process that continuously deposits successive layers of amorphous semiconductor alloy material on an elongated substrate to fabricate photovoltaic devices in mass production has greatly promoted the use of photovoltaic energy.One particular application in which photovoltaic devices have been found practical is in marine environments such as on piers and on non-motorized boats such as sailboats. In a typical marine application, a photovoltaic solar panel is utilized to recharge a battery on board the non-motorized boat. While the solar panel itself is typically manufactured with a plastic cover that makes the solar panel water and weather resistant, the junction between the electric cable for connection to the battery and the solar panel must also be made waterproof and structurally secure against pulling and other tension exerted on the electric cable. If the junction at the terminal is not waterproof the water may short out the solar panel and cause corrosion to proceed into the solar panel. It has been proposed to position the junction box beneath the solar panel to provide protection from the elements but this arrangement makes it impossible to mount the panel flat and flush against a boat surface.What is needed is a solar panel that can be used in a marine environment and which can be substantially flat, flush mounted on a suitable surface. More particularly, what is needed is a low profile junction box that is used to connect an electric cable to a solar panel to form a durable and waterproof connection between the electric cable and the solar panel.A junction box for a solar panel is known from FR-A-2 629 945 and from the German Gebrauchsmuster DE 8 803 635 U.This invention relates to a solar panel of the type including a power generating sheet that has an electrically conductive substrate and a plurality of layers of semi-conductive alloy material

<CLAIMS>
A junction box (36) for shielding the connection of an electric cable (20) to output terminals (30, 32) of a solar panel (27) positioned proximate an end edge portion of the solar panel (27), said junction box (36) comprising:

a first case member (44);
a frame member (40), having an enclosing border configuration (50), received within said first case member (44) and positioned against one face (34) of the edge portion of the solar panel (27) in overlying, surrounding relation to the output terminals (30, 32) of the solar panel (27), said frame member (40) being constructed to retain a water sealing potting material (62) which encases the end of the electric cable (20) connected to the output terminals (30, 32) of the solar panel (27) said frame member having a notch (52) in the side walls (50) defining its enclosing border to allow the electric cable to pass therethrough for connection to the output terminals (30, 32) of the solar panel (27);
an anchor plate (38) positioned against an opposite face (23) of the edge portion of the solar panel (27) and secured to said frame member (40);
a second case member (46) positioned against said opposite face (23) of the edge portion of the solar panel (27) and enclosing said anchor plate (38) therewithin, said second case member (46) being secured to said first case member (44) to clamp the edge portion of the solar panel (27) therebetween; and
means (79, 95; 88, 94; 80; 82) within said case members (44, 46) defining an electric cable passage extending from a location exteriorally of the junction box
 (36) to a location within said frame member (40) in overlying proximity to the terminals (30, 32).
A junction box (36) according to claim 1 wherein one of said first and second case members (44, 46) includes a tension relief device (80, 82) adapted to engage the electric cable (20) and operative to preclude tension exerted on the electric cable (20) exteriorally of the junction box (36) from being transferred to the end of the cable (20) connected to the terminals (30, 32).
A junction box (36) according to either of claims 1 or 2 wherein:

one of said frame member (40) and said anchor plate (38) has posts (54) that extend through the solar panel (27); and
the other of said frame member (40) and said anchor plate (38) has receptors (48) to receive said posts (54) and thereby lock said frame member (40) and said anchor plate (38) together with the solar panel (27) sandwiched therebetween.
A junction box (36) according to either of claims 1 or 2 wherein one of said first and second case members (44, 46) has posts (92) extending through the solar panel (27) and the other of said first and second case members (44, 46) has receptors (84, 86) to receive said posts (92) and thereby lock said first and second case members (44, 46) together with the solar panel (27) sandwiched therebetween.
A junction box (36) according to any preceding claim wherein said first and second case members (44, 46) are coactingly configured to define an aperture for passage of the electric cable (20) and are further coactingly configured to receive the end edge of the edge portion of the solar panel (27) therebetween.
A junction box (36) for connecting the output terminals (30, 32) of a solar panel (27) to an electric cable (20), said junction box (36) comprising:

an anchor plate (38) positionable on one side of the solar panel (27);
a frame member (40) having an enclosing border configuration (50) positionable on another side of the solar panel (27) in opposition to said anchor plate (38);
means (54, 48) for affixing said frame member (40) to said anchor plate (38) with said solar panel (27) sandwiched therebetween and with said frame member (40) positioned in surrounding relation to the output terminals (30, 32) of the solar panel (27);
said frame member (40) being constructed to retain a water sealing potting material (62) therebetween that is adapted to encase the end of an electric cable (20) connected to the output terminals (30, 32) of the solar panel (27); and
said frame member (40) having a passage (52) in the border (50) thereof to allow the electric cable (20) to pass therethrough for connection to the output terminals (30, 32) of the solar panel (27).
