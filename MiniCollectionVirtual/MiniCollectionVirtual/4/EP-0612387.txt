<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to valve systems for 
controlling the flow of gaseous or liquid fluids and 
particularly to the precise control valve systems which 
are required-in such fields as gas chromatography. In gas chromatography and other fields, it is 
necessary to control the flow of one or more fluids by 
means of a system of control valves. The configuration 
of the system may be quite complex, and the valves 
themselves are often required to be very small and precise 
in operation. To meet this requirement, the internal 
volume of the valves should be very small. Moreover, in many applications all surfaces which can 
come into contact with the controlled fluid must be inert 
so as to avoid contaminating the fluid. Substances which 
react with or absorb the controlled fluid can seriously 
distort the results of a gas chromatography system, for 
example, since the required sensitivity of those results 
may be of the order of a few parts per billion, or even 
less. It is also desirable that the operation of the valves 
be as simple as possible and that the valves have a long 
service life (i.e., numerous openings and closures) 
without failure. U.S. Patent No. 4,353,243 to Martin, issued October 
12, 1982, describes an arrangement in which a plurality of 
diaphragm valves are linked by a peripheral channel formed 
in the surface of a solid plate. While useful in some 
applications, this system does not have the flexibility of  
 
being adaptable to extremely complex arrays and 
interconnections between a large number of valves. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a fluid control valve arrangement comprising: a 
block having a plurality of holes extending from a first 
face of the block to a second face of the block; a 
membrane pressed against the first face of the block, the 
membrane having a plurality of blisters permanently 
formed therein, each blister having a convex side and a 
concave side; individual ones of the blisters being 
deformable by the creation of a pressure differential 
between the convex and concave sides thereof, the 
pressure on the convex side of the blister being greater 
than the pressure on the concave side of the blister when 
the blister is deformed, the arrangement being 
characterised in that the holes are formed in clusters, 
certain of the holes being linked by one or more grooves 
formed in the second face of the block, a sealing means 
providing a seal around the or each groove being 
positioned adjacent the second face of the block, the 
concave

<CLAIMS>
A fluid control valve arrangement comprising: 

a block (11; 33) having a plurality of holes (11a) 
extending from a first face of the block to a second face 

of the block; 
a membrane (12) pressed against the first face of 
the block, the membrane having a plurality of blisters 

(12a) permanently formed therein, each blister having a 
convex side and a concave side; 
individual ones of the blisters being deformable by 
the creation of a pressure differential between the 

convex and concave sides thereof, the pressure on the 
convex side of the blister being greater than the 

pressure on the concave side of the blister when the 
blister is deformed, the arrangement being characterised 

in that: 
the holes are formed in clusters, certain of the 
holes being linked by one or more grooves (11b,35) formed 

in the second face of the block, a sealing means (13,15) 
providing a seal around the or each groove being 

positioned adjacent the second face of the block, the 
concave side of each blister facing one of the hole 

clusters, a flow of fluid through the hole cluster 
associated with a blister being prevented when the 

blister is deformed. 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in 
claim 1 comprising a sealing plate (14) for pressing the 

membrane (12) against the first face of the block (11), 
the sealing plate including recesses (14a) which coincide 

with the respective locations of the blisters (12a) in 
the membrane (12). 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in 
claim 2 comprising means for selectively deforming 

individual ones of the blisters (12a). 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in  
 

claim 3 wherein the deforming means comprises means for 
selectively introducing a pressurized fluid into 

individual ones of the recesses. 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in 
claim 2, 3 or 4 wherein the sealing plate (14) contains a 

plurality of rings (14b), each of the rings surrounding 
one of the hole clusters. 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein the sealing means comprises a 

second sealing plate (15) pressed against the second face 
of the block (11). 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in 
claim 6 wherein the second sealing plate (15) contains 

ridges (15a) which surround individual ones of the 
grooves (11b). 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in 
claim 6 or 7 wherein the block (11), the membrane (12) 

and the second sealing plate (15) are made of an inert 
material. 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in any 
one of claims 1-5 wherein the sealing means comprises a 

second membrane (13) and a second sealing plate (15), the 
second sealing plate being positioned so as to press the 

second membrane against the second face of the block 
(11). 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in any 
one of claims 1-5 wherein the block (33) has at least one 

groove (31) in the first face thereof linking certain of 
the holes (11a) and comprising a second sealing means for 

providing a seal around the at least one groove in the 
first face of the block. 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in 
claim 10, wherein a second membrane (13) is pressed 

against the second face of the block, the second membrane 
having a plurality of the blisters (12a) with the concave  

 
side of each blister facing one of the hole clusters. 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in 
claim 11 wherein the first membrane (12) comprises the 

second sealing means and the second membrane (13) 
comprises the first sealing means. 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in 
claim 9, 11 or 12 wherein the block (11), the first 

membrane (12) and the second membrane (13) are made of an 
inert material. 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in 
claim 8 or 13 wherein the inert material is stainless 

steel, a nickel steel alloy, a chromium steel alloy, a 
nickel/ chromium steel alloy, a material coated with 

gold, or a material coated with a metal of the platinum 
group. 
A fluid control valve arrangement as claimed in any 
preceding claim comprising means (11c;33a) for allowing a 

controlled fluid to flow into at least one of the holes 
(11a) and means (11c) for allowing the controlled fluid 

to flow out of at least another one of the holes.
