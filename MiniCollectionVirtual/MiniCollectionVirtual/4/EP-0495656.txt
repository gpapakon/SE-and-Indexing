<ABSTRACT>
A retention device for holding a pair of co-acting 
components (1, 4) in a predetermined relationship has a 

first means (22) for rigid attachment to a first (1) of 
the components, and means (24) for releasable engagement 

with a rotatable adjuster element (12) associated with a 
second (4) of the components. With the device engaged 

with the first component, and with the second component 
via the adjuster element (12) the device retains the 

components in said relationship whilst permitting 
rotation of the adjuster element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an assembly comprising a pair of coacting 
components, such as a spring-loaded force transmission link and a 
load-conscious valve actuated, in use, by the link, and a retention device 
for retaining the components in a predetermined relationship. Devices such as load-conscious valves are often pre-set during 
manufacture and require to be retained in the pre-set state during storage 
and possible transport to a vehicle assembly location for assembly on to 
a vehicle. Existing measures for such retention include transit straps and 
similar devices applied to hold components in position, but these have 
not been found entirely satisfactory since they normally require to be 
removed prior to installation of the device, with a risk of disturbing the 
setting of the device unless additional careful precautions are taken. An object of the present invention is to provide an assembly 
incorporating a retention device which securely preserves the relative 
setting of components retained by the device, during storage and 
transport of the assembled components and until the components have 
been installed in their final positions of use. According to the invention, the retention device comprises a 
body having attachment means cooperating with attachment means on 
the second component so as to attach the device firmly to the second 
component, and engagement means, releasably engaged with the 
adjuster element so as to retain the latter relative to the first component 
whilst permitting rotary adjustment of the element.  
 In one practical form of the device, the attachment means of the 
body is a projection or socket adapted to interengage closely a 
complementary projection or socket respectively of the second 
component. The body preferably forms a slot, conveniently extending in 
general alignment with the projection or socket, part of the slot is large 
enough for the rotatable adjuster element, which is conveniently a nut, 
to pass therethrough in a first direction which is conveniently generally 
perpendicular to said projection or socket, and part of the slot is of 
restricted width and has edge portions forming the engagement means so 
as to be brought within a lateral groove of the adjuster element when the 
device is moved longitudinally to bring the projection and socket into 
interengagement following passage of the adjuster element through the 
slot. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with 
reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-

<CLAIMS>
An assembly comprising a pair of co-acting components, a first 
(4) of which carries a rotary adjuster element (12), characterised by a 

retention device (20) in the form of a body (21, 31) having attachment 
means (22, 38) cooperating with attachment means (1A) on the second 

component (1) so as to attach the device firmly to the second 
component, and engagement means (23A, 34A), releasably engaged with 

the adjuster element so as to retain the latter relative to the first 
component whilst permitting rotary adjustment of the element. 
An assembly according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
attachment means of the body is a projection or socket (22, 38) adapted 

to interengage closely a complementary socket (1A) or spigot respectively 
of the second component (1). 
An assembly according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
body (21, 31) forms a slot (25, 35), a part (27, 36) of which is large 

enough for the rotatable adjuster element (12) to pass therethrough, and 
a part (25, 37) of which is of restricted width and of which the edge 

portions (23A, 34A) form the engagement means, being brought within a 
lateral groove (12A) of the adjuster element when the device is moved 

longitudinally to bring the projection and socket into interengagement 
following passage of the adjuster element through the slot. 
An assembly according to Claim 3, characterised in that the slot 
(25, 37) extends in general alignment with the projection or socket (22, 

38).  
 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the body (21) is generally U-shaped with the arms 

(21A, 21B) thereof interconnected by a web (23) which extends beyond 
the free ends of the arms and carries a tongue (28) for cooperation with a 

detector beam device. 
An assembly according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the body (31) is generally U-shaped with the arms 

(32, 33) interconnected by a web (34) which extends beyond the free 
ends of the arms and carries a pair of oppositely extending arms (40) for 

cooperation with a detector beam device. 
An assembly according to Claim 5 or Claim 6, characterised in 
that the web (23, 34) is offset widthwise of the body (2) so as to be 

asymmetrically disposed in this direction.
