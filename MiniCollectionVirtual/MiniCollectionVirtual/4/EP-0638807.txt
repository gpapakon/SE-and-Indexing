<ABSTRACT>
Improved homogenous diagnostic assay methods and 
labels for detecting an analyte in a medium when the 

analyte is a member of a specific binding pair. The 
methods and labels provide procedures for reducing 

background and increasing sensitivity. The binding 
partner of the analyte is labeled with a substance, the 

stability of which detectably changes whenever said 
analyte is bound as a member of the specific binding 

pair. In a closely related system, the analyte is 

labeled with a substance susceptible to differential 
degradation depending on whether or not the analyte is 

bound as a member of its specific binding pair. After 
incubation and selective degradation or chemical or 

biochemical alteration, the amount of analyte bound is 
detected by measuring either the stability change or the 

extent of degradation of the label. In a particular 
system, chemiluminescent acridinium ester labeled probes 

are used in a homogenous hybridization assay format for 
sensitively detecting the presence of complement any 

target polynucleotide sequences.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the art of diagnostic
procedures and techniques for detecting and quantitating
minute amounts of organic compounds.More particularly, this invention relates to
homogeneous diagnostic assays in which there is a difference
in the stability of the label in its bound, as
opposed to its unbound forms. This invention relates to
the construction of environments for diagnostic assay
systems in which a label is differentially degraded in
either its complexed or bound form as compared to its
uncomplexed or unbound form.Diagnostic assays are a common analytical technique
for detecting, locating or quantifying biological substances
by employing labelled binding reagents. The presence
of the labeled reagent can then be detected using a
variety of known methods. This invention can be applied
to all known diagnostic assay formats, including, without
limitation, direct binding and competition assays and
sequential saturation. One particular type of diagnostic
assay is the nucleic acid hybridization assay. Hybridization
assay systems are based on the fact that single
stranded nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) will hybridize or
recombine, under appropriate circumstances, with complementary
single stranded nucleic acids. By labelling the
complementary probe nucleic acid with a readily detectable
label, it is possible to detect the presence of the 
target polynucleotide sequence of interest in a test
sample containing single stranded nucleic acid sequences.Assay systems may broadly be characterized as
heterogeneous or homogeneous. The term "heterogeneous"
as applied to assay systems means those specific binding
assays which require a separation of the labelled from
unlabeled substance to be detected. Homogeneous assays
systems, on the other hand, do not involve any physical
separation steps. Because homogeneous assay systems
involve a minimum number of handling steps they are
generally more convenient and easier to use than heterogeneous
assay systems.For example, a typical sandwich immunoassay may
involve incubating an immobilized antibody with a test
medium. Antigens, if in the medium, will bind to the
antibody. After incubation, unbound antigen is removed
in a separation step. After a second, or simultaneous
incubation with a solution of labeled antibody, the bound
antigen becomes "sandwiched" between the immobilized
antibody and the labelled antibody. After a second
separation step, the amount of labeled antibody can be
determined as a measure of the antigen in the medium.
This system is time consuming
