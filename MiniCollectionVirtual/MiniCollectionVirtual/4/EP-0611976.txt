refracting power on the whole and constructed of, in order 
from an object side, a first lens unit having a negative 

refracting power, a second lens unit having a positive 
refracting power, a third lens unit having the negative

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a finder for use
with a lens shutter camera.A Keplerian finder is constructed of an objective
lens group having a positive refracting power and an
eyepiece having a positive refracting power. In the
Keplerian finder, a field frame or a reticle plate is
arranged in the vicinity of a focal position of the
objective lens group. With this arrangement, it is
possible to clearly view a demarcator between visual
fields and a variety of indications. The Keplerian finder
is therefore adopted as a finder of a high-quality lens
shutter. Further, in this Keplerian finder, an entrance
pupil thereof exists inwardly of the finder or on an
object side of the finder. Hence, a lens aperture of the
objective lens group does not increase even when
continuously varying a magnification of the finder or
attaining a much wider angle of the finder. From this
advantage, the Keplerian finder is broadly employed
especially as a zoom finder. While on the other hand,
the Keplerian finder exhibits the following defects. The
Keplerian finder is constructed to view a real image
formed by the objective lens group and the field frame or 
the reticle plate in enlargement through the eyepiece.
Consequently, this leads to such a drawback that internal
defects, flaws and dusts on the surface of the prism or
the lens close to the reticle plate as well as those on
the reticle plate are easy to become conspicuous. It can
not be overlooked that this defect hinders a spread of the
Keplerian finder.The applicant identical with that of the present
invention proposed an apparatus for solving the above
problem of the foreign matters being seen inside the
finder in U.S. Serial No. 044,600 filed on April 9, 1993.
According to this proposal, an objective lens group closer
to an object than a reticle plate is of a
negative/positive/positive type. Widened are an air
spacing between the reticle plate and a third lens unit
and an air spacing between the reticle plate and an
eyepiece. There was made an attempt to obviate the
problem by taking this arrangement and satisfying various
conditions. Then, according to this proposal, in a finder
having a variable power ratio on the order of 2, down-sizing
of the finder can be attained with a small number
of lenses. In the case of increasing the variable power
ratio, particularly if the variable power ratio exceeds
2.5, however, moving quantities of first and second lens
units sharply increase with the above-mentioned
arrangement. Besides, an aperture of each lens becomes
large, and,
