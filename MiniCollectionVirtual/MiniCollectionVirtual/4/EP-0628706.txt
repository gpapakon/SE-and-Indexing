<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates to exhaust gas treatment systems in general 
and, more particularly, to catalytic techniques for substantially reducing noxious exhaust 
components generated by diesel engines. It has been widely recognized that exhaust emissions from internal 
combustion engines are directly hazardous to the health of living organisms and to the 
environment. As a result, diesel engine emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 
particulates from diesel engines, which traditionally have been afforded more lenient 
treatment than Otto cycle engines, are increasingly being regulated by governmental 
agencies. Accordingly, various techniques are under active consideration to reduce 
noxious emissions emanating from these engines. Concepts include engine modifications 
and improvements, alternate and reformulated fuels (i.e., hydrogen), and exhaust after 
treatment devices such as traps, catalyzed traps and catalytic converters.  Unfortunately, engines modified or improved to reduce NOx emissions 
usually have increased particulate emissions. On the contrary, methods for reducing 
particulates generally increase NOx emissions. Surveys of the art appear to reflect that most of the work has been 
concentrated on the reduction of particulate emissions. This avenue of attack includes 
filter traps, catalytic and fuel additive systems designed to reduce fast ignition temperature 
and regeneration. On the other hand, work on NOx reduction from diesel engines has 
been somewhat limited. It is surmised that this difficult problem has been exacerbated by 
high oxygen levels in the exhaust stream. With the introduction of new and tighter 
standards scheduled to become effective in the near future, NOx reduction in diesel 
exhausts will require new catalytic systems capable of functioning effectively in high 
oxygen atmospheres. Though a number of stationary systems have been successfully 
commissioned, no similar systems appear to exist in the transportation sector. The 
catalytic reduction of NOx by NH₃ (ammonia) over a copper catalyst has been effectively 
demonstrated where fossil fuels are used to heat boilers, reactors, etc. It is not applicable 
to vehicles mainly because of the potential hazard posed by the on board storage of NH₃, 
and to a lesser extent, because of the effects of low NH₃ vapor pressures on the highly 
controlled delivery system required to match the rapid variations in NOx content during 
operation. In the laboratory, tests suggested that Cu and NH₃ incorporated into zeolite 
resins

A process for the treatment of diesel engine exhaust gases, the process including 
contacting the gas with a silver catalyst deposited on a nickel foam substrate (16) in the 

 
presence of a reducing agent at a temperature of about 200°C to about 600°C and
