<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nebulizer apparatus according 
to the preamble of claim 1. It is a known fact that, in the specific field of 
application of this invention, there exists a need for 
supplying patients or invalids subjected to such therapy 
with an oxygen/air mixture enriched with a water mist. The finely divided water ensures, in fact, proper 
humidity of the mixture being inhaled by the patient. It is also very important that the mixture be supplied 
under aseptic conditions, to prevent formation of 
bacterial growths that could be delivered to the patient, 
already in a weakened state of health, and generate new 
pathologies. To meet this demand, the prior art has proposed the use 
of nebulizers connected to sterile water containers from 
which they draw through a Venturi pipe arrangement.  
 Such prior apparatus, while being widely employed, are not 
devoid of disadvantages, and fall short of fully meeting 
the above-outlined requirements. In the first place, the air drawn in directly from the 
environment, through the Venturi arrangement, may itself be 
a source of bacterial load and, since bacterial and viral 
elements are used to grow at a fast rate in a medium having 
a high moisture content, it appears that prior art 
nebulizers can hardly be regarded as really aseptic. Further, the use of containers or bottles of sterile water 
is definitely cost-intensive. In fact, this class of 
products for medical applications have such specific 
features that make them significantly expensive and 
certainly not universally available items. A known solution is disclosed in the U.S. patent No. 
4,128,407 which reletes to a nebulizer apparatus according 
to the preamble of the enclosed claim 1. Such an apparatus includes a several layer filter pad 
protecting against bacteria the flow path downstream from 
the nebulizer. A second solution is disclosed in the U.S. patent No. 
3,929,128 relating to a nebulizer apparatus using a PTFE 
filter plug. This filter apparatus prevents liquid, water and bacteria 
from passing. However, this solution requires anyway the 
use of sterile water. A futher document, the U.S. patent No. 3,782,083, relates 
to a synthetic plastic material filter which however 
doesn't allow the passage of water vapor. The underlying technical problem of this invention is to  
 
provide a nebulizer apparatus for oxygen therapy which such 
features as to obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks with 
which the prior art is beset. The solutive idea of this invention is to provide 
an

<CLAIMS>
A nebulizer apparatus (1) for high-humidity oxygen 
therapy comprising a sealed container (2) for containing 

water (18) for nebulization, a nebulizer (9) drawing from the 
container (2) and being in fluid communication with a supply of 

a gaseous mixture, and an anti-bacterial filter (14) 
installed in a delivery conduit (7) in the flow path of 

said humidified mixture downstream from the nebulizer (9), 
characterized in that said anti-bacterial filter (14) 

comprises a hydrophobic, water repellant and bacteria 
repellant membrane (21) of microporous PTFE formed by a 

very fine fibrils structure which allows the passage of an 
effective flow of humid air while preventing the passage of 

aerosol particles in said delivery conduit thereby allowing 
the use of non-sterile water in the nebulizer. 
A nebulizer apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said membrane (21) is formed from a 

thin sheet of a synthetic microporous PTFE plastics material 
having a smaller pore size than 0.01 millimetres. 
A nebulizer apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said filter (14) is housed within a 

case (11) which fits removably in the delivery conduit (7) 
by means of a quick-connect arrangement. 
A nebulizer apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said container is closed by a cover 

and the anti-bacterial filter (14) is attached to said 
cover (3) providing a barrier between the nebulizer (9) and 

the delivery conduit (7).
