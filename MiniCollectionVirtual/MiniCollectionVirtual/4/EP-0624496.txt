<ABSTRACT>
The anti-theft system uses an IR light transmitter and a magnetic field sensor incorporated in a closure element and an IR receiver, and a magnetic field transmitter incorporated in a locking element. Pref. the cooperating magnetic field transmitter and magnetic field sensor are used for transmission of energy and data pref. simultaneously, via an inductive transmission path between the locking element and the closure element.

<CLAIMS>
Electronic anti-theft system for motor vehicles, 
having a closing element which has an infrared light 

transmitter and a magnetic field receiver and having a 
locking element which has an infrared light receiver and 

a magnetic field transmitter. 
Electronic anti-theft system according to Claim 
1, in which both data and energy can be transmitted from 

the magnetic field transmitter to the magnetic field 
receiver. 
Electronic anti-theft system according to Claim 
2, in which data and energy can be transmitted simultaneously 

from the magnetic field transmitter to the 
magnetic field receiver.
