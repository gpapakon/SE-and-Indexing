<ABSTRACT>
Skin cosmetics containing a titanium oxide powder which 
contains iron oxide. Thus a skin cosmetics contains fine 

composite oxides with an average particle size between 5 
and 100 nm consisting or titanium oxide and iron oxide 

obtained by flame hydrolysis or the skin cosmetics contain 
a titanium oxide which is covered by an iron oxide obtained 

by a hydrolysis reaction of an iron halide on the surface 
of the titanium oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to skin cosmetics such as, for 
example, solidified cosmetics, emulsified cosmetics and 
sunscreening cosmetics, which contain new fine composite 
oxides. As well known, titanium oxide (with an average particle 
size of 0.1 Âµm or less) is effective for shielding UV-ray 
and thus capable of providing cosmetics with a sun-screening 
effect (JP-PS 49-000450 and JP-PS 47-42502). However, it is not dispersed homogeneously in cosmetics due 
to strong aggregation caused by its fineness. As a result 
of this, cosmetics containing it show poor extensibility 
and some stiffness (not smooth but rough feeling with poor 
adhesion) on the skin. Besides, such cosmetics emphasize 
whiteness unnaturally and have a strong tendency to show 
dull tone (dark and unpleasant color) after make-up. For 
these reasons, it is not possible to add fine titanium 
oxide to a sufficient extent. It is also known to formulate cosmetics with iron oxide. 
They show different dispersibility in the cosmetics in 
accordance with their type. Especially, red iron oxide and 
black iron oxide are inferior in dispersibility. 
Therefore, cosmetics containing these oxides have shown 
deficiencies like the appearance of coarse pigment 
particles or the destruction of other powders in cosmetics 
after a long mixing process during production. The subject of the invention are skin cosmetics containing fine 
composite oxides composed of titanium oxide obtained by flame 
hydrolysis and iron oxide 
obtained by flame hydrolysis 
with an average particle size of 5 to 100 nm  
 
The inventors examined fine oxide particles for cosmetics 
considering such deficiencies as mentiond above and have 
persued the matter of this invention by finding the fact 
that fine composite oxides consisting of titanium oxide and 
iron oxide obtained by flame hydrolysis show, when added to 
cosmetics, a remarkably good capability of improving its 
UV-ray shielding effect in comparison with conventional 
fine tianium oxide particles to achieve cosmetic products 
ensuring complexionlike coloring without emphasizing 
whiteness unnaturally and causing a dull tone after make-up. The purpose of this invention is to provide skin cosmetics 
with excellent UV-ray shielding effect which show superior 
extensibility and adhesiveness when applied to skin and 
ensure a transparent complexion, free from dull tone, and 
without causing unnatural emphasis of whiteness like 
titanium oxide. For achieving the purpose as mentioned above, skin 
cosmetics based on this
