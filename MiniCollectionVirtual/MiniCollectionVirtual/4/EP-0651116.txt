<ABSTRACT>
Door lock comprising in a case, on the one hand, a deadbolt (25) displaceable in translational movement under the action of a lock-operating member and allowing at least one locking position, in which it projects relative to the edge of the door, and an unlocking position, in which it is substantially retracted in relation to the said edge, and, on the other hand, a locking member (82) or tumbler, movable transversely in relation to the direction of translational movement of the bolt (25) and capable of cooperating with teeth (90) carried by a bolt shank (89) fixed to the said bolt (25), in order to block the said bolt (25), the said tumbler (82) being associated with elastic means (87, 88) pushing it back towards the said shank (89), and cooperating with the operating member in order to unblock the bolt, the said lock comprising, inside the said case, a protective device consisting of a cage (70), within which the tumbler (82) is arranged, the said cage (70) being designed to guide the said bolt (25) and its associated shank (89) as well as the said tumbler (82).

Door lock, which lock (1, 10) comprises in a case 
(2), on the one hand, a deadbolt (25, 125) displaceable 

in translational movement under the action of a lock-operating 
member (6) and allowing at least one locked 

position, in which it projects relative to the edge of 
the door (P), and an unlocked position, in which it is 

substantially retracted relative to the said edge, and, 
on the other hand, a locking member (82, 182), or tumbler, 

movable transversely relative to the direction of 
translational movement of the bolt (25, 125) and capable 

of cooperating with teeth (90, 190) carried by a bolt 
shank (89, 189) integral with the said bolt (25, 125), in 

order to block the said bolt (25, 125), the said tumbler 
(82, 182) being associated with elastic means (87, 88, 

187, 188) pushing it towards the said shank (89, 189) and 
cooperating with the operating member (6) for the unblocking 

of the bolt, the said lock comprising a protection 
device inside the said case (2), characterized in 

that the protection device consists of a cage (70, 170), 
inside which the tumbler (82, 182) is arranged at least 

partially, the said cage being designed to guide the said 
bolt (25, 125) and its associated shank (89, 189) as well 

as the said tumbler (82, 182). 
Lock according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the cage (70, 170) straddles the tumbler (82, 182) 

virtually completely, the said elastic means (87, 88, 
187, 188), being placed inside the cage (70, 170) and 

being arranged between the latter and the tumbler (82, 
182). 
Lock according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the shank (89, 189) of the bolt 

(25, 125) includes an oblong orifice (91, 191) and the 
tumbler (82, 182) includes an oblong port (83, 183A, 

183B) extending orthogonally relative to the oblong 
orifice (91, 191), a guide stud (81, 181) carried by the 

cage (70, 170) passing through the oblong orifice (91, 
191) and the oblong port (83, 183A, 183B).  

 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the cage (70, 170) carries at least one 

boss (77, 277A, 277B) intended to be received in an 
orifice (80, 278A, 278B) in the case (2) of the lock (1, 

10). 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the cage (70) consists of two plates (74, 

75) made integral with one another by means of an upper 
spacer (71-73) and a lower spacer (79). 
Lock according to Claim 5, characterized in that 
the tumbler (82) consists of two plates (82A, 82B) made 

integral with one another by means of two transverse 
braces (99A, 99B) and straddles the shank (89) of the 

bolt (25). 
Lock according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
the elastic means (87, 88) are arranged between the 

transverse braces (99A, 99B, 109A, 109B) of the tumbler 
(82, 102) and a portion (71) of the upper spacer (71-73) 

of the cage (70). 
Lock according to one of Claims 5 to 7, characterized 
in that the operating member (6) is a cylinder 

and the cage (70) is limited by a border (78) in the form 
of an arc of a circle centred on the axis of the plug of 

the cylinder when the said cage is mounted in the lock 
(1). 
Lock according to one of Claims 5 to 8, characterized 
in that the lower spacer (79) of the cage (70) 

extends over a length such that, when the cage (70) is 
mounted in the lock (1) and the bolt (25) is fully 

extended in the locked position, no part of the shank 
(89) of the bolt (25) is in line with the lower spacer 

(79). 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the cage (170) is in two pieces or half-cages

Lock according to Claim 10, characterized in that 
the assembly means comprise tabs (171), carried by one 

half-cage (174, 175) and cooperating with wells or

174), and crosspins (172). 
Lock according to one of Claims 10 and 11,
