<ABSTRACT>
A receiver, comprising a plurality of antennas is set in a 

vehicle. Each antenna comprises a cylindrical bobbin and a 
dipole helical antenna wound on the bobbin. The bobbin is 

made of a synthetic resin and has a certain permittivity. 
The bobbin has flanged securing members at both ends and each 

securing member has a notch. To secure each antenna to a 
printed circuit board, built into the receiver, the notch of 

the securing member is fitted to the board. In this case, 
the arrangement of the antennas is determined in accordance 

with the electric field intensity and the electric field 
vector generated for various receiver setting positions in 

the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a receiver and an 
antenna, and more particularly, to an antenna incorporated in 
a receiver, the combination of which is used as part of a 
"wireless control system" for the remote control of a vehicle 
mounted equipment by low intensity radio waves. In the recent past, various types of motor vehicle equipment 
have been capable of remote control operation due to various 
types of wireless or remote control systems, one such system, 
is illustrated in Fig. 11, and includes a transmitter 33 that 
outputs a low intensity radio wave to a receiver 35 mounted 
on a vehicle 34. The transmitter 33 is typically 
incorporated into an ignition key 31 or a key holder 32 for 
convenience and ease in use by the vehicle's operator. In 
response to the low intensity signal, the receiver 35 effects 
operation of the equipment 36. It is possible in this way to 
lock or unlock the vehicle's doors, start the vehicle's 
engine as well as to control other vehicle functions at a 
location remote from the vehicle 34. Initially, the receiver's antenna for such a system was 
positioned outside the vehicle 34. Nowadays, however, it is  
 
popular to mount the combination antenna receiver 35 in the 
automobile 34 and to remove any related projections from the 
exterior surface of the vehicle 34 in order to enhance the 
vehicle's appearance. Often times the receiver and antenna 
are mounted under the seat and in the trunk. However, when the antenna is incorporated in the receiver, 
the particular mounting or positioning of the receiver and 
antenna in the vehicle is crucial to the operation of the 
system. The receiver's position, in particular, effects the 
gain and the directivity of the antenna. Antenna gain is 
defined as G = 4Ï€Pr/Pt where Pt is the total power delivered 
to the antenna and Pr is the power radiated per unit solid 
angle in a given direction. Antenna directivity is defined 
as D = Pr/Pa where Pa is the average power radiated per unit 
solid angle. Due to the fact that the vehicle itself is in 
large part a metallic envelope, the electric field used by 
the receiver inside the vehicle depends greatly on position 
of the antenna and receiver. Consequently, changes to the 
electric field, and to antenna gain and directivity in 
particular, are directly effected by the location and 
positioning of the antenna and receiver inside the vehicle 
34. Unfortunately, due to the limited space available for the 
receiver under a seat, in the trunk, or at the back of an  
 
instrume
