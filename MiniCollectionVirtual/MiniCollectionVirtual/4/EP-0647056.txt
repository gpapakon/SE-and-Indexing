<ABSTRACT>
An image recording apparatus includes a FAX unit 
(1) and a printer unit (2). The printer unit (2) has 

an ink-jet printing head (205), and records an image in 
accordance with image data received by the FAX unit 

(1). In this apparatus, when the power supply is 
turned on, the printer unit (2) performs a hard 

power-ON initialization process to initialize a 
watch-dog timer, registers, the work area of a RAM, and 

the like, and also initializes the RAM to erase data 
left in buffers. Thereafter, the printer unit 

transfers to a standby state. When a print request or 
a printer setting request is generated in the standby 

state, a soft power supply initialization process is 
executed to perform checking of the RAM, initialization 

of the work area, and initialization of carriage 
control and paper feed control, and the like. In the 

standby state, LEDs and the like of the printer unit 
are kept OFF. 
An operation error of the printer unit caused by 
remaining data can be prevented, and reliability of the 

apparatus can be improved. In addition, unnecessary 
power consumption can be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
recording apparatus, which comprises a data process
unit for receiving and processing image data, and
records an image on a recording medium in accordance
with image data from the data process unit.A conventional facsimile apparatus comprising a
facsimile (FAX) unit and a printer unit has the
following arrangement (Fig. 50).The FAX unit comprises an MPU 101 for controlling
the operation of the entire FAX unit, a ROM 102 for
storing control programs to be executed by the MPU 101,
a RAM 103 used as a work area for the MPU 101 and an
area for storing an image, a communication unit 104 for
transmitting/receiving data, and an image reader 105
for reading an image.The printer unit comprises an MPU 201 for
controlling the operation of the entire printer unit, a
ROM 202 for storing control programs to be executed by
the MPU 201, and a RAM 203 used as an area for storing
data to be printed supplied from the FAX unit, a work
area for the MPU 201, and the like.Furthermore, a signal line 301 for exchanging data
between the FAX unit and the printer unit is arranged. However, in the above-mentioned prior art, in a
state wherein the power switch is ON, the power
supplies of the FAX unit and the printer unit are
always set in an ON state.If the MPU 201 of the printer unit is always set
in a standby state, when a recording request for a
copying or reception operation from the MPU 101 of the
FAX unit, a print request from an external personal
computer (not shown), and the like are input in a
complicated order, the MPU 201 of the printer unit may
overrun due to, e.g., data left in the printer unit.If the same initialization as that executed in a
power-ON state is executed each time the printer unit
is initialized, the time required for initialization is
prolonged, resulting in a decrease in performance of
the system as a whole.In a state wherein the printer unit need not be in
a power-ON state, i.e., a standby state of a FAX main
body, or a mode such as a transmission mode which does
require a print operation, the printer unit is set in
the power-ON state, and an LED and the like are kept
ON, thus unnecessarily consuming electric power.If the LED of the printer unit is kept ON, a user
may erroneously recognize that the printer unit is
active even though the printer unit is inactive.When an error state of the printer unit is
detected upon error termination of the printer unit due 
to, e.g., a paper jam, and different error cancelling
methods are set in correspondence with detected
