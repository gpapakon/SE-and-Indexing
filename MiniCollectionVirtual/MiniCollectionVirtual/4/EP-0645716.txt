<ABSTRACT>
A termination circuit is provided for use in a SCSI 
host bus adapter which automatically inserts or removes 

an active terminator on the host adapter. The termination 
circuit includes a detection circuit for automatically 

sensing the presence of connections of an 
internal SCSI device and/or external SCSI device to the 

host adapter so as to generate an enable signal. Active 
terminators are responsive to the enable signal for 

selectively enabling its termination.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to terminator 
devices and more particularly, it relates to an automatic 
termination circuit means used with a SCSI (acronym for 
small computer system interface) host bus adapter. As is generally well-known in the art of computer 
equipment, a termination device is typically connected to 
each end of a SCSI bus line for supplying a fixed supply 
voltage with a predetermined impedance. One application 
where proper termination becomes important is where communication 
is to be established between a host small 
computer and a plurality of internal and/or external SCSI 
devices. The internal SCSI devices may be, for example, 
hard disk drives. Also, the external SCSI devices may be 
such as tape drives, CD-ROM drives, disk drives and the 
like. The host small computer is formed conventionally 
with a SCSI controller (referred to sometimes as an 
initiator or host bus adapter) located internally on a 
printed circuit board (PCB) which is used to transfer  
 
data and control signals to the plurality of internal 
and/or external SCSI devices. The host bus adapter (HBA) 
board includes an active termination device or terminator 
for the SCSI data and control signal lines. 
Traditionally, the active terminator is implemented with 
a termination network arrangement referred to as a 
"regulated terminator" which includes an individual 
voltage regulator for receiving an input voltage TERMPWR 
and for generating a regulated voltage of approximately 
+2.85 volts and a separate unit of eighteen (18) 110 ohms 
resistors coupled to respective data and control signal 
lines. This method defines a discrete terminator. These 
110-ohm resistors are usually packaged in a single-inline 
package (SIP) or dual-inline package (DIP) which are 
socketed on the HBA board. In order to decide whether 
the resistor package (SIP or DIP) has to be installed, 
the user must first determine the position of the HBA 
board. There are also manufacturers who make an alternate 
termination arrangement referred to as a "hybrid terminator" 
in which the voltage regulator and the terminating 
resistors are both housed in a single SOIC/TSSOP package. 
In these hybrid terminators, there is provided generally 
an ENABLE pin which is driven by a logic signal so as to 
permit the insertion or removal of the termination from 
the SCSI bus line. The HBA board further includes generally an external 
connector which is connectible via an external SCSI cable 
to the external SCSI device and an internal connector
