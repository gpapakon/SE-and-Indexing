<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an assembly of a container and a closure, the said container having a head comprising a neck extended by a shoulder (10) which connects this neck with a body or with a skirt, the said closure and the said head respectively having complementary means (12, 14 and 15) of locking in relative position by rotation, characterised in that these means respectively consist of an elastically flexible axial blade (12) carried by the closure and of profiled axial portions (14 and 15) carried by the said shoulder (10), these portions comprising a first portion (14) for the clip-in engagement and retention of the said blade (12) and a second portion (15) which is a stop-piece for the blade (12) ensuring its retention by the first portion (14). The invention applies to the manufacture and industrial closure of containers having clip-on or screw-type closures which must be oriented accurately with respect to a decoration or to the geometry of these containers.

<CLAIMS>
Assembly of a container (4) and a stopper (1), said 
container (4) having a head (3 and 10) comprising a neck (3) 

connected by a shoulder (10) to a body or to a skirt (9), the 
stopper (1) and the head (3 and 10) having respective 

complementary interlocking means (10, 14 and 15) with respect 
to the rotations of the stopper (1) relative to the container 

(4), said locking means comprising an elastically flexible 
axial blade (12) carried by the stopper (1) and profiled axial 

portions (14, 15) carried by the shoulder (10), these profiled 
portions comprising a first portion (14) having a first wall 

(19) which is inclined relative to a diametral axial plane of 
the container traversing it, against which the blade (12) will 

slide while being elastically deformed when the stopper (1) is 
set into rotation, the blade (12) then dropping by elastic 

return into a space between said portion (14) and a second 
profiled axial portion (15) against which the blade (12) 

abuts, the blade thus being locked in relative rotation, 
characterised in that: 


a) The blade (12) is fixed beneath the base of the stopper 
and is free beneath its fixing; 
b) the first portion (14) comprises a second wall (16) 
forming with the inclined wal
l (19) a V-shaped notch (20) 
turned toward the second abutment portion (15) and said 

inclined wall (19) ends with a terminal lateral edge (191) on 
which the blade (12) will catch by elastic return at the end 

of its sliding against said inclined wall (19) while dropping 
into said space between the V-shaped notch (20) and the 

abutment portion (15); 
c) either the second wall (16) of the first portion (14) ends 
at a distance from the second abutment portion (15) smaller 

than the circumferential width of the blade (12), or the second 
wall (16) of the first portion (14) is extended to the second 

abutment portion (15) and forms a continuous wall (160), the 
blade (12) dropped into said space then being trapped on all 

sides between the profiled portions (14) and (15). 
Assembly according to claim 1, in which the terminal edge 
(191) of the inclined wall (19) is located toward the interior 

of the shoulder (10) behind the blade (12) in the caught 
position. 
Assembly according to claim 1, in which the container (4) 
is of mouldable material and the stopper (1) is of elastically 

deformable plastics material. 
Assembly according to claim 3, in which the profiled axial 
portions (14, 15) are of plastics material moulded integrally 

with the head (3 and 10), said first inclined wall (19) of the 
first catching and retaining portion (14) having a thickness 

which decreases in the direction of its terminal lateral edge 
(191) and thus being elastically flexible. 
Assembly according to any of claims 1 to 4, in which said 
first wall (19) has, on the side external to the V-shaped notch 

(20), a surface (21) for engagement of said blade (12) which is 
inclined at 40 to 50° to said axial plane, said blade having at 

the front a lateral engagement bevel (22) with an inclination 
greater than the inclination of said engagement surface (21) and 

comprised between 45 and 55°. 
Assembly according to any of claims 1 to 5, in which said 
blade (12) has a circumferential width of 24 to 32° and a 

thickness of 2 to 3 mm. 
Assembly according to claim 6, in which said blade has a 
rear internal lateral bevel (25) allowing it to enter further 

into said V-shaped notch (20) and in which said distance from the 
end of the second wall (16) to the abutment portion (15) is at 

most equal to 20°. 
Assembly according to claim 6 or claim 7, in which said 
first wall (19) of the first profiled portion (14) ends at a 

distance from the abutment portion (15) which is 1 to 3° less 
than said circumferential width of the blade.  

 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, in 
which the stopper can be screwed rapidly on the neck and in 

which the blade (12) has, at its lower end, a bevel (24) 
facing the exterior of the stopper (1) thus allowing this 

blade (12) to escape from random engagement resting on the 
abutment portion (15). 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, in 
which said blade (12) has a height of at least 6 mm and 

engages between said profiled portions (14, 15) over at least 
2/3 of its height. 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, in 
which said stopper (1) is fixed on the neck (3) by catching 

and is orientated relative to said body or to said skirt (9) 
by rotation and locking of said blade (12) of the stopper (1) 

between said profiled portions (14, 15) carried by said 
shoulder (10) of the container (4). 
Assembly according to claim 9 in which said stopper is 
fixed on the neck (3) and locked with a selected orientation 

by less than one and a half screw turns. 
Use of the assembly of the stopper (1) and the container (4) 
according to any one of claims 1 to 12 in a stoppering 

installation in which the stopper is driven onto the neck (3) 
of the container (4), then this stopper (1) is rotated 

relative to the container (4) until a selected standstill 
torque is obtained, proving said lock.
