<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lighting 
device particularly suitable for use in the field of 
motor vehicles, for the construction of headlamps or 
optical systems of various types, for example. The distribution of the light flux emitted from 
certain lighting devices, for example from headlamps of 
motor vehicles, has to meet particular requirements, 
especially in respect of the intensity and direction of 
the radiation emitted, in order to provide correct 
illumination and to conform with the stipulations of laws 
and regulations of various types. A predetermined distribution of the light flux 
(in respect of both he direction of the rays emitted and 
their intensity) in the space outside the lighting device 
is normally achieved by means of conventional optical 
means comprising prisms and lenses of various types, 
which modify, by refraction and/or by total reflection, 
the direction of the light rays which fall on these 
means; in some cases, the prisms and lenses are formed 
directly in the screens which frontally delimit the 
lighting device. This category includes lighting devices which 
typically use a parabolic reflecting surface and a 
prismatic surface. In the particular case of what are 
known as elliptical headlamps, the reflector has an inner 
reflecting surface which is normally produced by rotation 
of an arc of an ellipse about an axis (ellipsoid of 
rotation). The source of light radiation is disposed 
opposite the first focus of the ellipsoid and, therefore, 
the rays emitted from the source and falling on the 
surface of the reflector are focused at the second focus 
in whose plane is disposed a diaphragm of suitable form; 
the headlamp also comprises a lens disposed after the 
said diaphragm, on which lens the light radiation from 
the second focus of the ellipsoid falls to generate the  
 
outgoing light flux with a suitable distribution of 
light. Devices of the type described, comprising optical 
refracting and reflecting means, are structurally rather 
complex, owing to the high number of their component 
parts and to the shape of some of them. Moreover, 
particularly in the case of elliptical headlamps, the 
optical efficiency is particularly low (of the order of 
30%). Furthermore, such devices have large overall 
dimensions, particularly in the direction of the optical 
axis, and additional operations, which have to be 
executed with particular care, are required to fit them 
on the body of the vehicle. Holographic optical systems have also been 
proposed to control
