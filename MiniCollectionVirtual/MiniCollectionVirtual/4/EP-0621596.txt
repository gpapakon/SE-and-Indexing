<ABSTRACT>
In a memory control device (12) for controlling write-in/read-out operation for 
memory means (13), a sector data storing area and an additive area are set in each of 

sector-based data storing areas in the memory means. A prescribed datum is stored in the 
additive area associated with the sector-based data stored in the sector data storing area. The 

access addresses for the additive area are generated on the basis of the sector count value when 
the sector data write-in or read-out is carried out in the memory means (13). The access 

addresses are calculated by the memory control device (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to reproducing apparatus for reproducing data, for
example audio data, etc., from a recording medium, for example a disc-shaped
recording medium.Rewritable magneto-optical discs on which a user can record music data, etc.
have been proposed. The shockproof function of these discs can be improved by
utilizing a buffer RAM.In a reproducing operation, audio data read out from a magneto-optical disc
is intermittently written into a buffer RAM at a high rate. Then this data is
continuously read out from the buffer RAM at low rate while conducting a
demodulation processing to obtain audio reproduction signals. In this way, a certain
amount of data is accumulated in the buffer RAM at all times. Thus, the audio data
can be continuously read out from the buffer RAM even when a track jump occurs
due to external vibration or the like and the data read-out operation from the
magneto-optical disc is temporarily interrupted, so that the reproduced signals can be
output without interruption.Further, in a recording operation, input data is continuously and temporarily
written into the buffer RAM at a low rate. This data is then intermittently read out
at a high rate and supplied to a recording head to perform a recording operation on
the disc.A recording track of the magneto-optical disc comprises continuously-formed
clusters CL each of which includes a sub data area of 4 sectors and a main data area
of 32 sectors as shown in Fig. 1. Each cluster comprises 36 sectors and each sector
comprises 2352 bytes.One cluster serves as a minimum unit for the recording operation. One cluster
has the length corresponding to two or three rounds of the disc. An address is
recorded for every sector. The sub data area of 4 sectors is used for sub data or as
a linking area. TOC data, audio data, etc. are recorded in the main data area of 32
sectors.The sector is further divided into sound groups. Two sectors are divided into
11 sound groups. The data are recorded in a sound group of 424 bytes while being 
separated into left and right channels. Each sound group contains audio data whose
time corresponds to 11.6 msec. Further, 212 bytes which serve as a data area of
Left-channel or Right-channel is called a "sound frame".When the recording and/or reproducing operation is conducted through the
buffer RAM on data which is recorded on the disc having the format described above,
the buffer RAM carries out its storage operation on a sector basis. That is, a sector
address and a byte address (0 to 2351 byte) in the
