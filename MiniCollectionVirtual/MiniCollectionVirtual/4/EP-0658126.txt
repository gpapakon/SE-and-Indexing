<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides for gas separation membranes with superior gas transport properties made from a blend of certain polymers. In particular, certain alkyl substituted aromatic polyimides, polyamides or polyamide-imides are blended with certain aromatic polyimides to provide a gas separation membrane with superior productivity and good selectivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to gas separation membranes 
cast from a polymer blend. More specifically, the invention relates to gas 
separation membranes, fabricated from a blend of aromatic polyimide, 
polyamide and polyamide-imide polymers. The precise gas transport 
properties of the membrane may be adjusted based on the blending of the 
specific polymer components. It is well known to employ permeable membranes to separate or 
selectively enrich a gas mixture. It is also generally known that gas 
separation membranes may be cast from polymers. The separation of gas 
components by polymer membranes is thought to depend on chemical 
affinities, kinetics and structural characteristics; it being known generally that 
rubbery polymers are characterized by high diffusion and relatively low 
selectivity while glassy polymers are characterized by lower diffusion and 
higher selectivities. Polymer blending has traditionally been thought to be either 
problematic or of no benefit in the membrane field, primarily because 
different polymers are generally not miscible with one another. Those few 
polymers which are thought to be miscible offer no blending advantage in the 
membrane field because of various reasons, including difficulty in blending, 
poor mechanical properties, limited range of gas transport properties, and 
complex relationships between blend composition and gas transport 
properties. U.S. Patent No. 5,055,116 describes a blend of aromatic polyimides, in 
which the blending of the polymer components is adjusted to achieve certain 
permeability and selectivity of a polymer membrane. The final properties of 
a new polymer membrane may be predicted so that a membrane with those 
desired final properties can then be manufactured. U.S. Patent No. 5,055,116 indicates that the gas transport properties 
of the membrane prepared from the polyimide blends are predictable and 
the membrane may be "engineered" to achieve the desired final properties.  
 
To the contrary, the gas transport properties of the present invention are 
unpredictable and surprisingly good. The present invention provides for gas separation membranes made 
from a blend of polyimide, polyamide and polyamide-imide polymers. The 
gas permeability and selectivity of these membranes is superior. The 
inventive membranes prepared from the blends of this invention are 
extremely useful in separation processes involving, for example, H2, N2, 
CH4, CO, CO2, He, and O2, by virtue of the high permeability and selectivity 
exhibited
