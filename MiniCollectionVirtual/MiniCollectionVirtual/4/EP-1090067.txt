<ABSTRACT>
Acrylic resin-based plastisol compositions are improved by the incorporation of recycled paint polymer containing uncured resin (i.e., substances containing functional groups capable of undergoing chemical reaction). The compositions may be used to apply coatings to stiff articles having a tendency to vibrate such as metal automobile parts and the like. Such coatings are effective in suppressing mechanical vibration, reducing the noise of particle impact, and/or lowering the amount of air vibration in a cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ACOUSTIC DAMPENING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING RECYCLEDPAINT POLYMERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention pertains to plastisol compositions based on acrylic resins such as polymethyl methacrylates which are capable of being sprayedonto automotive underbodies and the like. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of recycled paint polymer containing uncured resin to improve the acoustic dampening performance of such plastisols.Discussion of the Related ArtNearly all vehicles, machines and appliances produced currently are comprised of relatively thin metal sheeting or plates. These thin plates often have a pronounced tendency to vibrate due to the effect of mechanically moving parts or running engines. Such vibration leads to the undesirable generation ofsound. Another source of noise, particularly in automobiles and other vehiclestravelling on a road or other surface, is the debris such as gravel, sand, waterand the like which is thrown up by the wheels of a vehicle against the wheel wells and the underbody of the vehicle. Sound may also be generated by thevibration of air within the cavities of a moving vehicle.Numerous ways in which the noise associated with vibratory solid articlesmay be reduced have been proposed in the past. One common approach is to 

 2 cover the thin metal plating used in vehicles, appliances and other machinerywith a layer of a coating which deadens or absorbs sound. Visco-elasticcoatings based on various polymers have often been employed for such purposes. Plastisols based on PVC (polyvinyl chloride), for example, have been modified to have better soundproofing properties in the working temperaturerange of -20°C to +60°C than conventional sprayable coating materials basedon PVC resins (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,555). Acoustically active sprayable plastisol compositions based on styrene copolymers, alkyl methacrylate homopolymers, and/or methyl methacrylate copolymers are also known from U.S. Patent Number 5,741 ,824 (Butschbacher et al.). While suchmaterials are effective as soundproofing coatings, there is still a need for further improvements in the field. For example, it would be desirable to develop alternative coating formulations which have a lower cost of production or which are even better at suppressing noise and vibration.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe invention provides a plastisol composition useful for suppressingmechanical vibration, reducing particle impact noise, or lowering air vibration in a cavity.
