<DESCRIPTION>
 RECOMBINANT ANTIGEN CONTAINING IN ITS SEQUENCE A HETEROLOGOUS IMMUNOSTIMULATORY DOMAIN - USE AS A VACCINEField of the Invention-*K The present invention relates to recombinant peptide antigens for use as vaccines which display improved immunogenicity. The antigens comprise an immunostimulatory domain inserted within the peptide sequence of the recombinant antigen.10Background to the InventionThe efficacy of peptide antigens in stimulating the immune responses of an organism has been documented to be greatly 15 enhanced by the coadministration, with the antigen, of an adjuvant.This need is occasioned by the low immunogenicity of certain antigens which gives rise to the stimulation of an antibody 20 response insufficient to confer effective protective immunity in vivo.Poor immunogenicity is unfortunately a characteristic of recombinant antigens, which are major candidates for future25 human and animal vaccination (Edgington, 1992, Biotechnology, . 1Q.I 763). There exists therefore a requirement for an adjuvant which may be used in conjunction with recombinant antigens which will boost their antigenicity and increase their effectiveness in vaccines.30A number of adjuvants are known in the art which increase the antigenicity of peptide antigens. One of the most commonly-used adjuvants is Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant, a water-in-oil emulsion into which the antigen is introduced35 in the aqueous phase. This emulsion is resistant to dispersal within an organism and functions to release the antigen slowly, leading to prolonged antigen stimulation. 

The addition of killed bacterial material provides enhanced adjuvanticity by stimulating macrophages to produce factors which enhance the immune system's response to antigens. For example, heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis is included in Freund's Complete Adjuvant.Unfortunately, Freund's Adjuvant is unsuitable for use in humans as it has a number of well-known side-effects. Other adjuvants, such as aluminium salts which are approved for human vaccination, are inefficient and not devoid of unwanted side-effects (Pineau et al . , 1992, Toxicology, 73., 117) .New generation adjuvants which contain muramyl dipeptide (MDP) derivatives such as N-acetyl-muramyl-L-threonyl-D- isoglutamine (thr-MDP) , disclosed in U.S. patent No. 4,606,918, N-acety1-normuramyl-L-alany1-D-isoglutamine (nor- MDP) and N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanine- 2-(1*-2*dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-hydroxyphosphoryloxy)- ethylamine (MTP-PE) are currently under investigation for use in
