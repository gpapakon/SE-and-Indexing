<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a composition for the permanent waving of human hair, which contains thioglycolic acid or salts thereof, preferably the ammonium salt, and which consists of two mixtures which are kept separate from one another until used, where mixture (A) contains an amino acid hydrochloride and at least one polyol or its methyl and ethyl ether, in particular 1,2-propanediol, in aqueous solution and preferably has a pH between about 4.5 and 6.5, and the second mixture (B), which is kept separate therefrom, contains ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium carbonate and/or ammonium carbamate as alkalising agent, where the pH is between about 8 and 9.5, and the two mixtures are mixed together immediately before use, adjusting a pH between about 7 and 8. The mixtures which are kept separate from one another have excellent stability; on use after mixing, an optimal waving efficacy with, at the same time, a gentle action on the hair is achieved.

Composition for permanent waving of human hair, containing 
thioglycolic acid or a salt thereof and comprising two compositions 

which are kept separate until application, whereby a 
Composition (A) contains at least one amino acid hydrochloride, 

and at least one polyol or methyl or ethyl ethers thereof in an 
aqueous solution, having a pH-value of about 4.5 to 6.5, and a 

second Composition (B), being kept separate from Composition 
(A), contains ammonium carbonate, ammonium hydrogen carbonate 

and (or) ammonium carbamate, wherein the pH-value is about between 
8 and 9.5, whereof both compositions are mixed before application 

onto human hair, and the ready-to-use Composition 
(AB) produced thereby has a pH-value between 7 and 8. 
Composition for permanent waving of human hair according to 
claim 1, wherein the Composition (A) contains thioglycolic acid 

and (or) a salt thereof in combination with amino acid hydrochlorides 
and at least one polyol or methyl or ethyl ether 

thereof in aqueous solution. 
Composition according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
Composition (A) has a pH-value between 5.0 and 6.0. 
Composition according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
Composition (B) has a pH-value between 8.5 and 9.2.  

 
Composition according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that Composition (AB), ready-to-use for application 

onto the hair, obtained by admixture of Compositions (A) and 
(B), has a pH-value between 7.3 and 7.7. 
Composition according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that it contains cysteine hydrochloride as the amino 

acid hydrochloride. 
Composition according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it contains glycine hydrochloride as the 

amino acid hydrochloride. 
Composition according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that Composition (A) comprises 1 to 15% by 

weight of a polyol or a methyl or ethyl ether thereof. 
Composition according to claim 8, characterized in that 
Composition (A) comprises 1,2-propanediol and (or) glycerol. 
Composition according to claim 8, characterized in that 
Composition (A) comprises 1-methoxypropanol(-2) and (or) dipropyleneglycol 

monomethylether. 
Composition according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises 1 to 5% by weight ammonium 

hydrogen carbonate.
