<ABSTRACT>
An electrical distribution connector has a carrier strip unit (5) that supports a line of connection terminals that are fixed to connecting bushes accessible through the front plate. Connecting cables are brought through apertures formed between contact spring fingers (8) on the angled surface of the cover. The fingers (8) are produced as pressings in a thin metal unit. The cables have an outer screening that is engaged by the contact fingers. The complete region is enclosed by an outer screening cover (7).

<CLAIMS>
A shielded casing for a distribution assembly comprising an outer casing (1) with
insertion openings (2) for cables (3) which can be inserted in the casing from the rear and, lying

adjacent one another, can be connected to terminals (4) in the casing wherein a mounting plate
(5) with means (6) for attaching the cables (3) and terminals is provided inside the outer casing

(1), wherein a covering casing (7) covering the cables (3), the terminals and the mounting plate
(5) is provided inside the outer casing (1), and wherein the covering casing (7) and mounting

plate (5) form a substantially closed internal screening casing, and the cables (3) are taken
through between an edge ofthe covering casing (7) and the mounting plate (5).
A casing according to claim 1, characterised in that the edge ofthe covering casing (7)
facing towards the cables (3) has contact springs (8) for contacting the exposed cable screens

(16).
A casing according to claim 2, characterised in that the contact springs (8) extend
substantially parallel with the mounting plate (5).
A casing according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the mounting plate (5) has a
desk-like structure.
A casing according to claims 3 and 4, characterised in that the contact springs (8) are
arranged in the inclined section (9) ofthe plate (5).
A casing according to one or more ofthe preceding claims, characterised in that the
mounting plate (5) has a U-shaped punched tab (10) in the vicinity of each overlying cable (3),

which tab (10) projects from the plate (5) at an acute angle and is directed towards the cable.
the punched tab (10) being pressed back in the direction ofthe original position by the

mounting ofthe overlying cable.
A method of mounting a row of screened cables (3) in a shielded casing of a
distribution assembly according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the cables (3) are

attached to the mounting plate (5) by cable clamps (6) after removal oftheir external
insulation (18), that sheath wires (19) of the cables are clamped below a punched tab (10) of

the plate (5), that the covering casing (7) is placed on the plate (5) and cables (3), with contact
springs (8) resting on the screen (16) ofthe bared cables (3), and that the outer casing (1) is

finally placed and fixed on the covering casing (7).
