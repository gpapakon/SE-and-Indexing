<ABSTRACT>
This apparatus comprises two directional microphones (5, 6) in the interior space of the motor vehicle which are arranged approximately symmetrically with respect to a vertical plane (3) through the motor vehicle which is located approximately in the centre of the vehicle and parallel to the direction of travel, the signals picked up by the directional microphones (5, 6) being subtracted from one another in a device (9) before being passed on or processed further, and the difference being available as a high-quality useful signal.

<CLAIMS>
Noise-compensated handsfree speech system in motor 
vehicles with two microphones (5, 6) for the conversion of 

sound signals, the microphones (5, 6) being preferably 
designed as directional microphones, characterised in that 

the microphones (5, 6) are arranged symmetrically to a 
vertical plane (3) through the motor vehicle in the 

interior of the motor vehicle, which is located more or 
less at the centre of the vehicle and parallel to the 

direction of travel, and the sound signals converted by the 
microphones (5, 6) and if necessary amplified are 

subtracted from each other in a signal processing device 
(9), and in that this signal difference is transmitted as 

the wanted signal. 
Noise-compensated handsfree speech system in motor 
vehicles according to claim 1, characterised in that the 

microphones (5, 6) are arranged in the region of an 
interior mirror (4). 
Noise-compensated handsfree speech system in motor 
vehicles according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 

one of the microphones (5, 6) can be aligned with the 
driver's head. 
Noise-compensated handsfree speech system in motor 
vehicles according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that the microphones (5, 6) are mounted 
with limited pivotability in the interior of the motor 

vehicle in such a way that, when one microphone (5, 6) is 
pivoted, the other microphone (6, 5) is automatically 

pivoted in the opposite direction in such a way that the 
symmetry to the vertical plane (3) is always preserved.
