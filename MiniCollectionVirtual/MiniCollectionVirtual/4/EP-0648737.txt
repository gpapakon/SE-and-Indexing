<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a benzidine 
derivative represented by the general formula (1): 


wherein R¹ to R⁶, m and n are as defined in the present 
specification. The benzidine derivative improves durability 

and heat resistance of a membrane containing the same while 
maintaining high hole transferring capability. Therefore, an 

electrophotosensitive material, which comprises a 
photosensitive layer containing the benzidine derivative, has 

high sensitivity and is superior in durability and heat 
resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel benzidine
derivatives which are suitably used as charge transferring
materials, particularly hole transferring materials in
applications such as solar batteries, electroluminescent
devices, electrophotosensitive materials and the like, and
electrophotosensitive materials using the same.As charge transferring materials, there have been
known various organic compounds such as carbazole compounds,
oxadiazole compounds, pyrazoline compounds, hydrazone compounds,
stilbene compounds, phenylenediamine compounds, benzidine
compounds and the like.These charge transferring materials are normally
used in a state where they are dispersed in a membrane of a
suitable binding resin. In case of the electrophotosensitive
material, for example, so-called organic photosensitive
materials (OPC) such as single-layer type
electrophotosensitive materials comprising a single-layer type
photosensitive layer wherein the above charge transferring
material and a charge generating material which generates a
charge due to light irradiation are dispersed in a binding
resin, multi-layer type electrophotosensitive materials 
comprising a charge transferring layer containing the above
electric transferring material and a charge generating layer
containing a charge generating material, etc. are normally
used. Such an organic photosensitive materials have an
advantage that they are superior in processability and can be
easily produced, and which offers a great degree of freedom
for design of performance.Among these compounds, there can be suitably used a
3,3'-dimethylbenzidine derivative represented by the formula:

wherein Ra, Rb, Rc and Rd are same or different and indicate a
hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group or a
chlorine atom, which belongs to the benzidine derivative,
because of its high hole transferring capability and good
compatibility with the binding resin (see
JP-A-5-210099). However, the above 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine derivatives
have such a disadvantage that they have generally low melting
points (about 180 °C or less) and therefore the glass
transition temperature (Tg) of a membrane comprising the 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine
derivative dispersed in the binding resin
becomes low, which results in deterioration of durability,
heat resistance and the like.EP-A-0318916 discloses benzidine derivatives according
to the above general formula, in which Ra, Rb, Rc and Rd, are
hydrogen atoms, lower alkyl groups, lower alkoxy groups, or
halogen atoms and the methyl groups of the
