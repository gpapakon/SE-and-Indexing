<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for obtaining spatial
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) information from a solid sample, and particularly from
a sample having a short (e.g. less than 500µs) spin-spin relaxation time (T2). In general,
solids exhibit such a short T2.The possibility of magnetic imaging in solids has attracted considerable interest
recently. NMR imaging in solids is difficult because of the broad NMR lines. One
possible approach to the problem is to artificially narrow the line. Such an approach is
disclosed in UK Patent Application No. 2234594.An alternative to line narrowing has been described by Cottrell etal. in their paper
entitled "NMR imaging of solids using large oscillating field gradients" (Meas. Sci.
Technol. 1, 1990, 624). This paper discloses the use of large oscillating field gradients to
dominate the homogeneous dipolar broadening. A single 90° excitation pulse is applied
at the time when the field gradient passes through zero and a gradient echo is produced after
one complete gradient cycle. Because the 90° pulse is applied at the moment of zero
gradient, the RF power requirements are quite modest. The imaging scheme disclosed in
this paper used back projection.European Patent Application EP-A1-0181015 (den Boef) describes an imaging
sequence which includes two alternative gradient fields which are mutually perpendicular.
The periods are preferably the same. More free induction decay (FID) signals are obtained
therefore a reduction in the 3-D image is achieved.Although back projection methods have been conventionally used in solid state
NMR imaging, it would be advantageous to use two dimensional Fourier transform (2DFT)
techniques since these might be expected to lead to an improvement in image quality.According to the present invention, there is provided a
method of obtaining spatial NMR information from a solid sample, comprising:
producing a magnetic field in the sample having a static component, and having
first and second gradient field components in first and second directions, respectively,
said gradient field components being sinusoidal or cosinusoidal in time, the period of
one being twice the period of the other and the waveforms having simultaneous zero
crossing points;applying at least one excitation pulse to the sample, the or each excitation pulse
being applied at a time when both gradient field components are approximately zero;controlling the application of the or each excitation pulse and the production of the
gradient field
