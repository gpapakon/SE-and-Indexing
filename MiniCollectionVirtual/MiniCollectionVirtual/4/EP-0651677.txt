<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and methods for producing intermittent, discrete patterns (123) of foam coating material, onto discrete substrates (120) or substrate areas, where the patterns have sharp, square leading (121) and trailing (122) edges, as well as side edges (175, 176). A slot nozzle die has elongated air slots (61, 62) along the slot extrusion opening (40). Air flow is initiated from both air slots (61, 62) prior to the initiation of the foam flow. Also, the air flow is continued beyond that point in time when the foam flow ceases. The delays between the operations of the air flow and the foam coating flow are on the order of micro seconds. Alternatively, the lead and lag air start and stop times on each side of the foam coating material are different to control the exact disposition of the square cut-on and square cut-off coating edge (121, 122) on the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the application of coatings 
to substrates and more particularly to the application to 
substrates of discrete, uniform foam coating having sharp, 
square cut-on and cut-off edges. Many industrial applications require the use of 
discrete, well defined and uniform foam coatings applied to 
predetermined areas. Such coatings are very useful in 
varied lamination processes, such as, for example, in box 
flap sealing, application of foam to non-uniform surfaces, 
application of cushions of adhesive material onto 
substrates, and in other coating operations. In the production of discrete foam coatings and 
adhesives for lamination of discrete substrate areas, for 
example, it is desirable to obtain broad, uniform foam 
coatings in a non-contact application process with sharp 
and square cut-on and cut-off edges with no stringing of 
material. None of the processes currently known are 
entirely suitable for this application.  
 Many various devices have been used to apply foamed 
adhesives or coatings for lamination. Prior contact coaters 
present the inherent disadvantage of wear and substrate 
index and tension tolerances. Other foam producing devices 
use air flow to atomise or break up the foam prior to 
substrate contact. When used in carton or box flap sealing operations, 
prior adhesive foaming devices require special bracketry to 
mount the foam nozzles so they can be retracted and 
introduced alternately, to the substrate. Other devices have been used to apply hot melt 
adhesives. U.S. Patent No. 4,785,996 discloses a single 
round orifice nozzle through which an adhesive bead is 
extruded where it is engaged by air jets to swirl it in a 
spiral pattern. International Application No. WO 90/03847 
discloses a round orifice nozzle through which a bead of 
hot melt adhesive is extruded and is atomized by surrounding 
air jets. International Application No. WO 89/00459 
discloses a device for extruding a plurality of hot melt 
beads carried to a substrate separately. None of these deal 
with applying discrete foam coatings from an elongated 
slot-shaped outlet. While prior foam devices have proved useful in 
particular application, it is now desirable to provide 
apparatus and methods for producing discrete foam coatings 
onto predetermined substrate areas.  
 Accordingly, it has been one objective of this 
invention to produce broad, uniform, foamed adhesive 
coatings with sharp side edges and sharp, square leading 
and trailing edges on intermittently presented discrete 
subst

A method for applying a discrete foam coating to a 
substrate comprising the steps of: 


extruding foam coating material from an elongated 
slot nozzle (40); 
impinging air at an angle onto extruding foam 
coating material and from both sides thereof; 
then depositing extruded foam coating material 
onto said substrate (120, 174); and 
starting and stopping the extrusion of foam 
coating material and the flow of impinging air at 

preselected different times to produce discrete foam 
coatings (170-173) with oven leading and trailing edges. 
A method as in claim 1 wherein the starting and 
stopping of coating material and impinging air flow includes
