<ABSTRACT>
A structure for the erection of buildings (for a construction) like a hall, marquee, tent or the like includes gantries (6) consisting of a polygonal (main) truss (10), resting via each of its lower ends (13, 14) on at least one post (15, 15A). With a view to consolidating such a structure in order to improve its behaviour (steadiness), particularly with regard to the wind, at least one cable or tie (20) extends from a lower link point (21) located in each of the lower zones (22, 22A) defined by a post (15, 15A) and the part (23) corresponding to the lower third of the half-truss (24, 24A) resting on this post, respectively, (15, 15A) and delimited by the vertical median plane (16) of a gantry (6) as far as an upper link point (25) which is located in the upper two thirds (32A, 32) of the half-truss, respectively, (24A, 24) located on the other side of the vertical median plane (16) with respect to the said lower link point (21).
