<ABSTRACT>
An audio amplifier has a relatively low RMS power capability, so reducing the size and cost of the power components and associated heat sinks, but a relatively high peak power capability determined by the power supply voltage. Audio quality, especially for musical performances, is therefore good. An attenuator (12) is positioned before the power amplifier (18), controlled by an RMS detector (14) and threshold detector (16). Signals which after amplification would exceed the RMS power capability are attenuated.

<DESCRIPTION>
AUDIO AMPLIFIERSThis invention relates to audio amplifiers and in the most important example to audio power amplifiers capable of delivering high power audio signals to loud speakers. It is usual to rate audio power amplifiers in terms of the maximum root-mean-square (RMS) power levels that the amplifier is capable of delivering to a defined load impedance in response to a continuous sine wave input. Thus a typical power amplifier may be rated at 400 watts at 2 ohms. As will be recognised, the maximum peak power level will exceed the RMS value by around 3 decibels.Audio power amplifiers are typically expensive and relatively heavy. This is as a result principally of the cost and weight of power transformers, the cost of high rated power transistors and the weight of the associated heat sinks. Considerable efforts have been made to reduce the cost and weight of audio power amplifiers and reference is directed for example to WO 80/01023. Techniques disclosed in this reference and elsewhere include control of the duty cycle of the primary transformer winding to enable the use of smaller transformers; and switching between high and low voltage supply rails in dependence upon the audio level, so as to reduce dissipation in the power transistors. The switching can be performed in a variety of ways and suggestions for improvement are to be found in US 4,339,730 and US 4,498,057. It nonetheless remains the case that significant increases in the output power level of audio amplifiers have only been achievable at considerable cost.In the amplification of electronic instruments for public performance, there is a requirement for substantially increased power levels which can with existing technology only be met at very considerable cost. It is one object of this invention to meet the requirement for high power audio amplification using circuitry of substantially reduced costs. It is another object of this invention to 

improve the performance, through increasing the power capability, of audio amplification equipment within a particular price grouping.It has been recognised that, in the amplification of electronic musical instruments, the power rating that is of primary importance in creating the desired "sound" is not the RMS, (or any other average figure) but the peak power capability. Conventionally, power ratings have been considered in the context of continuous sine wave input signals. Peak and RMS power values are in this context in the fixed ratio of around 3 decibels.
