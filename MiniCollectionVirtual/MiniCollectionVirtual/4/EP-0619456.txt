<ABSTRACT>
In a fuel supply system with premix combustion, a gaseous and/or liquid fuel is injected as secondary flow into a gaseous channelised main flow. The secondary flow has a considerably smaller mass flow rate than the main flow. The main flow is guided over turbulence generators (9), a plurality of which are arranged next to one another over the circumference of the throughflow channel (20) on at least one channel wall. The secondary flow is introduced into the channel (20) in the immediate vicinity of the turbulence generators (9). One turbulence generator (9) has three faces around which there is a free flow, which extend in the flow direction and of which one forms the top face (10) and the other two the side faces (11, 13). The fuel is fed into the channel from nozzles located in front of, behind or in the turbulence generator.
