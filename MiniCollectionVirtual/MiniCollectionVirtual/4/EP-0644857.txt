<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a treatment installation consisting of one 
or more compartments connected in parallel, which compartments are provided 
with inlets and outlets and contain a filling of a support material, 
on which and between which microorganisms are present, as well as a 
method for treating water. Installations of this type are generally known and are used on a 
large scale. Good results are obtained with an installation of this type, 
but said installations are not suitable for all types of pollutant. Xenobiotic components which are present in waste water are frequently 
removed with the aid of filtration using active charcoal. Volatile 
components can also be removed from the aqueous phase by stripping. In 
this case it is necessary to subject the stripping air released to a 
subsequent treatment. This can be effected by means of an active charcoal 
filter. When xenobiotic components are removed from waste water by means of 
active charcoal filtration or stripping and when removing said components 
from the air phase, pollutant is transferred from one phase to another 
phase in these techniques. The phase in which the pollutant is bound, 
frequently active charcoal, still has to be treated afterwards in order 
to decompose pollutants. Biological purification techniques do not have this disadvantage; in 
these systems pollutants are completely converted into harmless residual 
products, such as biomass, CO2 and water. Biological purification techniques can roughly be subdivided into 
systems with suspended biomass and systems in which the biomass firmly 
adheres to the support material. One example of a biological purification technique in which use is 
made of suspended biomass for biological purification of waste water is 
an active sludge installation. This has the disadvantage that for low 
concentrations of pollutant the amount of biomass produced per volume of 
waste water treated is small. However, a high biomass concentration in 
the installation is required for a high removal capacity. At low pollutant 
concentrations a long sludge retention time is therefore required. 
This is difficult to realise in active sludge installations. Ground water which is released during soil treatment work frequently 
contains low (that is to say low in the absolute sense) concentrations of  
 
pollutants; however, the concentrations are still too high and the ground 
water therefore has to be treated before discharge. In bioreactors containing a support material, so-called biofilm 
reactors, there

A method of biological purification of water comprising 
passing polluted water through support material of an apparatus provided 

with aeration and one or more compartments connected in parallel, which 
compartments are provided with inlets and outlets and contain a filling 

of a support material on which and between which microorganisms are 
present, the pollutants being converted by microorganisms in the biofilm 

on the support material, characterized in that both polluted water and 
air are passed downwards through the support material with air forming 

the continuous phase such that the air:water ratio is not more than 1:1 
with the hydraulic surface loading of the apparatus being selected 

between 0.5-30 m
