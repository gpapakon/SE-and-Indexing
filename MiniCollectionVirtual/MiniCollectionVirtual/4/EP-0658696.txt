<ABSTRACT>
This relates to a tensor device for a cable kinematic 
chain, for example a window-winder for an automobile vehicle, 

made up of a triangular grooved cylindrical body (2), perpendicular 
to its shaft, which is mounted on one of the drive 

outlets, and receives a toothed open ring (3) in the opposite 
direction to the above, made of flexible thermoplastic material, 

which clamps onto the cylinder. Mounted inside the casing is a 
spring (4) which acts on the grooved cylindrical body. 
The relative movements of the ring and the cylindrical 
body on the casing, and of the cylinder on the ring and the 

casing provide the system with its double tensing capacity, 
which differentiates permanent stretching from temporary elongations 

caused by an overload on the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tensor or tensioner
for traction cables guided by flexible conductors. The
use of multicore steel cables in the transmission of movements
over a distance by means of winding on a drum
implies the need for a system for tensing the cable so
that it gathers up the elongation through stretching of
the cable caused by the settling of each of the strands
of wire that make up each cable, all of which is the result
of the successive passing of the said cable over
pulleys and other devices for changing direction which
are included in the kinematic chain. This elongation of
the cable is defined as nonreversible.The cable, like any other element, suffers reversible
elastic deformations during its operation, with
these deformations being proportional to the stresses to
which it is submitted, and on which intervention is not
interesting, since these deformations will disappear
when the stresses are removed. Acting on this elongation
would cause the kinematic chain to be overtightened,
which would have repercussions in that the system would
operate incorrectly.Several devices intended for solving the problems
of this nonreversible deformation are known but,
in general, they have the disadvantages of being made up
of a large number of component parts, occupying an excessive
amount of space and also needing labour-intensive
assembly processes. Their industrialization using automatic
techniques is also difficult.One of these cases is represented in EP-A-0
224 399, whereby a tensor is described in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, in which a 
locking part and a drive organ provided with a conical
part collaborate, with these including pairs of coactive
surfaces in the form of a ramp.This mechanism presents the disadvantages of its
complexity and its assembly, which is labour-consuming
and complicated.As opposed to all these known techniques, the
objective of the invention is a device or system which 
is capable of offering all the benefits and advantages
of the known systems, while overcoming all their limitations.Another objective of the invention is to provide
a device or system which is small in volume and capable
of being placed at any point of the kinematic chain.A third objective of the system is that when the
device or system is integrated into the drive, it is
made up of only three parts, one of which is the spring.A fourth objective of the invention is the fact
of being able to eliminate the second spring used in traditional
automatic tensing systems and which only adds
an

Tensor for traction cables (6) inserted into a
drive mechanism or into an independent support and

guided by flexible conductors (5), having

a casing (1)
a toothed cylindrical support (2) for the flexible
conductor (5) which is mounted axially slidable in

the casing (1) and through which the cable (6) can run,
a spring (4) to bias the toothed cylindrical support

a locking member (3) carried on the housing characterized
in that
the casing (1) is provided with a ring-shaped
portion (10) with a reduced outer diameter, in which

three windows or holes (17) have been cut, evenly spaced

cylindrical support (2) is housed,
the ring-shaped portion (10) of the casing is bound
on each side by a projection or rib (7,8), one (8) of which is

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, on the side nearer
the spring (4), whereas the other (7) is provide with a

a ring-shaped recess (13) is cut in the toothed cylindrical support, near the end there of,
on the side towards the spring and at the end of

the teeth,

to a generatrix, inside of which three teeth (14) are
formed, separated from each other at an angle of 120

degrees and partially occupying the height of the ring, 
which fit into the windows or holes (17) in the ring-shaped

recess in the casing (1) until they connect with the

of the teeth (14) being such that they provide axial play in
the said windows (17), maintaining a distance (11) between the 

teeth (14) and the side of the windows nearer to the ramp (9)
