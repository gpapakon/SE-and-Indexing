<ABSTRACT>
A folding box (10, 10a, 50) with a hanger (25, 25a) arranged in it is proposed. At one end, the folding box (10, 10a, 50) has closure flaps (20, 20a, 20b, 53, 54) which have essentially U-shaped or V-shaped cutouts (22, 22b, 55, 56) and form a closure. In the base of the U-shaped or V-shaped cutouts (22, 22b, 55, 56), a hole (23) is produced when the closure flaps (20, 20a, 20b, 53, 54) are folded over one another, in which hole the hanger (25, 25a) is arranged. The hanger (25, 25a) has a hanging eye (26, 26a) and an anchor (28, 28a) which may be connected to said eye via a web (27). The anchor (28, 28a) has a plate (36, 36a) and a collar (40, 40a) with spacing above it, between which plate and collar the closure flaps (20, 20a, 20b, 53, 54) are arranged.

<CLAIMS>
Packaging container having a hanger (25, 25a), 
which has a hanging eye (26, 26a) and an anchor 

(28, 28a), which has a plate (36, 36a) at one end and 
engages through a hole (23) in one wall of the packaging 

container, the hole (23) being formed from a largely U-or 
V-shaped cutout (22, 22a, 22b, 55, 56), characterized 

in that the packaging container consists of a folded box 
(10, 10a, 50) with a closure formed from mutually overlapping 

closure flaps (20, 20a, 20b, 53, 54), in that the 
cutout (22, 22a, 22b, 55, 56) is formed in at least one 

of the closure flaps (20, 20a, 20b, 53, 54), and in that 
the hanger (25, 25a) is arranged rotatably in the 

packaging container. 
Packaging container according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that each of the mutually overlapping closure 

flaps (20, 20a, 20b, 53, 54) has a cutout (22, 22a, 22b, 

55, 56), with the result that the base of the cutouts 
(22, 22a, 22b, 55, 56) forms the hole (23). 
Packaging container according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that wings formed by the cutouts (22, 55, 56) 

in the closure flaps (20, 53, 54) are located one above 
the other on one side and one below the other on the 

other side. 
Packaging container according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the anchor (28, 28a) has a 

collar (40, 40a) above the plate (36, 36a), and in that 
the closure flaps (20, 20a, 20b, 53, 54) are arranged 

between the plate (36) and the collar (40). 
Packaging container according to Claim 4, characterized  
 

in that the distance between the collar (40, 40a) 
and the plate (36, 36a) of the anchor (28, 28a) corresponds 

at least to the thickness of the closure flaps 
(20, 20a, 20b, 53, 54) arranged between them. 
Packaging container according to either Claim 4 
or 5, characterized in that the bearing surface (43) of 

the anchor (28, 28a) is greater than the bearing surface 
(41) of the collar (40, 40a). 
Packaging container according to one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that there is arranged on the 

plate (36) of the anchor (28) at least one stop rib (44) 
against which folding flaps (18) butt which extend 

underneath the closure flaps (20, 53, 54), which are 
arranged between the collar (40) and the plate (36), and 

the plate (36), with the result that when the hanger (25) 
is rotated in the folded box (10, 50) a pressure point 

results. 
Packaging container according to one of Claims 4 
to 6, characterized in that the part of the anchor (25a) 

between the plate (36a) and the collar (40a) is subdivided 
into two sections (48, 49), of which the first 

section (48) close to the collar (40a) has a cross-section 
having at least two guiding surfaces (45) whose 

spacing (b) is matched to the width (B) of the cutout 
(22a) in the closure flap (20a), in that the second 

section (49) close to the plate (36a) has a height which 
is at least as large as the thickness of the two closure 

flaps (20a, 20b), and in that the second section (49) has 
a smaller cross-sectional area than the first section 

(48), with the result that the hanger (25a) is arranged 
in a first position in a rotationally secure manner with 

its first section (48) in the cutout (22a) of the closure 
flap (20a), and in a second position rotatably with its 

second section (49) in the cutout (22a) of the closure 
flap (20a). 
Packaging container according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the first section (48) has a U- or 

rectangular-shaped cross-section, in that the second 
section (49) has a half-shell-like cross-section with an  

 
outer diameter (d), and in that the width (b) of the 

first section (48) is greater than or equal to the outer 
diameter (d) of the second section (49).
