<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing iron oxide pigments from the waste acid resulting from the production of titanium dioxide according to the sulfate process. The invention is characterized in that in a first step the sulphuric acid contained in the waste acid is partially neutralized with metallic iron compounds and/or iron compounds and possibly neutralized further with another alkaline compound. The precipitate containing Ti, Al, Cr and V compounds is separated from the reaction product obtained in this way. From the resulting iron-sulfate-containing solution an iron oxide yellow pigment or a black iron oxide pigment is precipitated by addition of alkaline compounds and an oxidizing agent. Both pigments can be converted by calcination into an iron oxide red pigment.

Process for the preparation of iron oxide black
pigments from the waste acid resulting from the

production of titanium dioxide by the sulfate process,

characterised in that
 in a first stage a partial
neutralisation of the sulfuric acid contained in the

waste acid is performed with compounds from the group
comprising metallic iron and/or iron compounds, the

precipitate containing Ti, Al, Cr and V compounds is
separated from the resultant reaction product, and an

iron oxide black pigment is precipitated from the
resultant iron(II) sulfate-containing solution by

addition of alkaline compounds as well as an oxidizing
agent.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the neutralisation of the waste acid with
metallic iron or iron compounds is carried out at

a pH of 0.5 to 4.7, preferably 2.5 to 4.7.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

after the neutralisation of the waste acid with
metallic iron or iron comopunds, further

neutralisation is performed with a further alkaline
compound.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the neutralisation of the waste acid in the first
stage is carried out successively with two or more

iron-containing materials of different reactivity.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the neutralisation of the waste acid in the first
stage is carried out first of all with a less reactive 

iron-containing material at a pH of 0.5 to 3.5 and
then with a more reactive iron-containing material at

a pH of 2.5 to 4.7.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

mill scale is used as the less reactive iron-containing

material and cast iron turnings are used as
the more reactive iron-containing material.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the metallic iron used for the partial neutralisation
of the waste acid in the first stage and the basic

iron compounds have a manganese content of 
<
0.8% Mn,
referred to Fe, preferably a manganese content of


<
0.4% Mn, referred to Fe.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

after the addition of the metallic iron or iron
compounds the further neutralisation of the solution

is carried out with alkaline compounds at a pH of 3.0
to 5.0, preferably at a pH of 3.8 to 4.8.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 as
further neutralising agent in the first stage alkaline

compounds are used that form sparingly soluble
sulfates.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 as
further neutralising agent in the first stage power

station ash, refuse incineration ash or another
alkaline reacting ash is used.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 by
separating the Ti-, Al-, Cr- and V-containing solids
