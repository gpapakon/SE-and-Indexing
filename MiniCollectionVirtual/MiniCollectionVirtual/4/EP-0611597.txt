<ABSTRACT>
A microtitration unit comprises at least one container of 
transparent material for accommodating biological test reaction 

mixtures. The container is subdivided into at least two chambers 
suitable for accommodating different test reaction mixtures by at 

least one partition which extends from the inside of the bottom of the 
container and which is of lower height than the internal height of the 

container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a microtitration unit 
having at least one container which comprises transparent 
material and which has an opening for accomodating a 
biological test reaction mixture. Microtitration units of that kind which are 
generally in the form of a plate having a plurality of 
containers arranged in juxtaposed relationship are used for 
the routine investigation of biological fluids for 
medicament residues. The investigation essentially extends 
to the presence of antibiotics and sulphonamides. For that 
purpose the containers are partially filled with a 
biological test reaction mixture which is usually made up on 
the basis of agar-agar nutrient media and contains test 
micro-organisms and a colour indicator. The biological fluid 
to be investigated, for example milk, is pipetted onto the 
biological test reaction mixture in the container. The 
container is then possibly closed and then incubated at the 
optimum temperature of the test micro-organisms in an 
incubation cabinet or in a water bath. During the incubation 
operation any medicament residues diffuse out of the 
biolgical fluid to be investigated into the test reaction 
mixture and impede metabolism of the test micro-organisms. 
If metabolism occurs, there is a change in colour of the 
colour indicator, for example from blue to yellow. The 
presence of medicament residues is indicated by the absence 
of a change in colour. In order to be able to detect all possible 
medicament residues, tests are required, with at least two 
different test reaction mixtures. That requires a plurality  
 
of test operations and is accordingly time-consuming and 
expensive. The object of the present invention is to improve 
microtitration units of the kind set forth in the opening 
part of this specification, in such a way that tests of a 
sample are possible in one working operation, with a 
plurality of different test reaction mixtures. In accordance with the invention that object is 
attained with the features of claim 1. The container is subdivided 
into at least 
two chambers suitable for accomodating different test 
reaction mixtures, by at least one partition which extends 
from the inside of the bottom and which is of smaller height 
than the internal height of the container. A plurality 
of different test reaction mixtures can be introduced into a 
container or each container of a microtitration unit, more 
specifically preferably in such a way that the partition 
projects upwardly slightly above the filling level of the 
diffe

<CLAIMS>
A microtitration unit having at least one container which 
comprises transparent material and which has an opening for accommodating a 

biological test reaction mixture, characterised in that the container is subdivided 
into at least two chambers by at the least one partition (5) which extends from the 

inside of the bottom and which is of lower height than the internal height of the container 
the at least two chambers accommodating different biological test reaction mixtures (6, 7), 

the biological test reaction mixture being disposed in the chambers 
in such a way that the at least one partition projects above the filling level of the 

different biological test reaction mixtures and the biological test reaction 
mixtures are made up on the basis of agar-agar nutrient media. 
A microtitration unit according to claim 1 characterised in that a 
plurality to containers (10) are arranged in juxtaposed relationship. 
A method for testing a biological test fluid for medicament 
residues comprising 


introducing in a microtitration unit according to claim 1, such an 
amount of biological test fluid that the top edge of the at least one partition is 

flooded over by said biological test fluid and 
detecting the medicament residues.
