<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved ion scattering 
spectroscopy for analyzing a sample surface under ultra high vacuum 

comprising steps of irradiating an ion beam of a small mass number inert 
gas (preferably helium, acceleration energy preferably equal to or 

smaller than 1keV) 
onto the sample surface, analyzing distribution of energy of ions 

scattered by the sample surface, irradiating an ion beam of a relatively 
large mass number inert gas (preferably neon or argon, acceleration 

energy preferably equal to or smaller than 1keV) 
onto the sample surface so as to remove one 

atomic layer from the sample surface, irradiating an ion beam of the 
small mass number inert gas to the newly exposed sample surface and 

analyzing distribution of energy of ions scattered at the newly exposed 
sample surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved ion scattering 
spectroscopy and an apparatus for the ion scattering spectroscopy, and 
more specifically to improved ion scattering spectroscopy and an 
apparatus which can analyze the geometrical position and the composition 
of surface atoms layer by layer. Ion scattering spectroscopy is a surface analysis in which 
accelerated ions irradiate a surface of a sample and spectra of scattered 
ion is measured so as to analyze surface composition and geometrical 
position of surface atoms. Ion scattering spectroscopy includes two 
representative types of which the one is LEISS (Low Energy Ion 
Scattering Spectroscopy) and the other is RBS (Rutherford Backscattering 
Spectroscopy). In general, LEISS utilizes low energy He⁺, Ne⁺ or Ar⁺ ions of the 
order of kilo electron volts or less, and RBS utilizes high energy H⁺ or 
He⁺ ions of the order of mega electron volts. LEISS is effective for 
analysis of one atomic layer at an outermost surface of a sample in a 
composition and geometrical position of surface atoms. On the other  
 
hand, RBS can analyze a sample from its top surface to deep into micro 
meters range. However, only mean values for relatively thick region of 
the order of a few ten nanometers can be obtained by RBS. In a prior art, in order to conduct precise analysis of a sample from 
its surface to a distance deep from its surface, the following process is 
repeated; analyzing the surface of the sample by LEISS, removing the 
analyzed atomic layers by an Ar ion milling or a reactive ion etching and 
then analyzing an exposed surface again by LEISS. However, according to the above conventional process, it is very 
difficult to conduct a fine control of a removed thickness from the surface 
of the sample in order of the atomic layer. Therefore, it is almost 
impossible to evaluate the sample precisely on distribution of composition 
from its surface with atomic layer accuracy. In addition, the exposed surface of the sample by sputtering or 
etching has a high potential and is chemically active so as to react easily 
with residual gases (the sputtering and etching are done with considerably 
higher pressure than LEISS). Therefore, the exposed surface of the 
sample is easily degraded with these gases so that the analysis tends to be 
present as meaningless data. Furthermore, crystal perfection may often 
be destroyed by the sputtering or etching and elements of the sputtering 
or etching gases or elements apart from surface may stick to the exposed 
surfac
