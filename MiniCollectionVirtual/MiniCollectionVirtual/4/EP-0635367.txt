<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the precision mounting of printing plates on the plate cylinder of printing machines. The printing plates to be applied precisely in register on a plate cylinder have U-shaped punch-outs at the leading edge of the printing plate, which cooperate with electrically retrievable register pins arranged on the clamping bar of the plate. The basic problem is to make it possible to record the zero position of the clamping bar of the plate assigned to the lead edge of print. The register pins (6) are mounted on the plate cylinder (1) so as to be pivotable in the circumferential direction; the basic position is fixed by a spring (10) and a stop (11). Cutouts are provided in the clamping bar (3) of the plate in the region of the register pins (6).

Device for register maintaining setting of printing 
plates on the plate cylinder of printing presses, 

particularly offset sheet printing presses, with a 
tensioning rail arranged in
 an axially parallel 
channel coordinated to the print start of the 

printing plate and adjustable in the peripheral 
direction with a grasping region for receiving and 

fixing the printing plate front edge, wherein the 
printing plate front edge has U-shaped stampings out 

which cooperate with register pins coordinated to 
the tensioning rail and which are electrically 

interrogatable, as well as an optical indicator 
switchable via the electrically interrogatable 

register pins, characterised in that the register 
pins (6) are installed swivellably on the plate 

cylinder (1) in the peripheral direction of the 
plate cylinder (1), that each register pin is 

coordinated with a spring (10) as well as a stop 
(11) fixed with respect to the cylinder, by means of 

which the register pins (6) take up in the 
peripheral direction a position defining the base 

position for register, and that in the tensioning 
rail (3), cutouts (12) are provided in the region of 

the swivellable suspension (7, 8) of the register 
pins (6) so that the register pins (6) are located 

in the grasping region for the printing plate (9) of 
the tensioning rail (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the electrically interrogatable register pins (6) 

are installed in each case via a mounting (8) fixed 
on the wall of the channel (2) of the plate cylinder 

(1) turned towards the print start having a swivel 
axle (7) in the form of a double armed lever and the 

spring (10) supported fixed with respect to the  
 

cylinder engages on the part of the register pin (6) 
turned towards the floor of the channel (2) and the 

stop (11) is arranged relative to the end of the 
register pin (6) towards the printing plate (9). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the stop (11) is constructed as an adjusting 

screw. 
Device according to one of the preceding Claims. 
characterised in that the optical indicator 

coordinated to the electrically interrogatable 
register pins (6) is installed in the outwards-facing 

end of the register pins (6). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the optical indicator in the outwards-facing end of 

the register pin (6) is constructed as a light-emitting 
diode (13).
