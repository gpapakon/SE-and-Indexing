<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an olefin
polymerization catalyst which comprises a modified clay, a
metallocene compound, and an organoaluminum compound. The
present invention also relates to an olefin polymerization
process employing the above catalyst.In production of polyolefins by polymerization of
olefin, catalysts are known which are constituted of a
combination of a transition metal compound and an
organometallic compound. Kaminsky, et al. disclosed that a
catalyst formed from a metallocene and methylaluminoxane has
high activity in polymerization of olefin including
propylene in JP-A (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
No.) 58-19309.The catalyst systems employed in the above patent
publications, although they have excellent activity for
polymerization, are used usually for solution polymerization
owing to the solubility of the catalyst in the reaction
systems. Further, in the catalyst system, the relatively
expensive methylaluminoxane needs to be used in a large
quantity to produce an industrially useful polymer, which
involves the disadvantages of high production cost and much
aluminum residue in the resulting polymer.On the other hand, JP-A-60-35006, etc. disclose
catalyst systems which comprise the aforementioned soluble 
catalyst supported on an inorganic oxide carrier like
silica. Such catalysts, however, do not have sufficient
polymerization activity per unit weight of
methylaluminoxane.To improve the activity per unit weight of
methylaluminoxane, JP-A-4-8704, JP-A-4-11604, and JP-A-4-213305,
for example, disclose a catalyst system containing a
metallocene and less methylalminoxane modified by
prepolymerization, for gas phase polymerization, which gives
a polymer having satisfactory particle properties with high
polymerization catalytic activity. However, the catalyst
activity was not sufficient, although the amount of
methylaluminoxane is reduced.In recent years, novel cocatalysts without
methylaluminoxane - like organoaluminumoxy compounds
are being investigated. For example, Japanese Kohyo-1-501950
and Japanese Kohyo 1-502036 disclose special boron
compounds as an effective cocatalyst. These boron
compounds, which have a complicated structure, do not solve
the problem of the cost.After comprehensive studies by the inventors of the
present invention to solve the above problems, it was found
that a highly active polyolefin polymerization catalyst is
obtained from a modified clay mineral having been treated
with a compound capable of introducing a cation into the
interspaces between
