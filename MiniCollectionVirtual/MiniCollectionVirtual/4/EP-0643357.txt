<ABSTRACT>
A text data to input and display, 
character by character, is looked up 

in a dictionary to find a unique 
line of text which represents the 

unique word and which includes the 
text data input (Fig. 1 and 2). 
If successful, the remainder of the 
text data to input is automatically 

supplemented from the dictionary 
(Fig. 2). 
Relevant words for the unique word 
in the dictionary may be shown for 

the selection to replace.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a text input method to lower the burden of text input
for an information processing and communication control system.A conventional text input method utilises abbreviations (e.g. 'assoc' for
'association') or shorthand words (e.g. 'e' for editing, '1' for loading). However, in such
conventional methods, it is necessary to remember the abbreviation and activate a function
to find the desired word by depressing a special function key, and its efficiency depends on
an operator's ability, as the operator has to remember all the characters of abbreviation or
shorthand words in a dictionary which correspond to those of data input for the successful
functioning to find a match.European Patent No EP-A-0 170 197, according to the description, discloses a
character input device, comprising keyboard means having at least a plurality of character
keys and a search key, text memory means for storing documents data consisting of a
plurality of words and word positioning data, search character data memory means, word
positioning data search means, keyword memory means, comparison means, and a central
processing unit, means for controlling the writing of the input character data in said text
memory means in the order of key operation, and means for controlling the writing of a
word, identical to the key word in said text memory means, in place of at least one
character data stored in said search character data memory means, as based upon the
discriminating result from said comparison means for indicating coincides.In the above mentioned character input device, when the operator inputs characters
to be searched, and operates the search key, a word having a starting portion corresponding
to the characters to be searched can be searched. The searched word is stored in the
memory as a new input word, and is displayed on the display device or the like. Therefore,
a previously stored word can be automatically inputted and stored in the memory, without
limitation as to the number of its characters, by operating the special-purpose search key. A 
special-purpose search key is, however, required.An object of the present invention is to achieve a target to eliminate such
deficiencies of the conventional methods.The applicant's method requires no special-purpose dictionary but it utilises a
standard dictionary, or a quasi-standard dictionary consisting of a line of text and an
original word, or a selective dictionary having a principal part of the standard dictionary
with an addition of the

<CLAIMS>
A text input method comprising:

a step for entering a line of text data, character by character, 91 a dictionary
step for storing a plurality of data consisting of a line of text data such as an

abbreviation or a shorthand, and associated word data in a dictionary;

   
characterised in that
 said associated word data contains one or more relevant words
and 
in that
 the method comprises;

a step for determining a unique line of text data in said dictionary which
includes said entered line of text data, without a further special key depression, at the time

of each character input;
a step for entering one or more additional character data and for determining
a unique word among plural relevant words which terminates with said entered data, or

which includes said entered data in the remaining part of word other than that was
successfully collated, without a further special key depression, at the time of each character

input; and
a step for replacing said entered line of text data with what was determined
by said step for determining said unique line of text data or by said step for determining

said unique word, without a further special key depression.
A text input method comprising:

a step for entering a line of text data, character by character,
a dictionary step for storing a plurality of lines of text data;
a step for identifying plural lines of text data with the same stem of word in
said dictionary each of which include said entered line of text data, entering one or more

additional character data; and determining a unique line of text data among said identified
plural lines of text data, which terminates with said entered data or which includes said

entered data in the remaining part of line of text data other than that was successfully
collated, without a further special key depression, at the time of each character input; 91 and a 

step for replacing said entered line of text data with what was determined by said
step for identifying and determining said unique line of text data, without a further special

key depression.
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the method comprises:

a step for entering a line of text data, and adding 1 to a data input counter,
character by character;
a dictionary step for storing a plurality of lines of text data with unique
position counts given to each line of text data;
a step for determining a unique line of text data with said unique position
count in said dictionary which is the same as the contents of said data input counter and

which

includes said entered line of text data, without a further special key depression, at the time
of each character input; and
a step for identifying plural lines of text data which includes said entered
line of text data, and determining a unique line of text data with said unique position count

in said dictionary which is the smallest or largest number among said identified lines of text
data, comparing said unique position count with the contents of said data input counter,

without being actuated by the depression of a special function key, at the time of character
input.
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the method comprises:

a step for determining a unique line of text data which has the same first and
last parts as those of said entered line of text data and which include some other data

between said first and last parts of said entered line of text data, regardless of the continuity
of said some other data to be equivalent while collating between said entered line of text

data and those in said dictionary, either from left to right comparison for said first part and its
following data or from right to left for the comparison of said last part and its preceding

data, without being actuated by the depression of a special function key, at the time of
character input
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the method comprises:

a step for determining said unique line of text data which has the same
leading part as said entered line of text data and which has the same end part as the

remaining part of said entered line of text data, without being actuated by the depression of
a special function key, at the time of data input.
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the method comprises:

a step for entering a line of text data consisting of a string of characters or
character strokes;
a dictionary step for storing a plurality of lines of text data consisting of a string of
characters or character strokes;
a step for determining a unique line of text data which includes said entered
line of text data or which includes the first data followed by some other data of the line of

text data to enter, without being actuated by the depression of a special function key, at the
time of data input; and
a step for replacing said entered line of text data with what was determined
by said step for determining said unique line of text data, or generating and outputting the

print image generated using said line of text data which was determined by said step for
determining said unique line of text data.
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein:

a step for determining a unique line of text data comprises determining a
predetermined number range of lines of text data in said dictionary;
a step for identifying and determining a unique word comprises determining
a predetermined number range of words data in said dictionary; and
a step for identifying and determining a unique line of text data comprises
determining a predetermined number range of lines of text data in said dictionary.
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the method comprises:
