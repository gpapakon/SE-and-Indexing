<ABSTRACT>
Vegetable cutter having a replaceable inclined sliding surface (4) which is arranged in front of the cutting knife and extends beneath the cutting edge of the knife for a distance equal to the width of the cutting gap. The casing is composed of two parts, having a lower part (16) which acts both as a support and as a container for the material to be cut. The two casing parts are connected to one another by means of a separable articulation (17).

<CLAIMS>
A universal cutter for vegetables and the like having a
sliding surface for guiding the produce to be cut, a knife

disposed in the sliding surface diagonal to the direction
of sliding that separates the sliding surface into two

parts, a cutting groove formed of the knife-edge and the
part of the sliding surface lying lower than the knife,

whereby the part of the sliding surface disposed in front
of the knife (1) is interchangable and defines an inclined

plane leading towards the the cutting groove,
characterised in that the part (4) of the sliding surface

disposed in front of the knife (1) consists of a part (2)
solid with the housing lying in the plane of the knife and

an interchangeable part (4) interposed between this solid
part (2) and the knife (1), and that the sliding surface

of the interchangeable part defines an inclined plane
leading evenly from the solid part (2) to the cutting

groove, and a housing that folds out to form a stand.
A universal cutter according to claim 1, characterised in
that the interchangeable part (4) has the shape of a

parallelogram, the angles of which correspond to the
diagonal position of the knife (1). 
A universal cutter according to claim 1, characterised in
that it has various interchangeable parts (4) with

differently inclined sliding surfaces which form cutting

grooves of different widths for producing sections of
different thickness.
A universal cutter according to claim 1, characterised in
that the interchangeable part has a series of knife-edges

(22) disposed vertical to the sliding surface with which
an incision is made in the produce to be cut before it is

cut by the knife-edge (7) in a direction vertical thereto.
A universal cutter according to claim 1, characterised in
that the housing consists of a cutting part and a support,

(16) associated therewith by means of a separable hinge
(18) for supporting the cutter in an inclined position.
A universal cutter according to claim 5, characterised in
that the support is adapted as a container (16) for the

cut produce.
