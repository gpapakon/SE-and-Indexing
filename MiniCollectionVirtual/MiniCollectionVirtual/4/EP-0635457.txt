<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of ZnS particles by wet-chemical precipitation from aqueous zinc salt solutions, with ZnS being precipitated on nuclei introduced into the precipitation solution. Nuclei having a controlled size and size distribution are obtained by the nuclei being added to the aqueous precipitation solution in the form of a water-soluble organosol containing the nuclei.

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing ZnS particles by wet-chemical precipitation 
from aqueous zinc salt solutions whereby ZnS is precipitated on nuclei introduced into 

the precipitation solution, characterized in that the nuclei of the aqueous precipitation 
solution are added in the form of an organosol which contains the nuclei and is soluble 

in water. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that nucleating reactants 
are added in a dosed quantity to a water-soluble organic solvent during a reaction time 

in the manufacture of the organosol. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the organosol 
is formed with dimethyl formamide (DMF). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the organosol 
is formed with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the organosol 
is formed with acetone. 
A method as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that for the preparation 
of the organosol Cu(II) acetate (free from water) is dissolved in dry DMF, in that a 

H
2
S/Ar mixture is introduced into this solution, and in that the solution is subsequently 
filtered. 
A method as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that for the preparation 
of the organosol N-dimethyl dithiozinc carbamate (C
6
H
12
N
2
S
4
Zn) is dissolved in dry 
DMF, in that H
2
S is introduced into this solution, which is subsequently filtered and 
added to an aqueous ZnSO
4
 solution, and in that subsequently a H
2
S/Ar mixture is 
introduced under vigorous stirring. 
A method as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that for the preparation 
of a sol of nuclei a saturated solution is prepared with sulphur and acetone, which 

solution is subsequently added to an aqueous ZnS solution. 
A method as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 8, characterized in 
that the organosol is added to an aqueous zinc salt solution for the wet-chemical  

 
precipitation of ZnS onto the nuclei, and in that subsequently a H
2
S/Ar mixture is 
introduced. 
A method as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that the ZnS particles obtained are dried into a powder and are subsequently processed 

into ZnS phosphors through heating under exclusion of oxygen with the addition of 
dopants and/or elementary sulphur.
