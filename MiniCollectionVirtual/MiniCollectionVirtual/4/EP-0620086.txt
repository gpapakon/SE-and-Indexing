<ABSTRACT>
A stapling plier has a magazine adapted to contain a supply of detachably interconnected 
staples, and resiliently biased driver and clincher arms pivotally connected to the magazine for 

movement between open and closed positions. The magazine has an exit throat and the driver 
and clincher arms are provided respectively with driver and clincher elements. An operating 

lever is pivotally connected to the clincher arm and has arcuate surfaces in sliding contact with 
complimentary arcuate surfaces on bearings journalled for rotation on the driver arm. Pivotal 

closure of the operating lever causes closure of the driver and clincher arms, with an 
accompanying ejection of a staple from the magazine by the driver element and a clinching of 

the thus ejected staple against the clinching element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fastener applying implements, and is concerned
in particular with an improved stapling plier according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a stapling plier is known from US-A-2574988. The stapling plier comprises a
magazine, a clincher arm, a drive arm and an operating lever. The drive arm operates a
driver and the magazine, clincher arm and the driver arm are pivotally connected to a
common axis defined by a pin. The operating lever is pivotally connected to the clincher
arm by another pin. The operating lever is also connected to the driver arm by means of
a pin journalled in bearings and carrying a roller designed to roll along an arcuate track in
the driver arm.From GB-A-823065, a further stapling tool is known.A well known and widely employed type of stapling pier is disclosed in
US-A-2,461,165 and US-A-2,354,760. A primary objective of the present invention
is to improve upon this known design by providing a smoother transmission of the
leveraged forces produced as a result of squeezing the operating lever while driving and
clinching a staple, thereby reducing the required operator effort involved.This object is achieved by a stapling plier according to claim 1.An advantage of the present invention is to simplify and facilitate assembly of the
plier components, thereby making it possible to realise important savings in
manufacturing costs.A further advantage of the present invention is to provide improved guidance and
support for the staples as they are being driven through various work elements.A companion advantage of the present invention is to facilitate the task of clearing
jammed staples from the exit throat of the magazine.In a preferred embodiment of the invention to be hereinafter described in greater
detail, a stapling plier is provided having a 
magazine adapted to contain an inverted channel-shaped assembly (commonly referred to as a
"stick") of U-shaped detachably interconnected staples, each staple having the conventional pair
of legs joined by an integral crown. A driver arm and a clincher arm are arranged to
respectively overlie and underlie the magazine. The rearward ends of the driver arm and the
clincher arm are connected to the rearward end of the magazine, the latter having an exit throat
at its forward end through which staples are driven into a work element gripped between the
underside of the magazine and the clincher arm. Staples are driven out of the magazine through
the exit throat by a driver carried on the driver arm. A clincher formed
