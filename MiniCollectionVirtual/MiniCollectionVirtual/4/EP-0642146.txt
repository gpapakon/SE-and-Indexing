<ABSTRACT>
Pressure switch is shown which is accommodated in a pressure 
vessel (1) filled with a gas at a first pressure (P1), such as 

for a safety air bag in a road vehicle. The device comprises a 
pressure container (12) filled with a gas at a second pressure 

(P2), which container has at one side a flexible diaphragm (18) 
which reacts to the difference in the two pressures and interacts 

with an electrical circuit. The container is fitted with one 
side adjacent to and opposite a wall portion (14, 106, 214, 238, 

256) of the pressure vessel and a magnetic element (16, 26, 240, 
246/248) is operatively coupled to the diaphragm. The wall 

portion of the pressure vessel is made of non-magnetic material, 
and near the other side of the wall portion a magnetic field 

sensitive switching element (40) is mounted opposite the 
diaphragm magnetic element. A window element (13) of magnetic 

material may be placed in the wall portion of non-magnetic 
material, in line with the magnetic element and the switching 

element. An armature (232, 254) extending through the wall 
portion may be used to concentrate the magnetic flux path. The 

armature can be arranged to function in a head-on mode (232) or 
on a slide by mode (254). The magnetic curve of the system can 

be adjusted by using a bias magnet (216). A two part assembly 
permits attachment of the switch to the vessel without problems 

associated with the heat of welding from adversely affecting 
associated electronics and a circuit (222) is shown for providing 

a two wire output having voltage levels indicative of selected 
conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to condition sensors and 
more particularly to such sensors used to sense fluid pressure in 
a vehicular air bag safety system. In such a system, typically a 
pressure switch device is accommodated in a pressure vessel 
filled with a gas at a first pressure, such as for a safety air 
bag in a road vehicle, and which comprises a pressure container 
filled with a gas at a second pressure, which container has at 
one side a flexible diaphragm which reacts to the difference in 
the two pressures and interacts with an electrical circuit. Such 
a pressure device is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,049,935. In the case of this known device, the pressure of the 
pressure vessel must be monitored accurately so that the normal 
operation of the pressure vessel, for example, for the immediate 
deployment of a safety air bag in a road vehicle, is assured for 
an extended period of time. For this purpose, a pressure 
container filled with a gas at a second pressure is disposed 
inside the pressure vessel. The flexible diaphragm at one side 
of the pressure container will move or snap between opposite 
positions under the influence of the magnitude of the pressure 
differential between the first and second pressures. An element 
which is movable at right angles to the face surface and aligned 
with the center of the diaphragm will in this case carry along a 
movable arm of a two-way switch into engagement with one or the 
other stationary contact thereof. The pressure switch serves to 
monitor the pressure inside the main vessel, and any leakage  
 
thereof, and the pressure in the pressure container during the 
service life of the device. The pressure container with the 
diaphragm and the associated switching contacts are disposed 
inside the pressure vessel, and the electrical connections from 
the contacts run out through the wall of the pressure vessel and 
are connected outside the vessel to an associated electrical 
circuit, for example, to give off an alarm. The connections are 
generally passed through the wall of the pressure vessel by way 
of a glass or plastic seal. Since the pressure inside the 
pressure vessel lies in a range of 200 to 400 bar at temperatures 
between -40° and +130° C, and since the pressure inside the 
pressure container has to be maintained over a very long service 
life (at least 10 years), such seals are not found to be 
sufficiently reliable. Since the present switch device is used 
for activating the above mentioned air bag in a road vehicle, 
such a
