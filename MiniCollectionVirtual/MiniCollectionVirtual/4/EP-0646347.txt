<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a device for reception of at least one sonography probe (12) which can be adjusted and fixed on the skull of a patient by means of a frame (10a) which can be attached thereto and on which the probe (12) rests adjustably in a probe mount (44). In this device, the frame (10a) resembles spectacles and comprises a bridge (55) and a pair of retaining brackets (16a) adjoining the bridge on either side. Two step-like supporting tongues (38, 38a) are mounted so as to be rotatable and longitudinally displaceable on each retaining bracket (16a) and they are connected to one another at one end via a yoke (42) hinged thereon, the yoke forming part of the probe mount (44). The distance between the bridge (55), on the one hand, and plug-like transverse pins (22) for fixation in the ear region, on the other hand, can be adjusted variably.

Device for receiving at least one sonography probe (12)
for the adjustment and fixing thereof on the skull of a

patient, comprising a frame which can be arranged thereon and
on which the probe (12) adjustably rests in a probe bearing

(44), 
characterised in that
 the frame (10, 10a), similar to a
pair of spectacles, comprises a nose piece (14, 55) and

holding pieces (16, 16a) adjoining it on either side, two
strip-like carrying tongues (38, 38a) rotatably and

longitudinally displaceably crossing each holding piece and
these carrying tongues being connected to one another at one

end by a yoke (42) articulated thereto and which is part of
the probe bearing (44), a respective stopper-like transverse

pin (22) projecting from the free ends of the frame (10, 10a),
the spacing between this and the nose piece (14, 15) being

variably adjustable and the stopper-like transverse pins (22)
each pointing to the other holding piece (16, 16a) of the

frame (10, 10a).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
carrying tongues (38, 38a) each comprise a slot (36) as a

guide for a bearing pin (30) of the holding piece (16, 16a)
and can be fixed thereto in a clamping manner.
Device according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the
spacing (n) of the bearing pins (30) from one another

approximately corresponds to the spacing of the articulation
points (40) of the yoke (42), or the bearing tongues (38, 38a) 

are adjustable in a parallelogram-like manner on the holding
piece (16, 16a) of the frame (10, 10a) with the yoke (42).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
nose piece (55) is arranged at an adjustable spacing (e) from

the frame (10a), the nose piece (55) optionally being part of
a screw element (54) penetrating the frame (10a) and/or a

spiral-toothed gear wheel (56) being rotatably mounted on the
frame (10a) and being penetrated by the screw element (54).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
holding piece (16) comprises a side portion (17) and is

extendable owing to a telescopic strip (20) which is
displaceably provided in parallel thereon and from the free

end of which the stopper-like transverse pin (22) pointing
coward the other telescopic strip projects.
Device according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that

the stopper-like transverse pin (22) determines, with the axis
of symmetry (A) of the frame (10), an angle (w) opening away

from the nose piece (14).
Device according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised
in that
 the holding pieces (16, 16a) and the side portions
(17) of the frame (10) extend offset in height (height h) from

the nose piece (14, 55).
Device according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised
in that
 two edge strips (60) of the holding pieces (16, 16a)
delimit a slot (62), the edge strips (60) optionally being

connected via rings (64) located in their plane or forming a
guide path for fixing devices (30, 72). 
Device according to at least any one of claims 1 to 8,
comprising a probe bearing (44) with an at least partially

spherical face for abutment on a correspondingly formed
sliding face of the probe which can be moved thereon, the yoke

(42) being part of the probe bearing (44) and the latter being
provided with a central recess (44a).
Device according to at least any of claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that
 the probe bearing (44) is constructed in
the manner of a ring with spherical side faces (43, 45), one

of these side faces being adjacent to the probe (12) and the
other being adjacent to the threaded ring (48) connectable to

the probe.
Device according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 probe
(12) and threaded ring (48) are connected by a tubular element

(47) and the latter can be displaced in the central recess
(44a).
