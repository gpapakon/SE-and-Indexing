<ABSTRACT>
A sample segment (10) including a body and wells (14) formed therein, selected wells (14b, 14f) including a flat exterior surface (56) surrounding a tapered end (64). The sample segment (10) may retain selected reagents (80), and a sealing cover (90) is held by ribs (74, 76), stretched and pressed against raised bosses (70) formed around the well openings (44) to provide a sure seal. The bosses (70) are discontinuous between adjacent wells (14). Selected wells may contain a free mixing element (82) for enhanced mixing. The segment (10) is uniquely adapted for automated handling and processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is related to the following
applications that are commonly assigned and filed
concurrently herewith:
US-A-5 356 525 ; US-A-5 417 925 ; US-A-5 605 666.The present invention relates to the field of sample
and reagent carrying devices, and more particularly to
sample carrying devices useful in automated analyzers.Various forms of sample carrying devices are known in
the art. For example US-A-3 713 985 (Astle)
describes a testing device which includes a plurality of
receptacles or wells interconnected integrally by a
horizontal support member. The device includes vertical
support members or legs and several of the receptacles
contain a range of biological control reagents in an
essentially dry form. The receptacles are sealed by a
sealing material such as plastic film or aluminium foil by
heat or pressure. Still other forms of devices are known for use on
automated analyzers. As an example, U.S. Patent No.
4,298,570 (Lillig) describes a tray section that has a
plurality of wells. The tray section is carried by a
turntable, which also receives sample containers. A sample
is pipetted from a sample container into a well in the tray
section, where additional dilutions of the sample are made.
The diluted samples are then taken by an automated pipette
to a reaction cell for analysis.As described in the concurrently filed application
US-A-5356525
entitled
"Sample Handling System", and identified above (and which is
not admitted to be prior art with respect to the present
invention by its mention in this Background), there is
disclosed in such Application a novel and inventive system
which is useful with a sample device or segment that is
moved about by the system to accomplish the required
analysis. However, neither the Lillig or Astle device is
suitable for use with such a system because, for example,
neither device includes structure that could be readily
gripped by a transport apparatus.Further, such system is adapted to be used in a
capillary electrophoresis analyzer that performs, for
example, immunosubstraction capillary electrophoresis
analyses. Such analyses require reagents, including liquid
reagents, to be stored in the device. Although Astle
describes a sealing material, sealing of the type of Astle
tends to allow leakage between adjacent reservoirs,
particularly with a liquid reagent, and thus would be
unsatisfactory for analytical techniques such as capillary
electrophoresis, particularly where adjacent reagents are
different.Reagent mixing within the reservoirs of a sample

<CLAIMS>
A sample segment (10) for use with an automated
analyzer

having transport means (98) comprising an arm (100) provided
with forks (102) at one end thereof, the sample segment

comprising a generally arcuate flange having a first surface (33a),
a second surface(33b), curved opposite edges (16,18) and an arcuate

center line (20); and a plurality of wells (14) formed
in the flange along said arcuate center line (20), the wells having exterior surfaces (50) and

exterior ends (52), each of the wells having an opening (44)
in the first surface of the body and defining an interior

volume (46); wherein at least two of the wells include
exterior flat surfaces (56) formed about exterior walls of

the at least two wells,

   the flat surfaces (56) are annular and face downwardly
in a direction parallel to an interior axial dimension (61)

of the at least two wells, and the flat surfaces (56) are
disposed substantially midway along the interior axial

dimension and between the first surface (33a) of the flange
and exterior ends (66) of the at least two wells, and

wherein the flat surfaces (56) are adapted for direct
engagement by the automated analyzer, so as to retain the

sample segment (10) in place in the automated analyzer,

   and, the sample segment further comprising an indexing rib (69a) between
the first surface (33a) of the flange and the exterior surface of a

selected well, wherein the indexing rib is adapted to locate the sample
segment with respect to supports on the automated analyzer.
A sample segment according to claim 1 further
comprising a raised rib (74) provided on the second surface

adjacent the edges (16, 18) of the body.
A sample segment according to claims 1 or 2 wherein the
sample segment (10) includes a second indexing rib (69b)

between the first surface of the body and the exterior of a
second selected well.

sample segment (10) includes a raised annular boss (70) on

the second surface of the body around the opening (44) of at

A sample segment according to claim 4 wherein the
sample segment further comprises a cover (90) that is

applied over the raised rib (74) and the boss (70), and is
sealed to the boss (70).
A sample segment according to claim 5 wherein the
dimension by which the raised rib (74) is raised with

respect to the second surface of the body is greater than
the dimension by which the boss (70) is raised with respect

stretched across the raised rib before the cover is pressed

and sealed against the boss.
A sample segment according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein the body comprises a flange (12) having first

wells (14) are formed in the flange (12), and wherein the

interior volume (46) of the wells is defined by a tapered
interior wall (47) and a rounded interior bottom (48), and

wells (14) are proximate the first surface of the flange.

claims wherein a free mixing element (82) is provided within

claims wherein the exterior surfaces (50) of the at least two

wells (14b, 14f) include exterior flat ends (56) and the exterior surfaces (50) of the
