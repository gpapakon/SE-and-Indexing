<ABSTRACT>
A plasma ion implantation apparatus (50) includes a vacuum 
chamber (52) that receives an object (70) to be ion implanted 

within its walls (66). The object (70) is supported upon an 
electrically conductive base (72) that is electrically isolated 

from the wall (66) of the vacuum chamber (52). An electrically 
conductive enclosure (74) is positioned between the object (70) 

and the wall (66) of the vacuum chamber (52) and supported upon 
the base (72). The enclosure (74) is made of an electrically 

conductive material. A plasma source (58) is positioned so as 
to create a plasma (68) in the vicinity of the object (70) to 

be implanted. A voltage source (78) applies an electrical voltage 
(-Vâ‚€) to be base (72) and thence the enclosure (74) relative 

to the wall (66) of the vacuum chamber (52). Secondary electrons 
(80) emitted from the object (70) during ion implantation are 

reflected back (82) to the plasma (68) by the enclosure (74), 
reducing X-ray production and improving plasma efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a plasma ion implantation apparatus
for plasma ion implanting an object, comprising a vacuum chamber
adapted for receiving the object within a wall of the vacuum
chamber, a plasma source positioned so as to create a plasma
in the vicinity of the object, and means for electrically biasing
the object to cause implantation of ions from the plasma.Such a plasma ion implantation apparatus is known from
EP-A-0 603 864. This document has been published after the
priority date of the present application and is, thus, a prior
art document under Article 54(3) and (4) EPC for the designated
contracting states Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Sweden.
It discloses a surface potential control in plasma processing
of materials. An electrically conducting grid is placed over
all or a portion of the surface of the object. This invention relates generally to the surface
treatment of materials by plasma ion processing, such
as plasma ion implantation, and, more particularly,
to improving the efficiency and safety of such
treatments.Ion implantation is a process wherein ions are
accelerated by an electrostatic potential to impact a
surface of an object. The energy of the ions causes
them to be imbedded beneath the surface. A
sufficient concentration of the implanted ions can
significantly increase the hardness of the surface.Ion implantation is traditionally accomplished
by creating a beam of ions and accelerating the ions
toward the surface by a sufficiently large
electrostatic potential. This approach, while
operable, is difficult to use on many large or
irregularly shaped objects, because the beam of ions
must be swept over the entire surface. Where the
surface has sharp curves, bores, points, or other
such features, a uniform implantation is difficult to
achieve.An alternative approach is plasma ion
implantation ("PII"), which is described in US Patent
4,764,394. The object to be implanted is placed into
a vacuum chamber. A plasma of ions is created
adjacent to the surface of the object to be
implanted. The object is electrostatically charged
to a potential opposite to that of the ions. For
example, if positively charged nitrogen ions are to
be implanted, the object is negatively charged using
repetitive, short-duration voltage pulses of 
typically about 50,000-300,000 volts (50-300
kilovolts). The nitrogen ions are attracted to the
surface of the object by this accelerating potential
and driven into the surface and sub-surface regions
of the object. Plasma ion implantation has the
advanta
