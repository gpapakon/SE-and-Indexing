<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing three-dimensional objects by the successive securing of superimposed layers of the object, the distortion of the object occurring by shrinkage during securing is reduced. To this end, first of all partial regions (6a...6k) of a layer are secured and thereby bonded to partial regions of the previously secured layer to form multi-layer cells, whereafter neighbouring partial regions of narrow securing regions (8a...8p) are secured together. The intermediate regions (7) between the individual partial regions are secured by post-curing.

Process for producing a three-dimensional object, 
in which the object (1) is generated by means of successive 

hardening of individual layers (2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e) 
in a bath of hardenable material by means of the action 

of an electromagnetic radiation, in each case firstly 
subregions (6a-6k) of a layer being hardened and, in so 

doing, being connected to subregions lying beneath them 
of the previously hardened layer to form multilayer cells 

(11a, 11b), then the subregions are connected to the 
adjacent subregions of the same layer by means of hardening 

narrow connecting regions between the subregions 
(6a-6k), in the form of connecting webs (8a-8p), and 

finally the intermediate regions (7) between the 
subregions (6a-6k) are hardened. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the connecting regions (8a-8p) are hardened only 

after a waiting time which corresponds to a shrinkage of 
the subregions by at least a predetermined amount. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the waiting time is between 5 and 100 seconds, 

preferably about 10 seconds. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the connecting regions (8a-8p) 

between adjacent cells in each layer are formed following 
the hardening of the subregions (6a-6k). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the connecting webs (8a-8p) between 

the cells (11a, 11b) are formed in a number of layers 
(2a-2e) which is smaller than the number of layers of 

cells (11a, 11b).  
 
Process according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that one or more connecting regions (8a-8p) are formed 

between adjacent subregions (6a-6k). 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, in order to enclose the intermediate 

regions, the subregions (6a-6k) are connected at 
the outer contour (5) of the object (1) by means of 

delimiting regions (9a-9f). 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the hardening of the intermediate 

regions (7) is carried out only after the hardening of 
the subregions (6a-6k) of all the layers of the object. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the distance between adjacent 

subregions (6a-6k) is of the order of magnitude of 1/20 
to 1/200, preferably 1/100, of the extent of the sub-regions 

(6a-6k). 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the lowest and the uppermost layer are in each case 

hardened as complete areas, so that these, together with 
the delimiting regions (9a-9f), form a completely closed 

surface on the outer contour (5) of the object (1).
