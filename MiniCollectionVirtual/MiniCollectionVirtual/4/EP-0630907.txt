<ABSTRACT>
A means for stabilizing a deproteinized natural 
rubber latex is disclosed, comprising adding a stabilizer 

selected from the group consisting of (a) an anionic 
surfactant, (b) an amphoteric surfactant, (c) a nonionic 

surfactant, (d) a nonionic or amphoteric oligomer or polymer, 
and (e) an anionic oligomer or polymer. By adding the 

stabilizer, the mechanical stability of a deproteinized 
natural rubber latex can be markedly improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a means for stabilizing a
deproteinized natural rubber latex.Natural rubber has hitherto been used widely as
industrial products, such as automobile tires, belts and
pressure-sensitive adhesives, and household goods, such as
gloves. These natural rubber articles are generally produced
by coagulating the rubber content of a natural rubber latex
to obtain raw rubber called crepe rubber or smoked sheet
rubber, and further processing the raw rubber through steps
of mastication, compounding of additives, molding, and
vulcanization.It was recently reported that medical tools made of
natural rubber, such as surgical gloves, various catheters,
and analgesic masks, provoke labored respiration or
anaphylactoid symptoms, such as vascular edema, nettle rash,
detelectasis and cyanosis, in patients. Cases were also
reported in which women with a history of allergy suffered a
pain in the hands, nettle rash or vascular edema around the
eyes when they used rubber gloves made of natural rubber.These symptoms seem to be attributed to the protein
present in natural rubber. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), U.S.A. has called on manufactures of natural rubber 
articles to reduce the protein content. It has therefore
been demanded to remove protein from natural rubber.Natural rubber is obtained from Hevea trees as a
latex containing a rubber content, water, protein, inorganic
salts, and other impurities. The latex oozing out from the
tapped trunk of a rubber plant is collected in a cup,
gathered at a refining factory where it is coagulated to
obtain raw rubber (crepe rubber or smoked sheet rubber) or
concentrated by centrifugation to obtain a purified latex.The protein content in natural rubber has usually
been expressed in terms of a nitrogen content (N %)
determined by a Kjeldahl method multiplied by 6.3. The
present inventors discovered that the proteins in raw rubber
obtained from a latex can be confirmed by infrared absorption
at 3280 cm-1 characteristic of polypeptide.The present inventors previously found that a
deproteinized natural rubber latex showing no IR absorption
at 3280 cm-1 can be obtained by a process comprising treating
a natural rubber latex with a protease and a surfactant
either simultaneously or successively and, after allowing the
system to stand for a given period of time, recovering the
rubber content by centrifugation (see Japanese Patent
Application Nos. 208754 to 208758/92 (corresponding to EP-A-0
584 597)).General natural rubber latex on the market are stable

<CLAIMS>
A method for stabilizing a deproteinized natural rubber latex comprising adding to
the deproteinized naturel rubber latex sodium polyoxyethylene (3) dodecyl ether sulfate or

an alkylbenzene sulfonate having an alkyl moiety of from 8 to 20 carbon atoms in an
amount to give a concentration of from 0.01 to 10% by weight based on the total weight of

the latex.
Use of sodium polyoxyethylene (3) dodecyl ether sulfate or an alkylbenzene
sulfonate having an alkyl moiety of from 8 to 20 carbon atoms as a stabilizer for a

deproteinized natural rubber latex.
