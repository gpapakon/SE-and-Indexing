<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible, 
composite, thermoplastic filament which contains 
endless (i. e., continuous) fibres and to the process 
for preparing it. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to a flexible, composite, thermoplastic filament 
constituted by fibre bundles of endless fibres of any 
kinds, whether mineral, or organic or metal fibres, 
impregnated with a thermoplastic powder and coated 
with an external flexible, thermoplastic sheath, which 
may either be of the same type, or of a different 
type, as of the thermoplastic component of the powder. In a large number of applications, heretofore 
dominated by the use of metal materials, composite 
materials were proposed which are constituted by a 
polymeric matrix and an inorganic reinforcer 
component, above all fibreglass or carbon fibres. 
Under conditions under which particularly high 
performance are required as regards the mechanical 
strength, long-fibre or, above all, endless-fibre 
composites are proposed. The first type of long-fibre or endless-fibre 
composite, developed as an alternative to the metal 
materials, was characterized by having a matrix 
constituted by thermosetting polymers, typical example 
of which are epoxy resins, unsaturated polyester 
resins and bismaleimides. Fabrication technologies for 
processing these type of materials were, and still  
 
are, preimpregnation and pultrusion. Both said technologies require that the fibres 
are caused to flow through suitable solutions of the 
thermosetting material, with consequent environmental 
problems and high process cost, owing to the need for 
managing the re-use and/or the storage of the used 
solvents. In order to obviate this type of drawbacks, more 
recently composite materials were introduced which use 
thermoplastic polymers as their matrix. In this case, 
the relevant fabrication technology implies, when the 
composite is a long- or endless-fibre one, the 
preliminary fabrication of a semifinished 
intermediate. An example of preparation of such a type of 
semifinished intermediate is reported in U.S. patent 
3,742,106; in which the formation of a composite by 
impregnation of a continuous reinforcer filament in a 
thermoplastic molten mass is disclosed. A further example of semifinished intermediate 
for composite with thermoplastic matrix is reported in 
Journal of Applied Polymer Science - Applied Polymer 
Symposium, vol. 47, p. 501, 1991, in which the 
preparation is described of an endless filament by 
spinning a mix constituted by

<CLAIMS>
Flexible, composite, thermoplastic filament, 
which contains endless fibres and is essentially 

constituted by a flexible sheath of a thermoplastic 
polymer which coats a fibre bundle of fibres 

impregnated with a thermoplastic powder, characterized 
in that said filament has an essentially elliptical 

cross section with d₁/d₂ lower than 1, wherein d₁ 
represents the minor diameter and d₂ represents the 

major diameter of said essentially elliptical 
section. 
Filament according to claim 1 having a fibre 
content of up to 70% by volume. 
Filament according to claim 1 or 2, in which 
the average diameter of the particles of the powder 

which impregnates the fibres is comprised within the 
range of from 10 to 100 micrometres. 
Filament according to any of the preceding 
claims, in which the flexible sheath which coats the 

fibre bundle is present in such a way as to have a 
weight ratio of the impregnating powder to the same 

sheath comprised within the range of from 1:2 to 2:1. 
Filament according to any of the preceding 
claims, in which the sheath is applied to the 

impregnated fibre bundle by coaxial extrusion through 
a tubular die the cross section of which has the 

geometrical shape of a rhombus with mean diagonals 
approximately equal to d₁ and d₂. 
Process for preparing the composite, 
continuous-fibre-containing filament according to any 

 
of the preceding claims, which comprises: 


(a) unwinding a continuous (endless) fibre bundle 
from a bobbin; 
(b) loosening the fibre bundle, in order to separate 
it essentially into its individual fibres; 
(c) impregnating the individual fibres with a 
thermoplastic polymer powder; 
(d) recompacting the fibre bundle and providing a 
flexible sheltering sheath around it, also made 

from a thermoplastic polymer, by causing the 
fibre bundle to coaxially run through a tubular 

die having its cross section of rhomboidal shape 
with mean diagonals equal to d₁ and d₂. 
Process according to claim 6, in which the 
loosening of the fibre bundle can be carried out by 

means of a mechanical system with small-diameter 
rollers of vibrating or pneumatic type. 
Process according to claim 6 or 7, in which 
the impregnation of the fibre bundle is carried out by 

causing the loosened fibre bundle to run through the 
powder kept under fluidized conditions inside a sealed 

chamber. 
Process according to claim 6 or 7, in which 
the impregnation of the fibre bundle is carried out by 

dipping and pulling the loosened fibre bundle through 
a stationary bed constituted by a thermpolastic 

polymer powder contained inside a tank submitted to 
continuous vibration.
