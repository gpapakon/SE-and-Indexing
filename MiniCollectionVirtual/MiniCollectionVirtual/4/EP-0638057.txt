<ABSTRACT>
In the production of bisphenol-A from the reaction of phenol and acetone, values are recovered from a "heavy ends" fraction by passing the fraction through a thin-film evaporator, making a light fraction which is fractionally distilled into three portions, two of which have recoverable proportions of bisphenol-A, and recovering bisphenol-A from at least one of them.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the production
of bisphenol-A and particularly to a method for the recovery of
values from the heavy ends in the production of
bisphenol-A by the reaction of phenol and acetone.The manufacture of
2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propane, or "bisphenol-A"
("BPA") by the reaction of phenol and acetone is
well known and practiced commercially. See U. S.
Patent 3,242,219 and French Patents 1,179,377,
1,342,760, and 1,353,609.Commonly produced in such manufacture is a
waste stream which may comprise at least 50%, and up
to about 90% (by weight) BPA. Because of the
difficulty heretofore of recovering the BPA from the
waste stream, it is generally burned along with the
waste or otherwise disposed of at minimal value.
In an HCl-catalyzed process, this stream typically
is 3-4% of total plant production. Such waste
streams may be produced, for example, in the
crystallization processes described in "Industrial
Crystallization for Ultrapure Products" by Charles
G. Moyers, Jr., CEP May 1986, pp 42-46, and in U. S.
Patent 4,209,646. We are not aware of a process similar to
ours which is designed to recover values from a BPA
waste stream such as we obtain in our plant, i.e.
having from 50-90% para-para BPA (p,p-BPA), 5-35%
ortho-para BPA (o,p-BPA) and 0-15% phenol, along
with 5 to 30% other, higher molecular weight
materials including about 3 to about 15% (based on
the whole composition) of a reaction product of
phenol and mesityl oxide,
2,2,4-trimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-chroman, which will
be referred to herein as "codimer" (see the
structural formula I below). Such a waste stream
may be assumed to be present in the bottoms of
column 13, described in the aforementioned U. S.
Patent 4,209,646, which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.Additional compounds, included in "other"
above, are 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-hydroxyphenyl-chroman
(II), the isopropenyl dimer (III), "bisphenol-X", or
trisphenol (IV), a spiro compound (V), a compound
which may be referred to as "4 ring A" (VI) and one
referred to as "4 ring B" (VII). Chroman is a
particularly troublesome impurity because its
boiling point is slightly lower than p,p-BPA, but
higher than o,p-BPA. U.S. Patent 4,954,661 teaches
some steps similar to the present invention, but it
is more complex and does not address the important
issue of codimer removal. 
It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved method
to recover values from a BPA waste stream.This object has been achieved
   by a method of recovering values
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of recovering values from a
waste stream in the production of bisphenol-A by the

reaction of phenol and acetone in a reaction zone,
said waste stream having a composition comprising

50-90% by weight p,p-bisphenol-A, 5% to
35% o,p-bisphenol-A, 0% to 15%

phenol, 3% to about 15% 2,2,4-trimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-chroman
and 5% to 30%

other materials, comprising (a) introducing said
waste stream into a thin-film evaporator to separate

a heavy stream therefrom and recover at least
70% of said waste stream in the form of a light

stream, (b) introducing said light stream to a
distillation tower to separate said light stream

into (i) a fraction comprising at least 70%
p,p-BPA, (ii) a fraction comprising at least

30% 2,2,4-trimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-chroman, and
(iii) a fraction comprising phenol and at least

40% o,p-BPA, and recovering the p,p-BPA values
from stream (i).
The method of claim 1 wherein fraction
(iii) is returned to said reaction zone for recovery

of BPA values therein.
The method of claim 1 including
introducing said stream (iii) into an isomerizer to

convert o,p-BPA to p,p-BPA, and recovering the
p,p-BPA values in fractions (i) and (iii). 
The method of any of claims 1 to 3 wherein said thin-film evaporator is a
wiped-film evaporator.
The method of claim 1 wherein said fraction (i) comprises at least 80%
BPA.
The method of claim 1 wherein said fraction (ii) comprises 30% to 60%
2, 2, 4-trimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-chroman.
The method of claim 1 wherein said fraction (iii) comprises 60% to 90%
o, p-BPA.
