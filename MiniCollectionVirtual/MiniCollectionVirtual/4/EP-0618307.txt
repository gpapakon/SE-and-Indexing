<ABSTRACT>
To a neutral electroless gold plating bath 
comprising a gold sulfite, a sulfite, and a 

reducing agent, there are added an organic 
phosphonic acid or a salt thereof and an 

optional stabilizer in the form of a non-ionic 
surfactant or non-ionic polymer. A gold 

plating film having an aesthetic lemon yellow 
color tone and susceptible to bonding deposits 

on an article from the bath without attacking 
the base material of the article and without 

plating spread.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electroless 
or chemical gold plating bath and more 
particularly, to an electroless gold plating 
bath suitable for forming a gold plating film on 
metal portions on printed circuit boards, 
ceramic IC packages, ITO substrates, IC cards, 
etc. For utilizing the advantages of gold 
including its physical properties such as 
electric conduction and thermal bonding ability 
and its chemical properties such as oxidation 
resistance and chemical resistance, electroless 
gold plating has heretofore been applied to 
terminals and circuit surfaces of electronic 
industry parts including printed circuit boards, 
ceramic IC packages, ITO substrates, and IC 
cards. Conventional well-known electroless gold  
 
plating baths are strongly alkaline baths 
containing cyanoaurates, caustic alkalis and 
boron hydrides. Because of strong alkalinity, 
however, these electroless gold plating baths 
undesirably attack the resist of printed circuit 
boards and aluminum nitride and glass material 
of IC packages. Inclusion of cyanide ion also 
gives rise to environmental protection difficulties. Also known in the art are neutral baths 
containing sulphites and hydrazines. Gold 
plating films resulting from these baths look 
discolored (a reddish color tone) to the naked eye 
because the films are of small and angular 
crystals. This crystallography also prevents 
the plating films from lending themselves to 
surface cleaning and gold wire bonding. Since 
the prevailing empirically-based view is 
that gold plating films having good 
function have an aesthetic lemon yellow color 
tone, these gold plating films of poor tone 
have poor commercial acceptability even when in fact they are 
susceptible to wire bonding. In addition, the neutral baths tend to  
 
incur plating spread, i.e. a coating also 
deposits at non - intended places, causing stains 
or blur. This tendency is exacerbated 
especially when plating a metal portion on 
a ceramic base, resulting in a plating film 
extending from the metal portion onto the 
surrounding ceramic base surface. Therefore, an object of the present 
invention is to provide an electroless gold 
plating bath which can form a gold plating film 
having an aesthetic lemon yellow color tone and 
susceptible to wire and die bonding without 
attacking the resist of printed circuit boards 
and aluminum nitride and glass material of IC 
packages and without giving rise to the problem 
of plating spread. Starting from a neutral electroless gold 
plating bath comprising a
