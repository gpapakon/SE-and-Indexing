<DESCRIPTION>
 HISTAMINE DERIVATIVES AND METHODS FOR THEIR USE AS IMMIJNOMODULATORS _FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates generally to methods for modulating the immune system of mammals and more particularly to methods of modulating the immune system using compositions comprising histamine derivatives.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONWith the increased level of understanding concerning the immune response . process in mammals, there is a growing awareness that certain molecules play a significant role in immune modulation. Unfortunately, these molecules are generally nonspecific as to their effects on single cell types in a mixture of cells. A critical need exists for agonists that are effect or cell specific.Histamine is a small molecule that has been shown to have a significant role in the immune response process in mammals. However, its ubiquitous effects on many cells that have receptors for histamine limits its possible immunotherapeutic use. Histamine derivatives that are tissue directed or effect specific would significantly aid in determining the role of histamine in immune modulation and produce valuable immunotherapeutics.Histamine can substantially modulate models of immune responses in mammals, particularly models of delayed hypersensitivity and T and B cell functions. Histamine is synthesized during different phases of response to antigen and is able directly or indirectly to effect further responses to antigen. It is possible that the concentration of histamine in tissue during inflammation and immune response can modify the function of a number of lymphoid cells. Although these effects may be substantial, the direct effect on single cell types in a mixture of cells cannot be determined unless the agonists are effect or cell specific. Ubiquitous effects of agonists on all cells that have receptors for histamine would limit any immunotherapeutic use of histamine. See Khan, et al., Clin Immunol. Rev. (1985) 4:1 Melmon. et al.. Am. J. Med (1981) 71:100: and Roclin et al. Cell Immunol. (1978) 37:162. 

 Histamine is an autacoid as are catecholamines. prostaglandins and some peptides. e.g., bradykinin and probably lymphokines. Autacoids differ from hormones in that they are made at their local sites of action and they can be made in a variety of tissues. Autacoids play an important role in mediating inflammation..- During inflammation, certain events may occur which include: protein denaturation. lowering of local pH, release of "new peptides" and lysosomal enzymes, and the like. Such events create a
