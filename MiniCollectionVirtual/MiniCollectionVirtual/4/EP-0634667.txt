Small monopulse radar, consisting of a high-frequency subassembly, which is
disposed in a housing and which is composed of two mixers and an oscillator, wherein the

mixers and the oscillator are interconnected as well as each connected with a respective
antenna, characterised in that


the high-frequency subassembly is constructed on a substrate (70); and
a respective waveguide (111, 112, 113) is placed on each of the mixers (21, 22)
and the oscillator (30).
Small monopulse radar according to patent claim 1, characterised in that the
waveguide main axes of the waveguides (111, 112, 113) extend parallel to one another.
Small monopulse radar according to patent claim 2, characterised in that a
respective waveguide short-circuit (121, 122, 123) is mounted on the rear side, which is

opposite the waveguides (111, 112, 113), of the substrate (70) directly under the mixers
(21, 22) and/or the oscillator (30) and that the main axes of the waveguides (111, 112,

113) and the associated waveguide short-circuits (121, 122, 123 preferably coincide.

individual waveguide short-circuits (121, 122, 123) are realised by respective blind bores.
Small monopulse radar according to one of the preceding patent claims,
characterised in that signal and supply voltage lines are led out from the high-frequency

subassembly over the substrate rear side.
Small monopulse radar according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that a respective dielectric radiator (101, 102, 103) is fixed at the output of each of the

individual waveguides (111, 112, 113). 
Small monopulse radar according to patent claim 6, characterised in that at least
one plano-convex lens (500) is arranged in the radiation field of the dielectric radiators

(101, 102, 103).
Small monopulse radar according to according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a respective horn antenna (1010, 1020, 1030) is mounted at the

output of each of the individual waveguides (111, 112, 113).

lenses (501, 502, 503) are fixed in the radiation field of the individual horn

antennae (1010, 1020, 1030) at about the position of their maximum clear width.
Small monopulse radar according to patent claim 9, characterised in that at least
one optical correction wedge (511, 513) is realised on at least one of the plano-convex

lenses (501, 502, 503).
Small monopulse radar according to according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the waveguides (111, 112, 113) are circular waveguides or

waveguides with elliptical cross-section.
