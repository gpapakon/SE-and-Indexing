<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the treatment of textile material, especially woven or knitted textile material, in which the textile material is subjected to direct ultrasonic radiation in a liquid medium, in that it is guided past the radiating surface of at least one ultrasonic transmitter, it is proposed to guide the textile material repeatedly in the form of an endless strand through a pipe, through which the liquid medium flows and in the wall of which the or each ultrasonic transmitter is installed, with a radiating surface directed into the pipe interior. The apparatus for carrying out the method comprises at least one ultrasonic transmitter, the radiating surface of which is arranged in the liquid medium, and a transport device for guiding the textile material past the radiating surface or radiating surfaces, and is characterised in that the or each ultrasonic transmitter (5) is installed in the wall of a preferably essentially horizontally arranged pipe (4) through which the liquid medium (2) flows, with the radiating surface (11) directed into the pipe interior, and in that the textile material (8) can be guided continuously in the form of an endless strand through the pipe (4) by means of the transport device (6, 7).
