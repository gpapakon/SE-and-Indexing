<DESCRIPTION>
 AN IMPROVED PROCESS FORPREPARING DINITROTOLUENEThis invention relates to an improved continuous process for preparing dinitrotoluene by reacting nitric acid with toluene. The improved process utilizes the circulating stream of reactor liquor to provide a heat sink for the fast and highly exothermic nitration reaction.Nitration reactions of aromatic hydrocarbons are generally conducted in mixed acid systems, such as mixed nitric and sulfuric acids. However, these mixed acid systems usually involve reconcentration of the spent sulfuric acid after the nitration reaction. This reconcentration step is time consuming, energy intensive and requires the use of expensive materials of construction. In addition, the use of sulfuric acid tends to result in significant nitrocreosol and cyanide by-product formation which requires expensive waste- water treatment to remove. 

 In view of these disadvantages associated with mixed nitric/sulfuric acid systems, there have been recent attempts to perform gas phase or liquid phase nitrations in concentrated nitric acid in the absence of sulfuric acid. By way of illustration:U.S. Patent No. 3,928,395 describes a process for nitrating unsubstituted or substituted benzene at a reaction temperature of -40°C to 80°C using 90% to 100% nitric acid in the optional and preferred presence of a dipolar aprotic solvent, wherein the reaction is halted by means of a dipolar aprotic solvent.U.S. Patent No. 3,957,889 describes an improved process for nitrating toluene or ortho-xylene with nitric acid, the improvement being enhancing the rate of the nitration reaction by carrying it out in the presence of at least an effective amount of anhydrous calcium sulfate or soluble anhydrite.U.S. Patent No. 4,064,147 describes the preparation of aromatic mononitro compounds (such as mononitrobenzene) by a liquid phase reaction with nitric acid having an acid concentration of between 70% and 100% by weight using a reaction temperature of between 0βC and 80°C. When employing a relatively reactive compound such as benzene or toluene as a starting material, this patent teaches that a nitric acid concen¬ tration of between 70 and 90% by weight is preferred. The process of this patent requires a ratio of nitric acid plus water to organic components of not below 3 when using 70% nitric acid, and not below 8 when using 100% nitric acid. However, it has now been found that such a high acid ratio using 100% nitric acid tends to favor dinitro-compound production, not desired by the process of the patent.

<CLAIMS>
What Is Claimed Is:
1. A continuous improved one pot process for the production of dinitrotoluene by a nitration reaction characterized by injecting toluene into a circulating reactor liquor consisting essentially of nitric acid and water, said reactor liquor providing a heat sink for the nitration reaction, said nitration reaction being conducted at a temperature of between about 0 C and about 90°C employing a molar ratio of nitric acid to toluene of between 12:1 and 9:1, said toluene being injected into said reactor liquor in a volume ratio of between 1:100 and 1:50 based upon the volumte of said reaction liquor.
2. The process of claim 1 characterized in that it is carried out at a reaction temperature of between about 40°C and about 70°C to produce an effluent mixture of dinitrotoluene, water and unreacted nitric acid, and wherein said effluent mixture is mixed with a nitrate salt to cause phase separation of the dinitrotoluene from the effluent mixture.
