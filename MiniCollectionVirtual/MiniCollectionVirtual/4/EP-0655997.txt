<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of starting materials for use in the 
synthesis of quinolone antibacterial agents. More particularly, the invention relates to an 
improved process for preparing 2-chloro-4,5-difluorobenzoic and 2,4,5-trifluorobenzoic 
acids by selective nucleophilic substitution of halonitrobenzenes. Halo-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives and 
their corresponding naphthyridines (hereinafter quinolones) are known to be effective 
antibacterial agents for human and animal use (see, for example, United States Patent No. 
4,730,000). Typical starting materials used in the synthesis of such quinolones include 
halo-substituted benzoic acids and their corresponding esters and acetophenones. It has 
been found, however, that known methods of preparing these compounds suffer from a 
number of drawbacks, including the need for expensive or hard-to-obtain reagents; 
materials hazards such as those associated with the use and decomposition of diazonium 
salts; and reactions having commercially undesirable selectivities and/or yields. In particular, 2-chloro-4,5-difluorobenzoic acid (CDFBA), 2,4,5-trifluorobenzoic 
acid (TFBA) and their respective analogous acetophenones are advantageous starting 
materials for quinolone synthesis. Preparations of these compounds have been described 
in United States Patent No. 4,833,270, issued May 23, 1989, and in the German Laid-Open 
Patent Application DE 38 40 371, published May 31, 1990. There remains, 
however, a need for a process offering an improved means of obtaining these and related 
quinolone precursors. Preparation of the above such compounds has also been disclosed 
in WO 93/09077 which is considered prior art under the terms of 
Article 54(3) and (4) EPC. Accordingly, a new process is disclosed for the preparation of halobenzoic acids, 
and especially CDFBA and TFBA, from halonitrobenzenes, which are relatively 
inexpensive and are readily available. In one aspect of the present invention is disclosed a 
method for preparing pyridinium intermediates which comprises the step of 
reacting a halonitrobenzene of the formula 
  
 
with a pyridinium salt of the formula 
 
to form an intermediate of the formula 
 
In the above formulae, R may be hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, -CN, -COOR' 
or -COR' where R' is alkyl or aryl; X may be chloro or fluoro; Y may be hydrogen, chloro 
or fluoro; and Z may be chloro, bromo or iodo. Preferred embodiments of this inventive 
aspect include the process in
