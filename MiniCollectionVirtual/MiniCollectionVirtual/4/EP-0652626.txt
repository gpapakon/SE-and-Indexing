<ABSTRACT>
An electrical generator assembly for a vehicle 
comprises an alternator having a rotary shaft (10) driven by 

the vehicle's internal combustion engine. An electrically-operated 
clutch assembly (15) disconnects rotary drive to the 

alternator when a sensor senses that the vehicle's throttle is 
at or near to full-throttle position, so as to increase the 

power available to the vehicle's transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical generator 
assembly, and more particularly to an electrical generator 
assembly for a vehicle. Vehicles generally comprise an alternator driven by a 
V-belt from the engine, which generates electricity when the 
engine is running. These alternators consume only a small 
proportion of the engines output power i.e. 1Â½ - 2 hp, however 
in small engined vehicles and in racing vehicles this power 
consumption can be significant. We have now devised an electrical generator assembly 
which alleviates the above-mentioned problem. In accordance with this invention there is provided an 
electrical generator assembly comprising a rotary electrical 
generator device and a transducer for sensing an operating 
parameter of an element connected to the generator device, and 
disabling means for disabling an output current from the 
generator device within a range of said operating parameter. It is well known that the force or power required to 
rotate the armature of a rotary electrical generator device is 
directly proportional to the current and voltage generated, 
therefore the force or power can be reduced to disabling the 
output current from the device. In one embodiment the disabling means for disabling the 
output current may comprise a mechanical linkage which 
disengages the rotary drive to the generator device within said 
range so that no current is generated. Preferably the mechanical linkage comprises a clutch 
coupled to a rotary input shaft of the device and operated by 
electrical signals from said transducer. In an alternative embodiment the disabling means 
comprises a switch which open-circuits the generator device 
within said range of the operating parameter. The switch may be connected in series with the 
electrical output from the generator device. Preferably the 
switch is connected in series with an electrical winding of the 
generator device.  In the case of vehicle alternators, the transducer may 
be arranged to inhibit the magnetic field excitation current 
of the alternator at times when maximum engine power is 
required e.g. when accelerating or when at or near to full 
throttle. Thus the transducer may comprise an accelerometer, 
or a sensor coupled to the throttle or to a rotational shaft 
of the engine. Alternatively the transducer may monitor the state of 
charge of the vehicle's battery so as to enable the generator 
device only at times when its state of charge falls below a 
predetermined level. Embodiments of this invention will now be
