<ABSTRACT>
A mattress (10) consisting of a one-piece foam-plastic body has at its longitudinal-side faces (20, 22) mutually opposite regions (e-f-q, h-g-r) of higher compressive strength which serve as sitting regions and stabilise a sleeping position in the mattress centre. In addition, the mattress (10) comprises in its interior a region (26) of reduced compressive strength and thus provides a shoulder depression for sleeping in the lateral position. A profiled lying zone (28, 30) on the lying area (12) of the mattress (10) ensures good ventilation of the sleeping person. By a gradual increase in the mattress thickness from the hip-back support region (e-f-g-h) up to the transverse-side face (18) close to the feet, the circulation of the sleeping person is promoted.
