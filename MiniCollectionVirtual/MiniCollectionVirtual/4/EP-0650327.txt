<ABSTRACT>
A biscuit (12) that has been produced by baking a short biscuit dough contains an edible particulate material, at least a substantial proportion of which material has a particle diameter of not less than 1 mm, the biscuit (12) having a diameter of at least 40 mm, and the biscuit (12) being formed with at least one aperture (13), the area of the aperture(s) (13) constituting at least 10 % of the area of the biscuit (12) including the area of the aperture(s)), and the size, configuration and location of the aperture(s) (13) being such that zones adjacent to the periphery of a surface of the biscuit (12) or adjacent to the edge of the or each aperture (13) overlap to such an extent that the total area of overlap of different zones, excluding any connected area of overlap having an area less than 10 mm2 is not less than 15 % of the total area of the biscuit (12) (including the area of the aperture(s) (13)).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to biscuits and, in 
particular, to biscuits having apertures. The invention 
further relates to a method for making the biscuits. International Patent Specification No. WO86/04292 
describes a food cutter for cutting food, in particular, 
fruit and vegetables, into ornate configurations. The food products with which the present invention 
is concerned are of the kind generally referred to as 
"biscuits" in the United Kingdom and are so referred to 
throughout the specification. It will be understood, 
however, that such food products may be referred to as 
"cookies" in some countries, including the USA. Previously, biscuits have been formed with apertures 
either for purely aesthetic reasons, that is, to make the 
biscuits appear attractive to a person who might buy or 
eat them, or for the purpose of providing means for the 
escape of gases formed on baking. In the latter case, 
pins are pushed through the biscuit dough while it is 
being shaped into a biscuit shape. The apertures so 
formed tend to close up at least in part on baking. 
The formation of apertures to allow the escape of gases 
during baking is generally referred to as "dockering". The invention provides a biscuit that has been 
produced by baking a short biscuit dough, the biscuit 
containing at least 7% by weight, and based on the total 
weight of the biscuit, of an edible particulate material  
 
having a particle diameter of not less than 1 mm, the 
biscuit having a diameter of at least 40 mm, and the 
biscuit being formed with at least  
 
one aperture, the area of the aperture or the total area 
of the apertures constituting at least 10% of the area of 
the biscuit (including the area of the aperture or 
apertures) and the size, configuration and location of 
the apertures being such that zones (as hereinafter 
defined) adjacent to the periphery of a surface of the 
biscuit or adjacent to the edge of the or each aperture 
overlap to such an extent that the total area of overlap 
of different zones, excluding any connected area of 
overlap having an area of less than 10 mm2 that does not 
form part of a connected area of 10 mm2 or more 
(hereinafter referred to, except in the claims, as a 
"connected area of overlap having an area of less than 
10 mm2"), is not less than 15% of the total area of the 
biscuit (including the area of the aperture or apertures). Biscuits in accordance with the invention have an 
attractive texture as compared with other biscuits. In 
particular, as a result of the

<CLAIMS>
A biscuit that has been produced by baking a short 
biscuit dough, the biscuit containing at least 7% by 

weight, and based on the total weight of the biscuit, of 
an edible particulate material, which particulate 

material was incorporated with the dough before baking, 
at least a substantial proportion of the particulate 

material having a particle diameter of not less than 
1 mm, the biscuit having a diameter of at least 40 mm, 

and the biscuit being formed with at least one aperture, 
the area of the aperture or the total area of the 

apertures constituting at least 10% of the area of the 
biscuit (including the area of the aperture or apertures), 

and the size, configuration and location of the 
apertures being such that zones adjacent to the periphery 

of a surface of the biscuit or adjacent to the edge of 
the or each aperture and defined by a notional line 

drawn, respectively, within, and spaced by a distance of 
7 mm from, the periphery and a notional line drawn 

around, and separated by 7mm from, the edge of the or 
each aperture overlap to such an extent that the total 

area of overlap of different zones, excluding any 
connected area of overlap having an area less than 10 mm
2
 
that does not form part of a connected area of 10 mm
2
 or 
more, is not less than 15% of the total area of the 

biscuit (including the area of the aperture or 
apertures).  

 
A biscuit as claimed in claim 1, wherein the area 
of the aperture or the total area of the apertures 

constitutes from 13 to 30% of the area of the biscuit. 
A biscuit as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
the tota
l area of overlap of different zones, excluding

having at least one aperture, and 
(iii) baking the dough piece,

step (i) being such that the cooked biscuit contains 
particles of the particulate material, a substantial 

proportion of which are of diameter not less than 1 mm, 
and the dimensions and configurations of the dough piece  

 
and the aperture or apertures formed in step (ii) being 

such that, in the baked biscuit, the area of the aperture 
or the total area of the apertures constitutes at least

location of the apertures is such that zones adjacent to 
the periphery of a surface of the biscuit or adjacent to
