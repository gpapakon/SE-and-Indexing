<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide emulsion comprising 50% to 100% of 
projected area of all silver halide grains are occupied 

by hexagonal tabular silver halide grains which have an 
aspect ratio of 8 to 40, which have a ratio of the 

longest side to the shortest side of 1 to 2, and which 
have an average silver iodide content of 2 mol% to 

10 mol%, and all silver halide grains have a grain size 
of variation coefficient of 8% to 20%. A method of 

preparing the emulsion described above, comprising a 
nucleation step and a grain-growing step and in which a 

dispersant used in the nucleation step is low-molecular 
gelatin having a molecular weight of 5,000 to 25,000, 

and nucleation time t (seconds) in the nucleation 
step satisfies the relationship of 1 
<
 t 
<
 -T+90, where 
T (°C) is a temperature of a reaction vessel at the time 

of the nucleation step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing a tabular silver
halide emulsion which is useful in the field of
photography.Tabular silver halide grains having parallel
twin planes (hereinafter referred to as "tabular
grains") have the following photographic properties:
1) Since they have a large ratio of the surface area
to the volume (hereinafter called "specific surface
area"), a great amount of a sensitizing dye can be
adsorbed to their surface. As a result, they have
color sensitized-sensitivity which is high relative
to their intrinsic sensitivity.2) When an emulsion containing the tabular grains is
coated and dried, the planes of the grains are arranged
in parallel on the surface of a support, whereby the
coated layer can be so thin that sharpness is good.3) In the case of same sensitivity, the amount of
silver coated can be smaller than in the case of using a
non-tabular grain emulsion, and the sensitivity/
graininess ratio is therefore high.4) They are highly resistant to natural radiation.Having these many advantages, the tabular grains
have hitherto been used in commercially available
materials.An ideal feature which tabular grains must have
to demonstrate their advantages fully is high aspect 
ratio. Tabular grains having a high aspect ratio,
however, will have the following defects if prepared by
the known method.
1) They have a broad distribution of diameter of
projected area.2) The tabular grains exist along with bar-shaped
ones, tetrapod-shaped ones, ones having single twinning,
or ones having non-parallel twin planes.3) Hexagonal tabular AgX grains (hereinafter called
"hexagonal tabular grains") and triangular tabular AgX
grains (hereinafter called "triangular tabular grains")
exist together as the tabular grains.Therefore, the tabular grains are disadvantageous
in the following respects:
1) They cannot be expected to achieve hard gradation
(i.e., so-called high gamma) in a characteristic curve.2) When they consist of large ones and small ones,
optimal chemical sensitization cannot be performed on
them since the best conditions for chemical
sensitization of the large ones differ from those for
chemical sensitization of the small ones.3) Since hexagonal tabular grains and triangular
tabular grains exist together, they have non-uniform
chemical-sensitization characteristic since these types
of grains differ in chemical sensitization readiness.4) The portion of the largest diameter of a hexagonal
tabular grain is 1.23 times greater than that of the
largest diameter of a triangular

A process for producing a silver halide emulsion,
comprising:


(1) reacting silver ions and halide ions by combining a
silver nitrate aqueous solution with a halide salt aqueous

solution in a reaction vessel, so as to form tabular silver
halide grain nuclei; and
(2) growing said grain nuclei to form a silver halide
emulsion having a grain size variation coefficient of 8% to

20% and wherein 50% to 100% of said silver halide grains,
based on projected area, are hexagonal tabular silver halide

grains which have an aspect ratio of 8 to 40, an average
silver iodide content of 2 mol% to 10 mol%, and a ratio of the

longest side to the shortest side of grain of 1:1 to 2:1;

characterised by

carrying out said reaction step (1) of silver ions and
halide ions to form tabular silver halide grain nuclei in the

presence of a low-molecular weight gelatin having a molecular
weight in the range of 5,000 to 25,000; and
forming said grain nuclei in said reaction step (1) within
a nucleation time t (seconds) starting from combining said

silver nitrate aqueous solution with said halide salt aqueous
solution, wherein said time t satisfies the relationship 1 
<
 t

<
 -T + 60 where T (°C) is the temperature of the reaction
vessel at the time of reaction step (1) and T lies in the

range 20-45°C.
