<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flat type
image display apparatus which is to be used in a
television receiver and a display unit for computers or
the like.In recent years, a color image display apparatus
has been developed for achieving a compact size
vigorously.In an electron beam scanning type of the color
image display apparatus, a flat type image display
apparatus is disclosed in the unexamined published
Japanese application (TOKKAI) HEI 3 - 67444. Such flat
type image display apparatus is generally characterized as
follows:
(1) A distance between a cathode and an anode is
remarkably shorter than that of a conventional cathode-ray
tube type.(2) A fluorescent screen is divided horizontally
and vertically into the matrix arrangement of plural small
segments, and each of the small segments is scanned by
deflecting one electron beam which is separated from the 
other electron beams.(3) Fluorescent dots of R (red), G (green) and B
(blue) for one picture element in the small segment are
shot in turn by the electron beam of which an amount of
the irradiation is controlled by color picture signals.(4) Television moving pictures as a whole are
reproduced on the fluorescent screen by arranging all
small segments.The flat type image display apparatus generally
comprises a flat box-shaped vacuum case including plural
linear hot cathodes and a flat-shaped electrode unit.
Each linear hot cathode (hereinafter referred to as
"linear cathode") serves as a generator of the electron
beam. The flat-shaped electrode unit has plural holes and
plural slits for deflecting, focussing and controlling the
electron beam. The electron beam emitted from each linear
cathode passes through the holes and the slits. Thereby,
the electron beam reaches the fluorescent screen via the
above-mentioned steps of deflecting, focussing and
controlling. As a result, the fluorescent screen emits
light, and a television moving picture is reproduced on
the fluorescent screen.A concrete construction of the general flat type
image display apparatus will be elucidated with reference
to FIG.8, FIG.9 and FIG.10. In the description of the
prior art, a horizontal direction is shown by an arrow "X" 
of FIG.8, and a vertical direction is shown by an arrow
"Y" of FIG.8. FIG.8 is a perspective view showing the
flat type image display apparatus. FIG.9 is a cutaway
perspective view, which is taken on line IX - IX of FIG.8,
showing a part of the flat type image display apparatus.

construction of a
