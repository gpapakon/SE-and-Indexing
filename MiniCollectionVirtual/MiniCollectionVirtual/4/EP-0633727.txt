<ABSTRACT>
When producing a fat product containing milk fat with a reduced fat content cream is concentrated to a cream product with a fat content of at least 75 % in a centrifugal separator. The cream product is mixed with vegetable oil in an amount of 0-50 % of the total amount of fat in the fat phase which is obtained consisting of cream product and vegetable oil. The fat phase is mixed with a desired amount pasteurized water containing stabilizing means, preferably gelatin, salt and aroma substances. The temperature is kept between 50-80  DEG C during the last mentioned mixing operation. The obtained mixture is cooled and worked such that phase reversal takes place. The obtained end product consists of a stable water-in-oil-emulsion. The product has a fat content of 25-60 % and contains only emulsifiers occurring originally in the cream. The casein content of the product is below 2 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method of Producing a Fat Product Containing Milk Fat.The present invention relates to a method of producing a fat product containing milk fat with a reduced fat con¬ tent.The interest for fat products based on milk fat or mix¬ tures of milk fat and vegatable oil is increasing. Up to the present one has often started with butter oil poss¬ ibly mixed with vegetable oil in which fat mixture a water phase is admixed. The water phase may contain casein or caseinate, skim milk powder or milk protein, whey protein and possibly gelatin.The dry solid content in the water phase which is mixed with the fat phase has been high in order to bind the water in a sufficient degree so that the end product, a water-in-oil emulsion shall be stable and not give off free water.Processes have also been presented for producing pro- ducts with a low fat content starting from butter, where a water phase is admixed into earlier produced butte* <, Such processes are described for example in WO 91/07098 and in EP 368805.Later there has also been published patent applications which describe processes where products containing milk fat are produced starting from cream without any chur¬ ning step. In EP 376407 there is described a fat product produced from water, melted vegetable oils and cream, Similar processes are described also in EP 385542 and EP 445857. In order to obtain stable emulsions emulsifiers are added to the mixture of cream, vegetable fat and water prior to the phase reversal. 

According to the invention there is now proposed a method to produce a fat product containing milk fat with reduced fat content, which fat product is a stable water-in-oil-emulsion free from added emulsifiers.The method according to the invention is mainly charac¬ terized in that cream is concentrated to a cream product with a fat content of at least 75 % in a centrifugal separator. In connection with the said concentration this cream product is mixed with vegetable oil in an amount of 0-50 % of the total amount of fat in the fat phase which is obtained consisting of cream product and vegetable oil. The fat phase is mixed with the desired amount of pasteurized water phase containing stabilizing means, preferably gelatin, salt and aroma substances. The temperature is kept between 50-80°C during this last-mentioned mixing operation. After the mixing opera¬ tion the mixture is cooled and worked in such a way that phase reversal takes place. The end product which is obtained consists of a stable water-in-oil-emulsion. The product has a fat content

Claims
1. Method of producing a fat product containing milk fat with a reduced fat content starting from cream, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the cream is con¬ centrated to a cream product with a fat content of at least 75 % in a centrifugal separator, which cream product in connection with said concentration is mixed with vegetable oil in an amount of 0-50 % of the total amount of fat in the fat phase which is obtained consis¬ ting of a cream product and vegetable fat, which fat phase is mixed with a suitable amount of pasteurized water phase containing stabilizing means, preferably gelatin, salt and aroma substances, at which the tempe- rature during the last mentioned mixing operation is kept between 50-80°C, after which the obtained mixture is cooled and worked in such a way that phase reversal takes place, at which the obtained end product consists of a stable water-in-oil-emulsion, which product has a fat content of 25-60 % and only contains originally in the cream occurring emulsifiers and has a casein content below 2
