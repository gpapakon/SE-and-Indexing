 DESCRIPTIONOPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM AND ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM THATEMPLOYS ITBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThis invention concerns an optical recording medium that carries out new information recording using parts other than existing information recordable parts, and an entertainment system that employs it. Background of the InventionRecently there have been various types of optical recording media that employ laser light; among them, Figure 1 shows an example of a so-called CD-ROM. This CD-ROM 200 has a disk-shape substrate formed of polycarbonate, and it has a structure in which aluminum is deposited by vapor deposition in information recordable parts where pits are formed, and it is protected by a protective layer so that the aluminum vapor deposition parts are embedded. In Figure 1, data area 200D is formed mainly as the information recordable part.In manufacturing CD-ROM 200, a process is adopted in which information is recorded by laser light on a resist mask disk, this is developed to make pits, a metal mask is made from a disk master, and then a stamper is made from the mother. Figure 2A shows the state in which a transparent disk 201S, for example made of polycarbonate, is made with a stamper 203. Figure 2B shows the state in which a metal film 204 for reflection, made of aluminum, for example, is vapor deposited. Figure 2C shows the state in which a protective layer 205 is formed so as to embed metal film 204.When reading the information recordable part of a CD-ROM, laser light is 

irradiated from below disk 201S shown in Figure 2C, for reading the presence or absence of pits and reproducing the information.In a CD-ROM that has a structure and manufacturing process as described above, the playback information required by the user is written into the information recordable part such as data area 200D, and it is read out. But recently, besides this playback information, it has been demanded that additional information be written, such as security information to suppress the appearance of forgery software made by illicitly copying the data recorded on the CD-ROM, and personal information such as the end user's ID number or the number of his playback device.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of this invention to provide an optical recording medium in which a new information recording part is formed so that in an optical medium, not limited to a CD-ROM, additionally required information can be written, read, or, if necessary, erased.Yet another object of the present

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1. An optical recording medium on which information is written and read by laser light, comprising: a new information recording part formed on a part of the optical recording medium other than an information recordable part.
2. The optical recording medium as described in claim 1, wherein said new information recording part is provided on at least one of an area inside a lead-in area and an area outside a lead-out area of the optical recording medium.
3. The optical recording medium as described in claim 1, wherein said new information recording part contains a material which changes when subjected to laser light.
4. The optical recording medium as described in claim 1, wherein said new information recording part is made such that information recording is done by one of a reaction and a discoloration of a photosensitive material due to irradiation of laser light.
5. The optical recording medium as described in claim 1, wherein information of said new information recording part is erased by one of a uniform reaction and a discoloration of a photosensitive material due to irradiation of laser light.
6. The optical recording medium as described in claim 1, wherein at least one of security information and personal information is recorded on said new information recording part. 

7. An optical recording medium on which information is written and read by laser light, wherein the laser light that either records, plays back, and erases information of the new information recording part on the part other than the information recordable part is either laser light for reading on a user side or high-output laser light.
8. An entertainment system in combination with an optical recording medium on which information is written and read by laser light, wherein one plays games by reading a game program that is recorded on an information recordable part of the optical recording medium, said optical recording medium including a new information recording part formed on a part of the optical recording medium other than said information recordable part.
9. The entertainment system as described in claim 8, wherein in said new information recording part is recorded at least one of security information and personal information.
10. The entertainment system as described in claim 8, wherein the recording, playback, and erasing of information on said new information recording part is executed by one of laser light for reading and high-output laser light.
