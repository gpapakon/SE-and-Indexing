<ABSTRACT>
A bracket mounting system is proposed, consisting of a mounting neck (3), a bracket (1) and, possibly, a mounting plate (5). The three identical parts which have been mentioned make it possible to implement different installation positions in accordance with, for example, (a) to (i) in a flexible manner.

Mounting device for and with a tub shaped console (1)
and an bracket (3), whereby the bracket (3) comprises in

one plane a linear part (3
e
), which defines a neck end face
(9
b
) and an adjoining arc sector (3
b
) and whereby the
console (1) comprises an asymmetrically part in form of a

ridge of a roof (1
d
), on which one of the planes (7
a
) is
wider than the other, 
characterized in that
 the arc sector
(3
b
) is forming the second end plane (9
a
) and that
connecting elements are designated on one of the planes

(7
a
, 7
b
) of the part (1
d
) allowing to establish a connection
with one of the two neck end faces (9
a
, 9
b
) alternatively.
Mounting device according claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 one or the other of the neck end faces (9
a
, 9
b
) is
inclined oblique (γ) in relation to the axis (A) of the

bracket (3) at this end, preferably arranged at the linear
part (3
l
) and preferably inclined between 60° and 85°,
preferably inclined at an angle of 80° in relation to the

axis (A) and that the other neck end face (9
a
) is building
up an angle of at least approximately 90°, whereby further

preferably the other neck end face (9
a
) is standing at
least approximately perpendicular in relation to the axis

(A). 
Mounting device according to one of claims 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the ridge angle (δ) of the console
(1) is at least 90°, preferably 100°.
Mounting device according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 on the opening side of the tub (11) a
cubus shaped part (1
k
) is following the part in form of a
ridge of a roof (1
d
).
Mounting device according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the cross section of the bracket is
at the most rectangular or square.
Mounting device according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 a mounting collar (5) is provided,
and that both neck end faces (9
a
, 9
b
) are securable onto
the console (1) or the mounting collar (5) alternatively.
Mounting device according to claim 6, 
characterized in
that
 form taking connection parts are provided between both
end neck planes, console and mounting collar.
Mounting device according to one of claims 6 or 7,

characterized in that
 the mounting collar (5) has a shape
according standards for plug-in socket covers in household

installations. 
Mounting device according to one of claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that
 the linear part (3
e
) has a length of
at least 25% of the axial length of the bracket, preferably

50%.
Mounted console arrangement with a console and a
bracket according to one of claims 1 to 9.
Use of the mounting device according to one of claims
1 to 9 or the mounted console arrangement according claim

10 for illuminating objects, control- and/or display
fields, air -intake and/or -outlets, such as suction

devices in kitchens, water batteries, especially in
kitchens, thereby especially for the control- and display

fields of cooking and baking facilities.
