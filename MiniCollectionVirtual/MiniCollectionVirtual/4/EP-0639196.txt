<DESCRIPTION>
 New herbicidesThe present invention relates to novel herbicidally active thiadiazabicyclooctanes and thiadiazabicyclooctenes, to processes for the preparation thereof, to compositions comprising them as active ingredients, and to the use thereof for controlling weeds, especially selectively in crops of useful plants.Thiadiazabicyclo derivatives having herbicidal activity are generally known. Such compounds are disclosed, for example, in European Patent Applications EP-A-0238 711 and EP-A-0 304 920 as well as in US Patents USP 4,885,023, USP 4,684,397 and USP 4,801,408.Novel thiadiazabicyclooctanes and thiadiazabicyclooctenes having herbicidal activity have now been found.The thiadiazabicyclooctanes and thiadiazabicyclooctenes according to the invention correspond to formula Iwherein Z is oxygen or sulfur;Q is -C-C- or -C=C- ;R is CrC6alkyl, C3-C6cycloalkyl, CrC6haloalkyl, C3-C6alkenyl, C3-C6alkynyl,C3-C6haloalkenyl, C3-C6haloalkynyl, phenyl, benzyl, phenyl substituted by C]-C4- alkyl, C1-C4alkoxy, -C^aloalkyl or by halogen, benzyl substituted by C C4alkyl, C1-C4alkoxy, ^haloalkyl or by halogen, it being possible for the unsubstituted
