<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor apparatus.In particular, the present invention relates to a structure
of a control device for semiconductor power
devices having two gate voltages, selectable for
thyristor operation or transistor operation as
IGBT, specifically to a structure of a control
device in which, when a first insulated gate electrode goes
low and a second insulated gate electrode goes high, the
device goes to a turn-off condition to block
current from a collector electrode to an emitter
electrode or, when the first insulated gate electrode goes
high and the second insulated gate electrode goes low, the
device allows thyristor operation to conduct the
current or, when both the first and the second insulated gate
electrodes go high, it allows transistor
operation and goes to a turn-off status. EP-A-0 463 325 discloses a semiconductor device having a
bipolar transistor, an insulated gate field effect transistor
and a thyristor combined together into a MAGT (MOS assistance
gate thyristor). The different operation modes of the
semiconductor device are controlled by applying a signal to a
base electrode arranged between the two gate electrodes. Fig. 1 is a cross sectional illustration of
a double gate semiconductor device which is
controlled by a control device.
