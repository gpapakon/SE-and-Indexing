<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to solutions of polyimide-forming substances, comprising     A) polyamines and B) amides and/or esters of tetracarboxylic acids, where the amide or ester groups carry substituents from the group consisting of carboxyl, sulphonyl, silyl and siloxyl groups.   The solutions are used as polyimide coatings (paints, lacquers, enamels, varnishes).

<CLAIMS>
A solution of a polyimide-forming substance,
containing


A) polyamines and
B) amides or esters or mixtures of amides and
esters of tetracarboxylic acids, in which

from 10 to 100 mol% of the amido or ester
groups are substituted by carboxyl groups or

sulfonyl groups and/or from 0.5 to 30 mol% of
the amido or ester groups are substituted by

silyl or siloxyl groups, based on the total
amount of compounds used which have amino or

hydroxyl functional groups.
A solution as claimed in claim 1, containing, as
components A), aromatic or partly aromatic

diamines.
A solution as claimed in either of claims 1 and 2,
containing, as components B), diamides, diesters

or mixtures of diamides and diesters of
tetracarboxylic acids.
A solution as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,
containing components B) which are obtained by

reacting tetracarboxylic anhydrides with compounds
having amino or hydroxyl functional groups or 

mixtures of said compounds, which are selected
from the group consisting of the hydroxycarboxylic

acids, aminocarboxylic acids, hydroxysulfonic
acids, aminosulfonic acids, hydroxyl-substituted

silanes and siloxanes and the amino-substituted
silanes and siloxanes.
Use of a solution as claimed in any of claims 1 to
4 for the production of coatings.
