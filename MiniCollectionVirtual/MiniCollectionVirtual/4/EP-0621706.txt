<ABSTRACT>
A new system and method allows a Manager in a Simple 
Network Management Protocol (SNMP) environment to gather updates 

from its Agents. The system and method comprise the unique provision 
of an index which is used in each of the Agent's tables for indicating 

the various revisions thereof. The index lexicographically 
increases with each revision to the table. The Manager maintains a 

record of the index of the data which it has received from its Agents, 
requesting only that data having a lexicographically larger indexing. 

Further, the index is used in related tables so that the tables will be 
kept in "sync" in that the Manager will know whether it has the latest 

updates so that an accurate picture may be portrayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to network management using
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and, more particularly,
to a system and method for monitoring SNMP tables.Data communication has become a fundamental part of
computing. World-wide networks gather data about such diverse subjects
as atmospheric conditions, crop production, and airline traffic.
These networks evolved as independent entities without the ability, or,
until recently, the need, to interconnect with one another. New technologies,
generically named "internetworking", have emerged making
it possible to interconnect many disparate physical networks and make
them function as a coordinated unit. Using internetworking technologies,
a host, for example, on one network, may traverse multiple networks
and communicate with another host on a different network.The size of an "internet", or group of interconnected networks,
can vary quite significantly. For instance, the resulting network
may be enormously large, such as the nation-wide DARPA (Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency)/NSF (National Science Foundation)
Internet which connects most major research institutions, including
universities, corporate and government labs. Conversely, the
network may be relatively small, characterized in that it comprises only
a single corporation's individual local area networks (LANs).No matter the size of the network, it is clear that the task of
effectively managing the resulting interconnected network is quite important
and has been given a great deal of attention in the networking 
community. In managing a network, a network manager must keep
track of the devices on the networks, monitor the network's performance
and load, and diagnose and correct any problems.While products that manage homogeneous networks have
been available, managing heterogeneous networks is more complex
and, until recently, no generally accepted heterogeneous network
management standard existed. The Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP), which originated as a means for managing the
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/lnternet Protocol) and Ethernet
networks, has broadened rapidly since its monitoring and control
transactions are completely independent of TCP/IP and Ethernet.Using SNMP, network administrators can address queries
and commands to network nodes and devices. SNMP monitors network
performance and status; controls operational parameters; and
reports, analyzes and isolates faults. The protocol accomplishes these
functions by transporting management

<CLAIMS>
A method for use in a Manager of a network conforming to
the Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP comprising

at least one Agent, said Agent maintaining at least one
table comprising individual records defining one or more

individual managed objects, each individual record
having a unique index assigned thereto, said method

monitoring said table and being characterized in that it
comprises the steps of:


requesting from said Agent said individual records for
said managed objects;
receiving from said Agent said individual records for
said managed objects;
maintaining a record of said index of the most recently
received record for each managed object; and
periodically requesting from said Agent the next record
for each managed object as indicated by said index of

the most recently received record for each managed
object,
said next record having an index lexicographically
larger than the index of said most recently received

record for each managed object.
The method defined in Claim 1 characterized in that it
comprises , after said periodically requesting step, the

steps of receiving a next record for a managed object
and maintaining a record of said lexicographically

larger index.
The method defined in Claim 1 or 2 wherein said network
comprises a plurality of nodes and a corresponding

plurality of Agents, each of said Agents maintaining a 
node characteristics table and a transmission group

characteristics table.
A method for use in an Agent in a network having a
plurality of nodes, said network conforming to the

Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP, said method
maintaining a table comprising individual records

defining one or more individual managed objects and
being characterized in that it comprises the steps of:


maintaining an initial table of individual records
representing the initial status of said one or more

individual managed objects, each of said records having
an index; and
adding to said initial table a further individual record
representing a changed status of one of said individual

managed objects, said further additional record having
a lexicographically larger index than the initial said

one of said individual managed objects.
A Manager, in a network conforming to the Simple Network
Management Protocol SNMP comprising at least one

Agent, said Agent maintaining at least one table
comprising individual records defining one or more

individual managed objects, each individual record
having a unique index assigned thereto, said Manager

monitoring said table and being characterized in that it
comprises:


means for requesting from said Agent said individual
records for said managed objects;
means for receiving from said Agent said individual
records for said managed objects;
means for maintaining a record of said index of the most
recently received record for each managed object; and 
means for periodically requesting from said Agent the
next record for each managed object as indicated by said

index of the most recently received record for each
managed object, said next record having an index

lexicographically larger than the index of said most
recently received record for each managed object.
The Manager defined in Claim 5 characterized in that it
comprises means for receiving a next record for a

managed object and means for maintaining a record of the
index of said next record.
The Manager defined in Claim 5 or 6 wherein said network
comprises a plurality of nodes and a corresponding

plurality of Agents, each of said Agents maintaining a
node characteristics table and a transmission group

characteristics table, said Manager characterized in
that it comprises


means for receiving the records of said tables and means
for periodically polling said Agents for updates to said

tables.
An Agent in a network having a plurality of nodes, said
network conforming to the Simple Network Management

Protocol SNMP, said Agent maintaining a table

comprising individual records defining one or more
individual managed objects and being characterized in

that it comprises:

means for maintaining an initial table of individual
records representing the initial status of said one or

more individual managed objects, each of said records
having an index; and
means for adding to said initial table a further
individual record representing a changed status of one

of said individual managed objects, said further 
additional record having a lexicographically larger

index than the initial said one of said individual
managed objects.
The Agent defined in Claim 8 characterized in that it
comprises means for receiving requests from a Manager

for retrieving one or more of said individual records
and for forwarding said records to said Manager.
The Agent defined in Claim 8 or 9 characterized in that
it comprises means for maintaining a plurality of tables

including a node characteristics table and a
transmission group characteristics table.
