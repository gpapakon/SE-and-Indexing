<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for suppressing the bias errors induced 
by the Faraday effect in the output of a fibre optic gyroscope 

sensor coil 10 
exposed to a magnetic field H
A
 and H
T
 comprises 
arrangements 24, 28 formed at two leads of the sensor 

coil for compensating for bias shifts. One 24 of such 
arrangements comprises at least one loop of optical 

fiber for compensating for the effect induced by the 
magnetic field component H
T
 oriented transverse to the 
axis of the sensor coil while the other 28 comprises at 

least one loop oriented at a predetermined pitch angle 
for compensating for the effect induced by a magnetic 

field component H
A
 along the axis. In each case, a 
predetermined degree of twist of a preselected fiber 

twist mode is imposed upon the compensator loop for 
creating a counteracting, corrective, Faraday effect. 

Cross-coupling does not occur between the two 
compensators 24 and 28 as their twist rate perodicities 

are unequal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fiber optic gyroscopes and concerns
sensing coils therefor.Fiber optic rotation sensing devices, such as
gyroscopes, comprise two main components, (1) a front end
including a light source and detector and (2) a fiber
optic interferometer, including sensor coil, coupler and
polarizer that are mounted to a system. Light from the
source is split by the coupler into two beams, which are coupled into
respective leads of the sensing coil. The interferometer and associated
electronics process the phase relationship between the two interfering,
counter-propagating, beams of light when they emerge from the 
leads of the coil and are combined. A phase shift
difference between the two beams results from (1) coil
rotation and (2) so-called "environmental" factors.Environmental factors include such variables as
temperature, vibration (both acoustical and mechanical)
and magnetic fields (Faraday effects). These factors can
induce phase shifts between the counter-propagating beams
that are indistinguishable from those induced by rotation.
In the event that the sensing loop is of ideal single mode
fiber, the Faraday effect is cancelled when the light
travels through the fiber coil and a phase difference
between the counterpropagating beams is not generated.
The phase difference is observed, due to the
nonreciprocity of the Faraday effect, when retarders are
located asymmetrically within the fiber loop. Fiber
twist, occurring naturally during manufacture or induced
during the winding of the coil, acts as an actual and
inevitable retarder that leads to bias drift in the
presence of a magnetic field. One common method for
avoiding the influence of magnetic fields is to place the
sensor coil in a Âµ-metal housing. This solution is
effected at the cost of an increase in both the weight and
cost of the fiber optic gyro. The Faraday effect in fiber loops is discussed
in articles by Kazuo Hotate and Kunio Tabe ("Drift of an
Optical Fiber Gyroscope Caused by the Faraday Effect:
Influence of the Earth's Magnetic Field," Applied Optics,
Vol. 25 No. 7 (April 1, 1987) pp. 1086-1092 and "Drift of
an Optical Fiber Gyroscope Caused by the Faraday Effect:
Experiment," Journal of Lightwave Technology, Vol. LT-5,
No. 7 (July 1987) pp. 997-1001). Hotate and Tabe discuss
a relationship between the bias and drift of the fiber
optic gyro (FOG) due to transversely-directed magnetic
fields (i.e. fields substantially in the plane of the
loops that, in combination, constitute the sensor coil)
and the twisting of
