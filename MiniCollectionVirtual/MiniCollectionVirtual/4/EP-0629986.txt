Portable device intented for the learning of a language by a 
user on the basis of linguistic expressions recorded on a medium 

read by the device, comprising : 

a medium on which linguistic expressions are organised, 
a central unit (FS1), 
means for intermittently reading (10) said medium, 
a memory (120, 130, 220, 230), 
means for storing, during reading of the medium, linguistic 
expressions on a specific zone of said memory, 
recording means for storing, during execution of a record (REC) 
instruction of said program, in a specific zone of said memory, a 

signal supplied by a microphone (310) and corresponding to a 
linguistic expression spoken by the user, 
means for retrieving and feeding to means of monitoring (400), 
during execution of a monitoring instruction (FR, GB, MON) of said 

program, a linguistic expression stored in a specific zone of said 
memory, 
control means (FS2), 
 
said device being characterised in that : 


said linguistic expressions are organised on the medium in 
several sequences (S) consisting of a reference linguistic 

expression (Engl) in the langage to be learned and at least one 
other linguistic expression (ambl, Frl) of a different type, these 

linguistic expressions being preceded by identifying markers, of 
respective expressions and their type , 
a central unit (FS1) is programmable by the user to execute a 
defined program comprising an iteration , 
means for intermittently reading (10) said medium are controlled 
by said central unit at the commencement of the execution of the 

program in order to read a whole sequence (S) recorded on the 
medium, 
means for storing which store, during reading of the medium, at 
least two linguistic expressions of a given type in a specific zone  

 
of said memory designated by the central unit following 

identification of the marker preceding it , 
means for retrieving which retrieve to means of monitoring (400), 
during execution of a monitoring instruction (FR, GB, MON) of said 

program, a linguistic expression of a given type, stored in a 
specific zone of said memory selected by said central unit, 

according to type of expression which is to be listened allow the 
user to exit from the current iteration and to initiate a new 

execution of the program for the next sequence, 
the device includes means (FS4) whereby the user may program said 
central unit to enable said unit to define for each sequence the 

type of linguistic expressions to which he wishes to listen and the 
instructions contained in the iteration. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that said 
iteration comprises a record instruction (REC) and in that said 

control means (FS2) cause the exit from the iteration and the 
initiation of a new execution of the program in the absence of any 

signal from the microphone during execution of the record 
instruction. 
Device according to either of the claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the reading means (10) are controlled by the 

said central unit at the commencement of execution of the program 
to read also the first n linguistic expressions of given types from 

the following sequence and in that these first n linguistic 
expressions are stored by the said storage means in specific zones 

of the said memory designated by the said central unit, so as to 
permit, when the program is next run, monitoring of the first 

linguistic expression read simultaneously with its storage. 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the number 
n is equal to 1. 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that said means 
of storage and retrieval consist of two converters (FP1, FP2) each 

capable of analogue/digital and digital/analogue conversion, 
one (FP1) associated with two spe
cific zones (130, 120) of the  
 

memory assigned respectively to storing the reference linguistic 
expression (Engl) and to storing the linguistic expression spoken 

by the user, and the other (FP2) to two specific zones (220, 230) 
of the memory assigned respectively to storing a linguistic 

expression corresponding to the translation (Frl) in the user's 
language of the said reference linguistic expression and to the 

storage of the first linguistic expression of a given type (Fr2) of 
the following sequence. 
Device according to any the claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the linguistic expressions and said markers are recorded 

respectively on the two tracks (A, B) of a stereophonic recording. 
Device according to any of the claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that said media consists of a magnetic tape. 
Device according to any of the claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that it comprises a display system (600) and means of controlling 

this display system (510) in order to display the program defined 
by the user and in that the means of programming comprise a 

selection key (520) causing the different possible programming 
instructions to scroll on the display system and a validation 

key (530) for entering the selected displayed instruction into the 
program.
