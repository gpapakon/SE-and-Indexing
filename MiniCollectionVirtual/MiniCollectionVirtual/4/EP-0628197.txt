<ABSTRACT>
A digital servo track pattern for a magnetic medium which can be recorded and reproduced by a recording and reproducing system. The servo track pattern has a plurality of digital mark patterns recorded thereon, each of said digital mark patterns having a leading identifier field of digital bits, a trailing identifier field of digital bits and a field of digital synchronizing data located between said leading and trailing identifier fields. The leading identifier field of digital bits is electrically equivalent during reproducing while the medium is moving in a first direction to the trailing identifier field of digital bits while the medium is moving in a direction opposite to said first direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mass storage devices, and more particularly, to recording and
reproducing apparatus and methods for achieving very high density recording of digital
information at very high transfer rates.The state of the art with respect to which the independent claims are characterised is
represented by WO84-A-02221. The present invention is particularly directed to a magnetic recording and
reproducing system that is particularly suited for helical recorders of the type
which utilize cassettes of tape having two hubs and an outer shell, but is not
limited to helical recorders or to the use of such cassettes.However, because of the unique recording format used by the
system, the cassettes can be conveniently loaded on and unloaded from the
system at any of many positions along the length of tape in the cassette without
jeopardizing the integrity of the data recorded on the tape. Because of this
functionality, the system can conveniently use cassettes of different sizes and
different lengths of tape, and the necessity of rewinding the tape to the
beginning of the tape prior to unloading and loading is obviated.While the system disclosed herein is particularly suited for
providing archival recordings of data and may be a backup to a network
computer application having a large file server, the system disclosed herein is
also suited for use as a near-line library when used in combination with a large
computer disc drive with the disc drive interacting with the system to perform
frequent and multiple transfers of data between the system and the disc drive.
The present system is also particularly suited for a library functionality which
may be a repository for multiple disc drives and may use robotics for loading
and unloading hundreds if not thousands of cassettes during use. It is
particularly advantageous that the system utilizes cassettes having extremely
high capacity which may be on the order of 165 x 109 bytes for large cassettes
having maximum tape lengths. The system also exhibits extremely high data
transfer rates, i.e., on the order of 15 megabytes per second.While the system disclosed herein is advantageously suited for
use with cassettes of tape, it should be fully understood that the system does
not require such cassettes and can be used with reels of tape, albeit not with all
of the attendant advantages and desirable features. The format and
functionality that is disclosed has applicability to a wide range of recorders and 
is also not limited to a magnetic recording

<CLAIMS>
A system (20) for recording digital data on, and/or for
the playback of digital data from helical scan tracks on an

an elongate medium and including a servo (87-90) which
controls the longitudinal movement of the medium and reads a

longitudinal track (176) on the medium, the longitudinal
track comprising a plurality of digital patterns

positionally related to and identifying helical-scan tracks,
each pattern comprising a leading identifier field of

digital data, a trailing identifier field of digital data, a
field located between the leading and trailing identifier

fields, and synchronizing data, 
characterised in that
 each
pattern comprises binary signal transitions which are

positionally symmetrical about a respective central
transiton and each pattern appears to a servo reproducing

head to be identical whether the medium be moved in a
forward or a reverse direction; the field between the said

leading and trailing identifier fields contains the
synchronizing data and includes the central transition;

units of information are recorded as a set comprising a
predetermined number of successive pairs of helical-scan

tracks (144) on the medium, each set comprising an initial
track pair, a middle track pair and other track pairs; and

leading identifier fields have different bit patterns
according as they denote an initial helical-scan track pair,

a middle helical-scan track pair and other helical-scan
track pairs.
A system according to claim 1 wherein the medium is a
magnetic tape and each pattern comprises a succession of

magnetic flux transitions.
A system according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the
synchronizing data is constituted by an ANSI synchronizing

word. 
An elongate record medium having a region (144) in which
information is recorded on helical-scan tracks, and a servo

track (176) is recorded longitudinally on the elongate
medium and adapted to cooperate with a transducer of a servo

system (87-90) for controlling the longitudinal movement of
the medium, the servo track comprising a multiplicity of

digital track patterns, the patterns being positionally
related to and identifying respective helical-scan tracks,

each pattern comprising a leading digital field, a trailing
digital field, a field located between the leading and

trailing fields, and synchronizing data, 
characterised in
that
 each pattern comprises binary signal transitions which
are positionally symmetrical about a respective central

transiton and each pattern appears to a servo reproducing
head to be identical whether the medim be moved in a forward

or a reverse direction; the field between the said leading
and trailing identifier fields contains the synchronizing

data and includes the central transition; units of
information are recorded as a set comprising a predetermined

number of successive pairs of helical-scan tracks (144) on
the medium, each set comprising an initial track pair, a

middle track pair and other track pairs; leading identifier
fields have different bit patterns according as they denote

an initial helical-scan track pair, a middle helical-scan
track pair and other helical-scan track pairs.
A medium according to claim 4 wherein the medium is a
magnetic tape and each pattern comprises a succession of

magnetic flux transitions.
A medium according to claim 4 or 5 wherein the
synchronizing data is constituted by an ANSI synchronizing

word.
