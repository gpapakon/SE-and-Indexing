<ABSTRACT>
The base (1) includes an outer body (2) of biocompatible metallic material with a cavity (3) in which an inner body (4) of biocompatible metallic material with a seat (8) for holding a prosthesis is disposed with the interposition of a layer (5) of shock-absorbent material. An annular retaining element (10) connected to the edge of the cavity (3) in the outer body (2) has a resiliently-deformable inner edge (10b) which engages a corresponding outer collar (4a) on the inner body (4) so as to be resiliently preloaded thereby.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a base for dental 
prosthesis and the like for implantation in bone. More specifically, the subject of the invention is a base 
for implantation in bone, including an outer body of rigid 
material, preferably a biocompatible metallic material, 
having means for anchoring it to the bony tissue and a 
cavity in which an inner body, also made of a rigid 
material, preferably a biocompatible metallic material, 
with a seat for holding a prosthesis is disposed with the 
interposition of a layer of resiliently shock-absorbent 
bonding material; an annular retaining element being 
connected to the edge of the cavity in the outer body and 
having an inner edge. A base for implantation in bone of the type specified above 
is disclosed in WO-A-8 706 816 (fig. 4). In that prior implantation base the inner edge of the 
annular retaining ring merely overlies the upper portion of 
the resilient bonding material interposed between the outer 
body and the inner body. With this construction the 
resilient bonding material is not sealingly prevented from 
coming into contact with food and/or mouth fluids which can 
seep through the interspace between the retaining ring and 
the inner body and cause a degradation of said resilient 
bonding material. Other bases for implantation in bone are described, for 
example, in U.S. patent 4 780 080, French patent 
application 2 580 169, and Dutch patent application 
8200711.  
 The bases for implantation in bone described in these 
documents have the disadvantage that the resiliently shock-absorbent 
bonding material interposed between the inner and 
outer bodies extends to the top of the base and, in the 
condition of use, is in contact with the surrounding 
tissue, particularly the gum tissue. This material can thus 
come into contact with food and various liquids introduced 
into the mouth and may sooner or later become degraded. The object of the present invention is to provide a base 
for implantation in bone which overcomes the problem of the 
bases of the prior art described above. According to the invention, this object is achieved by  
 
means of a base for implantation in bone of the type 
specified above, characterised in that the inner edge of 
the annular retaining element is in engagement with a 
corresponding outer collar on the inner body so as to be 
resiliently preloaded thereagainst. In the base for implantation in bone according to the 
invention, the retaining ring connected to the outer body 
prevents the inner body from coming
