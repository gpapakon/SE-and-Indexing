<ABSTRACT>
The mixture comprises a mixture of polyolefin with a mixture of 10 to 30 % by weight of vinyl acetate and/or acrylic ester radicals. This mixture makes it possible to improve appreciably the performance of films thus obtained when compared with the films containing only vinyl acetate radicals from the viewpoint of their processibility, their airtightness and their memory.

<CLAIMS>
Thermoplastic material, weldable by high frequency, the 
weldability of which is adjustable in relation to the 

materials of a similar composition to be assembled, and/or the 
constraints concerning working conditions and the environment, 

and in particular intended to replace polyvinyl chloride in 
its applications using flexible films, characterized in that 

it is composed of a mixture of polyolefin resin and a mixture 
of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers containing vinyl 

acetate radicals and ethylene acrylic ester containing acrylic 
ester radicals, the weights of the radicals alone representing 

10 to 30% by weight of the overall mixture. 
Thermoplastic material, according to the preceding claim, 
characterized in that the mixture of copolymers containing 

vinyl acetate and acrylic ester radicals contain at least 40% 
by weight of acrylic ester. 
Thermoplastic material, according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the mixture of 

copolymers containing the vinyl acetate and acrylic ester 
radicals contains 30% ± 10% of vinyl acetate radicals and 70% 

± 10% of acrylic ester radicals. 
Thermoplastic material, according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the cumulative weight 

of vinyl acetate and acrylic ester radicals represents 
18% ± 3% of the total weight of copolymers and polyolefin 

resins. 
Application of the thermoplastic material, according to any 
one of the preceding claims to the production of films 

intended for the manufacture of objects in particular by high 
frequency welding.
