<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a high frequency module comprises 
the steps of connecting leads to a circuit board, covering the 

circuit board with an insulating member such that the leads (13a-13d) 
protrude from the insulating member, cutting off portions of 

the leads protruding from the insulating member having been 
molded, forming a metal film (16) on the entire periphery of the 

insulating member, and removing the metal film around the 
leads to thereby form electrodes (17a-17h) which are separated from the 

other portions of the metal film. The metal film is formed by 
evaporation, spraying or plating while the portions of the metal 

film around the leads are removed by chemical etching or 
machining. Further, the leads are connected to the circuit board 

on the same surface as electronic parts. The circuit board is 
covered with the insulating member in a rectangular 

parallelepiped configuration. The electrodes individually 
extend from the sides where the leads are present to the 

surface contiguous with the sides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high frequency module
for use in, for example, a radio communication apparatus as a
high frequency signal processing device and, more particularly,
to a high frequency module having a circuit board carrying
electronic parts thereon, an insulating member covering the
circuit board, a metal film or shield formed on the insulating
member, and electrodes, and a method of producing the same.A problem with a conventional radio communication
apparatus is that spurious radiations (wave leakage) from a
high frequency processing circuit, e.g., oscillation circuit turn
round to cause the other circuits to oscillate also. Another
problem is that noise causes the apparatus to malfunction. To
eliminate these problems, it has been customary to provide the
oscillation circuit with a shield. The shield is implemented by,
for example, metal plates which are bonded together in a
partitioning structure, This kind of shield is used to shield a
high frequency amplifier circuit, oscillation circuit, control
circuit or similar device. Specifically, a metal plate is
soldered at one end to a ground pattern provided on a circuit 
board which carries electronic parts thereon, thereby
surrounding the device. Another metal plate covers the top of
the device. The metal plates, e.g., silver-plated copper plates
have their adjoining ends connected together by screws or
rivets or by solder. However, this kind of approach has a
drawback that the shield structure is complicated and
troublesome to produce, resulting in an increase in cost.In light of the above, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication No. 59-186397 teaches a composite IC (Integrated
Circuit) made up of a plurality of molded modules. The molded
modules are mounted on a circuit board and electrically
connected together by a circuit pattern to constitute desired
circuitry. However, this approach brings about another problem
that spurious radiations occur from the circuit pattern, which
interconnects the modules, and affect the other circuits or even
an external apparatus.Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 8, No. 142 (E-254) [1579]
and JP-A-59-51555 show a method to fabricate a high frequency
module comprising the steps of connecting leads to
a circuit board on which electronic parts are mounted, covering
said circuit board by an insulating member, forming
a metal film on the entire periphery of said insulating
member, and removing said metal film around said leads to
thereby form electrodes.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
