<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a
plurality of ink jet head base bodies.Document
US-A-5 049 231
describes a method for forming a liquid jet recording
head including the steps of forming multiple resistive
heaters and corresponding electrode pairs on a substrate,
one of the electrodes in each pair being connected
to a common test electrode formed on the substrate. After
the head is tested to determine if there are any defects in
a protective layer on the heaters and electrode pairs, the
portion of the substrate carrying the test electrode is removed. Typically, among ink jet heads, the construction
of an ink jet head of the type where a number of
electricity-heat converters are provided on a substrate
is provided on the substrate 1 with a heat generating
resistance layer 2 containing heat generating resistors
2a as heat energy generators for generating heat energy
to be acted on the liquid and an electrode layer 3 for
applying voltage to said heat generating resistors, as
shown in Figs. 3A and 3B. Also, a protective layer 4
is provided, as required, on the electricity-heat
converters comprised of the heat generating resistance
layer 2 and the electrode layer 3.An ink jet head is constructed in such a way as to
bond a ceiling plate having grooves onto such
substrate, each groove serving to form an orifice 
(discharge opening) 7 through which liquid is
discharged and a liquid channel 6 communicating to said
orifice 7 and provided at a site corresponding to said
heat generating resistor 2a. Conventionally, such ink
jet head was obtained by preparing electricity-heat
converters corresponding to a plurality of ink jet
heads on an Si wafer which is a substrate, and cutting
and separating the Si wafer after bonding such a
ceiling plate to the Si wafer.Herein, a base body 8 can be obtained by
laminating at least an electrode layer 3 and a heat
generating resistance layer 2 on a substrate 1,
patterning them into a predetermined shape, and forming
heat generating resistors 2a electrically connected to
a pair of electrodes 3a, 3b spaced apart a
predetermined interval, as shown in Figs. 4A and 4B.And the electrode layer 3 and the heat generating
resistance layer 2 are formed by thin film forming
technology such as sputtering which may be utilized in
the semiconductor fields.On the other hand, such base body has been made in
larger size in recent years, aiming at reducing the
costs due to improvement of the through-put. Along
with the larger base body, the substrate is changed in
shape from
