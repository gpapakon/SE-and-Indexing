<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for varying an electrically variable current limiting reactor (VICLR) (16) are provided in cooperation with an electrostatic precipitator automatic voltage control system. The inductance of VICLR (16) is varied by altering the DC current in control winding (66) of VICLR (16). A power source (10) connects serially to an inverse parallel SCR1 and SCR2, to VICLR (16), and to a TR set comprising a transformer (18) and rectifier (20) which supply power to precipitator (22). System electrical characteristics on both sides of the TR set are monitored. Computer (40) uses these monitored values to continuously calculate form factor and fractional conduction values. Step-down transformer (60) is connected to solid state relay (62) which is in turn connected to full wave bridge rectifier (64). Rectifier (64) is connected to control winding (66) of VICLR (16). Solid state relay (62) is also connected to computer (40). Solid state relay (62) can be triggered on each half cycle thereby providing DC current pulses to VICLR (16). The number of pulses supplied to said control winding within a predetermined time span can be altered thereby changing the net current in control winding (67) of VICLR (16), and hence, altering the inductance. The number of half cycles applied may be manually altered by an operator or responsive to system operating conditions, including but not limited to, form factor and fractional conduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the control of electrostatic precipitators and, 
more specifically, concerns the electrical adjustment of an electrically variable current 
limiting reactor (VICLR) utilized in an electrostatic precipitator control system. Controlling air pollution is an important environmental goal and is the subject 
of increasingly strenuous regulation. Electrostatic precipitation, which involves the 
removal of undesirable particulate matter from a gas stream, is one highly effective 
air pollution control technique. An electrostatic precipitator is an air pollution control 
device designed to electrically charge and collect particulates generated from industrial 
processes. These particulates flow through the precipitator where they are 
charged. Oppositely charged plates then attract and collect these negatively charged 
particles. The cleaned gas may then be further treated or discharged to the atmosphere. Maintaining precipitator collection at its greatest efficiency is an important, yet 
often difficult task. Conditions under which electrostatic precipitators operate can 
fluxuate dramatically having a detrimental effect on the operating efficiency of the 
precipitator. Less than maximum precipitator efficiency results in increased pollution 
to the atmosphere -- perhaps to the point of exceeding regulatory limitations. Accordingly, 
controlling and maintaining precipitator collection efficiency is an important 
objective. The background for the present invention is significantly described in U.S. Pat. 
No. 5,068,811 (the '811 patent), issued Nov. 26, 1991 and entitled "Electrical Control 
System for an Electrostatic Precipitator" which is incorporated by reference herein. 
The '811 patent teaches that the waveforms that make up the voltages and currents in 
the precipitator control system are highly important to precipitator collection efficiency. More particularly, the '811 patent teaches that two measurements which are 
highly effective for evaluating waveform shapes, and their effect on the precipitator 
collection and electrical efficiency, are primary form factor and secondary fractional 
conduction. Maintaining form factor and fractional conduction at desired levels 
produces maximum system operating efficiency. This is accomplished through proper 
sizing of electrical components embodied in the control system. Particularly significant  
 
is the appropriate sizing of a current limiting reactor (CLR) utilized by the 
system. Generally described, electrical circuitry
