<ABSTRACT>
A strip (12) is provided for running up the "A" pillar 
(18) of a vehicle body and along its roof line over the 

door openings. The strip is made of extruded plastics or 
rubber material and supports a sealing part (28) adjacent 

the door opening for providing a seal against the closing 
door. The strip is mounted in position by means of an 

incorporated metal channel (16) locking against a series 
of studs (24) positioned along the body. The strip has a 

relatively stiff outer lip (30) carrying a more flexible 
inner lip (32) which flexes into sealing contact with the 

local body panel (18). The inner lip (32) is provided 
with a groove (34) running along its length. The position 

of this groove (34) is predetermined in accordance with, 
and varies in accordance with, the varying profile of the 

body panel (18) so as to ensure that the inner lip (32) 
bends to a greater or lesser extent along the length of 

the strip, according to the local contour of the body 
panel. This ensures that the inner lip (32) provides 

effective sealing along the length of the strip and 
ensures that the attitude of the outer lip (30) remains 

substantially unchanging to provide a constant styling 
line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sealing, trimming or finishing strip 
for attachment to and along a panel-like member of varying 
contour, the strip having a main portion carrying a relatively 
flexible lip for bearing against at least part of the length of 
the panel-like member. Such a strip is known from EP-A 280 037. In this known form of 
strip, however, the lip is required to have a varying dimension 
in a direction perpendicular to the length of the strip in order 
to be able to maintain itself in contact with the varying contour 
of the panel-like member. This varying dimension is obtained 
during manufacture by cutting off varying portions of the lip. 
This is a relatively complex process and is also wasteful because 
part of the material produced by the manufacturing process (e.g. 
extruding) is then immediately discarded. In accordance with the invention, therefore, the known strip is 
characterised in that the lip is formed with a narrow region of 
reduced lip thickness running along the length of the lip, the 
position of the narrow region relative to the lip edge varying  
 
along the length of the lip so as to provide a predetermined lip 
bending line, the position of the predetermined lip bending line 
and the corresponding bending of the lip varying in a manner 
corresponding to the varying contour of the panel-like member 
against which the lip bears.  
 Sealing, trimming and finishing strips embodying the 
invention will now be described, by way of example only, 
with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings 
in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a car illustrating where 
one of the strips is fitted; Figure 2 is a diagrammatic section on the line II-II of 
Figure 1; Figure 3 is a diagrammatic cross-section on the line 
III-III of Figure 1; Figure 4 is a diagrammatic cross-section on the line IV-IV 
of Figure 1; Figure 5 is a perspective view of the strip showing the 
form which it has along most of its length; Figure 6 is a perspective view corresponding to Figure 5 
but showing the form which the strip has at a local region 
along its length; and Figure 7 is a diagrammatic cross-section corresponding to 
Figure 2 but illustrating a strip not embodying the  
 
invention. As shown in Figure 1, a motor vehicle body 10 has a 
sealing, trimming or finishing strip diagrammatically 
illustrated at 12 which runs along the roof line and down 
the "A" pillar of the vehicle - that is, the body pillar 
at the front edge of the front door of the vehicle. The 
purpose of the strip is

<CLAIMS>
A sealing, trimming or finishing strip (12) for attachment 
to and along a panel-like member (18,36) of varying contour, the 

strip (12) having a main portion (26) carrying a relatively 
flexible lip (32) for bearing against at least part of the length 

of the panel-like member (18,36), characterised in that the lip 
(32) is formed with a narrow region (34) of reduced lip thickness 

running along the length of the lip, the position of the narrow 
region (34) relative to the lip edge varying along the length of 

the lip (32) so as to provide a predetermined lip bending line, 
the position of the predetermined lip bending line and the 

corresponding bending of the lip varying in a manner 
corresponding to the varying contour of the panel-like member 

(18,36) against which the lip bears. 
A strip according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
narrow region comprises a groove (34). 
A strip according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
along part (40), only, of the length of the strip, the lip (32) 

is shaped so as to be completely clear of the panel-like member 
(18,36).  

 
A strip according to any preceding claim, characterised in 
that it incorporates metal reinforcement (16). 
A strip according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
by mounting means (24,16) for mounting the main portion (26) of 

the strip (12) relative to the panel-like member (18,36), and in 
that the position of the narrow region (34) along the length of 

the strip is such that the attitude of the main portion (26) 
relative to the mounting means (24,16) is substantially constant 

along the length of the strip. 
A strip according to claim 5, characterised in that it 
incorporates metal reinforcement (16), and in that the mounting 

means comprises means (24) on the panel-like member (18,36) for 
co-operating with the metal reinforcement (16). 
A strip according to any preceding claim, characterised in 
that the panel-like member (18,36) is part of a motor vehicle 

body. 
A strip according to claim 7, characterised in that the said 
panel-like member (18,36) extends along the roof line (36) of the 

vehicle body and along the top of a door opening therein, and in  
 

that the main portion (26) of the strip supports a sealing part 
(28) for providing a seal for at least part of the periphery of 

a door for the opening. 
A strip according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the 
panel-like member (18) extends down the "A" pillar of the vehicle 

body. 
A strip according to any preceding claim, characterised in 
that the said main portion (26) of the strip adjacent to the lip
