<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a switching strip for triggering switching pulses, it being possible for the strip to be fitted on the front edge of a movable closure member or on a fixed counterpart of an opening which is to be closed or on another carrier body, and the strip being formed by an elastic profile which exhibits a through-passage duct with the beam or the beams of a light barrier, of which the through-passage cross-section can be reduced when the switching strip runs onto an obstruction. With the action of pressure which occurs when said switching strip runs onto an obstacle, that region 6; 16 of the boundary wall of the through-passage duct 4; 14 which is remote from the action of pressure is supported against simultaneous movement on the bearing part.
