<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling a continuous multi-component 
slurrying process at an oil or gas well comprises 

continuously flowing substances for creating a slurry in 
response to a slurry flow rate factor and continuously 

flowing another substance for the slurry in response to a 
flow rate of at least a predetermined one of the other 

substances or the slurry itself. The method can include 
density control, slurry (tub) level control, and a 

combination of such controls. The method can operate in 

either closed loop or open loop manner, and control can be 
effected with either of two types of control signals 

depending on whether the controlled device is an integrating 
or non-integrating type. The method can also provide for 

bumpless transition between manual and automatic control.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a control
method for a multi-component slurrying process at an oil or
gas well.By "slurry" herein, we intend to encompass
cementitious mixtures that are made at an oil or gas well in
a fluid state so that they can be pumped into the well but
which ultimately harden in the well to provide sealing and
compressive strength properties useful for known purposes in
the well. For example, a settable mud is one type of
cementitious slurry, and a cement is another type of
cementitious slurry.When a cementitious slurry is needed, a qualified
person analyzes the particular situation and designs a
particular slurry. Such a design includes a list of
ingredients (the "recipe") and possibly one or more desired
parameters (e.g. density). Such a design has at least one
of what is refereed to herein as a "defining
characteristic". For a settable mud, a defining
characteristic is the recipe of ingredients. For a cement,
a defining characteristic is density.The design is implemented at the well by mixing
the ingredients in a manner to obtain the one or more
defining characteristics. The ingredients that are mixed
can be of two types: essential materials and additives. As
used in this description and the accompanying claims
defining the present invention, "essential materials" are 
ingredients that are required to obtain a particular
defining characteristic of a slurry; "additives" are
ingredients that modify or enhance the 
defining or other characteristics of the slurry. Any
particular slurry will always have essential materials, but it
may or may not have additives.For the slurries and fluids to which the overall process
disclosed herein is directed, there are always at least three
essential materials for obtaining a defining characteristic.
For example, a defining characteristic of a cement slurry is
density; three essential materials for obtaining this
characteristic are a hydrating fluid (e.g., fresh water,
seawater, brine), a cementitious substance (e.g., cement), and
a density control agent (e.g., fly ash). As a further
example, a defining characteristic of a drilling fluid is also
density; three essential materials for obtaining a desired
density in a drilling fluid are a fluid medium (e.g., fresh
water, seawater, brine, hydrocarbon fluid), a viscosity
control agent (e.g., bentonite), and a density control agent
(e.g., barite). As another example, a defining characteristic
of a settable mud is the recipe itself; three essential
materials for a settable mud recipe are a dilution

A method of making a multi-component slurry, in a continuous process,
for an oil or gas well, which method comprises: supplying a fluid to a mixer,

supplying a dry material to the mixer and supplying an additive to the mixer;
characterised in that a mass flow rate setpoint for the fluid is computed in response to

a predetermined absolute mass percentage for the fluid a predetermined desired
density for the slurry, and a predetermined desired flow rate of the slurry into the oil

or gas well; and fluid is flowed in response to the computed mass flow rate setpoint
for the fluid; a mass flow rate setpoint for the dry material is computed in response to

a predetermined absolute mass percentage for the dry material, the predetermined
desired density for the slurry, and the predetermined desired flow rate of the slurry

into the oil or gas well; and the dry material is flowed in response to the computed
mass flow rate setpoint for the dry material; and a mass flow rate setpoint for the

additive is computed in response to a predetermined mass concentration for the
additive and the mass flow rate for a predetermined one of the fluid and the dry

material; and the additive is flowed in response to the computed mass flow rate
setpoint.

density of a mixture of the fluid, dry material and 

the additive obtained by claim 1;

measured density with the desired density.

additive metering device prior to disabling the manual control.
