<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for starting a waste-heat boiler (10), in particular in a gas turbine combined cycle power plant, having at least two separate pressure systems (12, 14) at different pressure levels. The steam generated is not used until after a prescribed pressure and temperature parameters have been reached for operating a steam turbine. Until the prescribed pressure and temperature parameters have been reached, the steam generated in the pressure system (12) at higher pressure is fed to the at least one pressure system (14) at lower pressure for the purpose of heating it. The invention also relates to an arrangement for carrying out this method.

Method for starting a waste-heat boiler (10) in
a gas turbine combined-cycle power station, having two

pressure systems (12, 14) at different pressure levels,
each having a superheater branch, the steam generated

only being used for operating a steam turbine after
reaching specified pressure and temperature parameters,

having the following procedure steps:

during the heating-up phase in the starting
operation the higher and lower pressure systems (12,

14) are connected to one another via a by-pass
station (40) in such a manner that the steam from

the superheater (26) of the higher pressure system
(12) initially flows into the superheater branch of

the lower pressure system (14) and, as the lower
pressure system (14) progressively heats up, flows

to a low-pressure turbine;
when a specified pressure level in the lower
pressure system (14) is reached, the by-pass station

(40) is closed.
Method according to Claiml, characterized in that
the heat of the steam from the higher pressure system

(12) is supplied via heat exchangers to the lower
pressure system (14).
Method according to Claiml, characterized in that
the heat of the steam from the higher pressure system

(12) is supplied to the lower pressure system (14) by
introducing it into the system (14).
Arrangement for carrying out the method according
to one of the preceding claims, having a waste-heat

boiler (10) and having at least two pressure systems
(12, 14) of differing pressure to which in each case at

least one evaporator (24, 34), located in the waste-heat
boiler (10), and a superheater (26, 36) are assigned,

each of the two pressure systems having a separate feedwater
conduit (20, 30) and a separate outlet conduit (28,

38) from the waste-heat boiler (10) to a steam turbine,
and having a by-pass station (40) for connecting the two

outlet conduits (28, 38), by means of which by-pass 
station the two pressure systems (12, 14) can be

connected in such a manner that, during the heating-up
phase in the starting operation of the waste-heat boiler

(10), the steam from the superheater (26) of the higher
pressure system (12) initially flows into the superheater

branch of the lower pressure system (14) and, as the
lower pressure sytem (14) progressively heats up, flows

to a low-pressure turbine.
Arrangement according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the by-pass station (40) is configured as a

safety device which serves as a substitute for a safety
valve for the higher pressure system (12).
Arrangement according to Claim 4 or 5,
characterized in that each of the systems (12, 14) has an

economizer (22, 32) whose outlet feeds into the
associated evaporator circuit (24, 34).
