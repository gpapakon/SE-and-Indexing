<ABSTRACT>
A benzothiazole compound represented by general formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof 
wherein, R¹ represents halogen; R² and R³ represent each independently hydrogen or halogen; R⁴ represents hydrogen, 

halogen, lower alkyl, alkoxy or alkylmercapto; and R⁵ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl. The compound (I) and 
salt thereof have an aldose reductase inhibitor activity against mammals including human and is excellent in safety.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel benzothiazole
compound having superior aldose reductase inhibitory activity
and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (hereinafter
generally referred to as "compound of the invention"); an
intermediate for producing the compound of the invention;
production thereof; and pharmaceutical compositions containing
the compound of the invention.The aforementioned compound of the invention is useful as
an aldose reductase inhibitor, as well as for the prevention
and/or treatment of the complications of diabetes, such as
faulty union of corneal injury, diabetic cataract, retinopathy,
nephropathy and neurosis.Traditionally, blood sugar regulators such as insulin and
synthetic hypoglycemic agents have been widely used for
treating diabetes. Diabetes is a disease which accompanies
various complications which are hardly prevented from
developing by a mere control of the blood sugar, and a new
therapeutic agent for the complications of diabetes has been
demanded. Accumulation of and increase in sorbitol and
galactitol in tissues which are caused by chronic hyperglycemia
have recently been drawing attention as the mechanism of the
onset of the complications of diabetes. Some literatures suggest that a compound having an
inhibitory action on the activity of aldose reductase, which is
an enzyme capable of converting aldose such as glucose or
galactose into sorbitol or galactitol, is useful for the
treatment of the complications of diabetes, such as faulty
union of corneal injury, cataract, retinopathy, nephropathy and
neurosis [see J.H. Kinoshita et al. Biochem. Biophys. Acta,
158, 472 (1968), Richard Poulson et al, Biochem. Pharmacol.,
32, 1495 (1983) and D. Dvornik et al, Science, 182, 1145
(1973)].Based on the foregoing, the study is directed to the
prevention and treatment of the complications of diabetes by the
inhibition of aldose reductase activity to ultimately inhibit
accumulation of polyols such as sorbitol and galactitol.Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 40478/1982 and
107970/1988 describe that various compounds synthesized for this
end have aldose reductase inhibitory action. Yet, the
development of a therapeutic agent for the complications of
diabetes, which has a still more excellent aldose reductase
inhibitory action, is desired.In view of the above, the present inventors have conducted
intensive studies with the aim of developing a therapeutic agent
for the complications of diabetes, which has an aldose
reductase inhibitory action, and found that
