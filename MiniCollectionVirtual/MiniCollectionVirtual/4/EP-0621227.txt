<ABSTRACT>
A relatively small range of relative movement between 
the inner boom 10 and the outer boom 12 of an articulated 

log loader and the problems associated therewith may be 
avoided through the use of links (32) having spaced pivot 

pins (34,35) respectively connected to adjacent ends of an 
inner boom (10) and an outer boom (12) along with meshed 

sector gears (39,40) which act to synchronize relative 
movement between the inner boom (10') and the outer boom 

(12') upon operation of a hydraulic cylinder (20') inter-connecting 
the two.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to articulating booms and more 
particularly to an articulating boom for loading logs. Articulating booms usually consist of an inner and an 
outer boom. These booms are connected by a hydraulic 
cylinder which causes the outer boom to rotate with respect 
to the inner boom. The inner boom is conventionally 
connected by a hydraulic cylinder to a base and is allowed 
to pivot with respect to the base by action of the hydraulic 
cylinder. A grapple is typically located on the 
remote end of the outer boom. This allows the articulating 
boom to pick up and move heavy objects, such as logs, 
from one position to another. In a typical application, 
the articulating boom is used to load logs onto a truck 
for transportation and later to take the logs off the 
truck for delivery at a mill. A typical prior art construction has a couple of 
problems. The rotation between the upper boom and lower 
boom is limited to approximately 161° for a variety of 
reasons. To obtain this amount of rotation, the pivot 
point of the two booms must be placed substantially below  
 
the centerline of the boom structure. This creates a more 
complex design. Another problem of note is that the 
moment arm which can be applied to the outer boom is 
considerably less when the outer boom is fully retracted 
than when it is fully extended. This effectively limits 
the lifting capacity of the loader in certain configurations. The limited relative motion between the inner and 
outer booms results in an inability to properly position 
logs close to the mast of the loader. Boom operators have 
developed a variety of techniques for getting around this 
limitation. One is the practice of swinging the grapple 
while loaded with wood toward the mast and the operator 
while simultaneously opening the grapple to release the 
wood. Rather than simply dropping the load in the desired 
location, this method literally "flings" the load in the 
desired direction, which can result in the load undesirably 
scattering when it impacts the truck bed, mast 
or the like. Another problem occurs when trying to lift logs close 
to the mast of the loader. The relatively small moment 
arm effectively limits the lifting capability which makes 
it difficult to unload logs near the mast. Several designs have been developed to overcome these 
shortcomings. These designs are capable of relative 
motion to 175° and even greater while retaining acceptable 
moment arms. However, these designs have not been well 
received because they require

An articulating boom comprising: 
   an inner boom; 

   an outer boom near an end of said inner boom; 
   a short link extending between the adjacent ends 

of said inner and outer boom; 
   a first pivot connecting said link to the end of 

said inner boom; 
   a second pivot spaced from said first pivot and 

connecting said link to the end of said outer boom; 
   a motor interconnecting said booms and operable 

to effect relative movement between the booms; and 
   a synchronizing mechanism interconnecting said 

ends so that when said motor effects said relative 
movement, said outer boom will swing about said adjacent 

end of said inner boom about said first and said second 
pivots and said link will swing about said inner boom 

about said first pivot. 
An articulating boom comprising: 
   an upright mast; 

   an inner boom pivoted at one end to said mast; 
   an outer boom near the end of said inner boom 

remote from said mast; 
   a short link extending between said remote end 

and an adjacent end of said outer boom; 
   a first pivot connecting said link to said 

remote end; 
   a second pivot spaced from said first pivot and 

connecting said link to said adjacent end; 
   a motor interconnecting said booms and operable 

to effect relative movement between the booms; and 
   a synchronizing mechanism interconnecting said 

remote end and said adjacent end so that when said motor 
effects said relative movement, said outer boom will swing 

about said remote end about first and said second pivot 
 

and said link will swing about said inner boom about said 
first pivot. 
The articulating boom of Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the synchronizing mechanism is a set of mating 

gears. 
The articulating boom of Claim 3, wherein said 
gears have equal pitches so that there is equal angular 

movement about the pivots.

pivot.

The articulating boom of any preceding claim, 
wherein the outer boom has a grapple connected to a remote 

end of said outer boom.

wherein the motor is a hydraulic cylinder. 
The articulating boom of Claim 2, wherein the 
upright mast has a post and a base, the base being 

rotatable about the post in a horizontal plan so that the
