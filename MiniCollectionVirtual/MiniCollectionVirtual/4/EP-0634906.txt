<ABSTRACT>
The device according to the present invention consists of an ocular (1) connected to an optic fibre (2) sheathed with a means (4) for the moving of the visualizing end (3), that may be applied by means of a connecting element (8), between the handle (M) and the blade (LA) of the laryngoscope, so that said optic fibre (2) sliding along the blade through two guides (11) or similar, arrives to the larynx, undirectly visualizing said larynx and its aditus, even when this seems to be impossible with a direct vision, thus solving the problem of difficult and, at present, impossible intubations.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "A VISUALIZATION DEVICE WITH OPTIC FIBRES THAT MAY BE APPLIED TO A LARYNGOSCOPE"The present device concerns a visualization device with optic fibres that may be applied on laryngoscopes of any kind for a solution of difficult intubations, particularly in emergency situations.It is already well known that the laryngoscope is an instrument that visualizes the larynx and allows to perform an intubation, that consists in introducing a tube into the trachea, for performing an assisted breathing under direct vision. The known instrument consists of a handle that contains the batteries, and of a spatula or a blade provided with a small lamp for lighting the oral cavity.The intubation technique consists of the introduction of the laryngoscope's blade into the oral cavity, in removing with the same the tongue until the end of said blade touches the glosso-epiglottic fold, so that the operator may visualize the larynx and its aditus, moving the epiglottis, and then may introduce the tube inside the trachea through the vocal chords. 

Sometimes, and due to anatomic anomalies, it may be difficult to visualize the larynx and its aditus, and therefore the intubation becomes rather difficult and sometimes even impossible.Above mentioned problems should be solved by means of a laryngoscope provided with an incorporated optic fibre, that may be introduced from the nose and slide down into the larynx for providing a direct visualization.The laryngoscope with the incorporated optic fibre does not solve difficult intubations and may not be used in emergency situations because of the application through the nose.It is the aim of the present invention to provide a device that may be applied to the known laryngoscopes that are used in the already described manner, for providing the same of a visualizing means and solving ordinary as well as difficult or emergency intubations.The aim set forth is reached by means of the device according to the present invention, mainly consisting of an ocular connected to an optic fibre sheathed in a means for moving the visualizing end, that may be applied, by means of a connection element, between the handle and the blade of the laryngoscope, so that said 

 optic fibre, sliding along the blade through two guides or similar, arrives to the larynx, directly visualizing said larynx and its aditus, even in those cases in which this process is impossible with the direct vision, thus solving the problem of difficult and, at present, impossible intubations.The device according to the present

CLAIMS
1. A visualization device with optic fibres that may be applied to laryngoscopes, according to the present invention, characterized in:
- an ocular (1) for the external visualization of what has been framed by the optic fibre (2); an optic fibre (2) linked to said ocular (1) and sheathed with a means (4) for moving its end (3); a means (4) for moving the end (3) of said optic fibre (2), consisting in a double pulling thread (7) of harmonic steel or similar, operated by a lever (5) and/or by a knob (6) so as to determine movements that allow the visualization of the larynx and its aditus; a connecting means (8), provided with shapes (9) and (10), corresponding to those existing on the laryngoscope (L), for the joint of the handle (M) and the blade (LA) so as to be applied between said two components (M) and (LA); a means for the application of the optic fibre (2) along said blade (LA), consisting of two elastic rings (11) . 


2. A visualizing device with optic fibres according to claim 1, characterized in that said optic fibre (2) is used through the oral cavity and not through the nose and is applied by means of elements (11) to said blade (LA).
