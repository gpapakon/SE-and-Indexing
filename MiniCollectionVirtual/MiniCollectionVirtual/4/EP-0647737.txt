<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an improved press felt 
conditioning treatment which controls the deposition of poly(amino-amide) 

- epichlorohydrin type resins in a press felt. The treatment 
comprises applying to the felt an effective inhibiting amount of a 

conditioner consisting of: an ethoxylated nonylphenol having greater 
than about 30 moles of ethoxylation; sodium n-hexadecyl diphenyloxide 

disulfonate; a fatty acid imidazoline or an alkylamidopropyldimethylamine 
which include an alkyl hydrophobe substituent having a 

carbon chain length of about 18.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inhibiting contamination
of felts of a papermaking system. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a press felt conditioner which controls
contamination by wet strength resins.In several types of papermaking processes, water soluble
wet strength resins are added to the pulp furnish to increase the
end use wet strength properties of the paper products. Items
such as paper towels, napkins and tissues as well as other
specialty paper grades are formed from pulp furnish which
includes wet strength resins. These wet strength resins enhance
the strength of the end product when wet. Wet strength resins which allow the end product paper to
retain more than 15% and up to 50% of its dry strength when wet are
well known in the papermaking art. Various types of wet strength
resins include ureaformaldehyde, melamine-formaldehyde, polyacrylamide,
poly(aminoamide)-epichlorohydrin resins and their complex
derivatives which are employed as pulp furnish components. The
poly(aminoamide)-epichlorohydrin (PAE) type resins have become the
most commercially important thermosetting resins and dominate the
current paper wet strength resin market. PAE resins are water
soluble cationic polymers which are typically added to the pulp
furnish at an intermediate degree of polymerization so that the
final cure of the polymer occurs in the dryer section of the paper
machine. PAE resins are used extensively because they are neutral
to alkaline curing, they impart permanent wet strength properties
and they provide long shelf life. Also, because PAE resins are
water soluble cationic polymers, they are effectively retained on
anionic cellulosic fibers. By water soluble, it is meant that the
resins are water soluble at the time they are added to the
papermaking furnish. Subsequent events such as crosslinking can
render the resins insoluble in water. Wet strength resins are
generally believed to undergo crosslinking or other curing reaction
after they have been deposited on, within, or among the papermaking
fibers. The manufacture of paper typically involves the processing
of a carefully prepared aqueous fiber suspension (the pulp furnish)
containing chemical additives to produce a highly uniform dry
paper. Three steps included in the typical paper process are sheet
forming where the suspension is directed over a porous synthetic
mesh or "wire"; sheet pressing, where a formed sheet is passed
through presses covered with belt-like porous felts to extract
retained water from the sheet and to

<CLAIMS>
The use of an effective inhibiting amount of a press felt conditioner,
applied to a press felt of a papermaking system, as an inhibitor

against the deposition of poly(amido-amine)-epichlorhydrin type
resins in said press felt, the conditioner being selected from the

group:

ethoxylated nonylphenol having more than about 30 moles of

ethoxylation;
sodium n-hexadecyl diphenyloxide disulfonate; and
alkylamidopropyldimethylamines of the general formula:


wherein R is saturated, unsaturated, monounsaturated or
branched alkyl hydrophobe radical having a carbon chain

length of about 18.
A use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
pH of the system is from about 6.5 to about 8.0.
A use as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
said press felt is conditioned by showering with an

aqueous medium including said felt conditioner.
A use as claimed in claim 3, wherein said
press felt conditioner is present in an amount of from

about 15 to about 1,200 parts per million parts said
aqueous medium.
A use as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the press felt conditioner is

an alkylamidopropyldimethylamine of the general
formula:



wherein R is an saturated, unsaturated, monounsaturated
or branched alkyl hydrophobe radical having a carbon

chain length of about 18.
