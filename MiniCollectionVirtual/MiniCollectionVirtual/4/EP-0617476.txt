<ABSTRACT>
A filter used for radio communication equipment, whose characteristics 
are not deteriorated because the no-load Q of the strip line resonator 

is high. The filter comprises a base (4) having first and second electromagnetically-coupled 
strip lines (5) and (6) on the front side, and an earth pattern 

(2) on the reverse side, a dielectric layer (8) stacked on the front side 
of the base (4), and provided with capacitor patterns (9) and (10) on the 

front side facing the aforesaid first and second strip lines (5) and (6) with 
the dielectric layer (8) therebetween; and a metal cap (1) covering the dielectric 

layer (8). A conduction film which is connected to the earth pattern 
(2) on the reverse side is provided on a part of the edge of the base (4). At 

least a part of the outer periphery of the metal cap (1) extends to this conduction 
film and is connected to it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter employed
in mobile communication apparatuses such as cordless
telephones, portable telephones and the like as well as a
method of manufacturing the same.A structure of this type filter known heretofore
(e.g. from JP-A-03-71710) is shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14.
In Fig. 13, numerals 70 to 76 denote green sheets of a
dielectric material, wherein the green sheets 71 and 72 are
provided with electrodes 77, 78, 79, 80 for capacitors. On
the other hand, the green sheet 74 is provided with
electrodes 81 and 82 for coils, while the green sheet 76 is
provided with shielding electrodes 83 and 84. The green
sheets 70-76 shown in Fig. 13 are laminated and subsequently
fired at such a temperature at which the electrodes 77-84
(e.g. of silver or copper) do not make disappearance,
whereby these sheets are integrated in such a structure as
shown in Fig. 14. In Fig. 14, numerals 85 and 86 denote
input/output terminals. Thus, in the filter known
heretofore, capacitors are formed by the electrodes 77-80
disposed in opposition, while coils are formed by the 
electrodes 81 and 82, wherein the filter is constituted by
these capacitors and coils.A problem of the prior art filter described above
is seen in that satisfactory filter characteristics can not
be obtained because unloaded Q of a resonator comprising
the capacitor and the coil can not be made high. More
specifically, referring to Fig. 13, since the green sheets
70 to 76 are allowed to be fired only at a temperature at
which the electrodes 77-84 can not disappear, significant
dielectric loss is incurred, as a result of which a constant
indicating low loss of the resonator (unloaded Q) assumes
a small value. Consequently, the filter comprising the
resonators each having low unloaded Q suffers significant
insertion loss in the pass-band with the characteristic in
the attenuation band being damped. Thus, it is impossible
to use the filter in such applications in which the
requirement for the characteristic requirement is severe.Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to prevent the filter characteristics from
degradation by increasing unloaded Q of the resonator.For achieving the above object, there is proposed
according to the present invention a filter
as defined in claims 1 and 3 and manufacturing methods therefor
as defined in claims 12 and 13. A filter according to the
preamble of claim 1 is known from document JP-A-61258503. A
filter according to the preamble of claim 3 is known from
document EP-A1-0506476,
