<ABSTRACT>
Drive sprocket for chain saws, comprising an outer ring (11) transmitting force on its outside (13) to a chain and with a large internal gear surface (15) on its inside meshing with a smaller external gear surface (16) on the drive shaft or on an inner ring (17) supported by the drive shaft, and one or more distance elements (19, 20, 24, 27) maintaining the center of the outer ring (11) at a certain distance from the center of the drive shaft, allowing the center of the outer ring to move along a curved path around the drive shaft to compensate for changes in chain length and to automatically ensure a tension force in the chain.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DRIVE SPROCKET FOR CHAIN SAWSBackgroundExcessive wear and hazards are unwanted results when the average tension in a saw chain occasionally becomes so low that the chain is no longer safely guided in contact with the guidebar. This will lead to sharp tension peaks in the chain and impacts against the guidebar, or the chain can leave the groove in the guidebar or the drive sprocket.To avoid this, chain saws have long been made with guidebars which after mounting of the saw chain can be moved forward relative to the drive sprocket to create tension in the chain, and with means to lock the guidebars in this position. Wear and heating during use will lengthen the chain, however, and even a small elongation will lower the tension considerably. The cutting forces in severe use will also lengthen the chain elastically, resulting in lower tension in the upper outgoing part of the chain.It has long been known from the patents US 1,016,664 and US 2,316,997 to make the guidebar slidingly movable in use, acted upon by a spring to ensure a constant sum of the tension in the outgoing and ingoing parts of the chain. Disadvantages are that friction and wear will be as large in idling as in cutting, and that impacts against the nose part of a movable guidebar may push it back and lower the tension in the chain.The invention concerns a drive sprocket to be mounted on the power head of chain saws, designed to make the tension in the chain proportional to the sum of friction and cutting forces, making it high while cutting when high tension is needed, and making it low while idling to avoid unnecessary wear. 

 Description of the inventionThe invention is described with reference to the figures, where figure 1 shows an axial section through a drive sprocket, figure 2 a perspective view of a partly disassembled drive sprocket, figures 3 and 4 sections through alternative forms of drive sprockets and figure 5 shows in principle the relations between the forces acting on a part of the saw chain.A drive sprocket according to the invention comprises an outer ring (11) having on its outside (13) indentations (12) corresponding to the drive links of the saw chain. The indentations may be only slightly wider than the thickness of the drivelinks, with the side links of the chain being carried by the outside (13) of the outer ring, or they could be substantially as wide as the outer ring, with the side links being carried by the ridges (14) between the indentations (12) . The inside of the outer ring (11) is shaped as a large
