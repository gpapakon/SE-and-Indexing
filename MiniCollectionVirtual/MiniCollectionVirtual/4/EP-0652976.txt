<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus for collecting and processing tissue to produce an endothelial cell product having a vessel (11) for rinsing, draining, digesting and isolating tissue. The vessel (11) has a rinsing and digesting chamber (19) for containing tissue during processing. An inlet (20) in the rinsing and digesting chamber (19) allows entry of rinsing solution and tissue from a liposuction device. A waste chamber (22) in fluid communication with the rinsing and digesting chamber (19) preferably connects with a vacuum source. An isolation chamber (29) is separated from the rinsing and digesting chamber (19) by a screen (30). An ampule (31) in fluid communication with the isolation chamber (29) includes a pair of ports (34, 35) controlled by valve devices (37, 45) to be selectively in fluid communication with the isolation chamber (29). After processing, the ampule (31) isolates a pellet of endothelial cells and the valve devices (37, 45) permit the pellet to be in fluid communication with the ports (34, 35). The method includes providing the vessel (11), introducing tissue to be processed, orienting the vessel (11) to screen the tissue, introducing an enzyme and agitating to digest the tissue, centrifuging the vessel to transfer the cells from the digested tissue, and isolating the cells for retrieval.
