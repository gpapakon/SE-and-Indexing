<ABSTRACT>
A diagnostic and therapeutic apparatus for re-educating the posture of the backbone includes in combination means for controlling the orthostatic posture of the patient, means for carrying out a differential traction on the same patient at different levels in order to cancel out all or a part of his weight, means for correcting the postural defects in the three planes of the space and for blocking the patient within postural limits in order to prevent him from assuming postures other than that therapeutic even during the deambulation. In particular, the orthostatic posture is controlled by measuring the weight resting on each foot of the patient through footboards (19A, 19B) sensitive to changes in pressure placed under a travelling band (18), and the traction means are lacings or traction slings (24) slidable around pulleys (22) carried by a rigid framework and put under tension manually by the operator or automatically by a microprocessor receiving data measured from the footboard (19A, 19B) sensitive to changes in pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
re-educating the posture of the backbone of an individual 
in all of the three plane of the space, i.e. frontal, 
sagittal, and transversal, thus avoiding the posture 
defects and all of the pathologic consequences arising 
threfrom, under antigravity, dynamic conditions and 
through deambulation on a travelling band. As known, the weight of the human body is supported by 
the skeleton, muscles, ligaments, and fasciae. The line 
representing that weight goes down from above along the 
backbone, bifurcates at the third lumbar vertebra, turns 
to the two opposite coxae (hip-joints), goes down along 
the lower limbs and goes up again by the same way until 
it rejoins at the centre of the pubic bone to form a 
closed loop of forces. However, skeleton is very seldom 
postured in a physiologically correct way so as to absorb 
the most of the weight of the human body. Actually men 
assume comfort postures or postural bad habits requiring 
the aid of supports constituted by muscular tensions, 
fasciae, and ligaments to restore the balance. 
Such "dynamic compensations" of a "static defect" become 
permanent in time such as to constitute a pseudo scheme 
of movement (the automatic total scheme of movements) 
that, even if it is not physiologically correct, becomes 
definitively functional, thus causing pathologic 
modifications in capsules, ligaments and joint surfaces  
 
and occurrence of aches and pains of different nature and 
intensity. 
The physiatrics is aware of such problem for some time so 
that several equipment have been manufactured to try to 
solve it. The latter, however, have never considered the 
"global problem", i.e. the functional and dynamic whole 
of the human body. From FR-A-2 252 108 it is known an apparatus for re-education 
of the human backbone comprising means for 
carrying out differential traction at different levels, 
means for correcting the postural defects and for blocking 
the patient and means for allowing the patient to 
walk. However this apparatus does not permit both a 
diagnostics investigations of postural defects and a 
programmed treatment since there is no means of 
monitoring the orthostatic position of the patient. 
It is already known from the Biomedizinische Technik 
Vol.32 October 1987, the possibility to control the 
weight resting on each patient's foot lying on a 
footboards to investigate the standing and walking motor 
control and to value neuromuscular diseases without the 
possibility of corrections. The

A diagnostic and therapeutic apparatus for 
reeducating the posture of the human backbone 

comprising, in combination, 
means (24, 25) for 

carrying out a differential traction on the same 
patient at different levels in order to cancell out 

all or a part of his weight, means (28, 30, 32, 12) 
for correcting the postural defects by leading the 

patient again to the respect of the symmetries in the 
three planes of the space and for blocking the 

patient within postural limits inside which he is 
free but from which he cannot come out, and means 

(18) for allowing the patient to walk in his 
tridimensionally corrected hanging posture in order 

to force him to the new automatic scheme of movements 
adapted to the incidental situation, characterized in 

that it further comprises means (19A, 19B) for monitoring the 
orthostatic posture of the patient by measuring the weight resting 

on each foot of a standing or walking subject, and a microprocessor and 
in that the means (19A, 19B) for measuring the weight 

resting on each foot of the subject is adapted to feed data to the 
microprocessor controlling automatically the 

operation of the traction means (24, 25) for leading 
the subject to a predetermined postural scheme. 
The diagnostic and therapeutic apparatus as 
claimed in the preceding claims, characterized in 

that the means (19A, 19B) for measuring the weight 
resting on each foot of the subject are footboards 

sensitive to changes in pressure or load cells placed 
under the walking surface of a travelling or slidable  

 
band (18). 
The diagnostic and therapeutic apparatus as 
claimed in the preceding claims, characterized in 

that the traction means are lacings or traction 
slings (24) adjustable in length and slidable around 

pulleys (22) carried by a frame (8, 10, 12) which can 
be firmly anchored to the floor and/or to the ceiling 

of the operational room, and put under tension by 
electric, mechanical or hydraulic devices (25). 
The diagnostic and therapeutic apparatus as 
claimed in the preceding claims, characterized in 

that said traction slings (24) are designed to the 
treatment of the subject through five suspension 

points, and namely one at the cranium, two at the 
thorax, and two at the ischium (inguen).

postural defects and for blocking the subject within 

postural limits are a number of stops (28) which are

predetermined points by vertically shifting and

of sleeves (32) along the uprights (12) of the

point attached to the patient's body in the space is additionally
