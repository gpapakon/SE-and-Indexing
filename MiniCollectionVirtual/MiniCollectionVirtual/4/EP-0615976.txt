<DESCRIPTION>
Each year, approximately one third of the 
world's crops are destroyed by plant pests, amounting 
to billions of dollars in crop losses in the united 
States alone. Plants are susceptible to diseases and 
damage caused by an enormous number of different types 
of organisms, including virus, bacteria, fungi, algae, 
parasitic plants, weeds, insects, arachnids, and 
nematodes. The potential losses are kept in check by 
natural controlling mechanisms, and when these systems 
fail, by applications of various types of insecticides 
which typically act by attaching one specific, genetically 
controlled aspect of the target organism's 
metabolism. However, the efficacy of any given pesticide 
may be limited by the appearance and spread of 
resistance to the pesticide among the target population. 
The appearance and spread of insecticide resistance 
in wild populations argues for a genetic origin. 
First, a resistant genotype or trait appears in a local 
population and then with continued insecticide use (and 
thus, disproportionate survival of individuals with 
this genotype or trait), the resistance rapidly increases 
in the population and via migration resistance 
may spread to regional and perhaps even worldwide 
populations. Resistance may arise as a genetic allele 
already present within a population, or it may arise  denovo. Nonetheless, whatever the cause, in a population 
with a short generation time (which is characteristic 
of many insects), the resistance trait can spread 
rapidly and quickly render ineffective the planned 
pattern of pesticide application. The continued development of natural strategies 
for insect control could be enhanced by an understanding 
of the genetic basis of the resistance in 
economically important pests. Such studies have been 
ongoing, particularly with regard to insect pests, and 
a great deal has been learned about the major types of 
resistance observed in insects. At least three types 
of insect resistance have been identified: decreased 
rate of uptake, increased rate or degradation and 
changes in the target site. To some extent, certain 
aspects of the genetic mechanisms of these types of 
resistance have been determined; however, knowledge of 
the specific genetic basis for resistance has not yet 
been effectively applied in the field to monitor the 
occurrence of resistance, or to assist in planning 
effective insecticide applications to avoid or alleviate 
the development of resistance. Modification of 
insecticide application patterns can be critical in 
case
