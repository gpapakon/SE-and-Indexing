<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for the free radical copolymerization of a mixture of olefins and a 
polar monomer is disclosed. The process requires the catalytic isomerization of internally-unsaturated 

olefins to terminally-unsaturated olefins during the copolymerization reaction. The 
process results in improved yields in terms of solid product formation and in lower costs than 

conventional processes. The process is especially useful for the preparation of diisobutylenemaleic 
anhydride copolymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for the copolymerization of polar
monomers with mixtures of olefins. The olefins of this invention are always monounsaturated
olefins. The olefin mixtures contain monounsaturated olefins in which the carbon to carbon
double bond is between a carbon atom at the end of the molecule and the adjacent carbon,
referred to hereinafter as terminal unsaturation, and monounsaturated olefins in which the
carbon to carbon double bond is between carbons that are not at the end of the molecule, referred
to herein as non-terminal unsaturation. Olefins containing non-terminal unsaturation are
unreactive in free radical copolymerizations. The present invention relates to a process for
isomerizing such non-terminal unsaturation in situ during the copolymerization of the olefin
mixture with polar monomers.Monounsaturated olefins are molecules containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms and
without aryl groups and without any functional group, such as halogen, carboalkoxy and the
like, and further containing only one carbon-carbon double bond. It has been known for many
years that the free-radical-initiated copolymerization of monounsaturated olefins is truly
satisfactory only with monomers which have high "e" values. An "e" value of a monomer is a
measure of the polarity of the monomer, or more accurately the electron-attracting or electron-donating
attributes of the substituents on the monomer. The "e" values are calculated numbers,
but are based on copolymerization data. They range from -1.58 for vinyl t-butyl ether, a
monomer with electron-donating functionality to about 0 for a non-polar material with no
electron-donating or -withdrawing groups (ethylene) to + 2.25 for a highly polar material, such
as maleic anhydride and the like, which usually contain two strongly electron-withdrawing
groups . The Q-e calculations are well-known to the polymer art and are found, inter alia, in
"Polymer Handbook, 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, 1989, page II-267. In order for a
monounsaturated olefin to effectively copolymerize with a polar monomer, the "e" value of the
polar molecule must be at least about + 1.2.Relatively few polar monomers have high enough "e" values (at least + 1.2) to form
alternating copolymers with non-functionalized monoolefins. Useful polar monomers, which
usually contain two strongly electron-withdrawing groups, include maleic anhydride,
maleimide, N-substituted maleimides, a-cyanoacrylate esters, vinylidene cyanide, and the like.
Of these, maleic anhydride is
