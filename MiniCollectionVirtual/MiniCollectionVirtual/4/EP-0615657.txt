<ABSTRACT>
In a combiner filter for a cellular telephone system, there is a coaxial resonator which includes a rectangular cavity. Within the rectangular cavity, there is a central conductor having an oval shaped plate. The central conductor and oval shaped plate are displaced within the rectangular cavity to establish the fundamental resonator frequency. Adjacent to the central conductor plate is a rotatable I-beam shaped element which is preferably rotated by a shaft coupled to a stepper motor. The rotation of the I-beam shaped element provides frequency adjustment or tuning for the coaxial resonator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tuning
arrangement for coaxial radio frequency (RF) combiner
filters, and more especially to Î»/4 resonators, e.g. as disclosed in US 4389624A.A coaxial resonator includes a cavity such as a
rectangularly shaped cavity, and the cavity's fundamental
frequency, referred to as f0, is usually set by selecting
the relationship between a center conductor and the
center conductor's closing cover (cap) which are disposed
within the cavity. The closing cover and the opposite
wall of the resonator cavity constitute the plates of a
capacitor. The RF input signal, which is input to the
cavity, produces an electric field between these
capacitor plates and a magnetic field that is orthogonal
to the electric field with maximum strength around the
center conductor. The resonator's fundamental frequency
is strongly determined by the center conductor's closing
cover. The area of the closing cover determines the
capacitance. The resonator is usually tuned, i.e., the
resonator's fundamental frequency is selected, by
adjusting the length of the center conductor, thereby
changing the capacitance. This tuning is usually
accomplished indirectly by moving an adjustment screw
disposed in opposition to the center conductor. A
pick-up loop, which is usually situated on one of the
resonator's walls, is provided in the resonator. The
loop picks up the tuned signal frequency (for setting the
resonator, this frequency is the desired f0).U.S. Patent 4,389,624 discloses a conventional coaxial
resonator which includes an outer conductor with
closed and open ends. An inner conductor is
concentrically disposed within the outer conductor to
establish a short circuit at the closed end and an open
circuit at the open end. A dielectric member is
mounted in the open circuit between the outer and
inner conductors. An electrode is connected to the
open circuit end of the inner conductor with a spacing
from the dielectric member. A conductive plate, having
a smaller surface area than that of the electrode but
larger than the transverse cross-sectional area of the
inner conductor, is provided between the dielectric
member and the electrode. The dimensions of the
conductive plate is appropriately chosen to
accommodate frequency variations which might occur
as a result of a connection with an external circuit.A conventional microwave resonator is disclosed in
U.S. Patent 4,521,754. The microwave resonator
includes an enclosed resonator housing and a hollow
central conductor having one end fastened to a bottom
of the
