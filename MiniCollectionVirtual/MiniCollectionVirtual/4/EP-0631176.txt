<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photothermographic
materials and in particular to stabilisers and
antifoggants for use therein.Heat-developable photosensitive materials which can
produce photographic images using a dry heat processing
method (referred to herein as "photothermographic
materials") are known and described for example, in US
Patent Nos. 3152904 and 3457075 and in "Thermally
Processed Silver Systems" by D. Morgan and B. Shely,
"Imaging Processes and Materials", Neblettes's Eighth
edition; Edited by J.M. Sturge, V. Walworth and A. Shepp,
p.2 (1969). Such photothermographic materials have a
photosensitive medium comprising a reducible silver
source, e.g. an organic silver salt; a catalytic amount
of photocatalyst, e.g., silver halide, in reactive
association with the reducible silver source, and a
reducing agent for silver ion, ordinarily dispersed in an
(organic) binder matrix. Although stable at ambient
temperatures, when heated to higher temperatures, e.g.,
80Â°C, or higher, after imagewise exposure, silver is
produced in the exposed regions of the medium via a redox
reaction between the reducible silver source and the
reducing agent. This redox reaction is accelerated by
the catalytic action of the exposure-generated silver
catalyst. The silver provides a black image which
contrasts with the unexposed areas, resulting in the
formation of an image.In practice, it is essential to include an effective
antifoggant in such photothermographic materials, since
without an antifoggant, some generation of silver in the
unexposed areas takes place upon thermal development,
resulting in a poor differential between image and
background fog. In addition, one of the problems of
photothermographic materials involves their post-processing 
stability. Since the process is performed
without a fixing step, it is desirable to provide a means
to enable room light handling of the final image.Polybrominated organic compounds have been described
as both antifoggants and image-stabilisers for
photothermographic materials since they can oxidise
reduced silver (fog) back to silver bromide under thermal
(anti-foggant) and light exposed (image stabiliser)
conditions.Examples of such compounds are described in US
4,546,075, US 4,452,885 (tribromomethylheterocycles as
anti-foggants), US 3874946 (tribromomethylsulphonylaromatics
as image stabilisers) and EP-A-0600587
(tribromomethylketones).Due to the thermal processing of the
photothermographic imaging material, all the compounds
used in the construction of the material will be
