<ABSTRACT>
An illustration and a description is given of a torsionally elastic shaft coupling which consists essentially of a coupling flange (11) to be arranged on the drive side, a hub (12) to be arranged on the output side, engaging axially in a central opening of the coupling flange and intended for connection to a shaft, and of a number of rubber-elastic, in particular elongate coupling bodies (13). In this arrangement, the central opening (14) of the coupling flange (11) and the hub each have, on the inside and outside respectively, an essentially polygonal outline, engage in one another with a symmetrical offset relative to one another in the circumferential direction, without making contact, and the elastic coupling bodies (13) are inserted into the free spaces formed by the circumferential offset between the hub (12) and the coupling flange (11). In order to be able to connect such a coupling to the associated units in the axial direction in a simplified manner, either the hub (12) is assigned an outer sleeve (15) or the opening of the coupling flange is assigned an inner sleeve (16), on which the elastic coupling bodies are supported on the inside or the outside, and the sleeve forms with the hub or the opening of the coupling flange a torsionally rigid axial sliding fit which considerably facilitates assembly and disassembly in the axial direction of the coupling system.

Shaft coupling, essentially consisting of a coupling 
flange (11) disposed at the drive end and a hub (12), disposed 

at the driven end, which is intended for connection to a shaft 
and engages axially in a central recess (14) of the coupling 

flange (11), and a number of flexible, particularly rope-type, 
coupling elements (13), the central recess (14) of the 

coupling flange (11) and the hub (12) each having, on the 
inside and outside, respectively, an essentially polygonal 

profile and engaging without contact, being symmetrically 
displaced relative to each other in the circumferential 

direction, and the flexible coupling elements (13) being 
inserted in the clear spaces formed by the circumferential 

offset between the hub (12) and the coupling flange (11), 
characterized in that the hub (12) is provided with an outer 

sleeve (15) or the coupling flange recess (14) is provided 
with an inner sleeve (16) against the outside and inside of 

which, respectively, the flexible coupling elements (13) are 
supported and in that the sleeve (15; 16) forms a rotationally 

rigid fit, capable of sliding axially, with the hub (12) or 
with the coupling flange recess (14). 
Coupling according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the sleeve (15; 16) is made from a plastics material such as, 

in particular, polyamide. 
Coupling according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the hub (12) and/or the sleeve (15; 16) is made from 

drawn material. 
Coupling according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the coupling flange (11) is made from a plastics material, 

particularly a fibre-reinforced plastics material, and its 
inner sleeve (16) is made from metal.  

 
Coupling according to Claim 1 or any one of the 
subsequent claims, characterized in that the polygon sides 

(20) of the sleeve (15) assigned to the hub (12), which are 
intended to act as bearing faces for the elastic coupling 

elements, are preformed outwards and are essentially levelled 
by the action of the radial prestress forces of the coupling 

elements (13).
