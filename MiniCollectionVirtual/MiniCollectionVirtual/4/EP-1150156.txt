<DESCRIPTION>
This invention broadly relates to systems for spatial homogenization of light beams and more particularly to systems for homogenizing such beams, for instance laser beams, while at the same time an output is obtained with variable cross-section.As it is well known, in many applications in which high intensity light beams are utilized, for instance laser beams designed for thermal and/or ablative treatments of surfaces, an accurate energy (or power) density on the working spot as well as a very high spatial uniformity are required, in order that any intensity fluctuations be maintained within a limit of 10%. The radiation emitted by any light source has an intrinsic point to point disuniformity, particularly when a laser radiation is involved, due to the fact that the light beam as emitted by most laser sources has an intensity spatial profile that is not constant along a transversal direction, due to principles related to the physics of the sources of this type. The sole system adapted to enhance the spatial homogeneity of a light source without jeopardizing the emitted energy provides for optically manipulating the concerned light radiation by means of a lens and/or mirror system.Many optical systems are commercially available adapted to intercept a light beam having known dimensions and to convert its current dimensions into other dimensions of pre-established values while at the same time they assure a high spatial uniformity, that is low point to point fluctuations of the light intensity.Most of the existing optical systems adapted to operate in such a way as to make the intensity distribution of the light beam more uniform have the drawback that, when the energy (or power) emitted from the source is established, the final dimensions of the beam and consequently the exploitable energy (or power) density are strictly determined. As a consequence of this, the various applications of light beams with uniform intensity distribution require different dedicated optical systems depending on the desired final dimensions of the light beams.In this sense, the present invention is innovative in view of its flexibility (due to the fact that, even if the parameters of its components are established, it enables the dimensions of the final beam to be varied in a large range of values, so that it can be exploited in applications requiring spatial homogeneous light beams having variable dimensions and an arbitrarily selectable energy (or power) density) and also in view of its simplicity (as it requires the smallest
