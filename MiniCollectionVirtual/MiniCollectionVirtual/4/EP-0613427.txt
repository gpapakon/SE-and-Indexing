<ABSTRACT>
A circuitry is disclosed for traction current supply rectifier substations having a central rectifier unit that may be controlled, semi-controlled or non-controlled. The line exit is supplied by a quick disconnector (13, 14) whose pole on the side of the line is linked to a coupling subassembly (6, 7) that leads through two looped lines (20, 21) to a switching arrangement (9) composed for example of a switching thyristor (12) and at least one turn-off arm and coupling diodes with a direct current bus bar (3). When a central thyristor semi-block (1) is available, it further contains its own turn-off arrangement (8). This circuitry is suitable for all rectifier substations having a direct current bus bar.
