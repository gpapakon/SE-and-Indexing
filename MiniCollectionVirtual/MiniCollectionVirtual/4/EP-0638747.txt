<ABSTRACT>
Subsea pipelines have to be supported on the seafloor when any free 
span, due to the unevenness of the seabed, is longer than acceptable. 

The support comprises a lower leg (6) sliding within an upper leg (5) 
and being operated by screws (8). An interface panel (10) provided with 

standard connecting terminals (11) with releasable connectors (12) is 
fixed to the support. Flexible torque-conveying drives in the form of 

steel cables transmit torque from the terminals (11) to the screws (8). 
Remote-operated vehicles are connected to the terminals (11) for 

adjusting the height of the support above the seafloor.

<DESCRIPTION>
With gas and oil being searched for in ever deeper 
waters, and since known techniques cannot cope at such 
depths, new ones had to be developed in lieu of the use of 
divers. An example involves span-supporting systems for rigid 
subsea pipelines carrying the oil and gas produced. Such 
subsea pipelines have to be supported whenever any free span 
of pipe, arising out of the unevenness of the sea bed, is 
longer than that allowed for under the design. The kind of conventional supporting used until recently 
has had limited use because divers have had to be employed to 
do the work, as for example when torque had to be applied at 
predetermined points to raise the sliding supporting devices 
for rigid pipelines. In order to be able to support rigid 
pipelines at depths beyond those at which divers can work, 
new techniques are being developed that do not require the 
work of divers. One of the solutions currently employed is to let down 
to the sea bed hydraulic units together with the mechanical 
rigid pipeline supports. Such hydraulic units provide the 
hydraulic power for the hydraulic motors installed close to 
the points where torque is to be applied, such motors 
producing the torque required at each such point and thereby  
 
enabling the whole arrangement to be put into action. This solution is fraught with several disadvantages, 
such as the high cost of the hydraulic units, of the hydraulic 
motors, of the connections, and of the umbilicals that 
have to feed the hydraulic unit down at the sea bottom with 
power from the support vessel at the surface, plus the 
problems brought about by a subsea system operating at high 
ambient (water) pressures. Another solution also currently employed is to use 
remote-controlled vehicles. Upon development of technology 
for the use of such remote-controlled vehicles for jobs which 
until then had been done by divers, it became feasible and 
relatively cheaper to make greater use of the various kinds 
of equipment needed to produce oil and gas at depths quite a 
lot greater than before. However, because of the complex geometry usually 
encountered in the equipment of the various sorts of subsea 
systems employed in the search for, and production of, oil 
and gas, there is always the risk of a remote-controlled 
vehicle becoming trapped in the course of its subsea work, as 
for instance when torque has to be applied at points difficult 
to access. Another drawback to consider is the delay 
incurred by the remote-controlled vehicle when torque has to 
be
