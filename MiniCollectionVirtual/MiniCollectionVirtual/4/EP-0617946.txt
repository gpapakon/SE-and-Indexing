<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a fluidised bed mattress (10), in particular for medical use, of the type including a tank (12) which is open at its upper surface, in which a dense suspension of particles is created in an ascending fluid stream and which is covered by at least one covering canvas (cloth) (24), characterised in that it includes integrated means (26) for decontamination of the particles, which means consist, for example, of electrical resistors (26) which make it possible to decontaminate the particles by heating them.

<CLAIMS>
Fluidised bed mattress (10), in particular for medical 
use, of the type comprising a tank (12), open on its upper side, 

in which is created a dense suspension of particles in an 
ascending current of fluid and which is covered by at least one 

covering cloth (24), and integrated means for the decontamination 
of the particles, characterised in that the decontamination means 

(26) are integrated in the tank and, comprise heating means 
comprising electrical elements (26) arranged in the tank (12), 

in situ in the mass of particles and means for supplying 
electrical power to the elements (26). 
Fluidised bed mattress according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the elements (26) extend longitudinally inside the tank 

(12). 
Fluidised bed mattress according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that the elements (26) are supported by a perforated 

intermediate plate (28) arranged in the tank (12). 
Fluidised bed mattress according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the intermediate plate (28) comprises parts (30) in 

relief with respect to its general plane, which supports the 
elements (26). 
Fluidised bed mattress according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the heating means comprise elements, each 

in the shape of a hair-pin, which extend parallel to each other 
from one end face (16) of the tank (12) and which are connected 

in parallel. 
Fluidised bed mattress according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the means for supplying electrical power 

comprise a thermostatic regulation circuit (54) comprising a 
probe (50) for the decontamination temperature.  

 
Fluidised bed mattress according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the means for supplying electrical power 

comprise means (62) for displaying the decontamination 
temperature. 
Fluidised bed mattress according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the means for supplying electrical power 

comprise at least one safety device (56, 58, 60) for controlling 
the operation of the heating means (26).
