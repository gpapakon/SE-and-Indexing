<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to methods of producing a fixed or removable tooth prosthesis comprising a single element or multiple elements in the region of the frontal and lateral teeth between two pillar elements which are left as intact as possible. It is not absolutely necessary for the pillar elements to be free of restorations at the point of attachment of the structure. For the structure, an individually cast plate of a metal of choice (1) provided with an opening of defined dimensions at the approximal side at the level of the contact point of the pillar is fastened on the particular pillar by means of the etch-bonding technique. Thereupon, an oval adapter piece (3) (17) having a wedge-shaped or undercutting loop-shaped incision in its top side and a tapering opening in the middle is provided with a screw thread and cast on, welded on or cemented. A moveable-cut metal pin (8) is guided through the coinciding openings of the oval adapter piece and the plate and cemented in the small channel prepared in the pillar element (20). The pin is secured from the outside with a securing screw (12) which is tightened with a screwing instrument in the appropriate depression (15) in the top side of the screw. At the same time, the hemispherical base (13) of the securing screw fits in the concave surface (11) of the countersunk pin head.

Device for anchoring a removable or fixed
tooth replacement between healthy or restored abutment

elements, consisting of at least one cast plate (1) made
of a metal, which is to be secured on the respective

abutment element by means of an etching/adhesive bonding
technique, characterized in that the plate (1) has an

opening and an oval adaptation piece (3, 17) is either
cast, welded or cemented onto the plate, which

adaptation piece has a concavely arched outside (5) and
an incision (4, 16) on its top edge, and also an opening

(6), in that a pin (8) is provided which is milled from
metal, is guided through the openings (2, 6) in the

plate and the adaptation piece, is movable therein and
is to be cemented into a prepared channel in the

abutment element, and in that the pin (8) is held in the
adaptation piece (3, 17) by a fastening screw (12).
Device according to Patent Claim 1,
characterized in that the incision (18) on the top of

the oval adaptation piece is loop-shaped and provides
engagement from below.
Device according to Patent Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the incision (4) on the top of the

oval adaptation piece is wedge-shaped.
Device according to Patent Claims 1, 2 and 3,
characterized in that the oval adaptation piece has a

semispherically tapering opening (6) at its centre.
Device according to Patent Claims 1, 2, 3 and
4, characterized in that there is a thread (7) in the 

oval adaptation piece, at the outer edge of the
semispherical opening.
Device according to Patent Claims 1, 2, 3, 4
and 5, characterized in that the pin head has a concave

surface (11) and a semispherical base (10), the pin
being milled in a single piece from metal.
Device according to Patent Claims 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 and 6, characterized in that the fastening screw has a

semispherical base (13).
Device according to Patent Claims 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 and 7, characterized in that the fastening screw is

provided with an attachment site (15) for the screwing
instrument.
Device according to Patent Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7 and 8, characterized in that the modelling cap

(21), as a modelling aid for a fixed tooth replacement,
has a convexly arched inner side (23) and a wedge-shaped

protuberance (22).
Device according to Patent Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8 and 9, characterized in that by means of the

transfer cap (26) which has a convexly arched inner side
(23), a loop-shaped protuberance (28) and bar-shaped

attachments (27) on the top, it is possible to produce
precise notches in the metal matrix for the purpose of

fixing a plastic lining (29).
Device according to Patent Claims 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, characterized in that a plastic

lining (29) with a convexly arched inner side (23), a
loop-shaped protuberance (28) and bar-shaped attachments

on the top (27), which are fitted into the corresponding
folds in the metal matrix, forms a patrix/matrix

structure for a removable tooth replacement.
