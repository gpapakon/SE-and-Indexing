<ABSTRACT>
Methods for making microporous membranes from vinylidene fluoride polymers and the products produced by these methods are described. The microporous membranes have a significantly faster flow rate at a given pore size as compared to equally-sized microporous membranes made by conventional procedures. The microporous membranes of the invention also can have significantly smaller pore sizes than conventional microporous polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes of the invention have unique macrostructural features responsible in part for their unique functional properties. The process includes dissolving the polymer in a liquid that includes a solvent and a co-solvent for the polymer. The dissolution of the polymer can be at temperatures ranging from about 20 DEG C to about 50 DEG C while the formation of the microporous membrane can be at temperatures ranging from about -10 DEG C to 50 DEG C. Selection of appropriate operating parameters of temperature and solvent/co-solvent concentration can optimize the membrane at a given nominal pore size, flow rate, and polymer distribution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the production of microporous polyvinylidene fluoride membranes.
In particular, the invention relates to the production of microporous
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes that differ
significantly in both their structural and functional
characteristics from conventional polyvinylidene fluoride
microporous membranes.Polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membranes,
generally formed as thin sheets of substantially uniform
thickness, have a sponge-like internal structure
containing millions of channels. These channels define a
tortuous flow path for liquids from one side of the
membrane sheet to the other side. Conventional methods of
producing these polyvinylidene fluoride (hereinafter
"PVDF") membranes result in membranes having a matrix of
intercommunicating channels, the channels having a
substantially uniform width within narrow limits.Microporous membranes act as screens or sieves and
retain on their surface all particles larger than the
given width of a channel (i.e. pore diameter). Entrapment
on the membrane surface of particles of approximately the
pore diameter will rapidly plug the membrane irreversibly,
leading to rapid decline in flow rate. Due to the
tortuous nature of the flow channels in conventional
microporous membranes, significant hydraulic pressure is
needed to force liquids from one side of the membrane to
the other. As the membranes clog, this pressure
necessarily increases.Conventionally-produced PVDF membranes are
commercially available with average pore sizes (i.e. pore
diameters) in the range from about 0.10 µm to about 
5.0 µm. The smallest of these conventional pore sizes
will retain some large viruses and most bacteria. However,
most viruses and some bacteria are not retained. In
addition, the smallest of these conventional pore sizes
will not retain large macromolecules. Attempts to produce
microporous membrane filters having pore sizes less than
about 0.10 µm have generally led to problems of very
slow flow because of the small pore size, and to problems
of rapid plugging.Conventional solvent-casting procedures for producing
microporous PVDF membranes rely on the use of a solvent
such as acetone for the PVDF polymer. Nevertheless,
acetone is usually not thought of as a solvent for this
particular polymer because it is exceedingly difficult to
dissolve any appreciable quantity of PVDF in acetone at
room temperature. In order to dissolve a sufficient
quantity to form an adequately viscous solution for use in
practising conventional methods, the
