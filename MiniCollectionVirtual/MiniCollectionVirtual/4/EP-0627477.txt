<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high amylose starch-based, water resistant,
alkaline corrugating adhesive with improved runnability or tack. More
particularly, this invention is directed to chemically treated high amylose raw
starch which is useful in alkaline corrugating adhesives and provides high levels
of water resistance while being operable at high corrugator running speeds.The term "corrugated paperboard" as used herein refers to a fluted medium
and a facing adhesively joined to the tips on one or both sides of the fluted
medium. The procedures employed in the production of corrugated paperboard
usually involve a continuous process whereby a strip of paperboard is first
corrugated by means of heated, fluted rolls. The protruding tips on one side of
this fluted paperboard strip are then coated with an adhesive, and a flat sheet
of paperboard, commonly known in the trade as a facing, is thereafter applied to
these tips. By applying heat and pressure to the two paperboard strips thus
brought together, an adhesive bond is formed therebetween. The above-described
procedure produces what is known to those skilled in the art as a single-faced
board in that the facing is applied to only one surface thereof. If a double-faced
paperboard in which an inner fluted layer sandwiched between two facings
is desired, a second operation is performed wherein the adhesive is applied to
the exposed tips of the single-faced board and the adhesive-coated tips are then
pressed against a second facing in the combining section of the corrugator under
the influence of pressure and heat. The typical corrugating process and the
operation and use of corrugators in general are described in US-A-2,051,025
and 2,102,937.A major concern in such processes is the selection of the appropriate
adhesive, as its properties will affect not only the strength and stability of
the final corrugated product, but also the parameters, such as corrugator speed,
within which the process can be operated. Thus, such adhesives are chosen in
light of the specific requirements of the process and the properties desired in 
the ultimate corrugated paperboard. The adhesives most commonly used in
corrugating are starch-based adhesives which are popular because of their
desirable adhesive properties, low cost and ease of preparation.The most fundamental of starch corrugating adhesives is an alkaline
adhesive which is comprised of ungelatinized raw starch suspended in an aqueous
dispersion of cooked starch (carrier). The adhesive is produced by gelatinizing
sta
