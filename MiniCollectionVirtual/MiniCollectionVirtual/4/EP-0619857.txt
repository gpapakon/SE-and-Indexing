<ABSTRACT>
An intercooler apparatus (C) for a supercharged control combustion engine comprises a heat exchanger (19) through which charged air for combustion passes prior to entry into a combustion chamber (17) of the engine, and means (20) to provide to the heat exchanger (19), coolant comprising air cooled to a temperature below ambient temperature which removes heat from the charged air.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an intercooler apparatus for a supercharged 
internal combustion engine. It will be appreciated that in charging air for use in an internal 
combustion engine, the air becomes compressed and therefore is heated. Intercoolers are known which cool charged air prior to the charged air 
entering the combustion chamber of the engine, thus to improve the efficiency of 
the engine. Arrangements are known for example from US 4736727 or EP-A-325209 
in which the charged air for an internal combustion engine of a vehicle 
is cooled by the action of air at ambient temperature passing a heat exchanger 
thereof, either as the vehicle moves, or due to the action of a fan. With such an 
arrangement, the charged air cannot be cooled below the ambient air 
temperature. Arrangements are also known, for example from Japanese patent 
application JP 61037523 in which refrigerant is circulated both to an air 
conditioning unit and to an air intercooler to cool charged air. This requires an 
unduly long refrigerant circuit and complicated control mechanisms. A system comprising an internal combustion engine, a supercharger for 
charging combustion air for the internal combustion engine, and an intercooler 
apparatus, the intercooler apparatus comprising a heat exchanger through which 
charged air for combustion passes prior to entry into the combustion chamber of 
the engine, characterised in that means are provided for providing to the heat 
exchanger of the intercooler apparatus coolant comprising air cooled to a 
temperature below ambient temperature, which thus removes heat from the 
charged air.  
 The cooled air may be cooled by a refrigeration unit which may be 
driven from the engine. For economic reasons, the refrigeration unit preferably is not dedicated 
solely to the intercooler apparatus, but rather preferably the refrigeration unit is 
operable otherwise to provide cooling for another application. For example the internal combustion engine may be controlled from 
an operator's cab and the refrigeration unit may be operable in addition to 
providing coolant air to the heat exchanger of the intercooler apparatus, to 
provide cooled air for the operator's cab. The cooled air for the intercooler apparatus may be bled from a 
cooled air feed between the refrigeration unit and the operator's cab or vice 
versa. Preferably though the refrigeration unit has a first cooled air outlet 
connected to the operator's cab and a second cooled air outlet which is connected 
to the heat exchanger of the
