<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a novel method for making a composite wire suitable for manufacturing hollow jewellery. According to the invention, this method is characterised in that it consists in:   - introducing a cylindrical bar of approximately circular cross-section made of base metal or of an alloy of base metals into a tube made of an alloy based on a precious metal preferably obtained by continuous casting and optionally drawn to the correct dimensions, said tube having an internal diameter greater than the external diameter of said bar;   - causing said tube and said bar to bond together; - wire-drawing the resulting assembly in order to give it a circular cross-section; - producing a lengthwise groove along this assembly, preferably during the last drawing pass, e.g. by scalping; and - optionally, chemically attacking said groove in order to make it more easily visible.   This method produces wire of great length having a coating of precious-metal-based alloys of uniform depth.
