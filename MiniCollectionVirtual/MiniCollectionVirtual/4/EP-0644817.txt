Injection-moulded plastic handle (H) for tools, in 
particular screwdriver, with zones of plastics with 

different hardness, of which the harder one is non-deformable 
by the forces occurring due to operational 

loading, but the softer one allows minor elastic 
deformation, and with a centrally located receiving cavity 

(5) for the tang (3) of a tool blade (2), wherein the 
central cavity (5) is located in a core portion (6) with a 

profiled peripheral surface (11), around which a casing (7) 
is injection-moulded, characterised in that the casing (7) 

is made of a harder material and comprises recesses (8) 
which result from profiling of the peripheral surface (11), 

and the recesses (8) are filled with a softer plastic until 
a more or less circular cross-sectional shape (18) is 

obtained. 
Injection-moulded plastic handle (H) for tools, in 
particular screwdriver, with zones of plastics with 

different hardness, of which the harder one is non-deformable 
by the forces occurring due to operational 

loading, but the softer one allows minor elastic 
deformation, and with a centrally located receiving cavity 

(104) for the tang of a tool blade, wherein the central 
cavity (104) is located in a core portion (102) around 

which a casing (101) made of a softer material is 
injection-moulded, wherein the recesses (111) resulting 

from profiling of the peripheral surface (102') are filled 
with the softer plastic of the casing until a more or less 

circular cross-sectional shape is obtained, characterised 
in that the core portion forms at least one, in particular 

two or four, radial predetermined breaking points (110) 
preferably arranged in uniform circumferential 

distribution. 
Handle according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that  
 

the cross-section of the core portion (6, 102) is profiled 
more or less in the shape of a gear or star. 
Handle according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
core portion consists of a harder plastic portion, in 

particular polycarbon. 
Handle according to one or more of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that the core portion (102) forms a dome 

(108) covering the end (104') of the cavity (104). 
Handle according to claim 1 or 3, characterised in that 
the core portion forms at least one, in particular two or 

four, radial predetermined breaking points (110) preferably 
arranged in uniform circumferential distribution. 
Handle according to one or more of the preceding claims 
2 to 6, characterised in that the predetermined breaking 

points are formed as webs of material (110) arranged 
between the peripheral surface (102') and the inner surface 

of the cavity. 
Handle according to one or more of the preceding claims 
2, 3, 4, 5 or 7, characterised in that the casing (101) 

made of an elastic, in particular compressible plastic, in 
particular PE or PP or a foam plastic, comprises a 

surrounding injection-moulded sheath (112) of harder 
plastic material. 
Handle according to one or more of the preceding claims 
1, 3, 6 or 7, characterised in that the softer one of the 

zones of plastics with different hardness penetrating each 
other, of which the harder one is non-deformable by the 

forces occurring due to operational loading, allows minor 
elastic deformation however, and the core portion (6) is 

surrounded by an injection-moulded casing (7) of more or 
less constant wall thickness made of harder plastic,  

 
wherein the recesses (8) resulting from profiling of the 

peripheral surface (11) are filled (filling 9) with a 
softer plastic until a more or less circular cross-sectional 

shape is obtained. 
Handle according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that individual areas (F) of the 

filled recesses (8), located one behind the other in the 
circumferential direction, are connected by a rib (24) of 

softer plastic material extending in the circumferential 
direction and filling a groove (23) of the casing (7). 
Handle according to claim 10, characterised in that the 
groove (23) in its depth extends as far as the core portion 

(6). 
Handle according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the core portion (6) is made 

of porously injection-moulded recycled material.
