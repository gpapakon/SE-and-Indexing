<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a reactor for application in a 
transport or distribution network for electrical energy and 

comprising at least one winding arranged in a metal housing, 
wherein means are arranged for applying an axial pressure 

force to the winding, wherein the metal housing forms part 
of the pressure means. 
This renders superfluous the use of extra constructions 
for applying an axial pressure force to the reactor. This 

avoids the problems associated with such constructions, 
while the possibility is likewise created of giving the 

reactor a smaller, lighter and less expensive form. 
According to a preferred embodiment a magnetic circuit 
is arranged inside the housing to screen the stray field 

generated by the winding, wherein at least a part of the 
magnetic circuit functions as means for transmitting from 

the housing the axial pressure force to be applied to the 
winding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reactor for application in a 
transport or distribution network for electrical energy and 
comprising at least one winding arranged in a metal housing, 
wherein means are arranged for applying an axial pressure 
force to the winding. Such reactors are generally known. Such reactors, also known as choke coils, serve to 
compensate reactive power that is generated in such a 
distribution network due to an excess of capacitive loads. The windings of such reactors forming part of the prior 
art generate inter alia axial forces during use which press 
together the individual turns of the winding. In order to 
prevent the turns hereby being set into movement and 
possibly being damaged, it must be ensured at all times that 
the turns are situated against each other, both during 
operation and when inoperative. A typical method of 
achieving this object is to apply an axial pressure force on 
the winding. In the reactor constructions of the prior art 
constructions are arranged for this purpose in the form of 
tie rods and the like which are generally arranged on the 
outside of the winding. Such tie rods otherwise find 
application in transformers as well. It will be apparent 
that such constructions result in an increase of the cost 
price of such a reactor and also in an increase in the mass 
of such a coil. The magnetic fields generated by the winding 
can moreover cause eddy currents and hysteresis losses in 
such a construction, whereby generation of heat takes place 
and the coil will absorb active power, which is of course 
not desirable. The object of the present invention is to provide such 
a reactor, wherein the above stated drawbacks are avoided. This object is achieved in that the metal housing forms 
part of the pressure means. This renders superfluous the use of extra constructions 
for applying an axial pressure force on the winding. This  
 
avoids the problems associated with such constructions, 
while the possibility is likewise created of giving the 
reactor a smaller, lighter and less expensive form. According to a preferred embodiment a magnetic circuit 
is arranged inside the housing to shield the stray field 
generated by the winding, wherein at least a part of the 
magnetic circuit functions as means for transmitting from 
the housing the axial pressure force to be applied to the 
winding. This preferred embodiment results in an additional 
saving of material and weight; the relevant part of the 
magnetic circuit fulfills a dual function. The present
