<ABSTRACT>
A process for the neutralisation of an acid stream by (a) feeding the acid stream and calcium hydroxide through a first reaction zone, preferably a plug flow reactor (1) to a second reaction zone, preferably a stirred tank reactor (12) so that the calcium hydroxide partially neutralises the acid stream during feed of the stream to the second reaction zone, the second reaction zone being provided with means for measuring the pH of the solution within the second reaction zone (14) and means for feeding aqueous base to the second reaction zone. The apparatus comprises a plug flow reactor (1) provided with means for feeding the acid stream (4) and calcium hydroxide stream (8) thereto under ratio feed-forward control (7), and a stirred tank reactor (12) provided with means for measuring the pH of the solution therein (14), an aqueous base feed (15) and feedback control means (17) for controlling the addition of aqueous base thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR NEUTRALISATION OF ACID STREAMS.This invention relates to a process for the neutralisation of aqueous acid streams with calcium hydroxide, and in particular to a process of neutralising a hydrochloric acid stream with calcium hydroxide. The invention relates in a further aspect to an apparatus in which the process of the invention may be effected.Hydrochloric acid is produced on a wide scale around the world, indeed it is produced as a by-product in very many industrial processes. In particular it is produced as a by-product in the reaction of chlorine containing compounds with hydrogen fluoride in which fluorine is exchanged for chlorine, many of which are practised around the world.Although hydrochloric acid may be a commercial product in itself, it is not practical to store large quantities for lengthy periods of time and consequently, if an immediate demand cannot be found, then it is necessary to dispose of the hydrochloric acid. Disposal of the acid involves first neutralising the acid stream followed by discharge of the neutralised effluent.In the past, the neutralisation of such acid streams has posed less of a problem than recently due to the rather less stringent environmental controls on the pH of the effluent discharge that have prevailed hitherto. However, the pH control requirements on the discharge of such neutralised acid streams are becoming increasingly stringent and pose particular problems for the control of pH during the neutralisation of the acid streams. 

 Acid streams are typically neutralised with a basic reagent containing sodium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide. Each of these reagents offers certain advantages and disadvantages. Thus, whilst sodium hydroxide is convenient to use due to its high solubility in water which allows it to be employed in the form of an aqueous solution, it is significantly more expensive than calcium hydroxide and poses problems of both pH measurement, due to the presence of sodium ions which have a deleterious effect on the operation of pH meters, and control, due to the characteristic titration curve which shows a very sharp change in pH over a very small change in sodium hydroxide addition in the neutral region. On the other hand, whilst being cheap, the use of calcium (hydr)oxide has posed various problems associated with the low degree of solubility of calcium hydroxide in water such that calcium hydroxide is predominantly present in solid form when added to the acid stream. In particular it poses control problems in
