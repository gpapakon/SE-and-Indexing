(18) of the terminals (5, 6, 7, 8) are exposed through 

an end (19) of the package (3) and also through an 
adjacent side (20) of the package (3). The end (19) and 

the side (20) of the package (3) are recessed to receive 
a mating electrical connector (24) to mate respective 

contacts (28) of the mating connector with the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector
for a battery, and more particularly, to an electrical
connector which is suitable for connecting a
rechargeable battery to a circuit board of electronic
equipment.Batteries used to power portable electronic
equipment for consumer and business use, such as, video
cameras, cellular telephones and computers are
considerable weight, for example 30 percent of the
weight of the equipment itself in the case of computers.
To reduce the weight and the size of such a battery
would, however, result in more frequent battery
replacement, or more frequent recharging of a spent
battery. Consequently a new generation of smaller,
lighter batteries is being developed, which have
charging circuits inside the batteries themselves. The
charging circuits are electronically controlled to
charge quickly, and to shut off when full charge is
approached. A connector for a rechargeable battery
would need to provide electrical connections for
discharging the battery, and separate electrical
connections for a charging control circuit within the
battery.The invention is intended to provide a connector
which includes battery terminals and a package
containing the terminals and further containing the
battery, electrical connections for the battery and a
charging control circuit.The present invention consists in an electrical
connector assembly as defined in claim 1. Embodiments of the
invention are defined in the subordinate claims.

connector for a rechargeable battery together with a
