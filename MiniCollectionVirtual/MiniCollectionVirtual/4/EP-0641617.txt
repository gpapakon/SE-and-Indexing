<ABSTRACT>
A milling cutter body of basically cylindrical shape 
has a plurality of grooves (3) of a circular cross-section 

which overlaps with the envelope surface of the 
cutter body, these grooves being intended for the 

insertion of insert-carrying cartridges (4) of a 
corresponding circular cross-section. The grooves (3) 

and thereby also the cartridges are not parallel to the 
axis of rotation of the cutter body but inclined to it. 

Thereby, a very precise positioning of the parallel 
land angle of the cutting edges is obtained by turning 

the cartridge around its own axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a milling
cutter body for chip-breaking machining.A typical milling tool comprises a milling
cutter body which is fastenable at the end of a
rotating shaft in a predetermined relation to its
rotational axis, and a plurality of cutting edges being
carried by the milling cutter body at a radial distance
from the rotational axis on the side of the cutter body
which is distanced from the shaft, so that the cutting
edges describe a circle around the central rotational
axis of the shaft when the cutter body is rotated by
the shaft. All parts of the milling cutter body are
axially and radially behind the cutting edges, so that
these may unobstructedly come into contact with and
machine the surface of a workpiece that is held by the
machine in which the shaft rotates. Since the cutting
edges are short, they perform a relatively narrow
cutting, wherefore the tool is used with a transversal
feed, i.e., the direction of feed is parallel to the
machined surface of the workpiece.In relation with milling cutters with
mechanically fastened cutting inserts, it has turned
out to be difficult to fasten the inserts with the
required precision for obtaining a fine smooth surface
on the workpiece and a long tool-life. In order to 
attain the required surface smoothness it is necessary
that the cutting edges attain a possibly exact
position, both radially and axially. Moreover, an exact
positioning of the so called parallel land angle is
very important for the fineness and smoothness of the
produced surface. The "parallel land angle" is the
angle between the operative cutting edge and the
produced surface. This angle shall be as small as
possible, with other words it should preferably be 0.
However, it has prooved to be very difficult to attain
this, in particular having regard to the fact that all
cutting edges of the cutter body shall have this
minimized parallel land angle.US-A-2 972 802 discloses a milling cutter according to the
preamble of claim 1. This known milling cutter is provided with
adjustable radial rake, in which the inserted
cartridges are inclined relative to the rotational axis
of the cutter body. The cartridges and the recesses in
the milling cutter are provided with cooperating
serrations. An adjustment of the rake can not be made
smaller than the width of one serration, which is not
satisfactory in a modern precision tool. Thus, a first object of the present invention
is to provide a milling cutter body comprising cutting
edges, whose parallel land angles can be finely
ad

<CLAIMS>
Milling cutter body of basically cylindrical form
comprising an upper side, a lower side and an envelope

surface, a plurality of grooves (3) being arranged in
the envelope surface, which grooves (3) have a

basically circular cross-section, for the accomodation
of insert-carrying cartridges (4) of a corresponding

circular cross-section, the grooves (3) and thereby
also the inserted cartridges (4) not being parallel to

the central or rotational axis of the cutter body, but
are inclined to said axis, 
characterized in that
 the
positioning of the insert-carrying cartridge is

effected by two eccentric taps, of which the one (12)
is intended for the axial positioning of the cartridge

and the other one (10) is arranged to rotate the
cartridge (4) around its own central axis, in that the

two taps (10, 12) are inserted in holes in the grooves,
and in that the cartridge comprises a hole (15) against

the upper and lower parts of which the one eccentric
tap acts so as to effect the axial positioning, and a

recess (11) against the walls of which the other tap
(10) acts so as to rotate the cartridge (4) around its

own central axis.
Cutter body according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the angle between
the central axes of the grooves and the central axis of 

the cutter body is between 1 and 15°, preferably
between 2 and 10°.
Cutter body according to claim 2,
characterized
 in that said angle is
between 3 and 8°.
Cutter body according any of claims 1 to 3,
characterized
 in that said grooves (3) are
through from the upper side to the lower side.
Cutter body according to any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that one or more
fastening screws (17,18) are arranged for fastening the

cartridge (4) after the desired axial and angular
positions having been attained.
Cutter body according to any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that a washer
means (19) is provided between the heads of the

fastening screws (17,18) and the cartridge (4), the
side of said washer means facing the central axis of

the cutter body being rounded and supporting against a
correspondingly rounded surface in a cavity in the

cartridge (4).
