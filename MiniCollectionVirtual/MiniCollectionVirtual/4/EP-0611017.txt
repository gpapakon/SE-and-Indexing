<ABSTRACT>
In a forage harvester having a motor driven sharpening 
means (15) driven back and forth along a path parallel to the 

axis of a rotating cutterhead (9) to sharpen the knives (10) of 
the cutterhead (9), and a door (50) which normally prevents 

access to the knives (10), a control circuit is provided for 
controlling the opening of the door (50), the movement of the 

sharpening means (15) to sharpen the knives (10), and the 
closing of the door (50) after the knives (10) have been 

sharpened. The circuit is controlled by switches located at an 
operator's control panel and accessible to the operator while 

he is in the driver's seat of the harvester so that the 
operator does not have to leave his driving position to 

accomplish the knife sharpening operation. The circuit may 
include visual indicators located on the control panel for 

indicating the status of the circuit during the entire 
operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel method and apparatus for
automatically controlling the sharpening of cutterhead knives
in a forage harvester. The invention provides improvements in
cutterhead knife sharpening systems of the type disclosed in
US-A-4.834.303, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein
by reference.In US-A-4.834.303 we disclose a knife sharpening apparatus
for sharpening the cutterhead knives in a forage harvester. The
apparatus disclosed therein includes a sharpening stone that is
driven back and forth adjacent a rotating cutterhead to sharpen
the knives thereof, the knives traversing a path which defines
a cylinder. A control circuit is provided so that an operator
may control the sharpening operation by operating switches in
the cab of the forage harvester. However, as disclosed in the
patent, the operator must first get out of the cab and manually
turn a crank to open an access door, then return to the cab to
initiate and control the knife sharpening operation and, after
the sharpening operation is completed, again get out of the cab
to close the access door. In the patent we suggest that the
access door may be driven by a motor controlled from the
operator's cab, but we disclose no circuitry for interlocking
the door operations with the knife sharpening operations, an
essential consideration since the sharpening stone traverses a
path such that it would collide with the door if the door is
not open.In US-A-4.503.643 a sharpener assembly is shown in which
an access door is mechanically coupled to the pivot mechanism
of the sharpening stone in a manner such that the door is
caused to close when the stone is retracted from the cutterhead
of the harvester and, conversely, is opened as the stone is
lowered to perform a sharpening operation. Since the stone and
the access door always move simultaneously, the danger of 
collision between both parts is avoided. However, due to the
fact that the access door and sharpening stone are not moveable
independently, the access opening on top of the cutterhead is
always obstructed by either the door or the stone or a
combination of both, meaning that said opening cannot be
employed for eventual inspection or servicing of the
cutterhead.The knife sharpening system disclosed in the
aforementioned patent US-A-4.834.303 is further operable
regardless of the rate of rotation of the cutterhead knives.
Since the sharpening stone is controlled to sharpen the knives
for a fixed interval of time, incomplete sharpening may occur
if the cutterhead is
