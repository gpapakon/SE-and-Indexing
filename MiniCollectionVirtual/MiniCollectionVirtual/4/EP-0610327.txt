<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable keyboard holder (20) that is infinitely adjustable both angularly and vertically. The keyboard holder (20) includes a locking apparatus (112) that allows ease of adjustment as well as restraining the keyboard holder (20) from movement when locked. This keyboard holder (20) allows adjustment without interfering with the use of an underdesk visual display terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ADJUSTABLE KEYBOARD HOLDER FOR COMPUTER WORKSTATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention; This invention relates to the field of adjustable keyboard holders, particularly for keyboard holders for computer workstations.2. Statement of the Problem: Persons working with keyboards, such as for computer systems, often are limited in positions available for using the keyboards. At best, the keyboards are adjustable in only a few positions. Not only are these keyboards normally ergonomically inadequate, but keyboard operators are increasingly becoming inflicted with carpal tunnel syndrome from the use of such keyboards. Carpal tunnel syndrome, a debilitating injury which is becoming very prevalent, occurs from repetitive wrist motions. More and more governments are requiring that keyboards have the capacity for frequent changes in position to reduce the incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome.The American National Standard for Human Factors Engineering of Visual Display Terminal Workstations 

 set forth design considerations for furniture designers. These standards include specified ranges of height and adjustability of keyboard support surfaces. These ranges include that the angle between the upper arm and the forearm of the seated person using the keyboard be greater than seventy degrees and less than one hundred thirty five degrees. The keyboard support surface should also range in height above the floor from twenty-three inches to twenty- eight inches to accommodate various heights of keyboard users. Another consideration is that the adjustment controls be easily accessible and usable, to encourage their use. Studies have shown that by frequently changing the position of the keyboard, carpal tunnel syndrome can be avoided.There have been some prior art attempts to provide adjustable holders for keyboards. These typically have a ratchet-type mechanism to allow the holder to be adjusted through a few predetermined positions. Many of these keyboard holders include a center-post structure which prevents them from being usable on an underdesk CRT workstation or on a pop-up CRT workstation.Thus, a problem exists in providing a keyboard holder being infinitely adjustable and usable with visual display terminal workstation.3. Solution to the Problem; The present invention solves this problem and others by providing an easily adjustable keyboard holder. The keyboard holder of the present invention provides a keyboard holder that is infinitely adjustable within a range of motion.

<CLAIMS>
 WE CLAIM:
1. Akeyboardholder for adjustablypositioning a keyboard, said holder comprising: a keyboard support for supporting a keyboard; means on said keyboard support for infinitely positioning said keyboard support relative to a keyboard operator through a predetermined range of motion; and means for locking said keyboard support in a selected adjusted position.
2. The holder of claim 1 wherein said holder further comprises means for mounting said keyboard support to a workstation.
3. The holder of claim 1 wherein said keyboard support is slidably mounted on a workstation.
4. The holder of claim 1 wherein said holder further comprises means for slidably mounting said keyboard support to a workstation having an underdesk visual display terminal without interfering with said underdesk visual display terminal.
5. The holder of claim 1 wherein said means for infinite adjusting said keyboard support include: means for pivotally mounting said keyboard support to allow said keyboard support to be infinitely adjustable about said pivotal mounting means through said range of motion. 


 6. The holder of claim 5 wherein said locking means include: means for locking said keyboard support to prevent said keyboard support from pivoting on said pivotal mounting means; and for unlocking said keyboard support to allow said keyboard support to freely pivot about said pivotal mounting means.
7. The holder of claim 6 wherein said locking means include: means for providing frictional pressure on said pivotal mounting means when said keyboard support is in said locked position, and said frictional pressure is removed when said keyboard support is in said unlocked position.
8. The holder of claim 7 wherein said locking means further include means for actuating said locked position and unlocked position; said actuating means include a first cam surface on said actuating means having a raised portion and a lowered portion; a second cam surface formed on said pivotal mounting means having a raised portion and a lowered position; and wherein said frictional pressure is removed when said raised portion of said first cam surface engages said raised portion of said second cam surface and said friction pressure is provided when said raised portion of said first cam surface engages said lowered portion of said second cam surface. 


 9. The holder of claim 8 wherein said actuating means include a lever affixed to said pivotal mounting means.
10. The holder of claim 6 wherein said frictional pressure means include compressible friction means for locking said keyboard support when said keyboard support are in said locked position.
