<ABSTRACT>
Described are electret fibres with improved charge stability (stabilisation) which consist of a material which predominantly contains a fibre-forming addition or condensation polymer and 0.01 to 30% by weight (preferably 0.01 to 10, in particular 0.1 to 5, % by weight), based on the weight of the material, of organic or organometallic charge control agents, as is contained in toners for electrophotographic processes, and a process for the production thereof. Also described are textile materials containing these electret fibres.
