<ABSTRACT>
New styles of hepatitis-C virus (HCV), referred to as HCV-3 and HCV-4, have been identified and sequenced. Antigenic regions of HCV-2, HCV-3 and HCV-4 polypeptides have been identified. Immunoassays for HCV and antibodies thereto are described, which allow more complete screening of blood samples for HCV, and allow HCV genotyping.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the discovery of new
types of hepatitis C virus, that we have termed type 3
(HCV-3) and type 4 (HCV-4). In particular, it relates to
the etiologic agent of hepatitis C virus type 3 and 4, and
to polynucleotides and immunoreactive polypeptides which
are useful in immunoassays for the detection of HCV-3 and
HCV-4 in biological samples; and also to the use of
antigenic HCV-3 and HCV-4 specific polypeptides in
vaccines.Acute viral hepatitis is a disease which may result
in chronic liver damage. It is clinically diagnosed by a
well-defined set of patient symptoms, including jaundice,
hepatic tenderness, and an increase in the serum levels of
alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase.
Serologic immunoassays are generally performed to diagnose
the specific type of viral causative agent.
Historically, patients presenting with symptoms of
hepatitis and not otherwise infected by hepatitis A,
hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr or cytomegalovirus were
clinically diagnosed as having non-A, non-B hepatitis
(NANBH) by default. For many years, the agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis
remained elusive. It has now been established that many
cases of NANBH are caused by a distinct virus termed
hepatitis C virus (HCV). European Patent Application
EP-A-0318216 discloses cDNA sequences derived from HCV,
polynucleotide probes and polypeptides for use in
immunoassays. Further information is provided in
European Application EP-A-0388232.The HCV genome encodes a large polyprotein precursor,
which contains structural and non-structural regions. The
single protein is apparently cleaved into a variety of
proteins after production. Most of the structural and
non-structural proteins have now been identified from in
vitro RNA translation and expression as recombinant
proteins. The C and E regions encode for nucleocapsid
structural proteins and for envelope structural proteins,
respectively. At least five additional regions follow,
which encode for non-structural (NS) protein of undefined
function. The organisation is believed to be as follows
(A. Alberti, Journal of Hepatology, 1991; 12; 279 to 282)

Certain immunoreactive proteins have been described as
recombinant proteins, for example C22 (in the core
region), C33 (in NS3 region), 5-1-1 and C100 (both in the
NS4 region), and NS5 (NS5 region). Diagnosis of
hepatitis C is still largely based on methods which detect
antibodies against the product of the C-100 clone. This 
clone was ligated with overlapping clones to produce a
larger viral antigen
