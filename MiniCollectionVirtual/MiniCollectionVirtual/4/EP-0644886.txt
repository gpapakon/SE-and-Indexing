<DESCRIPTION>
 3-SUBSTITUTED CAREIACEPHEMSThis invention relates to novel β-lactam compounds, their preparation and their use, and in particular to a novel class of cephems. These compounds have antibacterial properties, and are therefore of use in the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and animals caused by a wide range of organisms.PCT/GB91/01228 (WO 92/01696) generically discloses cephems of general formula (A):(A) wherein R*, R--, R^ and R^ are various substituents, m is 1 or 2 and X is S, SO, SO25 O or CH2-We have found a particularly advantageous class of carbacephems bearing a cyclic ether or thio-ether substituent at the 3-position of the cephem nucleus, and which are not specifically disclosed in WO92/01696.The present invention provides a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof:(I) wherein:R- is hydrogen, methoxy or formamido;R-- is an acyl group, in particular that of an antibacterially active cephalosporin; CO2R is a carboxy group or a carboxylate anion, or R3 is a readily removable carboxy protecting group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt-forming group or in vivo hydrolysable ester group;R represents hydrogen or up to four substituents, which may be present on any of the carbon atoms in the ring system shown, selected from alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen, amino, alkylamino, acylamino, dialkylamino, CO2R, CONR2> SO2NR2 where R is hydrogen or alkyl, aryl and heterocyclyl, which may be the same or different and wherein any R^ alkyl substituent is optionally substituted by one or 

more substituents selected from the list from which R^ is selected; Y is O, S, SO or SO2; and m is 1 or 2.The bonding carbon atom of the cyclic ether or thio-ether moiety which links the ring to the cephem nucleus is generally asymmetric. The present invention includes either stereoisomer, as well as mixtures of both isomers.In compounds of formula (I) wherein R* is for arnido, the formamido group can exist in conformations wherein the hydrogen atoms of the -NH-CHO moiety are cis- or trans-; of these the cis conformation normally predominates.Preferred compounds within formula (I) are compounds of formula (Ia) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or pharmaceutically acceptable in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof:(Ia) wherein R , R--, R4, and y are as defined with respect to formula (I) and the group CO2R is CO2R where CO2R^ is a carboxy group or a carboxylate anion.Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable
