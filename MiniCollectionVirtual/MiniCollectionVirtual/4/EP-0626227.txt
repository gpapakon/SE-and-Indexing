<ABSTRACT>
A submerged arc welding method for a high strength 
(2.25%-3%)Cr-3%Mo-V steel, to obtain a weld metal excellent 

in strength at room temperature and high temperature, 
toughness, and creep strength, after SR,
 temper brittleness 
resistance, cold crack resistance and SR crack resistance. 

The Cr-Mo steel contains: 2.00 to 3.25% of Cr, 0.90 to 1.20% 
of Mo, and V as essential components, and Nb, Ti, B and Ca 

as needed. A welding heat input is in the range of from 20 
to 50 kJ/cm. The solid wire contains 0.09 to 0.19% of C, 

0.30% or less of Si, 0.50 to 1.40% of Mn, 2.00 to 3.80% of 
Cr and 0.90 to 1.20% of Mo. The bonded flux contains 5 to 

20% of SiO₂, 20 to 40% of MgO, 2.4 to 12% of a metal 
fluoride (F-converted value) and 3 to 12% of a metal 

carbonate (CO₂-converted value). A weld metal contains 0.08 
to 0.15% of C, 0.05 to 0.30% of Si, 0.50 to 1.20% of Mn, 

0.030 to 0.060% of O, 0.10 to 0.50% of V and 0.005 to 0.035% 
of Nb. P and Ti in the weld metal are restricted to 0.010% 

or less and 0.012% or less, respectively. The components of 
C, Si, Mn, O, P, Ti are added from the solid wire and the 

bonded flux, and the components of V and Nb are added from 
at least one of the wire and the bonded flux. Moreover, the 

welding is performed such that Ps is 3.50 to 5.50, Ps being 
expressed by 


Ps = 10×[C]

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a welding method for 
high strength Cr-Mo steels, and particularly to a submerged 
arc welding method for high strength 
(2.25%-3%)Cr-1%Mo-steels containing Cr, Mo and V as 
essential components, and further Nb, Ti, B, Ca and the like 
as needed, to obtain weld metals excellent in strength at 
room temperature and high temperature, toughness, and creep 
strength, after stress relief (SR), temper brittleness 
resistance (less brittleness in service under high 
temperature environments), cold crack resistance 
(difficult-to-generate delayed fracture due to hydrogen) and 
SR crack resistance (difficult-to-generate intergranular 
crack due to age-hardening precipitation). Conventionally, (2.25%-3%)Cr-1%Mo-Steels have been 
extensively used for structures operated under high 
temperature/high pressure environments such as boilers and 
pressure vessels because of excellent high temperature 
characteristics. These structures being large in size and 
wall thicknesses have been mostly welded by a submerged arc 
welding method with a high welding efficiency. In recent 
years, to achieve the high efficient operation for the 
equipment, there is a tendency to enlarge the size and wall 
thickness of structures and to increase the temperature and 
pressure of the service environment. To meet the requirement, 
research activities have been made to develop high 
strength Cr-Mo steels added with V, Nb and the like. Similarly, there have been strong demands in welding 
materials toward further improved performances in terms of 
high temperature strength, toughness, creep strength, temper 
brittleness resistance, cold crack resistance and SR crack 
resistance. To obtain weld metals having the 
above-described performances, various submerged arc welding  
 
methods have been disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent 
Publication Nos. SHO 61-71196, SHO 61-232089, SHO 63-238978,

4-253595, and Examined Japanese Patent Publication No. HEI 
4-79752.  
 In particular, document JP-A-2-182378 discloses a submerged 
arc welding method for a high strength Cr-Mo 
steel using a solid wire combined with a bonded flux, 
wherein said Cr-Mo steel contains 1.85 to 3.25% of Cr, 
0.85 to 1.15% of Mo, and V as essential components, 
a welding heat input is in the range of from 20 to 50 
kJ/cm, 
said solid wire contains 0.07 to 0.15% of C, 0.30% or 
less of Si, 0.50 to 1.0% of Mn, 2.25 to 3.25% of Cr and 
0.85 to 1.15% of Mo, V and Nb,
