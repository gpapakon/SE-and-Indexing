<ABSTRACT>
Described herein ia low volume photographic 
material processing apparatus which utilizes a narrow 

horizontal processing channel (25) which is formed by 
a repeating combination of transport roller units (12, 

13, 15) and impingement slot nozzles. Photographic 
processing solution is introduced into opposite ends 

of alternating impingement slot nozzles and the roller 
units (12, 13, 15) are used to remove processing 

solution from the photosensitive material (21) and 
provide transport therefor. The slot nozzles and the 

roller units (12, 13, 15) work interactively to break 
down the chemical barrier layer over the surface of 

the photosensitive material (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to automatic
processors for processing photosensitive material, and
is more particularly concerned with counter cross flow
in such processors.The processing of photosensitive material
involves a series of steps such as developing,
bleaching, fixing, washing, and drying. With the
development step being the most critical and sensitive
to variations induced by time, temperature, agitation
and chemical activity. These steps lend themselves to
mechanization by conveying a continuous web of film or
cut sheets of film or photographic paper sequentially
through a series of stations or tanks, each one
containing a different processing liquid appropriate
to the process step at that station.There are various sizes of photographic film
processing apparatus, i.e., large photofinishing
apparatus and microlabs. A large photofinishing
apparatus utilizes tanks which contain approximately
100 liters of each processing solution. A small
photofinishing apparatus or microlab utilizes tanks
which may contain less than 10 liters of processing
solution.The chemicals contained in the processing
solution: cost money to purchase; change in activity
and are seasoned by the constituents of the
photosensitive materials which leach out during the
photographic process; and after the chemicals are used
the chemicals must be disposed of in an
environmentally safe manner. Thus, it is important in
all sizes of photofinishing apparatus to reduce the
volume of processing solution. The prior art suggests 
various types of replenishing systems which add or
subtract specific chemicals to the processing solution
to maintain a consistency of photographic
characteristics in the material developed. It is
possible to maintain reasonable consistency of
photographic characteristics only for a certain period
of replenishment. After a processing solution has
been used a given number of times, the solution is
discarded and a new processing solution is added to
the tank.Activity degradation due to instability of
the chemistry, or chemical contamination, after the
components of the processing solution are mixed
together causes one to discard the processing solution
in smaller volume tanks more frequently than larger
volume tanks. Some of the steps in the photographic
process utilize processing solutions which contain
chemicals that are unstable, i.e., they have a short
process life. Thus, processing solutions in tanks
which contain unstable chemicals are discarded more
frequently than processing solutions in tanks which
contain
