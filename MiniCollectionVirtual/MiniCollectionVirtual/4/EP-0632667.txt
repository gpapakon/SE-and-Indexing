unnecessary trunk lines in a private branch exchange 

telephone system including a plurality of switching nodes, 
each having a unique node identification number where each 

pair of nodes is connected by a plurality of trunk lines, 
includes steps for (a) compiling a telephone call 

identifier list containing node identification numbers and 
an associated trunk call identification number used in 

defining and connecting a call path between a calling 
party and a called party, (b) examining a call identifier 

list at each of the switching nodes for information 
indicative of redundant node identification numbers, and 

(c) releasing the unnecessary trunk lines between the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods 
releasing unneeded or unnecessary trunk lines from a 
telephone call. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to a method for releasing unnecessary trunk lines 
between private branch exchange system switching nodes 
when a call path is routed through the same switching node 
twice. A private network is set up for the exclusive 
use of a single user, e.g., a company or association. One 
common form of private network is the private branch 
exchange (PBX) or the private automated branch exchange 
(PABX), hereinafter PABX, which is a switching office used 
by organizations with a large need for internal 
communications. A PABX is commonly connected to at least 
one switching office of a public telephone network. One 
PABX may also be connected by tie trunks, i.e., trunk 
lines, to other PABXs belonging to the same user to create 
a PABX network, whore each PABX constitutes a switching 
node of the switching network, As a result of call routing, call forwarding, 
call transfer, or conducting a conference call across the 
PABX network using multiple switching nodes, a call may 
become connected over more trunks lines than are necessary 
to complete that call. It will be immediately appreciated  
 
that releasing all unnecessary trunk lines will reduce the 
cost of providing the voice path for the individual call, 
it will also be noted that reducing the total number of 
trunk lines required by the PABX network to provide 
adequate service to all customers will result in lower 
costs to the network owner. Typically, PABX networks can be classified as 
employing centralized control or distributed control. It 
will be appreciated that PABX networks using centralized 
network control, e.g., a centralized private network 
controller such as Signalling System 7, avoid unnecessary 
trunk line usage through automatic B Channel conservation 
features. Centralized network control systems provide a 
wide variety of routing and switching of network call 
traffic with a view towards maximizing network utilization 
while minimizing call blocking. For example, in the 
specification of U.S. Patent No. 5,142,570 is disclosed a 
method for generating a set of routing paths from 
information including occupancy values. The routing 
method combines both modified state dependent routing and 
sequential routing techniques. This patent specification 
discloses the relevance of the specification of U.S. 
Patent No. 4,788,721. The specification of U.S. Patent No. 5,101,451
