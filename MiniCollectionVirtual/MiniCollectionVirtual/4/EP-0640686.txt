<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for stabilizing 
glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and a clinical assay 
reagent composition containing stabilized glucose 6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is an enzyme 
catalyzing a reaction of, in the presence of a coenzyme 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (hereinafter referred to 
simply as NAD) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
(hereinafter referred to simply as NADP), oxidizing glucose 
6-phosphate into glucono-δ-lactone 6-phosphate and reduced 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (hereinafter referred to 
simply as NADH) or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (hereinafter referred to simply as NADPH) or vice 
versa. This enzyme is widely distributed in the natural 
world. Although glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase has been 
used in determining glucose-related substances and coenzymes 
or measuring the activities of glucose-related enzymes in 
clinical specimens using this function, it lacks stability 
for practical applications. Various procedures have been described to improve the 
stability of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase such as using 
an enzyme originating in a thermophilic bacterium (see JP-A-56-169598  
 
corresponding to U.S Patent No. 4,438,199 and JP-A-59-151899 
corresponding to EP-A-119 722, the term "JP-A" as 
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application"). Satisfactory stability is not reliably 
achieved by these methods. It has also suggested to stabilize glucose 6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase with a chelating agent or an SH 
compound in a reagent for assaying glucose (see EP-A-253 
520), however satisfactory stability is not achieved in a 
weakly acidic region. It is an object of the present invention to stabilize 
glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a liquid clinical assay 
reagent, which is used for quantitatively determining the 
amount of a glucose-related substance or coenzyme or 
measuring the activity of a glucose-related enzyme. The present invention provides a method for 
stabilizing glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase by adding to 
glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase at least one stabilizer 
selected from among hydroxylamines, aldehyde scavengers and 
their salts. The hydroxylamine used in the present invention is a 
compound represented by formula (I) [hereinafter referred to 
simply as the compound (I)]:  where R¹, R² and R³ may be either the same or different and 
each represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or 
unsubstituted lower alkyl group, a
