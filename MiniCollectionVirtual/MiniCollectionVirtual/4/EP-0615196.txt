<ABSTRACT>
Device for communication between at least one client and at least one server who are exchanging messages, characterised in that it includes a router which switches the messages between at least one client and at least one server with the aid of three message queues,   . a first queue allocated to the router providing for the storage of the messages from the clients or servers; . a second queue allocated to the server allowing the reading of the messages for requests formulated at the server; . a third queue allocated to the client allowing the reading of the response messages.

<CLAIMS>
Communication device between at least one client and at
least one server which exchange messages, characterised

in that it comprises a router (360) that routes the
messages between at least one client (361, 2) and at

least one server (381, 382, 25) using three categories
of message queues,


a queue (3601) allocated to the router (360) that
stores the messages from clients or servers;
a queue (381) allocated to each server, allowing
the request messages addressed to the server (38,

35) to be read;
a queue (392) allocated to each client (39)
allowing the answer messages to be read.
Device according to claim 1 characterised in that the
client (39) generates a message identifier for the

router.
Device according to claim 1 or 2 characterised in that
the router (360) generates a message identifier for the

server (38, 35) and the client (39).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised
in that the server (38, 35) generates a message

identifier for the router (360).
Device according to claim 1 or 4 characterised in that
the message comprises a two-byte field indicating

whether the communication is synchronous or
asynchronous and a two-byte field for indicating

whether the message is an answer or a request and
giving this field respectively the value zero or a

value different from zero.
Device according to claim 5 characterised in that the 
message comprises a four-byte field identifying the

user that has sent the message.
Device according to claim 5 characterised in that the
message comprises a four-byte field identifying the

addressee of the message.
Method for processing synchronous requests between at
least one client and at least one server conducting a

dialogue across a routing device according to one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that it

comprises the following steps;

the client (39) sends a request message to the
queue (3601) of the router;
the router (360) sends to the queue (351, 381) of
the server (35, 38) a message with an identifier;
after receiving the answer in its queue, the
router (360) sends an acknowledgment message to

the client (39) with an identifier allowing it to
find the answer in the queue (3601) of the router

(360).
Method according to claim 8 characterised in that the
client (39) is itself a server.
Method according to claim 8 characterised in that the
server is a client of another server in a synchronous

or asynchronous method.
Method of processing asynchronous requests between at
least one client and one server conducting a dialogue

across a routing device according to one of claims 1 to
7, characterised in that it comprises the following

steps;

the client (39) sends a request message to the
queue (3601) of the router with a first

identifier; 
the router (360) sends to the queue (351, 381) of
the server (35, 38) a message with a second

identifier, acknowledges receipt to the client
(39) of the request message and the server (35,

38) acknowledges receipt to the router (360) by
sending to the queue (3601) of the router (360)

the second identifier;
the server sends to the queue (3601) of the router
a message with the second identifier when it has

prepared the answer.
Method according to claim 11 characterised in that when
the server (38, 35) has sent an identifier and the

answer message to the queue (3601) of the router (360),
the router sends the message to the queue (351) of the

message box server (35), which acknowledges the router
(360), which acknowledges the server (381).
Method according to claim 11 or 12 characterised in
that the client retrieves the answer by sending a

request message (fetch-message) to the queue (3601) of
the router, which transmits this message to the queue

of the server (35) of the message box, the server (35)
of the message box sending the answer to the queue of

the router, which retransmits the message to the
client.
Method according to one of claims 11 to 13
characterised in that the client (39) sends a request

message to the queue (3601) of the router (360), the
latter compares the value of the message identifier

with the value "-1", either to calculate a new message
identifier to be used in the other stages if the value

is "-1", or to retransmit the identifier received if
the value is different from "-1".
Method according to claim 8, 11 or 14 characterised in 

that the message comprises a two-byte field indicating
whether the communication is synchronous or

asynchronous and a two-byte field for indicating
whether the message is an answer or a request.
Method according to claim 15 characterised in that the
message comprises a four-byte field for identifying the

message sender.
Method according to claim 15 characterised in that the
message comprises a four-byte field identifying the

message addressee.
