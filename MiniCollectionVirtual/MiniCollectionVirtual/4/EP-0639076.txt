<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF GUANYLATE CYCLASE INHIBITORS IN THE TREATMENT OF SHOCKBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField Of The InventionThe invention relates to a new method for the treatment of shock states, such as septic shock, cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock, shock caused by blood flow obstruction, neuropathic shock, and hypotensive disorders, comprising administering a pharmaceutical composition containing a guanylate cyclase inhibitor to a patient. 0Brief Description Of The Background ArtShock is a clinical emergency, characterized by widespread, serious reduction in tissue perfusion which, if prolonged, leads to generalized 15 impairment of cellular function. Shock is usually associated with systemic hypotension resulting from a significant decrease in either cardiac output <* or systemic vascular resistance, without a compensatory increase in the other. '* Shock states are classified according to the precipitating factors.20 Examples include septic (bacteremia), cardiogenic (heart pump failure), hypovolemic (fluid loss), obstructive (circulatory obstruction), and neuropathic (drugs or spinal cord injury). 

 9 -Septic shock, a life-threatening complication of bacteremia affects 150,000 to 300,000 patients annually in the United States, and has a mortality rate of 50% to 75% (Kilbourn et al, Biochem. and Biophys. Res. Comm. iZ2(3):1132-1138 (1990); Petros et al, The Lancet 338:1557-1558 (1991)). The shock state is characterized by circulatory insufficiency due to diffuse cell and tissue injury and the pooling of blood in the microcirculation.The pathogenesis of the cardiovascular collapse that occurs during septic shock is poorly understood, but is believed to occur as a result of the reaction between bacterial products and components of the coagulation and complement systems. For example, bacterial endotoxin activates the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins, cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and platelet activating factor. These inflammatoiy mediators significantly affect vasomotor tone, microvascular permeability and leukocyte and platelet aggregation.In addition, endotoxin activates the alternative complement pathway, resulting in generation of C3a and C5a, which in turn affect platelet aggregation and vascular tone. Activation of the coagulation system by bacterial products further alters the microcirculation in tissues by contributing to thrombi formation. Finally, endotoxin stimulates release of vasoactive substance such as catecholamines,
