<ABSTRACT>
A photographic printing apparatus (1) includes a 
reading device (RD) for reading 

image information from a film (2), and an exposure 
condition computing device for 

computing exposure conditions for exposing a photosensitive material based on 
the image information read by the reading device. The apparatus further includes 

an image information converter (103) for converting the 
image information read by 

the reading device into image information expected 
to appear on the photosensitive 

material when the photosensitive material is exposed to the image information 
on the film under the exposure conditions computed by the exposure condition 

computing device (102). The image information 
converted by the image information 

converter is displayed on a monitor (MT). The exposure 
condition computing device (102) 

receives instructions through a control panel (o) to 
correct the exposure conditions 

for the image information displayed on the monitor, or instructions not to correct 
the exposure conditions. An exposure device exposes the photosensitive material 

under exposure condition computed by the exposure condition computing device 
based on correcting instructions inputted through the control panel. The exposure 

device is operable in parallel with an input from the control panel to the exposure 
condition computing device, to exposure the photosensitive material to image 

information for which the exposure conditions have been corrected based on the 

correcting instructions from the control panel or for which non-correction 
instructions have been received.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic printing apparatus. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a photographic printing apparatus having a 
reading device for reading image information from a film, an exposure condition 
computing device for computing exposure conditions for exposing a 
photosensitive material based on the image information read by the reading 
device, an image information converting device for converting the image 
information read by the reading device into image information expected to 
appear on the photosensitive material when the photosensitive material is exposed 
to the image information on the film under the exposure conditions computed 
by the exposure condition computing device, a monitor for displaying the image 
information converted by the image information converting device, a correcting 
instruction input device for inputting to the exposure condition computing device 
instructions to correct the exposure conditions for the image information displayed 
on the monitor or instructions not to correct the exposure conditions, and an 
exposure device for exposing the photosensitive material under exposure condition 
computed by the exposure condition computing device based on the correcting 
instructions from the correcting instruction input device. This photographic printing apparatus reads image information from a film, 
and computes exposure conditions from the image information read, for exposing 
a photosensitive material. It is possible to display so-called simulated image 
information on the monitor, which corresponds to image information expected 
to appear on the photosensitive material when the photosensitive material is  
 
exposed under the exposure conditions computed. The operator of this photographic printing apparatus observes the image 
information displayed on the monitor, and determines whether the exposure 
conditions computed by the exposure condition computing device are satisfactory. 
If these exposure conditions are satisfactory, the operator inputs instructions 
through the correcting instruction input device, indicating that the exposure 
conditions need not be corrected. If the exposure conditions require correction, 
the operator inputs appropriate correcting instructions through the correcting 
instruction input device. Upon receipt of the correcting instructions from the correcting instruction 
input device, the exposure condition computing device carries out a correcting 
computation to obtain new exposure conditions. The exposure

A photographic printing apparatus comprising: 

read means (RD) for reading image information for each film frame of a roll 
of film; 
memory means (101) for storing a plurality of frame image information read 
by the read means; 
exposure condition computing means (T) for computing exposure conditions 
for exposing a photosensitive material based on the image information read 

from the memory means; 
exposure means (S) for exposing said photosensitive material based on the 
exposure conditions; 
image information converting means (U) for converting the image information 
read from the memory means into simulated image information based 

on the computed exposure conditions; 
a monitor (MT) for displaying the simulated image information for each film frame; and 
a control panel (O) for providing said exposure condition computing means 
with a command indicating necessity of correcting the exposure conditions 

of the film frame which corresponds to the simulated image information 
on said monitor;
charactererized in that
 said exposure means (S) is arranged to effecting printing on said 
photographic sensitive material of the film frames, one after another, based on the 

corrected exposure conditions input by an operator via said control panel 
(O) while said monitor simultaneously introduces and displays image information of further film 

frames to be printed and while the control panel also simultaneously allows correction commands 
concerning these further film frames to be input by an operator so that while 

the operator determines whether the exposure conditions for there further film frames are 
satisfactory or not, the exposure device effects exposure of the photosensitive material to film 

frames which exposure conditions the operator has already determined acceptable. 
A photographic printing apparatus as defined in claim 1,
characterized in that
 said exposure means (S) effects printing for the 
film frames whose simulated image information has moved out 

from said monitor (MT) so as to disappear from said monitor.  
 
A photographic printing apparatus as defined in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 said control panel (O) is capable of designation the 
number of prints for a film image frame corresponding to a simulated 

image information displayed on said monitor (MT). 
A photographic printing apparatus as defined in claim 3,
characterized in that
 said monitor (MT) displays a plurality of the 
simulated image information for a series of film frames, wherein said 

commands and said number of prints are provided for each one of said simulated 
film information selected.
