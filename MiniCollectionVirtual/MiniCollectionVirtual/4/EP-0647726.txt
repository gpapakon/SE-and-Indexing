<ABSTRACT>
In a process for treating parts, esp. steel and/or cast iron parts, the parts are subjected to combined oxidn. (blueing) and hardening by introduction or injection of a reducing and oxidising reaction gas at the hardening temp. into the treatment furnace. Pref. the reaction gas is produced using a methanol-water mixt.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the treatment of parts, in particular
steel and/or cast parts, characterized in that

the parts are jointly oxidized (blued) and hardened in a
furnace by means of passing or atomizing a reducing and

oxidizing reaction gas in the furnace space at hardening
temperatures, a slightly oxidizing gas atmosphere being

created.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a methanol/water mixture is used to produce the

reaction gas.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that in order to produce the reaction gas a liquid is

used which is atomized and diluted by means of gaseous
nitrogen.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the reaction gas is produced by

atomizing in that part of the furnace in which the parts
are heated to the final temperature during hardening.
