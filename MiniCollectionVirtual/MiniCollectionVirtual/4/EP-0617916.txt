<ABSTRACT>
A multielectrode probe to be 
inserted into a patient when in use 

includes a base (31) on which a plurality of signal lines (20) 
are bonded. Each of the plurality of signal lines has 

at least one electrode (33), and these electrodes are 
arranged on the base with predetermined spacings 

between them. The electrodes are formed by stripping 
the isolating coatings (24) of the plurality of signal 

lines (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multielectrode
probe for use in an electrophysiology test performed
prior to therapies for tachycardiac arrhythmia such as
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or paroxysmal
supraventricular tachycardia, and a method of
manufacturing the same.Conventionally, an electrophysiology test
performed prior to therapies for tachycardiac
arrhythmia is performed by using a plurality of cardiac
catheters. The arrangement of each cardiac catheter is
that one or two to six electrodes are formed around the
tip of a hollow catheter, and lead wires are extended
through this hollow catheter and connected to a
measurement device. Measurements for a left heart
portion are performed by inserting the catheter into a
coronary sinus. However, since it is difficult to
insert the catheter into a right coronary artery,
measurements for a right heart portion must be
performed by moving the position one point after
another from inside a ventricle, resulting in a very 
cumbersome examination. Consequently, one examination
requires a few hours.This conventional examination method further has
the following problems. First, since the examination
is done by using the catheters each having few
electrodes, finding a portion to be diagnosed, such as
an accessory pathway, is time-consuming. In addition,
since the number of the electrodes is small, the
distance between the individual electrodes must be
increased to measure a wide region. This makes it
difficult to accurately find the accessory pathway.
Furthermore, the use of a plurality of catheters
imposes a large load on a patient.To solve the above problem that a portion to be
diagnosed is difficult to find, it may be possible to
increase the number of electrodes. If, however, the
number of electrodes of the conventional electrode
catheter is increased, the number of signal lines for
transmitting signals must also be increased, resulting
in a large outer diameter of the catheter. This
consequently makes it difficult to insert the catheter
into a right coronary artery in examining a right heart
portion. In addition, since an electrode is formed at
the end of a signal line, an operation for connecting
the signal line and the electrode is required. This 
makes the manufacture of a multielectrode catheter more difficult.US patent 4 890 623 describes a multielectrode probe formed by winding a
printed circuit board helically around a substrate (which can be comprise a
lumen). A plurality of conductors are printed longitudinally on the circuit board
terminating
