<ABSTRACT>
A projection exposure apparatus having an illuminating 
system (1 - 14) for irradiating a mask (R) having a pattern 

with illuminating light and a projection optical system 
(PL) for taking in light emanating from the pattern of the 

mask (R) and for projecting an image of the pattern onto a 
photosensitive substrate (W). The projection exposure 

apparatus further includes a phase plane (PF) disposed in 
or near a Fourier transform plate (FTP) in an image forming 

optical path between the mask (R) and the photosensitive 
substrate (W) so that the amplitude of light passing 

through a circular region (FA) of radius r₁ which is 
centred on an optical axis (AX) of the projection optical 

system at the Fourier transform plane (FTP) or a plane near 
it and the amplitude of light passing through an outer 

region (FB) which lies outwardly of the circular region 
(FA) are made different in phase from one another by the 

phase plate, and a movable member (WST) for moving an 
image forming plane of the projection optical system (PL) 

and the photosensitive substrate (W) relative to one 
another along the optical axis (AX) of the projection 

optical system (PL) when the image of the mask pattern is 
projected onto the photosensitive substrate (W). The 

radius r₁ and the ratio t of the amplitude of light 
passing through the circular region (FA) to the amplitude 

of light passing through the outer region (FB) are 
determined so as to satisfy the following condition:

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for projection exposure used for forming fine
patterns in semiconductor integrated circuits, liquid
crystal displays, etc.A projection optical system used in a projection
exposure apparatus of the type described above is
incorporated in the apparatus after high-level optical
designing, careful selection of a glassy material,
ultraprecise processing, and precise assembly adjustment.
The present semiconductor manufacturing process mainly uses
a stepper in which a reticle (mask) is irradiated with the
i-line (wavelength: 365 nm) of a mercury-vapor lamp as
illuminating light, and light passing through a circuit
pattern on the reticle is focused on a photosensitive
substrate (e.g., a wafer) through a projection optical
system, thereby forming an image of the circuit pattern on
the substrate. Recently, an excimer stepper that employs
an excimer laser (KrF laser of wavelength 248 nm) as an
illuminating light source has also been used. When a
projection optical system for such an excimer stepper only
comprises a refracting lens, usable glassy materials are
limited to quartz, fluorite, and so forth.Generally speaking, in order to faithfully transfer
a fine reticle pattern onto a photosensitive substrate by
exposure using a projection optical system, the resolution
and focal depth or depth of focus (DOF) of the projection
optical system are important factors. Among projection
optical systems which are presently put to practical use,
there is a projection optical system having a numerical
aperture (NA) of about 0.6 and employing the i-line. In
general, when the wavelength of illuminating light employed
is kept constant, as the numerical aperture of the
projection optical system is increased, the resolution
improves correspondingly. In general, however, the focal
depth (DOF) decreases as the numerical aperture NA
increases. The focal depth is defined by DOF = ± λ/NA2, 
where λ is the wavelength of illuminating light. It should
be noted that when the illuminating light is reduced in
wavelength, the resolution improves, but that the focal
depth decreases with the reduction in wavelength.In the meantime, even if the resolution is improved
by increasing the numerical aperture NA of the projection
optical system, the focal depth (focus margin) DOF decreases
in inverse proportion to the square of the numerical
aperture, as shown in the above expression of DOF = ± λ/NA2.
Accordingly, even if a projection optical system having a
high numerical aperture can be produced, the
