<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for reestablishing a call after a call has been disconnected or after the quality of the call has become bad is disclosed. A disconnected mobile station scans the signal strength of surrounding base stations and accesses the base station with the highest signal strength. The mobile station then initiates a new call back to a service node. The base station then assigns the mobile station a traffic channel and the service node reconnects the call. In addition, a method for reestablishing a call in any communication network after the call has been terminated in a normal fashion is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to any communication system and
in particular to mobile radio communication systems. The
present invention provides to a generic call reestablishment
procedure when a connection is unwillfully lost or when the
quality of the call is bad. The present invention also
provides for associated apparatus.In cellular mobile radio systems, it is not unusual for a
radio connection to be lost. The radio connection can be lost
for a variety of reasons including fading when the mobile
station is standing still, radio shadow from large buildings
or tunnels, a handoff to a radio channel which can not support
the new connection or when a base station breaks down or for
some emergency must be switched off. As a result, a reestablishment
routine is used in cellular systems to reconnect
the lost connection.Figure 1 illustrates a prior art system for reestablishing a
call in a cellular radio system. In this example, a standard
telephone 109 communicates via a public switched telephone
network PSTN (not shown) and a cellular radio communication
system with a mobile radio station 104. The cellular radio
communication system includes two radio base stations 101 and
102, which are both connected to the same mobile services
switching center 103 by connections 107 and 108, respectively.
In Figure 1, the mobile station 104 is communicating with
telephone 109 through base station 101. When the mobile
station is moving toward the base station 102, it may become
necessary to handoff the mobile station 104 from base station 
101 to base station 102. However, if the mobile station 104
is disconnected from the base station 101 before receiving a
handoff order to the new base station 102, the mobile station
may initiate a reestablishment routine.In this known reestablishment routine, the mobile station 104
scans the signal strengths of the surrounding base stations
and selects the base station with the highest or next highest
signal strength. The mobile station 104 then accesses the
selected base station, base station 102 in this example, and
requests to be reconnected. The selected base station reports
the request for reconnection to the mobile services switching
center 103. The mobile services switching center 103 then
orders the selected base station to assign a traffic channel
to the mobile station 104, and the mobile services switching
center 103 then connects the mobile station to the remaining
segment of the call which has been parked in the mobile
services switching center 103.In the European

<CLAIMS>
A method for reestablishing a call after the call has been disconnected involving
a terminal (204) and an opposite party (212) in a communication system, wherein a first

radio communication path has been established between the terminal and a first radio
station (201) before the disconnection of the call and a second radio communication

path is established between the terminal and a second radio station (202) after the
disconnection of the call, said method characterized by the steps of:


establishing a wired communication path (S401, S403, S405) from the second
radio station to a meeting point selected by a service node (207) common to a plurality

of such communication paths, at which meeting point the parties of the call are
connected together; and
initiating a new call back (S407) across said second radio communication path to
said meeting point, wherein said terminal initiates said call back to said meeting point

using an interaction number which is different from a called party's number and is
entered and stored prior to call disconnection in said terminal or in equipment

permanently connected to said terminal wherein further in said meeting point, upon
receiving said interaction number, the terminal (204) is reconnected to the opposite

party (S411; 212).
A method for reestablishing a call after the call has been disconnected according
to claim 1, wherein said interaction number is sent to said terminal (204) during call

setup.
A method for reestablishing a call after the call has been disconnected according
to claim 1 or 2, wherein said interaction number is inserted via a key set on said

terminal.
A method for reestablishing a call after the call has been disconnected according
to claim 1 or 2, wherein said new call is initiated automatically after the call has been

disconnected. 
A method for reestablishing a call according to any one claims 1-4 wherein said
call is disconnected when it is determined to have a quality level considered below an

acceptable level by a subscriber participating in the call.
A method for reestablishing a call according to claim 5, wherein said new call is
initiated after the quality of the call has fallen below a predetermined level for a

predetermined period of time and a subscriber depresses at least one key on a keyset on
said terminal (204).
An apparatus for reestablishing a call from a terminal (204) after the call has
been disconnected in a communication system, wherein a first radio communication

path has been established between the terminal and a first radio station (201) before the
disconnection of the call and a second radio communication path is established between

the terminal and the second radio station (202) after the disconnection of the call,

characterized by providing:

a means for establishing a wired communication path (S401, S403, S405) from
the second radio station to a meeting point selected by a service node (207) common to

a plurality of such communication paths, at which meeting point the parties of the call
are connected together;
a means for initiating a new call back (S407) across said second
radiocommunication path to said meeting point, wherein the terminal initiates the call

back to said meeting point using an interaction number which is different from a called
party's number and is entered and stored prior to call disconnection in said terminal or

in equipment permanently connected to said terminal; and
a means for reconnecting the terminal to the opposite party upon receiving the
interaction number.
A method for reestablishing a call after a normal termination (701) involving a
terminals (601, 641) in a communication system, said method characterized by the steps

of: 

establishing a wired communication path (610 or 630) from the terminals to a
meeting point (620) selected by a service node common to a plurality of such

communication paths, at which meeting point the parties of the call are connected
together;
depressing (702) a predetermined key or sequence of keys on a keyset on one of
said terminals after the call has been terminated; and
determining (703) whether the terminal has an active call record with an
interaction number, said interaction number being different from a called party's

number wherein in said meeting point, upon receiving said interaction number (704)
said terminal is reconnected to the opposite party.
A method for reestablishing a call after a normal termination according to claim
8, wherein said call record remains active after the termination for a predetermined

period of time.
A method for reestablishing a call after a normal termination according to claim
8 or 9, wherein either party can initiate the reestablishment method.
A method for reestablishing a call after a normal termination according to any
one of claims 8-11, wherein an acoustic signal is generated (705) when the call can not

be reestablished.

communication paths, at which meeting point the parties of the call are connected
together;
means (702) on said terminals for initiating the reestablishment procedure after
the call has been terminated;

with an interaction number, said interaction number being different from a called

party's number; and a means (704) for reconnecting said terminals upon receiving the
interaction number.
