<ABSTRACT>
A CPVC adhesive for joining CPVC pipes comprises: 
(a) about 18 to 28 wt% CPVC resin; (b) a high vapor pressure 

solvent comprising about 15 to 35 wt% tetrahydrofuran 
and 0 to about 30 wt% methyl ethyl ketone; and (c) a 

low vapor pressure solvent comprising about 20 to 45 wt% 
cyclohexanone, 0 to about 30 wt% N-methyl pyrrolidone, 

and 0 to 10 wt% dibasic esters (a mixture of refined dimethyl 
esters of adipic, glutaric, and succinic acids). 

The VOC level of the CPVC adhesive composition of the invention 
is at or below the allowed maximum value of 450 

g/1, yet the adhesive meets or exceeds required performance 
standards, such as hydrostatic burst strength and 

hydrostatic sustained pressure test.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to thermoplastic 
pipe adhesives, and, more particularly, to adhesives 
used for joining CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) 
pipe. Specifically, the CPVC pipe adhesives disclosed 
and claimed herein are solvent-based, having an 
environmentally-acceptable VOC (volatile organic compounds) 
content. Solvent-based adhesives, or cements, have been in 
use for joining thermoplastic pipe for over 30 years. 
The development of these adhesives is largely responsible 
for growth of the thermoplastic pipe industry. Several 
billion pounds of plastic pipe are produced each year in 
North America. Rapid-setting, solvent-based adhesives 
weld the pipes together in a timely manner. These rapid-setting 
adhesives allow for the testing and troubleshooting 
of piping systems in a matter of hours while 
maintaining the long-term durability of the pipe itself. 
These characteristics, rapid set, ease of use, long-term 
durability along with low-cost, have made the joining of  
 
plastic pipe by solvent-based adhesives a practical and 
economic system. The solvent-based adhesives work primarily by two 
means of action. First, the solvent portion of the formulation 
softens the outer surfaces of the pipe through 
solvation of the plastic. Subsequently, the adhesive 
joint 'cures' (hardens) by means of the solvents evaporating 
to the surrounding atmosphere from the pipe. Secondly, 
the resin dissolved in the adhesive dries through 
solvent evaporation and provides continuity between the 
welded pipe surfaces which aid in preserving the integrity 
of the entire pipe system. These adhesives cure rapidly (within a matter of 
hours), often allowing piping systems to be tested the 
same day as constructed. However, perhaps the most important 
benefit of these solvent-based adhesives is the 
maintenance of the integrity of the pipe itself. The 
resin is the same as the plastic pipe and/or fitting material. 
This provides a high degree of long-term durability 
for the piping system, often up to 30 to 40 years 
of useful life. This is essential for these systems 
which are built into the structures of homes and buildings, 
or are buried underground. Thousands of miles of thermoplastic piping systems 
are constructed each day throughout the world, primarily 
by the means previously described. These systems are 
used in the transfer of potable water for drinking; residential 
hot and cold water systems; drain, waste, and 
vent (DWV) applications in home and industry; turf and 
agricultural
