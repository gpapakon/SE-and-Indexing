<ABSTRACT>
In a device for setting wheels (4) in inline roller skates (1) wherein the axles of the wheels (4) pass through openings in a frame (3) and are mounted in an intermediate frame (6), where the inside width of the openings (14) in the frame (3) is greater than the outside diameter of the axles (7) and the intermediate frame (6) can be attached to the frame (3) at at least two different heights, the intermediate frame (6) can be set with positive and nonpositive attachment at at least two different heights by means of an insertion pin (10) which passes through the frame (3) and the free flanges of the intermediate frame (6), thus allowing a simple setting of at least some of the wheels at different heights on the frame without recourse to special tools.

<CLAIMS>
A device for mounting rollers in in-line roller skates, in 
which the roller axles extend through openings in a frame and 

are mounted in free legs of a sub-frame attachable to the frame, 
wherein the clearance of the openings of the frame is larger 

than the outer diameter of the roller axles and the sub-frame is 
connectable with the frame in at least two different height 

positions, characterised in that the sub-frame (6, 19) is 
capable of being positively or frictionally fixed in at least 

two different height positions via an insert member (10) 
extending through the frame (3) and the free legs of the sub-frame 

(6, 19). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
attachment of the sub-frame (6, 19) in the frame (3) is attained 

via an eccentric provided on the insert member (10) or 
cooperating therewith, respectively, the eccentric projecting 

through the free legs of the sub-frame (6, 19) and the frame 
(3). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the different height positions of the sub-frame (6) relative to 

the frame (3) are delimited by elastic insert members or stops 
(10), respectively, fixable on the sub-frame (6), such as 

washers, between the web (18) connecting the free legs of the 
sub-frame (6) and the sole of the roller skate (1) or the inner 

side of the frame (3), respectively. 
A device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the legs of the sub-frame (6) comprise at least one aligned 

recess in the region of the web (18) of the sub-frame (6) for an 
insert member or stop (10), respectively, insertable through the 

openings and externally engaging over the web (18). 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
insertable insert member or stop (10), respectively, has a slot 

(16) extending in parallel to the longitudinal axis (17) of the 
insert member or stop (10), respectively, externally of this  

 
longitudinal axis (17). 
A device according to any one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the eccentric (10), at a free end thereof, 

carries a tension lever (11) pivotable transversely to a 
longitudinal axis of the eccentric (10) and having a cam which 

causes a tension force against an external surface of the frame 
(3) when the tension lever (11) is pivoted.
