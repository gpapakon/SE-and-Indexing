<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surfactant containing, 
liquid compositions based on the magnesium salt of primary 
alcohol sulphates and non-ionic surfactants. General purpose household cleaning compositions (GPC's) for 
hard surfaces such as metal, glass, ceramic, plastic and 
linoleum surfaces are commercially available in both 
powdered and liquid form. Powdered cleaning compositions 
consist mainly of builder or buffering salts such as 
phosphates, carbonates, silicates etc. Such compositions 
display good inorganic soil removal, but they can be 
deficient in cleaning ability on organic soils such as the 
calcium and/or magnesium salts of fatty acids and 
fatty/greasy soils typically found in the domestic 
environment. Such compositions are generally buffered at an 
alkaline pH by the builder, and as it is generally believed 
that alkaline pH facilitates the detergency of free fatty 
acids by conversion into the corresponding soap. Liquid cleaning compositions generally comprise an organic 
solvent and have the great advantage that they can be 
applied to hard surfaces in neat or concentrated form so 
that a relatively high level of surfactant material and 
organic solvent is directly delivered onto the soil. These 
liquid compositions are of utility in the cleaning of hard  
 
surfaces such as floors and walls and kitchen or bathroom 
surfaces as mentioned above and in cleaning soft furnishings 
such as upholstery, carpets, curtains etc. Typically, the surfactants used in commercial general 
purpose cleaners include one or both of linear alkyl benzene 
sulphonates and secondary alkane sulphonates (SAS). The incorporation of certain surfactants into such 
solvent/water compositions presents no difficulties when 
these surfactants are present at relatively low 
concentrations. European Patent EP 0344847 (P&G) discloses 
compositions comprising butoxy-propanol solvents in 
combination with up to 5%wt sodium linear C8-C18 alkyl 
benzene sulphonate. Mixtures of linear alkyl benzene sulphonates with alcohol 
ethoxylates and optionally small amounts of fatty soaps 
comprise the surfactant system used in a number of 
successful, alkaline, commercial products. A further outstanding technical problem with such 
compositions is that the surfactants most commonly used, are 
less biodegradable and consequently less preferable 
environmentally than other surfactant systems. In particular, primary alcohol sulphate (hereinafter 
referred to as PAS) is an environmentally desirable anionic 
surfactant, both due to
