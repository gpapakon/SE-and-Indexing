<ABSTRACT>
In a data transmission system 1, a center 3 and a 
plurality of terminals 5 are connected by a coaxial cable 7. 

The center 3 is controlled by a server 11 to transmit mode 
sense polling signals in succession every predetermined time 

(for example every 30 seconds) to all of the karaoke 
terminals 5 connected to the center 3. The center 3 determines 

whether each terminal 5 is in a karaoke mode or not 
based on the mode response signal transmitted from each 

terminal 5 in response to the mode sense polling signals. 
The center 3 then transmits request polling signal only to 

terminals 5 determined as being in the karaoke mode, confirms 
whether a request for a song has been made, and transmits 

karaoke data to those terminals that have a request.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transmission 
system wherein a central control unit and a plurality of 
terminals are connected by a transmission line, the data 
transmission system being for transmitting information data 
from the central control unit to the terminals. Conventionally, there is known a data transmission 
system, wherein a center (central control unit) is connected 
to a plurality of terminals by a transmission line. The data 
transmission system is for transmitting information data 
including various types of information to a terminal from a 
center according to demands from the terminal side. An 
advantage of this type of data transmission system is that a 
memory device for prestoring data information need not be 
provided to each terminal, so that the terminals have an 
extremely simple construction. In the data transmission system, it can be proposed 
that transmission and reception of the information data is 
controlled by polling between the center and the terminal. 
That is, a polling signal is transmitted in succession from 
the center to the plurality of terminals. Every terminal is  
 
interrogated to determine which requests transmission of 
information data. When there is a transmission request at a 
terminal that has received the polling signal, the request 
data, which indicates the content and the like of the 
request, is transmitted from the terminal to the center. 
After the signal has been received at the center side, the 
desired information data is transmitted to the terminal. According to this method, however, because the data 
transmission system interrogates about data transmission 
requests at all the terminals in succession, a transmission 
request made at a terminal will not be responded to until 
polling for all other terminals is completed. This will 
cause a problem in that a long time is required for the 
desired data to be transmitted from the center. 
Particularly, a large scale system with outdoor cables can 
have a great many terminals so that information data can not 
be transmitted quickly to individual terminals. It is therefore, an object of the present invention 
to overcome the above-described problems and to provide a 
data transmission system wherein a terminal can obtain 
desired information data with a short waiting time. The present invention provides a data transmission system for 
controlling transmission of information data via a 
transmission line from a central control unit to a plurality  
 
of terminals, the data transmission
