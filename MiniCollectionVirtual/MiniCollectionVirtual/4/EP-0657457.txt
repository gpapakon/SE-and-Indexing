<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel N,N'-difluorinated
diazabicycloalkane derivatives useful as
electrophilic fluorinating agents. It provides said N,N'-difluorinated
diazabicycloalkane derivatives, processes for
the preparation thereof and their use as fluorinating
agents. The invention further provides novel N-fluorinated
azaazoniabicycloalkane-Lewis acid adduct intermediates
formed in said processes.There is a demand for fluorinating agents which are
site-selective towards organic, especially carbanionic,
substrates, especially for use in the preparation of
pharmacologically active compounds. A number of such
electrophilic fluorinating agents are known but, until
recently, were limited in their commercial utility in that
they were expensive, hazardous, inconvenient to handle,
lack stability and/or insufficiently selective for general
use.US-A-5086178 discloses that N-fluorinated diazabicycloalkane
derivatives represented by the following
Formula A:

   wherein:
n represents 0, 1 or 2; R represents a quaternizing organic group;each R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 independently represents
hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, aryl, C1-C6 alkyl-substituted
aryl or aryl-substituted C1-C6 alkyl;
andeach X- independently represents a counterion or
2X- represents a single divalent counterion,
are stable, effective electrophilic fluorinating agents.US-A-5086178 discloses a process for preparing the
compounds of Formula A wherein the corresponding
N-substituted diazabicycloalkane derivative of the
following Formula B are fluorinated

   wherein n, R, R1 to R5, and X- are as defined above.When fluoride is not required as a counterion in the
N-substituted diazabicycloalkane derivative of Formula A,
the fluorination is conducted in the presence of an alkali
metal salt to provide the required counterion or an alkali
metal salt is added to the fluorination product in a
separate step to replace the fluoride ion. However, this
procedure involves the formation of an alkali metal
fluoride by-product and the product is difficult to free
from the resulting F- and adventitious HF-2 ions. Further, a
substantial quantity of organic solvent, usually acetonitrile,
is required in order to avoid co-precipitation of 
the product.It was unexpectedly found that these problems could be
overcome by addition of a readily fluorinatable Lewis acid
prior to, during, or after the fluorination step. The term
"readily fluorinatable Lewis acid" means a Lewis acid (Y)
which readily combines with F- to form YF- and includes
adducts of the free Lewis acid, such as
