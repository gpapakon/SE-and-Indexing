<DESCRIPTION>
Title: Benzoate Esters of Al oxylatedMethyl GlucosidesSPECIFICATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to improved ester compositions, and more particularly to certain benzoate esters of ethoxylated and propoxylated methyl glucosides which are useful as foam modifiers, emollients, conditioners, and clarifiers.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTNumerous references describe the production and use of benzoic acid esters. None of these references teach or suggest the specific novel benzoate esters of this invention or the use of these benzoate esters as foam modifiers, clarity enhancers, emulsification enhancers, or conditioners for hair shampoo and hair conditioners. More specifically:U.S. Pat. No. 3,714,228 to Massie describes the reaction of benzoic acid with benzyl alcohol in the presence of a catalyst to produce benzyl benzoate. Other compounds produced are benzyl acetate, benzyl propionate, etc.U.S. Pat. No. 3,758,547 to Robin, et al., describes a process for reacting benzoic acid with anSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 amino alcohol using certain catalysts.U.S. Pat. No. 3,916,008 to Green, et al.. describes a class of esters which are useful for the control of serum cholesterol levels in animals and man. One group of esters included within the invention include the esters of the surfactants sold under the trade name "Tetronic 701" and "Tetronic 702". Reference is made to formula II, wherein the groups R.,, R^ R3, and R4 include benzyl and substituted benzyl. U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,848 to Snapp Jr. , et al. , describes a series of ether-diester derivatives of p- dioxanone having a formula: 0 0II II R'-C-0CH2CH20CH2C-0Rwherein R* is an alkyl of from 1 to 7 carbon atoms or the phenyl moiety and R is an alkyl of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms.U.S. Pat. No. 4,243,799 to Mueller.et al.. describes a process for the preparation of polybutylene glycol carboxylic acid diesters.U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,222 and 4,322,545 to Scala.Jr. describes benzoic acid esters of linear primary alcohols and their use as diluents, solvents and 
platicizers, and liquid carriers.U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,694 to Scala, Jr. , describes benzoic acid esters of linear and branched alcohols and their use in toiletry and cosmetic formulations.U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,693 to Scala, Jr.. describes benzoic acid esters of isostearyl (C18) alcohol and their use in toiletry and cosmetic formulations.U.S. Pat. No. 4,359,478 to Schomolka describes certain polyoxybutylene-polyoxyethylene block copolymers and their mono or diesters for use
