<ABSTRACT>
The method for protecting motor vehicles against theft involves cutting an identification marking into the windows thereof. So as not to adversely affect the strength of the windows, the identification marking, for example the chassis number, is first of all incorporated into a flat template (10), for example in the form of a 0.1 mm thick steel strip. The identification marking is then engraved through the template (10) into the motor vehicle window by means of an engraving needle (18) driven in a vibrating manner by a motor. The depth of the engraving is limited to less than 0.1 mm by resting a spacing element (14), which is connected to the engraving needle (18) or to the guide thereof, against the template (10).
