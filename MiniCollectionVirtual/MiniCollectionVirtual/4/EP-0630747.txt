<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multilayer wrapping
films having good hygienic properties, good transparency,
good mechanical strength, low-temperature heat-sealing
properties, good automatic wrapping aptitude, and excellent
economical properties.Methods of film wrapping include various wrapping
methods utilizing the characteristics of each film, such as
sealing in the form of a bag, an overlapping method, a
stretch wrapping method and a spin packing method. A single
layer film using forms of a common resin, such as
polyethylene, polypropylene or polyvinyl chloride, is
generally employed as the film in these methods. However,
with the increasingly demanding specification now required
for wrapping film, the variety of wrapping film, and the
change in social needs, the number of applications in which
these known films cannot be employed has increased.For example, in one wrapping method food, such as
fruit, fresh fish, fresh meat or vegetables is directly
placed onto a plastic tray, and stretch wrapped with a film
which, hitherto, has usually been formed of vinyl chloride
resin. Recently, because of hygiene safety standards and
the increasing consciousness of the earth's environment,
films of an ethylene resin, such as a low-density
polyethylene resin or an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer
have been employed in place of the conventional polyvinyl 
chloride, as these pose fewer problems in respect of hygiene
safety standards and environmental pollution.However, in the case of using, for example, a low-density
polyethylene resin alone, it is impossible to
simultaneously satisfy the self-adhesive property, the low-temperature
heat sealing property, and the flexibility
required of a film. When employing an ethylene-vinyl
acetate copolymer resin film, by suitably selecting the
content of vinyl acetate and the molecular weight of the
copolymer, the problems associated with the use of low-density
polyethylene resin film described above, could be
solved to some extent, but if a corner of the supporting
tray was sharp or food having a sharp projection was being
packed, the problem occurred that the film became torn.The present inventors have previously proposed a
multilayer wrapping film aimed at simultaneously providing
the necessary properties by combining an ethylene polymer
layer and a propylene copolymer layer, as described in the
specifications of Japanese Patent Application Nos. 4-195210,
5-150366, 5-150367, 5-150368, and 4-195214.However, although in order to produce such a
multilayer film economically and
