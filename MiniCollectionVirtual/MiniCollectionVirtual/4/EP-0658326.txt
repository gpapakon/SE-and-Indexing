<ABSTRACT>
Each means of guidance between each side wall of the cabinet or rack 
and each side panel of the drawer consists of an upwardly sloping 

guide groove (5) which is open at one end and closed at the other 
end and is provided with protrusions (6) over at least part of its 

length and behind which guide pins (9-10) are hooked in order to 
lock the drawer (12) with which they work in conjunction into a 

chosen withdrawn sloping or horizontal position, where the guide 
groove and the guide pins engaging in it are installed on the inner 

surface of the side wall (3) of the cabinet (1) and the side panel of 
the drawer (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display cabinet with an open front or open rack
in which several drawers are stacked one above the other and
positioned so that they slope downwards and in which small articles
such as cigarette boxes are arranged.Such a display cabinet is known, whereby there are provided means of
guidance between each side panel of the cabinet or rack and the
adjacent side wall of each drawer which allow the drawers to be
installed in the cabinet so that they slope and can be slid in and out
of the cabinet.Also in the U.S. Patent 2.953.254 is described a filing office frame
in which basket-like insets are provided for office papers. The frame
comprises guide rails capable of accomodating said insets and having a
vertical projection in the center. The insets are provided with
rollers for engagement with said rails whereby said insets are forced
to take up an inclined position on said projections when moved in said
rails for withdrawal from said frame.However such display cabinet or frame has the disadvantage that it is
not possible to give a desired sloping or horizontal position to the
drawers and to lock them in the assumed position.In order to remedy these disadvantages a display cabinet has been
realized as described in independent claim 1.As a result the drawers can be filled without difficulty with the 
desired articles and positioned in a sloping position so that the
articles are easily visible.Particular embodiments of the invention are defined in
dependent claims 2 to 6.By way of example and without being in any way exhaustive, a
description of a preferred embodiment of a display cabinet pursuant to
the invention is given below. This description refers to the attached
drawing where :
fig. 1 shows a partial perspective view of the display cabinet;fig. 2 shows a partial perspective view of a guide slat with a guiding
groove in accordance with the invention, to be fastened on or in the
internal surface of the sidewalls of the display cabinet.In these figures a display cabinet 1 with open front 2 can be seen.
In the inner surface of each of the two side panels 3 of the display
cabinet 1 several upward sloping guide slats 4 are fitted at the top
and at a distance from one another. Each guide sat 4 has a
longitudinal guide groove 5 of which the lower lengthways edge is
provided with several teeth 6 which serve as strikers. Below, the
guide groove has a Vee shaped part 7 which finishes in a horizontal
open insertion section 8 which is located on the front of the display
cabinet. Two guide

<CLAIMS>
Display cabinet (1) with open front (2) or open rack and
provided with several drawers (12) stacked one above the other in

which articles for display and sale, such as cigarette boxes, are
arranged, where there are means of guidance between each side panel

(3) of the cabinet or rack and the adjacent side wall of each drawer
(12) which allow the drawers to be installed in the cabinet so that

they slope and be slid in and out of the cabinet, characterized by the
fact that each means of guidance consists of a guide groove (5)

running upwards and which is open at one end and closed at the
other end and is provided with protrusions (6) over at least part of

its length and behind which guide pins (9-10) are hooked in order to
lock the drawer (12) with which they work in conjunction into a

chosen withdrawn horizontal or sloping position, where the guide
groove and the guide pins engaging in them are installed on the inner

surface of the side wall (3) of the cabinet (1) and the side panel of
the drawer (12).
Display cabinet in accordance with claim 1, characterized by the
fact that the protrusions consist of teeth (6) which are fitted in the

lower longitudinal edge of the guide groove (5).
Display cabinet in accordance with claim 1, characterized by the
fact that the guide groove (5) at the bottom runs into a Vee shaped

part (7) that extends into a horizontal open front section (8).
Display cabinet in accordance with claim 1, characterized by the
fact that the guide groove (5) with protrusions (6) is provided in a

guide sat (4) which is fastened on the inner surface of the side
panels (3) of the cabinet (1) and in which there are two guide pins

(9-10) on the adjacent side panel of the drawer.
Display cabinet in accordance with claim 1, characterized by the
fact that the upper end of the guide groove (5) ends in a curved 

section (5') which runs upwards and towards the front of the
cabinet.
Display cabinet in accordance with claims 1 to 5, characterized by
the fact that the lowest guide grooves facing one another (5) have an

angle of slope which is less than that of the guide grooves which lie
above them, so that the sliding
 in and out of the drawer (12) is not
impeded.
