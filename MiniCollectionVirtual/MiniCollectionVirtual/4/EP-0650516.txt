<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing acetylene from a hydrocarbon stream comprises exposing the stream to a hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of an acetylene converter modifier which substantially remains on the catalyst and does not unsubstantially migrate into the stream. Exposure is under conditions which are effective to support acetylene hydrogenation with enhanced selectivity. The moderator, which may be arsine or phosphine, is used at a low concentration level and serves to prevent temperature runaway during the exothermic acetylene hydrogenation reaction. By controlling the presence of moderator levels to such a relatively low level, temperature runaway during the highly exothermic acetylene hydrogenation reaction is prevented while maintaining acceptable catalyst activity levels for purposes of the acetylene hydrogenation reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the removal of acetylene from hydrocarbon
streams; particularly but not exclusively to the production of ethylene which is
substantially free of acetylene; and especially to minimizing the contamination of
ethylene by acetylene produced by stream cracking. In an especially preferred
aspect, the present invention is directed to selective acetylene hydrogenation over
a palladium catalyst using arsine or phosphine as an acetylene converter
moderator.In the production of hydrocarbons such as ethylene, the presence of
acetylene is undesirable, but one of the by-products from streamcracking is
acetylene. Therefore, there has been a general concern for minimizing the
presence of acetylene in ethylene. Conventional procedures which have been
proposed to eliminate the deleterious effects of the presence of acetylene in
ethylene include the selective hydrogenation of acetylene over a palladium
catalyst.Inasmuch as acetylene hydrogenation is a highly exothermic reaction, it
has been necessary to add a moderator during the reaction to enhance selectivity.
A conventional acetylene converter moderator which is typically employed for this
purpose is carbon monoxide, as discussed in United Catalysts Inc.'s recent
"Quality Products & Services" brochure relating to palladium catalyst systems on
page 5. Normally, carbon monoxide is added at concentrations of from 1 ppm -5
ppm, and acts as a temporary poison.It has been observed that the carbon monoxide does not remain on the
catalyst surface but ends up in the product ethylene. This is unacceptable
inasmuch as carbon. 
monoxide is a recognized poison and carbon monoxide contamination of product
ethylene can be a problem for downstream polymerization processes, e.g., in the
production of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density
polyethylene (LLDPE).The present invention is based on the identification of acetylene converter
moderators which are substances which remain on the catalyst surface and do not
migrate into the product ethylene stream. The acetylene converter moderators
required for purposes of the present invention are arsine and phosphine, more
preferably arsine. The following prior art is therefore discussed with reference to
the use of arsine as moderator.It is generally known that high levels of arsine tend to poison acetylene
converter catalysts.US-A-4,227,025 (Phillips Petroleum Co.) is directed to a process for the
removal of acetylene from cracked gases obtained from conversion processes in
which crude oil

A process for removing acetylene from a hydrocarbon stream, said stream
comprising an acetylene converter moderator, by contacting the stream with

an acetylene hydrogenation catalyst under conditions effective to permit
acetylene hydrogenation,
