<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an assembly for the take-up and feed of the weft on a positive-transfer weaving machine, using insertion members, such as lances or bands, equipped with grippers, with exchange in the middle of the forming fabric. The gripper which feeds the weft (2) to the exchange point comprises, in addition to a main device (3, 4, 5) for clamping the weft, a weft-retention device (7) located on the same side as the main clamping device. The retention device (7) comprises two levers (11, 12) mounted pivotably in the same plane along respective transverse axes (6, 17) and describing simultaneous and opposed pivoting movements by means of a suitable mechanical connection (19, 20), in order to offer a wide passage for the weft (2) in the open position, whilst holding it effectively in the closed position. This gripper is used particularly for very coarse wefts or wefts consisting of fancy thread.

Clamp for an assembly for catching and inserting the 
weft on a positive-transfer weaving loom, using insertion 

means such as rods or bands fitted with clamps at their 
ends, with a change-over from one clamp to the other in 

the centre of the fabric being woven, the clamp which 
inserts the weft (2) to the change-over point comprising, 

in addition to a main clamping device (3, 4, 5) for the 
weft (2), a retaining device (7) for the weft (2), 

located on the side of the main clamping device (3, 4, 
5), 
characterised in that
 the retaining device (7) for 
the weft (2) comprises a first lever (11) mounted to 

pivot about a transverse axis (6), a second lever (12) 
mounted to pivot substantially in the same plane as the 

first, about a transverse axis (17), and control means 
(6, 14, 15, 19, 20) for the simultaneous pivoting 

movement of both levers (11, 12) in opposite directions, 
in a direction spreading them apart, synchronously with 

opening of the main clamping device (3, 4, 5), and in a 
direction bringing them together, synchronously with 

closure of the main clamping device (3, 4, 5), the two 
levers (11, 12) being configured towards their respective  

 
to the weft (2) in the open position, and to surround the 

weft (2) entirely in the closed position. 
Clamp for an assembly for catching and inserting the 
weft according to claim 1, characterised in that the two 

levers (11, 12) of the retaining device (7) for the weft 
(2) are mounted to pivot about separate transverse axes 

(6, 17) located one in front of the other, the axis of 
pivoting (6) of the first lever (11) being common with 

that of a lever (5) of the main clamping device, and 
these two levers (11, 5) being conjoined in rotation, 

while the axis of pivoting (17) of the second lever (12) 
of the retaining device (7) is located at an intermediate 

point of this lever (12), which is mechanically connected 
to the first lever (11) by the co-operation of a driving 

axle (19) and of a hole (20), the driving axle (19) being 
carried by the first lever (11) at an intermediate point, 

and the hole (20) through which this axle (19) passes 
being provided in the rear region of the second lever 

(12), or vice versa.  
 
Clamp for an assembly for catching and inserting the 
weft according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 

first lever (11) of the retaining device (7) for the weft 
(2) has, towards its free end, a notch (16) open in the 

direction of the free end of the second lever (12), which 
latter comprises a slot (18) the edge of which partially 

covers the notch (16) in the closed position, in order to 
define a type of eye (21) through which the weft (2) 

passes.
