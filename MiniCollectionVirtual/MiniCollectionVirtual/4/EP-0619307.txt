<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-halogenopyridine derivatives of the general formula (I) 
<

  in which     X represents halogen and Y represents halogeno, nitro, formyl, cyano, carboxyl, carbamoyl, alkyl, halogenoalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, dialkoxyalkyl, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl or dialkylaminocarbonyl, with the exception of compounds in which X represents chlorine and Y simultaneously methyl,  which is characterised in that,  in a first step, pyridine 1-oxides of the general formula (II)

 represents an anion formed from an electrophilic compound, if appropriate the compounds of the formula (III) are isolated as crude products or if appropriate further purified, and, in a second step, these compounds are reacted with a halogenating agent at temperatures between 10@C and 150@C, if appropriate in the presence of an alkyl halide and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent. The invention furthermore relates to the new compounds of the formula (III).
