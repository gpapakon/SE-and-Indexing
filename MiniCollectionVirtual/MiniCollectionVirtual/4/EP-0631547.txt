<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
hydraulically operated disc brake systems for a trailer
or other towed vehicle; and, more particularly, to a
system including a disc brake assembly providing
efficient braking during forward movement and automatic
release upon backing.Over the years, there have been many
proposals for applying braking action to the wheels of
a trailer or other towed vehicle. Many of these
systems have utilized hydraulic braking action, similar
to standard braking systems on automotive vehicles.
However, in spite of substantial technical advances in
automotive type systems, few true advances in
technology have occurred for these trailer braking
systems. With today's highway traffic safety
regulations becoming more and more stringent, improved
braking for trailers is becoming a necessity.At the present time, the most widely used
trailer braking system is an electro-mechanical system
that is activated by the rearward force transmitted to
the tongue of the trailer when the brakes of the towing
vehicle are applied. A mechanical transducer senses 
the force along the tongue and, in turn, activates the
brake cylinders to apply hydraulic pressure to the
brake pads. The hydraulic pressure is actually
generated by a master cylinder integral with or mounted
on the trailer tongue.In order to permit backing of the trailer,
these systems that are in wide use today include an
electrical solenoid for rendering the hydraulic system
ineffective. This disabling action takes place in
response to activation of the backup lights of the
towing vehicle. Of course, because of this feature, an
electrical connection must be made between the backup
lights and the solenoid each time the trailer is
hitched to the towing vehicle.In addition to the requirement to make this
connection being inconvenient, it has been found in
practice that the electrical coupling is often damaged,
such as by inadvertent tugging on the wires, and during
the long periods of non-use, due to such factors as
weather-related corrosion of the electrical contacts.
In addition to likely malfunction of the trailer
braking system, this added electrical load and the
possibility of a short sometimes causes malfunction in
the towing vehicle's electrical system. Furthermore,
if the driver forgets to make the electrical connection
or the connection is faulty, substantial damage can be
done to the trailer upon backing when the brakes
engage. Under possible extreme conditions, the trailer
can be caused to jackknife and even overturn due to the
brakes
