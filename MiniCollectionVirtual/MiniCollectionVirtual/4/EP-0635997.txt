<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of insect control
and particularly to the use of a concentration
dependent insect toxicant that, when mixed with a suitable
insect attracting ingredient, will be carried by the food
gatherers of a group of social insects, such as a colony of
wasps, whereupon such food is carried back to the wasps' home
colony, thereby destroying it.There are two major passive methods for insect control:
traps and toxic baits. Both types must incorporate some kind
of insect attracting material in order to be effective. Food
materials are often used as the insect attracting material.
An example of a material attractive to wasps is U.S. Pat. No.
4,851,218 to Hildebrandt et al., "Method for Controlling
Insects of the Family Vespidae Utilizing Interspecific Bait".
Traps, whether of the sugar water in a bottle variety or the
flypaper variety, are only effective on individual insects.
Toxicant preparations can be formulated with different types
of pesticides. Pesticides can be used in two major ways, for
quick-kill or for so-called "delayed-kill."Quick-kill pesticides which kill shortly after contact
or ingestion, are desirable for control of populations of
insects of non-aggregating behavior. Quick-kill pesticides
are usually used as aerosol and spray insecticides which may
be dispersed or formulated in aqueous, non-aqueous or
partially aqueous systems for ease of dispensing.Pesticides which have a "delayed kill action" are most
useful for a different type of insect: the so-called social
insect. "Delayed-kill" pesticides can derive their delayed
kill action from intrinsic properties of the chemical, if the
toxic moiety of the compound itself has a delayed release.
Membrane barriers, microencapsulation, or even binding of the
pesticide to a polymer substrate, have been used as methods
for accomplishing this delayed release. "Delayed kill"
pesticides can also be of the type that are not delayed 
release, but disrupt an insect's internal system. Disruption
of certain internal systems will cause the insect to succumb
after a period of days. A different type of "delayed kill"
is obtained from a concentration dependent toxicant, which,
at higher concentrations, would provide a quick-kill and at
lower concentrations would not kill immediately. Such a
toxicant, however, has a "delayed action kill" effect as the
target insect is killed as a result of repeated consumption
of the toxicant.The social insects include such species as ants,
termites, wasps and bees. (Wasps and bees include both
social and

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling populations of social insects
selected from wasps and bees characterised by placing, in an area

accessible to and frequented by such insects, a container of an
aqueous solution of an insecticidal formulation including a

partial salt preparation of a sulfonic acid of the formula
C
x
F
2x+1
SO
3
H, where X is 4-8, the acid being partially neutralised
with a base to a pH of between 2.8 and 6.5, wherein the partial

salt preparation makes up between 0.001% and 1.5% by weight of
the formulation, wherein the base used to neutralise the sulfonic

acid is selected from the group consisting of hydroxides of
sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, aluminum

or zirconium; ammonium hydroxide; primary, secondary or tertiary
amines; primary, secondary or tertiary alkanolamines; and tetra

alkylammonium hydroxides, the formulation further including an
insect attracting ingredient mixture of between 10% and 20% corn

syrup, between 5% and 15% sucrose, between 0.5% and 5%
maltodextrine, between 1% and 10% of a protein, and between

0.001% and 0.2% of a preservative, the balance being water, and
allowing the social insects to feed therefrom, thus providing the

social insects with a concentration dependent toxicant which the
social insects will then carry back to their home colony, thus

effecting the kill of both the social insects initially feeding
upon the formulation and of those who feed upon the formulation

carried by those social insects back to the home colony.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the preparation makes
up between 0.001% and 1.0% by weight of the formulation.
A method according to any preceding claim wherein the
partial salt preparation of the aqueous solution of the

insecticidal formulation has a pH of between 4.0 and 6.5.
A method according to any one of preceding claims 1-2
wherein the partial salt preparation of the aqueous solution of

the insecticidal formulation has a pH of between 5.0 and 6.0.
A method according to any preceding claim wherein the insect 
attracting formulation further includes a gelling agent.
A method according to claim 5 wherein the insect attracting
formulation includes between 0.5% and 10% of a gelling agent.
A method according to any preceding claim wherein the
container is a reservoir with a wicking mechanism protruding

therefrom.
