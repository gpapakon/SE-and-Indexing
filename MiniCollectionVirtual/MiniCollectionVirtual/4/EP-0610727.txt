<ABSTRACT>
An optical waveguide device for use as a second 
harmonic generator includes a nonlinear optical crystalline 

substrate of KTiOPO₄ and an optical waveguide core of a 
dielectric material, such as Ta₂O₅, disposed on the 

nonlinear optical crystalline substrate. The optical 
waveguide converts a fundamental wave into a second 

harmonic wave, the second harmonic 
wave having the same polarization as the fundamental wave. The optical 

waveguide has a thickness of 190 nm or greater and a refractive index 
difference greater than 0.1. The dispersion of the guided modes is used 

for phase matching. The 
optical waveguide device also has a dielectric loaded strip 

disposed on the optical waveguide core. The dielectric 
loaded strip may be made of SiO₂ or SiO₂ doped with 

Ta₂O₅. 
Alternatively, the optical waveguide may be a ridge-t
ype 
optical waveguide, and the optical waveguide device may 

also has a cladding layer disposed on the nonlinear optical 
crystalline substrate and the optical waveguide core.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
waveguide device for use as a wavelength converter or a
second harmonic generator for converting fundamental light
into a second harmonic wave having the wavelength which is
half that of the fundamental wave, and more particularly to
an optical waveguide device for use as a light source for
applying a short-wavelength coherent light beam to an
optical disc to record information thereon at a high
recording density.Optical waves that can be guided in the optical
waveguide are limited to an intrinsic mode having discrete
propagation constants and can be distinguished by modal
orders 0, 1, 2, ... In general, nth-order intrinsic mode
has n nodes in its electric field distribution and an
intensity distribution of a far field pattern of light
emitted from the waveguide has n nodes accordingly. The
existence of nodes is very disadvantageous particularly for
devices which focus the emitted light. Therefore, it is
customary that optical waveguide devices are designed to
utilize a 0th-order waveguide light in which no nodes
exist. Wavelength converters using an optical waveguide, 
for example, are known as one of such optical waveguide
devices. In this case, the above-mentioned characteristic
imposes a large restriction on designing the devices.There have been known optical waveguide devices
for use as wavelength converters or second harmonic
generators for converting fundamental wave having a
wavelength λ into a second harmonic wave having a
wavelength λ/2. The conventional optical waveguide devices
are typically classified into three types depending on how
the phase matching condition is achieved to generate the
second harmonic wave efficiently.The optical waveguide devices in the first
category are known as optical waveguide devices of the
guided mode type. In the optical waveguide devices of the
guided mode type, phase matching is accomplished by
bringing the effective refractive index of a fundamental
guided mode and the effective refractive index of a second
harmonic guided mode into agreement with each other by
using modal dispersions. Nonlinear optical materials which
satisfy such a condition are limited, and there have been
known no optical materials that would practically achieve a
high conversion efficiency in the optical waveguide devices
of this group. Also, even when the phase-matching
condition is satisfied, a resultant second harmonic wave
becomes a high-order waveguide mode of first-order or
greater in most cases and is not suitable for being focused
in
