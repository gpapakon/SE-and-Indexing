<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the oxidation dyeing of keratinous fibres, which consists in bringing keratinous fibres, to which a composition containing oxidation dyes has been applied, into contact, in the presence of an oxidising agent, with a gas containing water vapour, the temperature of the aforementioned gas being above 75 DEG C and the contact time between the aforementioned gas and the aforementioned fibres to be dyed being less than two minutes. According to the invention, the hair is dyed uniformly over the whole of the head from the roots to the ends, irrespectively of the state of the individual hairs.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the oxidation dyeing of keratinous
fibres, characterized in that it consists in bringing

into contact, in the presence of an oxidizing agent,
keratinous fibres to which has been applied a dye

composition containing at least one oxidation dye, with
a gas containing water vapour, the temperature of the

said gas being greater than 75°C and the contact time
between the said gas and the said fibres to be dyed being

less than two minutes.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the gas is at a temperature higher than or equal to

85°C.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the gas is at a temperature between 85 and 150°C.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the gas is brought into

contact with the fibre to be dyed for a period ranging
from 0.01 second to 2 minutes.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the gas is brought into contact with the fibre to be

dyed for a period ranging from 0.1 second to 50 seconds.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the gas is brought into contact with the fibre to be

dyed for a period ranging from 1 second to 10 seconds.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the application of the gas

is repeated several times on the same fibre.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the gas exclusively

contains water vapour. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the gas contains water vapour and

at least one other compound in gas or vapour form.
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the gas contains water vapour and air.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the oxidation dyes are

chosen from oxidation bases and mixtures of oxidation
bases and couplers.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the oxidizing agent is

chosen from hydrogen peroxide, urea peroxide, alkali
metal bromates and persalts.
