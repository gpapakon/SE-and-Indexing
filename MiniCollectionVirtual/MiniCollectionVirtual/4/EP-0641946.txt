<ABSTRACT>
Driving machinery having a driving shaft (1) is 
coupled to driven machinery having a driven shaft (2) 

through a coupling arrangement (3) which permits the 
shafts to be non-aligned. To prevent persons and other 

articles touching the moving parts, there is a 
stationary safety means including a sleeve (5) having a 

concertina-like portion (5A) between a series of 
cylindrical portions (5B, 5C, 5D, 5E) of progressively 

decreasing diameter and a cylindrical portion (5H) of 
greater diameter having an internal flange (5M). 

Proceeding along the sleeve, the external diameters of 
the peaks of the ridges and the internal diameters of 

the bottoms of the troughs of the concertina-like 
portion (5A) at first progressively increase and then 

progressively decrease. At least one of the cylindrical 
portions (5B, 5C, 5D, 5E) may be cut off and the 

smallest of those remaining is clamped to a stationary 
guard tube (4) within which the driven shaft (2) 

rotates. The flange (5M) fits into a circular groove 
(16) in a collar (17) having flanges (7A) through which 

pass spigots (9) fixed to a plate (10). Clips (15) 
engage the free ends of the spigots (9). The plate (10) 

has holes (11) through which pass bolts fixing the plate 
to the driving machinery, these holes being elongate so 

that the same plate can be used with several differing 
kinds of driving machinery, having fixing bolts in 

differing places.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the coupling of a 
driven shaft to a driving shaft. It is already known to couple a driven shaft, 
for example of agricultural machinery, to a driving 
shaft, for example of a tractor, using a coupling member 
which is coupled to the driven shaft in such a way that 
it can pivot in relation thereto about two intersecting 
and mutually perpendicular axes, the coupling member 
having a socket portion which can receive one end of a 
splined driving shaft, whereby the driving and driven 
shafts are coupled together for co-rotation about their 
respective axes of rotation which may be non-aligned on 
account of the nature of the coupling between the 
coupling member and the driven shaft. It is an object of the present invention to 
reduce the risk of injury to personnel using apparatus 
in which a driven shaft is coupled by a coupling member 
to a driving shaft, the risk being on account of the possibility 
of the personnel or their clothing or articles 
held by them making contact with rotating parts. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided an assembly comprising 
driving machinery including a driving shaft, driven 
machinery including a driven shaft and a coupling 
arrangement coupling the two shafts to one another so as 
to allow their axes to be non-aligned, characterised by 
safety means which remain stationary when the shafts 
rotate and which include a cover tube within which the 
driven shaft rotates, a sleeve which is a single unitary 
body of flexible and resilient material having one end 
secured to the cover tube, at least part of the sleeve  
 
being concertina-like, a more rigid collar having one 
extremity thereof secured to the other end of the sleeve 
and having openings at an opposite extremity for fixing 
means, and a plate secured with the aid of said fixing 
means to said collar, the plate also being fixed to the 
driving machinery and for that purpose having 
through-going holes of elongate cross-section so as to 
receive fastening means at various locations both on 
said driving machinery and on differently constructed 
driving machinery. According to a second aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a kit of parts for use in 
making an assembly according to the first aspect of the 
invention, characterised in that the kit includes the 
sleeve, the collar and the plate and clamps for 
embracing the opposite ends of the sleeve and clamping 
them to the collar and the cover tube. According to a third aspect of the

An assembly comprising driving machinery 
including a driving shaft (1), driven machinery 

including a driven shaft (2) and a coupling arrangement 
(3) coupling the two shafts to one another so as to 

allow their axes to be non-aligned, characterised by 
safety means which remain stationary when the shafts 

rotate and which include a cover tube (4) within which 
the driven shaft rotates, a sleeve (5) which is a single 

unitary body of flexible and resilient material having 
one end secured to the cover tube (4), at least part of 

the sleeve (5) being concertina-like, a more rigid 
collar (7) having one extremity thereof secured to the 

other end of the sleeve (5) and having openings (8) at 
an opposite extremity for fixing means (9), and a plate 

(10) secured with the aid of said fixing means (9) to 
said collar (7), the plate (10) also being fixed to the 

driving machinery and for that purpose having 
through-going holes (11) of elongate cross-section so as 

to receive fastening means at various locations both on 
said driving machinery and on differently constructed 

driving machinery. 
A kit of parts for use in making an assembly 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the kit 

includes the sleeve (5), the collar (7) and the plate 
(10) and clamps for embracing the opposite ends of the 

sleeve (5) and clamping them to the collar (7) and the

A sleeve (5) for use in guarding a coupling 
between driving and driven shafts, characterised in that 

the sleeve is a single unitary body of flexible and 
resilient material having a concertina-like portion (5A)

cylindrical portions (5B, 5C, 5D, 5E) of progressively 
decreasing diameter leading to one end of the sleeve, at
