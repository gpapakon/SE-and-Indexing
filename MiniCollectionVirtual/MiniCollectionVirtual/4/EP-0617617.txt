<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING HISTAMINE-H2-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS AT LOW DOSAGEThis invention relates to the treatment of gastric disorders and pharmaceutical compositions for use therein. More particularly the invention relates to the local treatment of gastric disorders, especially acute gastric disorders such as acid indigestion, heartburn and gastritis, and gastric and peptic ulcer, using orally administrable pharmaceutical compositions comprising a histamine H_2-receptor antagonist contained within a drug delivery system. Compositions for use in the invention are specifically adapted to provide local delivery across the stomach wall to the H_2-receptor on the parietal cell receptor.Histamine H_2-receptor antagonists, for example cimetidine, ranitidine, nizetidine and famotidine, reduce acid secretion by acting directly on the acid-secreting parietal cell located within the gastric gland of the stomach wall.Although histamine H2-receptor antagonists are remarkably effective in the treatment of many gastric disorders, in particular peptic and gastric ulcers, there exist certain patient groups which do not respond to treatment. In addition, the time lapse between dosing and onset of action, limits the potential benefit of histamine H2-receptor antagonists in the treatment of acute, self-limiting gastric disorders.Histamine H2-receptor antagonists are of potential benefit in the self-medication of acute, self-limiting gastric disorders such as hyperacidity. However, their slow onset of action is unlikely to meet the consumer requirement for rapid relief of symptoms.Moreover, it will be appreciated that use of high dose levels in an attempt to achieve rapid relief of symptoms is not appropriate for non-prescription use. Indeed, a reduction from the standard therapeutic dose would be desirable for self-medication.Co-administration of histamine H2-receptor antagonists and other pharmaceutically active materials, including antacids, has been investigated. The rationale for co-administration with antacid is that the antacid brings about rapid relief from the symptoms of excess stomach 

 acidity by neutralisation whereas the histamine H2-receptor antagonist acts independently by inhibiting secretion of acid from the parietal cell.However, it is well known (Bodemar G. et al., Lancet, jL, 444-445, 1979; Mϊhaly G.W. et al., B.M.J., 2££, 998-9, 1982; Lin. J.H. et al., B.J. Clin. Pharmacol. 24, 551-3, 1987) that when histamine H2-receptor antagonists are co-administered with antacids, especially antacids with high

Claims
1. The use of an orally administrable pharmaceutical composition comprising a histamine H2-receptor antagonist and an antacid for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of gastric disorders, whereby the composition is optimally buffered to confer a pH substantially equal to that of the pKa of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist and promote local absorption of the H2-receptor antagonist, characterised in that the dose of histamine H2-receptor antagonist per unit dosage form is less than 25mg.
2. Use as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that the composition is optimally buffered with a buffering component which is an antacid having equilibrium pH, acid neutralising capacity and gastric residence time values which provide a pH profile with time conferring a local pH level substantially equal to that of the pKa of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist.
3. Use as claimed in claim 1 or 2 for the treatment of gastric disorders in ulcer patients.
4. Use as claimed in claim 1 or 2 for the single-dose treatment of acute gastric disorders.
5. Use as claimed in any preceding claim whereby the histamine H2- receptor antagonist is cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine.
6. Use as claimed in claim 5 whereby the histamine H2-receptor antagonist is cimetidine.
7. Use as claimed in claim 6 whereby the dose level of cimetidine is between 1 and 25mg per dosage form.
8. Use as claimed in claim 7 whereby the dose level of cimetidine is between 1 and lOmg per dosage form. 


 9. Use as claimed in any preceding claim whereby the composition is buffered with aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide-magnesium carbonate co-dried gel, magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, magnesium trisilicate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, bismuth carbonate, magnesium aluminium silicate, alkali metal salts of citric, tartaric, benzoic, sorbic or phosphoric acid, or combinations of any of the aforementioned antacids.
10. A method of treatment of gastric disorders comprising orally administering to a sufferer an effective amount of a locally acting pharmaceutical composition comprising a histamine H2-receptor antagonist and an antacid, optimally buffered such that the equilibrium pH, the acid neutralising capacity and the gastric residence time values confer a pH level substantially equal to that of the pKa of the histamine H2~receptor antagonist, whereby the dose of histamine H2-receptor antagonist per unit dosage form is less than 25mg.
11. A pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of gastric disorders comprising a histamine H2-receptor antagonist and an antacid optimally buffered such that the equiHbrium pH, the acid neutralising capacity and the gastric residence time values confer a pH level substantially equal to that of the pKa of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist, characterised in that the dose of histamine H2-receptor antagonist per unit dosage form is less than 25mg.
