<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an artificial 
protein supramolecule. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to an artificial protein supramolecule 
useful as a novel functional artificial molecular 
structure in such various areas as medicine, 
biologically compatible materials, bioelectronics and 
chemical industry. Protein molecules are attracting general attention 
as permitting formation not only of medical and 
biologically compatible materials but also artificial 
material structures having such advanced functions as 
bioelements, material segregation and material 
recognition. Searching therefor, structural control and 
application thereof are causing growth of a unique area 
of research and development known as protein 
engineering. This general attention given to protein molecules 
is based on the fact that the order and functions of 
material structures which seem to be mysterious in 
nature largely depend upon protein. Actually, there are 
innumerable kinds of protein complexes in nature. 
Protein itself displays sophisticated functions, and 
furthermore provides more complicated functions by 
forming complexes with protein of the same or a 
different kind. Hemoglobin, for example, provides 
bonding and dissociation reactions of oxygen suitable in 
vivo by combining four protein molecules having a 
molecular weight of 18,000. Ferritin stores several 
thousand iron atoms by combining 24 molecules having a  
 
molecule weight of 18,000. It is also known that many 
membrane proteins taking charge of complicated reactions 
intrinsic to a biological body form complexes (Molecular 
Biology of The Cell (2nd edition), Garland Publishing, 
Inc., NY.). A complex thus comprising protein in a structure 
having a high function, may be referred to as a protein 
supramolecule. Research on the functions and structures of these 
innumerable protein supramolecules present in nature is 
a new area of research. If it were possible to freely 
manufacture such protein complexes, on the other hand, 
there would be innumerable potential applications. 
There has however as yet been no full-scale trial to do 
so, and no case of success has as yet been reported. Under such circumstances, the present invention has 
an object to overcome restrictions in the prior art, 
artificially form an arbitrary protein molecular 
complex, and provide same as a novel artificial protein 
supramolecule. Another object of the present invention 
is to provide a method for this purpose. Namely, as means to solve the
