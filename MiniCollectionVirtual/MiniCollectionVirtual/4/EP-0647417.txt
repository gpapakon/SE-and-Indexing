<ABSTRACT>
The table top (10) has at least two angular supports (8) each with hooks (12) for hanging in openings (20) in the stands (4). The hooks are adjustable in two directions in the supports. Where the supports have two arms at right angles the hooks move in the longitudinal direction of the upright arm (9) and in the depth of this arm. The upright arm has clamping devices (16) in which the hooks are displaceably fixed. The clamping devices each have two clamping blocks.
