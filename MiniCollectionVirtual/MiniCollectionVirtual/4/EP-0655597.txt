<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and apparatus 
for drying solid material borne in a liquid. 
This process and this apparatus can, in particular, be used for 
continuously drying, preferably with agglomerating and 
sizing, and separating a solid product from a potentially 
sticky liquid feed material, optionally with a heat 
treatment, especially without encrustation of the equipment 
used. One particularly preferred application of the present 
invention is in the treatment of slurries of bauxite in 
Bayer process liquor, and slurries of Bayer process salt 
cake, which are obtained by evaporating Bayer process 
liquors to a high concentration of caustic, thereby causing 
the precipitation of the sodium salts of the organic 
impurities and of sodium carbonate present in these 
liquors. The present invention is capable of converting 
such viscous liquids or slurries into dry, free-flowing, 
non-sticky, abrasion and attrition resistant particles of 
mainly carbonates or oxides of the metallic elements 
originally present in the starting material. When solutions, slurries or moist solids are dried the 
material frequently passes through a sticky phase as the 
moisture content is reduced. This is particularly true if 
the liquid phase contains dissolved solids. The standard approach to the problems this creates is to 
back-mix some of the dried product with the fresh feed so 
that the mixture passes through the sticky phase before the 
moisture content of the fresh feed is reduced. This 
technique may suffer from the disadvantages of high solids  
 
recirculation rates, high mixer power consumption, 
encrustation and wear of the equipment, etc. We have now discovered a relatively simple apparatus and 
process for drying liquid-borne solid materials, 
particularly sticky moist solids, which largely avoids the 
difficulties mentioned above. The described apparatus and 
process are not limited to aqueous solutions, suspensions 
and slurries, but may be applied to any system in which a 
carrier liquid, such as a solvent, is at least partly 
removed from a liquid-borne solid material, such as a 
solution, and particularly those which pass through a 
transient sticky phase as the carrier liquid is 
progressively removed. However, in order to simplify the 
following description of the present invention the terms 
"drying", "moisture", etc. will be used, taking an aqueous 
slurry containing solid particles as an illustrative, but 
non-limiting example. In a particularly preferred 
embodiment the dried
