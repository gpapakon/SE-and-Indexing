<ABSTRACT>
The light receiving or back-side surface (22) of an indium antimonide (InSb) photodetector device (10) substrate (12) is cleaned to remove all native oxides of indium and antimony therefrom. A passivation layer (26) is then formed on the surface (22) of a material such as silicon dioxide, silicon suboxide and/or silicon nitride which does not react with InSb to form a structure which would have carrier traps therein and cause flashing. The device (10) is capable of detecting radiation over a continuous spectral range including the infrared, visible and ultraviolet regions.

<DESCRIPTION>
INDIUM ANTIMONIDE (InSb) PHOTODETECTOR DEVICE AND STRUCTDRE FOR INFRARED, VISIBLE AND ULTRAVIOLET RADIATIONCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of copend- ing U.S. Patent Application serial no. 07/742,248, entitled"VISIBLE AND INFRARED INDIUM ANTIMONIDE (InSb) PHOTODETEC- TOR WITH NON-FLASHING LIGHT RECEIVING SURFACE", filed Aug.8, 1991 by Ichiro Kasai et al.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an indium antimonide (InSb) photodetector device and photosensitive structure having a passivated light receiving surface which elimi¬ nates degradation of photoresponse in the infrared region due to flashing and enables the device to detect radiation in a continuous spectral range including the infrared, visible and ultraviolet regions.Description of the Related ArtBack-side illuminated InSb photodetector devices such as photodiode arrays have been conventionally used for detecting infrared light radiation in a wavelength range of approximately 1 - 5.5 micrometers. However, they have been unusable for detecting light in both the infrared and visible regions due to a "flashing" effect which is inherent in conventional back-side passivated/anti-reflec- 

tion coated InSb devices.A conventional passivation/anti-reflection coating is formed by anodization of the back-side, or light receiving surface of the photodetector device substrate as described in an article entitled "Formation and Properties of Anodic Oxide Films on Indium Antimonide", by T. Sakurai et al, Japanese Journal of Applied physics, vol. 7, no. 12, Dec. 1968, pp. 1491-1496.The anodized oxide layer is predominantly microcrys- talline ln203 and Sb203 with a high concentration of antimony located interstitially within the oxide film. The antimony ions which are located close to the oxide/InSb interface form carrier traps. The flashing is caused by hot elec¬ trons generated by photons of visible or ultraviolet light which are captured by these electron traps in the passiva¬ tion layer. The trapped electrons suppress the infrared response by recombining with photogenerated minority carriers (holes) before they are collected in the semicon¬ ductor P-N junctions of the device. The prior art approach to utilization of InSb photode- tectors for detecting infrared radiation is to provide a filter which selectively prevents light of visible and ultraviolet wavelengths from reaching the device. This, of course, renders the device inoperative for detecting visible and
