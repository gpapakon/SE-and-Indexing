<ABSTRACT>
Fastening system for the bottom (14) of a drawer, on the side walls (12) of which striplike projections (26; 24) which protrude integrally from the side walls and run in the pulling-out direction of the drawer engage over the upper and/or lower side of the drawer (14) and/or a striplike projection (28a) engages into a longitudinal groove (30) formed in that end edge (32) of the bottom which faces the side wall in each case. Provided in that region of the side walls (12) which faces the adjacent end edge (32) of the bottom (14) is in each case at least one anchoring projection which, during assembly of the drawer, penetrates into the material of the bottom (14), projects beyond the striplike projections (24; 26; 28a) at right angles to the pulling-out direction of the drawer or is offset relative to them.

<CLAIMS>
Fastening system for the bottom (14) of a drawer to its 
sides (12) in which strip-like projections (26; 24) 

extending integrally from the drawer sides and running 
in the direction in which the drawer opens overlap the 

top side and/or bottom side of the drawer bottom (14)and 
from an area of the drawer sides (12) facing the bottom 

at least one anchoring projection (34; 38) penetrating 
into the material of the bottom (14) upon the assembly 

of the drawer (10) is provided, which overlaps the 
strip-like projections (24; 26; 28) at right angles to 

the drawer-opening direction or is offset therefrom,
characterized in that
 
a strip-like projection configured as a harpoon strip 

(28) enters into a groove (30) created in the edge of 
the drawer bottom (14),
 
that the harpoon strip (28) is subdivided into a number 

of harpoon-strip sections (28a) following one another in 
the lengthwise direction, and
 
that, in the area of the gaps a rib-like projection (34) 

running transversely of the harpoon strip sections 
(28a), or a projection (38) in line with the harpoon 

strip sections, and having tooth-like anchoring 
projections (40) protruding above the dimension of the 

greatest thickness of the harpoon strip, projects from 
the drawer side as an anchoring projection penetrating 

into the material of the groove's side walls. 
Fastening system according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the transversely running rib-like projection (34) 

is sharpened knife-like at its free edge (36) remote 
from the drawer side.  

 
Fastening system according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the tooth-like anchoring projections(40) have in 

their area penetrating into the groove's side walls 
sharpened knife edges running at right angles to the 

drawer-opening direction and to the flat aides of the 
drawer side. 
Fastening system according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the anchoring projection or projections (34; 38; 

42) are each an integral part of the associated drawer 
side (12).
