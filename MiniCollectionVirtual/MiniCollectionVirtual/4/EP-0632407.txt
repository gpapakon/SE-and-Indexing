<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for
generating image data. An embodiment of the invention disclosed
hereinbelow seeks to provide such a method and apparatus which are
capable of producing realistic images representing a picture.
Embodiments of the invention are particularly (but not exclusively)
useful for video game apparatus and computer graphic applications,
especially where hardware resources are limited.In computer graphics applications, image data for representing
objects realistically are plotted in a three-dimensional or "3D" image
space by separating the object into a number of polygonal surfaces,
such as triangular or square surfaces, each of which is processed as a
unit. Image data generated for each such polygonal surface are then
stored successively in a frame memory, such as a video random access
memory (RAM), whose memory space corresponds to a display screen of a
monitor or other device which is used to produce the image of the
object from the image data stored in the frame memory.In such applications, a dedicated plotting processor normally is
provided between a central processing unit (CPU) and a frame memory in
order to enhance processing speed. When the image data are generated,
the CPU supplies a plotting command to the plotting processor for
producing a polygonal image surface such as a triangle or square (such
command being referred to hereinafter as a "plotting command"), so that
the CPU need not produce the image data and supply the same directly to
the frame memory. The plotter translates the command received from the
CPU 
and subsequently plots the polygonal image surface in the frame
memory.Figs. 1A and 1B illustrate a technique for plotting
polygonal image surfaces. In order to produce image data
representing a solid object having rectangular faces with
illustrated vertices A to G as illustrated in Fig. 1A, each
of the rectangular surface areas of the object is processed
separately. That is, in the illustrated example as shown in Fig.
1B, separate plotting commands IPa, IPb and IPc are produced by
the CPU for generating polygonal image areas Pa, Pb and Pc,
respectively. The plotting commands IPa, IPb and IPc are
illustrated schematically in Fig. 2, each of which includes
respective vertex coordinates (Ax, Ay) to (Dx, Dy), (Cx, Cy)
to (Fx, Fy), and (Bx, By) to (Gx, Gy), and a CODE
providing information concerning color and other characteristics
of the image data to be included in the polygonal surface areas
Pa, Pb and Pc.The plotting commands as
