<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording apparatus and
a recording method for attaining stable recording by use
of head characteristics. More particularly this
invention relates to a recording apparatus adapted to
exalt image quality and ejection reliability by
stabilizing the ejection behavior of a recording head
and a recording method for use with the recording
apparatus.Recording apparatuses such as printers, copying
machines, or facsimiles are constructed so as to record
an image of dot pattern on a recording material such as
paper or plastic film sheet in accordance with image
data.Recording apparatuses can be divided in terms
of the manner of recording into the ink jet type, wire
dot type, thermal type, laser beam type, etc. The
recording apparatus of the ink jet type (ink jet
recording apparatus),
is constructed to effect required recording by causing a
recording head to eject ink (recording liquid) drops via
nozzles thereof and allowing the ejected ink drops 
to land on and adhere to the recording material.In recent years, a large number of recording
apparatuses have been finding customers. These
recording apparatuses are expected to satisfy the demand
for high operational speed, high resolution, high image
quality, or low noise. As an example of the recording
apparatus which answers the demand, the ink jet
recording apparatus mentioned above may be adduced. One
version of the ink jet recording apparatus attains
recording by exerting thermal energy on the ink in the
nozzles thereby inducing the ink to effervesce (or
bubble) and utilizing the force of effervescence to
eject the ink from the recording head. For the
stabilization of the operation of ink ejection and the
stabilization of the amount of ink to be ejected which
are necessary for the accomplishment of the demand
mentioned above, it is very important to control the
temperature of the recording head and adjust the drive
means used for the ink ejection.For the conventional ink jet recording apparatus,
therefore, it has been customary to adopt the so-called
closed loop system which effects the detection of the
head temperature by means of a temperature sensor
incorporated in the recording head part or the method
which, by means of a temperature calculating system
capable of arithmetically estimating a change in the
head temperature from the magnitude of the energy 
imparted to the head, detects the head temperature and
controls the temperature of the recording head within a
desired range on the basis of the detected recording
head temperature
