<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multiplexer for a digital switch, arranged to be included in a switch network whose data flow is organised in frames containing a number of time slots, said time slots including data time slots, which shall be directed through the switch from first to second sets of terminal units (4 and 6, respectively), such as subscriber connections, trunk connections, processors, etc. The multiplexer (12, 18) is controlled by a processor (34) for controllable multiplexing, i.e. mapping, of a number of transmission links (8) from each of a corresponding number of the terminal units (4) of said first set to a transmission link (10) leading to the switch, as well as of a transmission link (14) leading from the switch to a number of transmission links (16) leading to each of a corresponding number of terminal units (6) of said second set. The mapping is performed on the data time slots. All data time slots arriving from the terminal units (4) of said first set are to be sent forward via first buffer means (20) to the switch (2) in an order which is determined by a first control memory (22) for the mapping, and all data time slots arriving from the switch (2) are to be sent forward via second buffer means (24) toward the terminal units (6) of said second set in an order which is determined by a second control memory (22) for the mapping. Said buffer means (20, 24) are implemented as fifos, one for each of the links (8 and 16, respectively) from and to the terminal units (2 and 6, respectively).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiplexer for a
digital switch, which is arranged to be included in a switch
network, the data flow of which is organized into frames
containing a number of time slots including data time slots,
which shall be connected through the switch from first to
second sets of terminal units, such as subscriber
connections, trunk connections, processors, etc., wherein
the multiplexer is controlled by a processor for
controllable multiplexing, i.e. mapping, ofa number of transmission links from each of a
corresponding number of the terminal unit of said first set
to a transmission link leading to the switch, as well as ofa transmission link leading from the switch to a number
of transmission links to each of a corresponding number of
terminal units of said second set, said mapping being
performed on the data time slots, whereinall data time slots arriving from the terminal units of
said first set are to be sent via first buffer means to the
switch in an order determined by a first mapping control
memory, andall data time slots arriving from the switch are to be
sent via second buffer means toward the terminal units of
said second set in an order which is determined by a second
mapping control memory.More particularly, the switch can be a time-space switch
of a kind described in more detail in Swedish patent
application 9103719-2. Therein it is additionally disclosed
that on the transmission links there also occur, besides the
data time slots, control time slots containing packet data
for controlling the switch.When several transmission links are mapped together it is
important that this occurs with little delay, and that time
slot integrity is retained, that is, the time slots arrive in
a correct order. A certain delay is required, however, to 
avoid risking that data is read before having been written,
since time slot integrity is then lost.Therefore, it is important that time slot integrity can
easily be checked, which is difficult if the buffers required
for the mapping function are realized with usual memories.WO 84/00836, US 4612636, US 4809166, and EP 0169551
describe the general state of the art without stating
anything which can be considered to anticipate the present
invention as it is described below.The object of the invention is to solve the above
mentioned problem which, in a multiplexer of the kind defined
by way of introduction, has been achieved according to the
invention by implementing said buffer means as fifos, one
fifo for each of said links leading from or

<CLAIMS>
A multiplexer for a digital switch, arranged to be
included in a switch network whose data flow is organized in

frames containing a number of time slots, said time slots
including data time slots, which shall be directed through

the switch (2) from first to second sets of terminal units (4
and 6, respectively), such as subscriber connections, trunk

connections, processors, etc., wherein

the multiplexer (12,18) is controlled by a processor (34)
for controllable multiplexing, i.e. mapping, of
a number of transmission links (8) from each of a
corresponding number of the terminal units (4) of said first

set to a transmission link (10) leading to the switch, as
well as of
a transmission link (14) leading from the switch to a
number of transmission links (16) to each of a corresponding

number of terminal units (6) of said second set, said mapping
being performed on the data time slots, wherein
all data time slots arriving from the terminal units (4)
of said f
irst set are to be sent forward via first buffer
means (20) to the switch (2) in an order which is determined

by a first control memory (22) for the mapping, and
all data time slots arriving from the switch (2) are to
be sent forward via second buffer means (24) toward the

terminal units (6) of said second set in an order which is
determined by a second control memory (22) for the mapping,

characterized in that said buffer means (20,24) are
implemented as fifos, one for each of the links (8 and 16,

respectively) from and to the terminal units (2 and 6,
respectively).
A multiplexer according to claim 1, characterized in
that the said fifos are of a kind implemented to be able to

produce indications for "fifo full" and "fifo empty", meaning
that the mapping is not carried through correctly, a map

control function (28) being implemented and connected for
making changes in the contents of the control memories (22,

26) at the appearance of such indications.
Multiplexer according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the map control function (28) includes functions for

checking mapping information in the control memories (22,26)
against mapping information written in a memory (35)

belonging to the processor (34), and the map control function
(28) is implemented, at appearance of disagreement, to write

correct values into the control memories.
A multiplexer according to claim 2 or 3, characterized
by frame position adjustment functions (36,38) connected for

receiving said indications and, at appearance thereof,
arranged to perform frame position adjustment locally within

the multiplexer, so as to achieve smallest possible delay of
the data flow through the multiplexer.
