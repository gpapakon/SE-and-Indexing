<DESCRIPTION>
The following invention relates to a cyclone, mainly for 
separating liquid from gas/vapour which is formed on 
pressure reduction of spent cooking liquid in connection 
with pulp production, comprising a casing, an inlet 
arrangement, a lower outlet line for liquid and an upper 
outlet line for vapour and gas, said inlet arrangement 
being connected to a supply line with a valve. The 
invention relates to a cyclone of the abovementioned type 
which is cost-effective and which can in a flexible 
manner be optimised with regard to different operating 
conditions. The invention also relates to a method for 
counteracting foam formation. Cyclones are used in the main for separating a liquid 
phase from a gas/vapour phase. In industry today, use is 
in general made of cyclones which are specially manufactured 
with regard to the operating conditions in which 
the cyclone is principally to work. This trend towards 
special manufacturing leads to a small batch size, which 
in turn gives rise to relatively high costs. Furthermore, 
cyclones known today are in most cases constructed in 
such a manner that they cannot be adapted to different 
operating conditions, at least not without a considerable 
effort, as a result of which they often, in the event of 
a change in the production process, come to be used in 
operating conditions which are not optimum. GB-A-550260 and US 3,516,551, for example, show that this 
last-mentioned problem has been known for a long time and 
that there is a number of proposals for solutions of said 
problem. Common to known solutions, however, is the fact 
that flow variations are compensated in direct connection  
 
with the inlet into the cyclone by, in the case of a 
small flow, reducing the flowthrough area in the inlet 
arrangement of the cyclone so that the inlet rate is kept 
almost constant in order to obtain an optimum separation 
and by, in the case of a large flow, doing the opposite. 
In the case of liquids with a tendency to foam, however, 
such a solution proves to have undesirable after-effects, 
since the regulation gives rise to a change in the flow 
pattern and causes a pressure drop which in turn, because 
of the vapour formation etc., leads to an uneven flow 
pattern in connection with the outflow inside the cyclone 
and is thus a cause of foam formation. Foam formation is 
very disadvantageous since it disturbs the flow conditions 
inside the cyclone and thus counteracts optimum 
operating conditions. The aim of the following invention is to produce a 
cyclone

claims, characterised in that it is provided directly 

above the lower gable (1B) with an essentially 
horizontally arranged plate (8), preferably circular, a

claims, characterised in that the external diameter of the 

cyclone exceeds 1 m and is preferably between 1.5 and 
2.5 m, and in that its height expediently exceeds its 

diameter and is preferably between 1.5 and 2 times the 
diameter, and also preferably in that the diameter of each 

outlet line exceeds 0.3 m.
