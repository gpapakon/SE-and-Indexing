<ABSTRACT>
A conduit assembly having a retainer with a ring and two pairs of arms (64, 66, 76, 78). Both pairs of arms include shoulder-like portions (70, 98) which help to retain the seal means within the housing, help to retain the conduit within the housing and help to retain the retaining member within the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
 QUICK CONNECTOR WITH ONE-PIECE RETAINERCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Serial No. 465,773, filed January 1 , 1990, entitled "Snap and Lock Quick Connector" by Bartholomew which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention.BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a connector assembly which provides a snap and lock quick connection and which utilizes a one-piece retaining member. The one-piece retaining member helps to prevent the blow out of the O-rings and bushings. In the automotive industry, as well as many other industries, there is a great need for low cost, reliable and easy to assemble components. This need is especially apparent with respect to providing a connection between fluid-carrying conduits, such as fuel or refrigerant lines. In older threaded connectors, substantial assembly time could be accumulated in screwing on a cap to a fitting and tightening the cap down to the proper torque needed to provide a fluid-tight seal. Further, an inventory would have to be maintained to keep track of the number of caps and fittings, and any liners or other components that may be necessary. Also, retightening of the caps may be required to maintain the seal after the automobile or other system has been put in use.It is also desired in the case where the retaining member is pre-installed in the female to have the retaining member formed such that it is spread open by the male upon insertion. The retaining member accommodates tolerances of the male and permits movement of the male without seriously affecting the abutting function, because of the separated spring portion of the retaining member.It is also desirable to have a one-piece retaining member which has a means for receiving and retaining a bushing between a male member and the interior of a female member, since a bushing not retained between a male member and female member tends to be expelled by the action of confined pressure.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved connector assembly which utilizes a one-piece retaining member for providing a quick connection between fluid conveying conduits.Another object of the present invention is to provide a preassembled connector housing and one-piece retaining member so that a connection to a tubular fluid conveying conduit may be made in one step without resorting to any tools. 

 Another object of the present invention is to provide a pre-assembled connector housing and

WE CLAIM:
1. A quick connector assembly comprising: a conduit having a radially outward extending annular flange at a predetermined distance from an end of said conduit; a housing having an axial bore formed therein for receiving said conduit; seal means for sealing said conduit with said housing, said seal means positioned in said axial bore of said housing; and retainer means for retaining said conduit in said housing, said retainer means positioned in said housing axial bore and including a ring means for maintaining said sealing means in said housing, and a first pair of arms extending from said ring means, and a second pair of arms extending from said ring means, said ring means including an axial bore enabling passage of said conduit, and said second pair of arms alternating between said first pair of arms.
2. The quick connector assembly according to claim 1 wherein said retainer means further comprises a one-piece retainer for maintaining said sealing means in said housing and for maintaining said conduit in said housing.
3. The quick connector assembly according to claim 1 wherein said first pair of arms extend from said ring, said arms being formed by a pair of strips, said strips being connected by a leg portion having an outwardly extending flange.
4. A quick connector assembly according to claim 1 wherein said second pair of arms extend from said ring means, said second pair of arms having an overall planar shape and an abutting means.
5. The quick connector assembly according to claim 3 wherein said arms include a conduit abutting means.
6. The quick connector assembly according to claim 5 wherein said conduit abutting means is a shoulder-like portion having a shape with a leading edge for abutting said annular flange to retain said conduit in said housing and an opposing edge for abutting said housing to retain said retainer in said housing. 


 7. The quick connector assembly according to claim 4, wherein said abutting means is a shoulder-like portion having a shape for retaining the seal means within said housing.
8. The quick connector assembly according to claim 1 wherein at least one pair of said arms does not project outside said housing.
9. A quick connector assembly comprising: a conduit having a radially outward extending annular flange at a predetermined distance from an end of said conduit; a housing having an axial bore formed therein for receiving said conduit; seal means for sealing said conduit with said housing, said seal means positioned in said axial bore of said housing; and a retainer means for retaining said conduit in said housing, said retainer means positioned in said housing axial bore, said retainer means including a ring means for maintaining said sealing means in said housing, said ring means including an axial bore for enabling passage of said conduit; a first pair of arms extending from said ring means, said first pair of arms extending from said ring means said arms being formed by a pair of strips, said strips being connected by a leg portion having an outwardly extending flange, said arms also having a conduit abutting means; a second pair of arms extending from said ring means, said second pair of arms having an overall planar shape, and an abutting means; and said first pair of arms alternating between said second pair of arms.
