<ABSTRACT>
A pressure regulating valve (10) is proposed, having a valve housing (11) and a valve element (30) therein, which is loaded by a control spring (15) in the direction of a valve seat (31) and serves for the regulation of a medium, especially a liquid, under pressure, the valve element (30) having a ball (33) which carries a valve seat surface (34) assigned to the valve seat (31) and a holding part (32) carrying the ball (33). The ball (33) is clipped, in a manner safe against loss, into a ball recess (41) thus formed integrally in the holding part (32) and is held in the ball recess (41) so as to be pivotably movable. By this means, the number of the components is reduced and assembly is simplified.
