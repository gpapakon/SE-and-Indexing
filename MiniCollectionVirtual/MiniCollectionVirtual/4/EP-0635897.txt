<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric filter comprising a rectangular 
parallelepipedic dielectric ceramic block provided with a pair of 

resonance holes vertically bored therethrough, a conductive layer 
formed on the entire surface of the ceramic block except the top 

side of the block, a pair of input and output terminals arranged on 
a lateral side of the ceramic block and, additionally, coupling 

capacitance regulating or trimming electrodes arranged on the top of 
the ceramic block, each of said trimming electrodes extending from 

one of said input and output terminals to the vicinity of the 
opening of the corresponding resonance hole on the top side so that 

the coupling capacitance of the gap separating the input/output 
terminal and the resonance hole can be regulated by appropriately 

trimming the trimming electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric filter to be
suitably used for a telecommunication apparatus such as a portable
telephone set or a mobile telephone set and, more particularly, it
relates to a dielectric filter capable of finely regulating its
input coupling capacitance and output coupling capacitance.Normally a capacitance coupling is realized among a pair of
terminals for input and output purposes, a first resonance hole
arranged close to the terminals and a last resonance hole remote
from the terminals in conventional dielectric filters as typically
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 3-40962.Fig. 1 shows such a conventional dielectric filter
comprising a dielectric block a which has an upper surface b where
the ceramic material of the block is exposed and a front surface
provided with an input and output terminals c and c. The dielectric
block a is provided with a pair of resonance holes d and d which are
extended between the upper surface b and the bottom surface
thereof. On the upper surface b of the dielectric block a are
provided a pair of recessed electrodes e and e extending from the
respective input and output terminals c and c and a pair of jutted
electrodes f and f extending from respective ends of the resonance
holes d and d. The jutted portion of each jutted electrode f is
extended into the recessed portion of the corresponding recessed
electrode e so that gaps g and g are formed between the jutted
electrodes and the respective recessed electrodes to produce a 
desired input and a desired output coupling
capacitance.A conventional dielectric filter having a
configuration as described above is disadvantageous in
that the jutted electrodes f and f and the recessed
electrodes e and e have, by definition, a complicated
profile having a number of lines such that the jutted
portion of each of the electrodes f and f is received
by the recessed portion of the corresponding electrode
e. Therefore, it is practically impossible to
regulate the capacitance of the filter once the jutted
and recessed electrodes are formed and hence to
achieve an optimum input and an optimum output
coupling capacitance for the filter.JP-A-57-73501 shows a dielectric filter having
those features set out in the precharacterising
portion of claim 1.It is, therefore, an object of the present
invention to provide a dielectric filter that is free
from the above identified disadvantage.According to the invention, there is provided a
dielectric filter as set out in claim 1. Preferably, each of the trimming
