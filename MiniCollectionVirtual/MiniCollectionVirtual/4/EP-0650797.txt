<ABSTRACT>
A method for separating a temperature-adhered 
electrode tip from a workpiece (6) wherein the electrode tip 

(3) is biased in a direction away from the workpiece (6) and 
a separation force is imposed on the electrode tip (3) while 

the biasing force is being imposed so that a defect is not 
caused in the workpiece (6) when the electrode tip (3) or 

the workpiece (6) is moved relative to the other during 
and/or after separation. An apparatus wherein a condenser 

battery (45) is disposed in an electrical circuit including 
a welding gun servo motor (26). An apparatus wherein an 

electrode tip rotating device (30) is installed in the 
welding gun (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for separating a welding electrode tip from a 
workpiece when the electrode tip has temperature adhered to 
the workpiece. Automobile body panels are spot welded using a 
welding apparatus which includes a general purpose robot 
having six degrees of freedom and a spot-welding gun coupled 
to a wrist portion of the robot. The conventional 
spot-welding gun pressurizes a workpiece between a pair of 
electrode tips by reciprocally moving one of the electrode 
tips by an air cylinder. By comparison, a servo-welding gun 
having a pair of electrode tips, one of which is driven by a 
servo motor, was proposed by the present applicant in 
Japanese Patent Application No. 4-94916 filed on March 23, 
1992. When temperature adhesion has occurred between an 
electrode tip and a workpiece, a worker after recognizing 
the temperature adhesion enters the welding area to hammer 
the adhering portion of the electrode tip free from the 
workpiece. In the case of a welding gun operated by an air 
cylinder, remaining air pressure continues to bias the  
 
electrode tip in a direction away from the workpiece. 
Consequently, the workpiece will not be injured when the 
hammered electrode tip is forced to move relative to the 
workpiece. In the case of a servo-welding gun, however, the 
servo-welding gun and a robot are automatically powered off 
when the worker enters the welding area. Therefore, no 
biasing force acts on the electrode tip in a direction away 
from the workpiece, and the electrode tip continues to contact 
the workpiece. Consequently, the workpiece will be injured 
when the hammered electrode tip is moved laterally relative to 
the workpiece. DE-A-3,047,913 discloses a device for signalling the 
presence of a temperature-adhering welding electrode tip on a 
workpiece, and the necessity to separate the workpiece from 
the electrode tip. An object of the present invention is to provide a method 
and apparatus for separating a temperature-adhered electrode 
tip of a servo-welding gun from a workpiece without causing a 
defect to the workpiece when electrode tip and the workpiece 
are moved relative to each other. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
method and apparatus for automatically separating an electrode 
tip of a servo-welding gun from a workpiece when a 
temperature-adhered electrode tip has been detected. The invention provides a method for separating a 
temperature-adhered welding electrode tip from a workpiece in 
accordance
