<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an apparatus for 
altering an electrical signal between a first device and 

a second device. The apparatus includes a support 
structure or interconnection member having at least two 

surfaces with a plurality of contacts on each surface. 
The contacts are arranged in a predesignated pattern to 

mate with the conductors of each of the devices. In a 
typical application, the apparatus will be used to 

connect a microprocessor powered by approximately 3.3V to 
a printed circuit board of a system using a power supply 

of approximately 5.0V.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
modifying an electrical signal passing between first and
second devices, and particularly to an apparatus for
regulating a voltage signal between two electrical
components, such as a microprocessor and a printed
circuit board to which the microprocessor is mounted.
The printed circuit board could, for example, be situated
in a device such as a computer.In the electronics industry, and particularly
in the computer industry, electrical signals are often
transmitted between devices or components at a
multiplicity of contact points. One example is a
microprocessor having a large number of contact pins
connected to corresponding contacts on, for instance, a
printed circuit board within a computer. Typically, the
microprocessor will have a pin grid array appropriately
configured for mating engagement with corresponding
contacts arranged in some type of socket or receptacle.Generally, standard voltages are used to power
various electrical components, such as microprocessors.
For example, computers generally use a supply voltage of
approximately 5.0V to power various digital hardware
devices. In certain applications, this can be
problematic because heat is generated when current is
supplied at 5.0V. As electrical devices are continually
downsized, such heat generation becomes a greater 
problem. In certain applications, microprocessors must
be packaged in ceramic pin grid array packages which can
withstand the heat. Cheaper plastic packages may melt or
be otherwise damaged by excess heat. Ceramic packaging
is more expensive to manufacture than plastic packaging,
leading to increased cost of the finished product.Certain electrical components are presently
available which can be powered by 3.3V, which creates
substantially less heat than higher (e.g., 5.0V) supply
voltages. For example, certain microprocessor chips,
such as the Am 486™ 3.3V manufactured by Advanced Micro
Devices, can be powered by 3.3V and are available in
plastic packages called plastic quad flat packages. The
Am 486™ 3.3V microprocessor chip is specially designed to
allow the core microprocessor to operate at 3.3V while
providing compatible external signals of approximately
5.0V. This allows the chip to function on about one-half
the power of a conventional 5.0V chip. Such chips or
devices are also beneficial since the plastic quad flat
package is a much narrower package than the conventional
ceramic package. This is particularly advantageous when
space is limited.One problem, of course, is that many
