<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compensating 
phase errors in electromagnetic receiving systems, 
more specifically it relates to compensating for 
errors that result from differing electrical path 
lengths in electromagnetic receiving systems having a 
multi-element antenna. In receiving systems that are used to measure a 
bearing angle of an intruder, it is important to 
maintain an accurate phase relationship between the 
signals from the different elements of the antenna Phase errors are introduced into these systems 
by differences in electrical path lengths between the 
antenna elements and other parts of the receiver 
system. In the past, this problem was addressed by 
calibrating the antenna system after it has been 
installed on an aircraft; this approach added to the 
expense and complexity of the installation process. 
The problem was also addressed by connecting the 
antenna elements to the receiver using cables or 
conductors that have a precisely controlled length. 
Using precision length cables or conductors proved to 
be expensive and in convenient. In addition to being 
expensive, the precision length cables or conductors 
required using specialized test equipment to verify 
cable length.  
 In regard to the prior art, U.K. patent publication 
GB-2171849A and U.S. Patent US-5,027,127 appear to be 
relevant. The U.K. patent publication relates to the 
alignment of phased array antenna systems. In order 
to align or calibrate all the antenna elements 22 of 
a phased array, that is, to provide for one 
particular direction equal amplitude and phase for 
all the individual output signals, two stages of 
alignment are involved. First, one antenna is 
established as a reference, and then, taking each of 
the others in turn and making a one-to-one comparison 
with the reference, gain command values at G2, G3, 
etc. are established which give equal outputs to the 
reference antenna. These values are recorded. 
Secondly, again considering one antenna as a standard 
and working to the same constant output signal, 
phase command values P2, P3, P4, etc. are established 
to give phases which are each exactly in antiphase to 
the phase for the reference value Pa. The 
calibration results may be stored in a computer 
memory. The U.S. Patent relates to phase alignment of 
electronically scanned antenna arrays. According to 
the invention, a loosely coupled, constant-amplitude, 
linear phase traveling-feed, also known as a BITE 
("Built-In Test Equipment") coupler system, is 
attached to the rear of a
