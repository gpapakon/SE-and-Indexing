<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the subjects of
EP-A-524 624 and EP-A-512 554.The present invention relates to a
process for preparing a metallocene composition.
The present invention also relates to organic compounds
suitable for making metallocenes.Since the discovery of ferrocene in 1951, a number of
metallocenes have been prepared by the combination of anions having the 
cyclopentadienyl structure with various transition metals. The term
"cyclopentadienyl structure" as used herein refers to the following
structure.

Such "cyclopentadienyl structure" can be formed by addition of various
metal alkyls to cyclopentadiene and "cyclopentadiene-type" compounds.The term "cyclopentadiene-type compound" as used herein refers
to compounds containing the cyclopentadiene structure. Examples of
cyclopentadiene-type compounds include unsubstituted cyclopentadiene,
unsubstituted indene, unsubstituted tetrahydroindene, unsubstituted
fluorene, and substituted varieties of such compounds.Many of the cyclopentadiene-type metallocenes have been found
useful in catalyst systems for the polymerization of olefins. It has
been noted in the art that variations in the chemical structure of such
cyclopentadienyl-type metallocenes can have significant effects upon the
suitability of the metallocene as a polymerization catalyst. For
example, the size and substitutions on cyclopentadienyl-type ligands have
been found to affect the activity of the catalyst, the stereoselectivity
of the catalyst, the stability of the catalyst, and other properties of
the resulting polymer; however, the effects of various substituents is
still largely an empirical matter, that is, experiments must be
conducted in order to determine just what effect a particular variation
will have upon a particular type of cyclopentadienyl-type metallocene.
Some examples of some cyclopentadienyl-type metallocenes are disclosed 
in U.S. patent Nos. 4,530,914; 4,808,561; and 4,892,851.In the past most polymerization work has been done using
homogeneous, i.e. soluble, metallocenes rather than heterogenous systems
in which the metallocene is insoluble during the polymerization.
However, for many industrial applications it would be desirable to have
insoluble supported forms of metallocenes that are still active as
polymerization catalysts.It is also envisioned that such heterogeneous catalysts would
have other uses. For example, the compositions could possibly be used
as catalysts for hydrogenation, alkene epoxidation, alkene
isomerization, ketone reduction,
