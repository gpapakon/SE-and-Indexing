<CLAIMS>
Wall or furniture covering, in particular wall tapestry, with a carrier 
(3,6,9,) in particular of paper and with pieces of film having thermoplastic 

characteristics arranged regularly or irregularly on it and being connected to the 
carrier (3,6,9) by the action of temperature and pressure in such a way that the 

surface of the covering is given a three-dimensional structure in the form of 
raised portions (2,7,10). 
Wallcovering according to claim 1, characterised in that the pieces of film 
(4) have a size of about 1 to 10mm in length and width. 
Wallcovering according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the pieces of 
film (4) cover the carrier (3,6,9) over part of its area or all of its area. 
Wallcovering according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in 
that the pieces of film (4) are arranged on the carrier (3,6,9) as one layer or in a 

number of layers. 
Wallcovering according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in 
that the pieces of film (4) comprise plastics, in particular polyethylene. 
Wallcovering according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in 
that the pieces of film (4) originate from scrap plastics film. 
Wallcovering according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in 
that the pieces of film (4) are present in a three-dimensionally shaped form.  

 
Wallcovering according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the pieces of 
film (4) originate from a material provide
d at least on one side with a 
thermoplastic coating and containing a layer of aluminium foil. 
Wallcovering according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in 
that the coloured pattern on the wallcovering is provided by pieces of film (4) of 

different colours. 
Wallcovering according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in 
that on the side having the pieces of film (4) there is arranged a thin paper layer 

(5) having raised portions (7) and connected with the carrier either over its full 
area or part of its area. 
Wallcovering according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in 
that on the side having the pieces of film (4) there is arranged a thin layer of a 

coloured material (5) connected at least to the raised portions. 
Wallcovering according to claim 10 or 11, characterised in that the thin 
layer (5) comprises shredded paper, in particular shredded scrap paper. 
Process for manufacturing a wall or furniture covering, in particular a 
wall tapestry, according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in that 

pieces of film (4) having thermoplastic characteristics are deposited on a carrier 
(3,6,9) in particular paper, in a regular or irregular arrangement and compressed 

by the action of heat and pressure and are connected to the carrier (3,6,9) by 
stamping to form a three-dimensional structure.  

 
Process according to claim 13, characterised in that the pieces of film (4) 
are connected to the carrier (3,6,9) under low pressure, e.g. by means of rollers, 

brushes or the like under the action of heat. 
Process according to claim 13, characterised in that the pieces of film (4) 
are connected to the carrier (3,6,9) under high pressure with simultaneous 

stamping of the structure. 
Process according to claim 15, characterised in that the pieces of film (4) 
are stamped onto the carrier (3,6,9) by stamping rollers, perforated rollers, 

stamping plates or a calender roller. 
Process according to one of claims 13 to 16, characterised in that the 
pieces of film (4) are coated onto the carrier (3,6,9) in accordance with the 

subsequent stamping e.g. by means of a perforated roller.
