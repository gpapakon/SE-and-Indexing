<ABSTRACT>
On a network, access to individual data processing systems 
is remotely controlled from a host data processing system. 

A security request is provided at the host data processing 
system. The security request specifies the target data 

processing systems, whether those systems are to be locked 
or unlocked, the peripherals of the specified data processing 

systems that are affected and a password. The 
security request is communicated to all data processing 

systems in communication with the host data processing 
system. Each data processing system processes the security 

request to determine if it is a target. If so, then a 
lock status of a target set of data processing systems is 

changed in response to the security request. The change in 
lock status of the target set of data processing systems 

either facilitates or prohibits use of the target set of 
data processing systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatuses for
securing computers and their components on a data processing
system network.It is frequently desirable to secure a large number of
networked computers in order to prevent unauthorized access to
both the individual computers and to the network. Current
methods of securing computers involve either physically
locating the computers in a secured area or individually
locking each computer at the site of the computer. Reliance on
the former method may be impractical. For example, a network
may have workstations in several buildings scattered over many
areas. Each building could have several floors, with each
floor containing dozens of personal computers. The latter
method relies on the individual users to lock their computers.
In the prior art, there exists various devices and methods for
a user to secure a computer through its keyboard. However, a
user may forget to secure the user's respective computer.Thus, there is a need for a convenient method for securing a
number of networked computers. Furthermore, there is a need to
secure a single computer from a remote location. This is
because many facilities with computer networks have a central
security location, which may be remote from the computers.European Patent Application EP-A-0 421 409 (IBM Corporation)
entitled "Transaction System Security Method" discloses an 
improved security system which uses especially an IC card to
enhance the security functions involving component
authentication, user verification, user authorization and
access control, protection of message secrecy and integrity,
management of cryptographic keys, and auditablity. Both the
security method and the apparatus for embodying these
functions across a total system or network using a common
cryptographic architecture are disclosed. Authorization to
perform these functions in the various security component
device nodes in the network can be distributed to the various
nodes at which they will be executed in order to personalize
the use of the components.Patent abstract of Japan vol. 14, no. 468 (p-1115) 12 October
1990 & JP-A-02 186 429 (Hitachi) 20 July 1990 entitled
"Network Type Printing System" discloses a system to hold the
secrecy of a printed document by key locking a tray designated
with a host, and unlocking it based on an ID code transmitted
by the host. Document data, whose printing is required, are
sent through a data transmission path to a print controller.
The controller generates the printing dot data based on

<CLAIMS>
A method of remotely securing a network (11) of plural data
processing systems (13) , with each data processing system

(13) comprising one or more lockable elements, said plural
data processing systems being connected to a host data

processing system (25) by said network (11), characterized in
that said method comprises the steps of:


a) providing each of said elements of each of said data
processing systems (13) in said network with a lock status,

wherein said lock status may be changed between an unlocked
condition and a locked condition, wherein each of said

elements having said lock status in said unlocked condition
is accessible for use and each of said elements having said

lock status in said locked condition is inaccessible for use;
b) at said host data processing system (25), accepting (55) a
security request targeted at a target set of said data

processing systems (13), said security request being an
instruction to change said lock status of at least one of said

elements of each of said data processing systems in said
target set of said data processing systems (13);
c) communicating (57) said security request from said host
data processing system (25) to all of said interconnected data

processing systems (13) on said network (11);
d) recognizing (63) said security request at said target set
of said data processing systems (13); and
e) changing (81, 69) said lock status of at least one of
said elements of each of said data processing systems in said

target set of said data processing systems in response to said
recognized security request.
The method of claim 1, wherein said step of accepting (55)
a security request further comprises the step of accepting an

instruction to place said lock status of at least one of said
elements of each of said data processing systems (13) in said

target set of said data processing systems in said locked
condition to prevent access to said target data processing
