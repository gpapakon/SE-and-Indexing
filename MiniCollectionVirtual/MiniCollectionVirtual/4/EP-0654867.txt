<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector
assembly of the preamble to claim 1 and, particularly, to a
hybrid electrical connector for accommodating both high
frequency transmission as well as lower frequency
transmissions.Electrical connectors are used to interconnect signal
transmission lines to printed circuit boards, other
electronic devices or to other complementary connectors. The
transmission lines transmit signals through a plurality of
conductors which, preferably, are physically separated and
electromagnetically isolated along their length.In the electronics industry, particularly the computer
industry, the predominant system embodies a plurality of
plug-in type connectors in mating engagement with receptacle
connectors on the computer, its main printed circuit board
or other electronic devices. The transmission lines
typically include coaxial electrical cables, either in round
or flat form, and round cables are presently being used
predominantly in relatively high frequency applications
between various system components.Classical coaxial designs derive their characteristic
impedance from the geometrical relationship between the
inner signal conductors and the outer shield member and the
intervening dielectric constant. For a given impedance,
signal conductor size and dielectric material, an overall
outside dimension is defined. In order to increase signal
density and reduce the overall outside dimensions of a
transmission line connector system, alternate geometries
and/or dielectric materials are required. For data
processing purposes, cables usually utilize twisted pairs of
conductors to achieve the necessary characteristics, 
particularly impedance control and cross talk control.
Coaxial cables are used in singular conductor configurations
in high frequency applications, such as to a high-speed
video monitor. Most often, the lower speed data transmission
lines are separated from the high speed signal transmission
lines. Consequently, different electrical connectors are
often used for the lower speed data transmission lines than
for the high speed signal lines. This adds to the problem of
requiring multiple connectors in ever-increasing
miniaturized and high density application.An electrical connector assembly according to the
preamble of claim 1 is already known from FR-A-1,107,754 =
US-A-2,804,601, which shows sleeve-like coupling devices for
electric cables for use with a television camera. A
plurality of conductor wires is symmetrically arranged
around the sleeve axis and forms an
