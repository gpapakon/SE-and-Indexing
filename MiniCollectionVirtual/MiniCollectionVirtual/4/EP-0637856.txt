electrical conductor (21); an insulating sleeve (24) which 
is fitted around the electrical conductor (21) and the ring

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
joint construction for an ignition system and more particularly, 
to a joint construction between a rodlike high-voltage 
terminal provided at a distal end of an ignition 
coil or an ignition cable of an internal combustion engine 
and a tubular electrical conductor, in which the high-voltage 
terminal is connected to a spark plug through the 
electrical conductor. Documents US-A-3 246 284 and WO-A-9 208 259 
disclose two examples of point constructions for ignition 
systems according to the prior art. Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication No. 
64-8580 (1989) discloses an ignition system for connecting 
an ignition coil and a spark plug through an electrical 
conductor as shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, an insulator 4 is 
mounted in a hole 3 formed on a cylinder head 2 of an 
engine 1 and an electrical conductor 5 is fitted into a 
bore of the insulator 4. A terminal 6 provided at an upper 
portion of the electrical conductor 5 is urged by a spring 
7 so as to be brought into contact with a high-voltage 
terminal 9 of an ignition coil 8 inserted into inserted 
into an upper portion of the insulator 4. Meanwhile, a 
terminal 10 provided at a lower portion of the electrical 
conductor 5 is urged by a spring 11 so as to be brought 
into contact with a terminal 13 of a spark plug 12 inserted 
into a lower portion of the insulator 4. In this known ignition system, since electrical 
sealing property between the spark plug 12 and the insulator  
 
4 is required to be upgraded in response to rise of 
required voltage, the bore of the insulator 4 is reduced in 
diameter so as to powerfully clamp an insulator portion 12a 
of the spark plug 12. However, in the known ignition system, the ignition 
coil 8 and the electrical conductor 5 are adapted to 
be separated from each other functionally. Therefore, if 
the ignition coil 8 is lifted upwardly with a hand when the 
ignition system is removed from the engine 1, large clamping 
force applied to the spark plug 12 by the insulator 4 
removes the ignition coil 8 from the insulator 4 before the 
insulator 4 is separated from the spark plug 12. As a 
result, the insulator 4, the electrical conductor 5, etc. 
remain in the hole 3 of the engine 1 undesirably. In order to eliminate this drawback, it may be 
considered that the ignition coil 8 is clamped by the 
insulator 4 more powerfully. However, in this case, since 
force for inserting the ignition coil 8 into the insulator 
4 is also increased, such an inconvenience is

A joint construction between a rodlike high-voltage terminal (19) provided 
at a distal end of an ignition coil (18) or an ignition cable and a tubular 

electrical conductor (21) in an ignition system, in which the high voltage terminal 
(19) is fitted into the electrical conductor (21) so as to be connected to 

a spark plug (17) through the electrical conductor (21), and an insulating 
sleeve (24) is fitted around the electrical
 conductor (21), 
characterized
 in 
that: 


the high-voltage terminal (19) is formed, on its outer periphery, with a 
recess (19a); 
the electrical conductor (21) is formed with a through-hole (21a) confronting 
the recess (19a); 
a ring (22) having a boss (22a) is fitted around the electrical conductor 
(21) such that the boss (22a) is brought into engagement with the recess 

(19a) of the high-voltage terminal (19) via the thorough-hole (21a) of the 
electrical conductor (21); 
the insulating sleeve (24) fitted around the electrical conductor (21) and 
the ring (22) has such an inside diameter that the ring (22) is restricted by 

the inner periphery of the sleeve and thus the boss (22a) is prevented from 
being brought out of engagement with the recess (19a); 
and the insulating sleeve (24) is detachably locked to the ignition coil 
(18) or the ignition cable by a locking member (25; 24b, 18c). 
A joint construction as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein the locking member (25; 24b, 18c) includes an 

insulating cap (25) having first and second locking portions 
(25a, 25b), while the ignition coil (18) or the 

ignition cable has a first mating locking portion (18b) and 
the insulating sleeve (24) has a second mating locking 

portion (24a),
 
   wherein the insulating cap (25) is mounted on the 

ignition coil (18) or the ignition cable and the insulating 
sleeve (24) such that the first and second locking portions 

(25a, 25b) are brought into engagement with the first and 
second mating locking portions (18b, 24a), respectively. 
A joint construction as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein the locking member (25; 24b, 18c) includes a

further comprising:  

 

a retainer (27) which is slidably fitted into the 
electrical conductor (21) and is brought into contact with 

the boss (22a) of the ring (22) so as to radially expand 
the ring (22) such that the ring (22) is held in a state 

where the ring (22) projects out of the insulating sleeve 
(24) through contact of an end face (22b) of the ring (22) 

with an end face (24a) of the insulating sleeve (24); 
wherein when the high-voltage terminal (19) is 
depressed, together with the retainer (27), into the electrical 

conductor (21) in said state of the ring (22), the 
retainer (27) regulates the ring (22) to such a position 

that until the boss (22a) of the ring (22) is brought into 
engagement with the recess (19a) of the high-voltage terminal 

(19), the boss (22a) of the ring (22) does not interfere

been brought into engagement with the recess (19a) of the 

high-voltage terminal (19), the retainer (27) is disengaged 
from the boss (22a) of the ring (22) so as to set the ring 

(22) to such a dimension that the ring (22) can be fitted 
into the insulating sleeve (24). 
A joint construction as claimed in Claim 5, 
further comprising:
 
   a stopper (21b) for positioning and holding the 

retainer (27) disengaged from the boss (22a) of the ring  
 

(22), which is provided on an inner periphery of the electrical 
conductor (21). 
A joint construction as claimed in Claim 5, 
further comprising:

from the end face (24a) of the insulating sleeve (24), 

which are, respectively, formed on an outer periphery of 
the electrical conductor (21) and an inner periphery of the 

insulating sleeve (24) so as to not only regulate further 
projection of the electrical conductor (21) from the 

insulating sleeve (24) but allow displacement of the 
electrical conductor (21) relative to the insulating sleeve 

(24) in a direction opposite to that of projection of the 
electrical conductor (21) from the insulating sleeve (24). 
A joint construction as claimed in Claim 6, 
further comprising:
 
   an engageable portion (30) and a mating 

engageable portion (31) engageable with the engageable
