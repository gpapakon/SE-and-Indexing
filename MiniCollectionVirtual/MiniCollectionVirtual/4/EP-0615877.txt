<ABSTRACT>
In order to prevent torsional vibrations of the vehicle body, the drive assembly is used as absorber, which is held in a special way in the vehicle body by means of three bearings (4, 5, 6), the bearings having a characteristic with low vertical bearing rigidity, determining a high natural frequency of the assembly roll mode and precisely matched to the body torsion.

<CLAIMS>
A motor vehicle with a bodywork, in particular a convertible bodywork, which is subjected 
to torsional and flexural vibratio
ns and on which a drive unit is suspended by 
way of resilient bearings so as to act as a damper mass, wherein the drive unit is held 

between longitudinal and transverse supports of the bodywork by way of three resilient 
bearings, 
characterized in that
 one engine bearing situated in front with respect to the 
direction of travel (
F
) is arranged in the low-vibration region (
A
) of the bodywork in 
the rolling axis (7) of the unit and the two transmission bearings (5, 6) at the rear with a 

base (
b
) are held on rigid members (30) of the vehicle body in a transverse plane (
Z-Z
) 
and outside the rolling axis (7) in a region (
B
) of the bodywork with maximum torsional-vibration 
amplitudes, and the two transmission bearings (5, 6) have a characteristic 

of the vertical bearing rigidity determining [a] high natural frequency of the rolling 

behaviour of the unit and adapted precisely to the torsion of the bodywork so as to produce 
a drive unit (1) oscillating freely about the rolling axis (7) as a damper, and the 

three bearings (4, 5 and 6) are arranged in an oblique plane (
X-X
) ascending towards 
the rear with respect to the direction of travel (
F
) and arranged at an angle (
Î±
) and 
extending through the overall centre of gravity (
S
). 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the resilient bearings (4, 
5 and 6) have a greater degree of rigidity in the vertical direction (15) than in the longitudinal 

direction (16), and have a substantially equal degree of rigidity in the transverse 
direction (17) as in the vertical direction (15). 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the engine bearing 
(4) is held in a transverse support (8) supported on the vehicle body, wherein the transmission 

bearings (5, 6) are mounted in a respective transversely arranged bracket (12, 
13) connected to the transmission housing (14). 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the brackets (12, 13) 
comprise vertically orientated spring leaves constructed so as to be rigid about the 

rolling axis (7) of the unit in the vertical direction and deflexible to a limited extent in 
the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that
 the brackets (12, 13) 
are connected to the transmission housing (14) by way of bolts (19) arranged in sleeves  

 
(21) partly surrounded on the bracket (12, 13) by a convexly shaped portion (20) and 

secured therein.
