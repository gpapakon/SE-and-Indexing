<ABSTRACT>
A multiple-task controller includes a plurality of 
tasks which are controlled with first and second external 

devices: task memory input/output devices provided respectively 
for the tasks; a serial input/output processing section and a 

parallel input/output processing section which process signals 
transmitted between the first and second external device and 

the input/output processing section, and perform writing and 
reading operations with respect to the task memory input/output 

devices; and a task control section which applies commands 
written in the task input/output devices respectively to the 

tasks, and applies the states of process of the tasks 
respectively to the task memory input/output devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multiple-task controller
which is able to control a plurality of tasks with an external
device, and more particularly to a multiple-task controller in
which an external device controls a plurality of tasks through
memory input/output devices provided respectively for the
tasks.A multiple-task controller of this type includes a
plurality of tasks and a main task adapted to control those
tasks. The tasks are controlled through the main task by an
external device, so that their processes are performed, whereby
the external device is controlled.FIG. 3 shows a system comprising a conventional
multiple-task controller 110 and an external device 120. The
controller 110 includes a main task 111 and a plurality of
tasks 112a, 112b, .... Those tasks 112a, 112b, ... are so
designed as to perform their own processes. The controller 110
is connected to the external device 120. A remote control
signal Sa provided by the external device 120 is applied to the
main task 111. A remote control signal. Sa provided by the main
task 111 is applied to the external device 120. Upon reception
of the remote control signal Sa from the external device 120, 
the main task 111 decodes it and applies a command to a
predetermined task 112n (where the suffix "n" means
"arbitrary") to cause the latter to perform its own process.
The result of the process is applied, as a remote control
signal Sa, to the external device 120.Let us consider the case where, in the above-described
system, the external device 120 controls the tasks 112a, 112b,
.... . When, in this case, the external device 120 applies an
instruction to the main task 111 by using a remote control
signal Sa having predetermined contents, the main task 111
controls a given task 112n (where the suffix "n" means
"optional") with a command of language level. The result of
the process performed by the task 112n is applied to the main
task 11 through a command of language level, and it is
converted into a remote control signal Sa, which is applied to
the external device 120.As was described above, commands are used for the
control between the main task 111 and the tasks 112a, 112b,
...; that is, commands of language level are used to start,
stop and hold the tasks.The commands used in the above-described conventional
multiple-task controller are substantially equal in concept to
those used in the general computer. Hence, the commands are
rather difficult for a person to understand who has no general
knowledge of the computer. On the other hand, in the
