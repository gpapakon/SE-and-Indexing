<ABSTRACT>
In a method for introducing a counting tab (28, 47, 48) in a sheet pile (7), sheets (11) are transported in a continuous stream of sheets (12, 13, 14) and counted and placed one on the other to form a sheet pile (7), during transportation of the sheets (11), in each case after a particular number for the purpose of marking a ream pile (49), a counting tab (28, 47, 48) being attached to a sheet (11) located in the stream of sheets (12, 13, 14) in such a way that it comes to rest in the sheet pile (7) between two ream piles (49) and partially protruding out of the sheet pile (7, 8, 9). In order that the counting tabs (28, 47, 48) are inserted in the stream of sheets (12, 13, 14) in such a way that the ream pile (49) is bounded precisely and with a high degree of reliability after the intended number of sheets (11), a counting tab (28, 47, 48), which is provided on one side, and there only partially, with an adhesive, is stuck to the top of the sheet (11) conveyed last in each case for a ream pile (49) in such a way that the part of the counting tab (28, 47, 48) projecting beyond said sheet (11) is free from adhesive.

sheets (11) are fed in, following a certain number of 
them, for the purpose of marking a ream stack (49), a 

counting strip (28, 47, 48) is attached to a sheet (11) 
that is in the sheet stream (12, 13, 14), so that it 

comes to lie in the sheet stack (7) between two ream 
stacks (49) and partly protruding from the sheet stack

   characterized in that, on the last-fed sheet 

(11) for one ream stack (49), a counting strip (28, 47, 
48), provided unilaterally and only partly provided with 

adhesive substance, is glued on the top side so that the 
part of the counting strip (28, 47, 48) that protrudes 

over this sheet (11) will have no adhesive substance.

47, 48) are supplied laterally with respect to the 
direction of transport of the sheet stream (12, 13, 14). 
Process according to one of claims (1) to 
(5),
 
   characterized in that counting strips (28, 47, 

48) are used that are provided with an adhesive substance 
that allows complete separation of the counting strips 

(28, 47, 48) from sheet (11).  
 
Mechanism for performance of process 
according to one of claims (1) to (6),
 
   with a conveyor device (10) for feeding the 

sheets (11) in a continuous sheet stream (12, 13, 14), a 
counting device (41, 44) to count the sheets (11), a 

stacking device (6) at the end of the conveyor device 
(10) for gathering the sheets (11) into a sheet stack (7, 

8, 9) and with a counting strip feeding device (15, 16, 
17) that faces toward the conveyor device (10) revealing 

a container (18) for the counting strips (28, 47, 48) and 
a dispensing device (31) for the attachment of the 

counting strips (28, 47, 48) to the sheets (11), where 
the counting strip feeding device (15, 16, 17) cooperates 

with the counting device (41, 44) in such a manner that, 
each time, one counting strip (28, 47, 48), after a 

certain number of sheets (11), is attached to a sheet 
(11), located in the stream of sheets (12, 13, 14), that 

it comes to lie in the sheet stack (7, 8, 9) between two
