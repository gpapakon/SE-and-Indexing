<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the planting of seeds in loose or very loose ground. According to the invention, the seed drill (5) includes a depth-limiting device (56) which is intended to limit the downward travel of its device (28) for planting seeds in the ground to an adjustable maximum depth (59) below the surface of the ground (58), this surface being detected by a reference member (57).
