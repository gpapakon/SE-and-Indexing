<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tubular element for a hot gas pipe (conduit). The tubular element (1) includes a first end (2) and a second end (3), the second end (3) being provided with a flared part (8) intended to receive, by insertion, the first end of another tubular element for the purpose of forming a hot gas pipe. In accordance with the invention, the first end (2) is equipped with two annular ribs (4, 5) located at an axial distance one (4) from the other (5), and with a ceramic seal (9) located circumferentially between the two annular ribs (4, 5).

A tubular element (1) for hot gas conduit, comprising a first end (2) and a 
second end (3), whereby the second end (3) is provided with a bell-mouth (8) designed for 

accommodating, by stocking, the first end of another tubular element (16) in order to form a 
hot gas conduit, whereas the first end (2) is fitted with two ring-shaped ribs (4, 5) arranged at 

axial distance (a) one (4) from another (5) and wheras a gasket (9) has been placed on the 
circumference between both ring-shaped ribs (4, 5) characterised in that the gasket (9) is made 

of a braided ceramic material. 
A tubular element according to claim 1, characterised in that the greater size 
(b) of the section of the ceramic gasket (9) is smaller than the axial distance (a) between both 

ring-shaped ribs (4, 5). 
A tubular element according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that one (4) of 
both ring-shaped ribs is obtained by embossing a rim (6) defining an inlet to the tubular 

element (1) and in that the other one (5) of both ring-shaped ribs is obtained by moulding the 
first end (2) more or less at right angles with respect to the longitudinal axis (A) of the tubular 

element (1). 
A tubular element according to any of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it 
is made of stainless steel. 
A tubular element according to any of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that it 
is elbowed. 
A tubular element (100) fitted with a double wall for a hot gas conduit 
comprising an inner wall (11) and an outer wall (12) connected rigidly together and defining 

an intermediate space (13), characterised in that the inner wall (11) is a tubular element in 
compliance with the claim 1. 
A double-walled tubular element according to the claim 6, characterised in that 
the intermediate space (13) is filled with an insulating material (21; 22).  

 
A tubular element according to the claim 6 or 7, characterised in that the first 
end (2) is not covered by the insulating material (21) nor by the outer wall (12). 
A tubular element according to any of the claims 6 to 8, characterised in that 
the outer wall (12) comprises means (28; 29) designed for working together with a fastening 

element (30) capable of fixing, in a removable way, the tubular element (1; 100) to another 
tubular element (16; 101) after having stocked both tubular elements one into the other. 
A tubular element according to the claim 9, characterised in that the fastening 
element (30) is a quick-release collar. 
A hot gas conduit (200; 300) obtained by stocking at least a first tubular 
element (1; 100) into a second tubular element (16; 101), whereby both tubular elements (1, 

16; 100, 101) are in compliance with any of the claims 1 to 10.
