<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a ceiling mount (1) having a ceiling securing means (2), having at least one first mount arm (3) and having a column (5), borne by a mount arm, for bearing appliances and the like, in the case of which mount the individual parts are each rotatably connected by a rotary articulation (6). Seen in the vertical direction, each rotary articulation (6) exhibits a first bearing part (9) and a second bearing part (10) which interacts therewith. In order that a braking device, which brakes the relative movement of the parts with respect to one another, can, in design terms, easily be installed and removed for maintenance, preferably the bottom bearing part (10) exhibits an inner-cylindrical surface (11) which is aligned coaxially with respect to the pivot axis of the rotary articulation (6) and has a first diameter. The invention provides a braking device (14) which is connected to the other bearing part (9) and, for braking purposes, comes into braking engagement with the inner-cylindrical surface (11).
