<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the maximum likelihood decoding of 
convolutional codes, and more particularly, to Viterbi decoding of said 
codes and especially of partial response waveforms. This invention treats reducing complexity in implementation of 
Viterbi decoding of partial response waveforms. To appreciate this 
advance, several aspects of the art are briefly described. These include 
communication path constraints and the use of convolutional coding to 
match the characteristics of the path; Viterbi decoding of convolutional 
coded sequences and the trellis representation thereof; and partial 
response channels, codes, and waveforms. Generically, a communications system comprises an information 
source, an encoder, a noise free or noisy channel, a decoder, and a sink. 
Relatedly, Shannon's theorems on information theory state that signal 
power, channel noise, and available bandwidth limit the communication 
rate in bits/second over the channel. Also, there exist numerous signals 
or processes on the channel extraneous to source generated information 
which may alter or obliterate the information. The error or erasure of an encoded symbol string on the channel or 
portion thereof due to noise, jitter or other cause is manifest as an 
undesired modulation of the string in time or amplitude. This results in 
a received code string being either mistakenly identified or not 
identified at all. To reduce the effects of such channel originated 
disturbances, communications systems encoders have used channel and 
signal modulation encodings. A channel code adds redundancy to a bit 
string from the source while a signal encoding enhances waveform 
detectability of the waveform such as by preserving timing information or 
the like. Some techniques combine aspects of both. Convolutional codes are a general class of channel and signal 
encodings used in both communications and in magnetic recording.  A (n,k,m) convolutional code is a set of encoded sequences produced 
by a k-input, n-output encoder of memory order m having a code rate 
R = 
k/n and k<n  
. That is, a convolutional encoder generates n output bits for 
every k < n input bits. The performance of any particular convolutional 
code such as a (3,1,2) or a (2,1,16) depends upon the decoding algorithm 
employed and the distance properties. Advantageously, convolutional codes 
are employed as channel codes because they expand the number of bits per 
codeword and reduce the noise per bit. A convolutional signal encoding 
such as the partial response 4
