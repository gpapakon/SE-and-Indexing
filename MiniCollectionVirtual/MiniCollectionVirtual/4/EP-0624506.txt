<ABSTRACT>
The mount arrangement for transversely movable brake shoe assemblies (1) is constructed as a parallelogram-like 4-joint lever mechanism which has mount levers (15) which extend horizontally and essentially in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, coupled on the one hand to the vehicle frame (20) on the vehicle wheel side and on the other hand to the top of a brake shoe unit (1) in each case so as to be capable of rotating about vertical axes (12) of rotation. In order to increase their coupling base and rigidity the mount levers (15) can be of double-checked construction with 2 lever side elements (13, 14). In particular if the brake shoe unit (1) is coupled to the mount levers (15) so as to be capable of pivoting about a horizontal transverse axis (9) which extends transversely with respect to the vehicle, a torque support is to be provided at the lower end of the brake shoe unit (1), it being possible for the said torque support to be constructed as a pendulum lever (6) which leads to a counter bearing (7) or as a tie rod which crosses the vehicle wheel (5) and is coupled to a brake shoe device on the other side. If the tread of the vehicle wheel 5 is of conical construction, the mount levers (15) can be arranged in the normal position inclined by the cone angle or a somewhat larger angle with respect to the longitudinal direction of the vehicle such that they extend approximately at right angles to the tread of the wheel; with this arrangement, at least compensation of the downgrade force acting on the brake shoe (3) as a result of the conical wheel tread is obtained. As a result of the essentially horizontal longitudinal extent of the mount levers (15), the mount arrangement for the brake shoe unit (1) requires only a small overall height and is therefore capable of being accommodated and mounted on the rail vehicle without being impeded by other components.

Mounting arrangement for transversely movable 
brake shoe assemblies (1) on railway vehicles with 

transversely displaceable wheel sets, with double-cheeked 
mounting levers (15, 16), whose two lever 

cheeks (13, 14) arranged next to each other in a 
parallel manner are pivotably articulated at their one 

end around vertically-extending rotational axes on the 
vehicle frame (part 20) and at their other end near the 

upper end on the brake shoe assembly (1), each brake 
shoe assembly (1) being provided with two mounting 

levers (15, 16) extending approximately in the 
longitudinal direction of the vehicle and arranged 

offset to each other in the transverse direction of the 
vehicle, characterised by the following features: 


a) the rotational axes (12) of the couplings (18) on 
the brake shoe assembly (1) likewise extend vertically; 
b) on the brake shoe assembly (1) is rotatably 
mounted a pin (10) extending horizontally and 

transversely to the vehicle; 
c) on the ends of the pin (10) are pivotably 
articulated around the vertical rotational axis (12) 

the ends of the mounting levers (15, 16) facing the 
brake shoe assembly. 
Mounting arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in on the vehicle interior side the 

pin (10) is provided with a bearing eye (26) for 
articulating a track rod. 
Mounting arrangement according to one or more of  
 

the preceding claims, characterised by a prestressed 
spring (31), which directly or indirectly loads the 

brake shoe assembly (1) in the direction towards the 
interior of the vehicle (Figure 3). 
Mounting arrangement according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the spring (31) belongs to a 

spring buffer (27), whose push rod (32) loads one 
mounting lever (16) in the rotational direction inside 

the vehicle about its coupling (19') on the vehicle 
frame (part 20) or on a fixing part (23) fixedly 

connected to the frame. 
Mounting arrangement according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the spring buffer (27) is 

arranged on an anchoring (23), fixedly connectable to 
the vehicle frame (20) and having on its ends the 

articulation points (19, 19') for the two mounting 
levers (15, 16). 
Bearing arrangement according to claim 1 
constructed for a double-sided brake shoe arrangement, 

the torque support being formed as a pull rod (36) 
extending from the brake shoe assembly (1) to the other 

side of the vehicle wheel (5) and articulated there on 
an essentially vertical clamping lever (37), 

characterised in that the upper end of the clamping 
lever (37) is articulated analogously to the brake shoe 

assembly (1) by means of two mounting levers (15') on 
the vehicle frame (part 20) (Figure 5).
