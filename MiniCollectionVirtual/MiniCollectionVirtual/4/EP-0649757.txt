<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a heat mode recording material 
comprising on a transparent support a recording layer containing a 

light to heat converting substance, an image forming substance and a 
binder characterised in that there is present a heat decomposable 

intermediate layer between said transparent support and said 
recording layer and said heat decomposable intermediate layer being 

contiguous to said recording layer. High density images practically 
free of fog are obtained. The images are suitable for use as masks 

in contact exposures of lithographic printing plate precursors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat mode recording material 
and to a method for making images therewith. More in particular the 
present invention relates to an improvement of the quality, i.e. a 
low minimum density, of an image obtained with a heat mode recording 
material so that these images can be used as masks in a printing 
plate making process. In the process for preparing lithographic printing plates 
contact originals are prepared containing text and graphics. These 
originals are then used for imaging a printing plate. Such contact 
originals can be made by manually preparing a paste-up or they can 
be prepared by the aid of a computer. In the latter case the 
computer may control an output device, generally a laser, for 
imaging a recording material. A particular desirable recording material for imaging a printing 
plate contains the image on a transparent support allowing the 
printing plate to be exposed through the support of the recording 
material. In order to obtain a printing plate having good printing 
properties it is of particular importance that the minimum density, 
i.e. the density at the non-image areas, of the image on the 
recording material is extremely low. Generally it will be required 
that the minimum density of the image used as a mask for exposing 
the printing plate is below 0.05. A commonly used recording material is a silver halide 
photographic material that offers such advantages as high 
sensitivity, high density and good resolving power. However a 
silver halide photographic material requires special liquids for 
processing and as a consequence a lot of chemical waste is produced. 
Further silver halide photographic materials are susceptible to 
ambient light thus requiring handling in the dark. Due to the above disadvantages of silver halide photographic 
material, especially the ecological disadvantage, the need for more 
convenient and ecologically more acceptable recording materials 
exists. Especially interesting recording materials are heat mode  
 
recording materials because they are generally not susceptible to 
ambient light and can thus be handled in day light. Heat mode 
recording materials are disclosed in e.g. US-P-4.123.309, 
US-P-4.123.578, US-P-4.157.412, US-P-4.547.456 and PCT application 
WO 88/04237. The latter application discloses a web having an image 
forming surface and a porous layer of an image forming substance. 
The element further comprises a heat sensitive substance. Upon 
imaging with a laser the image forming surface is
