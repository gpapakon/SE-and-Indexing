<ABSTRACT>
A method for providing a flexible method for applying computationally significant association 
information in graphical input systems to information data using unrecognized visual 

information is disclosed. A method is provided to mark and index user-produced information 
(82) with special information designators called key objects (84,88,92) which can later be used 

as access mechanisms into the user-produced notes, without recognition of the notes. Visually 
recognizable, but computationally unrecognized, image segments are designated key objects. 

A key object is assigned a unique identifier that is computationally distinguishable from other 
key object identifiers. Key objects are associated with other data objects by attaching the key 

object identifier to other data objects in a data structure. A key object is easily created and 
reused, and provides a flexible and powerful indexing tool into graphically significant 

information without requiring the use of expensive or sophisticated recognition algorithms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for identifying computationally significant
relationships between data objects in a graphical input system. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a method for identifying computationally retrievable associations
between non-computationally distinguished objects, using non-computationally distinguished
objects.Graphically-based computer systems, for example mouse or pen-based computer systems,
input data in a state that is visually distinguishable by the user of the input device. These same
graphical input data, however, are often not distinguishable by the computer. Elaborate
methods to recognize handwriting have been developed to attempt to overcome this
problem.The process of creating computationally distinguishable associations in material in graphically-based
systems without computationally recognizing the material has been very difficult. The
material may be of any sort: images, text, graphics, or recorded material. It is desirable to
apply category indices to portions of material to label them for later retrieval of relevant
portions. Prior methods of annotating or categorizing material in real time using
computationally recognizable indices may require the user to either 1) click on and off a preset
list of categorizers, 2) attempt to type real-time notes to take advantage of the system's ability
to computationally recognize typed text, or 3) manually correlate notes, adding
computationally significant markers, at a later time. In all of these cases, users are forced to
comply with the computational limitations of the system rather than have a technique which
adapts to their natural method of notetaking. In order to make material more accessible, users
require a facile method for creating a set of personally structured annotations.Other proposed methods for categorizing material for later retrieval provide pre-defined
index categories, with some kind of menu or palette of these pre-defined indices provided to
the user, along with some kind of technique for attaching the indices to the portions. For
example, the indices can be arrayed in a button panel alongside a window displaying the
"current" portion of material; and indices could be attached to the current portion by
"touching" relevant buttons.A problem with this method is that pre-defined categories are not usually sufficient. The user
will want to create categories to better characterize the material at hand, and "ad hoc" 
categories will emerge during the process of examining the

A method for creating computationally significant associations between segments
of input image data stored in a memory (40), the method comprising the

following steps:

selecting (50) a first image segment of the input image data as a key object,
storing (52) said first image segment as a key object in said memory (40),
assigning (54) a unique computational identifier to said key object,
storing (56) said unique computational identifier in said memory (40) in association
with said key object,
selecting (58) a second image segment of the input image data to be associated
with said key object, and
storing (60) said unique computational identifier in said memory (40) in association
with said second image segment of the input image data for establishing

a relationship between said key object and said selected image segment.
A method according to claim 1, further comprising the steps of:

selecting (58) another image segment of the input image data to be associated

a relationship between said key object and said other selected image
segment.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein

said selecting steps (50, 58) are executed in response to signals from a stroke

enclosing the selected image segment, and
the image data of said key object further includes display features representing
the enclosure stroke, the enclosure stroke substantially enclosing said first image

segment.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, further comprising the step of providing
the image data of said key object image segment to an output circuitry

a memory (40) arranged for storing image data and at least one computational
