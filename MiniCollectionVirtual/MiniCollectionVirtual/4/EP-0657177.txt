<ABSTRACT>
When operating steam sterilisers, mainly in hospitals, it is customary to control the efficiency of the devices using chemical colour indicators which are subjected to a sterilisation process when placed in test bodies or systems in the sterilising chamber. The object of the invention is to provide a device which cannot give falsified test and control results and is reusable. This is achieved in that the container (1) consists integrally of a material which is impermeable to gas and liquid and has no lines or regions of weakness. The thermal insulation on the inner side of the bottom guarantees longer resistance to harmful air and thus effectively prevents the contact of steam with the chemical colour indicator. The container (1) and the filler material (8) are reusable owing to their design and material.

<CLAIMS>
Device for the testing and checking of steam sterilizers
operating acc. to the vacuum treatment with a container

made of a material which is non permeable for gas and
liquid with bottom and side walls designed to accommodate

an indicator (6) near the interior of the bottom and a porous
fibrous filler (7) to be arranged above, The characteristics

of which are that the container (1) is developed in one piece
with seamless wall of the bottom (3) and side walls (2) without

any weakening areas and weakening points. Therefore owing
to the difference of pressure during the sterilizations process

between the interior space of the container (1) facing the bottom (3)
and the exterior of the container there is no chance of any air and

steam gaps in the wall. The container (1) is open on the side
opposing the bottom (3)
Device according. to claim 1 distinguished in such that the
interior of the bottom (3) of the container (1) is fully covered

with a surface formation (5) of temperature and moisture
resistant material and that the material of the surface

formation (5) has a considerable lower caloric conductibility
than the material of the box (1).
Device acc. to claim 1, distinguished in such that the
porous, fibrous filler (7) consists of hydrophilic material.
Device according. to claim 1 or 3, distinguished in such that the
filler (7) consists of superimposed layers of surface formation.
