<ABSTRACT>
A constricting device for parts of the body has a lock housing (1), a constricting band (2) linked to a locking shoe (4) and a rocker (3) located in the housing that acts as a clamping device. The constricting band is guided through the housing over the rocker and when it is tension loaded the rocker is swivelled, securely clamping the constricting band against an abutment (1.6). At the front end of the rocker is arranged an actuating member (3.1) which extends upwards and is backwardly curved, so that the clamped band may be easily released by the thumb of the hand that holds the lock housing. In addition, by actuating with the thumb a pressure member located on the upper side of the lock housing, the locking shoe may also be easily released with the thumb.

Constricting device for parts of the body, 
having a lock housing which includes a base member, two 

lateral walls and, on the upper side, a cover wall, 
having a constricting band, which is connected at one 

end to the lock housing by means of a locking shoe and 
is guided through the lock housing so as to form a loop 

with its other free end between the base member and the 
cover wall, and having a rocker, which is pivotably 

mounted in the lock housing for secure clamping of the 
band and includes a plate-like portion, which is 

disposed above the base member and over which the free 
end of the band is guided, said plate-like portion being 

urged towards an abutment of the lock housing when the 
band is in its securely clamped state, which abutment is 

disposed above said band, and includes an actuating 

member, which is mounted in the region of the end face 
of the plate-like portion remote from the loop and 

extends within its extension range substantially over 
the width of the plate-like portion, said actuating 

member having a through-aperture for the free end of the 
band, the rocker being mounted over lateral axial 

portions in corresponding holes in the lateral walls 
and/or on a strip provided on the base member, 

characterised in that a central wall (1.6) is disposed 
as an abutment (1.6) above the plate-like portion (3.4) 

parallel to the base member (1.3) so as to be securely 
connected to the lock housing (1), which central wall 

has an unobstructed spacing from the upper side of the 
plate-like portion (3.4) when the latter is in its 

parallel position, said spacing being greater than the 
thickness of the band (2), in that the cover wall (1.7) 

of the lock housing (1) is shorter on its side remote  
 

from the loop relative to the plate-like portion (3.4) 
of the rocker (3), and in that the actuating member 

(3.1) is bent rearwardly and extends to the vicinity of 
this side of the cover wall (1.7), said actuating member 

protruding slightly beyond the upper side of the cover 
wall (1.7) in the clamped state or being flush 

therewith. 
Constricting device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the plate-like portion (3.4), the 

actuating member (3.1) and the lateral axial portions 
(3.3) are integrally formed. 
Constricting device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the plate-like portion (3.4) 

extends over the length of the base member (1.3) or 
protrudes beyond said base member with its end face 

facing the loop. 
Constricting device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a locking tongue 

(4.1) of the locking shoe (4), which is inserted into 
the lock housing (1), is locked in position in a recess 

in the cover wall (1.7) and is releasable by means of a 
pressure member (1.8) disposed in the recess. 
Constricting device according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the front end face (4.2) of the 

locking shoe (4) is resilient and presses against a 
fixed abutment (4.4), or in that the abutment (4.4) is 

resilient. 
Constricting device according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the pressure member (1.8)  

 
protrudes slightly beyond the upper side of the cover 

wall (1.7) of the lock housing (1) or is flush with said 
upper side. 
Constricting device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the locking shoe 

(4) lies with its underside on the upper side of the 
central wall (1.6). 
Constricting device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the locking shoe 

(4) has a stop member (4.3), which abuts against the 
side of the lock housing (1) facing the loop when the 

locking shoe has been inserted, the upper edge of said 
locking shoe preferably being flush with the upper side 

(1.7) of the lock housing (1). 
Constricting device according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the stop member (4.3) preferably 

has a recessed groove on its underside, the inside width 
of the recessed part corresponding to substantially 

twice the thickness of the band (2), and in that the 
band (2) is introduced into the recessed part by its 

folded-over end. 
Constricting device according to claim 9, 
characterised in that the folded-over end of the band 

(2) is provided with a clip (2.1). 
Constricting device according to one of claims 1 
to 10, characterised in that angular inclinations are 

provided on the side of the lock housing (1) facing the 
loop in such a manner that this side has a rounded edge, 

protruding in a direction towards the loop, between the  
 

insert apertures for the locking shoe (4) and for the 
band (2). 
Constricting device according to one of claims 1 
to 11, characterised in that the rear side of the lock 

housing (1) has a projection member (1.9), which is 
urged into a recess provided in the facing side of the 

stop member (4.3) and provided with a resilient element 
(4.2) when the locking shoe (4) has been inserted, or in 

that, conversely, the rear side of the lock housing has 
the recess with the resilient element and the facing 

side of the stop member has the projection member, and 
in that a locking tongue (4.1) of the locking shoe (4), 

which is inserted into the lock housing (1), is locked 
in position in a recess in the cover wall (1.7) and is 

releasable by means of a pressure member (1.8) disposed 
in the recess. 
Constricting device according to claim 12, 
characterised in that the resilient element (4.2) is 

rubber-elastic and lies in the recess or is configured 
as a leaf spring.
