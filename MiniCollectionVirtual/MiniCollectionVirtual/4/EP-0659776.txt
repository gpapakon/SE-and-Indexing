<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a polymer of a vinyl chloride monomer 
with improved particle size distribution by polymerising the vinyl 

chloride monomer under suspension conditions at a given stirring 
velocity and a specific power input in the range of 0.50 to 

2.0 W/kg, characterised in that initially a reduced stirring 
velocity of 70 to 90% (rpm/rpm) relative to the given stirring 

velocity is applied until at least 1%wt but no more than 15%wt of 
the vinyl chloride monomer is polymerised, whereupon polymerisation 

is continued at the given stirring velocity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for preparing a polymer of 
a vinyl chloride monomer with improved particle size distribution. 
In particular, the invention relates to a process for preparing a 
polymer of a vinyl chloride monomer (hereinafter "VCM") under 
suspension conditions at a given stirring velocity. Polyvinyl chloride (hereinafter "PVC", although also referring 
to copolymers of VCM unless otherwise indicated) is commonly 
prepared by suspension polymerisation of VCM in a stirred reactor. 
In commercial PVC plants, PVC particles are produced that generally 
have a particle size ranging from 20 to 500 micrometer. The 
particle size, and the particle size distribution, depends in 
particular on the reactor geometry, the type of stirrer, the 
additives used and the polymerisation conditions applied. 
Commercial PVC grades are sold with certain specifications, one of 
which is the fraction of particles greater than 250 micrometer. Of 
similar importance is the average and/or the mean particle size, 
and the bulk density of the PVC. The fraction of particles greater 
than 250 micrometer should be as small as possible. The bulk 
density is preferably about 0.5 kg/l or more. Generally, in commercial PVC grades, the fraction of PVC 
particles greater than 250 micrometer is removed by sieving and/or 
by similar techniques. This means that part of the PVC particles is 
wasted. Alternatively, the polymerisation recipe (e.g., the amounts 
of stabilisers used, etc.) is changed to produce PVC with a smaller 
average particle size, however at the detriment of the polymer 
properties (bulk density in particular). From DE-A-1,076,373 it is known that PVC particles of small 
particle size may be produced by polymerising the VCM at an initial 
high stirring velocity, followed by stirring at reduced velocity 
until the polymerisation reaction is complete.  From US-A-3,682,877 it is known that PVC of a predetermined 
particle size distribution and apparent density may be obtained by 
varying at least once the initial stirring velocity in the reactor 
during polymerisation. Thus, either the initial stirring velocity 
is subsequently increased with the resulting formation of a final 
polymer containing an increased proportion of coarse particles, or 
it is reduced with the resulting formation of a final polymer 
containing an increased proportion of fine particles. The skilled 
man would therefore believe the solution to the problem of reducing 
the formation of coarse particles (i.e., particles having a size in
