<ABSTRACT>
Improved washing machine (10) comprising: a wash-tub (14), a 
drilled basket (16); a detergent holding cup (22), communicating 

with said wash-tub (14) through a delivery hole (24); a discharge 
pump (28) connected to said wash-tub (14) through a mouthpiece 

(26) and to the discharge pipe (30); and an hydraulic air vessel 
(34) provided along the discharge pipe (30) and connected on one 

side to the discharge manifold (32) and on the other side to the 
detergent-holding cup (22) through a valve or electro-valve (38). 
Pump (28) is pulse-activated and pushes the washing solution into 
the hydraulic air vessel (34) from which it runs back during the 

pause of the pump. 
The washing solution runs out from manifold (32) only during the 
discharge stage and not during the stages when pump (28) is 

pulse-activated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved washing machine. More in 
particular, this invention relates to an improved washing machine 
provided with devices suitable to rapidly dissolve the detergent, 
utilizing it without any dispersal. As is known, washing machines for domestic use are provided with 
an horizontal axis, substantially cylindric wash-tub, where the 
washing fluid is caused to run into. Within such wash-tub a rotatory basket is located, having a wall 
peripherally provided with a plurality of holes, in which basket 
the linen to be washed is placed. In these machines, the washing cycle takes place according to 
different methods, in the presence of a certain amount of water 
in the wash-tub. There are basically three types of washing methods, which consist 
respectively in washing by repeated immersion of the linen, which 
is made to rotate in the basket, or by aspersion, caused by the 
systematic fall of the fluid on the linen, or by means of water 
jets, sent against the drilled basket and starting in general 
from the bottom of the wash-tub. In all these washing methods, detergent substances are added to 
the washing water, said substances being placed prior to the 
start of the cycle in a special cup provided in the washing 
machine. The water delivery tube debouches into the aforementioned cup, 
whose opposite end is provided with an opening comunicating with 
the wash-tub. The water which runs into the washing machine 
impregnates the detergent contained in the cup and drags it  
 
towards the bottom of the wash-tub, where the granular or powdery 
detergent progressively dissolves, under the effect of the water 
movement caused by the rotation of the basket. This system of detergent feed has a main drawback. The detergent contained in the cup, whose specific weight is 
generally higher than the one of water, is dragged by the latter 
towards the bottom of the wash-tub where the fluid discharge hole 
is generally provided. Therefore, a great amount of detergent is 
lost, being conveyed through said hole and settling in the 
portion of the discharge tube between the wash-tub and the pump. This happens, even though to a letter extent, also with 
detergents having a specific weight equal or lower than the 
specific weight of water. This drawback takes place even when fluid detergents are used. In 
fact, the amount of detergent which is lost is quite remarkable, 
as said, as the first flow of water run into the machine drags 
with itself, starting from the cup, a great deal of detergent.
