<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lyophilized aqueous parenteral 
solutions of physiologically active proteins and polypeptides 
attached to low diol polyalkylene oxide combined with the 
cryoprotectant cyclodextrin. More particularly, this invention relates to a lyophilized 
aqueous parenteral solution of superoxide dismutase attached to 
low diol polyethylene glycol combined with the cryoprotectant 
cyclodextrin. Biologically active proteins, particularly enzymes and 
peptide hormones, have been long considered as ideal drugs for 
the treatment of various diseases due to their specificity and 
rapid catalytic action. Such enzymes include:
 
   Oxidoreductases such as: Urate: oxygen oxidoreductase 
(1.7.3.3; "uricase");
 
   Hydrogen-peroxide: hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase 
(1.11.1.6; "catalase");
 
   Cholesterol, reduced-NADP: oxygen oxidoreductase 
(20-β-hydroxylating) (1.14.1.9; "Cholesterol 
20-hydroxylase").
 
   Transferases such as: UDP glucuronate glucuronyltransferase 
(acceptor unspecific) (2.4.1.17; 
"UDP glucuronyltransferase");
 
   UDP glucose: α-D-Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase 
2.7.7.12).
 
   Hydrolases such as: Mucopeptide N-acetylmuramylhydrolase 
(3.2.1.17; lysozyme); Trypsin (3.4.4.4); 
L-Asparagine aminohydrolase (3.5.1.1; "Asparaginase").
 
   Lyases such as: Fructose-1,6-diphosphate 
D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase (4.1.2.12; "aldolase").
 
 
   Isomerases such as D-Xylose ketol-isomerase 
(5.3.1.5; xylose isomerase) and
 
   Ligases such as: L-Citrulline: L-aspartate ligase (AMP) 
(6.3.4.5).
 
The peptide hormones include:
 
   Insulin, ACTH, Glucagon, Somatostatin, Somatotropin, 
Thymosin, Parathyroid hormone, Pigmentary hormones, 
Somatomedin, Erythropoietin, Luteinizing hormone, 
Chorionic Gonadotropin, Hypothalmic releasing factors, 
Antidiuretic hormones, Thyroid stimulating hormone, 
Calcitonin and Prolactin. Therapy with physiologically active proteinaceous 
substances, particularly with non-human enzymes, has been less 
than successful due in part to their relatively short half-lives 
and to their respective immunogenicities. Upon administration, 
the host defense system responds to remove the foreign enzymes 
by initiating the production of antibodies thereto, thereby 
substantially reducing or eliminating their therapeutic 
efficacies. Repeated administration of foreign and of otherwise 
short-lived human enzymes is essentially ineffective, and can be 
dangerous because of concomitant allergic response. Various 
attempts have been taken to solve these
