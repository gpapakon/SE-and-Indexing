<ABSTRACT>
A process and system in which the three fractions 
obtainable by dry subdivision of urban and like refuse 

(heavy fraction, organic fraction and light fraction) are 
worked in aqueous phase thereby obtaining only very small 

amounts of solid waste together with reusable plastics 
material and a good agricultural fertiliser. The working 

phases of the cycle are: extraction with water of the 
organic content of the heavy fraction; fermentation of 

the organic fraction and the extracts; pulping in water 
of the fermented mass, cleaning, disinfecting, extraction 

of the metallic compounds, dehydration; pulping in water 
of the light fraction, cleaning, separation of the 

plastics material, disinfection, mixing with the 
dehydrated organic material, final dehydration and 

drying.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and a system 
for obtaining the transformation of urban refuse (and the 
like such as commercial refuse, industrial and 
agricultural refuse with a matrix of organic material, 
gardening and graveyard refuse) with a high 
transformation yield into clean plastics material 
reusable for moulding or to produce energy, and a good 
quality fertiliser for agricultural use. The problems connected with the reutilisation of refuse 
components in agriculture or combustion are known to 
derive both from the difficulty of separation and the 
wide variety of individual components in the refuse. The 
composting methods currently in use have their own 
limitations due to the difficulty of separation and 
purification of the components, which are simply sub-divided 
into fractions which are internally 
inhomogeneous. In contrast to the current composting systems in which, 
after sub-division of the refuse into a heavy fraction, 
an organic fraction and a light fraction, fermentation of 
only the organic fraction takes place whilst, due to the 
aforesaid difficulties, the heavy and light fractions are 
left unaltered, the present process and system are 
characterised by:  processes performed on the entirety of the 
refuse; processes performed in aqueous suspensions; high transformation yield with consequent 
formation of a reduced quantity of waste to be 
eliminated; elimination of the organic content present in the 
heavy fraction to obtain clean and non-perishable 
solid wastes; obtaining reusable plastics materials; transformation into agricultural fertiliser even 
of woody and paper material which is rendered 
easily biodegradable; the possibility of eliminating metal compounds; obtaining a fertiliser free from extraneous 
bodies, pathogenic germs, live seeds, unpleasant 
odours, and phyto-and zoo-toxic substances. In general, the term transformation yield of a process 
is intended to mean that amount of refuse which is 
transformed into substances no longer intended for 
disposal, known composting methods are usually 
characterised by modest transformation yields. In such 
processes, in fact, of the three fractions obtained after 
a coarse dry subdivision, only the organic fraction is in 
any way transformed, giving rise to "compost". The result of this is thus that both the heavy fraction  
 
and the light fraction, which however also carry with 
them many organic substances, are still destined for 
disposal, that is to say they are still refuse. Whilst 
it is true that

<CLAIMS>
A process for transformation of refuse containing an 
organic matrix, particularly urban refuse, in which the 

chopped refuse is subjected to classification to obtain 
a heavy fraction, an organic fraction and a solid 

fraction, characterised in that the said fractions are 
further treated in aqueous phases to obtain non-perishable 

solid waste, suitable for disposal, recyclable 
plastics material and an agricultural fertiliser. 
A process according to Claim 1, in which the organic 
fraction, after fermentation, and containing extraneous 

substances to be separated, is dispersed in water by a 
pulping action to obtain a pulp including the said 

extraneous substances in suspension, the pulping action 
being conducted in conditions such as not to break up the 

extraneous substances and in such a way as to allow 
separation thereof by screening and/or centrifugal means. 
A process according to Claim 1 in which the heavy 
fraction including organic substances is subjected to 

extraction and washing for the extraction of an organic 
fraction and in which the washed heavy fraction 

containing solid waste, including iron has the iron 
separated from it by magnetic means to give non 

perishable solid waste and in which the organic fraction 
is possibly sent to the fermentation process. 
A process according to Claim 1 in which the light 
fraction, including extraneous substances to be separated 

is dispersed in water by pulping action to obtain a pulp 
including the extraneous bodies in suspension, the said 

pulping action being conducted in conditions such as not 
to break up the extraneous substances so that these 

maintain dimensions suitable for separation by screening 
and/centrifugal means. 
A process according to Claim 2 or Claim 4, in which 
the said pulping action is effected with the use of 

pulpers such as those used in paper mills, in conditions 
such as to break down the cellulose and lignin fibres 

present in the organic and light fractions for the 
purpose of rendering them easily biodegradable. 
A process according to Claim 2 or Claim 4, in which 
the pulp obtained from the treatment of the organic and 

light fraction is subjected to hydraulic separation for 
the removal of solid waste. 
A process according to Claims from 2 to 4, in which 
the pulp obtained from the said organic and light 

fractions are subjected to disinfection by heat treatment 
at temperatures greater than 60Â°C. 
A process according to Claims 2, 4, 5, 6 or 7 in 
which an agricultural fertiliser is produced by mixing 

 
the pulp extracted by hydraulic means from the light 

fraction with the dehydrated organic material obtained 
from the hydraulic purification of the fermented organic 

fraction. 
A process according to any preceding Claim in which 

the organic mass is present in aqueous suspension and is 
subjected to extraction of the components and metal salts 

by means of complexing or reactive chemical substances. 
A process according to Claim 2 or Claim 4, in which 
the aqueous dispersions obtained from the said light and 

organic fractions are heat treated to inactivate 
pathogenic germs and seeds. 
A process according to any preceding claim, in which 
the water obtained from the treatment of the light 

fraction is reutilised for washing the organic fraction. 
A system for performing the process according to any 
preceding claim. 
A system according to Claim 12, for the 
transformation of urban and like refuse, characterised in 

that the washing of the separable fractions of the refuse 
is effected by means of machines in use in the paper 

industry such as pulpers, cleaners, hydrocyclones, 
centrifugal separators, turbo removers and screw 

 
dehydrators. 
A system according to Claim 13 in which the pulping 
operations are effected by means of discontinuous 

pulpers, comprising a vessel having at the bottom a rotor 
provided with cutters capable of pulping the soft parts 

leaving the plastics and extraneous parts unaltered which 
can thus be eliminated using screening and centrifugal 

systems or with pulpers of discontinuous or continuous 
type. 
The use of paper-industry pulpers for the treatment 
in aqueous suspension of the light fraction and the 

organic fraction separated by classification from solid 
refuse.
