fixed, the end of the dispenser through which the strip (1) 
emerges is moved along beneath the lip (5) of the seal (2), 

and the strip (1) is continuously withdrawn from the 
dispenser (8) through the dispensing tip (9) as the 

dispenser (8) moves along beneath the lip (5) of the seal 
(2). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

(5) and of holding the lip (5) of the seal (2) in the 
raised position locally during the laying of the strip (1) 

beneath the lip (5), and in that the section of the inner 
opening of the tip (9) is reduced from its inlet (10)
