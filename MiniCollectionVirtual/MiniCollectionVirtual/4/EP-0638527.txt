<ABSTRACT>
Process for deposition by gas phase pyrolysis of a layer based on metal nitride or oxynitride, especially on titanium nitride or oxynitride, on a transparent substrate, especially of glass, characterised in that it consists in simultaneously bringing at least one metallic precursor and at least one nitrogenous precursor in the form of amine simultaneously into contact with the substrate heated to high temperature.

Process for the deposition by gas phase pyrolysis of a titanium nitride
or oxynitride-based layer on a transparent substrate, more particularly of

glass, characterized in that it consists of simultaneously bringing into
contact with the substrate raised to a high temperature at least one metal

precursor and at least one nitrogen precursor in amine form in a ratio of
approximately 2%, the thus obtained layer giving said substrate a colour

in transmission in the blue or blue-green range.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that deposition takes
place on a substrate constituted by a float glass ribbon, particularly in

the enclosure of the float bath.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
deposition takes place with a single distribution nozzle for spraying the

two types of precursors, without prior mixing, said precursors only coming
into contact on leaving the nozzle in the vicinity of the substrate.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the titanium precursor is a halide, particularly titanium tetrachloride

.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the nitrogen precursor in amine form is a primary or secondary amine,

particularly having alkyl radicals with 1 to 4 carbon atoms each.

Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
all the nitrogen precursors are in the form of an amine or a mixture of

amines.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that
with the nitrogen precursor or precursors in amine form is associated a

nitrogen precursor in the form of ammonia, e.g. with an association of the 
methyl amine and ammonia type.
Process according to claim 8, characterized in that the relative proportion
between the nitrogen precursor or precursors in amine form and the

nitrogen precursor in ammonia form is varied in order to shade the colour
in transmission given by the nitride or oxynitride layer to the substrate,

particularly between blue and green.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the substrate is at a temperature between 400 and 700°C, particularly above

500°C and more especially between 500 and 680°C.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
working takes place with an excess of nitrogen precursors compared with

the metal precursor or precursors.

glazing type for protection against solar radiation.
