<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to high density, high
signal, integrity electrical connectors and
specifically to connectors that are specially suited
for repetitive coupling and uncoupling with a printed
circuit board or the like.Interconnection of electronic devices such as
integrated circuits and printed circuit boards or the
like is complicated by the potential for wear and/or
damage to a connector through mating and de-mating of a
connector to the edge of a printed circuit board or the
like. Commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,044,980
discloses a high density, multiple insertion connector
that minimizes the amount of friction created by the
coupling and uncoupling of a connector wherein a
generally hourglass-shaped insertion member isolates
sliding contact between the components to surfaces of
low frictional resistance material during the majority
of the insertion and removal movements. Such a device,
however, requires the use of low frictional resistance
material along the entire width of the male and female
components of the connector and requires separate means
for registration alignment of the components.It would be highly desirable to provide a
connector including an opening accessory that could be
attached to the edge of a printed circuit board or the
like that would interact with only portions of a 
connector to open and allow controlled and aligned
closing of the connector about a printed circuit board
or the like without wear and/or damage to the
electrical conductors on either the connector or the
printed circuit board or the like. It would also be
desirable to provide a more versatile system for
interconnecting two printed circuit boards or the like.One purpose of the invention is to protect
the contacts on flexible circuitry or the like of a
connector from being damaged by the sharp edges of a
component such as a printed circuit board like member
that mates with the connector. To accomplish this
purpose there is provided a connector assembly, a
connector, a bridge connector and an opening accessory
which is attachable to the edge of a mating component
such as a printed circuit board like member, the
opening accessory having at least two cam means at
spaced positions along the edge of such a printed
circuit board like member, the cam means each having
associated camming surfaces to open and close a
connector that is to be mated to and de-mated from the
printed circuit board like member.In one aspect of the invention there is
provided an opening accessory for a connector
comprising: a base member
