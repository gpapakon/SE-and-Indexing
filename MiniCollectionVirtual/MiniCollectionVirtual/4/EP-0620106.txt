<ABSTRACT>
For producing a vibration insulator for use 
in a motor vehicle or the like, a unique method 

is described which comprises (a) producing an 
inner unit which includes an inner cylindrical 

member of metal (2) and a compounded rubber block (3) 
disposed about the inner cylindrical member; (b) 

applying an adhesive to an inner surface of an 
outer cylindrical member of FRP (1), the adhesive 

being of a type which is cured and hardened when 
heated; (c) press-fitting the inner unit in the 

outer cylindrical member; (d) putting an 
electrode plate (5) around the outer cylindrical 

member near the inner unit; and (e) applying a 
high frequency current to the electrode plate (5) to 

induce a high frequency dielectric heating by 
which the adhesive and the compounded rubber 

block are heated, the high frequency current 
having a frequency lower than 100 MHz.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a 
method of producing vibration insulators, and 
more particularly, to a method of producing 
vibration insulators used in motor vehicles or 
the like. More specifically, the present 
invention is concerned with a method of producing 
the vibration insulators of a type which 
comprises an outer cylindrical member of fiber-reinforced 
plastic, an inner cylindrical member 
of metal received in the outer cylindrical 
member, and a compounded rubber block interposed 
therebetween. Hitherto, various types of vibration 
insulators have been proposed and put into 
practical use particularly in the field of motor 
vehicles. One of them is of a type which 
comprises an outer cylindrical member of fiber-reinforced 
plastic, an inner cylindrical member 
of metal received in the outer cylindrical member 
and a compounded rubber block interposed 
therebetween. For production of the vibration 
insulators of such type, two methods have been 
commonly used. One method is as follows. First, an adhesive is applied to both an 
inner surface of the outer cylindrical member and 
an outer surface of the inner cylindrical member. 
The adhesive is of a type which becomes activated 
when heated to a certain level. Then, the inner 
cylindrical member is coaxially received in the 
outer cylindrical member and they are put into a 
mold which has been heated to about 150째C to  
 
170째C. Then, a liquid state (or insufficiently 
vulcanized) rubber material is poured into the 
mold and thus into a cylindrical clearance 
defined between the inner and outer cylindrical 
members. For sufficiently curing the rubber 
material, the temperature of the mold is kept at 
150째C to 170째C for a certain time. Thus, in this 
method, curing of the adhesive and that of the 
rubber material are achieved at the same time. 
In other words, the bonding between the outer 
cylindrical member and the compounded rubber 
block and that between the inner cylindrical 
member and the rubber block are achieved at the 
same time. For ease of understanding, this 
method will be named as "one-step bonding 
method". The other method, which will be named as 
"two-step bonding method", is as follows. First, an inner unit is produced by forming a 
compounded rubber block around the outer surface 
of the inner cylindrical member using the above-mentioned 
one step bonding method. That is, by 
this first step, the bonding between the rubber 
block thus formed and the inner cylindrical 
member is achieved. Then, the inner unit

outer surface of said rubber block near an 

electrode to which the high frequency current is 
applied is selectively heated to the highest 

temperature level, said highest temperature level 
ranging between the activation temperature of 

said adhesive and the decomposition temperature

source and the inner cylindrical metal member is connected 
to earth.
