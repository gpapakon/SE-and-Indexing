<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to new magnetisable lustre pigments based on coated, plateletlike, nonferromagnetic, metallic substrates coated with   A) a first, ferromagnetic layer comprising  gamma -Fe2O3 and, if desired, B1) a further, nonferromagnetic layer comprising metal oxide, and/or   B2) an outer, passivating layer comprising phosphate, chromate and/or vanadate, mixtures thereof with likewise coated, silicatic platelets, and the preparation and use of the pigments.

, and if 
desired 
B1) a further, nonferromagnetic layer, this time comprising a 
metal oxide, and/or 
B2) an outer, passivating, phosphate-, chromate- and/or vanadate-containing 
layer. 
Luster pigments as claimed in claim 1, wherein the nonferromagnetic, 
metallic substrate consists essentially of aluminum. 
Magnetizable luster pigment mixtures comprising 

I) the luster pigments of claim 1 or 2, and 
II) silicatic platelets coated with a ferromagnetic, 
γ-Fe

-containing layer and if desired an additional 
metal oxide layer and/or an outer, passivating, phosphate-, 

chromate- and/or vanadate-containing layer with 
or without a first layer of metal oxide underneath, 
 
as essential components. 
A process for preparing the luster pigments of claim 1 or 2, 
which comprises coating the metallic substrate in a fluidized 

bed 

a1) initially with a layer consisting essentially of magnetite, 
by gas phase decomposition of iron carbonyl in the 

presence of water vapor and/or oxygen, and then converting  
 

this layer by heating in an oxidizing atmosphere into 
a ferromagnetic γ-Fe

by gas phase decomposition of iron carbonyl in the presence 

of oxygen and/or water vapor, converting this layer 
by heating in a reducing atmosphere into an iron(II)-containing 

layer, and then converting the reduced layer by 
heating in an oxidizing atmosphere into a ferromagnetic, 

γ-Fe
2
O
3
-containing layer, and if desired 
b1) subsequently with a further layer, this time of a nonferromagnetic 
metal oxide, by gas phase decomposition of 

volatile metal compounds in the presence of oxygen and/or 
water vapor, and/or 
b2) with an additional, passivating, phosphate-, chromate- 
and/or vanadate-containing layer, by gas phase decomposition 

of vaporizable phosphorus, chromium and/or vanadium 
compounds in the presence of water vapor. 
A process for preparing the luster pigment mixtures of claim 

3, which comprises coating the metallic substrate and the uncoated 
or already metal oxide-coated silicatic platelets conjointly 

in a fluidized bed 

a1) initially with a layer consisting essentially of magnetite, 
by gas phase decomposition of iron carbonyl in the 

presence of water vapor and/or oxygen, and then converting 
this layer by heating the pigment mixture in an oxidizing 

atmosphere into a ferromagnetic, γ-Fe

, 
by gas phase decomposition of iron carbonyl in the presence 

of oxygen and/or water vapor, converting this layer

layer, and then converting the reduced layer by 
heating in an oxidizing atmosphere into a ferromagnetic, 

γ-Fe

-containing layer, and if desired 
b1) subsequently with a further layer, this time of a nonferromagnetic 
metal oxide, by gas phase decomposition of 

volatile metal compounds in the presence of oxygen and/or 
water vapor, and/or  

 
b2) with an additional, passivating, phosphate-, chromate- 
and/or vanadate-containing layer, by gas phase decomposition 

of vaporizable phosphorus, -chromium and/or vanadium 
compounds in the presence of water vapor. 
A method of coloring paints, printing inks, plastics, 
glasses, ceramic products and decorative cosmetic preparations, 

which comprises using the luster pigments of claims 1
