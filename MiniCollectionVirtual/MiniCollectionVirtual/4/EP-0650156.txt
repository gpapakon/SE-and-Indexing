<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a contact configuration for connecting a 
magnetoresistive sensor for sensing magnetic flux from a storage medium to further 
circuitry, and a storage medium read head including the same. Magnetoresistive (MR) sensors are used in magnetic storage systems to detect 
magnetically encoded information. A time dependent magnetic field from a magnetic 
storage medium or disc directly modulates the resistivity of the MR sensor. The change 
in resistance of the MR sensor can be detected by passing a sense current through the 
MR sensor and measuring the voltage across the MR sensor. The resulting signal can be 
used to recover information from a magnetic storage medium or disc. Practical MR sensors are typically formed using ferromagnetic metal alloys 
because of their high magnetic permeability. A ferromagnetic metal alloy is deposited in 
a thin film upon an electrically insulated substrate or wafer. Changing magnetic fields 
originating from the magnetic storage medium produce a change in the magnetization 
direction of the MR sensor and thereby change the resistance of the sensor. This 
phenomenon is called an MR effect. MR sensors have a maximum signal-to-noise ratio when the active region of the 
sensor has no movable magnetic domain boundaries or no domain boundaries. In other 
words, the active sense area of the MR sensor should be a single domain. The presence 
of domain boundaries in the sensor active area that move when a field is applied gives 
rise to Barkhausen noise, a phenomenon caused by the irreversible motion of a magnetic 
domain in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Barkhausen noise cannot occur if 
no domain boundaries exist. Typically, a single magnetic domain MR sensor is achieved 
by either utilizing geometry, or via boundary control stabilization or inherent 
longitudinal magnetic fields or any combination thereof.  During a read operation, an MR sensor transduces the data field of a medium 
directly by virtue of an MR effect and produces an MR voltage signal. However, the 
MR sensor also couples an ideally 90Â° out of phase voltage signal due to the inductive 
pickup from the contact loop configuration of the sensor current path providing current 
to the MR sensor (neglecting capacitance). The out of phase signal is undesired because 
it adds a coherent signal that is phase shifted away from the real MR signal attempting to 
be detected through use of the MR effect. Therefore, the MR sensor is detecting two 
different signals from a single
