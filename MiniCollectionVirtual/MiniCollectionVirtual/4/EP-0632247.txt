<ABSTRACT>
A plate-type heat exchanger, in particular a water-cooled oil cooler for internal combustion engines is proposed. This oil cooler consists of a plurality of plate members (10) which are stratified one above another in the manner of a stack and through which oil flows. A receiving part (18, 19) is connected to the plate members (10). This receiving part (18, 19) has an oil inlet bore (23) and an oil outlet bore. By means of a fastening screw (28), which on the one hand fixes the heat exchanger to a housing (20) via the receiving part (18, 19) and on the other hand seals the oil inlet (26) and oil outlet (27), a combined part is produced which fulfils a plurality of functions in a simple way.
