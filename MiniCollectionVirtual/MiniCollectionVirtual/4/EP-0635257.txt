<ABSTRACT>
Hair spray compositions in aqueous based systems containing 80% or less of volatile organic 
compounds exhibit a loss of spray performance properties resulting from viscosity and surface tension 

increases. The addition of 0.6 to 5% of one or more hydrophobic additives selected from the group 

consisting of hexamethyl disiloxane, bisphenyl hexamethicone and isocetyl alcohol improves the spray 
characteristics by eliminating foaming at the spray actuator and on the hair.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hair sprays containing 80% or less volatile organic compounds. In their most basic form, hair fixative compositions contain a film-forming 
polymer, which acts as 
the fixative, and a delivery system, which is usually one or more alcohols or a mixture of alcohol and 
water. In the case of aerosol delivery, the delivery system will also contain a propellant, typically a 
volatile hydrocarbon. Due to environmental regulations controlling the emission of volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere, VOC emissions have been restricted to 80% in some states, 
and may be restricted to 55%, by weight of the hair fixative formulation. It is foreseen that water will be 
substituted for the volatile organic compounds and so become a greater component in hair fixative 
compositions. However, many hair fixative polymers in current use exhibit a loss of spray performance 
properties in aqueous based systems; for example, the solution viscosity and surface tension increase, 
and if delivered by aerosol, the composition foams at the valve actuator and on the hair. These factors 
have prompted the search for additives to improve the spray characteristics of hair spray compositions 
that contain 80% or less VOCs. This invention relates to a hair spray composition giving improved spray characteristics 
comprising by weight 2 to 20% of a hair fixative polymer neutralized to a sufficient amount to effect 
subsequent removability from hair, 0.6 to 5%, preferably 1 to 4%, of one or more hydrophobic additives 
selected from the group consisting of hexamethyl disiloxane, bisphenyl hexamethicone and isocetyl 
alcohol, 80% or less of one or more volatile organic compounds, and the balance of water to a total of  
 
100%. Preferably, the hair spray composition comprises by weight at least 5% of water, more preferably 
at least about 20% of water. In another embodiment, this invention relates to a method for improving the spray characteristics 
of a hair spray composition comprising by weight 2 to 20% of a hair fixative polymer neutralized to a 
sufficient amount to effect subsequent removability from hair, in an aqueous solvent containing 80% or 
less of a volatile organic compound, the method comprising formulating the composition with 0.6 to 5%, 
preferably 1 to 4%, of one or more hydrophobic additives selected from the group consisting of 
hexamethyl disiloxane, bisphenyl hexamethicone and isocetyl alcohol. It has been found that the addition of certain hydrophobic additives to standard hair
