<ABSTRACT>
An image processing technique especially 
useful in processing digital radiographic images. A 

method for finding a histogram region of interest for 
improved tone scale reproduction of digital 

radiographic images includes the following steps. A 
digital radiographic image is randomly sampled (38) 

with a sample having an appropriate size to delineate 

an object of interest. Each sample is processed (40) 
using texture analysis techniques to extract a 

plurality of texture features. Using the extracted 
texture features, each sample is classified (42) with a 

previously trained neural network classifier to 
determine its class. Last, the pixel values belonging 

to the same class are accumulated (44) to form separate 
histograms for each class. Each of the histograms are 

then used to optimize tone scale reproduction (46).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to digital
image processing and more particularly to a technique
for finding the histogram region of interest for
improved tone scale reproduction of digital
radiographic images.In medical imaging, accurate diagnosis
depends on the detection of small, low contrast details
within the image. The probability of detection of
these details, in turn, depends critically on their
visibility in the image. A number of factors,
including the object (body part) being imaged, the
exposure geometry and technique, and the
characteristics of the detector can affect this
visibility.In conventional screen/film radiography, for
example, the output tonescale (that is, tone
reproduction function) is generally already designed
into the film by the film manufacturer, and a variety
of different films are available to get different
"looks" depending on exam types, exposing techniques,
and observer preference. In computed radiography (CR)
(as described in US-A-Re.31,847), on the other hand,
the separation of image acquisition and display stages
allows an image or portion of an image to be displayed
at an arbitrary output contrast depending on the
particular need. The ability in CR systems to adjust
this output tonescale in a computer before the final
image is displayed is one of the powerful features of
such systems. However, choosing or creating the
appropriate tonescale is not always a simple operation
because it depends on, among other things, the exam
type, exposure conditions, imaging modality, noise 
sensitivity of the image acquisition device, and
dynamic range of the output device.Commercially available computed radiography
systems typically include an edge enhancement stage and
then a tonescale stage. The purpose of tone scale is
to define an appropriate transformation function that
maps the important image information to the maximum
dynamic range of the display medium (either film or
soft copy, that is, CRT display). Various methods have
been proposed to generate tonescale curves for CR
images. In particular, the histogram-based tonescale
transformation is one of the most commonly used
techniques for enhancing such images because of its
efficiency. The following are exemplary of histogram-based
imaging techniques for processing digital medical
images: US-A-5,068,788; US-A-5,198,669;
US-A-4,839,807; US-A-5,040,225; US-A-4,914,295;
US-A-4,952,805.Generally, such histogram-based methods work
best when the peak(s) in the histogram corresponding to
the undesired regions are far enough away

interest for improved tone scale reproduction of

digital radiographic images comprising the steps of:

pseudo-randomly sampling (38) a digital
radiographic image with a sample having an appropriate

size to delineate a region of interest;
processing (40) each sample using texture

features;
using the extracted texture features,
classifying (42) the sample with a previously trained

neural network classifier to determine its class; and
accumulating (44),(46) pixel values belonging
to the same class to form separate histograms for each

said class, wherein each said histogram can be used to
optimize tone scale reproduction.
The method of claim 1 including the step
of segmenting (36) the digital radiographic image into

a background region, a foreground region, and an object
region of interest, and wherein the sampling step (38)

is performed on the object region of interest.
The method of claim 1 wherein the
sampling step (38) includes a linear pixel shuffling

technique.
The method of claim 1 wherein, before the
processing step (40), each the sample is preprocessed

by reducing the digital value of each sample pixel, and
performing an adaptive histogram equalization operation

(40) is performed on the central region of the

preprocessed sample.
The method of claim 1 wherein the
processing step (40) is performed using a gray-level

co-occurrence matrix texture analysis technique to
extract a first set of texture features, and also using 

a neighboring gray-level dependence matrix texture

The method of claim 5 wherein the first
set of texture features include energy, contrast,

correlation, local homogeneity, and entropy, and
wherein the second set of texture features include

nonuniformity, second moment, and entropy.
The method of claim 6 wherein the first
and second sets of features are determined at

intersample distances of 1, 2, and 3, such that each
set of features include at least fifteen features, and

wherein the thirty features are used in the neural
network classifier of the classifying step.
The method of claim 1 wherein the
histograms of one or more classes can be selectively

manipulated to change the tonescale reproduction of the
one or more classes.
The method of claim 8 wherein the
histograms are of one or more body regions of interest

and the tonescales of the one or more body regions can
be selectively changed to emphasize the one or more body

regions of interest.
