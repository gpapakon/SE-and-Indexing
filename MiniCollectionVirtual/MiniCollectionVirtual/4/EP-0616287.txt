<ABSTRACT>
Method for controlling the polarity of a digital signal (S) from a first integrated circuit (A), this digital signal (S) representing an information item (I) which is generated in this integrated circuit and being intended to be applied to an input of a second integrated circuit (B) requiring a predetermined polarity. The method comprises storage (MP) of the required polarity, performed outside the said first integrated circuit (A) at the output of the digital signal, a sequence (AC) for acquisition of the said stored required polarity during which the information item (I) is inactive, and a sequence (AP) of application of the said required polarity to the active information item (I) so as to generate on an output of the said first integrated circuit the digital signal (S) to be applied as input to the said second integrated circuit (B). Use in digital systems encompassing integrated circuits originating from multiple sources.
