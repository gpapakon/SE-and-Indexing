<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a homogeneous composition 
comprising yeast and an effective amount of a processing aid 

which composition maintains its homogeneity for at least two 
weeks. This composition can be used in the production of 

baked products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a yeast formulation, 
a process for preparing the formulation and to a process for 
preparing baked products using the yeast formulation. In the preparation of baked products, yeasts and 
processing aids are used to obtain standardized high quality 
products. In baking, besides bakers' yeast, processing aids such 
as bread improvers are used, consisting of oxidising and 
reducing agents, enzymes such as redox enzymes, α-amylases, 
amyloglucosidases, hemicellulases, cellulases, proteases, 
emulsifiers and fatty materials. Yeast, enzymes and redox agents are generally added 
separately to the dough. Yeast may be added in cream, 
compressed, active dry or instant dry form. Enzymes may be 
added in dry powder or in dissolved form. Redox agents are 
in most cases added in powder form. Weighing and dosing each of these various ingredients 
requires a separate of action to be carried out by the 
operator of the production process. The greater the number 
of actions to be carried out, the greater is the chance of 
an error occurring resulting in a product poorer quality. 
Moreover working with dusty materials may initiate an 
allergic reaction.  
 Mixing bread improving ingredients with dry granular 
yeast or instant dry yeast may lead to a homogeneous product 
directly after mixing. However, after transport and storage 
prior to the use, this type of product will have become 
inhomogeneous (see Example 1 hereafter). To solve these problems various solutions have been 
proposed. EP-A-0310460 describes the use of degradable capsules, 
filled with bread improving components, which are pressed in 
the surface of blocks of compressed yeast or packed in 
pouches together with instant dry yeast. This reduces the 
number of weighings and the dust problem. However, because 
the amount of bread improver present in one capsule is 
fixed, the quantities and ratios of wheat flour, yeast and 
other ingredients used are also fixed. J 54098352 describes the use of gelatine capsules, in 
which both yeast and bread improver components are present. 
This use also has the drawback, that only fixed quantities and 
ratios of wheat flour per capsule can be mixed into a dough. J 73040748 describes the mixing of granular semi-dry 
yeast (moisture content of 35 - 45%) with a wheat flour 
improving agent to be used in breadmaking. The stability of 
both flour improving agent and yeast is very limited due to 
high water content, so special attention has to be paid to 
storage and transport conditions. DE
