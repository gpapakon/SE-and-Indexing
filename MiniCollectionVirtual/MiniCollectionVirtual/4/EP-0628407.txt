<ABSTRACT>
A packaged easily oxidizable article and a process for 
packaging the article are provided, wherein the deterioration 

of the easily oxidizable article by its oxidation during heat 
sterilization or storage is prevented. 
A hermetically sealed plastic vessel filled with an 
easily oxidizable article is double-packaged in a flexible 

packaging bag wherein a plastic layer having heat-sealing 
characteristics, an inorganic oxide layer and a plastic layer 

are laminated in order from the inside.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a double-packaged
easily oxidizable article, comprising a hermetically sealed
plastic vessel filled with an easily oxidizable article such
as easily oxidizable medical and pharmaceutical products,
medical equipment, cosmetic products, foods and drugs, which
require heating and/or sterilization, which is packaged with
a packaging material having high oxygen barrier properties as
well as resistance to heat sterilization, and to the packaging
process thereof.Recently, many easily oxidizable articles which require
heating and/or sterilizing treatment have been packed in
plastic vessels, and made available after being subjected to
heat sterilization treatment. However, due to insufficient
oxygen barrier properties of the vessel, problems have been
caused in that the easily oxidizable article has been
deteriorated by the oxygen permeating into the vessel during
the heat sterilization or storage.For example, a material such as an amino acid transfusion
containing tryptophan causes the problem of browning or 
generation of a foreign odor and the like by the oxidation.
Accordingly, when a vessel filled with a medical and pharmaceutical
liquid drug, which is susceptible to oxidation, for
example, is to be sterilized by heating, as described in
Japanese Patent Laid Open Hei 57-206447, a method has been
employed wherein a retort is pressurized with an inert gas to
carry out high pressure sterilization in a saturated steam
atmosphere practically free from oxygen so that the content
is not oxidized nor degenerated during the heat sterilization.The conventional heat sterilization treatment method,
however, has been disadvantageous from the view point of requiring
a special apparatus, a complicated procedure and a
high cost.After carrying out such sterilization by heat, in order
to prevent the oxidation and deterioration of the content
during the storing period until it is actually used, the vessel
filled with the easily oxidizable medical and pharmaceutical
liquid drug and the like is covered and hermetically
sealed in a bag made of a laminated film comprising an intermediate
layer that has high oxygen barrier properties, such
as polyvinyl alcohol, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, polyvinylidene
chloride, aluminiuum foil or aluminium deposited
layer and the like (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Sho 59-80256,
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Hei 02-180129). In addition thereto according to Japanese Patent Publication
No. Hei 03-1021, a vessel filled with an easily oxidizable
liquid drug is packaged
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An easily oxidizable article in a double-package, comprising

a flexible packaging bag in which one or more hermetically sealed
plastic vessels filled with an easily oxidizable article, are

packaged and hermetically sealed;

wherein the flexible packaging bag comprises a plastic layer
having heat-sealing characteristics, an inorganic oxide layer and

a plastic layer laminated in the stated order from the inside to
the outside of the bag.
An easily oxidizable article according to
claim 1, wherein the inorganic oxide layer is a silicon oxide

layer and/or an aluminum oxide layer.
An easily oxidizable article according to
claim 1 or claim 2, which has been subjected to heat sterilization.
A process for packaging an easily oxidizable article in
a double-package, comprising a flexible packaging bag in which one

or more hermetically sealed plastic vessels filled with an easily
oxidizable article, are packaged and hermetically sealed, wherein

the easily oxidizable article is charged into the plastic vessel,
the vessel is hermetically sealed and packaged in a flexible packaging

bag comprising a plastic layer having heat-sealing
characteristics, an inorganic oxide layer and a plastic layer

which are laminated in the stated order from the inside to the
outside of the bag, by vacuum packaging or by filling under an

inert gas, then heat sterilization treatment is carried out in hot,
water or in steam.
