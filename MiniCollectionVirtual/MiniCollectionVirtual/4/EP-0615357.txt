<ABSTRACT>
An optical receiver for receiving the optical signals 
with high speed modulation at a high sensitivity. In this 

optical receiver, a local beam synchronized with a carrier 
of the optical signal is generated, and multi-frequency 

local beam components obtained from the local beam are 
spatially resolved to obtain spatially resolved beams with 

mutually different frequencies. Then, the optical signal 
and the obtained spatially resolved beams are entered into 

the photo-detector element array (12) simultaneously to obtain 
an interference fringe pattern. The received optical signal 

is then reconstructed by Fourier analyzing the interference 
fringe pattern obtained by the photo-detector element 

array (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical receiver
for receiving optical signals with high speed modulation in
an optical communication system.A conventionally known optical receiver adopts a
direct detection scheme to convert the optical signals
directly into the electric signals by means of a photo-detector
element such as a photo-diode. Consequently, in a
conventional optical receiver, the bandwidth of the
receivable optical signals is limited to the bandwidth of
the photo-detector element.In this regard, although the homodyne detection scheme
used in a coherent optical communication can improve the
reception sensitivity in comparison with the direct
detection scheme mentioned above, in this homodyne
detection scheme, the bandwidth of the receivable optical
signals is similarly limited to that of the bandwidth of
the photo-detector element or the bandwidth of the other
element such as a discrimination circuit for processing the
electric signals obtained by the photo-detector element.Consequently, the conventional optical receiver has a
limited response speed, and it has conventionally been
quite difficult both technically as well as economically to
realize an optical receiver capable of receiving the
optical signals with high speed modulation in forms of the
so called optical cells or optical packets for carrying a
finite bit-sequence within a finite temporal length T. More specifically, one example of a conventional
ultrashort light pulse measurement device is disclosed in
Y. Ishida et al., "Self-Phase Modulation in Hybridly Mode-Locked
CW Dye Lasers", IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics,
Vol. QE-21, No. 1, January 1985, pp. 69-77, which has a
schematic configuration as shown in Fig. 1.In this conventional device of Fig. 1, the ultrashort
light pulse is split by a half mirror 101 into two parts,
and one of which is reflected by a fixed mirror 102 while
another one of which is reflected by a movable mirror 103
to give a variable delay. These two parts of the ultrashort
light pulse are then focused by a lens 104 to a KDP crystal
for generating a second harmonic. At this point, due to the
variable delay given at the movable mirror 103, there is a
time difference between the arrival times of the two parts.
The second harmonic generated at the KDP crystal is then
entered into a monochromator 108 through a filter 106 and a
lens 107, so as to observe the resulting spectrum while
varying the variable delay. The original ultrashort light
pulse can then be reconstructed from the observed spectrum
