<DESCRIPTION>
 AUXILIARY POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING DC POWER ON DEMANDFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention pertains to power supply units suited to provide backup electrical power in the case of failure of the primary power from a source such as the commercial power grid.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Uninterruptible power supplies or systems (UPS) are coming into common use to backup the power supplied from the commercial power system to critical loads such as computers, telephone systems or medical equipment. In case of a black-out or disturbance on the commercial power system, the UPS takes over the supply of power to the critical load during the interruption. Although various designs are used for UPS systems, they typically provide power during black-outs from a storage battery through an inverter to the critical load during the time that the power system is down.Because most UPS systems utilize a battery to provide the stored energy to power the critical load during black-outs, the run time for UPS operation is limited by the storage capacity of the battery. Thus, the most 

 straightforward present way of extending the UPS run time is simply to use additional batteries. However, this approach has several difficulties. One is cost, since the number of batteries required is generally proportional to the desired run time. Moreover, increasing the number of batteries presents additional problems. Battery connections must be kept tightened and free of corrosion, which increases the maintenance cost. To achieve optimum battery life, the batteries must be maintained fully charged and at the proper temperature. Battery storage rooms often require special ventilation. Multiple strings of batteries often become unbalanced as they age. Large number of batteries also occupy valuable floor space and their weight may cause structural loading problems. Furthermore, batteries commonly require replacement in three to five years, which may be substantially less than the life time of the UPS system as a whole, thus increasing the cost of the system over its lifetime.An alternative to the use of additional batteries to provide auxiliary power to a critical load during long blackouts has been the use of a gasoline fueled alternating current (AC) generator (alternator) . AC generators have traditionally been used to provide backup power to critical loads, including entire buildings, during long power outages in the commercial power system. To avoid even a momentary interruption of power to critical loads, a UPS may be used to
