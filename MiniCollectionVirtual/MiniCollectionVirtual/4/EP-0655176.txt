<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an amplifier stage comprising at least one module presenting a first transistor (T1) whose base forms an input terminal and a means to maintain a substantially constant current in the collector-emitter path of the first transistor (T1). Said means is comprised of a first current source (A1) connected to the collector of the transistor (T1). A feed-back circuit has a direct voltage source (V3) arranged to maintain substantially constant the potential of the collector of the transistor (T1). It presents a path for the main current between a terminal (S'1) of the stage and the emitter of the transistor (T1). The value of said main current is a function of the voltage (V3) and of the potential (VCT2) of the collector of the transistor (T1); this potential remains substantially constant.
