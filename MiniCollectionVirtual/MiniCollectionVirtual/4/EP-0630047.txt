According to a method of manufacturing a 
semiconductor device of this invention, a first lead 

frame portion (4) has a bed portion (8) for mounting a 
semiconductor element (9) and a plurality of inner (2) 

and outer leads (3). A second lead frame portion (4) 

has a bed portion (8) for mounting a semiconductor 
element (9) and a plurality of inner and outer leads 

(2, 3) as in the first lead frame portion (4) coupled to 
the second lead frame portion (4) through a coupling 

portion. The first and second lead frame portions 
(4, 4) are folded at the coupling portion and superposed 

each other such that the two semiconductor elements 
(9, 9) oppose each other. At this time, the plurality 

of inner and outer leads (2, 3) of the first and second 
lead frames (4, 4) are alternately and adjacently 

arranged. Each electrode of the semiconductor elements 
(9, 9) is connected to a corresponding inner lead (2). 

The superposed first and second lead frames (4, 4) are 
sealed with a mold resin (10) while leaving end portions 

of the plurality of outer leads (3) of the first and 
second lead frames (4, 4).

The present invention relates to a lead frame and to a method of manufacturing
a resin-sealed semiconductor device, which
allows easy and correct positioning of semiconductor

semiconductor device has a structure in which a plurality
of lead frames, each prepared by mounting and
bonding at least one semiconductor chip thereon, are
superposed such that the surfaces on which the semiconductor
chips are mounted oppose each other, and the
leads of the lead frames are compressed and resin-sealed.However, in the above prior arts, a pair of lead
frames to be superposed are positioned at every semiconductor
chip. For this reason, the manufacturing process is
complicated, and correct positioning is not necessarily

semiconductor chip, and a second lead frame are stacked.The present invention has been made in  
consideration of the above situations.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a lead frame usable in a method of manufacturing
a resin-sealed semiconductor device.It is another object of the present invention
to provide a
method of manufacturing a resin-sealed
semiconductor device,
which can uniformly perform
more correct positioning for each product not only every
semiconductor chip but also when a plurality of semiconductor
chips are simultaneously superposed.In order to achieve the above objects, according to
the present invention, there is provided a lead frame according to claim 1. Further, there is provided a method of
manufacturing a resin-sealed semiconductor device in accordance
with claim 5. With the above arrangement, according to the method
of manufacturing a resin-sealed semiconductor device of
the present invention, when the continuous first and
second lead frame portions having semiconductor elements
mounted on their bed portions are folded at a coupling
portion to be superposed, and the two semiconductor
elements are opposed each other, easy and correct
positioning can be performed for the two semiconductor
elements and inner leads and corresponding outer leads.Especially, when a plurality of
