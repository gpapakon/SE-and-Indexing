<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a method and an apparatus, which permit virtually dust-free operation of a combined dividing and rounding machine equipped with a flour-scattering means. This is achieved in that, on the advancing belts (2 and 3) the flouring thickness is regulated via an adjustable suction removal means and, immediately after a deflection of the endless belts, the residual adhering flour is removed from the returning (bottom) belts by suction.
