<ABSTRACT>
A video answering machine (BA) for video and voice information is to be implemented. For this purpose, it is proposed to store only certain essential single frames, preferably time-synchronously with the speech, in a storage means (HS). In this arrangement, the calling party has the possibility of inputting the individual frames to be stored by means of suitable signalling. A semiconductor memory is proposed as storage means (HS).

<CLAIMS>
A video-telephone answering set (BA) having at
least


one receiving means (DM) for receiving a first
number of signals which comprise at least


a first picture signal belonging to a first
picture,
a second picture signal belonging to a second
picture, and
a third signal,

characterized in that the video-telephone answering
set further comprises


a comparing means (BD, SD) coupled to the receiving
means for comparing at least two signals and for

generating a result signal,
a selecting means (SP, BC) coupled to the receiving
means and the comparing means for selecting a second

number of signals in response to the result signal,
the second number of signals being less than the first

number of signals and comprising at least one picture
signal and not more than one of the first and second

picture signals, and
a storage means (HS) coupled to the selecting means
for storing the second number of signals.
A video-telephone answering set as claimed in claim
1, characterized in that the third signal is an

indication signal, with the at least two signals to be
compared comprising the indication signal and a signal

stored in the video-telephone answering set, and the
result signal indicating which signal of the picture 

signals must be selected and stored.
A video-telephone answering set as claimed in claim
2, characterized in that the comparing means comprises

a signal decoder (SD) for comparing the indication
signal with the stored signal.
A video-telephone answering set as claimed in claim
1, characterized in that the third signal is a third

picture signal belonging to a third picture, with the
at least two signals to be compared comprising a

further indication signal and a signal stored in the
video-telephone answering set, and the result signal

indicating which signal of the picture signals must be
selected and stored.
A video-telephone answering set as claimed in claim
4, characterized in that the comparing means comprises

a signaling decoder (SD) for comparing the further
indication signal with the stored signal.
A video-telephone answering set as claimed in claim
1, characterized in that the third signal is a third

picture signal belonging to a third picture, with the
at least two signals to be compared comprising at

least two of the picture signals, and the result
signal indicating which signal of the picture signals

must be selected and stored.
A video-telephone answering set as claimed in claim
6, characterized in that the comparing means comprises

a picture-change detector (BD) for comparing the
picture signals.
