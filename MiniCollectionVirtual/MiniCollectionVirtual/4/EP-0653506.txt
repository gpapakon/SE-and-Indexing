<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pair of positive
holding and pulling pincers for weaving looms.Specifically the present invention relates to a
pair of positive holding and pulling pincers for
insertion of weft threads of a fabric in a weaving loom
adopting belt processing or other known systems.Positive pincers for weaving looms incorporating
weft gripping mechanisms are known and generally used in
the industry. Said pincers comprise thread gripping
devices activated for opening and closing through
suitable mechanisms provided on the machine outside said
pincers. Known pincers therefore require movement
control systems which are very costly and complicate to
regulate and also require rather long response times for
opening and closing of said pincers. Consequently looms
adopting said conventional pincers are relatively slow
and their productivity is not very high. 
FR-A-1 480 561 discloses a pair of positive pincers for insertion of
weft threads of a fabric in a weaving loom comprising a holding pincer
and a pulling pincer moved by a conveyor belt having a rectilinear,
alternating and horizontal movement and provided with a thread
blocking device and means for opening and closing said blocking
device.The purpose of the present invention is to overcome the shortcomings
and limitations of presently known pincers.In its more general aspect the present invention permits solving the
above shortcomings by means of a pair of improved holding and pulling
pincers in which opening and closing of the weft blocking device takes
place by means of a very simple mechanical system provided in said
pincers and activated by a striker plate fixed on the 
loom. Weaving looms provided with the pincer pairs of the
present invention exhibit a considerable increase in
speed and productivity. Accordingly the subject matter
of the present invention is a pair of positive
pincers for insertion of the weft threads of
a fabric in a weaving loom, comprising; a holding pincer and a pulling pincer fixed to
a support and moved by a
conveyor belt provided with a rectilinear, alternating and
horizontal movement; each pincer comprises:
a flat spring or rod having one end co-operating
with a plate fixed to the support, said spring or
rod being pivoted in its median portion on a pin fixed
to said support;a means for approaching said end to or withdrawing
it from the fixed plate, said means comprising a
moving cursor provided with an oblique guide groove in which
slides the end of the spring or rod opposite that co-operating
with the fixed

the fixed plate (15,49);
a means of blocking the moving cursor (11,31);
a first lever (3,38) operated by a moving striker plate
of the loom,to give a rectilinear advancing and backing

movement to said cursor (11,31) and to release said
blocking means in the advancing phase of said

cursor (11,31), and
a means of releasing said blocking means in the
backing phase of the cursor (11,31).
The pair of pincers according to claim 1, characterized in that the
holding pincer (P) comprises:


a first cursor (1) moving on horizontal guides formed on the support
and provided with a first guide slot (la) and a second blocking slot

(1b) with relating striker (4) and countersink (5);
a second cursor (11), provided with an oblique groove (11a), integral
with said first cursor (1) through a rod (12);
a coil spring (18) fitted on said rod (12) and arranged between the
second cursor (11) and a guide element (22) for the rod (12) fixed to

the support;
a flat spring (16), having one end for blocking the weft thread, provided
with a first plate (14) fixed in the intermediate position and a

second plate (13) fixed to the end opposite the blocking end; the first
plate (14) being pivoted on a pin (20) fixed to the support and the second

plate (13) being provided with a rung (13a) sliding in the oblique
