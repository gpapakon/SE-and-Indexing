<ABSTRACT>
A method for resolving (+-)-/(alpha)/-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid is disclosed. The method comprises: i) converting said propionic acid with (-)-cinchonidine in a solvent comprising a mixture of an aliphatic ester and an alkyl alcohol; ii) separating the diastereomeric salt from such conversion; iii) purifying said separated diastereomeric salt by a single recrystallization; and iv) isolating highly pure (+)-(alpha)-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid without any further recrystallization.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RESOLUTION OF KETOPROFENField of InventionThe invention relates to a process for resolution of mixtures of enantiomeric arylpropionic acids and for obtaining one of the enantiomeric forms of the acids, in which the mixture is converted with a chiral base in an inert solvent to a diastereoisomeric salt and the desired acid enantiomer is separated therefrom.Background of InventionIt has been firmly established that enantiomers with (S)-configuration of chiral derivatives of α-phenyl-propionic acid, as well as those of some other α- heteroaryl-propionic acids, possess predominant, if not exclusive, anti-inflammatory activity.The resolution of the racemates has been successfully accomplished using both physical and chemical techniques.Chromatographic separation has been carried out using a variety of substrates.Coutts et al., investigated enantiomeric mixtures of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). They discovered that these readily react with ( + )- or (-)-amphetamine (AM) in the presence of l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole. The resulting NSAID-AM diastereoisomeric amides are easily separated by gas chromatography (GC) or by a fused silica ME silicone capillary column. See Development of Drugs in Modern Medicine. 232-6, Edited by Gorrod et al., Herwood, Chichester, U.K. (1986).Profen derivatives and some other acidic compounds were resolved by using HPLC with an ovomucoid-conjugated column. The retention of acidic compounds was markedly reduced by the addition of sodium octane sulfonate, while that of amines was reduced by a cationic ion-pairing agent. The ovomucoid-conjugated column exhibited the best chiral recognition ability when the protein molecule was in a state as close as possible to its native form. See Miwa et al., J. Chromatog.. 408. 316-22 (1987). 

 In Okamota et al., Chirality. 1(3) 239-42 (1989), the direct optical resolution of anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and flurbiprofen acid was attempted by HPLC using tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)s of cellulose and amylose as chiral stationary phases. Although ibuprofen was not sufficiently resolved, the other three 2-arylpropionic acids were completely resolved by the amylose derivative. Ibuprofen was resolved as the anilide derivative.Rendic et al., Chirnia. 29(4) 170-172 (1975) describes the resolution of ketoprofen by (R)-α-phenylethylamine. The products were separated by column chromatography on silica. However, chromatographic separations, while useful as an analytical tool, are not typically capable of
