<ABSTRACT>
In the karaoke system 1, a center 3 and a plurality 
of karaoke terminals 5 are connected by a coaxial cable 7. 

The polling modem 13 modulates the polling signal to a predetermined 
channel signal and transmits it to a karaoke 

terminal 5 and also receives a response signal (signal for 
responding as to whether a song has been requested) transmitted 

from the karaoke terminal 5 in response to the polling 
signal. When a song is requested, the data transmission 

control portion 15 retrieves the karaoke song data of the 
requested song from the memory means 19, modulates it via the 

data transmission modem 17 into an alternating current signal 
that differs from the channel of the polling signal, and 

transmits it to the karaoke terminal 5.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transmission 
system wherein a central control unit and a plurality of 
terminals are connected by a transmission line, the data 
transmission system being for transmitting information data 
from the central control unit to a terminal. Conventionally, there is known a data transmission 
system, wherein a center (central control unit) is connected 
to a plurality of terminals by a transmission line. The data 
transmission system is for transmitting information data 
including various types of information from a center to a 
terminal according to demands from the terminal side. An 
advantage of this type of data transmission system is that a 
memory device for prestoring data information need not be 
provided to each terminal, so that the terminals have an 
extremely simple construction. In the data transmission system, it can be proposed 
that transmission and reception of the information data is 
controlled by polling between the center and the terminal. 
That is, polling signals are transmitted in succession from 
the center to the plurality of terminals. Every terminal is  
 
interrogated to determine whether the each terminal requests 
transmission of information data. When there is a request 
for transmission from a terminal that has received the 
polling signal, the request data, which indicates the content 
and the like of the request, is transmitted from the terminal 
to the center. After the request data has been received at 
the center side, the desired information data is transmitted 
to the terminal over the channel over which the polling 
signal has been transmitted. According to this method, however, a polling signal 
can not be transmitted from the center while information data 
is being transmitted to a terminal via the transmission 
cable. Therefore, this will cause a problem in that the 
waiting time at a terminal increases and a long time is 
required for the desired data to be transmitted from the 
center. Particularly, a large scale system with external 
transmission lines can have a great many terminals so that 
information data can not be transmitted quickly to individual 
terminals. It is therefore an objective of the present invention 
to overcome the above-described problems and to provide a 
data transmission system wherein a terminal can obtain 
desired information data with a short waiting time. The present invention provides a data transmission  
 
system for controlling transmission of information data via 
a transmission line from a
