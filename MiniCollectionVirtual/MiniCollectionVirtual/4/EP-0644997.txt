<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and an apparatus for determining the size and shape of a slot, for measuring, e.g., the profile of the discharge opening (slice) of a paper machine. In the method, by means of at least two magnetometers (6) attached to an edge (2 and/or 5) of the slot, the magnetic field depending on the size and shape of the slot is measured. According to the invention, an alternating electrical current is applied to a current conductor (1) attached to the edge (2 and/or 5) of the slot to create an alternating magnetic field, measurement of the alternating magnetic field is phase-locked with the applied electrical current, and the size (d) and shape of the slot are calculated from the measured values of the magnetic field.

<DESCRIPTION>
An object of the invention is a magnetic measuring method according to claim 1 for 
measuring the size and shape (profile) of a slot. An object of the invention is also an apparatus for determining the size and shape of a slot. The method can be applied to measuring the thickness and, especially, the profile of a 
material web passing through a slot. As a special application the method can be used, 
among other things, for continuous measuring of the discharge opening (slice) of the head 
box of a paper machine. The size and profile of a slot can be measured with a known method based on eddy 
currents: Let us suppose that the slot is underneath limited by an electrically conducting edge such 
as the lower lip 5 of the slot in Fig. 1. One measures at a high frequency (in the order of 
100 kHz or more) changes in the inductance of a coil attached to the upper edge 2 of the 
slot. If a capacitor is connected in parallel with the coil, thereby forming a resonant 
circuit, one may measure changes in the resonant frequency of the circuit. The changes 
in the inductance or resonant frequency are proportional to the distance of the coil from 
the electrically conducting lower edge. A weakness of this method is its sensibility to eddy 
currents induced into other electrically conducting structures surrounding the slot. For 
example, adjacent to the discharge opening of a paper machine there are often shield plates 
which in practice totally prevent the application of the eddy current method. The size and profile of a slot can also be measured by means of a permanent magnet. As 
an example of this method, to the lower edge 1 of the solution according to Fig. 1 
permanent magnets are attached at specified distances from each other. The magnetic field 
created by them is measured by magnetometers attached to the upper edge 2 of the slot. 
The method based on permanent magnets has two essential weaknesses. Magnetization of  
 
permanent magnets is known to be dependent on temperature. If the method is required 
to be accurate and stable, the temperature of the permanent magnets must be stabilized or 
their magnetization measured and compensated for the changes in magnetization in the 
measurement results. Besides, when operating with permanent magnetic fields the 
disturbances caused by the environment are a problem. For example, getting of an extra 
permanent magnet near to the magnetometers will distort the desired signal. Known is also a method (the published FI specification 73831), wherein the thickness of
