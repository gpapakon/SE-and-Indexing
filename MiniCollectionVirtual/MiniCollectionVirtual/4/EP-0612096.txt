<CLAIMS>
A driving device for a rotary anode of an X-ray tube, which device
comprises a drive motor (5) having a
 stator (5a) and a rotor (5b), which are operated at
anode potential and which are spaced by a gap, the rotor shaft (6) driving the rotary

anode (7), and the motor (5) being powered by means of a potential-isolating
transmission means, 
characterized in that
 the rotor (5b) of the drive motor (5) is
constructed as an external rotor and the rotor comprises a concentric copper or

aluminum first cylinder (5e) which faces the gap, and the rotor (5b) comprises an iron
second cylinder (5f) which surrounds the first cylinder (5e).
A driving device as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the rotor
length is equal to or greater than the length of the lamination assembly of the stator but

smaller than the overall length of the stator.
A driving device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the
stator interior is perforated so as to allow the introduction of a cooling fluid.
A driving device as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized
in that
 the rotor is a squirrel-cage rotor.
A driving device as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
in that
 vacuum separation between the rotor and the stator is provided by a nonmagnetic
separation layer, which also supports the stator lamination assembly.
A driving device as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the
separation layer is made of nickel chrome steel, a ceramic or glass.
A driving device as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized
in that
 the potential-isolating transmission means is powered from a single-phase mains,
from a three-phase mains, or with a direct voltage which is available in an X-ray tube.
