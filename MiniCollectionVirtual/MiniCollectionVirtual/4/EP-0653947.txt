<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for lowering or raising people and/or loads over great heights, in which a rope pulley is rotatably fitted on a base plate via a brake disc. A brake pad is allocated to the brake disc on one side on the base plate and on the other on a pressure plate secured against rotation. Pressure can be applied to the pressure plate by a tension bolt passing through the brake disc bearing and the tension bolt is coupled to the suspension of the device via a power deflection device via which the weight of the person and/or load to be lowered or raised can be converted into a tensile force on the bolt. A concentrically arranged toothed wheel is connected to the brake disc which engages with a gear system also fitted in the base plate via which an additional centrifugal braking device can be actuated. Here, the suspension (16) of the device takes the form of a pull-rod (15), preferably guided to be movable on the base plate (1), the end (19) of which, which is in the device, can pivot on an arm of a bell-crank lever (17), the other arm of which is pivotably connected to the tension bolt (9) and which is fitted to pivot on the base plate (1) in the region of its angle (20).

Appliance for the lowering or lifting of persons 
and/or loads down from or up to a great height, 

wherein a rope ring (2) is supported rotatably by 
means of a brake pulley (3) on a base plate (1), there 

being associated with the brake pulley (3) brake 
linings (6, 7) disposed one at one side on the base 

plate (1) and the other at the other side on a 
pressure plate (8) locked against rotation, wherein 

pressure may be exerted upon the pressure plate (8) by 
a tie bolt (9) extending through the bearing 

arrangement of the brake pulley (3), and the tie bolt 
(9) is connected to the suspension device of the 

appliance by a force-deflecting device (14), by means 
of which the weight of the lowered or lifted person 

and/or load is convertible into a tensile force at the 
bolt (9), and wherein there is connected to the brake 

pulley (3) a concentrically arranged ring gear (22) 
which meshes with a gear train (23; 26, 27; 31, 32; 

33, 34), which is likewise supported in the base plate 
(1) and by means of which at least one additional 

centrifugal braking device (37, 38) is drivable, 
characterized in that the suspension device (16) of 

the appliance is formed by a tie-rod (15), which is 
preferably guided displaceably on the base plate (1) 

and of which the end (19) situated in the appliance is 
pivotally supported on one arm of an angle lever (17), 

of which the other arm is pivotally connected to the 
tie bolt (9) and which in turn is pivotally supported 

in the region of its angle (20) on the base plate (1). 
Appliance according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the tie bolt (9) acts upon the pressure plate (8) by 

means of a spherical cup-shaped surface (10), which 
engages into a diametrically opposed recess in the 

pressure plate (8).  
 
Appliance according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that a known stop device (51, 52) for preventing the 

rope from running in one direction is provided at the 
centrifugal braking device (37, 38) provided in 

addition to the braking device (6, 3, 7) which may be 
acted upon by the tie bolt (9), and that by means of 

said stop device through the intermediary of a 
friction clutch (54, 55) at least one stop pin (57) 

may be applied against the brake blocks (41) of the 
centrifugal braking device (37, 38) in the sense of an 

increase of the braking force. 
Appliance according to claim 3, characterized in that 
for each of the two directions of rotation of the 

brake pulley (3) and of the ring gear (22) connected 
thereto a separate centrifugal braking device (37 or 

38) is provided, which centrifugal braking devices may 
be brought into operation depending on the direction 

of rotation of the brake pulley (3). 
Appliance according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the tie-rod (15) is 

longitudinally adjustable, preferably by means of a 
screw (65), in the sense of a preadjustment of the 

tensile force of the tie bolt (9). 
Appliance according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the screw (65) is disposed on the base plate (1) or on 

a part (66) firmly connected thereto and acts upon a 
lever (63), the swivelling axis (64) of which is 

likewise disposed on the base plate (1) or on a part 
firmly connected thereto, the lever (63) engaging into 

a recess (60) of the tie-rod (15) and resting against 
the transversely extending flanks (61) of the recess 

(60).  
 
Appliance according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that acting upon the angle lever (17) 

is an additional adjusting device (68 - 71) for
