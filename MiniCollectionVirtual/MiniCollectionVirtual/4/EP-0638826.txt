<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing a waveguiding structure, of the type comprising 
an optical waveguide supported by a semiconductor substrate, for splicing to an optical 

fiber, is described. In accordance with the disclosure, a layer of glass is deposited 
over a distance from the end of said waveguide, and the underlying semiconductor 

substrate is removed over a portion of said distance. The resulting modified waveguide 
can then be fused to optical glass fibers using standard fusion machines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to integrated optical circuits and, in particular, to 
silicon optical bench waveguide structures, and methods for coupling such structures 
to glass optical fibers. It has been recognized that if integrated optical circuits are to be 
incorporated into fiber communication systems, a practical method of coupling such 
circuits to glass fibers must be devised. The typical integrated optical device is fabricated by the deposition of 
doped silica films on a silicon substrate. The films are then patterned to produce 
waveguides. See, for example, J.T. Boyd et al., Optical Engineering Vol. 24, No. 2, 
pp. 230-234, (1958), and F.S. Hickernell, Solid State Technology, Vol. 31, No. 11, pp. 
83-88, 1988. The use of such techniques permits the fabrication of a variety of 
integrated optical devices such as multiplexers, adiabatic polarization splitters, and 
array star couplers. In order to couple into and out of such devices, optical fibers are butt-coupled 
to the waveguide ends, and secured thereto by means of a bonding material 
such as an epoxy. In order to stabilize the attached array of fibers, and to provide 
sufficient confinement of the evanescent field of the guided wave, the device may be 
covered with a thin silica coverplate, affixed with a low loss adhesive, as described in 
U.S. Patent 5,076,654, issued Dec. 31, 1991, and assigned to applicant's assigne. Methods for aligning and permanently attaching fibers to waveguide 
devices on lithium niobate are described in a paper entitled "Fiber Attachment for 
Guided Wave Devices" by E.J. Murphy, published in the 
Journal of Lightwave Technology, 
Vol. 6, No. 6, June 1988. As indicated in this paper, permanent 
attachment, after alignment, is typically made using some type of adhesive.  The problem with the above-described arrangements is that the use of 
an epoxy, or other type or adhesive in the optical wavepath, is unacceptable for certain 
applications, such as submarine cables. Heat, applied during the curing period, or as 
a result of high intensity light signals, tends to deteriorate the adhesive and, hence, the 
bond. Accordingly, the use of such adhesives is to be avoided. An alternative bonding technique, using glass as the adhesive, as 
described in U.S. Patent 5,208,885, issued May 4, 1993 and assigned to applicant's 
assigne, produces very satisfactory heat insensitive connections. However, it has a 
number of commercial drawbacks. For example, the implementation of this technique 
requires a number of additional
