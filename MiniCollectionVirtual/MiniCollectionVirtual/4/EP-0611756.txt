<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cathepsin L inhibitor and bone
resorption inhibitor containing an alcohol or aldehyde derivative, or salt
thereof as an active ingredient.Osteoporosis is a pathologic state or disease involving some symptom or
risk due to quantitative bone reduction exceeding a certain degree. Major
symptoms are spinal kyphosis, fractures of dorsolumbar bones, vertebral
centra, femoral necks, lower end of radius, ribs, upper end of humerus, and
others. In normal bone tissue, bone destruction occurs constantly, but there is
good balance between bone formation and resorption; osteoblasts and
osteoclasts play key roles in bone formation and bone resorption, respectively.
Upon deterioration of this balance, bone resorption surpasses bone formation,
resulting in quantitative bone reduction. Drugs suppressing bone resorption
are therefore expected to serve well in preventing and treating osteoporosis.
Traditionally, bone resorption-suppressing agents such as estrogens and
calcitonin have been used to treat osteoporosis. However, these therapeutic
agents fail to achieve satisfactory effect in some cases, due to subject
limitations or uncertain efficacy. There is therefore need of a new
prophylactic/therapeutic method for accentuated bone resorption.It has recently been shown that cathepsin L, a protease secreted by
osteoclasts in the process of bone resorption, is integrally involved in the
decomposition of collagen, a bone supporting protein. Presumably therefore,
bone collagen decomposition due to bone resorption can be prevented by
inhibiting cathepsin L activity, a means useful in the prevention and
treatment of osteoporosis. Epoxysuccinic acid derivatives, such as those
disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 304074/1990,
304075/1990 and 304085/1990 are known to exhibit cathepsin L inhibitory
action.Traditionally, leupeptin and antipain have been known to inhibit
protease activity, and various compounds have been synthesized as aldehyde
derivatives from amino acids. For example, acetyl-Leu-Leu-tryptophanal,
acetyl-Leu-Leu-phenylalaninal etc. are disclosed as chymotrypsin inhibitors 
in Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 49, p. 343
(1972). Peptide-derived phenylalaninal and tryptophanal derivatives are
disclosed as chymotrypsin inhibitors and myodystrophy remedies inWO 8400365. Also, WO 9214696 and WO
9204045 disclose the anti-HIV activity of peptide-derived phenylalaninal
derivatives and the CCK (cholecystokinin) antagonist activiity of
