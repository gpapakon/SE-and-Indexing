<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel cephalosporin and 
carbacephalosporin/paraben complexes, and methods of use of 
such, particularly for isolation and purification of the β-lactam 
antibiotic. Cefaclor, cephalexin, cephradine and loracarbef have 
the structures as set out below: 
 
The four β-lactam compounds, in which the C-2' (*) 
asymmetric centers have the R absolute configuration, are 
commercially important oral antibiotics. Various references discuss isolation and/or 
purification processes for the β-lactam compounds, such as 
that found in European Patent Application 0,341,991 
published November 15, 1989. In that EPO application is 
disclosed the use of anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonic acid to 
form a pharmaceuticallY acceptable salt with the particular 
cephalosporin or carbacephalosporin, which allows for 
recovery of the β-lactam from mother liquors after 
crystallization. As these antibiotics are expensive to make, new and 
improved procedures for such recovery are continually being 
sought in order to maximize overall yield. The commercially important antibiotics cephalexin, 
cefaclor, cephradine and loracarbef have been observed to 
form crystalline complexes with parabens and related 
compounds. Complexes of cephalosporins which can be used 
for isolation or purification, are disclosed in 
EP-A-0,003,329, EP-A-0,308,123 and US-A-5142042. The present invention is directed to complexes of the 
formula  
 
 
wherein 
X is chloro, hydrogen, vinyl or -CH3, Z is CH2 or S; n is 0-5; Y is phenyl or 1,4-cyclohexadien-1-yl; R1 and R2 are hydrogen or hydroxy, with the proviso 
that R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen and R3 is CO2H, -COO(C1-C4 alkyl), -NO2 or 
 
wherein R4 is C1-C4 alkyl.  
Further, the invention is directed to the preparation of 
the above complexes in order to recover antibiotic 
material. The terms "complex" and "cocrystal" are used to 
describe the single solid state phase resulting from the 
combination of the antibiotic and the paraben or related 
compound. The preparation and isolation of cephalexin, cefaclor, 
cephradine, or loracarbef paraben complexes are simple and 
straightforward. Aqueous and substantially aqueous 
solutions or suspensions of the β-lactam and paraben or 
related compound are mixed and the components are allowed 
to co-crystallize at a temperature in the range of 0 to 
65°C. The preferred amount of paraben or related compound 
added is 1 to 3 equivalents per equivalent of β-lactam 
used. In each case, formation of cocrystals was demonstrated 
by its unique X-ray
