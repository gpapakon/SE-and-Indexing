<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pyrotechnic device for ejecting, in a way which is variable and adjustable at the last moment, an article with respect to a structure, comprising an assembly (2) of two sliding elements; pyrotechnic means (5) capable of ejecting the said article; means (6) of rotating the said article comprising a coupling with a pin (10) and an inclined ramp (11); and a releasable mechanism (7) for retaining the said article. Advantageously, the said means (5) comprise a plurality of mutually independent controllable pyrotechnic sources (5A), the said coupling of the means of rotating is defined by a plurality of pin-ramp couplings (12) in which the physical characteristics of the inclined ramps (11) are different, and means (14) are provided for maintaining the pin corresponding with the said selected coupling in its ramp and for withdrawing the other pins from the ramps.

Device for ejecting an object from a structure by
a pyrotechnic means, of the type comprising:


an assembly (2) consisting of two sliding components
of the cylinder and piston type, in which one

component (3) is secured to the said structure and
the other component (4) carries the said object;
pyrotechnic means (5) associated with the said
assembly and capable, when initiated, of ejecting

the said object by the sliding of the said element
carrying the said object from a retracted position

to a deployed position, the said pyrotechnic means
comprising a number of controllable pyrotechnic

sources;
means (6) capable of rotating the said object as the
said corresponding component slides, and comprising

a connection by way of a finger (10) and an inclined
ramp (11) one provided on each of the said

components; and
a releasable retaining mechanism (7) keeping the
said object associated with the corresponding

component when the latter is in its retracted position,

characterized in that the said controllable pyrotechnic
sources (5A) are independent of one another, in that the

said connection of the rotation means is defined by a
number of finger-ramp couplings (12) in which the physical

characteristics of the inclined ramps (11) are
different, and in that it comprises means (14) for

controlling the said fingers (10) in such a way as to 
keep the finger that corresponds to the said chosen

coupling in its ramp and move all the other fingers off
the ramps.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said controllable pyrotechnic sources (5A) are

housed in a body (9) attached to the said component (3)
secured to the structure and they communicate with the

said assembly (2) via respective passages (9B) formed in
the said body and opening into an internal chamber (8) of

the said assembly, this chamber lying between the two
said components.
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the said inclined ramps (11) of the

said couplings have different lengths.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the said inclined ramps (11) of the said

couplings have different pitches.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the said means (14) for controlling

the fingers are defined, for each finger, by a motor
member (15) with which the said finger (10) is associated

and which is connected to the component (3) secured to
the said structure, the said motor member (15) being

capable of engaging the finger (10) in the corresponding
ramp (11) or of withdrawing it therefrom by axial displacement

of this finger at right angles to the longitudinal
axis of the said assembly.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the said motor members (15) and their respective

fingers (10) are mounted, with uniform angular spacing
from one another, in the open end (3C) of the said

element secured to the structure, this being the opposite
end from its bottom (3B) to which the said body (9)

carrying the said pyrotechnic sources (5A) is attached
coaxially.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the said releasable retaining

mechanism (7) is composed of:

a rod (18) passing coaxially through the said 
assembly and connected, at one (18A) of its ends, to

the bottom of the said stationary element secured to
the structure;
an axially split nut (19) having at least two parts
and interacting, when the said sliding component (4)

is in the retracted position, with the other
threaded end (18B) of the said rod, so as to press

against the said object which is itself resting on
the said sliding component; and
a hollow tube (20) which can be displaced by the
action of the said pyrotechnic means and which

concentrically surrounds the said rod (18), and a
first end (20A) of which hollow tube, when the said

sliding component is in the retracted position,
holds the said parts of the nut (19) in place, while

its second end (20B) is arranged in the internal
chamber (8) of the said assembly between the two

components so as to communicate with the said pyrotechnic
means (5).
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the second end (20B) of the said hollow tube is

widened so that it can slide, in leaktight fashion, in
the said chamber (8) and has an external peripheral

groove (20C) into which the said respective passages (9B)
of the said separate pyrotechnic sources open.
Device according to any one of the preceding
Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that it additionally

comprises controllable means (22) of adjusting the stroke

of the said sliding component with respect to the said
stationary component of the said assembly, these adjustment

means being associated with the said assembly (2)
and making it possible to alter the stroke specific to

each finger-ramp coupling (12).
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the said controllable adjustment means comprise:


a threaded hollow sleeve (23) surrounding the said
assembly and prevented from moving in axial translation

on the said stationary component;
a motor member (25) capable of rotating the said 
sleeve; and
a nut (26) mounted on the said sleeve and unable to
rotate with respect to it so that when the said

sleeve is rotated by the said motor member, the said
nut moves axially along the said assembly to determine

the stroke of the said sliding component as a
function of the said chosen coupling (12) and form

an end-of-stroke stop therefor.
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in
that the stroke of the said sliding component (4) is

limited by a stop (27) which is associated with it and
which, when the said pyrotechnic means are initiated,

presses against the said nut (26) of the adjustment
means.
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the said stop (27) is connected to the said sliding

component by a number of lateral lugs (28) extending
around the said component (3) secured to the structure

and linking the stop (27) to the said sliding component
(4), and in that the said nut (26) of the said adjustment

means has radial tabs (26A) which fit between the said
lateral lugs (28) so as to be prevented from turning.
