<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a solar chimney arrangement, and in particular to an arrangement which includes a chimney (11, 31) to receive fluid originating from a solar heat collector (7, 27, 6, 26) and a turbine (2, 32) to be driven by the fluid. The solar heat collector has an evaporative area (6, 26) and a non evaporative area (7, 27), the non-evaporative area acting as heat absorbing area and having a first cover (8, 28) adapted to inhibit evaporation of a heat-absorbing liquid retained therein, the evaporative area having a second cover (4, 24) connected to the chimney and adapted to contain vapour evaporating from a liquid in the said evaporative area, there being means to transfer thermal energy from the liquid of the non-evaporative area to liquid of the evaporative area. The solar heat collector increases the moisture content and the temperature of the air flowing past the turbine.

 SOLAR CHIMNEY ARRANGEMENTFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a solar chimney arrangement.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONA solar chimney arrangement typically includes a solar chimney having an associated wind turbine, the wind turbine being energised in response to an updraft of solar-heated air in the chimney. Such an arrangement can be environmentally friendly.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTIn a known form of solar chimney, the air for use in the updraft is solar-heated beneath a glass collector roof. To obtain a volume of heated air sufficient to effect sustained operation of a wind turbine of a size suitable for the commercial generation of electricity, the collector roof needs to cover a large land area, and is of a construction both expensive to erect and costly to maintain.French patent 2,307,982 shows a chimney carrying a turbine, the chimney being surrounded by an annular pool which is 

covered by a transparent plastic sheet preventing evaporation. Surrounding the pool is a slab of black- painted concrete. The pool and concrete are covered by a glass canopy. During periods of sunlight the glass canopy permits the concrete slab to heat up, and this in turn heats the air above, which flows into the chimney. The pool serves as a heat sink, storing heat during sunlight hours and giving out this heat during the night.French patent 2,436,268 shows a chimney having a solar panel around its base, to form an air-heating chamber, whereby the air circulates normally i.e by natural in¬ draught from the outside to the inside of the container, to rise in the chimney stack.US patent 4,452,046 shows a tower, to which is connected at least one separate "hydric hothouse". Each hydric hothouse has a black (thermally absorbent) base covered by a transparent surface providing a membrane sheet over water. The hot air from above the water in each hothouse is sent through a pipe to the chimney installation.STATEMENT OF THE INVENTIONIt is the object of this invention to improve upon the efficiency of the known solar collection systems, by 

increasing the temperature and moisture content of the air flowing to the turbine.From one aspect of the invention we now propose a solar chimney arrangement which includes air heating means comprising a liguid solar-heat absorber.From another aspect of the invention we propose a solar chimney arrangement in which a solar chimney is associated with a non-evaporative area and an evaporative area, the non-evaporative area having a first cover adapted to inhibit evaporation of

CLAIMS
1. A solar chimney arrangement which includes a chimney (11,31) to receive fluid originating from a solar heat collector (7,27, 6,26) and a turbine (2,32) to be driven by the fluid, characterised in that the solar heat collector has an evaporative area (6,26) and a non evaporative area (7,27), the non-evaporative area having a first cover (8,28) adapted to inhibit evaporation of a heat-absorbing liquid, the evaporative area having a second cover (4,24) connected to the chimney and adapted to contain vapour evaporating from a liquid in the said evaporative area, and means to transfer thermal energy from liquid of the non-evaporative area to liquid of the evaporative area.
2. An arrangement according to claim 1 which includes transfer means (22) to feed heat absorbing liguid from the non-evaporative area into the evaporative area to intermix with the liquid already in the evaporative area.
3. An arrangement according to claim 1 or claim 2 which includes transfer means to feed heat absorbing liquid from the non-evaporative area into the evaporative area at a level above liquid in the non-evaporative area, and angled flow means (26,36) in the evaporative 


 area to effect gravity flow of liquid back to the non- evaporative area.
4. An arrangement according to any of claims 1-3 in which the said first cover is adapted to float on top of the liguid in the non-evaporative area, and in which the said first cover is multi-layer, the layers being separated by one of inflated balls, rigid foam and styro-foam balls, and struts, and ropes.
5. An arrangement according to any of claims 1-4 in which the said second cover (4) extends beyond the evaporative area and has a gap adjacent one of its edges for ambient air to inflow, and in which the connection to the chimney is by a chimney inflow opening (16)
6. An arrangement according to any of claim 1-5 in which the evaporative area and the non-evaporative area comprise one of liquid filled pans and trenches dug into the ground.
7. An arrangement according to claim 8 in which the said pans and trenches are between 2.5cm and 15cm deep.
8. An arrangement according to claim 6 or claim 7 in which the said pans and trenches are lined with a heat absorbing material. 


9. An arrangement according to any of claims 1-8 in which the said non-evaporative area and the said evaporative area surround the chimney.
10. An arrangement according to any of claims 1-9/ in which the solar heat collector is adapted to increase the moisture content of the air above the evaporative area by at least 2%, and to increase the temperature of the air above the evaporative area by at least 3°C, over that of the surrounding ambient air.
