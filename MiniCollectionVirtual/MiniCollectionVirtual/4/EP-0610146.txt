<ABSTRACT>
Acetabular prosthesis, comprising in combination:   - an artificial acetabulum (2) which includes a certain number of expansion slots (2a) regularly distributed over its periphery, a threaded appendage (2c) provided on its external face and, more particularly, at its pole, and a tapped hole (2d) which is pierced at the middle of the appendage (2c) and which emerges inside the said acetabulum; - an intermediate core (3) which has an external diameter (A) greater than the internal diameter (B) of the acetabulum, a threaded finger (3a) which interacts with the tapped hole (2d) of the acetabulum (2) and, on its internal face, a series of notches (3b) which are regularly distributed over its periphery; - and a plastic insert (4) which comprises a certain number of teeth (4b) which interact with the notches (3b) of the intermediate core for positioning it and orienting it angularly.

<CLAIMS>
An acetabulum prosthesis comprising an artificial acetabulum or
hollow hemispherical cup (1) made of metal, which includes a certain

number of expansion slots (2a) regularly distributed around its
periphery, a threaded intermediate element (3) having an outside

diameter (A) greater than the diameter (B) of the acetabulum, and an
insert (4) of plastics material such as polyethylene and including a

groove (4c), with the intermediate element (3) on its inner face and
the insert (4) on its outer face including projections and

indentations that co-operate together for the purpose of positioning
them and setting their angular position, the prosthesis being

characterized in that:

said artificial acetabulum (2) includes a threaded appendix
(2c) provided on its outer face, more particularly at its pole,

together with a tapped hole (2d) opening out to the inside of the
acetabulum (2) and in the center of the appendix (2c);
the intermediate element is a core (3) having an outside
profile corresponding to the inside profile of the acetabulum (2),

and including a threaded finger (3) that co-operates with the tapped
hole (2d) in the acetabulum (2), and on its inside face a series of

notches (3b) which are regularly distributed around its periphery;
and
the insert of plastics material (4) comprises a certain
number of teeth (4b) which co-operate with the notches (3b) of the

intermediate core and beneath the teeth, the groove (4c) is bordered
by a projection (4d).
An acetabulum prosthesis according to claim 1, characterized in
that the expansion slots (2a) are all directly towards the pole of

the acetabulum (2) so as to cause it to be in the form of a plurality
of same-area segments (2b).
An acetabulum according to claim 1, characterized in that the
intermediate core (3) includes on its inside face and beneath the

notches (3b), a retaining ring (3d) which is bordered in its bottom
portion by a wedge-shaped groove (3e). 
An acetabulum according to claim 1, characterized in that the
intermediate core (3) includes on its periphery, an opening (3c)

which interrupts the notches (3b).
A prosthesis according to claim 1, characterized in that the
artificial acetabulum (2) and the intermediate core (3) are made of

the same material, such a titanium.
