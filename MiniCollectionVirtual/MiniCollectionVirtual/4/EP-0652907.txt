<DESCRIPTION>
 PERMANENT AQUEOUS MARKER INKSBackground of the Invention This invention relates to marking compositions. Traditionally, permanent inks for use in markers have been provided in liquid form, as solvent-based or aqueous solutions. Solvent- based inks generally provide good adhesion and wetting on a wide variety of smooth, difficult to wet substrates, e.g., glass, plastic and metal. However, there is an increasing desire in the field to reduce or eliminate solvent use, due to environmental and safety concerns, and, secondarily, to avoid the unpleasant odor of solvent-based inks. Aqueous inks, formulated to replace solvent based inks, generally do not wet all substrates, particularly plastics, glass and metal, and are often not water-fast.The invention features permanent aqueous marker inks that can be used to mark, e.g., paper, plastics, glass, and metal.One aspect of the invention features an aqueous marker ink which includes a hydrocarbon surfactant, a fluorocarbon surfactant, a pigment, a film-forming acrylic polymer, and water. In preferred compositions, the acrylic polymer is provided in the form of 

an emulsion, and the acrylic is a thermoplastic acrylic, more preferably polymethyl methacrylate. Preferably, the hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon surfactants are provided in a weight ratio of about 1:1.In another aspect, the invention features an aqueous marker ink which includes an alkylphenol ethoxylate surfactant, a fluorocarbon surfactant, a pigment, a film- forming polymer, and water. In preferred compositions, the alkylphenol ethoxylate surfactant is an octylphenol ethoxylate.In a third aspect, the invention features an aqueous marker ink which includes a silicone surfactant, a film-forming polymer, a pigment, and water. In preferred compositions, the silicone surfactant is a siloxane or silane surfactant and the silicone surfactant is fluorinated. The compositions may further include a fluorocarbon and/or a hydrocarbon surfactant.Preferred inks include, by weight, about 0.1 to 1, more preferably 0.2 to 0.6 percent of the surfactant(s) , about 10 to 40, more preferably 20 to 30 percent of the film- forming polymer, about 2 to 8 percent pigment, and sufficient water to provide a viscosity of less than about 20 cps. The ink may also include a small quantity (preferably 1-10%) of a low (less than 5) carbon alcohol.The invention also features a method of marking a substrate, e.g., glass, plastic or metal. The method includes the steps of providing a marker having a reservoir, the reservoir containing one
