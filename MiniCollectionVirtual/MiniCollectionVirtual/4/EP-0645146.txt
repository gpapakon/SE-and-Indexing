<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use in 
diagnostic imaging, in particular X-ray, ultrasound and 
scintigraphy of contrast agents comprising complexes of 
multinuclear moieties, and to contrast media containing 
such complexes. All diagnostic imaging is based on the achievement 
of different signal levels from different structures 
within the body. Thus in X-ray imaging for example, for 
a given body structure to be visible in the image, the 
X-ray attenuation by that structure must differ from 
that of the surrounding tissues. The difference in 
signal between the body structure and its surroundings 
is frequently termed contrast and much effort has been 
devoted to means of enhancing contrast in diagnostic 
imaging since the greater the contrast between a body 
structure and its surroundings the higher the quality of 
the images and the greater their value to the physician 
performing the diagnosis. Moreover, the greater the 
contrast the smaller the body structures that may be 
visualized in the imaging procedure, i.e. increased 
contrast can lead to increased spatial resolution. The diagnostic quality of images is strongly 
dependent on the inherent noise level in the imaging 
procedure - and the ratio of the contrast level to the 
noise level can thus be seen to represent an effective 
diagnostic quality factor for diagnostic images. Achieving improvement in such a diagnostic quality 
factor has long been and still remains an important 
goal. In techniques such as X-ray and ultrasound, one 
approach to improving the diagnostic quality factor has 
been to introduce contrast enhancing materials, contrast 
agents, into the body region being imaged. Thus in X-ray for example early examples of 
contrast agents were insoluble inorganic barium salts  
 
which enhanced X-ray attenuation in the body zones into 
which they distributed. More recently the field of X-ray 
contrast agents has been dominated by soluble iodine 
containing compounds such as those marketed by Nycomed 
AS under the trade names Omnipaque and Amipaque. Much recent work on X-ray contrast agents has 
concentrated on aminopolycarboxylic acid (APCA) chelates 
of heavy metal ions and, recognising that effective 
imaging of many body sites requires localization at the 
body sites in question of relatively high concentrations 
of the metal ions, there have been suggestions that 
polychelants, that is substances possessing more than 
one separate chelant moiety, might be used to achieve 
this. However we have now found that contrast
