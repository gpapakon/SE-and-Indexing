<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a monophosphonite and/or diphosphonite in polyolefin 
compositions for enhancing the optical properties of these polyolefin compositions. Transparency in polymers is often a highly desirable property, for example in films. It 
is naturally desirable to use relatively cheap polymers for films and the like, but many 
of these cheaper polymers, as produced by known methods are not sufficiently 
transparent. As a result, when transparency is desired, relatively expensive polymers 
such as polyesters are used. Furthermore, it has been possible to clarify some inherently hazy polymers and therefore 
obtain good transparency by adding clarifiers prior to processing. Examples of such 
clarifiers are dibenzylidene sorbitol compounds, organic phosphates and salts of 
carboxylic acids. However, such clarifiers can result in undesired discoloration and 
evolution of unpleasant smell during processing. Surprisingly it has been found that using phosphonites (optionally with phosphites) can 
markedly enhance the transparency of polyolefins such as polypropylene. According to the invention, there is provided a composition for improving optical 
properties, especially for alleviating (i.e. improving) the haze of a polyolefin composition, 
the said haze improving composition (hereinafter referred to as the haze improving 
composition) comprising 
a) a monophosphonite and/or diphosphonite (hereinafter defined as component a) 
and optionally b) a phosphite (hereinafter defined as component b). Further according to the invention there is provided a method for improving the optical  
 
properties, especially for alleviating (i.e. improving) the haze of a polyolefin composition 
comprising applying an effective amount of a haze-improving composition (hereinafter 
defined as the haze improving composition) comprising 
a) a monophosphonite and/or diphosphonite (hereinafter defined as component a) 
and optionally b) a phosphite (hereinafter defined as component b). Still further according to the invention there is provided the use of a monophosphonite 
and/or diphosphonite (hereinafter defined as component a) and optionally phosphite 
(hereinafter defined as component b) for alleviating haze in polyolefin compositions such 
as polypropylene or polyethylene. This also preferably improves the 
clarity of the polymer. Preferably in a haze-improving composition both phosphonite and phosphite are present. Preferably the amount of haze improving composition applied is from 0.01 to 5%, more 
preferab
