The present invention relates to oxazolidinone derivatives possessing a substituted diazine
moiety bonded to an N-aryl ring, and to their use as antimicrobial agents.WO-A-90/02744 discloses 5'-indolinyl-5β-amidomethyloxazolidinones, 3-(fused-ring
substituted)phenyl-5β-amidomethyloxazolidinones, and 3-(nitrogen-substituted)phenyl-5β-amidomethyloxazolidinones
which are useful as antibacterial agents.Other references disclosing various oxazolidinones include US-A-4801600; US-A-4921869;

Chem. 35:1156(1992).EP-A-0352781 discloses phenyl and pyridyl-substituted phenyl oxazolidinones. EP-A-0316594
discloses 3-substituted styryl oxazolidinones. EP-A-0312000 discloses phenylmethyl
and pyridinylmethyl-substituted phenyl oxazolidinones.According to a first aspect of the present invention, novel compounds are of formula I
as defined in claim 1. Preferred embodiments are given in claims 2 to 10.According to a second aspect of the invention, novel compounds are as defined in claim
11, i.e. the compounds of Examples 10, 11, 12, 16, 22, 28, 29 and 40.Compounds of the invention (other than those in which Y is H) may be used for the
manufacture of a medicament for use in treating a microbial infection. More specifically, such
compounds are effective against a number of human and veterinary pathogens, including
multiply-resistant Staphylococci and Steptococci, as well as anaerobic organisms such as
Bacteriodes and Clostridia species, and acid-fast organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis
and Mycobacterium avium. The compounds are particularly useful because they are effective
against the latter organisms which are known to be responsible for infection in persons with
AIDS. Preferably, the compound is administered in an amount of from 0.1 to 100 mg/kg of
body weight/day, and more preferably from 3.0 to 50 mg/kg of body weight/day.With respect to the definitions herein, C1-6 or C1-12 alkyl is methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl,
pentyl, hexyl, etc. and isomeric forms thereof.Cycloalkyl is of three to twelve carbon atoms forming cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl,
cyclopenyl, cyclohexyl, etc. and isomeric forms thereof.Alkoxy is of one to six carbon atoms including methoxy, ethoxy, butyloxy, etc. and
isomeric forms thereof. Further, in some instances, groups are described as an alkoxycarbonyl
which are named in the compound's nomenclature as an alkyl ester (such as
