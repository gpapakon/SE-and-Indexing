<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmitting 
apparatus and a receiving apparatus of widescreen television 
signals capable of transmitting picture of a larger aspect 
ratio at high picture quality as compared with the existing 
television, while keeping compatibility with the existing 
television broadcast, within the transmission band used in 
the existing television broadcast. The existing color television broadcast in Japan runs 
on the specification of 525 scanning lines, 2:1 interlaced 
scanning, luminance signal horizontal bandwidth of 4.2 MHz 
and aspect ratio of 4:3, and more than 40 years have passed 
since it was put in commercial use. In this period, along 
with the request for high definition screen and advancement 
of performance of television receiver, various new 
television systems have been proposed. In this background, 
widescreen TV broadcasting systems featuring a wide screen  
 
while keeping compatibility with the existing broadcasting 
have been proposed. One of them is known as letterbox 
system proposed by Lippman et al. in "Single-channel 
Backward-compatible EDTV Systems" (SMPTE J. pp. 14-19, Jan. 
1989), in which the number of effective scanning lines is 
compressed from 480 lines to 360 lines per frame (240 lines 
to 180 lines per field), and the black portions are left 
over in the top and bottom (called upper and bottom panel). 
As a result, the aspect ratio is 16:9, but the vertical 
resolution is lowered, which is compensated by transmitting 
vertical high frequency component in the upper and bottom 
panel as helper signal. Besides, in the case of using the signal source by 
sequential scanning of 1:1, it is also considered to 
transmit horizontal scanning line difference signal 
generated when converting into 2:1 interlaced scanning as a 
vertical temporal helper signal additionally in the upper 
and bottom panel. This conversion from sequential to 
interlaced scanning is particularly known by the method 
using so-called SSKF disclosed by D.Gall and A. Tabatabai in 
"Sub-band Coding of Digital Images Using Symmetric Short 
Kernel Filters and Arithmetic Coding Techniques" (IEEE Proc. 
ICASPP, pp. 761-764, 1988). In the example shown in Fig. 9,  
 
using this SSKF, the signals decimated one out of two by 
passing through a vertical low pass filter of five taps of 
which coefficients are -1/8, 1/4, 3/4, 1/4, and -1/8 from 
the original signals of sequential scanning are transmitted 
as principal screen, and the signal decimated one out of two 
by passing through a
