<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spatial light modulator
system. The invention has particular, although not
exclusive relevance to this a spatial light modulator
system for use in a projection system in which a
projected display is formed by modulating light from a
light source by a spatial light modulator device, and
then projecting the modulated light on to a display area
in which beams having different color content are
modulated by different spatial light modulator devices
each driven in accordance with a different video signal,
and the modulated beams are combined to form a single
projected color display.A spatial light modulator is an optical component which
is controllable to modulate an incident light beam. A
relatively old example of such a spatial light modulator
is the eidophor, a layer of oil scanned by a cathode
ray. A more recent example of spatial light modulators
is an active matrix device, comprising a matrix of
individually addressed pixel light valves or modulators;
the liquid crystal modulator array described in, for
example, EP 0401912 is one modulator array of this type.
In EP 0401912, a liquid crystal matrix is provided in a 
light path to transmit in a variable manner , and hence
amplitude modulate, an incident light beam (without
altering its path or optical axis). Another example of
an active matrix device is the tiltable mirror array, the
so called "deformable mirror device" described in, for
example, US 4856863, US 4615595, and US 4596992.Such deformable mirror devices comprise an array of
miniature mirrored cantilever beam elements each carrying
electrodes so as to be electro statically deflectable
between two positions. The extent of the deflection can
be controlled by the applied electrostatic potential to
provide variable degrees of reflection, or the device
can be operated in a binary manner by applying
predetermined electrostatic potentials to switch between
discrete deflection states. Each element thus angularly
deflects the incident light beam and hence changes the
optical axis of the light beam.By using an array of such elements, each individually
addressable, a two dimensional image can be reproduced by
exposing the array to an incident light beam, modulating
the incident beam by controlling the individual mirror
devices from a picture signal, and collating the beam
reflected in a particular direction. The small size and 
fast switching times of such deformable mirror devices
makes them usable at video picture data rates, enabling
the display of television or video

<CLAIMS>
A spatial light modulator system comprising: a multi
wavelength light source (16); a plurality of spatial

light modulators (20a, 20b, 20c); a plurality of dichroic
mirror elements (18a, 18b) arranged in the light path

between the light source (16) and the spatial light
modulators (20a, 20b, 20c) so as to direct light within

a different wavelength band onto each of the spatial
light modulators (20a, 20b, 20c) and to combine the

modulated light from the spatial light modulators,
the spatial light

modulators being tiltable mirror devices, and
said

system being characterised in that
it includes

a further reflective means (100) provided in the optical
path from one of the tiltable mirror devices (20b) in

order to equalise the number of reflections undergone by
modulated light from the tiltable mirror devices (20a,

20b, 20c). 
A system according to claim 1 in which there are
three tiltable mirror devices (20a, 20b, 20c) and two

dichroic mirror elements (18a, 18b).
A system according to either of the preceding
claims, in which each dichroic mirror element (18a, 18b)

is provided on an optically transmissive component (30b,
30a) positioned in said light path and in which the

optically transmissive components (30b, 30a) are angled

with respect to the optical axis of the system so as to 
introduce at least one of spherical distortion and

astigmatism into the modulated combined beam, the system
further including at least one transmissive component

(110) of optical characteristics and set at an angle with
respect to the optical axis of the system so as to at

least partially cancel said distortion in at least one
of said optically transmissive component (30b, 30a).
A system according to claim 3, in which there are
three transmissive components (30b, 30a, 110) each of

equal optical path length, and angled with respect to the
optical axis of the system so as mutually to compensate

for distortions produced by the transmissive elements
(30b, 30a, 110).
A display system incorporating a spatial light
modulator system according to any one of the preceding

claims and a display screen (40).
