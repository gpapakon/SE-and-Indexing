<ABSTRACT>
The condom comprises an elongate sheath (1) made of an elastomeric, film-like material, and a tensioning ring (4) at its opening (3). The tensioning ring is intended to overcome impaired potency. The condom is applied using an aid (5) which is essentially shaped like a cone. This is accompanied by a rigid ring (6) which fits on to the base of the conical part and has a groove (8) on which the tensioning ring (4) can be pretensioned before use of the condom.
