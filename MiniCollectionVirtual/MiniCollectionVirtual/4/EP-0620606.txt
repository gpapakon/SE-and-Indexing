<ABSTRACT>
An electrode for a rechargeable battery with a 
nonaqueous electrolyte is provided wherein the active 

material layer has a sufficient flexibility, the adhesion 
between the active material coating and the metal foil 

collector is good, none of peeling, falling, cracking and 
other unfavorable phenomena occur in the active material 

coating in the step of assembling a battery and excellent 
discharge characteristics can be developed. The 

electrode for a rechargeable battery with a nonaqueous 
electrolyte comprises a metal foil collector and, formed 

on at least a part of the metal foil collector, an active 
material layer comprising an active material and a cured 

reaction-curing binder as essential components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rechargeable battery comprising an electrode
and a nonaqueous liquid electrolyte comprising an aprotic organic
solvent and a process for producing an electrode for a rechargeable battery.More particularly, it is
concerned with an electrode for a rechargeable battery
with a nonaqueous electrolyte, which causes none of
peeling, falling, cracking and other unfavorable
phenomena in an active material coating in the step of
assembling a battery and other steps and can develop
excellent discharge characteristics, and a process for
producing the same.A rapid advance of a reduction in size and a
reduction in weight of electronic equipment and
communication equipment in recent years has led to a
demand for a reduction in size and a reduction in weight
of rechargeable batteries used as a driving power source
in these equipments, and rechargeable batteries with a
nonaqueous electrolyte represented by lithium ion
rechargeable batteries having a high energy density and a
high voltage have been substituted for alkaline
batteries.In electrode sheets (plates) having a large effect
on the performance of the rechargeable batteries, an
attempt to increase the area has been made by reducing
the thickness of the electrodes for the purpose of
increasing the current density.In order to meet the above demands, for example,
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10466/1988 and Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 285262/1991 propose an electrode for
a positive electrode. This electrode is produced by
adding a conductive agent, a binder and optionally
suitable additives, such as a wetting agent, to a powder 
of an active material for a positive electrode, such as a
metal oxide, a sulfide or a halide, to prepare an active
material coating agent in a paste form and forming a
coating of the active material coating agent, that is, an
active material coating, on a metal foil collector.In the electrode comprising a metal foil collector
and, formed thereon, a coating comprising an active
material coating agent, that is, an active material
coating, the binder for the active material coating agent
should be electrochemically stable against nonaqueous
electrolytes, particularly against organic solvents,
should not be eluted into the electrolytes and should
have a flexibility enough to cause none of peeling,
falling, cracking and other unfavorable phenomena in the
step of assembling a battery using the active material
coating and an excellent adhesion to the metal foil
collector.In the conventional electrode comprising a
