<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the use of a pre-alloyed powder as a binder in the manufacture of diamond tools by hot sintering. This powder is characterized in that it has an average particle size of less than 10  mu m as measured with the Fisher SSS and loss of mass by reduction in hydrogen of less than 2 % as measured according to the standard ISO 4491-2:1989 and in that it contains, in % by weight, up to 40 % of cobalt, up to 50 % of nickel, from 5 to 80 % of iron and from 5 to 80 % of copper; the other components in the powder consist of unavoidable impurities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a pre-alloyed powder
as a binder in the manufacture of diamond tools by hot sintering.In the manufacture of diamond tools by hot sintering, with or
without pressure applied, of an intimate mixture of diamonds and
of a binder material, use is made for the binder phase, that is
the material forming the matrix of the tool after the sintering
operation, either of fine cobalt powders (from less than 1 to
about 6 µm in diameter as measured with the Fisher Sub Sieve
Sizer, called hereafter Fisher SSS) or of mixtures of fine
powders, such as mixtures of fine cobalt, nickel and iron powders,
or of coarse pre-alloyed powders, such as steel powders obtained
by atomization of a melt.
The use of fine cobalt powder gives very good results from a
technical standpoint; its major drawback stems from the high price
fluctuations of the cobalt powder.
Using mixtures of fine powders, matrices are obtained whose
strength, hardness and wear resistance are relatively low.
The use of coarse pre-alloyed powders (from 10 to 50 µm) requires
high sintering temperatures, in the order of 1000 to 1300 °C, at
which temperatures severe degradation of the diamonds takes place,
resulting in weakened diamond crystals and poor retention of the
diamonds in the matrix.
In SU-A-1689053 an iron-based metallic binder for diamond tools
with improved tool performance, and containing Ni, Cu and C and
Sn, is described. No specifications are given concerning the
preparation of the binder and the characteristics of the powders
involved.The object of the present invention is to provide fine pre-alloyed
powders, containing copper and iron as two of the alloying
elements, and with less or no dependence on cobalt, whose use as a
binder in the manufacture of diamond tools by hot sintering avoids
the aforementioned drawbacks.For this purpose, the new pre-alloyed powder used according to the
invention has an average particle size of less than 10 µm, as 
measured with the Fisher SSS, and a loss of mass by reduction in
hydrogen of less than 2 %, as measured according to the standard
ISO 4491-2:1989. The powder comprises, in % by weight, up to 40 %
of cobalt, up to 50 % of nickel, from 5 to 80 % of iron and from 5
to 80 % of copper, the balance of the powder consisting
of unavoidable impurities. It has been found that such a powder
may be sintered at moderate temperatures, i.e. from 600 to 1000
°C, giving a high hardness and a good resilience, which may be
adapted to the particular requirements of the users of
