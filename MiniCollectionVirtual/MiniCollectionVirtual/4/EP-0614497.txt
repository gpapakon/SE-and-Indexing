<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a device for treating a wafer of semiconductor material at a determined temperature with gas and/or vapour, comprising: a supply lock (7) for supplying a wafer (W) of semiconductor material; a treatment space (9) in which a wafer of semiconductor material can be placed via the supply lock; a gas inlet (13) for admitting gas and/or vapour into the treatment space; pump means for bringing the treatment space to and holding it at underpressure, and a table part (11) for supporting the wafer of semiconductor material having a mass relative to the surrounding parts such that during treatment an approximately constant temperature prevails in the treatment space.

<DESCRIPTION>
Arranging an image on the top surface of resist 
material is becoming increasingly popular and is known as 
Top Surface Imaging (TSI), as for instance the DesireR 
process described in Proceedings SPIE 631, page 34 (1986) 
by F. Coopmans and B. Roland. In addition to dry 
developing of the image, which must take place rapidly 
and anisotropically, the depositing of a silylation agent 
such as hexamethyldisilazane or trimethyldisilazane is 
also important. This must take place in a properly 
uniform manner while depth and profile of the indifusion 
of this silylation agent must be precisely determined. 
Further information cn be obtained from the above article. In such processes the problem occurs that the 
temperature in a reactor in which such a process has to 
take place is difficult to keep constant. So called hot 
spots are to be avoided and atmospheric influence is to 
be minimised. US-A-5,060,354 discloses a heated plate rapid 
thermal processor, which is suitable for treating wafers. The present invention provides a method for 
treating a wafer of semiconductor material at a 
predetermined temperature with gas and/or vapour, 
comprising: 
supplying a wafer of semiconductor material 
in a supply lock; placing the wafer of semiconductor material 
in a treatment space via the supply lock; admitting gas and/or vapour into the 
treatment space through a gas inlet;  
 bringing the treatment space to and holding 
it at underpressure by pump means; and heating the wafer of semiconductor material 
by heating means provided to a table part for supporting 
said wafer, wherein a temperature stability within 1째C is 
obtained in a temperature range of 30 - 250째C as the 
table part has a high mass and a heat capacity at least 
two orders of magnitude larger than a semiconductor wafer 
and wherein the gas is supplied through the underside of 
the table part and the pump means are connected through 
the upper wall of said apparatus, substantially opposite 
the gas supply and above said table part. The gas inlet is situated on the rear side of 
the wafer of the semiconductor to be positioned so that 
there is no possibility that liquid droplets can form on 
the front side of the wafer of semiconductor material; 
further more the pump connection opposite the gas inlet 
provides for a uniform flow along the underside of the 
wafer, around the perifery thereof and along the 
upperside thereof, providing for an uniform progression 
of isotherms in the threatment space. Further the present invention provides an 
apparat
