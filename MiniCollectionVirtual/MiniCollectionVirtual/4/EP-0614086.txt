<ABSTRACT>
A velocity information detecting apparatus 
detects velocity information of a moving object. The 

apparatus is provided with a light source for emitting 
a coherent beam, a beam splitting member for splitting 

the beam from the light source into a plurality of 
beams to irradiate the object thereby, and a 

photodetector for receiving scattered light from the 
object. The velocity information of the object is 

detected, based on a Doppler shift of the scattered 
light detected by the photodetector. The plurality of 

beams irradiate the object disposed in a region before 
the plurality of beams are spatially separated from 

each other. The beam splitting member may be either a 
diffraction grating or a prism member. The diffraction 

grating may be a lamellar phase grating or a blazed 
diffraction grating. The prism member may be a roof 

prism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a velocity 
information detecting apparatus for optically detecting 
information about velocity of relative motion of an 
object. An optical Doppler velocity measuring apparatus 
has been used heretofore for precisely measuring a 
velocity for example of a rotary drum in a video 
recorder. Various optical heads of inch size have been 
developed according to a recent demand of 
miniaturization. Fig. 1 is a drawing of optical arrangement to 
show a conventional laser Doppler velocity sensor. A collimated beam R emitted from a wavelength 
stabilized gas laser 1' (wavelength λ) is split by a 
half mirror HM into two beams R+1 and R-1. The optical 
axes of principal rays of the beams are bent by 
respective mirrors M1, M2, and the beams impinge at 
incident angles + and - at a same point on an object 
L relatively moving at velocity v. A beam R' scattered from the object and 
including Doppler signal light is guided toward a light 
receiving element 6. The light receiving element 6  
  
 
outputs a signal containing a component with a 
frequency being a Doppler frequency f as defined by the 
following formula, which is included in the scattered 
light. 
f=(2·v·sin)/λ  
A moving velocity of the object can be known by 
extracting a necessary frequency signal band by a 
suitable frequency discriminator and counting the 
frequency of the periodic signal. EP-A-0 548 848, which comprises state of the art 
according to Article 54(3) EPC, describes a 
laser Doppler velocity sensor in which a coherent 
beam from a light source is splitted by a first 
grating into two spatially separated beam components 
which are made to converge on the object, whose 
velocity is to be determined, by passing through a second grating. The recent demand becomes stronger to obtain a 
further miniaturized velocity meter. In order to 
further miniaturize the optical heads down to the 
millimeter size, new ideas must be introduced for the 
optical paths or optical systems. It is a primary object of the present invention 
to provide a velocity information detecting apparatus 
which can be composed of a less number of optical 
components in a simplified arrangement, enabling 
further miniaturization. Other objects of the present invention will be 
apparent in the following description of embodiments. Fig. 1 is an explanatory drawing to show a 
conventional example;  
 Fig. 2A is an explanatory drawing to illustrate 
the principle of a laser Doppler velocity meter in a 
first embodiment of the present
