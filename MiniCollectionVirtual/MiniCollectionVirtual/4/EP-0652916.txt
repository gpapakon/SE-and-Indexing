<ABSTRACT>
Claimed is the use of alkali alkylbenzenesulphonates with up to 18 C-atoms in the alkyl group as thinners in aqueous adhesives. Compared with naphthalenesulphonates, such alkali alkylbenzenesulphonates are easy to produce and are, above all, readily biodegradable, yet have equally good viscosity-control properties.

<CLAIMS>
The use of alkali metal, ammonium and/or alkaline earth metal alkyl
benzene sulfonates containing up to 4 C atoms in the alkyl group as liquifying

agents in water-containing adhesives based on casein, dextrin and polyvinyl
acetate, no nitrates being used as additional liquifying agents.
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized by the propyl radical.
The use claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized by sodium as the alkali
metal.
The use claimed in at least one of claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized by
a concentration of the alkali metal alkyl benzene sulfonate of 0.5 to 30% by

weight and more particularly 15 to 25% by weight, based on the final solution.
The use claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 4, characterized by a
water-containing adhesive based on biodegradable high molecular weight

substances.
A water-based adhesive containing alkali metal, ammonium and/or
alkaline earth metal alkyl benzene sulfonates as liquifying agents according

to at least one of claims 1 to 5.
