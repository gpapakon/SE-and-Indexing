<ABSTRACT>
A strip line cable is provided comprising a dielectric (1) in 
tape form made of a porous, crystalline polymer and one or 

more pairs of electrical conductors (such as 2a,2a′) each pair 
of conductors having a first conductor located on one side of 

the tape and the other conductor located on the opposite side 
of said tape and in substantially parallel relationship to the 

first conductor of the pair. The pairs of conductors are 
arranged in substantially parallel transverse relationship 

across said tape, and insulating layers (3, 3′) made of a suit­
able non-porous plastic material are placed over the conduc­

tors to affix them to said dielectric tape and encapsulate the 
cable assembly. The preferred tape dielectric is expanded, 

porous polytetrafluoroethylene.
