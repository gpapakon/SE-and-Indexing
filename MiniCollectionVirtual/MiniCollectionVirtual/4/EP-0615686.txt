<ABSTRACT>
A device for raising aquarium fish is a combination of 
a water tank (1) and a receptacle assembly (4). The water tank 

(1) has an upper opening, a lid (L) for closing the upper 
opening and provided with an illumination mechanism and a 

filtration mechanism, and a fastening portion (3c). The 
receptacle assembly (4) is for supplying electricity to the 

illumination and filtration mechanisms and has a fastened portion 
(7) for engagement with the fastening portion (3c) of the water 

tank (1). The receptacle assembly (4) includes an assembly 
body (4a) open at one side, accommodating a plurality of 

receptacles (9) therein and having a receptacle cover (10) 
disposed inside the assembly body (4a) at a position spaced 

a predetermined distance from the open side of the assembly 
body (4a) for positioning and fixing the plurality of receptacles 

(9), and an assembly holder (7) having a lateral wall portion 
(7a) attached to the assembly body (4a) and a vertical wall 

portion (7b) extending from the lateral wall portion (7a) toward 
the open side of the assembly body (4a) at a distance from the 

assembly body (4a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a receptacle assembly
for a device for raising aquarium fish, including
tropical fish.Generally, conventional devices for raising aquarium fish
comprise a water tank having an upper opening, a lid for
covering the upper opening of the water tank, an
illumination mechanism and a filtration mechanism. Two
such mechanisms are provided on the lid or used in cooperation
with each other as a lid, and supplied with
electricity via their respective electric cords connected
through plugs to a wall socket having its slots directed
sideways or a floor sockect having its slots directed
upward. Since the electric cords extend to the wall or
floor socket, they detract from the appearance of the
water tank surroundings. Furthermore, since the wall or
floor socket is disposed in the vicinity of the water
tank, with its slots directed sideways or upward, there
is a possibility of water drops splashing or falling from
the water tank or the owner's hands onto the socket when
the lid is opened for feeding the aquarium fish or during
cleaning of the water tank. This may cause a short circuit. GB-A-1,497,393 discloses a receptacle assembly suitable
for use with devices for raising aquarium fish. This
device has a number of electrical receptacles located in
an assembly body and means for supporting the assembly
body. Sideways directed slots are provided for the entry
of electric cords.The present invention has been proposed to solve or
alleviate the problems mentioned above.One object of the present invention is to provide a
device for raising aquarium fish, which makes its
surroundings neat and protects it from short circuiting
by water.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
receptacle assembly for the device, which enables
prevention of short circuiting by water.According to the present invention, there is provided a
receptacle assembly for a device for raising aquarium
fish, comprising an assembly body accommodating a
plurality of electrical receptacles therein and support means for
supporting the assembly body in an operative position,
said receptacle assembly being characterised in that: 
said assembly body opens at one side and has a receptacle
cover disposed inside said assembly body at a position
spaced a predetermined distance from the open side for
positioning and fixing the electrical receptacles,said support means is a substantially L-shaped assembly
holder comprising a lateral wall portion attached to a
side of the assembly body opposite the open side and a
vertica
