<ABSTRACT>
The pipe-coupling device for a corrugated-roll cassette within a simple face station comprises a first plate (30) integral with the cassette (10) in which sockets or plugs (50) are mounted. Each socket or plug is connected via a rigid conduit (4, 5, 6, 7) in the cassette to a connector (92) located at the level of the roll journals. The plate is oriented in the sense of insertion displacement of the cassette in the working position. A second plate (40) integral with the frame (20) is oriented opposite the first plate. Complementary sockets or plugs (60) connected to rigid supply or discharge conduits (1, 2, 8, 9) of the pipe are mounted in this second plate.

Conduit connection device for a cassette containing fluted 
cylinders used in a "single-face" station, characterized by the fact that the 

said device includes a first plate (30) that is secured to the cassette (10) 
and is provided with sockets or p
lugs (50), each of which being linked in the 
cassette by means of a duct (4, 5, 6, 7) to a connector (92) located at the 

level of the trunnions of the cylinders, this plate being orientated in the 
traveling direction of insertion of the cassette in operative position, as well 

as a second plate (40) that is secured to the frame (20) and is orientated 
opposite the first plate, the latter second plate being provided with 

complementary sockets or plugs (60) which are linked to inlet or outlet 
ducts (1, 2, 8, 9) of the conduit. 
Connection device according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that a plug (50) has a tubular nose (54) with a chamfered outer front 

edge, a periphery of the latter nose engages the inner duct of a socket (60), 
the length of the nose being at least half its outer diameter. 
Connection device according to claim 2, characterized by the 
fact that a ring-shaped seal (64) is set in a groove arranged crosswise to 

the inlet of the inner duct of a socket (60). 
Connection device according to one of the aforesaid claims, 
characterized by the fact that the first plate (30) is supported by a bracket 

(12, 14) on the outer side of the cassette (10) opposite a lateral side of the 
frame (20). 
Connection device according to claim 4, characterized by the 
fact that the second plate (40) is held at a position away from the lateral 

side of the frame (20) by a foot (22). 
Connection device according to one of the claims 2 to 5, 
characterized by the fact that the first plate (30) is completed with at least 

one centering tenon (32) having a tapered tip and a length being greater 
than the nose (54) of a plug (50), the latter tenon engaging in a centering 

orifice (46) arranged in correspondance in the second plate (40).  
 
Connection device according to claim 6, characterized by the 
fact that a switch actuated by one of the centering tenons (32) is located in 

the foot (22) in the vicinity of the centering orifice (46).
