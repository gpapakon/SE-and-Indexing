<ABSTRACT>
In order to measure radiation emitted from or the influence of radiation on an individual circuit board, which in use normaly is arranged in a rack in parallel to other circuit boards, all circuit boards being connected to a common backplane (3), the backplane (5) is modified in such a way that the connection (9) of a considered board (7) will be located on the opposite side of said backplane compared to the connections (5) of the other boards (1). The whole equipment is located in a shielded housing (11) except the considered circuit  board (7). Thus the radiation from the other circuit boards (1) will be shielded or attenuated and only the radiation from the considered circuit board (7) will contribute to the radiation field around the device. In the same way only this considered circuit board (7) will be sensitive to electromagnetic radiation arriving from the outside. The power supply of the device is preferably provided by power equipment located inside the shielded housing (11), such as a battery (15) as well as a direct voltage power adaption unit (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to measuring electromagnetic 
emission from component or circuit boards mounted in racks, i.e. 
in the usual way in parallel to each other with a common 
connection plane, on one side of which the connections to the 
boards are located. The invention also relates to measuring 
interference sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation coming 
from the outside in such an individual component or circuit 
board, i.e. the influence of the radiation on the signal 
transmission between the electronic circuits on the board and 
therefrom to the connections of the board in the connection 
plane. Authorities in different countries make ever harder demands on 
the amount of electromagnetic radiation which is allowed to be 
emitted by electronic equipment. Emission of electromagnetic 
radiation thus must be restricted as much as possible. For 
electronic equipment, in which several component or circuit 
boards are mounted in parallel in a common connection plane, 
there is for natural reasons particular difficulties in 
measuring the emitted radiation from each individual board. From the document AT & T Technologies, Technical Digest No. 73, 
January 1984, "Circuit Pack Adaptor for High-Speed Circuit 
Packs", it is, in the testing of electronic equipment previously 
known to mount an individual circuit board on the rear side of 
the backplane or connection plane conventionally used in a 
computer. This mounting of the individual board makes the 
conductors on the board accessible for connection to electric 
testing equipment. The device mentioned in this document can 
however not be used for the measurement of the electromagnetic 
radiation which is emitted from the circuit board connected at 
the rear side, since radiation emitted from this card is mixed 
with the radiation emitted from the other boards. Nor is this 
device suited to be used for testing the interference  
 
sensitivity of an individual board, since a possible fault 
appearing in the electronic device, as a whole, of which an 
individual board is a part, not securely can be traced to have 
appeared in this board. For measuring the emission from, and radiation effects on, an 
individual board a method and a device are provided, the more 
detailed characteristics of which appear from the appended 
independent claims. Thus a backplane or connection plane is used being principally 
of the kind disclosed in the document cited above. In addition 
however, all other component or circuit boards than that to be 
tested, are
