<ABSTRACT>
A caravan or accommodation trailer (1) which has a forwardly extending accommodation portion which tapers in both width and height along the length of a tapered portion (6) extending to a towing connection (4). Preferably a bed or beds are placed in the forward portion so that its or their feet ends are in the tapered end. A caravan (1) is produced which has improved wind resistance characteristics and an overall reduction in weight for the same accommodation space.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A CARAVANTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to caravans or trailers for accommodation purposes and more particularly to caravans which can be built to be of a lighter weight and to be of lesser wind resistance than existing caravans.With the general trend to smaller lower powered vehicles in the interests of fuel economy it is useful to be able to have a caravan which is lighter in weight than existing caravans and hence can be towed without being so much of a load behind the vehicle and with a lesser wind resistance. There is also some advantage in being able to reduce the length of a caravan to facilitate towing.It is desirable to maintain standards of accommodation in an accommodation module in such caravans while at the same time providing for improved wind resistance characteristics and reduction in towing weight.BACKGROUND ARTThe problem of providing a more aerodynamic body shape has been approached in several prior art caravans.German Patent No. DE3217970 provides a flexible cover with aerodynamic shaping to be placed at the front end of a caravan. This arrangement does not provide any extra useable space in the caravan nor does it provide any reduction in overall weight.United Kingdom Patent Specification No. GB 2 023 512 A provides aerodynamic shaping for trailers but does not give any indication of any reduction in weight of such a construction.German Patent Specification No. DE3321 306 provides an extension at the front of a caravan which can be used to store articles and provides reduced aerodynamic drag. This arrangement does not provide increased accommodation within the module nor is there any reduction in weight of the caravan as a whole. 

 United States Patent No. US 4,629,241 suggests a wedge shaped arrangement that can be placed above the cabin of a truck mainly for reduced wind resistance but there is a suggestion that such a arrangement can be used for accommodation. A liftable top is provided but this is for the purpose a aligning the top with the top of any load towed by the truck. The teaching here is of reduction of wind resistance but certainly no reduction in weight of the vehicle. The principles are also nor directly related to towable vehicles.European Patent No. EP 025 320 provides an add-on section which can be placed on the front of an existing caravan to provide increased accommodation space or a storage region. There is no reduction in the overall length or weight of a caravan using such an arrangement suggested and there is no reduction in height of the forward

CLAIMS:
1. A caravan comprising an accommodation module, ground engaging wheels on the accommodation module and a forwardly extending and tapering portion, the forwardly extending and tapering portion including at its apex a connection means to enable towing of the caravan, characterised by the accommodation module including a portion extending along substantially the length of the forwardly extending and tapering portion and tapering in width and height towards the apex of the forwardly extending and tapering portion.
2. A caravan as in claim 1 further including a chassis underneath the accommodation module with the forwardly extending and tapering portion being provided by an A-frame connected rigidly to the chassis and the accommodation module being mounted to both the A-frame and to the chassis.
3. A caravan as in claim 1 wherein the accommodation module has substantially the same taper in width as the forwardly extending and tapering portion.
4. A caravan as in claim 1 wherein the portion within the accommodation module which tapers from both side to side and from top to bottom includes at least one bed.
5. A caravan as in claim 1 wherein the accommodation module includes a roof portion and the roof portion is adapted to be lifted to provide more head room within that portion of the accommodation module.
6. A caravan as in claim 1 further including at least one window in the accommodation module.
7. A caravan substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
