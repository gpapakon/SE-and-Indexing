<ABSTRACT>
A method for administering biological agents to eggs is 
disclosed which comprises providing the agents in a 

particulate carrier and injecting the carrier into the air 
cells of the eggs. The egg is preferably maintained in a 

vertical position with the air cell on top to facilitate 
migration of the particulate carrier between the inner and 

outer membranes which define the air cell, to the lower end 
of the egg. The particulate carrier releases the biological 

agent to the surrounding fluid and blood vessels. In 
addition, the carrier is embodied in the bird upon hatching 

from the egg, and therefore is available to continue to 
release the biological agent to the bird posthatch. 
Also disclosed is a composition of polyester 

microparticles containing bioactive polypeptide agents and 
methods for preparing the composition and administering 

bioactive agents. The composition comprises biocompatible, 
biodegradable microparticles having a polyester matrix and 

from about 5% to about 25% by weight of a biologically 
active, water-soluble polypeptide dispersed throughout the 

matrix, the polypeptide selected fom the group consisting of 
growth hormone releasing factor, synthetic analogs of growth 

hormone releasing factor, and pharmacologically active 
fragments thereof. The method for preparing the composition 

includes dissolving polyester in an organic solvent; 
suspending a biologically active agent in the polyester 

solution; emulsifying the suspension into an aqueous medium 
in which the agent is insoluble and evaporating the solvent 

from the emulsion to produce microparticles. The method for 
administering a bioactive agent to an organism involves 

suspending the microparticles in a suitable liquid and 
injecting the organism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of methods for 
administering biological agents to birds, and particularly to 
administering agents to an egg prior to hatching. The 
present invention also relates to microparticle compositions 
useful in practicing the foregoing methods and in other 
methods of delivering materials to animals, as well as to 
processes for preparing such compositions. The desirability of injecting eggs has been recognized 
for some time. Initially, the purpose of injecting eggs was 
to prepare various vaccines using the egg as a growth medium 
for the vaccine. The vaccine was then harvested from the egg 
and used as desired. Egg injections have also been used in 
toxicology studies. More recently, a purpose has been to 
inject eggs for accomplishing some beneficial or therapeutic 
affect on the bird that will eventually hatch from the egg. 
One advantage of injecting the egg rather than the live bird 
is related to the ease of injection. Eggs can be kept 
immobile and handled rather efficiently in comparison to 
newborn or older birds. Furthermore, in addition to the 
mechanical ease of injecting eggs, there also appear to be 
certain therapeutic advantages in inoculating or otherwise 
treating embryos rather than live birds. These advantages 
have become particularly important in the poultry industry, 
e.g., for chickens and turkeys. Given the desirability of injecting eggs for the 
described and other purposes, several basic techniques have 
been attempted. These generally include either forcing 
fluids through the shell of an egg using some sort of 
pressurization system, or physically forming an opening in 
the shell of an egg and then adding the desired fluid. 
Injection using some type of needle arrangement has been one 
of the basic techniques for physically opening an egg for 
such purposes.  In the past, the desired fluids have been administered 
either to the air cell of the egg or directly into the yolk 
sac or amniotic fluid. Fluids delivered into the air cell 
simply pass through the inner membrane of the egg into nearby 
blood vessels. This approach has the advantage of not 
requiring that instruments be passed through the inner 
membrane, which would require sterile procedures and 
instruments. Delivery into the amniotic fluid also raises 
the risk that the injection device, commonly a needle, may 
injure or even destroy the live embryo. A further potential problem with administration of agents 
to a developing embryo relates to timing. Certain agents are 
optima

an injectable formulation adapted for injection into an egg 

including an outer membrane and an inner membrane with

a size and density to migrate through the fluid between the 

membranes to the end of the egg opposite to the air cell.
