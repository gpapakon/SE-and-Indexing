<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to hinged tools such as 
scissors, shears, pruners, or the like, having a force applying 

end with formed handles (20) and an opposed working end consisting of 
a pair of blades (12,14) disposed across a hinged joint (24) through 

which a 
force may be transmitted. In these tools the handles (20), which are 

formed integrally with the hinge (24), are provided with ridge support 
in the form of heel elements (26) to establish suitable contact 

between the blades (12,14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, generally, to hinged tools 
such as scissors, shears, pruners, and the like. More 
particularly, this invention is concerned with tools 
having a force applying end with formed handles, and an 
opposed working end disposed across a hinged joint 
through which a working force may be transmitted. In 
these tools, the hinge joint is an integral part of the 
handles, preferably constructed as a living hinge. 
Although it will become apparent from the following 
description that certain features of the present 
invention may be utilized in hinged tools of various 
construction for application to specific uses, for ease 
of understanding and convenience, the following 
description will from time to time specifically refer to 
a pair of scissors as the most preferred implementation 
of the present invention. Implements having elongated members disposed 
for cooperative engagement about a joint are widely used 
by those desiring to transmit a force through the joint 
to a working piece engaged by the working surfaces of the 
implement. In particular, tools such as scissors 
generally comprise two elongated members disposed for  
 
cooperative engagement about a pivotable joint. To 
facilitate operation of the implement by the user, 
handles conforming to the fingers or hands of the user 
are preferably molded onto the force applying end (also 
called tang) of each elongated member, or in the case of 
anvil-type implements, one of the elongated members is 
entirely typically made of molded material. As is well known, the joint in most of these 
implements commonly comprises a rivet or screw to 
maintain the members in suitable cooperative position, 
and washers when desired. Assembling such pivoted tools 
typically requires production personnel to bring 
apertures formed in the separately manufactured elongated 
members into registration to install the rivet or screw 
(and washers as necessary) to maintain those members in 
assembled relationship. In addition, to adjust the 
friction between the members to the desired amount, post-manufacturing 
finishing and adjusting operations are 
almost always required. It has been found, however, that pivoted 
implements having screws or rivets tend to lose their 
original factory adjustment due to mechanical wear in the 
joint during normal operation. This deficiency has 
already been recognized and addressed by those skilled in 
the art and more particularly by those skilled in the 
scissors art. For example, U.S. Patent No. 2,626,460 to

A hinged tool comprising: 

(a) a first and a second elongated member (12,14) each 
including a tang (18) and an opposed blade (16) having a 

cutting edge; 
(b) first and second handles (20) each including a 
force applying end (25) and an opposed tang receiving end (22), 

each of the tang receiving ends being molded into engagement 
with a respective one of the elongated members (12,14) at the 

tang (18) thereof; and 
(c) a hinge (24) formed integrally with both handles 
(20), and interconnecting the handles (20) at the tang 

receiving ends (22), characterized by means for forcing the 
blades (16) together 

generally in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the 
hinged tool 

to establish suitable contact between the 
cutting edges, wherein said forcing means includes a pair of 

oppositely facing, profiled heel elements (26), each heel 
element (26) extending inwardly from a respective one of the 

handles (20) by a predetermined distance, the heel elements 
(26) inter-engaging upon convergence of the handles (20) 

thereby producing forces on the heel elements (26) that in turn 
produce moments about the hinge (24) that force the blades (16) 

together to establish said contact between the cutting edges. 
The tool of claim 1, characterized in that each 
of the heel elements (26) includes an inner face spaced from an 

oppositely facing outer face by a distance which progressively 
decreases from the handle (20) to a distal end of the heel 

element, the inner faces inter-engaging upon convergence of the 
handles thereby developing said moments which vary 

progressively with the convergence of the handles. 
The tool of claim 1, characterized in that the 
heel element (26) of one of the handles (20) abuts against the 

other of the handles upon full convergence of the handles.  
 
The tool of claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that each of the handles (20) includes spaced apart 

inner (28) and outer surfaces and each of the heel elements 
(26) extends from the inner surface (28) of a respective 

one of the handles. 
The tool of claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that the heel element (26) of at least one of the 

handles (20) abuts against the inner surface of the 
other of the handles upon full convergence of the handles 

(20). 
The tool of claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that the inner surface (28) of each of the handles 

(20) further comprises a recess (30) and each of the 
heel elements (26) includes an abutmnet end at a distal 

end thereof, the abutment end of the heel element of at 
least one of the handles being seated in the recess of 

the other handle upon full convergence of the handles. 
The tool of claim 6, 
characterized
 
in that each of the heel elements (26) includes an inner 

face spaced from an oppositely facing outer face by a 
distance which progressively decreases to the abutment 

end (36). 
The tool of claim 7, 
characterized
 
in that the said profiles have an incline angle of 

approximately 1Â°. 
The tool of claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the heel elements (26) are substantially identical. 
The tool of claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that said predetermined distance is such 

that the heel elements (26) inter-engage over substantially 
the entire convergence of the handles (20). 
The tool of claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the heel elements (26) are substantially 

triangular-shaped.
