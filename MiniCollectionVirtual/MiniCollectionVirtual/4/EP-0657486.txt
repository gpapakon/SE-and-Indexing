polymerization degree of from 1 to 400 and containing at 

least one siloxane unit represented by formula (1): 

wherein R¹ represents an aliphatic straight-chain or branched 
hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or an alicyclic

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluorine-modified
silicone, a process for preparing the same, and cosmetics
containing the same. More particularly, it relates to a
novel fluorine-modified silicone having excellent water- and
oil-repellency, a process for preparing the same, and
cosmetics containing the same which wear long when applied to
the skin and have a good feel on use.Various types of water-repellent cosmetics are used
for protecting the skin from water or sweat or for preventing
makeup from getting disordered by water or sweat. For
example, cosmetics for foundation, such as creams and
lotions, and cosmetics for make-up usually contain silicone
oil or silicone resin as a water-repellent component. The
silicone oil or silicone resin is effective for water-repellency
oil-repellency. to some extent but does not have sufficient
Therefore, cosmetics containing these
ingredients still tend to get disordered on the skin due to
sebum.Hence, attempts have been made in various fields to
develop a compound which repels both water and oil. For
example, JP-A-2-295912 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means
an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") 
discloses that cosmetics containing fluorine-modified
silicone compounds, such as trifluoropropylsilicone, exhibits
excellent resistance to both water and sebum.A water- and oil-repellent base to be used in
cosmetics should satisfy all the requirements: (a) to have
sufficient repellency against sweat and sebum, (b) to have
excellent emulsion stability, (c) to withstand mechanical
contact (for example, when pressed with a handkerchief or a
tissue), and (d) to have a controlled viscosity to give a
good feel on application.However, the known fluorine-modified silicone
compounds do not sufficiently fulfill these requirements.
That is, they have poor emulsion stability due to poor
compatibility with general cosmetic bases, they easily come
away on contact with a handkerchief, a tissue, etc. due to
poor affinity to the skin, and they have poor spreadability
on application to the skin because of high viscosity.It has therefore been demanded to develop a compound
having excellent water- and oil-repellency which is stable
when incorporated into cosmetics, causes no disorder of
makeup while on the skin, and gives a satisfactory feel on
use.As a result of extensive investigations, the present
inventors have found that a fluorine-modified silicone
derivative having a specific branched perfluoroalkyl group 
exhibits not only excellent water- and oil-repellency but has
goo
