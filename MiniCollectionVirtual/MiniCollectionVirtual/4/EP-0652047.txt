<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for the separation of 
nitrogen and carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures by 

using a ceramic separating material. The ceramic may be 
selected from sepiolite in the unmodified form, sepiolite 

which has been heat-treated, and sepiolite which has had 
part or the whole of the exchangeable cation thereof 

replaced with zinc ion and which has been subsequently 
subjected to a heat treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
separation of nitrogen and carbon dioxide by using a
ceramic material as a separating agent.Global warming has become a serious social issue. Since
the carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil
fuels at factories etc. is believed to be one of the main
causes of this problem, it is necessary to develop
technologies for recovering the carbon dioxide already
discharged into the atmosphere and fixing the recovered
carbon dioxide or for separating and recovering the
carbon dioxide present at high concentration and high
temperature in exhaust gases. Organic separating
materials cannot be used for the separation and recovery
of hot carbon dioxide because they are not sufficiently
resistant to heat. The development of a thermally stable
material for the separation of nitrogen and carbon
dioxide contained in hot exhaust gases produced at
stationary sources such as factories has become an urgent
necessity in many industries. Ceramic materials, which
are thermally stable by nature, are suitable candidates
for the separating material, although no ceramic
separating material has been proposed to date for use in
the separation and recovery of high-temperature carbon
dioxide entrained by the exhaust gas from a factory or
the like.Journal of Chromatography, vol. 77, no. 1, 1973, pp 109-118
(G. Manala and M. Taramasso, "Selective Adsorption
Properties of the Surfaces of Attapulgite and Sepiolite") 
discloses the use of unmodified sepiolite as the
stationary phase in gas-solid chromatography. In
particular this reference discloses the use of unmodified
sepiolite which has been packed into a column and
conditioned overnight at 200°C for separating oxygen,
nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane at -78°C; carbon
dioxide is eluted at room temperature.JP-A-4106236 discloses heating sepiolite in a crucible
at 400 to 800°C for 4.5 hours, and then treating the heat
treated sepiolite with copper ions in water. The
resultant product is used as an adsorbent for nitrogen
and sulfur compounds.JP-A-4035739 discloses the use of sepiolite which has
been treated with zinc ions in acidic suspension and then
neutralised with aqueous ammonia for removing offensive
odours, especially mercaptan from car exhausts,
industrial waste gases or cigarette smoke.According to one aspect of the present invention
therefore there is provided a method for the separation
of nitrogen and carbon dioxide characterised by the use
of a ceramic separating material selected from sepiolite
which has been
