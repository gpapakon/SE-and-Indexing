<ABSTRACT>
A column which is adjustable in length, for chairs or the like has a standing tube (1) and a pneumatic or hydropneumatic length adjustment element arranged therein, whose housing (4) is supported radially in the standing tube (1) and is guided displaceably in the direction of a common axis (3). A profile (24) to secure against rotation is mounted firmly, in particular by shrinking, on the housing (4), which profile has at least one radially projecting web (26) which extends parallel to the axis (3) and engages in a groove-like recess (30) in a guide (5) which is connected securely against rotation to the standing tube (1).

An adjustable-length column for chairs, tables or the like comprising 
an upright tube (1) and a pneumatic or hydropneumatic length-adjusting 

element arranged therein concentrically of a common central longitudinal 
axis (3), the housing (4) of which element is radially supported in a 

guide of the upright tube (1) and displaceably guided in the direction of 
the axis (3), and the piston rod (7) of which element is arrested, in the 

vicinity of its free end, on a bottom plate (9) of the upright tube (1) in 
the direction of the axis (3), the housing (4) being guided, by means of 

a non-circular-cylindrical and non-circular cross-section, displaceably in 
the direction of the axis (3) in a recess (29) suited in cross-section, 


characterized in that
 a profile (24) guarding against twisting separate 
from the housing (4) is fastened on the latter with at least one web (26) 

extending in parallel to the axis (3), the web being guided in an adapted 
groove-like recess (30) of the guide (guide bushing 5) which is non-rotatable 

in relation to the upright tube (1). 
A column according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the profile (24) 
guarding against twisting has an annular cylindrical section (25) with 

which the at least one web (26) is formed in one piece. 
A column according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the profile 
(24) guarding against twisting consists of aluminium or an aluminium 

alloy. 
A column according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
profile (24) guarding against twisting is an extrusion-molded part. 
A column according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
profile (24) guarding against twisting is connected with the housing (4) 

of the gas spring (2) by shrunk-on press fit. 
A column according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the 
at least one web (26) has flanks (27) which are about parallel to a  

 
radius (28) extending from the axis (3) through the web (26) and which 

bear against correspondingly suited contact surfaces (31) of the groove-like 
recess (30). 
A column according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the 
guide is formed by a guide bushing (5) separate from the upright tube 

(1), which guide bushing (5) is non-rotatably connected with the upright 
tube (1).
