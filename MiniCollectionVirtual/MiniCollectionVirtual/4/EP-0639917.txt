<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a both-face 
automatic original feeding apparatus wherein a 

plurality of originals having images on their first 
and second surfaces are successively supplied from an 

original stacking portion to a predetermined position 
for reading the original, and each original is 

reversely rotated through a switch-back path after the 
first surface of the original passes through the 

predetermined position, thereby supplying the original 
to the predetermined position again to direct the 

second surface of the original to the predetermined 
position. In such feeding apparatus, it is provided 

an introduction path for directing the original 
supplied from the original stacking portion to the 

predetermined position; a first discharge path for 
directing the original to the switch-back path after 

the original passes through the predetermined position; 
a reverse rotation path for directing the original 

from the switch-back path to the predetermined position; 
and a control means for controlling the apparatus in 

such a manner that a preceding original is switched 
back to convey it in the reverse rotation path while 

a succeeding original is being passed through the 
predetermined position, and, when a trailing end of the 

succeeding original leaves the predetermined position, 
a tip end of the preceding original reaches the 

predetermined position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a both-face automatic original
feeding apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 and a
method for feeding a plurality of originals according to the
preamble of claim 2. More
particularly, it relates to an automatic original
feeding apparatus which is incorporated into an image
forming apparatus such as a copying machine, a laser
beam printer and the like and in which a plurality of
originals having images on their both surfaces are
automatically and successively conveyed to a reading
position to read the images formed on both surfaces of
the originals.In automatic original feeding apparatuses
incorporated into an image forming apparatus such as a
copying machine, a plurality of originals are automatically
and successively sent to a reading position
to read images formed on the originals and the read
originals are successively discharged. In this case,
when the images to be read are formed on front and
back surfaces (i.e. first and second surfaces) of the
original, the original is reversely rotated (i.e. turned
up) so that the image formed on the first surface and
the image formed on the second surface can be automatically
read. The original having the images on its both
surfaces is firstly supplied from an original stacking
portion to a predetermined position, i.e. a reading
position for reading the original, thereby reading the
image formed on the first surface of the original.
In case of an original having an image on its first
surface alone, after the image formed on the first
surface is read, the original is then discharged from
the reading position. On the other hand, when the
original also has the image on its second surface,
after the image formed on the first surface is read,
the original is temporarily stored in a switch-back
path, for example. Then, the original is supplied to
the reading position again through a path (reverse
rotation path) different to a path through which the
original was sent to the switch-back path, thereby
reading the image formed on the second surface. After
the image formed on the second surface is read, the
original is discharged from the reading position. By
repeating the above-mentioned series of operations
(i.e. the operation for supplying the original to the
reading position to read the image on the first
surface, the operation for temporarily storing the
original in the switch-back path after the reading of
the first surface image, the operation for supplying
the original to the reading position again to read the
image on the
