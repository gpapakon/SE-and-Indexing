<ABSTRACT>
A contact lens which has a centrally located optical 
zone. The optical zone is subdivided into at least one distance 

area having at least one focal point and at least one reading 
area having at least a further focal point. The distance area 

is located exclusively in the uppermost portion and the reading 
area is located exclusively in the lowermost portion of the 

optical zone. The upper edge of the contact lens has a greater 
curvature than the two side edges thereof, so that the shape of 

the lens is oval having a larger vertical than horizontal 
dimension. 
Preferably, the lower edge of the contact lens has a 
less pronounced curvature than the upper edge thereof and can 

even have a less pronounced curvature than the side edges, 
specifically such that the curvature of the lower edge of the 

contact lens essentially corresponds to the curvature of the 
lower eyelid of the wearer. For the purposes of more accurate 

positioning of the contact lens, the thickness of the lens 
gradually increases from top to bottom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a contact lens which has a
centrally located optical zone, which is subdivided into at
least one distance area having a first focal point and at least
one reading area having a second focal point.A contact lens of this type is generally known.A known bifocal contact lens, which is available on a
small scale, has a curved shape which as far as possible
corresponds to the shape of the eye of the wearer. Seen from
the front, this contact lens is circular and is provided with
a concentric optical zone, which is subdivided into concentric
circular layers. In a bifocal lens, said concentric layers
have, turn and turn about, a first and a second focal point. In
these contact lenses the so-called diffractive or simultaneous
system is used, with which a first image, for example a distant
image, is formed by the layers having the first focal point
and, at the same time, a second image, for example the reading
image, is formed by the layers having the second focal point.
Said principle is based on the concept that people are capable
of separating these images in the brain and of concentrating on
one of the two images. When the contact lens wearer wishes to
see a distant object, he or she concentrates on the image of
said object. The image which this person discerns through the
layers having the second focal point is unsharp and blurred,
which could assist in concentrating on the first image. It
should be possible to apply the corresponding reasoning in the
case of a reading image.However, the known bifocal contact lens has the
disadvantage that losses in contrast arise, inter alia as a
consequence of the double images. Moreover, it has been found
that only a few people have the abovementioned ability to
separate images, with the result that acceptance of the known
bifocal lens in practice was highly disappointing.The aim of the invention is to provide a contact lens
of the type mentioned in the preamble, with which the
abovementioned disadvantages and problems are avoided. Further 
aims of the invention are the best possible contrast and as
high as possible a level of acceptance by lens wearers.The said objectives are achieved according to the
invention in that the distance area is located exclusively in
the uppermost portion and the reading area is located
exclusively in the lowermost portion of the optical zone and in
that the upper edge of the contact lens has a greater curvature
than the side edges thereof.This contact lens works in accordance with the so-called
alternating principle.

<CLAIMS>
Contact lens which has a centrally located optical zone,
which is subdivided into at least one distance area having at

least one focal point and at least one reading area having at
least a further focal point, characterised in that the

thickness of the lens gradually increases from one edge to the
opposite edge, by which in the eye said one edge is urged to be

the upper edge and the opposite edge the lower edge, and that
the upper edge of the contact lens has a greater curvature than

the side edges thereof.
Contact lens according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the lower edge of the contact lens has a smaller curvature

than the upper edge thereof.
Contact lens according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the curvature of the lower edge of the contact lens

essentially corresponds to the curvature of the lower eyelid of
the wearer.
Contact lens according to Claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that the lower edge of the contact lens is

provided with a thickening.
Contact lens according
to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that marker

points are provided close to the side edges of the contact lens
at a fixed distance above the lower edge thereof.
