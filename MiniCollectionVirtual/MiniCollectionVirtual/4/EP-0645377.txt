<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a squalene synthetase inhibitor which 
comprises the compound represented by the formula (I) 


wherein R₁ stands for H or an optionally substituted 
hydrocarbon group; R₂ and R₃ independently stand for H, 

an optionally substituted alkyl group, an optionally 
substituted phenyl group or an optionally substituted 

aromatic heterocyclic group; Z stands for a carbon 
chain containing a double bond or -Z'-C(OH)- (Z' stands 

for a bond or a straight-chain or branched alkylene chain); the symbol 

 stands for a double bond or a 
single bond; Y stands for an optionally esterified 

carboxyl group, an optionally substituted carbamoyl 
group, an optionally substituted hydroxyl group, an 

optionally substituted amino group or an optionally 
substituted heterocyclic radical having a protonizable 

hydrogen; and 
the ring A is optionally substituted, or a 

pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and which is 
useful for the prophylaxis or therapy of 

hypercholesteremia or coronary sclerosis of mammals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a condensed 7-membered 
cyclic compound or a salt thereof, and, to a squalene 
synthetase inhibitor comprising same as the effective 
component. Hypercholesteremia, high blood pressure and 
smoking are known as three major dangerous factors of 
causing ischemic heart diseases. Adequate control of 
cholesterol concentration in blood is remarkably 
important for the prophylaxis or therapy of, besides 
these ischemic heart diseases, as well as of coronary 
sclerosis. As pharmaceutical compositions for lowering 
cholesterol in blood, attention has been drawn to those 
for controlling the biosynthesis of cholesterol, 
besides those of inhibiting its absorption by binding 
bile acid including, among others, cholestyramine, 
colestipol (disclosed in, for example, USP 4027009), 
and those of suppressing the intestinal absorption of 
cholesterol by inhibiting acyl coenzyme A cholesterol 
acyl transferase (ACAT) including melinamide (disclosed 
in French Patent No.1476569). As pharmaceutical 
preparations for controlling the biosynthesis of 
cholesterol, lovastatin (disclosed in USP 4231938), 
simvastatin (disclosed in USP 4444784), pravastatin 
(USP 4346227), etc., which are capable of inhibiting 
especially 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA) 
reductase, are provided for medicinal use. 
However, when HMG-CoA reductase is inhibited, not only 
the biosynthesis of cholesterol but the biosynthesis of 
some other components such ubiquinone, dolichol and 
heme A, which are necessary for the living body, is 
also inhibited, so that occurrences of undesirable side  
 
effects to be caused thereby are feared. Squalene synthetase is an enzyme taking part in 
the essential step of new cholesterol biosynthetic 
route. And, this enzyme is an enzyme forming squalene 
catalyzing the reductive dimerization of two molecules 
of farnesyl pyrophosphoric acid. On the other hand, the compounds expected as 
inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting 
squalene synthetase are disclosed in Journal of 
Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 51, No. 10, pp.1869-1871,

No. H1-213288/1989(JPA H1(1989)-213288), JPA H2(1990)-101088,

and W09313096. And, various compounds showing antifungal action 
by inhibiting the synthesis of squalene have been known
