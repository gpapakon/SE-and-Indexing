<ABSTRACT>
A motor vehicle clutch control system for a motor vehicle having an electrical system including an ignition switch (70). The control system includes a hydraulic power circuit (30) including an electrically driven pump (33), an accumulator (35) and a clutch actuator (39), at least one sensor (71) for sensing a predetermined vehicle condition and a control unit (49) which controls the actuator in response to sensed conditions of the associated vehicle to operate an associated clutch (18). The control unit (49) causes the pump (33) to charge the accumulator (35) for subsequent operation of the actuator (39) when the imminent starting of the associated vehicle is sensed by the sensor (71) but prior to operation of the ignition switch (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
 A CLUTCH CONTROL SYSTEMThe present invention relates to a clutch control system for a motor vehicle.The applicant has developed a power hydraulic circuit for use in a clutch control system, and which comprises a reservoir of hydraulic fluid, an accumulator, a pump, and a control valve. Such a system is disclosed in WO 89/08786.The power hydraulic circuit is controlled by a control unit which is responsive to predetermined vehicle parameters to operate the friction clutch.A problem with such systems is that if the vehicle is left parked in gear, for example when left parked on a hill, and the hydraulic circuit accumulator discharges, then the driver may experience unacceptable delay as the accumulator charges before he is able to select 'neutral' in the gear box before starting the engine.This is particularly true where the clutch control system is of the type disclosed in GB application 92 19101.4 in which the engine start-up is prevented when the vehicle is in gear. 

The present invention seeks to overcome this problem.Accordingly there is provided a motor vehicle clutch control system for a motor vehicle having an electrical system including an ignition switch, the control system comprising a hydraulic power circuit including an electrically driven pump, an accumulator and a clutch actuator, at least one sensor for sensing a predetermined vehicle condition and a control unit which controls the actuator in response to sensed vehicle conditions to operate an associated clutch, wherein the control unit causes the pump to charge the accumulator for subsequent operation of the actuator when the imminent starting of the vehicle is sensed by said at least one sensor but prior to operation of the ignition switch.Preferably said at least one sensor senses either the presence of the driver in the vehicle, or the entry of the driver into the vehicle.Preferably the power hydraulic circuit has four operating conditions, an inert mode, a wake up-mode, a normal operating mode and a waiting mode, and the control unit selects the operating mode in response to sensed vehicle conditions . 

Conveniently wherein the power circuit is inert, when the ignition switch is off, the circuit goes to wake up mode when the "imminent starting" condition is sensed, and the circuit enters its normal operating mode when the ignition switch is turned-on.The invention will be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:Fig 1 is a diagrammatic illustration of a motor vehicle having a clutch

CLAIMS
1. A motor vehicle clutch control system for a motor vehicle having an electrical system including an ignition switch (70), the control system comprising a hydraulic power circuit (30) including an electrically driven pump (33), an accumulator (35) and a clutch actuator (39), at least one sensor (71) for sensing a predetermined vehicle condition and a control unit (49) which controls the actuator in response to sensed conditions of the associated vehicle to operate an associated clutch (18), the system being characterised in that the control unit (49) causes the pump (33) to charge the accumulator (35) for subsequent operation of the actuator (39) when the imminent starting of the associated vehicle is sensed by said at least one sensor (71) but prior to operation of the ignition switch (70).
2. A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that said at least one sensor (71) senses the presence of the driver in the associated vehicle. 


3. A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that said at least one sensor (71) senses entry into the associated vehicle.
4. A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in Claim 3 characterised in that said sensor (71) senses the condition of a locking system of the associated vehicle.
5. A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in Claim 3 characterised in that said sensor (71) comprises a door switch which senses at least the opening of a driver's door of the associated vehicle.
6. A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the hydraulic power circuit has four operating conditions, an inert mode (80), a wake-up mode (82), a normal operating mode (84) and a waiting mode (85), and the control unit selects the operating mode in response to sensed vehicle conditions.
7. A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in Claim 6 characterised in that the power circuit (30) goes from its inert mode (80) to its wake-up mode (82) when the "imminent starting" condition is sensed, and the circuit enters its normal operating mode (84) when 



 the ignition switch (70) is turned- on.
8. A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in Claim 7 characterised in that if, when in the wake-up mode (82), the control unit (49) does not receive another predetermined vehicle condition signal (83) within a predetermined time period the hydraulic power circuit is returned to its inert mode (80).
9. A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in any one of Claims 6 to 8 characterised in that in the wake-up mode (82) the control unit (49) senses (35a) the accumulator pressure and operates the pump (33) to charge the accumulator (35) if fluid pressure is below a predetermined value.

A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in any one of Claims 6 to 9 characterised in that entry into the normal operating mode (84) occurs on operation of the ignition switch (70) and when in the normal operating mode the control unit (49) senses accumulator pressure and causes the pump (33) to charge the accumulator (35) if said pressure falls below a predetermined value.
11. A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 10 characterised in that the waiting 


 mode (85) is entered on turning off of the ignition switch (70), the waiting mode being exited (88) to the inert (80) mode if the control unit (49) does not receive another predetermined vehicle condition signal (87) within a predetermined time period or on locking of the associated vehicle.

14. A motor vehicle clutch control system as claimed in claim 2 characterised in that the system sounds an alarm (73) and/or disables the hydraulic power circuit (30) if the presence of the driver is detected or the ignition switch (70) is turned-on when a door—locks— operating condition is sensed.

A motor vehicle clutch control system for a motor vehicle having an electrical system including an ignition switch (70), the control system comprising a hydraulic power circuit (30) including an electrically driven pump (33), an accumulator (35) and a clutch actuator (39), at least one sensor (71) for sensing a predetermined vehicle condition and a control unit (49) which controls the actuator (39) in response to sensed vehicle conditions, the control system being characterised in that the power circuit (30) has four operating conditions, an inert mode (80), a wake up mode (82), a normal operating mode (84) and a waiting mode (85), and the control unit selects the operating mode in response to a sensed vehicle condition.
