<ABSTRACT>
Using semiconductor switches which can be turned off, it is possible to control the alternating current flowing through a load using the phase-gating principle or the phase-chopping principle. However, it is necessary to operate with phase-gating for an inductive load and with phase-chopping for a capacitive load. A method and a device are intended to be created which allow no attention to be paid to the respective type of load. To this end, according to the invention, a test program is initiated first of all when the mains voltage is applied, by means of which the type of load is determined and, subsequently, phase-gating is used for an inductive load and phase-chopping for a capacitive and/or resistive load.

Method for controlling the alternating current in 
a load circuit with the aid of interruptible semiconductor 

switches which can operate in phase lag or phase 
lead, and in the case of which a control unit ensures 

that they are operated as a function of the load behaviour 
and, in the case of an inductive load, operate in 

phase lag, 
characterized in that
 when the mains voltage 
is applied, a test program is first initiated, in which 

at least one predetermined current pulse is applied to 
the connected load and the type of load is subsequently 

determined from the current or voltage behaviour of the 
load relative to this current pulse, and only then are 

the semiconductor switches enabled for a phase lag or 
phase lead corresponding to the load, and in that, in the 

case of a capacitive and/or resistive load, the semiconductor 
switches operate in phase lead. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the turn-off voltage which occurs across the load 

when the current pulse is turned off is tested and, if a 
predetermined limit value of the turn-off voltage is 

exceeded, the presence of an inductive load is signalled, 
and otherwise the presence of a capacitive and/or resistive 

load is signalled. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, after an inductive load has been 

determined, a current synchronization system which 
detects the zero crossing of the load current is turned 

on, and in that the semiconductor switches driven in 
phase lag are turned off at the zero crossing of the load  

 
current. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that, after a resistive and/or capacitive load has 

been determined, a voltage synchronization system which 
detects the zero crossing of the mains voltage is turned 

on, and in that the semiconductor switches operated in 
phase lead are turned on at the zero crossing of the AC 

voltage. 
Device for implementing the method according to 
one of Claims 1 to 4, with a controlled power section 

(1), containing interruptible semiconductive switches, 
for controlling by phase lag or phase lead the alternating 

current supplied to a load (2), with an operating 
unit (5) for switching on and for stipulating 
a control 
value, and with a control unit (3) for controlling the 

power section (1) in accordance with the control value 
and for automatic stipulation of a phase lag or phase 

lead corresponding to the load behaviour, an inductive 
load leading to a phase lag, 
characterized
 in that the 
control unit (3) is a programmed control unit which is 

programmed in such a way that, when the mains voltage is 
applied, it allows execution of a test program, on the 

basis of which the type of load can be recognized, and 
the control unit (3) in this case feeds a short control 

pulse to the power section (1) which is temporarily 
connected and supplies the load with a current pulse, and 

in that a load detector (9) is provided, which detects 
the turn-off voltage produced across the load (2) when 

the current pulse is turned off and, when a predetermined 
limit value is exceeded, signals the presence of an 

inductive load, and otherwise signals the presence of a 
capacitive and/or resistive load, and the control unit 

(3) receives this information for evaluation and, in the 
case of a capacitive and/or resistive load, stipulates 

phase lead. 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that a functional unit for current synchronization (6) 

and a further functional unit for voltage synchronization 
(7) are provided, and, in the case of an inductive load,  

 
the control unit (3) turns on the current synchronization 

system, which detects the zero crossing of the load 
current, and, in the case of a capacitive and/or resistive 

load, the control unit (3) turns on the voltage 
synchronization system (7), which detects the zero 

crossing of the AC voltage.
