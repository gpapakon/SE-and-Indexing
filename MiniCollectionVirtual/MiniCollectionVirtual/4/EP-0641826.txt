<ABSTRACT>
In order to cover an opto-electronic component, a casting resin system is proposed whose resin component A comprises a mixture of epoxyalkylsiloxanes and cycloaliphatic epoxide. The casting resin system can be cured by means of carboxylic anhydride as curing component B to give transparent and colour-stable moulded materials.

<CLAIMS>
Siloxane-containing casting resin system which
comprises a resin component A and at least one

carboxylic acid anhydride as the curing component B, the
A-component of which comprises

5 to 95 % by weight of epoxyalkylsiloxane and

95 to 5 % by weight of epoxide,

in which the epoxyalkylsiloxane has been obtained by
reaction of the epoxyalkoxysilane (1) with the silanol

(2)


wherein

R1
is an alkyl radical having 1 to 6 C atoms or an
aryl radical,
R2
is an epoxyalkyl or an epoxycycloalkyl radical, the
two radicals
R3
independently of one another are OR1 or R2 or
another alkyl or aryl radical,
R4
is alkyl or aryl, the radicals
R5
independently of one another are OH or R4 and
n
is an integer, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 12.
Casting resin system according to Claim 1, in
which the B-component comprises anhydrides of aromatic

and cycloaliphatic di- and tetracarboxylic acids.
Casting resin system according to Claim 1 or 2,
in which the B-component comprises, for flexibilization,

a carboxylic acid anhydride which is at least partly
esterified with alcohols.
Process for the preparation of a siloxane-containing
casting resin system comprising the following

steps:

a) reaction of the epoxyalkoxysilane 
1
 with the 
silanol 2, an epoxysiloxane being obtained,
b) mixing of the epoxysiloxane with a cycloaliphatic
or aromatic epoxide in a weight ratio of 1 : 20 to

20 : 1,
c) provision of a B-component comprising a carboxylic
acid anhydride.
Process according to Claim 4, in which step a)
is carried out in the presence of a neutral condensation

catalyst in the range of pH 5 to pH 8.
Process according to Claim 4 or 5, in which,
after step b), the casting resin system is subjected to

a heat treatment in vacuo.
Process according to one of Claims 4 to 6, in
which the reaction according to step a) is carried out

under stoichiometric conditions, so that one alkoxy
group in 
1
 is available per OH group in 
2
 capable of
condensation.
Process according to one of Claims 4 to 7, in
which 3-glycidylpropyltrimethoxysilane as the

alkoxysilane 
1
 and α,ω-propylphenylsilane diol as the
silanol are reacted with one another.
Use of the casting resin system according to
one of the preceding claims for covering optoelectronic

components.
