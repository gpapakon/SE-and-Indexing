<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to alkoxyphenylalkylamine
derivatives having an antipsychotic action.Antipsychotic drugs are used for treating not only
schizophrenia but also troublesome behaviors (for example,
aggression, mental excitation, fugue, delirium) accompanying
cerebrovascular disorders and senile dementia. However,
there is a serious problem that these classical antipsychotic
drugs cause extrapyramidal disorders as a side effect. In
order to solve this problem, approaches have been made in
recent years to develop antipsychotic drugs from a viewpoint
which is completely different from the action mechanism of
the classical drugs. As an example of these approaches, a
sigma receptor antagonist may be cited. It is considered
that sigma receptor is a receptor participating in mental
abnormality such as hallucination. A compound having a
specific affinity for this receptor would exhibit an
antipsychotic action without causing any extrapyramidal
disorders.Although Rimcazole is known as an example of such a
compound, its affinity and specificity for sigma receptor are
restricted. There have been known some compounds, for example,
N,N-dimethyl-2-(3-benzyloxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)ethylamine
described in J. C. S. Perkin I, (1975), page 1140, which are
similar to the compound of the present invention in
structure. However, these compounds are described merely as
a synthesis intermediate. Thus the action of the compound of
the present invention has never been reported hitherto.WO 90/11997 discloses alkoxyphenylalkylamine
derivatives which differ from the compounds of the present
invention in that the alkyl moiety [CH-(CH3)]p is branched
whereas according to the present invention the
alkoxyphenylalkylamine derivatives have a linear -(CH2)n- moiety.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
novel compound which has an antipsychotic action without
causing any extrapyramidal disorders.The present inventors have conducted extensive
studies on alkoxyphenylalkylamine derivatives. As a result,
they have found out a novel alkoxyphenylalkylamine derivative
which shows a specific and high affinity for sigma receptor,
thus completing the present invention.Now the present invention will be described in
greater detail.The present invention relates to an
alkoxyphenylalkylamine derivative represented by the
following formula (I): 

wherein
(1)
X1=4-MeO,X2=H,A-(CH2)m-O=3-(2-Ph-(CH2)2-O).n=2,R1=R2=n-Pr.(2)
