<ABSTRACT>
An organopolysiloxane for modifying curable 
organic and silicone compositions is disclosed, said 

organopolysiloxane having the general formula 

wherein each R¹ is a monovalent group independently 
selected from alkyl radicals having 1 to 5 carbon atoms 

and phenyl radical; R² is a monovalent group 
independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl radicals 

having 1 to 5 carbon atoms and phenyl radical; R³ is 
selected from alkoxysilylalkyl groups and alkyl groups 

having at least 6 carbon atoms; a is zero or a positive 
number; b is a positive number; c is a positive number; 

a/c has a value of zero to 
<
4; b/c has a value of 0.05 
to 4; and (a + b)/c has a value of 0.2 to 4, with the 

proviso that organopolysiloxane has in its molecule at 
least one said alkoxysilylalkyl group and at least one 

alkyl group having at least 6 carbons.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
organopolysiloxane that is composed of 
monofunctional siloxane units (M units) and 
tetrafunctional siloxane units (Q units) and that 
contains in each molecule at least 1 alkoxysilylalkyl 
group and at least 1 alkyl group having at least 6 
carbons. The invention also relates to a method for 
the preparation of this organopolysiloxane. Among the various organopolysiloxanes known in 
the art, MQ organopolysiloxane composed of the 
monofunctional siloxane unit (M unit) and the 
tetrafunctional siloxane unit (Q unit) is by virtue of 
its heat resistance used as a starting material for 
varnishes and pressure-sensitive adhesives JP-A 61-195129. 
More recently, hydroxyphenyl-containing MQ 
organopolysiloxane has been taught by JP-A 1-292036, and 
chloromethyl-containing MQ organopolysiloxane has been 
taught JP-A 2-153935. MQ organopolysiloxane has also 
been proposed that contains epoxy-functional organic and 
alkoxysilylalkyl groups (JP-A 5-105758 & EP-A-541988), and MQ 
organopolysiloxane has been proposed that contains epoxy-functional 
organic groups and diorganopolysiloxane 
residues (JP-A 3-331409). However, MQ organopolysiloxane 
having alkoxysilylalkyl and C≥6 alkyl groups on the 
monofunctional siloxane unit silicone (M unit) has 
heretofore been unknown. The present invention introduces an 
organopolysiloxane that is composed of the 
monofunctional siloxane unit (M unit) and tetrafunctional 
siloxane unit (Q unit) which contains in each molecule at 
least 1 alkoxysilylalkyl group and at least 1 alkyl group 
having at least 6 carbons. A method for the preparation 
of this organopolysiloxane is also provided.  
 Our organopolysiloxane has the general formula 
given below and contains in each molecule at least 1 
alkoxysilylalkyl group and at least 1 alkyl group having 
at least 6 carbons 
 
R1 is the phenyl group or a lower alkyl group having 5 or 
fewer carbons. These lower alkyl groups are exemplified 
by methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and pentyl. R2 is a 
group selected from hydrogen atom, phenyl group, and 
lower alkyl groups having 5 or fewer carbons, such as 
methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and pentyl. R3 represents 
the alkoxysilylalkyl or C≥6 alkyl groups (i.e., alkyl 
groups having at least 6 carbon atoms). The 
alkoxysilylalkyl groups of R3 are trimethoxysilylethyl, 
trimethoxysilylpropyl, trimethoxysilylbutyl, 
trimethoxysilylpentyl, triethoxysilylethyl, 
triethoxysilylpropyl, triethoxysilylbutyl, 
methyldimethoxysilylethyl, methyldimethoxysilylpropyl,
