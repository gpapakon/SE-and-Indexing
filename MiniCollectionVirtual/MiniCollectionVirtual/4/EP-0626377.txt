<ABSTRACT>
A selective method for producing a given 
stereoisomeric benzylidene derivatives of the formula III: 


wherein R¹ and R² each independently is lower alkyl, lower 
alkoxy or halogen; Y is SO₂, SO or CO; -A- is optionally 

substituted lower alkylene; -B- is -CH₂- or -O-; or -A- and 
-B- taken together may form optionally substituted 

phenylene or optionally substituted lower alkenylene; and R 
is hydrogen, optionally substituted lower alkyl, 

cycloalkyl, lower alkoxy, hydroxy, optionally substituted 
aryl, optionally substituted arylalkyl; optionally 

substituted arylalkyloxy, heterocyclic ring or N-protecting 
groups, which comprises reacting a compound of the formula 

I: 

wherein R¹ and R² are as defined above and X is lower alkoxy 
or halogen with a compound of the formula II: 


wherein Y, -A-, -B- and R are as defined above in the 
presence of a base.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel method for
producing benzylidene derivatives which have an
ability to suppress the production of PGE2, LTB4 and
IL-1, and can be useful as excellent non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory agentsIt is known from FR-A-2 634 764 to react a
benzaldehyde with an alpha halocarbonyl compound
followed by dehydration of the resulting product as
disclosed particularly in the synthesis on page 9 of
the specification. Further, EP-A-0 525 197 discloses
a process with a witting reagent or an organozinc
compound as set forth as production method II on pages
5 and 6 of this specification.Benzylidene derivatives represented by the
following general formula III

wherein R1 and R2 each independently is lower alkyl, lower
alkoxy or halogen; Y is SO2, SO or CO; -A- is optionally
substituted lower alkylene; -B- is -CH2- or -O-; or -A- and
-B- taken together may form optionally substituted
phenylene or optionally substituted lower alkenylene; and R
is hydrogen, optionally substituted lower alkyl,
cycloalkyl, lower alkoxy, hydroxy, optionally substituted
aryl, optionally substituted arylalkyl; optionally
substituted arylalkyloxy, heterocyclic ring or N-protecting
group are known to include many pharmaceutically useful 
compounds. For example, it has been suggested that a
compound of the formula III wherein -A- is -CH2CH2-, -B- is
-O-, Y is CO, R is -CH3, and R1 and R2 are both t-butyl can
be useful as an anti-inflammatory agent with low
ulcerogenic potential. Sung J. L. et al., Drugs of the
Future 17(1): 12-14 (1992); and S. Wong et al., Agents
Actions 37: 90-98 (1992). It has also been found that a
kind of benzylidene derivatives of the formula III have an
ability to suppress the production of PGE2, LTB4 and IL-1 in
vitro and prevent edema with little damages of gastric
mucosa invivo, and can be excellent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agents. There are disclosed in EP Appln. No.
93308369.3 (Publication No. 595546) corresponding to USP
Appln. No.08/142,146.These benzylidene derivatives of the formula III
can be prepared in a conventional manner, for example,
according to the following reaction scheme.

In the reaction scheme above, R is as defined above and R3
is hydroxy-protecting group in EP Appln. No. 93308369.3
(Publication No. 595546)Thus, hydroxy-protected 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde
4 is reacted with γ-sultam derivative 2
under a condition for aldol reaction to obtain an aldol
addition compound 5. The compound 5, when deprotected and
dehydrated in the presence of an acid, gives the
