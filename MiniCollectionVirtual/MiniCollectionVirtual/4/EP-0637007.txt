<ABSTRACT>
Panel type structure, comprising, on the one hand, a folding self-supporting chassis (1), arranged so as to have a deployed configuration and a collapsed configuration and, on the other hand, a flexible part (2) extending on the surface, fixed to the chassis (1) so as to be stretched in the deployed configuration of the latter, and folded over itself in the collapsed configuration of the chassis (1), characterised in that the chassis (1) comprises two lateral front uprights (3), on which two edges (2a, 2b), respectively of the rectangular flexible part (2) are fixed, and a rear central upright (4), as well as at least two elements (5) for linking between the three uprights (3, 4), respectively at the top and bottom of the chassis (1), each including two crosspieces (6). The central upright (4), the two corresponding crosspieces (6) and the corresponding lateral upright (3) are mounted and/or arranged so as to form a deformable parallelogram together in a plane (7) forming a dihedral with the plane defined by the two lateral uprights (3).
