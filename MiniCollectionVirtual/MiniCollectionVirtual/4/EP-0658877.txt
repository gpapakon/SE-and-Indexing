<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a speech coding systems, and 
more particularly, to a speech coding apparatus for encoding 
a speech signal in a high quality at a low bit rate, 
especially at 8-4 kb/s. Recently it has been of urgent necessity to implement 
a digitalized system of such devices as an automotive mobile 
phone or a code less phone employing a radio communication. 
Since an available frequency band is narrow in a radio 
communication, it is important to develop a system in which  
 
a speech signal is coded very efficiently in a high quality 
condition at a low bit rate by compressing the speech signal 
into smaller number of bits. CELP(Code Excited LPC Coding) as described in a paper 
titled "Code-excited linear prediction: High quality speech 
at low bit rates" by M. Schroeder and B. S. Atal(ICASSP 
Proc. 85, pp. 937-940, 1985; hereinafter referred to as the 
"reference No. 1") is known as a coding system in which a 
speech signal is coded at a low bit rate of 8-4 kb/s. In this method, an encoding process is carried out at 
a transmission side in the following procedure. First, for 
every frame (for example, 20 ms), spectrum parameters 
representing frequency characteristics of the speech signal 
are extracted(short-term prediction). Then each frame is subdivided into narrower subframes 
(for example, 5 ms). In every subframe, a pitch parameter 
representing a wide interval correlation(pitch correlation) 
is extracted from past speech source signals and the long-term 
prediction of a speech signal in the subframe is 
carried out with the pitch parameter. Next, a code vector and a gain which minimize the 
error power between a synthesized signal generated using the 
code vector extracted from a noise signal (code vector) 
which is composed of pre-prepared types of quantization 
codes, and a residual signal obtained by the long-term  
 
prediction, are decided. The index representing the type of 
the decided code vector, the decided gain, the spectrum 
parameter, and the pitch parameter are transmitted. More specifically, in search of a quantization code 
the following procedure is employed. First, a signal z[n] is 
derived by executing a weighting for compensation of an 
auditory sense to, and subtraction of a past influence 
signal from, an inputted speech signal x[n]. Next, a synthesized signal Hej[n] is calculated by 
driving with a code vector ej[n] of a quantization code j, a 
synthesis filter H composed of spectrum parameters, obtained 
by the short-term prediction, quantized, and inversely
