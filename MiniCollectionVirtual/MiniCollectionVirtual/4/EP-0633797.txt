 CATHETER WITH INTERIOR BALLOONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates generally to catheters adapted for use in surgical procedures and more specifically to catheters having inflatable balloons.Discussion of the Prior ArtIn many surgical procedures it is desirable to introduce an elongate flexible object into a body conduit and to enlarge the distal end of that object at an operative site. Catheters are well known to perform this function, and in one common variety a balloon is disposed at the distal end of the catheter to provide for the desired enlargement. When this balloon is inflated, it typically exceeds the radial diameter of the catheter.Several surgical procedures, such as e bolectomy and angioplasty procedures, take advantage of this balloon catheter construction. In an embolectomy procedure, the distal end of the catheter is introduced beyond a thrombus or embolus, the balloon is inflated, and the catheter with enlarged balloon is withdrawn. In this procedure, the enlarged balloon pushes the thrombus or embolus out of the vessel as the catheter is withdrawn. 

 In an angioplasty procedure, the balloon of the catheter is inflated in proximity to athroscorotic plague. In this common procedure, the pressure of the balloon forces the plague against the vessel walls thereby enlarging the flow path through the vessel. These and other techniques benefiting from balloon catheter technology are disclosed in the following patents which are incorporated herein by reference:Ï‹. S. Patent No. InventorIn all of these procedures, the initial diameter of the catheter is of particular interest. This elongate flexible structure is typically introduced through long, sometimes torturous, conduits in order to reach the operative site. In some cases, these conduits are quite narrow so that the diameter of the catheter is of critical importance. Such is the case with arteries in the hand of a patient. An embolectomy procedure performed in these environments might require a catheter having a diameter as small as 1 French.The problem with achieving catheter diameters of this size has been significantly compounded in the case of balloon catheters. With these devices, the balloon structure has typically been provided on the outside of the catheter thereby increasing the diameter of the device. An inflation hole extends through the catheter wall into an inflation lumen of the catheter. The balloon with a cylindrical configuration is disposed over this hole and 

wound on the catheter body

CLAIMS
1. A balloon catheter, comprising: a catheter body extending along a longitudinal axis between a proximal end of the catheter body and a distal end of the catheter body; an outer wall included in the catheter body and defining at least one lumen extending longitudinally of the catheter body; portions of the outer wall included in the catheter body and defining an opening from the lumen outwardly of the catheter body; an expandable material including a peripheral edge portion and a central portion and being mounted in the catheter body with the central portion extending distally of the peripheral edge portion; retention means spaced proximally of the opening for permanently securing the peripheral edge portion of the expandable material [membrane] to the catheter body; inlet means for admitting a pressurizing fluid into the lumen; and the expandable material being inflatable upon entry of said pressurizing fluid into the lumen, from a deflated state wherein the central portion is disposed entirely within the lumen, to an inflated state wherein the central portion extends through the opening [lumen]
 to form a seal with the wall [thewall] portions, and beyond the catheter wall to form a balloon exteriorly of the catheter body.
2. The balloon catheter recited in Claim 1 wherein the portions of the outer wall define the opening axially of the catheter body at the distal end of the catheter body. 


3. The balloon catheter recited in Claim 1 wherein the portions of the outer wall define the opening radially of the catheter body.
4. The balloon catheter recited in Claim 1 wherein the expandable material comprises an elongate tube having a proximal end and being sized and configured for disposition in the lumen of the catheter body, the peripheral edge portion of the expandable material being disposed at the proximal end of the tube.
