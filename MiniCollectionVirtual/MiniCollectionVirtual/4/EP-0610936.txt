<ABSTRACT>
A lithographic printing plate material utilized for silver 
salt diffusion transfer includes an undercoat layer containing 

a solid particle dispersion of a dyestuff, a silver halide 
emulsion layer, and a physical development nucleus layer on a 

support. It exhibits high sensitivity, high resolving power 
and good printability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver salt lithographic 
printing material intended for producing positive and negative 
transfer silver images. More particularly, it relates to a 
silver salt lithographic printing material utilized for laser 
exposure and silver salt diffusion transfer and exhibiting 
improved photographic properties, minimized scumming, improved 
ink receptivity and printing endurance. There are known in the prior art a number of lithographic 
printing materials utilizing silver salt diffusion transfer. 
Typical printing materials have integrated together a 
photographic element having photosensitivity and a printing 
image element in the form of a physical development nucleus 
layer as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication 
(JP-B) No. 42453/1971 and 30562/1973. They use conventional 
negative emulsions so that transferred silver images are 
positive. In accordance with the recent advance of the computer 
technology, attention is now paid to the direct process wherein 
printing plates are directly exposed to final images through an  
 
image setter using a laser or light-emitting diode light 
source. For further increasing resolving power upon laser 
scanning exposure, it is desired to enhance anti-halation 
ability. Systems for producing a transferred silver image as a 
negative image are also described in JP-B 13587/1986, 
06108/1982, and 26019/1981, and Japanese Patent Unexamined 
Publication (JP-A) No. 173247/1986. These systems, however, 
are unacceptable in practice because of low sensitivity, 
shortage of transferred silver, and unsatisfactory properties 
as printing plates including ink receptivity, plate wear (also 
known as printing endurance or run length), and scumming (also 
known as toning). In the case of scanning exposure by laser or the like, a 
lithographic printing material designed to produce a 
transferred silver image of the negative type has the reduced 
risk of scumming because the only requirement is to expose 
image portions including characters, dots and lines and thus 
the exposed area is small. Another advantage is ease of 
matching with output machines such as image setters among which 
the negative output type is predominant. However, in practice, 
there are available no acceptable lithographic printing 
materials of the negative type because none of then can satisfy 
the requirements of sensitivity and printing characteristics. One method for producing transfer silver images of the 
negative type uses direct reversal emulsions. The direct
