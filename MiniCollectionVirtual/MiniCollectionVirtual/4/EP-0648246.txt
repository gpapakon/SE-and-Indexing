<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the conversion of polyether polyol-based
scrap polyurethane polymer to polyols and the manufacture of fresh polyurethane polymer
therefrom.The extensive industrial use of polyurethane polymer and the production thereof
is accompanied by a considerable accumulation of waste or scrap polyurethane polymer which
may be disposed of by incineration or landfill. However such disposal, besides not giving full
consideration to the environment, is a permanent loss of costly materials. It is therefore of
interest to consider the recovery and eventual reuse of such materials.Procedures for recovering the polyurethane raw materials from scrap
polyurethane polymer are known in the art. U.S. Patent 2,937,151 discloses dissolving flexible
polyurethane foams in liquid polyalkylene glycol ethers, polyester or polyesteramides.
U.S. Patent 3,632,530 discloses decomposition of a polyurethane by heating in the presence of
an aliphatic diol such as ethylene glycol or dipropylene glycol. However, in practice, methods
for recovering scrap polyurethane based on degradation of the foams in the presence only of
alcohol groups are excessively time consuming, even in the presence of catalysts, such as taught
in U.S. Patent 3,300,417. An increased rate of dissolution of the scrap polyurethane by the use
of primary amines in place of alcohols is taught in U.S. Patent 3,117,940. U.S. Patent 3,708,440
discloses the dissolution of rigid isocyanurate foam in a mixture of diethylene glycol and
diethanolamine. U.S. Patent 3,404,103 discloses decomposing polyurethane in an aliphatic
amine, e.g. monoethanolamine, in the presence of an alkali metal oxide or alkali metal
hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, to obtain an amine derivative and a polyether;
separating the polyether from the amine derivative and reemploying the polyether for
production of urethane polymer.All of the procedures noted above yield a mixture of polyols, aromatic and
aliphatic ureas, and aromatic and aliphatic amines, and occasionally some soluble urethane
fragments. Such mixtures, as obtained according to the above noted procedures, frequently
undergo phase separation into a polyol component having a low density and viscosity, and an
amine component having a higher density and viscosity. Such two phase mixtures besides
being more difficult to handle must always be well mixed before they can be used in any
subsequent application or else there is little or no reproducibility and consistency of results.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the recovery of scrap polyether polyol-based polyurethane
polymer in the form of a polyol by treating at a temperature of from 70°C to 200°C the scrap

polyurethane with a liquid mixture which consists of an alkanolamine and a metal hydroxide.
and subsequently reacting the resulting intermediate product with an alkylene oxide to

provide said polyol characterized in that:

a) the alkanolamine is present in an amount of from 70 to 95 percent based
on total weight of the liquid mixture;
b) the weight ratio of scrap polyurethane to liquid mixture is from 12:1 to
50:1; and
c) the alkylene oxide comprises propylene oxide or ethylene oxide.
A process according to Claim 1 wherein the alkanolamine is
diethanolamine and the metal hydroxide is potassium or sodium hydroxide.
A process according to Claim 1 wherein the amount of alkylene oxide is
such to provide the resulting polyol with a hydroxyl number of from 30 to 213.
A process according to Claims 1 to 3 wherein The weight ratio of scrap
polyurethane polymer to liquid mixture is from 15:1 to 30:1.
A process according to Claims 1 to 3 wherein the scrap polyurethane
polymer is the reaction product of an aromatic polyisocyanate with a polyether polyol which

has a molecular weight of from 1000 to 10000.
