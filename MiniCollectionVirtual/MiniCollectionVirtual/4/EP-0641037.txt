The invention provides a strip line-type high-frequency 
element comprising a plurality of wide ground 

conductors, and first and second strip lines disposed in 
an area covered by said ground conductors, wherein said 

first and second strip lines are connected to form a 
coil of one or more turns, and wherein said coils are 

disposed such that they look aligned when viewed in a 
direction perpendicular to their winding direction. The 

strip lines may be formed by conductors disposed on two 
or more dielectric or magnetic substrates. The element 

may be used as a directional coupler in the transmitter 
of a portable telephone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-frequency
element comprising a plurality of strip lines, more
particularly to a chip-type directional coupler.Conventional high-frequency elements comprising a
plurality of strip lines are illustrated as a
directional coupler in Fig. 4. In this directional
coupler, a main line and a sub-line are disposed on the
same substrate as a planar type. Two strip lines 53, 54
are disposed in parallel spaced apart by a distance S on
a front surface of a dielectric substrate 51 formed with
a ground conductor 52 on a rear surface. Each of
parallel portions of the strip lines 53, 54 is as long
as one quarter of a wave length of an electromagnetic
wave propagating through the dielectric substrate 51.A high-frequency signal supplied from a port P1
passes through a strip line 53 (main line) and exits
from a port P2. At this time, by coupling of the strip
line 53 (main line) and the strip line 54 (sub-line),
part of electric power of the high-frequency signal
passing through the strip line 53 flows into the strip
line 54 and goes to the port P3. As a result, there is
no output at port P4. Next, when a high-frequency
osignal flows through the strip line 53 (main line) in
an opposite direction, namely from a port P2 to a port
P1, part of electric power of the high-frequency signal
goes to a port P4, not to a port P3. Thus, with this
structure, part of an electric signal passing through
the strip lines 53 (main line) in a forward direction
and that in an opposite direction can be led to the
output ports P3 and P4, respectively, of the strip line
54 (sub-line). This is the basic operation of the
directional coupler.The coupling of the main line 53 to the sub-line 54 
can be controlled by adjusting the distance S between
the parallel portions of the two strip lines.In Fig. 4 illustrating the conventional directional
coupler, the main line is a strip line 53 while the sub-line
is a strip line 54. However, because of the
structural symmetricity, the main line and the sub-line
may be interchangeable without affecting the basic
operation of the directional coupler.Fig. 5 shows another conventional directional
coupler in which a strip line 65 (main line) and a strip
line 66 (sub-line) are stacked. In this example, a
strip line 66 is formed on a front surface of a
dielectric substrate 61 coated with a ground conductor
64 on a rear surface. Disposed above the substrate 61
is a dielectric substrate 62 formed with a strip line 65
(main line) such that the strip line 65 (main line) is
separated
