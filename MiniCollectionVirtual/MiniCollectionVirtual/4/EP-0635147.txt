<ABSTRACT>
An oil supply device, usually a pad (32) or roller (30), for applying release oil to a fuser roll in a photocopying machine comprises an open-cell melamine foam reservoir (26) capable of operating at temperatures of 200  DEG C, having an oil-permeation control layer (14, 15) over the reservoir for controlling the supply of release oil. The oil permeation control layer may be a separate cover wick (20) or may be laminated by a layer (13) of adhesive to the reservoir (26). The device may be oil-fed or prefilled with oil. The oil permeation control layer is preferably a porous PTFE network formed by fusing granular-type PTFE particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to material for use as 
an oil reservoir for applying release oil to a fuser roll 
in an image reproduction machine. As used herein, the term "image reproduction" relates 
to machines which employ heated fuser rolls, for example 
plain paper copying machines and laser printers. In a plain paper copying machine, toner images 
applied to the surface of paper or other recording medium 
are fixed by application of heat and pressure. In certain 
plain paper copying machines, fixation is accomplished by 
passing the image-bearing recording medium between a hot 
thermal fuser roll and a pressure roll. When this type of 
thermal fixation device is used the toner material is 
directly contacted by a roll surface, and a portion of the 
toner usually becomes adhered to the roll surface. On 
subsequent rotation of the roll, the adhered toner 
material may be re-deposited on the recording medium 
resulting in undesirable offset images, stains, or 
smears; or in severe cases the recording medium may stick 
to the adhered toner material on the roll and become 
wrapped around the roll. To counter these problems, materials having good  
 
release properties such as silicone rubber or 
polytetrafluoroethylene are often used for the roll 
surfaces. Although improving the performance of the 
thermal fixation devices, use of silicone rubber or 
polytetrafluoroethylene roll surfaces alone does not 
eliminate the problem. Another approach is to include 
release agents with the toner materials, which prevent the 
toner materials from adhering to the roll surface. These 
oil-less toners improve the performance of the thermal 
fixation devices but again, particularly in the case of 
high-speed type copying machines, do not completely 
eliminate the problems associated with toner pick-up and 
transfer. Toner pick-up by the rolls can be controlled by 
coating the surface of at least one of the rolls with a 
liquid release agent, such as a silicone oil. It is 
important that the release liquid be applied uniformly and 
in precise quantities to the surface of the roll. Too 
little liquid, or non-uniform surface coverage, will not 
prevent the toner from being picked up and re-deposited on 
the roll. On the other hand, excessive quantities of the 
release liquid may cause silicone rubber roll surfaces to 
swell and wrinkle, thus producing copies of unacceptable 
quality. Devices to meter and coat a release liquid uniformly 
onto copy machine roll surfaces are described in Japanese 
laid-open patent
