<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for coating a paper web   having two rolls which are arranged parallel to each other and together form a roll nip for guiding the paper web through; having at least one application nozzle for applying a layer of coating colour to the outer surfaces of at least one of the rolls for the purpose of transferring the layer of coating colour in the roll nip from the outer surface onto one side of the paper web; having guide elements which are connected downstream of the roll nip and guide the dried paper web.   The invention is characterised by the following features:   the guide elements are air-support beams which produce an air-support cushion between the paper web and the surface, facing the paper web, of the air-support beam; at least one air-support beam is connected directly downstream of the roll nip; the air-support beams are arranged in such a way that the paper web is deflected at least once after the roll nip.
