<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a double interrupting device housed in the cut off chamber of a casing of a cut off apparatus such as contactor or contactor-circuit breaker, comprising at least one movable contact (20) interacting with a fixed contact, and associated with fins an arc deflector (3) taking the general shape of a U and having a V or Y-shaped cut out in which the fixed contact is housed. This fixed contact includes a fixed contact support (10) and a contact bead (11), and is such that the fixed contact support is a solid piece, flat and not folded.

<CLAIMS>
Double current breaker device housed in the 
interrupter chamber of the casing of a switch device, 

especially a contactor or a contactor/overload relay, 
said device including a moving contact bridge, each 

contact having a contact pad which cooperates with a 
contact pad on a fixed contact support, said contact 

bridge moving in translation along an axis passing 
through said fixed and mobile contact pads and, 

associated with deionizer splitter plates, a bent arc 
deflector which is generally U-shaped and includes a 

solid bottom plate and a top plate substantially parallel 
to said bottom plate, joined together by bridges, said 

top plate having a V-shape or Y-shape cut-out around said 
fixed contact pad and being located between said fixed 

contact support and said contact bridge when said 
contacts are closed, said fixed contact support being a 

flat solid part which is not bent and which rests on the 
upper surface of said bottom plate of said deflector, and 

said top plate of said deflector and said splitter plates 
being parallel to the plane of said contact bridge. 
Device according to claim 1 wherein said top 
plate and said bottom plate of said deflector are flat. 
Device according to claim 1 wherein said fixed 
contact support is attached to said bottom plate of said 

deflector. 
Device according to claim 1 wherein said 
deflector is made by cutting and bending a single sheet 

of ferromagnetic metal. 
Device according to claim 1 wherein said top 
plate of said deflector is not in contact with said 

contact support so that an insulative space is created 
along all of the length of said deflector. 
Device according to claim 1 wherein said V-shape 
or Y-shape closed cut-out in said deflector is a notch  

 
which converges to form a circular contour towards the 

edge of said top plate near said casing. 
Device according to claim 1 wherein said 
splitter plates mount between plates to which they are 

fixed. 
Device according to claim 1 wherein said 
splitter plates have free ends between said flanges.
