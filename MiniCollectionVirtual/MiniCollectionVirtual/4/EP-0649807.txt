<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for taking up a narrow sheet 
member (8) which is a tyre component in which disordered 

winding by detecting a difference between a delivery 
velocity and a takeup velocity of the narrow sheet 

member (8) using a dancer member (17), and by controlling a 
drive motor (13) of a bobbin (12) using the detected signal in 

such a way that the takeup velocity and the delivery 
velocity are equal to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
taking up a narrow sheet member which is utilised 
for the manufacture of a tyre component such as a 
thread or cord reinforcement-containing rubber sheet 
or a nylon strip. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Hei 5(1993)-8321) 
discloses a technique for rewinding a sheet 
member such as a cord-containing rubber sheet which 
has previously been prepared in a wide form, 
splitting the sheet into several narrow sheets or 
strips, delivering the narrow sheets in the 
longitudinal direction thereof, and winding the 
sheet members around a bobbin one by one. A narrow sheet member take-up method according to the preamble 
of claim 1 and a narrow sheet member take-up apparatus according 
to the preamble of claim 4 are known from US-A-4 293 101. The prior art disclosed in the foregoing patent 
publication is effective to a certain extent, but 
can give variations in winding tension on a bobbin, 
and hence disordered winding, when a difference 
between its delivery velocity and the takeup 
velocity of the narrow sheet members is caused by 
variations in takeup diameter or the like.  
 Hence, the object of the present invention is to 
provide a takeup method and apparatus which can 
prevent disordered winding and enables even takeup 
of narrow sheet members while the adhesion or 
sticking together to the sheet members, coiled 
around a bobbin, is prevented. According to a first aspect of this invention, there 
is provided a narrow sheet member takeup method 
according to claim 1. According to a second aspect of this invention, 
there is provided a narrow sheet member takeup 
apparatus according to claim 4.  
 As a result the wide sheet member, consisting of a 
ply master roll such as a cord-containing rubber 
sheet coiled in the form of a roll, can be rewound. 
This wide sheet member is then delivered to the 
bobbins of the takeup apparatus in the longitudinal 
direction of the sheet member by means of a delivery 
means. During the course of delivery of the wide sheet 
member, it is split into several narrow sheet 
members by a slitting means and a splitting means. 
The narrow sheet members thus split are spirally 
coiled around the bobbins, respectively.  
 When there arises a difference between the delivery 
velocity and the takeup velocity of the narrow sheet 
members, the dancer members carry out dancer 
operations, and a switching means detects the 
velocity difference. The narrow sheet members are 
taken up by controlling the drive motors in such a 
wa

A narrow sheet member take-up method comprising 
the steps of splitting a wide sheet member (6) into 

a number of narrow sheet members (8), delivering the 
split narrow sheet members (8) in the longitudinal 

direction thereof, spirally winding the narrow sheet 
members (8) around bobbins (12), respectively, 

detecting a difference between a 
delivery velocity and a take-up velocity of the 

narrow sheet members (8) by means of dancer members

velocities of the tension rollers (9) so that the 

tension rollers (9) having a longer delivery 
distance for the narrow sheet members (8) gradually 

move faster than those tension rollers (9) having a  
 

shorter delivery distance for the narrow sheet 
member (8).
