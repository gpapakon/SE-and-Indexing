<ABSTRACT>
A knee prosthesis includes a femoral component in 
which the condyles have a continuous contact surface for 

the tibial bearing surface and in which the sagittal 
radius is constant from posterior to a point more anterior 

than the distalmost point. The tibial bearing surface is 
shaped to have a curvature which corresponds closely with 

that of the femoral condylar surfaces. The tibial 
component includes a plastics meniscus component supported 

on a metal platform for sliding movement in the anterior-posterior 
direction and the mating surface between the 

meniscus and platform has a sagittal curvature which is 
larger than the sagittal radius of the femoral condyles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to prostheses for knee 
replacement. Most of the knee replacement designs in current use 
are of the Condylar Replacement type, where the arthritic 
joint surfaces are resected and are replaced with metal 
and plastic surfaces. There are two conflicting 
requirements in design; first, the desirability for 
freedom of motion requires relatively low conformity 
between the femoral and tibial surfaces, while the 
desirability for low contact stresses on the plastic 
surface requires high conformity. This conflict similarly 
applies to the patello-femoral bearing joint. US-A-4224696 discloses a tibial base plate for a knee 
prosthesis which comprises a metal platform which has an 
upwardly concave surface and a plastics meniscal component 
which has a convex undersurface. According to the invention there is provided a tibial 
component of a knee prosthesis which comprises an upwardly concave 
metal 
platform adapted to be secured to a resected tibia and a 
plastics bearing component mounted for sliding movement 
thereon, the mating surface between the plastics component 
and the metal platform being substantially cylindrical 
with the axis of the cylinder extending in a lateral-medial  
 
line. By providing for sliding movement in the anterior-posterior 
direction, the prosthesis has freedom of 
movement in the anterior-posterior direction, which allows 
a higher degree of flexion, while reducing shear stresses 
in the component-bone interfaces. The cylindrical bearing surface between the plastics 
component and the metal platform viewed in a sagittal 
plane constrains the movement in the anterior-posterior 
direction. Also, the upwardly curved interface between 
the plastics component and the metal platform introduces 
increasing constraint due to gravity forces as the 
plastics bearing component displaces further away from its 
central position. Various features and advantages of the present 
invention will become clear from the following description 
and accompanying drawings in which:- 
Figures 1(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) are perspective 
views of the normal knee at various degrees of flexion 
from 0 to 120°,  
 Figure 2(a) is a perspective view of a knee fitted 
with a prosthesis in accordance with the invention at zero 
flexion, Figure 2(b) is a perspective view of the knee (with 
the femur removed for clarity), fitted with same 
prosthesis at approximately 90° flexion, Figure 3(a) is a perspective view of a femoral 
component in accordance with a first embodiment of the

<CLAIMS>
A tibial component of a knee prosthesis which 
comprises an upwardly concave metal platform (71,81) 

adapted to be secured to a resected tibia and a plastics 
bearing component (72,82) mounted for sliding movement 

thereon, characterised in that the mating surface between 
the plastics component and the metal platform is 

substantially cylindrical with the axis of the cylinder 
extending in a lateral-medial line. 
A tibial component as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the plastics bearing component comprises two plastics 

bearing components (91,92) supported on said metal 
platform, the mating surface between each plastics 

component and the metal platform lying on a cylinder whose 
axis extends in a lateral-medial direction. 
A component as claimed in claim 2 wherein said 
plastics bearing components are located on opposite sides 

of a guide rail (94) extending in the anterior-posterior 
direction and serving to guide said plastics bearing 

components for sliding movement relative to the metal 
platform in an anterior-posterior direction.
