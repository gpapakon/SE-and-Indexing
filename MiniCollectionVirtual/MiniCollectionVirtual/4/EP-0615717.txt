<ABSTRACT>
A liquid dispensing system providing a housing holding a liquid 
filled pouch (48) inside, the housing pivotably supporting an actuating 

arm (24) which is thrust against the pouch (48) by a push button (18) 
extending outside the housing, the actuating arm (24) having an actuator 

(84) to compress an upper section of a tubular peristaltic pump section 
(60) of the pouch for squeezing out an incremental amount of liquid. The 

tubular peristaltic pumping section (60) provides V-shaped notches 
(72,76) arranged on lateral sides of the top section and the bottom 

section for ease of closure by flattening and other advantages. A check 
valve (106) having lever arms (116,118) to resiliently stretch flat a 

discharge nozzle section (62) at the lower end of the peristaltic 
pumping tube prevents dripping during non-use. A check valve actuator 

(90) is provided on the actuating arm (24) to engage with the check 
valve lever arms (116,118) to open the discharge nozzle (62) during 

actuation and a short time thereafter to create a suck-back to remove any 
drips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid dispensing 
system, particularly to a soap dispensing cabinet wherein 
incremental amounts of soap can be dispensed in response 
to actuation by a user. A number of liquid soap dispensers are known. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,349,133, U.S. Patent No. 4,546,904, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,667,854 and U.S. Patent No. 4,463,876 are 
examples of such dispensers. U.S. Patent No. 4,349,133, 
which represents the closest prior art, 
discloses a liquid 
dispenser and refill package. The dispenser has a 
housing, flexible plastic pouch, pumping mechanism and 
a check valve mechanism. The housing provides a front 
half and a rear half joined together by a hinge. A pouch 
located within the housing includes a reservoir and a 
tubular pumping section in fluid communication with the 
reservoir. A "duck bill" check valve for preventing liquid 
leakage from the pumping section is located at the free 
end of the pumping section of the pouch. In Figure 6 of 
U.S. Patent No. 4,349,133, the "duck bill" check valve 
is illustrated. The "duck bill" valve is a plastic 
cylindrical closure having a diametric slit thereacross 
which is normally closed but openable when the liquid is 
pressurized by the pump. The pumping mechanism is 
contained within the housing and comprises a first block 
and a second block which sandwich the pumping section and 
squeeze the pumping section when forced together. The 
second block is mounted on a lever hinged to the housing.  
 
The lever actuates the pumping mechanism when grasped and 
pulled forward. U.S. Patent No. 4,546,904 is similar to U.S. Patent 
No. 4,349,133. A check valve is provided in this device. 
The check valve can comprise one of two embodiments: a 
first embodiment is a ball and spring valve (see Figure 
5); and a second embodiment is a slit diaphragm valve 
(see Figure 4). U.S. Patent No. 4,667,854 discloses a liquid 
dispenser having a roller which travels along the length 
of the pumping section. A check valve is provided which 
comprises a nozzle which has a small opening. U.S. Patent No. 4,463,876 discloses a pouch liquid 
dispenser system having a reservoir section, a pumping 
section, and a discharge nozzle. U.S. Patent No. 4,932,562, which names one of the 
two inventors of the instant invention as an inventor, 
discloses a liquid dispensing system. The system 
includes a compressible housing holding a flexible pouch 
therein for storing liquid such as soap. A valve 
mechanism for checking the flow of the liquid from the 
pouch is provided
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for dispensing incremental liquid portions 
from a liquid reservoir, comprising liquid dispensing means having a 

supply section flow communicating into a tubular section (60), said tubular 
section (60) terminating in a discharge nozzle section (62) having 

an aperture (64) at a terminal end thereof, a framework having 
means for supporting said liquid dispensing means, and means for selectively 

compressing said tubular section to at least partially collapse 
said tubular section to dispense said incremental liquid portion, characterized 

by the fact that said liquid dispensing means is formed by a 
film pouch (48) containing a tube member (70) mounted within said 

film tubular section (60) of said film pouch (48), and having a sufficient 
thickness to have structural memory to spring back after being at 

least partially collapsed. 
The apparatus according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that said means for compressing comprises an actuating arm (24) 

pivotally mounted with respect to said framework, said actuating arm 
having an impact portion (88; 196) having a first arcuate convex surface
