<ABSTRACT>
A drug formulation for producing sustained therapeutic 
efficacy, which releases water-soluble drug intracorporeally over 

a prolonged period of time at a substantially constant rate 

wherein said drug formulation comprises 

(a) a nondisintegrating inner layer comprised of a 
biocompatible material that contains uniformly dispersed 

water-soluble drug; and 
 
(b) an outer layer comprised of a biocompatible material 
that surrounds the circumference of the said inner layer, is 

impermeable to water, and is capable of controlling the swelling 
of the inner layer; wherein the ratio of the axial length of the 

drug formulation to the cross-secitonal diameter of the inner 
layer is one or more and one or both ends of the inner layer are 

open so as to come into direct contact with the external 
environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
As a result of recent advances in biotechnology, drug
therapy using proteinaceous drugs has become important. Most
proteinaceous drugs exhibit very short half-lives in the blood,
e.g., a few minutes to a few hours, and as a result it becomes
necessary to administer them at frequent intervals in order to
achieve long-term maintenance of the drug concentration in the
blood within therapeutic ranges. One problem generally
associated with the drug formulations known up to now is that the
drug concentration in the blood immediately after administration
can reach levels which may produce negative effects, and frequent
administration thus tends to increase the frequency of occurrence
of side effects. In addition, the use of injectable drug
formulations of this type places a very heavy burden on the
patient because it requires frequent hospital treatment or
outpatient visits and causes pain at the time of administration.Given the foregoing circumstances, it is desirable to
develop a controlled release drug formulation that is capable of
maintaining the therapeutic efficacy of water-soluble drugs, such
as proteins, over prolonged periods after a single
administration.The use of polymeric materials as drug carriers is the most
common technology for sustained drug release systems, where the
main goal is the maintenance of sustained therapeutic efficacy in
the body. In systems in which the drug is dispersed in a 
hydrophobic polymer carrier, the release mechanism for lipophilic
drugs, which are capable of spontaneous diffusion through the
carrier, is completely different from that for a water-soluble
drug dispersed in the carrier since water-soluble drugs cannot
spontaneously diffuse through the carrier. Achieving the
controlled release of lipophilic drugs is relatively
straightforward since these drugs can diffuse through polymer
carriers (Contraception, volume 27, number 5, pages 483-495 (May,
1983), Chem. Pharm. Bull., volume 29, number 9, pages 2714-2717
(1981)).A channeling phenomenon participates in the release
mechanism for water-soluble drugs from hydrophobic polymer
carriers. Here, the drug present in the vicinity of the surface
of the formulation first dissolves in the ambient water (body
fluids and so forth). This step is followed by dissolution of
the drug present around the resulting cavities, and the
repetition of this process leads to the formation of continuous
channels. In this case, the drug present in the interior of the
formulation is released by diffusion through the resulting
channels.In one
