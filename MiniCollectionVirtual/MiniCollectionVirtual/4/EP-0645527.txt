<ABSTRACT>
A method of reducing ignition temperature during 
exothermic catalytic reactions in gaseous reactants in a 

process gas being passed through a monolithic structured 
catalyst unit provided with a plurality of small hydraulic 

diameter channels (2) and a plurality of large hydraulic diameter 
channels (4), which method comprises passing a first 

portion (8) of the process gas through the small diameter 
channels (2) and a second portion (10) of the process gas through 

the large diameter channels (4), so that the first gas portion (8) 
flows at a low flow velocity and a high reaction rate in 

the unit and excess of heat evolving during the catalytic 
reactions proceeding at the high rate in the small diameter 

channels is transferred to the second portion (10) of the process 
gas to reduce the ignition temperature of the catalytic 

reactions proceeding in the large diameter channels (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to exothermic catalytic 
reactions in gaseous reactants passing through a monolithic 
catalyst body. In particular, the invention is concerned with 
reduction of the ignition temperature during oxidation and 
combustion processes. Conventionally used combustion or oxidation catalysts 
like the catalysts in the form of pellets with a 
porous structure usually show inconvenient high pressure 
drop of a process gas. Therefore, many commercial catalytic 
combustors utilize monolithic supported catalysts rather 
than pellets. Monolithic structured catalysts having a 
plurality of channels provide a low pressure drop during 
oxidation or combustion reactions. While those reactions proceed exothermic on the 
catalyst, it is necessary to raise the temperature in the 
feed gas to a level above the ignition temperature in order 
to maintain the reactions proceeding in the channels of the 
catalyst structure. Thus, catalytic combustors are usually 
equipped with preheaters operating either on support fuel 
or electrical energy for the preheating of the feed gas. 
Compression of the feed gas also increases the gas temperature 
and partly or completely provides necessary preheating 
to the compressed gas. As a major drawback of preheating during catalytic 
processes in general, necessary supply of extraneous energy 
results in poorer process economy and higher investment 
costs for preheating equipment. Furthermore, preheating by 
burners causes formation of nitrogen oxides and reduces 
strongly the environmental advantage of catalytic combustion. 
This is, in particular, a problem in the catalytic 
combustion of gases with high ignition temperature such as 
methane and other hydrocarbons, which demand extensive 
preheating.  
 A catalyst body with reduced back pressure resistance 
and improved warming up performance is disclosed in 
JP 63 11 3112. The body is composed of 3 monolithic sections 
with increasing inner peripheral surface of each 
monolith section in the direction of gas flow.  
 Thus, a general object of this invention is 
directed to the improvement of exothermic catalytic processes 
being carried out in monolithic structured catalyst, 
by reducing the ignition temperature of the reactions 
proceeding on the catalyst and, thereby, substantially 
reducing energy consumption during those processes. Ignition temperature as used herein defines the 
lowest temperature at which the exothermic reactions begin 
and continue in a process gas passing through the monolithic 
catalyst
