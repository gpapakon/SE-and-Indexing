<ABSTRACT>
A magnetoresistive (MR) read transducer (30) having an exchange layer (32) adjacent a 
soft active layer (SAL) (34). The exchange layer (32) generates a transverse bias field 

which saturates the SAL with little or no sense current.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thin film magnetic transducer 
heads and in particular to magnetic heads including a 
magnetoresistive layer and a soft active layer for biasing. The use of a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor to sense or read 
magnetically recorded data is well known in the art. Also well 
known is the use of both longitudinal and transverse bias to 
eliminate Barkhausen noise and to maintain the sensor in its most 
linear operating range. U.S. Patent No. 4,024,489 describes an 
MR sensor in which a hard magnetic bias layer is employed. In 
this sensor, both the MR layer and the hard bias layer extend 
across the entire sensor to produce a transverse bias. An objective in the design of disk drives is to use MR 
sensors having reduced sizes to facilitate the recording of data 
on reduced track width media, i.e., increased track density 
media. As an example, U.S. Patent No. 5,018,037; issued to 
Krounbi et al., describes an MR read transducer having a central 
active region and passive end regions. The end regions of this 
MR sensor have hard magnetic bias layers which generate a 
longitudinal bias. The central active region contains a soft 
active layer (SAL) for transverse biasing. The device described 
in the patent allows the design of smaller transducers to read 
the data recorded on reduced track widths at increased recording 
densities. Another problem facing the magnetic recording industry is 
that sufficient sense current to saturate the soft active layer 
is difficult to achieve in read transducers having reduced sizes. 
In the Krounbi '037 sensor, the moment ratio between the MR layer 
and the soft active layer (SAL) assists in saturating the SAL 
when a sense current is applied. However, the current required  
 
to saturate the SAL is on the order of 10 milliamps (mA). In 
certain applications, this sense current magnitude is especially 
undesirable. Examples of such applications include small disk 
drives and narrow gap sensors, in which high current densities 
are required to properly saturate the soft active layer. An object of this invention is to provide an MR read 
transducer with a soft active layer requiring a low sense current 
for biasing. Another object of this invention is to reduce the power 
required to operate an MR read transducer having a soft active 
layer for biasing. In accordance with this invention, an MR read transducer 
has a central active region and means for generating longitudinal 
bias. The central active region includes a soft active layer for 
longitudinal
