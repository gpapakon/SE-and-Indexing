<ABSTRACT>
An end wall for a can body has a central panel (7) surrounded by a conventional expansion ring (8) which is connected to an inner wall (16) of a channel portion by an upwardly extending deformable annulus (17, 18) so that during thermal processing of a closed can having this end wall, the deformable annulus changes shape to permanently increase the container volume. The deformable annulus protects the side wall and ends of the can from excessive pressure so thinner container materials may be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to metal containers and more particularly but not exclusively to the bottom wall of a container
drawn from a circular blank to comprise a bottom wall and a side wall upstanding from the periphery of the bottom wall.A widely used container for petfoods, typically 73mm diameter by 56mm tall comprises a substantially flat centre
panel surrounded by a flexible annulus which is joined to a channel portion, or stand bead, having an inner wall joining
the flexible annulus and an outer wall joining the side wall of the container The containers are usually drawn from a
laquered steel such as electrochrome coated steel or tinplate in temper DR8 of thickness 0.17 mm (about 0.007"). The
side wall of this can is vulnerable to damage at point of sale. When the containers are filled, the closing machine applies
a top pressure to a can end while a double seam is rollformed to join the can end to the side wall, so the side wall has
to be strong enough to support this top load. When the closed containers are thermally processed the contents of the
can expand so pressure develops in the container and the side wall is protected from undue distortion because the
flexible annulus permits the bottom wall to bulge outwardly to increase the container volume. As the container cools,
the pressure in the can abates. If the product is hot filled, a partial vacuum may develop in the container when cooled
to room temperature so putting the side wall at risk of collapse unless the flexible annulus returns towards original shape.Can ends which provide the desired expansion and contraction in container volume by simple flexure are described
in US Patents 3105765 (Creegan) and 3409167 (Blanchard), and in British Patents Publications 2107273 and 2119743
(of American Can Company) but in all these 
patents the change of volume available in a filled and
closed can is limited to that available from flexure, not
permanent change of shape.These volume change requirements are made more
stringent if tall cans having a wall ironed side wall are
used because the side wall may be between 0.075mm
(0.004") and 0.0125mm (0.005").A first objective of this invention is to provide a
container having an end wall which will provide an
increased volume during thermal treatment to reduce the
pressures generated within the can during thermal
processing. A second objective is to provide some
flexibility to compensate for a residual partial vacuum
in a filled and closed can. The end wall may be integral
with the side wall of a drawn can

<CLAIMS>
A container end wall (4), comprising a peripheral
channel portion (5), or cover hook (315) and an inner

wall (16, 316) which supports a centre panel (7, 37),
wherein a deformable annulus (6) extends both radially

and axially inwards away from the inner wall (16, 316),
characterised in that there is a stiff downwardly

dependent annulus (19, 39) connecting the centre panel
(7, 317) to the deformable annulus (6) such that when

subjected to pressure inside the container after closure,
the centre panel (7, 317) is temporarily deflected

axially outwards and the deformable annulus (6) is
permanently deflected from an initial stable position to

a second stable position to increase the volume of the
container.
A container end wall according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the stiff downwardly dependent

annulus (19, 39) is substantially undeformed as the
deformable annulus (6) is deflected from its first stable

position to its second stable position.
A container end wall according to Claim 1 or Claim
2, characterised in that the second stable position is

such that the centre panel (7, 37) does not protrude
beyond the level of the channel portion (5) or the cover

hook (315).
A container end wall according to any preceding
claim, characterised in that the central panel (7, 37)

comprises a central panel portion surrounded by at least 
one flexible expansion panel (8, 38) which is connected

to the deformable annulus by a dependent annulus in the
form of a stiff substantially cylindrical wall portion

(19, 39).
A container end wall according to any preceding
claim, characterised in that the deformable annulus

comprises, in its initial stable position, a
substantially flat annular portion (17, 317) which

extends radially inwards from the inner wall and
surrounds an annular bead (18, 318) of arcuate cross-section

which extends axially away from the flat annular
portion before turning to join the dependent annulus (19,

319).
A container end wall according to any preceding
claim, characterised in that an outer wall (315) of the

channel portion is a peripheral cover hook (316) for
attachment to the flange of the side wall of a container

body.
A container end wall according to any of claims 1 to
5, characterised in that the outer wall (15) of the

channel portion (5) connects with the side wall (2) of a
can body drawn from a blank.
A container end wall according to any preceding
claim, characterised in that the deformable annulus (30)

is frustoconical. 
A container end wall according to Claim 8,
characterised in that the frustoconical deformable

annulus (30) has a plurality of stiffening beads (38)
which extend across its width.
A container end wall according to Claim 7,
characterised in that the radial width of the deformable

annulus (6, 30) is greater than the width of the channel
portion.
A container end wall according to any preceding
claim, characterised in that the inner wall (16) and

deformable annulus (30) are connected by a radius R
1
 of
the order of 1.0mm.
A container end wall according to claim 5,
characterised in that the radius of curvature of the

annular bead (18, 318) is of the order of 0.75mm.
