<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for generating a liquid spray from two 
jets of fluid which issue from a pair of opposing nozzles (8,9) 

and interact, wherein the fluid is supplied to the 
nozzles (8,9) under fully turbulent conditions such that random 

variations in the momentum of the fluid as it leaves the 
nozzles (8,9) occur which results in random variations in the 

orientation of the resultant spray of liquid drops.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to spray generators of
the type in which two opposed jets of liquid impinge on
each other and are disrupted to form a curtain of drops.In our earlier patent application, EP 0 331 343
which represents the prior art as referred to in the preamble of claim 1, (US
Patent 4,943,007) there is disclosed a spray generator in
which two opposed jets of liquid impinge upon each other
and are disrupted to form a curtain of liquid drops.
Substantially uniform cyclic disturbances are imposed
upon the fluid flows at the nozzles, and these cause the
spray of droplets to oscillate regularly through an arc.
A similar arrangement is disclosed in GB specification
949,954.In both the above spray generators there is included
a phased valving device which modulates the flow to one
or other of the fluid flow lines leading to the nozzles.Spray generators such as those described in either
of the above specifications are satisfactory in
operation, but the presence of the phased valving device
can give an opportunity for failure, and is a factor in
the overall cost of the devices. The spray generator of
GB 949,954 provides a limited volume region of spray and
is not suitable for use in combination with a vortex gas
flow chamber.Specification GB 1,253,221 discloses a liquid
spray generator for use with an aerosol spray canister in
which a nozzle head has two inlet passages which converge
at an acute angle and open into a cylindrical cavity from
which there is a single outlet orifice. Jets of liquid
issuing from the passages interact within the chamber to
form a sheet of fluid which is then formed into a spray 
of a form which is defined by the shape of the cavity and
the outlet orifice.The whole purpose of the device is to produce a
liquid spray which has a defined, stable, form. The
present invention on the other hand, has for its purposes
the production of a spray which varies randomly both in
terms of its spatial distribution and droplet sizes. The
randomness in the spray is induced by causing the fluid
supplied to two opposed nozzles to be supplied in such a
way that the momenta of the jets of fluid issuing from
the nozzles vary randomly.Specifications DE-C-74301 and FR 1253929-A disclose
an apparatus in which a spray of water is formed by the
collision of two jets of water which issue from two
opposed nozzles. However, in DE-C-74301, the spray is in
the form of a downwardly directed conical sheet of
droplets. Both the form and direction of the spray of
droplets are fixed and determined solely by

<CLAIMS>
A method for generating a liquid spray of the type
in which two opposed jets of liquid impinge upon each

other and are disrupted to form a curtain of drops and
for flowing a gaseous medium through the curtain of drops

to interact therewith, which method comprises flowing a
gaseous medium through a chamber(2) with inlet(3) and

outlet(4) ports for the flow of gaseous medium
therethrough, and supplying liquid via liquid flow

lines(6,7;63,64;71,76;73,77) terminating in opposed
nozzles(8,9;65,66;71',76';73',77') within the chamber(2),

from which opposed nozzles(8,9;65,66;71',76';73',77') the
liquid flow emerges in the form of the said opposed jets

of liquid which impinge upon one another and generate a
spray of liquid within the chamber(2), 
characterised by

the combination of features that the chamber(2) is a
vortex chamber having at least one tangential inlet

port(3) for the gaseous medium and an axial outlet
port(4) therefor, and that the liquid is supplied to flow

to the nozzles(8,9;65,66;71',76';73',77') under
conditions for which the Reynolds number is greater than

12,000.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the vortex
chamber (2) is cylindrical and the opposed nozzles

(8,9;65,66;71',76';73',77') are positioned so as to
discharge the liquid axially in the cylindrical vortex

chamber (2).
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, further

characterised in that
 there is included a sump (11) for
collection of the liquid after it has interacted with the

said medium and there is provided means for removing
collected liquid (12) from the sump (11). 
A method according to claim 3, further 
characterised
in that
 the means for removing the collected liquid (12)
from the sump (11) is a pump (14) which also circulates

the liquid to the nozzles (8, 9).
A method according to any preceding claim, further

characterised in that
 a plurality of vortex chambers (10)
each having a pair of opposed nozzles (8, 9) mounted

axially therein are arranged sequentially so that the
outlet port (4) of one vortex chamber (2) communicates

with the inlet port (3) or ports of a succeeding vortex
chamber (2).
A method according to claim 5, further 
characterised
in that
 there is provided means for enabling a gas
treatment liquid to be passed sequentially through the

plurality of vortex chambers (2) countercurrent to the
flow through the plurality of vortex chambers (2) of a

gaseous medium to be treated in the apparatus.
A method according to any preceding claim, further

characterised by
 means for vaporising a liquid medium and
supplying the vaporised medium to the vortex chamber (2)

thereby to perform a distillation function.
A method according to any preceding claim, further

characterised in that
 the nozzles (65,66)) are annular in
section and co-axial.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 7, further

characterised in that
 a pair of nozzles (71', 76', 73',
77') are positioned side by side and are supplied with

liquid from a common supply (72).
