<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (1) for producing gaseous fuel for driving electricity generating means comprises an oven (2), a ram (11) for feeding gas-producing waste material to the oven (2), gas burners (5) for heating the waste material while in the oven (2), and a collection vessel (25) for collecting gaseous fuel liberated by heating the waste material. The oven (2) and waste material feeder duct (7) connected thereto are of airtight construction, so that combustion of the waste material is not allowed to take place. The airtight oven (2) has a central gasifier section (15) having an inlet end (15a) and an outlet end (15b). The feeder duct (7) is connected to the inlet end (15a) and an outlet duct (16) is connected to the outlet end (15b). The outlet duct (16) extends into the collection vessel (25), which has an upper end housing a gas filter (26) and a lower end connected to an ash receptacle (27). Gaseous fuel passing through the filter (26) enters a discharge line (29) connected to a gas chiller unit (30). The unit (30) has a hot water/steam outlet (35), a cold water inlet (36), and a gas/vapour outlet (37) which discharges to a gas/water separator (38) wherein condensate (39) is collected, and gaseous fuel allowed to leave by way of a discharge line (40). The gas discharge line (40) incorporates a branch line (47) whereby useable gas is led away for combustion for driving the electricity generating means and a further branch line (48) whereby gas is fed to the oven burners (5) by way of a regulator valve (49) and a gas burner control unit (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gasifying waste material and is particularly
concerned with the generation of electricity thereby.A major and widely-used method of waste disposal is landfill. However,
there are significant problems associated with landfill including the lack of
available landfill sites, the pollution of groundwater and the uncontrolled
generation of gas.Incineration is an alternative method of waste disposal alleviating the
problems of landfill by burning off most of the organic constituents of the
waste to leave a solid ash residue for disposal of considerably reduced
volume. However, the exhaust fumes resulting from incineration are a
source of pollution, and are difficult to treat in order to meet current
environmental standards.DE-A-3048350 discloses plant for generating electricity, using gaseous fuel
produced by heating waste material, without allowing combustion to take
place.FR-A-2366354 discloses an oven, means for feeding waste material to the
oven, and for heating the waste material while in the oven, without
allowing combustion to take place, and means for collecting gaseous fuel
liberated by such heating.US-A-3775071 discloses plant for gasifying coal particles, wherein the coal
is transferred between hoppers before heating takes place in a reactor
operating at super-atmospheric pressure. According to the invention, a method of gasifying waste material in an
apparatus consisting of at least one first hopper means and a second hopper
means for accommodating said waste material, said hopper means being
connected by a duct with a non-return gas sealing means at entry to the
second hopper, purging means being provided so as to introduce inert gas
into the second hopper and a gasifier connected to the second hopper
means, said method consisting of the following steps:
transferring waste from the first hopper to the second hopper;preventing air passing from the first to the second hopper during the
transfer by use of the inert gas purging means;closing the non-return valve means;purging the waste in the second hopper;transferring the waste to the gasifier;heating the waste in the gasifier without allowing combustion to
take place.The invention also comprises apparatus for carrying out the method.The invention is also concerned with the conversion of the waste material
into disposable ash.The various aspects of the invention will now be described by way of
example only, with reference to the accompanying semi-diagrammatic
drawings, wherein:-
