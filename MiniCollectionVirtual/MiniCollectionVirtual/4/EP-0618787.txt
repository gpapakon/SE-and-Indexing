<ABSTRACT>
Artificial ligament for the replacement of a natural articular ligament, including two extreme intra-bone portions (1) and an intermediate intra-articular portion. Said artificial ligament is characterized in that at least said intra-articular portion (2) is formed from two strands (6) of independent longitudinal fibres obtained by rolling over one another two knitted fabric widths, or two half widths of a single knitted fabric partially split in its median part along a length at least equal to that of said intra-articular part (2). The two extreme intra-bone portions (1) are twisted at least a quarter of a turn in relation to one another when the ligament is positioned in the articulation. The invention also concerns a process for the manufacture of said ligament.
