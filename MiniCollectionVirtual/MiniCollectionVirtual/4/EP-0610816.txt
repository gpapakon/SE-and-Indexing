<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rigid, single- or multilayer, unoriented or monoaxially or biaxially oriented film in which at least one layer contains a cycloolefin copolymer, characterised in that the cycloolefin copolymer has an intrinsic modulus of elasticity Ei which has the following dependence on the glass transition temperature Tg:  Ei = (0.0025 GPa/@C]
 x Tg[@C]) + B[GPa]
 where B = 2.93 to 3.19.i
