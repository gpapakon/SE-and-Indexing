<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims to provide a female terminal 
metal fixture for a connector, in which a contacting 

pressure on an elastic contact piece can be precisely 
and easily measured. In the fixture, a box like fitting 

portion 2 is provided in its interior with an elastic 
contact piece 5. The piece 5 has a contact area 6 adapted 

to elastically contact with a male terminal metal fixture. 
The contact area 6 electrically contacts with the male 

fixture when it is inserted into the fitting portion 2. 
The portion 2 is provided with an inspection aperture 8 

in its upper wall 7 above the contact area 6. Measurement 
of a contacting force on the elastic contact piece 6 and 

observation of a surface condition of the piece can be 
effected through the inspection aperture 8.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a female terminal metal fixture for a 
connector, which has a box like fitting portion with an open end and is 
adapted to receive a male terminal metal fixture for a mating connector in 
the fitting portion. For convenience of explanation, a conventional female terminal 
metal fixture for a connector will be described below by referring to 
Figure 3. Figure 3 is a perspective view of the conventional female 
terminal metal fixture for a connector. A female terminal metal fixture 30 in a connecting construction of 
a connector is produced by punching a metal sheet into a given shape and 
bending it to a given form. The fixture 30 is provided on its front end 
with a box like fitting portion 31 having an end opening 34 and on its rear 
end with a barrel portion 32. An end of an electrical wire not shown is 
fixed to the barrel portion 32 by means of crimping. The fitting portion 31 is provided in its interior with an elastic 
contact piece 33 which is formed by bending inwardly an end of a bottom 
wall of the portion 31 through the end opening, as shown in Figure 3. 
The elastic contact piece 33 is bent slightly upwardly at its middle portion 
to form a contact area 36. Elasticity is imparted to the elastic contact 
piece 33 by forming a turned-back portion 35 and the bent contact 
area 36. A female terminal metal fixture of this kind is known from 
EP-A-5 098 59.  
 In order to couple a male mating terminal metal fixture not shown 
to the female terminal metal fixture 30, an elongate projecting tab of the 
male terminal metal fixture is inserted into the box like fitting portion 31 
of the fixture 30. At this time, the tab is clamped between the contact 
area 36 on the elastic contact piece 33 and an upper wall of the fitting 
portion by an elastic force exerted in the piece 33, so that the male and 
female  
 
terminal metal fixtures are positively brought into 
electrical contact with each other. If the elastic force (contact force) of the elastic 
contact piece 33 is small, the piece 33 cannot clamp the 
male terminal metal fixture sufficiently. This results 
in a contact failure between the male and female terminals. 
Accordingly, heretofore, inspection of products regarding 
the contact force of the elastic contact piece has been 
carried out. In order to directly measure such contact force, 
an experiment has been effected by opening a wall of the 
box like fitting portion 31 to expose the elastic contact 
piece 33 and then pushing a measuring tool onto the piece 
33 to

<CLAIMS>
A female terminal metal fixture (1) for a connector including a box 
like fitting portion (2) which has an open end and is adapted to receive a 

male terminal metal fixture for a mating connector, an elastic contact 
piece (5) which is formed by turning back an extending wall of said fitting 

portion into the interior of said fitting portion so that a contact area (6) on 
said elastic contact piece (5) elastically contacts with said male terminal 

metal fixture when it is inserted into said fitting portion, and a barrel 
portion (3) adapted to hold an end of an electrical wire by means of 

crimping,
 
   said female terminal metal fixture (1) being characterized in that 

said fitting portion (2) is provided with an inspection aperture (8) in its 
upper wall (7) above said contact area of said elastic contact piece, 

whereby, said contact area is readily accessible through the inspection 
aperture. 
A female terminal metal fixture according to Claim 1, wherein said 
inspection aperture (8) is formed into a square shape.
