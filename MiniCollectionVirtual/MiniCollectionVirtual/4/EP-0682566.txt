<ABSTRACT>
An umbilicus (24) conveys fluid between a stationary body and a rotating body in a small, compact operating environment. The umbilicus comprises an elongated body (200) including a proximal end, a distal end, and a middle region between the proximal and distal ends. A first support block (204) is attached to the proximal end. A second support block (206) is attached to the distal end. The first support block (204) includes a strain relief sleeve (212). The umbilicus is otherwise free of any other strain relief sleeve. A thrust bearing member (214) in the middle region spaced apart from the strain relief sleeve (212) and the distal end. The umbilicus is otherwise free of any other thrust bearing member. The thrust bearing member (214) has an inner annular body (218), an outer annular body (216) about the inner annular body (218), and an array of ball bearings (220) between the inner and outer annular bodies. The ball bearings (220) support the inner annular body (218) for rotation relative to the outer annular body (216).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to blood processing systems
and apparatus and is as defined by the appended claims.Today people routinely separate whole blood by
centrifugation into its various therapeutic components,
such as red blood cells, platelets, and plasma.Conventional blood processing methods use durable
centrifuge equipment in association with single use,
sterile processing systems, typically made of plastic.
The operator loads the disposable systems upon the
centrifuge before processing and removes them
afterwards.Conventional centrifuges often do not permit easy
access to the areas where the disposable systems reside
during use. As a result, loading and unloading
operations can be time consuming and tedious.Disposable systems are often preformed into
desired shapes to simplify the loading and unloading
process. However, this approach is often counterproductive,
as it increases the cost of the
disposables.US-A-4710161 describes a continuous type
centrifugal separator in which a completely closed
system is realised, which is suitable for separating
heavy and light components of blood.US-A-4194684 describes a centrifugal processing
apparatus with a rotatable processing chamber and an
umbilical cable segment comprising a polyester
elastomer tubing which is fixed at one end
substantially along the axis of the processing chamber,
with the other end being attached on the axis in a
rotationally locked engagement with the processing
chamber.US-A-4109832 describes a centrifugal processing
apparatus and an umbilical cable segment carrying a 
flexible sheath, the sheath having a shank portion
which extends from the axis along a portion of the
cable segment, and having thickness which decreases
along the cable segment in the direction away from the
axis.The invention makes possible improved liquid
processing systems that provide easy access to external
and internal components for loading and unloading
disposable processing components. The invention 
achieves this objective without complicating
or increasing the cost of the disposable components.
The invention allows relatively inexpensive and
straightforward disposable components to be used.One aspect of the invention provides an
umbilicus for conveying fluid between a stationary
body and a rotating body. The umbilicus comprises
an elongated body including a proximal end, a distal
end, and a middle region between the proximal and
distal ends.A first support block is attached to the
proximal end. A second support block is attached to
the distal end. The first
