<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITORS AND RELATEDCOMPOUNDS COMBINED WITH TAXOLFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention describes the use of compounds that are used in combination with taxol to control cancerous growths and tumors. Protein kinase inhibitors and related compounds are combined with taxol and taxol related compounds and the combination of compounds exhibits powerful potentiating effects when used to treat cancer. Many of the compounds are protein kinase inhibitors, other compounds achieve similar effects but are not necessarily protein kinase inhibitors. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTaxol was first isolated from the baric of the western yew, Taxus brevifolia, and identified as an antitumor agent in 1971 by Wani, et al. Recently, phase π clinical trials with taxol have shown it to be one of the most exciting chemotherapeutics available. Taxol has proven effective in drug-refractory ovarian cancer (McGuire, et al., 1989), and has shown a 56% objective response rate in metastatic breast cancer (Holmes, et al., 1991). In addition, there is reason for hope that taxol may be effective in many other types of cancers.The development of taxol, however, has faced many obstacles. Taxol's poor solubility required that it be administered in the vehicle Cremophor EL (polyethylated castor oil), which led to a high incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. It is not clear whether these reactions are caused by the vehicle or the drug, but it was found that using longer drug infusions (Weiss, et al., 1990) and anti-allergic regimens (Rowinsky, et al., 1990) reduced the incidence of such reactions. In addition, there are inherent problems in producing sufficient quantities of taxol. Extraction from the bark of the extremely slow growing western yew using present methods cannot meet the demand for taxol. Cultivation of the western yew may take years to establish, synthesis of the complex taxol molecule will be difficult andNor very expensive. Alternative sources of taxol or a taxol substitute or a taxol additive would therefore be highly desirable.Taxol has been shown previously to be toxic to tumor and leukemia cells inoculated in mice, including L-1210, P388 and P-1534 leukemia cells and Walker WM-256 carcinosarcoma, sarcoma 180 and Lewis lung tumor cells (Wani et al., 1971). It has also been shown to be toxic to cultured human HeLa cells (Schiff et al., 1979 ) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells (Cabral et al., 1981). This evidence of toxicity to rodent and human tumor cells in vitro and to tumor bearing mice in vivo
