<ABSTRACT>
A lever device having a point-of-support regulator (12) movably connected to a first motor (14) and a point-of-force 
regulator (13) movably connected to a second motor (15), wherein the motor (15) is driven in a state in which 

the motor (14) is stopped, and wherein mold clamping by means of injection molds (20A, 20B) is effected when the 
motor (15) is driven after the injection mold (20A) has been caused to approach the other mold (20B) that confronts 

the former.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a two-stage drive
type lever unit in which a force is applied first to a
force point and then to a fulcrum, and a machine apparatus
using the same as defined in the preamble of claim 1 and 3 respectively. Such devices are known from US-A-3 830 614.When, e.g., an injection mold is to be locked by
using a pressing device, after a mold weighing, e.g.,
100 kg is moved for 5 cm to a locking position, the mold
is moved for only 1 mm to perform necessary mold
locking. In mold locking, a pressure of 5,000 kgf (1kgf = 9,81 N) is
required to move a 100-kg mold for a travel of 1 mm.
Although a kinetic energy of 100 kgf is sufficient for
moving the 100-kg mold for 1 mm for initial positioning,
5,000 kgf is required to move this mold for the same
distance of 1 mm for mold locking. Thus, if only one
power source is provided, a kinetic energy of 5,000 kgf
is required to move the mold for 5 cm as well. In this
case, movement of 5 cm must be performed quickly, while
mold locking of 1 mm must be performed slowly. Hence, a
unit for changing the moving speed between movement and
mold locking is also necessary. In a conventional
pressing device, a lever unit is used to transmit
a kinetic force from a power source to a press head, 
a force from the power source is applied to the force
point of this lever unit, and the press head is
connected to the action point. However, since an
unnecessarily large power source must be used, the
energy is wasted, and the apparatus becomes large in
size.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention
to provide a small-size lever unit that can realize
energy conservation, and a machine apparatus using the
same.According to the present invention, this object can
be achieved by
the solutions of claim 1 and 3 respectively.Regarding the lever unit, the present inventor previously
invented a lever unit in which the fulcrum is
moved by the pivotal movement of a lever member and
filed this invention as, e.g., PCT International
Application No. PCT/JP90/00737 on June 6, 1990.FIG. 1 is a diagram showing the schematic arrangement

invention.FIGS. 2 to 4 are diagrams showing the schematic
