to act on a mixture of enantiomers of an epoxide 

such as 3-chlorostyrene oxide and the product optically 
active epoxide is recovered. The microorganism able to 

produce an optically active (S)-epoxide from the mixture 

of enantiomers of the epoxide include, for example, 
a microorganism strain belonging to the genus 


Candida
, the genus 
Rhodosporidium
, the genu
s Rhodococcus
 
and the genus 
Nosardioides

capable of producing an optically active 

(R)-epoxide from said mixture include a microorganism 
strain belonging to the genus 
Trichosporon
, the genus 

Geotrichum
, the genus 
Corynebacterium
, the genus 
Micrococcus
 
and the genus

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing an optically active epoxide with the use of a
microorganism. Such optically active epoxides are
important intermediates for the synthesis of various
medicinal compounds, optically active biologically
active substances and derivatives thereof.For the production of an optically active epoxide,
there are known chemical asymmetric epoxidation (J.
Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans., 2, 353 (1990), etc.) and a
technique with the aid of a microorganism (Journal of
Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan, 45, (2), 162
(1987), etc.), from the corresponding olefin. These
techniques, however, are not fully satisfactory in economical
factors, handling efficiency, yield or other
factors. Under the circumstances, the establishment of
an economical and expedient process for production of
an optically active epoxide has been demanded.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention
to provide a process for producing an optically
active epoxide efficiently with an simple and easy 
manner.It is another object of the invention to provide a
commercially useful process for producing an optically
active epoxide having a higher optical purity.A still another object of the present invention is
to provide a process for increasing the optical purity
of an optically active (S)- or (R)-epoxide efficiently
with simple and easy manner.The present inventors were interested in a process
for the economical and expedient (simple and easy)
production of an optically active epoxide having a
higher optical purity and, after extensive researches,
found that an optically active (S)- or (R)-epoxide
having a higher optical purity can efficiently be
obtained by permitting a microorganism or a preparation
thereof to act on a mixture of enantiomers of an epoxide.
The present invention has been accomplished on
the basis of the above findings.Thus, the present invention provides a process for
producing an optically active epoxide which comprises:
permitting a microorganism capable of producing an
optically active epoxide from a mixture of enantiomers
of an epoxide shown by the general formula (I)

   wherein R represents an optionally substituted 
alkyl group, an optionally substituted alkenyl group,
an optionally substituted cycloalkyl group, an optionally
substituted aryl group, an optionally substituted
aralkyl group
or a preparation thereof to act on said mixture
of enantiomers of the epoxide; and
recovering the product optically active epoxide.The present invention also provides a process for
