<ABSTRACT>
Current television transmission standards in Europe and other parts of the world 
operate with a 50Hz display refresh rate. The process of refreshing a CRT display 

causes a change of light intensity with time, called flicker. One method of removing 
the visibility of this flicker is to refresh the display at a higher frequency. The 

data in the additional fields may be generated from the original input signal when 
the images are static. When the images move, the subjective effect in each case is 

one of a double image. This is due to the data in the new fields being displayed in 

the wrong temporal position, and when the eye tracks the motion across the 
screen, a double image of one form or another results.

 
This appearance of a double image around moving objects may be reduced or removed 

by generating motion compensated 100Hz fields with the object in the correct 
position. When, however, the results of this technique are applied to motion 

compensated upconversion, objects or parts of the picture which fall outside the 
range of measurable velocities appear on the upconverted display with a very 

strong double image, resulting from the display of information in the wrong temporal 
position generated by uncompensated or 'fallback processing'.

 
According to the invention, the subjective strength of the double image is reduced 

by low pass filtering in a horizontal direction the components in the new fields of 
the upconverted signal which cause this double image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and to an apparatus
for motion compensated interpolation of intermediate fields or
frames.Current television transmission standards in Europe and other
parts of the world operate with a 50Hz display refresh rate. One
complete image, or frame, is transmitted every 1/25th of a
second. Each frame is composed of two half-images, or fields,
each one of which is transmitted every 1/50th of a second. Each
field consists of either the odd or even lines of a frame.
The process of refreshing a CRT display causes a change of light
intensity with time, called flicker. At 50Hz, the human eye is
still sensitive to this flicker, and on bright scenes and/or
large displays this flicker is noticeable. One method of removing
the visibility of this flicker is to refresh the display at
a higher frequency. This increase in field rate may be by any
arbitrary amount as long as a frequency is chosen which is
sufficiently great that the sensitivity of the eye is very low.
The frequency used as an example in this description is 100Hz, a
doubling in frequency which results in a relatively simple
hardware implementation, although in principle, any frequency
may be used and 75Hz has also been contemplated.
With the example frequency of 100Hz, there are two scanning patterns
which may be used, these are known as AABB and ABAB, where
the letters A and B refer to the positions of the odd and even
fields F. The arrangements of the two types of scanning is shown
in Figures 1A and 1C. Lines L which belong to the original input
signal are marked by a 'o' and new lines which must be created
are marked by a 'x'.
The data in the new fields may be generated from the original
input signal as illustrated by the arrows in Fig. 1. This presents
an acceptable picture quality when the images are static. 
When the images move, the subjective effect in each case is
one of a double image. This is due to the data in the new
fields being displayed in the wrong temporal position, and
when the eye tracks the motion across the screen, a double
image of one form or another results. This effect is shown
in Figures 1B and 1D, the latter of which shows 'mouse
teeth' artefacts.
This appearance of a double image around moving objects may
be reduced or removed by generating the new 100Hz fields
with the object in the correct position. This is done by
measuring the velocity with which the object is moving and
then interpolating the new field using information from the
correct position (i.e.from the object) in the source
fiel
