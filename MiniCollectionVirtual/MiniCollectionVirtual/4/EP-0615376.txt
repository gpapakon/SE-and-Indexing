<ABSTRACT>
In an image reading apparatus, an image pickup element is 
inputted a second driving pulse during a waiting period for 

waiting a next reading opertion, the pulse frequency of the 
secong driving pulse is lower than that of a first driving 

pulse which is inputted to the image pickup element during a 
reading period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image reading 
apparatus, and more particularly relates to improvements in 
control technique for controlling heat generation of a 
document image reading apparatus. A conventional digital type copier is well known as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public 
Inspection No. 157070/1987, in which images are formed in the 
following manner:
 
The surface of a document is optically scanned, and the 
obtained optical image is received by a solid state image 
pickup element such as a CCD so that the optical image is 
converted into an electric signal. Further, this electric 
signal is digitalized so that a digital signal can be 
provided. In accordance with the digital signal, which 
supplies information of the document image, a laser beam is 
modulated, and then an electrostatic latent image is formed on 
the surface of a photoreceptor by the modulated laser beam.  However, in the case of a solid state image pickup 
element used for reading images in the digital type copier, a 
dark current which deteriorates image quality is generally 
increased in proportion to the environmental temperature as 
shown in Fig. 7. For this reason, it is necessary to 
stabilize the temperature inside the apparatus. In order to stabilize the temperature inside the 
apparatus, in general, a fan is operated at all times so that 
the inside of the apparatus is forcibly ventilated to radiate 
the heat generated in the apparatus. When the above method is 
employed, it is unavoidable to prevent minute dust from 
entering the apparatus even when a filter is installed at an 
air inlet of the apparatus. After the dust has entered the 
apparatus, it adheres to the units of an optical system such 
as a piece of cover glass of the solid state image pickup 
element and mirrors for guiding the optical image to the solid 
state image pickup element. As a result, the image quality is 
deteriorated. When the fan is stopped in the above apparatus in which 
forcible ventilation is performed for radiating the generated 
heat, it is possible to prevent dust from entering the 
apparatus. However, unless the generation of heat is 
suppressed in the apparatus, the temperature inside the 
apparatus is raised as illustrated in Fig. 8, which results in 
the deterioration of image quality.  In order to suppress the generation of heat inside the 
apparatus, a technique is disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Publication Open to Public Inspection No. 50670/1989, in which 
the generation of drive pulses of the

<CLAIMS>
An image reading apparatus having a reading period for 
reading an image and a waiting period for waiting for a next 

reading operation, comprising: 
   an image pickup element to read an image in 

synchronization with a driving pulse; 
   a driving pulse generator for generating at least a first 

driving pulse having a first pulse frequency and a second 
driving pulse having a second pulse frequency lower than the 

first pulse frequency and for outputting one of the first and 
second driving pulses to the image pickup element; and 

   a controller to control the driving pulse generator in 
such a manner that the first driving pulse is outputted to the 

image pickup element during the reading period and the second 
driving pulse is outputted to the image pickup element during 

the waiting period. 
The image reading apparatus of claim 1, wherein the 
driving pulse generator includes a first clock generator to 

generate a first clock pulse corresponding to the fist pulse 
frequency, a second clock generator to generate a second clock 

pulse corresponding to the second pulse frequency, and a 
switch to select one of the first and second clock generators. 
The image reading apparatus of claim 2, wherein the 
controller outputs a control signal to the switch. 
The image reading apparatus of claim 1, wherein the 
driving pulse generator includes a frequency divider to divide 

a driving pulse so as to generate the first and second driving 
pulses.
