<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulically actuated bar-like clamping tool has an elongated base body (1), a reciprocating elongated clamping body (2) and a tubular inflatable body (18) arranged between both said bodies for moving the clamping body. The inflatable body is secured in a fluid-tight manner at one end and is connected to a fluid connection at its other end. The base body (1) and the clamping body (2) consist each of a U-shaped section with meshing legs (9; 10). A reciprocating, elongated thrust piece (15) supported on the ends of the legs of the clamping body (2) and a fixed, elongated abutment (13) are arranged between the legs (9) of the base body (1). The tubular inflatable body (18) extends on the one hand between the base body (1) and the pressure member (15) and after it is deflected it extend on the other hand between the abutment (13) and the clamping body (2). The U-shaped base body (1) has a shutting off arrangement (3) at least at its end provided with the fluid connection (3a).

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulically actuated, bar-like clamping tool, comprising 
an elongate base body (1), an elongate clamping body (2) which 

can be moved in a reciprocating fashion to said base body, and 
arranged between these two bodies, a tubular expansion body for 

moving the clamping body, said expansion body (18) being 
fastened at one end in a fluid-tight manner and at its other end 

being connected to a fluid connection, characterised in that the 
base body (1) and the clamping body (2) each consist of a U-profiled 

section having legs (9, 10) meshing with each other, that 
in the base body (1) between its legs (9) there is provided an 

elongate, reciprocating thrust piece (15) that is adjacent to the 
ends of the legs of the clamping body (2), and a stationary, 

elongate abutment (13), that the tubular expansion body (18) 
extends on the one hand between the base body (1) and the thrust 

piece (15) and, after it is deflected, between the abutment (13) 
and the clamping body (2) on the other hand, and that the U-shaped 

base body (1), at least at its end comprising the fluid 
connection (3a), comprises a shut-off device (3). 
A clamping tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the abutment (13) is formed as a tr
ansverse wall extending over 
the length of the clamping body (2) and parallel to the base body 

(1), and that between the two long side edges of the transverse  
 

wall and the two legs (9) of the base body (1) lying opposite these 
edges there is each formed a slot (14) for guiding the leg (12) of 

the clamping body (2). 
A clamping tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the thrust piece (15) comprises at least one guiding pin (16) 

which slides in a guiding hole (17) of the transverse wall (13). 
A clamping tool according to claims 1, 2 or 3, characterised 
in that both end side shut-off devices (3, 4) of the base body (1) 

each consist of an insert piece (5, 6) fixed to the base body and 
a shut-off cover (7, 8) attached to each insert piece. 
A clamping tool according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the legs (12) of the U-shaped clamping body (2) 

meshing into the U-shaped base body (1) along its meshing section 
(11) are formed in a set-back manner and each comprise an 

abutment shoulder (12) which comes to rest against the free end 
of the leg (9) of the base body (1). 
A clamping tool according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the shut-off device (4) in the region of the 

deflection location of the expansion body (18), comprises a contact 
surface (21) for the deflection location of the expansion body.
