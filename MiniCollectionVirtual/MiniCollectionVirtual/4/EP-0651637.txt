<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to a method for controlling wound scar production by administering a calcium antagonist, alone or in a combination with or followed by a steroid, to the wound site. The method can be used to minimize wound scars, such as hypertrophic wound healing disorders, keloids and burn scar contractures in humans or other mammals, particularly those individually prone to excessive scarring. Calcium antagonist treatment can also be used to control diseases associated with excessive scarring, such as cirrhosis of the liver, constructive pericarditis, Dupuytren's disease of the hand, plantar fibrosis of the foot, and various other fibromatoses.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONTROL OF WOUND SCAR PRODUCTION WITH CALCIUM ANTAGONISTS ALONE OR IN A COMBINATION WITH A STEROIDBackground of the InventionThe ability to heal by forming scars is essential for mammalian systems to survive wounding after injury. Normally, wound healing is a continuous process extending over a one-to-two-year period. The process can be conceptually divided into three fundamentally distinct stages. The first stage is an intensely degradative phase called the inflammatory stage. It occurs immediately after injury and provides a means to remove the damaged tissues and foreign matter from the wound. Two-to-three days later, as fibroblasts from the surrounding tissue move into the wound, the repairing process enters its second stage, the proliferation and matrix synthesis stage. The fibroblasts in the wound proliferate and actively produce macromolecules, such as collagen and proteoglycans, which are secreted into the extracellular matrix. The newly-synthesized collagen fibrils are cross- linked by lysyl oxidase and provide structural integrity to the wound. During this stage, fibroblasts also contract the intact collagen in order to reduce the surface area of the wound. This second stage lasts about three weeks. In the final, remodeling stage, the previous randomly-organized collagen fibril is aligned in the direction of mechanical tension and becomes more organized so that the mechanical strength of the wound area can be 

increased. The repair process is accomplished when the chemical and physical barrier functions of the skin are restored.Normal wound healing follows a well-regulated course. However, imbalances may cause abnormal scars to form. For example, if the biosynthetic phase continues longer than necessary or degradation of collagen decreases, hypertrophic scars may form. These scars cause problems ranging from aesthetic deformity to severe limitation of motion. Hypertrophic scars more frequently occur among children and adolescents, suggesting that growth factors may influence the development of this type of scar. Hypertrophic scars are especially common in patients who have burns or wounds that heal by secondary intention. Another type of excess scar is the keloid. In this disorder, the cells appear to lack sensitivity to normal feedback signals. They are larger than hypertrophic scars and grow in an unregulated way, tending to invade normal tissue surrounding the wound. They rarely disappear spontaneously and often recur after surgical excision. The management of these scars remains a major
