<ABSTRACT>
Bath-tub, in particular a whirlpool-type bath, 
comprising control and actuation elements, as well as 

water delivery elements, such as a means for actuating 
the plug provided to stop the water drain hole, a control 

means for mixing hot water with cold water so as to 
achieve a single flow of water at a desired temperature, 

an actuation means to divert said water flow towards the 
extractable nozzle of the hand-shower, a control means 

for starting and stopping the operation of the water 
circulating pump and the air blowing pump, a plug means 

for filling the disinfectant liquid into a respective 
reservoir and a switch means to operate a valve provided 

to let said disinfectant liquid into the water 
circulation circuit, as well as an extractable hand-shower 

and at least an outlet to deliver a cascade-type 
flow of water into the tub, wherein on the two upper 

edges of the opposing longitudinal sides of said tub 
there are installed in a central, mutually opposing 

position two respective large handles provided with an 
appropriately profiled portion, said control, actuation 

and water delivery elements being at least in part housed 
in said two large handles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement in a bath-tub
in which the control and command means are more
conveniently gathered in appropriate elements disposed
along the upper edges of the bath-tub itself.Bath-tubs, in particular whirlpool-type baths, are
known to be provided with a number of functional control
and actuation means, as well as water delivery means,
such as for instance a means for actuating the plug
stopping the water drain hole, a control means for mixing
hot water with cold water so as to achieve a single flow
of water at a desired temperature, an actuation means to
divert said water flow towards the extractable nozzle of
the hand-shower, a control means for starting and 
stopping the operation of the water circulating pump and
the air blowing pump, a plug means for filling the
disinfectant liquid into a respective reservoir and a
switch means to operate an electromechanical valve
provided to let said disinfectant liquid into the water
circulation circuit, as well as a hand-shower and at
least an outlet to deliver a cascade-type flow of water
into the tub.All such control and actuation means are typically
arranged either on the side wall adjacent to the tub or
along the upper edges of the sides of the tub, in
particular along the lengthwise extending sides of the
latter.Now, this gives practically rise to a double order of
drawbacks: the installation of said functional control
and/or actuation means directly on the surface of the tub
or the wall adjacent to the tub makes it necessary for
the manufacturer to provide a large number of drillings
in order to let said elements through the material of
which the tub is made, and this calls for a number of
very sensitive, high-accuracy and, therefore, also
expensive manufacturing operations to be additionally
performed, even in view of restoring water-tightness
around the spots where these elements protrude after
their installation.This is particularly true when said elements are
arranged on the wall adjacent to the bath-tub, this
making it in fact necessary to inevitably perform also
some masonry work and far more expensive installation
operations. Furthermore, normal or ordinary maintenance
of said elements, as well as their possible repair or
replacement, turn out to be quite complicated operations
to perform and would typically require the work of more
specialized professionals, such as masons, tilers and 
plumbers.The second drawback derives from the fact that such
control and actuation means, for them to be actuated
conveniently, shall be

<CLAIMS>
A whirlpool bath-tub (1), comprising:

two opposing longitudinal sides,
means (15) for mixing hot water with cold water so
as to achieve a single flow of water of a desired

temperature,
an air blowing pump and relevant circuits,
means (11) for respectively starting and
stopping the operation of

said air blowing pump;
two handles (3,4) placed on two upper edges (5,6)
of respective said opposing longitudinal sides of

said tub, bearing:
said means (11) for starting

and stopping the operation of
said air blowing pump,

characterised in that the bath-tub further comprises
a hand-shower (17) provided with extractable nozzle,
means (16) to direct said water flow towards said extractable
nozzle,
a water circulating pump and relevant circuits;
means (10) for starting and stopping the operation of 

said water circulating pump;
the handles further bearing
said means (15), for mixing hot and
cold water, said means (16) to direct said water flow towards

said nozzle, and said means (10) for starting and stopping the
operation of said water circulating pump;
a lean-on cushion (21) provided on one short side
of said tub, and being able to be inflated and

deflated through the admission and discharge of
compressed air or water into and from it, and

provided with respective control means (22,23)
whereby said respective control means

(22,23) relevant to said lean-on cushion (21)
operation, are arranged on one (3) of said two

handles.
Bath tub according to claim 1 , 
characterized in that

the compressed air or water used to inflate said
lean-on cushion are taken from said air blowing

circuits or alternatively from said water circulating
circuits.
Bath tub according to any of the preceding claims
