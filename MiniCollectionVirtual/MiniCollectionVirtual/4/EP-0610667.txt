<ABSTRACT>
A carrier for one or more reaction zones incorporated in the form of channels in this carrier, each of which zones is equipped with a colour indicator, is to be improved in such a way that a simply carried out, individually alterable coating of the reaction zones with the required indicators, which may be different, can be realised with uniform coating density. This is achieved by means of a carrier which is configured as a sandwich-type film composite which includes a reagent carrier film (12) which comprises a special plastic material, namely a perfluoroethylene-propylene (FEP) which has been surface-treated by means of a corona discharge (FEPc). A particularly favourable embodiment for the reaction zones on the reagent carrier film (12) comprises the reactants being applied to the reagent carrier film (12) in the form of a dot matrix (13) applied by means of a drop (droplet) generator (20).
