<ABSTRACT>
A raster scanning system is disclosed which utilizes micro-optics (52) for enabling the 
spot size (60) to be selected independent of the spot separation to generate a desired 

relationship between spot size and spot separation without sacrificing a significant amount of 
power of the light beams. The micro-optics used in this invention comprises a plurality of 

micro-lenses (54). Each micro-lens receives a light beam (30) from a respective lasing channel 
(28) of a laser light source (12) and refocuses the light on the image plane (56) of the micro-optics 

effectively creating a re-imaged light source, which compared to the laser light source, 
has the same spot separation (32) but larger spot size (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multi-channel laser light source used in a raster output 
scanner and, more particularly, to a multi-beam raster output scanner. Referring to Figure 1, a sagittal view of a conventional multi-beam raster output 
scanner 10 is shown which utilizes a multi-channel laser diode 12, a collimating lens 14, a spot 
size control aperture 16, a focusing lens 18, a scanning polygon (shown only with a line 20 as 
one of its facets), post polygon optics 22, which for simplicity is shown by only one lens, and a 
photoreceptor plane 24. For the purpose of simplicity, the reflected light beams from the facet 
20 are unfolded. Hereinafter, for the purpose of this application, the optical elements shown 
in the dashed box 26 are referred to as "common scanning optics 26". The light source 12 comprises a plurality of lasing channels 28 for generating a 
plurality of light beams 30. Each lasing channel has a channel separation 32 (center to center) 
from its adjacent lasing channels. Also, each lasing channel generates a light beam which has a 
spot at the light source 12 with a spot size 34. The separation between the spots is equal to the 
cnannel separation 32. In order to collimate each light beam 30, generated by the laser light source 12, the 
collimating lens 14 is placed one focal length f₁ away from the laser light source 12. The 
collimating lens 14 receives the light beams 30 from different lasing channels 28 of the laser 
light source 12. The collimated light beams emerging from the collimating lens 14 start 
converging towards each other and they all cross each other at the focal point 36. The spot 
size control aperture 16 is placed at the focal plane of the collimating lens 14 for clipping the 
light beams 30. After passing through the spot size control aperture 16, the collimated beams 
30, which have crossed each other at the focal point 36, start diverging from each other. The 
focusing lens 18 which is placed at a distance equal to its focal length f₂ away from the spot 
size control aperture 16, receives the collimated beams 30 which are diverging from each 
other. The focusing lens 18 focuses each beam individually on the polygon facet 20 whereby 
they are reflected onto the post polygon optics 22. The reflected light beams 30 pass through 
the standard post polygon optics 22 and then each light beam 30 individually focuses to a spot 
with a spot size 38 on the photoreceptor plane 24. At the photoreceptor plane 24, there is a 
distance 40 between the centers of adjacent
