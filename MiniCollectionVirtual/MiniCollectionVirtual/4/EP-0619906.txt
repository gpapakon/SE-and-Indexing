<ABSTRACT>
A passive surface wave sensor for obtaining measurement values in which the measurement value is transmitted by radio from the remote point of measurement to an interrogation device (1) which transmits energy by radio to the sensor component (5, 15) as an interrogation pulse. The surface wave sensor of the invention is suitable for contactless measurement value collection. In this sensor a surface wave arrangement is the sensor component and there is a surface wave reference component for phase discrimination and/or propagation time measurement. As a further embodiment there is a sensor operated by chirped transmission signals with chirped reflectors in which there is a reference function in the arrangement replacing the reference component. An embodiment of the sensor with a chirp function has the property of an immanent temperature-compensated sensor (Fig. 12, 13) for measuring physical or similar quantities elsewhere.
