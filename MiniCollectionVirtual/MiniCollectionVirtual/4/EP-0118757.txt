 POLYMERIC FERRO-ELECTRIC MATERIAL
Field of the Invention
 The present invention relates to a polymeric ferro-electric material. Particularly, it relates to a polymeric ferro-electric material comprising a vinylidene fluoride- trifluoroethylnene copolymer and having improved ferro-electric properties, particularly specific permittivity, piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity after poling.


Background of the Invention
 A ferro-electric material has a Curie's point and shows a hysterisis loop in a plotting curve of polarization against intensity of electric field. Accordingly, such the material has strong remanent polarization. When the material is ferro-electric, it has piezoelectric and pyroelctric properties.


 Piezoelectric or pyroelectric properties are properties that crystals of a material are electrically polarized corresponding to stress or thermal atress applied to the material. With the piezoelectric property, mechanical energy can be transformed to electric energy, and vice versa. The larger piezoelectric constant means better transformation efficiency, and therefore a material having the larger piezoelectric constant is more preferred as the piezoelectric material.


 Typical piezoelectric materials are ceramics and some polymers. Among the polymers, generally fluorinecontaining polymers have better piezoelectric property.  


 In addition to the good piezoelectric property, the fluorine-containing polymers have several preferable properties such that they are formed in a thin film having a large surface area and they can be mass-produced. Recently, the fluorine-containing polymers are, therefore, used in the acaustic field as a component of a head phone or a loudspeaker for high pitched sound.


 Among the fluorine-containing polymers, polyvinylidene fluoride (hereinafter referred to as   "PVdF")    has a comparatively larger piezoelectric constant and has been studied vigorously both in fundamental research and in application research. As is well known, PVdF has three crystal forms, namely alpha, beta and gamma forms. Among them, only the beta form PVdF has such a large piezoelectric constant as is practically used. However, a PVdF film manufactured by means of a film extruder, which is most convenient for mass-production of a polymeric film at a low cost, has the alpha crystal form and only a very poor piezoelectric property. In order to convert the alpha form
PVdF to the beta form one, it is necessary to stretch the former by several times. Further, the film should be heat-set to prevent
