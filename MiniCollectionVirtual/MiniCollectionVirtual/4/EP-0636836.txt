<ABSTRACT>
A burner for burning pulverulent fuel with combustion air divided into concentric partial flows has a primary-air tube (6) which carries primary air or primary gas and fuel and is surrounded by a secondary-air tube (12) carrying secondary air. The primary-air tube (6) is surrounded by a flow-directing device (26) at the discharge end inside the secondary-air tube (12) while forming an annular gap (25). Secondary air flows through the flow-directing device (26), which is open on both sides and projects beyond the primary-air tube (6) in the axial direction by an amount which corresponds to a value of up to 25% of the outside diameter of the primary-air tube (6). The width of the annular gap (25) is at least equal to 1.5% of the outside diameter of the primary-air tube (6).

Burner for combustion of powdered fuel with combustion air distributed in
concentric partial flows, wherein the burner comprises a primary air pipe (6) which

conducts primary air or primary gas and fuel and which is surrounded by a secondary air
pipe (12) conducting secondary air, wherein the primary air pipe (6) is surrounded at the

outlet end within the secondary air pipe (12) by a flow guidance device (26) which forms
an annular gap (25), is open at both ends, is flowed through by a secondary air and

projects in axial direction beyond the primary air pipe (6) by an amount, characterised
thereby that the amount corresponds to up to 25% of the outer diameter of the primary air

pipe (6), that the width of the annular gap (25) is equal to at least 1.5% of the outer
diameter of the primary air pipe (6) and that a throttle ring (30), which is axially

displaceable as far as into the inlet cross-section of the flow guidance device (26), is
arranged on the primary air pipe (6).
Burner according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the flow guidance device
(26) is supported on the primary air pipe (6) by way of support segments (29) which in the

flow direction of the secondary air are arranged at an angle of at most 80째.
Burner according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised thereby that the flow
guidance device (26) is provided with an outflow segment (28) which forms an outflow

angle of at most 25째 with the burner longitudinal axis (1).
Burner according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby that the flow
guidance device (26) is provided with an inflow segment (27) which forms an inflow angle

of at most 45째 with the burner longitudinal axis (1).
Burner according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby that a swirl flap
crosspiece is arranged in the secondary air pipe (12) upstream of the flow guidance device

(26).
Burner according to claim 5, characterised thereby that the swirl flap crosspiece is
adjustable. 
Burner according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised thereby that a core air pipe
(3) receiving an ignition oil lance (2) is arranged within the primary air pipe (6) and that a

fixed or adjustable swirl vane insert (9), which is connected with a displacement body (10)
fastened to the core air pipe (3), is arranged within the primary air pipe (6).
Burner according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised thereby that a device for
breaking away the powder concentration in the rim region of the primary air pipe (6) is

arranged at the outlet end of the primary air pipe (6).
Burner according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised thereby that the secondary
air pipe (12) is surrounded by a tertiary air pipe (13) conducting tertiary air and that the

secondary air pipe (12) projects beyond the tertiary air pipe (13) in axial direction.
Burner according to claim 9, characterised thereby that a fixed or adjustable swirl
body is arranged in the tertiary air pipe (13).
Burner according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised thereby that the flow
guidance device (26) projects beyond the secondary air pipe (12) in axial direction.
Burner according to claims 8 and 11, characterised thereby that the outer edges of
the tertiary air pipe (13), the secondary air pipe (12) and the flow guidance device (26) lie

on a circular cone surface, the apex (31) of which points in flow direction and the sector
angle of which amounts to 40 to 60째.
