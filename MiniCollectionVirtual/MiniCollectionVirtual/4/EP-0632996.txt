<ABSTRACT>
A device and method for performing a skin biopsy 
procedure, said device comprising a syringe 21 having a 

detachable needle 25 and a thin sharp cylindrical punch 22 
mounted on the same end of the syringe 21 as the needle 25, 

the punch being only available for excising a specimen for 
analysis from a patient when said needle is removed from the 

end of the syringe. The syringe is used to inject a local 
anaesthetic whereafter the needle is removed to expose the 

biopsy punch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical devices and more
particularly to a disposable device for performing skin
biopsies.A skin biopsy is used for diagnosing a skin disorder.
The current method for performing a skin biopsy is to
anaesthetize a biopsy site with a syringe, excise a small
cylindrical specimen with a small circular punch for analysis
at a pathology laboratory and repair the biopsy site with
sutures or butterfly bandages.The disadvantages with the current method is that it
requires several devices, hemostasis and repair of the biopsy
site. Moreover, it is time consuming, exposes medical
personnel to infection, and because of excessive handling,
sometimes damages the excised specimen. Another disadvantage
is that there is a likelihood of inducing excessive scar tissue
at the biopsy site from sutures or butterfly bandages. Another
disadvantage is anxiety occurs in some patients during suturing
of wounds.US-A-2,868,201 describes a needle assembly for use
with a hypodermic syringe which includes a stub cannula
surrounding the syringe needle. The cannula has a bevelled
edge to provide a point, the cannula being used for the
aspiration of fluid from the patients body. Such a device
would be quite unsuitable for skin biopsy.According to the present invention there is provided
a syringe; a detachable needle mounted on the end of the
syringe; and a thin hollow cylindrical punch having an annular
cutting edge lying in a plane extending substantially perpendicular to the axis
of the punch, said punch being mounted on the same end of the
syringe as said needle, said punch being only available for
excising a specimen for analysis from a patient when said
needle is removed from the end of said syringe.Using such a device, after a biopsy specimen has been
excised with the punch, a circular absorbable sponge of the
same diameter as the biopsy specimen may be implanted into the
biopsy site with the syringe. In one embodiment 
the circular sponge is cut from a pad with the biopsy punch.In a second embodiment of the invention a small pre-formed
surgical sponge is stored in the punch and implanted into a biopsy
site with the syringe.Fig. 1 is an end view of a biopsy device according to the
present invention.Fig. 2 is a front view of the biopsy device.Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken on the line 3-3 in Fig.

<CLAIMS>
A device for performing a skin biopsy procedure
comprising, in combination, a syringe (21); a detachable needle

(25) mounted on the end of the syringe; and a thin hollow
cylindrical punch (22) having an annular cutting edge (27)

lying in a plane extending substantially perpendicular to the axis of the punch
said punch being mounted on the same end of the syringe as said

needle, said punch being only available for excising a specimen
for analysis from a patient when said needle is removed from

the end of said syringe.
A device according to claim 1, further comprising an
open cell sponge (26) for repairing a site from which said

specimen has been excised.
A device according to claim 2, wherein said sponge
is a pre-cut cylindrical sponge stored in the interior of said

punch.
A device according to claim 2 or 3, wherein said
sponge is a porous and pliable product made from purified pork

skin.
A device according to any preceding claim, further
comprising a means (24) for removing said needle from the end

of said syringe.
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein
said syringe has a transparent body (28), a plunger (29)

slideably mounted on said body, said plunger having one end
portion which is adapted for extracting said specimen from a

biopsy punch and a seal (33) mounted at an intermediate
position on said plunger.
A device according to claim 6, wherein the punch is
made from the same piece as said body. 
A device according to claim 6 or 7, further
comprising a plurality of sharp serrations (53) at an end

portion of said punch.
