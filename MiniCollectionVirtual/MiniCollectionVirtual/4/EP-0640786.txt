<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a combined threaded connection for cable and hose, comprising a double nipple with sealing insert and pressure screw as a threaded cable-clamping connection as well as a clamping device for a sheathing hose, which threaded connection, while exhibiting an improved sealing action, exhibits a considerably reduced overall length, it is proposed that there be inserted into the pressure screw (3) a transversely slotted clamping ring (2) which exhibits, at its end directed towards the sealing insert (4), an oblique flank (6) and, at its end directed away from the sealing insert (4), an oblique flank (7) as clamping edge for a hose (1) and radially outwardly exhibits a convex region (8) which engages through a radially inwardly directed collar (9), at that end of the pressure screw (3) directed away from the sealing insert (4), and can be forced radially inwards when the pressure screw (3) is tightened.

Combined threaded connection for hose and cable, 
comprising a double nipple with sealing insert and 

clamping screw as threaded cable clamp as well as a 
clamping device for a sheathing hose, characterized in 

that there is inserted in the clamping screw (3) a 
transversely slotted clamping ring (2) which has, in a 

radially inner position at its end adjacent to the 
sealing insert (4), an inclined edge (6) or crowned edge 

which acts on the sealing insert (4) when the clamping 
screw (3) is tightened up, in that the clamping ring (2) 

has, in a radially inner position at its end remote from 
the sealing insert (4), an inclined edge (7) as feed-in 

aid and clamping edge for an inserted hose (1) which 
extends up to the sealing insert (4), and has, in a 

radially outer position, a crowned or inclined region (8) 
which engages through a collar (9), which is directed 

radially inwardly at that end of the clamping screw (3) 
which is remote from the sealing insert (4), and which 

can be forced radially inwardly when the clamping screw 
(3) is tightened up. 
Combined threaded connection for hose and cable 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the clamping 

ring (2) is composed of resilient material and can be 
pushed onto the end of a hose (1) inserted into the 

threaded connection to form a press fit, under which 
circumstances the clamping ring slot (10) is completely 

or at least almost completely closed when the clamping 
screw (3) is tightened up.  

 
Combined threaded connection for hose and cable 
according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the hose 

(1) is formed as a corrugated hose having annular raised 
sections (11) and grooves (12) and the snap ring (2) can 

be locked into the first groove (12), bounded by two 
raised sections (11), of the corrugated hose end by means 

of the radially inwardly directed terminal edge (at 7) of 
the clamping edge. 
Combined threaded connection for hose and cable 
according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 

the clamping ring (2) has straight inclined or labyrinthtype 
ends.
