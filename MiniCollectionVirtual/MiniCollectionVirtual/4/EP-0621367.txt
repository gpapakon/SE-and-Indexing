<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is an ink-jet printing process 
comprising at least the steps of: 


(a) successively applying, as ink droplets, at least 
two inks of different colors to a cloth to form a color-mixed 

portion; 
(b) subjecting the cloth to a heat treatment to fix 
dyes contained in the inks to the cloth; and 
(c) washing the cloth to remove unfixed dyes from 
the cloth, 
 
wherein the inks comprise water, an organic solvent and 

individual reactive dyes different from each other in 
reaction rate, and the volume of a droplet of the ink 

containing a slower-reacting dye is made smaller upon the 
application of the inks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a textile printing
technique according to ink-jet system.At present, textile printing is principally
conducted by screen printing or roller printing. Both
methods are unfit for multi-kind small-quantity production
and difficult to quickly cope with the fashion of the day.
Therefore, there has recently been a demand for
development of an electronic printing system making no use
of any plate. In compliance with this demand, many
textile printing processes according to ink-jet recording
have been proposed. Various fields expect much from such
textile printing processes.As necessary conditions required for ink-jet textile
printing, may be mentioned the following:
(1) being able to achieve sufficient color depth
upon coloring of ink;(2) being able to provide a print high in color
yield of dye on cloth and free from staining on white
area, and to conduct waste water treatment after
completion of washing with ease; (3) causing little irregular bleeding due to color
mixing between inks of different colors on cloth(4) being able to achieve color reproduction within
a wide range; and(5) being able to achieve stable coloring upon
fixing treatment.In order to satisfy these requirements, it has been
principally conducted to add various additives to ink or
to subject cloth to pretreatment. However, such methods
have failed to satisfy all the above requirements at the
same time.As an illustrative method for satisfying the
requirement (3) though it is not applied to cloth, may be
mentioned a method in which shot of inks is conducted in
particular order of lightness, as described in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 62-161541. In the case
of cloth, it is however impossible to satisfy the
requirement (3) because color yields of inks making use of
reactive dyes vary depending upon their reaction rates
when the inks are shot on the cloth in order of initial
lightness inherent in each ink.Further, the textile printing requires a fixing
process and, as a final step, a washing process in which
unfixed dyes attached to cloth are removed. It is
therefore necessary to handle in a manner different from
that in conventional recording on the common paper so as 
to cope with the requirement (2) described above.In particular, in the case of ink-jet textile
printing, the amount per unit area of dyes applied to
cloth is less than in conventional textile printing
processes. Therefore, a delicate difference in conditions
in the fixing process greatly affects coloring ability,
resulting in raising
