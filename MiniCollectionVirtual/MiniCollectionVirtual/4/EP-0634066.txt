<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a 1.6 to 3 GHz oscillator with a voltage-controlled resonator unit (10) in an oscillator stage (20) plus a series-connected buffer stage (30). This oscillator is designed with an open microstrip resonator (S1) which is shorter than lambda/4 in combination with an open feedback-type microstrip (S2) in the emitter branch of a common collector configuration in a non-overdriven oscillator transistor (T1). The resonator (S1) is coupled in particular with parasitic resonant circuits by a variable-capacitance diode (D1). A particularly simple and robust circuit with high output power can thus be designed for this difficult frequency range. A circuit can be built using SMD techniques to fit in a standard chassis without the need for any special adjustment measures, in particular in volume manufacture.
