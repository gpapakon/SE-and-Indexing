<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for deriving wellbore azimuth in a 
manner which reduces the impact of axial magnetic field errors, which 

utilizes a plurality of estimates of the axial component of the magnetic field 
which are combined in a manner which emphasizes the better estimates 

and deemphasizes the poorer estimates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to survey operations
in an oil and gas wellbore, and in particular relates to techniques for
obtaining more accurate magnetometer data.In order to understand the present invention, it is important to
establish the definitions of terminology utilized in wellbore survey operations.
Surveys are used to determine the position of a wellbore within the earth.
The orientation of the wellbore is determined at a particular depth by the
deviation of the wellbore from a predetermined axis. The deviations may be
measured with respect to two reference vectors:
(1) the earth's gravitational field vector "G"; and(2) the earth's magnetic field vector "H".
In accordance with this convention, G is positive in the vertical downward
direction, while H is positive in the north direction and is inclined by a dip
angle D below the horizon, as is shown in Figure 1.In the frame of reference established by the earth's
gravitational field vector G, the deviation is identified as an inclination "I"
angle, which is the angle between the longitudinal axis of the drillstring and
the earth's gravitational field vector G. In the frame of reference established
by the earth's magnetic field vector H, the deviation is identified as a
magnetic azimuth "A", which is the angle between the horizontal component
of the longitudinal axis of the drillstring and the horizontal component of the
earth's magnetic field vector H. Wellbore survey operations also frequently utilize the dip angle
"D", which is the complement of the angle between the earth's magnetic field
vector H and the earth's gravitational field vector G (that is, 90 degrees less
the angle between vectors H and G). The dip angle D is available in look-up
tables for all latitudes and longitudes on the earth's surface.In conventional wellbore survey operations, accelerometers are
utilized to measure the direction of the earth's gravitational field vector G,
and magnetometers are utilized to measure the earth's magnetic field vector
H. Each vector, includes x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis components.In the prior art, EP-A-0 384 537 describes a
method for determining the azimuth and inclination of
a borehole relating to normalisation of sensor
outputs, whilst US-A-4 709 486 teaches a method of
determining the orientation of a surveying instrument
in a borehole which requires that each Hz be calculated
from a non-colinear orientation with the Hz to which it
is compared. Neither of these references discloses or
suggests calculating directly,
