<ABSTRACT>
A miniature and high performance antenna applicable to 
a radio communication apparatus and made up of a straight 

antenna rod and an antenna coil or coil element (31). A first whip 
antenna (2) has a first portion retractable into the casing (1) of the 

apparatus and a second portion constantly positioned 
externally of the casing (1). A second whip antenna has a coil 

element in the form of a loading coil having a predetermined 
number of turns. The second whip antenna (3) is coaxially 

provided on the upper end of the first whip antenna (2) and 
slidable relative to and in the axial direction of the first 

whip antenna. The second portion of the first whip antenna is 
movable between a position where one end of the coil element 

is disengaged from one end of the second portion and a 
position where the former is engaged with the latter. The 

antenna exhibits a desirable electric characteristic when 
pulled out of the casing of the apparatus and, in addition, 

promotes the efficient use of the limited space available in 
the casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a miniature and high
performance antenna applicable to a radio communication
apparatus and made up of a straight antenna rod and an
antenna coil or coil element.Portable radio communication apparatuses, including
hand-held telephones, are extensively used today. To enhance
portability, the casing of this kind of apparatus is decreasing
in size and weight. An antenna small enough to be retracted
even into such a small casing has been proposed in various
forms. The prerequisite with the apparatus, or bidirectional
communicating means, is that it can respond to a call
originated on a remote station even when the small antenna
is retracted into the casing. Further, there is an increasing
demand for higher antenna sensitivity. In the light of this, it
has been customary to provide the apparatus with a built-in
antenna in addition to the retractable antenna and use them
selectively. However, the problem with this approach is that
the apparatus has a complicated and bulky construction. To
eliminate this problem, there has been proposed an antenna 
made up of a straight antenna rod and a short antenna having
a loading coil. In this type of antenna, the antenna rod and
short antenna are joined coaxially with each other such that
only the short antenna works when the antenna rod is held in
a retracted position.WO 92/16980 relates to an antenna construction with an extensible
antenna element. An antenna construction with a
rod-shaped antenna element is adapted for use preferably in
portable telephones. The rod-shaped antenna element is adapted
to be slidably movable in a tube between a first position
in which substantially the entire rod-shaped antenna
element protrudes from the tube and contributes to radiation,
and a second position where just part of the rod-shaped
antenna element protrudes from the tube and contributes
to radiation. The rod-shaped antenna element is adapted
to be received in the tube to provide a coaxial transmission
line. However, the conventional antenna of the type described
cannot achieve a desirable electric characteristic when the
antenna rod is pulled out of the casing of the apparatus.
Moreover, such an antenna cannot be miniature enough to
promote the effective use of a space available in the casing.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
provide an antenna for a radio communication apparatus
which exhibits an improved electric characteristic when a
straight antenna rod is extended from the casing of the
apparatus.It is another object

<CLAIMS>
An antenna for a radio communication apparatus,
comprising:


a first whip antenna (2) baving a first portion retractable
into a casing (1) of said apparatus and a second portion

constantly positioned externally of said casing; and
a second whip antenna (3) having a coil element (31) in the form
of a loading coil having a predetermined number of turns, said

second whip antenna (3) being coaxially provided on an upper end
of said first whip antenna (2),

characterized in that said second whip antenna is slidable relative to and in an
axial direction of said first whip antenna (2) such that said

second portion of said first whip antenna is movable between
a position where one end of said coil element i
s disengaged
from one end of said second portion and a position where said

one end of said coil element is engaged with said one end of
said second portion.
An antenna as claimed in claim 1, wherein said coil
element (31) of said second whip antenna (3) is disposed in a case (30) made

of synthetic resin, said case (30) having a bore (33) coaxial with said
loading coil.
An antenna as claimed in claim 2, wherein said second
portion of said first whip antenna (2) has a greater diameter than

said first portion and is slidably received in said bore (33) of said
case 30. 
An antenna as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said first
whip antenna (2) has a telescopic rod antenna structure.
