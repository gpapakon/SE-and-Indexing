<ABSTRACT>
A velocity estimation technique is provided for a 
pulse-echo ultrasonic diagnostic system in which a two 

dimensional array of samples is acquired from a sample 
volume. The two dimensions of the array are depth, in 

which echo signal samples are acquired in response to 
transmission of a pulse to the sample volume, and pulse 

time, in which samples are acquired in response to 
transmission of the pulses in the pulse ensemble to the 

sample volume. Two autocorrelation calculations are 
performed on the array, one in the depth dimension and 

another in the pulse time dimension to yield two 
correlation functions, the first related to echo 

frequency and the second related to the Doppler 
frequency. The two correlation functions are then 

employed in a Doppler velocity estimation to determine 
the velocity of motion at the sample volume. The 

technique utilizes the full information content present 
in the bandwidth of the received echo signals, thereby 

overcoming inaccuracies due to depth dependent frequency 
decline or coherent signal cancellation. Since accuracy 

is premised upon the number of samples in the array and 
not its size in a particular dimension, performance can 

be tailored to favor frame rate or axial resolution 
while maintaining the accuracy of velocity estimation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ultrasonic diagnostic
systems which measure the flow of fluids by pulsed
Doppler interrogation and, in particular, to the
processing of pulsed Doppler information signals
using two dimensional autocorrelation.The patent U,S-5,228,009 (Forestieri et alii)
discloses an apparatus and a method for elimination
of undesirable clutter signals from desirable
signals. This is performed without the use of
filters by subtracting orthogonal basis functions
from signal samples until the appropriate degree of
clutter removal is achieved. Estimates of Doppler
shifts due to fluid flow may be achieved with
superior discrimination of true flow signals from
sources of clutter or artifact, greater sensitivity
to low flow rates, minimal computation effort and
with few samples.Ultrasonic diagnostic systems which measure the
flow of fluids through Doppler interrogation are in
widespread use for the acquisition of medical patient
data concerning the flow of blood and other fluids in
the body. Doppler flow measurement systems may be
characterized on the basis of the technique of
ultrasonic wave transmission employed, which may be
either continuous or pulsed wave transmission. In a
continuous wave Doppler system a wave of ultrasonic
energy is continuously transmitted toward the target
area. Returning echo signals are compared in phase
or frequency to the transmitted wave with the shift
in phase or frequency being proportionate to the
velocity of the target along the axis of 
transmission. In a pulsed Doppler system a sequence
of ultrasonic wave pulses are transmitted toward the
target area and the relative phase or frequency shift
from one echo to another is calculated and is
proportional to the velocity of fluid flow. The
Doppler frequency shift fD is given by the Doppler
velocity equation
fD = 2V cosÓúçC fo
where fo is the frequency of the ultrasonic wave
applied to the target, V is the velocity of the
target which produced the echo, 0 is the angle of the
axis of transmission relative to the direction of
motion of the target, and C is the propagation
velocity of the transmitted pulse . From this
equation it is seen that the Doppler frequency shift
fD is proportional to the velocity V of the moving
target.In pulsed Doppler systems the returning echo
signals are generally not compared in phase or
frequency to a specific continuous reference signal.
Instead, the Doppler frequency information manifests
itself in the repetition of the transmitted pulses,
which are transmitted at sampling times Ts and
exhibit
