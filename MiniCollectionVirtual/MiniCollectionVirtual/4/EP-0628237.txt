<ABSTRACT>
The mower comprises a draw bar (4) which is vertically 
pivotable about an axis (5) close to the vertical 

centre plane of the mower in the driving direction during 
operation, driving wheels (2,3) for carrying the mower 

during operation and transport wheels (14) for carrying the 
mower during transport in a position substantially perpendicular 

to the operational position. The transport wheels (14) 
are mounted at the end of each their carrier arm (15), which 

is mounted pivotally in such a way that the transport 
wheels (14) are movable between an active position, in which 

they carry the mover, and an inactive position, in which 
they do not impede the movement of the draw bar (4) in 

relation to the mower. The carrier arms (15) are mounted on 
either side of the draw bar (4), and the carrier arms are in 

the inactive position of the transport wheels (14) adapted 
to extend backwards.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mower comprising a 
draw bar which is vertically pivotable about an axis close 
to the vertical centre plane of the mower in the driving 
direction during operation, driving wheels for carrying the 
mower during operation and transport wheels for carrying the 
mower during transport in a position substantially perpendicular 
to the operational position, the transport wheels 
being mounted at the end of each their carrier arm, which is 
mounted pivotally in such a way that the transport wheels 
are movable between an active position, in which they carry 
the mower, and an inactive position, in which they do not 
impede the movement of the draw bar in relation to the 
mower. US Patent No. 4 986 064 discloses a mower of the 
above type, in which the carrier arms are mounted on the 
mower itself, in front and at the rear thereof, respectively, 
and in the inactive positions of the driving wheels said 
carrier arms extend forwards and backwards, respectively, in 
relation to the mower. In mowers with a draw bar which is pivotal around an 
axis close to the vertical centre plane of the mower in the 
driving direction during operation and with driving wheels 
for carrying the mower during operation, it is a common 
problem that the point of gravity of the mower during 
operation will be close to a line between the point of 
mounting point of the draw bar on a tractor and the driving 
wheel farthest away from the track of the tractor. The mower 
is therefore inclined to tilt forwards. It is known to avoid 
this by placing a ballast at the other driving wheel. It is, 
however, clearly a disadvantage to make the mower more heavy 
than necessary considering its functioning as a mower. The object of the invention is, therefore, to provide 
a mower of the type mentioned by way of introduction, said 
mower not suffering from the above general disadvantage in 
mowers with a pivotable draw bar. The object is met by means of a mower according to claim 1.  
 Hereby is achieved that the transport wheels, when in 
their inactive position, contribute to moving the point of 
gravity of the mower backwards, the stability of the mower 
being thus improved. In a preferred embodiment the carrier arms are mounted 
pivotally about a common shaft substantially perpendicular 
to the draw bar. The transport wheels are preferably controllable when 
in their active position. Thereby an improved manoeuvrability 
is attained. The invention will be explained in detail in the following 
with reference to

<CLAIMS>
A mower comprising a draw bar (4) which is vertically 
pivotable about an axis (5) close to the vertical centre 

plane of the mower in the driving direction during 
operation, driving wheels (2,3) for carrying the mower 

during operation and transport wheels (14) for carrying the 
mower during transport in a position substantially perpendicular 

to the operational position, the transport wheels (14) 
being mounted at the end of each their carrier arm (15), 

which is mounted pivotally in such a way that the transport 
wheels (14) are movable between an active position, in which 

they carry the mover, and an inactive position, in which 
they do not impede the movement of the draw bar (4) in 

relation to the mower, 
characterized
 in that 
the carrier arms (15) are mounted on either side of the draw 

bar (4) and adapted to extend backwards in the inactive position 
of the transport wheels such that the carrier arms and the 

transport wheels in their inactive position 
contribute to moving the point of gravity of the mower backwards, 

such that the tendency of forwards tilting of the mower is reduced 
or removed.  

 
A mower according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the carrier arms (15) are mounted pivotally 

about a common shaft (16) substantially perpencidular to the 
draw bar (4). 
A mower according to claims 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the transport wheels in their active 

position are controllably pivotal.
