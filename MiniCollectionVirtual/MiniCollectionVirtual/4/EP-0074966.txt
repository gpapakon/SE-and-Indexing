<ABSTRACT>
The filtering device constructed according to a modular system comprises filtering plates (3) interassembled, said plates being used either to form a U-shaped gutter, or as a simple plate for a small filter, or as a replacement for a separation channel or as a horizontal filter. The cleaning of the filtering plates is effected on both sides by means of moving conduits spraying (7) and collecting the slurries (8). The upper surface of the filter is divided in small boxes (14) sealed on all sides by a support grid (2) so that the cleaning flow goes necessarily through the corresponding area of the filter. The collection of slurries is effected in a slurry collecting conduit (8) facing the spraying conduit.
