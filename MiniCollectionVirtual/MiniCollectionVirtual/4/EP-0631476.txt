<ABSTRACT>
A device for mixing and/or kneading dough comprises a frame (1) into which a container for the dough to be processed can be introduced by means of a truck (22). One introduced into the frame, the container (17) can be raised by means of a lifting device (23) into a position in which at least one tool (15) protrudes into it from above. Each tool (15) is located eccentrically in relation to the axis (42) of the container and mounted on a tool carrier (4) which can be rotated about the axis (42) under the action of a drive (51). In addition, another drive (50) is provided for the tools (15) which move in relation to the tool carrier (4). The latter is mounted at its circumference rotatably on a collar (2) of the frame and acts as a lid closing off the top opening of the container (17) in its raised position. A particularly intensive and even mixing of the dough in the container (17) is thereby achieved and the stress on the container (17) is reduced.

Apparatus for stirring and/or kneading dough, comprising 
a support (1) having receiving means (2) into which a 

container (17) for dough is insertable, and wherein the container 
(17), when inserted, is liftable along guides (40) by 

lifting means (23) into a position in which at least one tool 
(15) carried by the support (1) for stirring and/or kneading 

dough immerges into the container (17) which is unrotatable in 
this position, each tool (15) being driven by driving means 

(50) carried by the support (1) to exert a rotating or kneading 
movement, and at least one tool (15) being movably mounted in a 

tool support (4) in an eccentric manner relative to the axis 
(42) of the container (17), said tool support (4) being rotatable 

by drive means (51) relative to the container (17) about 
the axis (42) thereof and in the lifted position of the container 

(17) forming a covering lid for the upper opening (18) 
of the container (17), said support (1) having a rim (2) towards 

which the periphery portion (29) of the upper opening 
(18) of the container (17) is lifted to reach its lifted position, 

characterized in that the circumference of the tool 
support (4) is rotatably mounted on said rim (2). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the tool support (4) extends in a pot-like manner from above 

down into the rim (2), a cylindrical wall thereof being rotatably 
mounted by journal means (3) on a wall of the rim (2) 

being also cylindrical. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that individual drive means (51 and 50) are provided for the 

rotational movement of the tool support (4) as well as for the 
movement of the tools (15) relative to the tool support (4). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the tool support (4) carries gear means (7) for the movement of 

the tools (15) which includes a drive shaft (8) extending along 
the axis (42) of the container (17), said drive shaft being 

driven, preferably by means of a V-belt, by a motor (10) supported 
by the support (1).  

 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that 
the tool support (4) has at least one opening (21) in its bottom 

(6) which is situated eccentrically to the axis (42) of the 
container (17), and which is penetrated by one tool's (15) 

shaft (14) extending parallely to the axis (42) of the container 
(17), preferably arranging journal means thereon, said 

shaft (14) being an output shaft of the gear means (7). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that 
the tool support (4) has at least one slot (48) at its bottom 

(6) which is penetrated by a tool (159), the upper end of which 
is pivoted to a crank (44) at the output shaft (149) of the 

gear means (7), whereas below it is pivoted to a coupler (46) 
pivotally connected to the tool support (4). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the remaining residual portion of each slot is covered by bellows. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that at least two tools (15) are provided which have different 

operating positions at all times. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that 
two tools (15) are respectively pivoted to two cranks (44) 

driven in opposite directions. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the lifting means (23) comprises a fork or an 

U-shaped structure, the container (17) being insertable into 
its legs (28), clamping means (31) for the upper periphery 

portion (29) of the container (17) being provided thereon. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 10, characterized in 
that the clamping means (31) comprises at least two brackets 

(32) engaging over the periphery portion (29) of the container 
(17) which, in lifted position of the container (17), are 

pressed against the periphery portion (29) of the container 
(17) by springs (33), but with extensions (35) engaging detent 

means (36) of the rim (2), in this position being lifted 
against the action of the springs (33), thus releasing the 

periphery portion (29) of the container (17).  
 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 10 or 11, characterized 
in that the brackets (32) and/or the periphery portion (29) of 

the container (17) are provided with inclined surfaces (37) for 
centring the container (17) 
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that the container (17) is provided with an 

undercarriage (22).
