<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a production process for a polycarbonate film.Polycarbonate film has been used in packaging, optical
devices, display devices and other various applications in
industry. Recently increasing attention has been paid to the
film as a material for optoelectronic devices, and the
practical application has been forwarded in retardation
plates, polarization plates, plastic substrate, for example,
in liquid crystal displays. Particularly, in the most remarkably
progressing STN liquid crystal displays, the polycarbonate
film is attracting attention as a phase-difference
layer used in the space between the liquid crystal layer and
the polarization layer for improving the image visibility,
when it is seen from the front and oblique positions. This
phase difference film plays a role of converting the elliptically
polarized light passing through the liquid crystal
layer into the linearly polarized light, and the material is
composed of a monoaxially oriented polycarbonate film mainly
from bisphenol-A. The reasons why the film is used are that
it has excellent properties which the phase-different plates
are required for, for example, (1) high transparency, (2)
optical anisotropy relatively easy to be controlled, (3)
relatively high heat resistance, and (4) high uniformity.But, the film of polycarbonate from bisphenol-A also 
has disadvantages. In general, this film is produced by
casting a bisphenol-A polycarbonate solution in methylene
chloride in order to attain the high level of uniformity,
but the film for phase different plates or liquid crystal
base plates is thick and requires to be cast from dope of
high polymer concentration. But, the solubility of the
polymer is about 20 % by weight, not always adequately high.
Moreover, the polymer cannot be stable in the dope of high
concentration, and frequently causes cloudiness or gelation
due to crystallization with the passage of time, especially
the crystallization occurs during the film-making process in
many cases.Further, the film used in these optoelectronic devices
is required as an electronic part not to give adverse effect
on the surrounding parts, for example, not to develop chloride
ions by decomposition caused by exposure to the atmospheres
of high temperature and high humidity for a long
period of time. Customarily, the cast polycarbonate film
from the solution in methylene chloride is used for such an
optical purpose, as mentioned above, but it is difficult to
say that this polycarbonate film satisfactorily meets these
req
