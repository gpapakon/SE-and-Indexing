<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of welding the outer surface (5a) 
of a pipe (5) and the wall (4) of a cylindrical seat (5) for housing 

the pipe (5), the method providing, amongst its successive 
operative steps, for the step of providing vacuum and sealing a 

substantially tubular space (S) between the wall (4) and the 
surface (5a), followed by the step of the combined internal 

pressurization and heating of the pipe (5). The desired weld is 
thus formed and the accumulation in the space (S) of air which, 

once the pipe expands radially as a result of the pressurization 
and the heating, would be compressed within it and would oppose 

the aforesaid expansion, is prevented. Owing to its simplicity and 
flexibility, the method of the invention can be used either for 

welding one pipe at a time, or for welding a plurality of pipes 
simultaneously, as occurs during the formation of heat-exchanger 

elements. In the latter case, the spaces (S) of the various pipes 
(5) are sealed with the aid of a metal foil which is wrapped around 

the exchange element to form a covering thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of welding the outer
surface of a pipe and the wall of a cylindrical housing seat in
which the pipe is inserted, a substantially tubular space being
defined between the outer surface and the wall.In order to better define the field of application of the invention,
it is useful to point out that it is suitable in particular, but not
exclusively, for the manufacture of heat-exchanger elements. The
latter are already known and used as components for the
transmission of heat in various plants for producing electrical
energy; such an element is constituted essentially by a panel
which may be plate-shaped or of another geometrical configuration,
for example cylindrical, etc., in which cylindrical seats are formed
side by side for housing pipes through which a fluid, that
depending on the purpose of the plant may be a cooling or a
heating fluid, is transported.An important property required to these heat-exchanger elements
is to conduct heat effectively and constantly; in order to satisfy
this requirement, the quality of the weld between the pipes for 
transporting the fluid and the walls of the seats in which they are
housed assumes critical importance. Currently, a technique used
for producing heat-exchanger elements is that of subjecting the
panel with the pipes inserted therein to a brazing process; that
is, additional material which is first interposed between the pipe
and the wall of its seat, is melted as a result of a heating cycle,
giving rise to the joint between the pipe and the wall.Before continuing further, it is appropriate to state that, in this
description and in the claims which follow, the term weld is
intended to indicate, in the most general sense, the continuous
joint between two elements or surfaces which are disposed side
by side and may even be heterogeneous and not solely metallic;
as well as the brazing just described, the joint may also be
brought about as a result of the local fusion of the elements or
surfaces disposed side by side, or by braze-welding, or in some
other manner, having regard to the specifications of the Italian
standards (UNI) on the subject.The known technique mentioned above has several disadvantages,
however, which make its performance unsatisfactory, particularly
when considering the relevance of the uses to which the exchanger
elements may be put when, for example, they are used in nuclear
technology. Indeed, amongst the most important disadvantages, it should be
noted that, as a result of the heat treatment undergone

which the pipe is inserted, a substantially tubular space (S)
being defined between the outer surface (5a) and the wall (4),

the method comprising the steps of:

providing vacuum in the space (S), and sealing it,
bringing about combined heating and internal
pressurization of the pipe (5), thereby producing the weld as

a result of the plastic deformation of the pipe (5) by the

brought about in an isostatic press (10).
A method of welding outer surfaces (5a) of a plurality
of pipes (5) and corresponding walls (4) of respective housing

seats (3) in which the pipes (5) are inserted, respective
substantially tubular spaces (S) being defined between the

outer surfaces (5a) and the corresponding walls (4),
characterized in that it comprises the following operative

steps:

covering the pipes (5) and the seats (3) in which they
are inserted, externally, with a metal foil (6), forming a 

wrapping which covers the pipes (5) and the seats (3), leaving
the pipes (5) internally in communication with the exterior,
providing vacuum in the wrapping formed by the foil (6)
and sealing it,
bringing about combined heating and internal
pressurization of said pipes (5) and seats (3) covered by said

foil (6) by means of an isostatic press (10), thereby

characterized in that additional brazing material is

interposed in the space (S) defined between the outer surface
(5a) of at least one pipe (5) and the wall (4) of the

corresponding seat (3) for housing the pipe (5).
