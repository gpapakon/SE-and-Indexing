<ABSTRACT>
A flat belt (1) is rolled up into a tubular shape in 
which material is wrapped and conveyed between a pair of 

pulleys (2). While the belt (1) is transformed from a tubular 
shape to a flat shape and vice versa, the belt passes 

through guide rollers (9) in guide frames (8). The guide roller (9) 
is provided to go away from a straight line (L) between the 

outer circumferences of the pulleys (2), thereby preventing 
the belt (1) from biasing or folding back. Also, a dummy 

pulley (34) and expansion rollers (31) are provided while the belt (1) 
is transformed between tubular and flat shapes, thereby 

achieving the same results.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tubular belt 
conveyor in which an endless conveyor belt is rolled up 
into a tubular form in which material is wrapped and 
conveyed. With respect to Fig. 4 to 7, a conventional 
tubular belt conveyor will be described, in which an 
endless conveyor belt 1 is rolled out to a flat shape 
which is wound around a pair of pulleys 2 and 3, and is 
circulated by rotating any of the pulleys 2 and 3 by drive 
means such as a motor (not shown). Going and returning 
paths 1a and 1b of the conveyor belt 12 pass through 
openings 5c in the middle of upper and lower chambers 5a 
and 5b of a plurality of shape-maintaining frames 5 fixed 
to support frame 5 at a certain distance along a conveying 
direction between the pulleys 2 and 3, and the belt 1 is 
rolled up to a tubular form by a plurality of shape-maintaining 
rollers 6 around the opening 5c. As shown in Fig. 4, in trough transforming 
sections "A", "A'", "B" and "B'" in which the conveyor 
belt 1 is rolled up into a tubular shape from a flat shape 
wound on one of the pulleys 2 and 3, or is rolled out from 
a tubular shape into a flat shape wound on the other of 
pulleys 2 and 3, the conveyor belt 1 is guided by guide 
rollers 9 pivoted to a plurality of guide frames 8 fixed 
to frames 7 which extend from the ends of the support 
frame 4. As shown in Fig. 6, while the conveyor belt 1 
which is rolled out to a flat shape and rotates around the 
rear pulley 3 is rolled up through the guide frames 8 of 
the trough transforming section "A", it encloses material 
11 thrown from a supply hopper 10. Then, the belt 1 
passes through the upper opening 5c of each of the shape-maintaining 
frames 5 and is rolled out to a flat shape  
 
while it passes through the guide frame 8 in the trough 
transforming section "B". When the belt 1 is rotated 
around the front pulley 2, the material 11 is thrown onto 
a receiving hopper 12, and then, it is rolled up into a 
tubular shape again in the trough transforming section 
"A'" and passes through the lower opening 5c of the guide 
frame 5. It is rolled out to a flat shape in the trough 
transforming section "B'" and circulated around the rear 
pulley 3. The foregoing schematically mentions structure and 
operation of such a tubular belt conveyor. In the trough 
transforming section "B" of the conventional conveyor belt 
1, as shown in Fig. 7, to extend the center and side 
edges of the unfolded conveyor belt 1 equally by pulling 
force of the front pulley 2, an extension of the central 
line of

<CLAIMS>
A tubular belt conveyor comprising: 

a pair of pulleys (2,3); 
an endless conveyor belt (1) which is wound around 
the pair of pulleys (2,3), the belt (1) being rolled up into a 

tubular shape in which material is conveyed; and 
guide rollers (9) 
for guiding the bottom of the conveyor belt (1) 

positioned adjacent to each of 
the pulleys (2,3) to transform the flat belt wound on the pulleys 

(2,3) into a tubular shape, or vice versa,
 
   charcterized in that 
the uppermost, or lowermost, part of the outer 
peripheries of the guide rollers (9) are disposed 

upwardly, or downwardly, respectively, of a straight line 
between the uppermost, or lowermost, part, respectively, 

of the outer peripheries of the pulleys (2,3), thereby 
providing uniform distribution of stresses of the belt, 

so that the side edges of the belt are wound around the 
respective pulley (2,3) or unwound therefrom with tension 

to prevent the belt from turning aside or over for smooth 
running of the belt. 
A tubular belt conveyor as defined in claim 1 
wherein there is provided a pair of pressing rollers (20) 

which press side edges of the flat conveyor belt (1) 
between the foremost guide roller (9) and the respective 

pulley (2,3). 
A tubular belt conveyor as defined in claim 2 
wherein each of the pressing rollers (20) is provided, 

adjustably in a vertical direction, on a support (8). 
A tubular belt conveyor as defined in claim 2 
wherein each of the pressing rollers (20) is provided 

adjustably in a horizontal direction.
