<ABSTRACT>
A cartoning machine for wrapping cartons (16) about objects (12) 
at high 

speed consists of a series of stations arranged one after the 
other on a frame (11). It comprises a conveying table (13) which feeds 

objects to a station for separating said objects into groups (17) and 
to a pusher conveyor (14) for the groups. Below the pusher conveyor 

is located a further conveyor (15) for feeding cartons in an 
open and flat state towards an aperture (21) provided in an advancement 

table for the group of objects. Deflector elements (38) are 
positioned in correspondence with the aperture to deviate the 

carton upwards within the pusher conveyor. The further 
conveyor is arranged inclined from the bottom upwards and can 

rotate about a pivot (22) under the action of control elements so that 
its upper end is always directed towards 

the aperture, which can be moved forwards and rearwards along the 
advancement table in phase with the end of the further conveyor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cartoning machine for wrapping cartons 
about objects at high speed. Cartoning machines of automatic operation are currently used for 
cartoning or packaging single objects or groups of objects such as 
bottles, cans etc. in a pre-punched carton formable into a box. In these machines the objects, usually arriving from an 
accumulation conveyor, are divided into the desired number and 
arrangement in a dividing station. When arranged, they are 
conveyed into a subsequent station for insertion into the pre-punched 
carton before being finally closed into its interior by 
folding and gluing the carton arranged about the objects. In known machines, downstream of the separation station there is a 
conveyor consisting of transverse bars arranged on endless chains, 
at which there is located a feed conveyor for the pre-punched 
cartons. This conveyor is provided in the lower part of the 
machine and is inclined towards an aperture provided in the table 
along which the objects travel. One or more deflector elements cause the carton to emerge from 
said aperture in such a manner that it is deviated upwards to 
facilitate its arrangement about the group of objects. In this  
 
respect, the deflector elements both cause the carton to emerge 
from the aperture and cause it to fold about preferential creasing 
lines provided on it to define its walls. In known machines there are limits to the cartoning rate in that 
the deflector elements have to be suitably correlated with the 
product advancement. In this respect, when the deflector elements 
have deviated a first carton onto a first group of objects and 
have then been retracted below the product advancement table, they 
have to wait for the end of the wall of the first carton before 
again rising to halt and deviate a second carton. To achieve this the transverse bars, arranged on the chains and 
acting as pusher elements, have to be positioned a large distance 
apart, their positioning limiting the machine speed. The object of the present invention is to provide a cartoning 
machine for wrapping cartons about objects which is able to 
operate at high speed, so reducing packaging time while still 
ensuring correct positioning of the objects within the cartons. This object is achieved according to the present invention by a 
cartoning machine for wrapping cartons about objects at high 
speed, consisting of a series of stations or units arranged one 
after the other on a frame and comprising a conveying table which 
feeds objects in

<CLAIMS>
A cartoning machine for wrapping cartons about objects at 
high speed, consisting of a series of stations or units arranged 

one after the other on a frame and comprising a conveying table 
which feeds objects in general to a station for separating or 

dividing said objects into groups and to a pusher conveyor for 
said separate groups of objects, below said pusher conveyor there 

being located a further conveyor for feeding pre-punched cartons 
in a completely open and flat state towards an aperture provided 

in an advancement table for said group of objects, deflector 
elements being positioned in correspondence with said aperture to 

deviate said pre-punched carton upwards within said pusher 
conveyor, characterised in that said further conveyor is arranged 

inclined from the bottom upwards and can rotate about a pivot 
under the action of control elements so that the upper end of said 

further conveyor is always directed towards said aperture, said 
aperture being movable forwards and rearwards along said 

advancement table in phase with said end of said further conveyor. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said aperture, variable in position along said advancement table, 

consists of a pair of surfaces arranged in succession and both 
movable forwards and rearwards along the advancement table with 

reciprocating movement. 
A machine as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that 
said pair of surfaces are arranged on a carriage, a first surface 

upstream of said aperture being formed by a plate and the second 
surface downstream of said aperture being formed by a plurality of 

 
side-by-side, spaced-apart chains. 
A machine as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that 
said carriage is caused to move reciprocatingly forwards and 

rearwards by a lever system connected to a motorized crank. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said further conveyor for feeding cartons is pivoted in an 

intermediate region to said frame and is connected by a lever 
system to an eccentric drive. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said deflector elements are operated by a lever-cam system. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said series of stations are interconnected by a series of 

transmissions driven by a central drive. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
each of said series of stations is provided with separate motors, 

sensors being associated with said stations to identify individual 
positions in time and to transmit relative signals to a computer 

which selectively controls the operation of said motors on the 
basis of a predetermined program.
