<ABSTRACT>
Improvements in steering swivel carrier parts for vehicles, 
consisting of a cylindrical metallic housing (9) open at both bases, and 

with the edge (11) of one of them being weakened into a bevel in order 
to facilitate the riveting of an internal elastic piece (1) with opening 

of diameter slightly less than that of the swivel, edges (3) shaped into 
rounded lips and with a peripheral channel (4) that increases 

flexibility. The zone (6) opposite the opening of this elastic piece has 
a hollow collar (5) with surrounding spherical zones of lesser thickness 

that increase the flexibility of the assembly. The base of this collar 
(5) has specially arranged slits (7) to provide an exit for air and 

surplus grease, thereby eliminating the possibility of the enclosed air 
causing the grease to oxidize and deteriorate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The improvements in steering swivel carrier parts 
for vehicles to which this invention refers have 
application in the automotive accessories industry, which 
supplies all manner of accessory elements in which joints 
by means of swivels are needed, achieving unsurpassable 
working conditions, application and manufacture of this 
type of joint. Swivel carrier parts for vehicle steering 
currently consist of spherical or cylindrical casings with 
spherically-shaped internal elements, the opening for which 
has to have a diameter greater than that of the swivel to 
be housed inside. This brings with it the drawback that it 
is just as easy for the swivel to come out of its housing 
as it is for it to go in. Internal pads attached to the inside of the 
housing have been used with an opening of diameter less 
than that of the swivel and with an elasticity that allows 
the swivel to be forced inside. But it is very difficult to 
remove. This kind of elastic element, however, has the 
drawback that, when it is totally sealed, even though it is 
providing elasticity to the swivel unit, the air remains 
inside, which tends to cause grease to become oxidized and 
hardened. The assembly then wears out prematurely. Similarly, the location of these internal pads has 
its drawbacks in terms of sealing the upper and lower 
openings of the housing containing them once they have been 
inserted, since this is generally done by means of pressure 
and the thickness of the housing itself means that the rim 
left facing the inside is not regular and the piece has to 
be machined, which increasees manufacturing costs.  All these drawbacks that have existed to date are 
solved by the improvements referred to in this invention. Improvements in steering swivel carrier parts for 
vehicles, specially formed by means of a cylindrical-shaped 
external housing created with open bases, one of them 
having a bevel that decreases the thickness of the edge 
and, since the opposite base is of greater thickness, this 
is forced by means of pressure to fold towards the interior 
in order leave a diameter slightly greater than that of the 
swivel that is to be housed in it. Inside this housing is a piece consisting of a 
bush made from an elastic material of suitable resistance, 
with an external diameter equal to the internal diameter of 
the housing, and with a spherical internal surface equal in 
shape to that of the swivel to be housed inside. This piece 
has an opening slightly smaller than the diameter of the 
swivel, with rounded

Improvements in steering swivel carrier parts for 
vehicles, characterized by the provision of a housing in 

which the swivel is inserted, the housing consisting of a 
hollow cylinder open at both bases in which one of the 

edges has been weakened into a bevel in order to facilitate 
folding towards the inside of an internal elastic piece, 

the insertion of which is restricted by the opposite base 
by means of a rim facing the interior, leaving one opening 

with a diameter slightly greater than that of the swivel to 
be introduced. 
Improvements in steering swivel carrier parts for 
vehicles, as per patent claim 1, characterized by the 

internal elastic piece consisting of an elastic and 
resistant plastic bush, cylindrically shaped externally for 

it to be seated in the housing, with an opening slightly 

smaller than that of the swivel to be inserted and with an 
internal spherical surface with edges consisting of rounded 

lips and provided with peripheral channelling close to this 
opening that increases its flexibility in order to allow 

the swivel to be inserted by means of simple pressure. 
Improvements in steering swivel carrier parts for 
vehicles, as per patent claims 1 and 2, characterized by 

the fact that the zone in the spherical surface of the 
internal bush has a hollow collar in its upper part, 

creating a spherical area around it of lesser thickness 
which increases the flexibility of the assembly so that it 

can absorb longitudinal and tangential forces. 
Improvements in steering swivel carrier parts for 
vehicles, as per patent claims 1, 2 and 3, characterized by 

the upper base of the elastic internal piece being plane 
and matching the hollow collar, and that there exists slits 

specially arranged for air and surplus grease to be 
expelled when the swivel is inserted, thereby preventing 

air from remaining inside, which could give rise to 
oxidation and hardening of the grease. 

 
As described and claimed in this descriptive Report 

consisting of eight numbered sheets typed on one side only 
and with 2 diagrams illustrating it.
