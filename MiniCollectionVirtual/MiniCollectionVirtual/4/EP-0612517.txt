<ABSTRACT>
This emulsion consists of a fatty phase containing a silicone, a non-gelled aqueous phase and an emulsifying agent chosen from an alkyl- or alkoxy-dimethicone copolyol or a dimethicone copolyol or a mixture thereof, the said fatty phase representing from 15 to 40 % by weight of the total weight of the emulsion, and consisting of at least 10 to 90 % by weight of silicone and of 0.1 to 5 % of a gelling agent consisting of a mixture of fatty acid esters of glycerol and glycol in a ratio between 75/25 and 95/5 % by weight, the said fatty acids being C16-C36 fatty acids, at least 50 % of the fatty acids being C18-C22 fatty acids. This emulsion not only has a good stability with time, but also with respect to variations in temperature.
