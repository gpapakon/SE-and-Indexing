<ABSTRACT>
Novel aromatic polyimide, polyamide and polyamide-imide gas separation membranes and the process of using such membranes to separate one or more gases from a gaseous mixture is disclosed. The polyimides, polyamides and polyamide-imides are formed from diamines of formula (I) where Ar' is (a), Q is nothing or an aromatic group and Z is independently alkyl groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, most preferably a tertiary butyl group, n is an integer from 0 to 4, preferably 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aromatic polyimide, polyamide and
polyamide-imide gas separation membranes and the process for separating
one or more gases from a gaseous mixture using such membranes. The
polyimides, polyamides and polyamide-imides are derived from diamines
which incorporate dialkyl substituted diamines in the polymer chain. The
inventive gas separation membranes exhibit exceptionally good permeation
rates with good selectivity.US-Re-30,351; US-A-3,822,202 and US-A-3,899,309 disclose gas
separation membrane materials comprising certain semi-rigid aromatic
polyimides, polyamides, and polyesters.EP-A-0 370 509 discloses composite gas separation membranes with
separating layer made of polyamidoimides and/or aromatic
polyimides.EP-A-0 424 004 discloses gas separation membranes prepared from polyaramides.US-A-4,240,914; US-A-4,358,378; US-A-4,385,084 and US-A-4,410,568
disclose an asymmetric polyimide gas separation membrane prepared from
an aliphatic polyimide material.US-A-4,307,135 and EP-A-0 488 341 disclose the preparation of an asymmetric polyimide
membrane from a soluble polyimide.US-A-4,378,324; US-A-4,460,526; US-A-4,474,662; US-A-4,485,056, US-A-4,512,893,
EP-A-0 391 699 disclose a process for preparing asymmetric polyimide membranes.US-A-4,378,400 discloses polyimide gas separation materials which
incorporate 3,3,4,4,-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride residues.US-A-4,705,540 and EP-A-0 400 811 disclose aromatic polyimide gas separation membrane
materials based on rigid polyimides.US-A-4,485,140; US-A-4,696,994; US-A-4,725,642 and US-A-4,758,875
teach the incorporation of diamines, shown below, into polyimide materials:
The present invention relates to certain polyimide, polyamide and
polyamide-imide separation membranes as defined in claims 1, 8 and 12
particularly useful for separating
gases and the gas separation processes for using them, as defined in claims 7, 11 and 17
This class of membrane materials
compositionally contain certain diamines which incorporate di-t-bytyl substituted
aromatic units in the polymer chain. Membranes formed from this class of
polyimide materials exhibit superior gas permeability and good selectivity. It
is believed that the high permeabilities of some gases from multicomponent
mixtures is due to the molecular free volume in the polymer which is created
by the alkyl substituents on the diamines.The present invention relates to the discovery that gas separation
membranes exhibiting exceptional gas permeability can be obtained by
forming such gas
