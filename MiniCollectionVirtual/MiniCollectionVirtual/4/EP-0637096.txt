<ABSTRACT>
A planar antenna, intended for reception of the Direct 
Satellite Communication television signals, having a novel 

structure and improved performance, comprises an array of M x 
N helical antenna elements, each of the helical antenna 

elements including a helical antenna and a straight stem end 
portion attached thereto; a first dielectric layer (20) provided 

with M x N array of through holes, each through hole extending 
from the top thereof to the bottom thereof; a second 

dielectric layer (40) provided with a strip line feeder pattern on 
top thereof; an output probe (70) coupled to the strip line feeder 

pattern to thereby output the combined output signals; and a 
protective cover (80). Each of the helical antennas is coupled to 

the strip line feeder pattern through the straight stem end 
portion attached thereto and passes through the through hole 

to thereby support thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a planar antenna for the
reception of Direct Broadcast Satellite(DBS) television
signals; and, more particularly, to an improved planar antenar
for providing higher aperture efficiency, improved
polarization and increased production tolerability.Reception of direct broadcast satellite signals having 12
GHz carrier frequency requires a circularly polarized antenna
with high gain and low axial ratio. Recently, various types
of planar antennas have been proposed for DBS reception at
this frequency range. The planar antenna is made of an array
of antenna elements, each antenna element being capable of
receiving 12 GHz signals. Since these antenna elements
constituting the array must be able to receive signals of a
short wavelength, e.g., in the neighborhood of 2.5 cm, they
must be small in size and a large array of elements is
required in order to provide sufficient energy for
satisfactory television pictures. Two of such planar antennas are disclosed in U.S. Patents
4,680,591 and 4,907, 012, each comprising an array of helical
antenna elements with probes located with in a common resonant
cavity of square cross section. The cavity is used to combine
all the outputs from the elements with a low loss.
Specifically, in U.S. patent 4,907,012, four inwardly-protruding
buttresses are provided in the antenna, wherein
each buttress is positioned mid-way along a side of the cavity
to promote the formation of standing waves of a different mode
thereby to improve the frequency range characteristics of the
array.Since, however, these antennas employ resonant cavity to
combine the outputs from the antenna elements by forming
standing waves, the antenna elements must be arranged
precisely, which will in turn reduce the production
tolerability.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
provide an improved planar antenna capable of providing higher
aperture efficiency, improved polarization and increased
production tolerability through the use of an array of helical
antenna elements and a strip line feeder pattern coupled
thereto.In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided a planar antenna for the reception of Direct
Broadcast Satellite television signals, comprising: an array
of M x N helical antenna elements, each helical antenna
element including a helical antenna and a straight stem end
portion attached thereto, wherein M and N are integers; a
first dielectric layer having a top and a bottom surface and
provided with an array of M x N through holes,
