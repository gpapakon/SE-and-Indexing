 DIRECTED HUMAN IMMUNE GLOBULIN FOR THE PREVENTION> AND TREATMENT OF STAPHYLOCOCCAL INFECTIONSI. GOVERNMENT INTEREST The invention described herein may be manufactured, licensed and used by or for govermental purposes without the payment of any royalties to us thereon.II. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to Directed Human Immune Globulin for the prevention and treatment of staphylococcal infections.Ï€i. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Over the last two decades, staphylococci have become importantcauses of infection in hospitalized patients. Because of their high prevalence on the skin, staphylococci are ideally situated to cause serious infections in debilitated or immunosuppressed patients. The staphylococcal species most frequently pathogenic in humans are Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE). Both groups have developed resistance tomultiple antibiotics making antimicrobial therapy difficult. In recent years SEhas become a major cause of nosocomial infection in patients whose treatments include the placement of foreign materials such as cerebrospinal fluid shunts, 

vascular catheters or joint prostheses. SE is a common cause of post operative wound infections peritonitis in patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Patients with impaired immunity (malignancy, bone marrow transplant) or those receiving parenteral nutrition through central venous catheter are also at high risk for developing SE sepsis (Patrick, J. Pediat., 1990). SE has emerged as a common cause of neonatal nosocomial sepsis in premature infants. As shown by Fleer and colleagues, (Pediatr Infect Dis, 1983) SE infections frequently occur in immature babies that have received parenteral nutrition. Premature babies have impaired immunity with deficiencies in antibodies, complement and neutrophil function. Lipid infusion is now a standard ingredient of parenteral nutrition therapy in many nurseries and may further impair immunity to bacterial infection as disclosed by Fischer and colleagues (Lancet, 1980; 2:819-20). Recent studies have associatedcoagulase negative staphylococcal bacteria in neonates with lipid emulsioninfiision (Freeman and colleagues, N. Engl. J. Med, 1990). Further studies by Fleer and colleagues (J Inf Dis, 1985) showed that neonates had low levels of opsonic antibody to SE despite the fact that the sera had clearly detectable levels of IgG antibodies to SE peptidoglycan (opsonic antibodies for staphylococcus have been considered to be directed to the peptidoglycan

<CLAIMS>
We claim:
1. A Directed Human Immune Globulin for the prevention or treatment of Staphylococcus epidermidis infections.
2. A Directed Human Immune Globulin of Claim 1 which
contains a measured level of anti-staphylococcal IgG antibodies that react with surface antigens of Staphylococcus epidermidis and promote phagocytosis and killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis in vitro and/or protection against Staphylococcus epidermidis in vivo.
3. The Directed Human Immune Globulin of Claim 2 wherein the measured level of anti-staphylococcal IgG antibodies has an opsonic activity within the range of about 80 to about 100 percent.
4. A pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of Directed Human Immune Globulin of Claim 1 sufficient to prevent or treat infections by S
t
 epidermidil and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.
5. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a Directed Human
Immune Globulin of Claim 2. 


 6. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a Directed Human Immune Globulin of Claim 3.
7. A method of preparing a Directed Human Immune Globulin of Claim 1 by screening serum, plasma, or an immunoglobulin pool by Si epidermidis ELISA or Opsonic Assays.
8. The method of Claim 7 wherein serum is screened by S
t
epidermidis ELISA or Opsonic Assays.
9. The method of Claim 8 wherein the serum is screened by S
t
 epidermidis ELISA.
10. The method of Claim 8 wherein the serum is screened by S
t
 epidermidis Opsonic Assays.
11. The method of Claim 7 wherein the plasma is screened by S
t
 epidermidis ELISA or Opsonic Assays.
12. The method of Claim 11 wherein the plasma is screened by S
t
 epidermidis ELISA. 


 13. The method of Claim 11 wherein the plasma is screened by i epidermidis Opsonic Assays.
14. The method of Claim 7 herein the immunoglobulin pool is
screened by S epidermidis ELISA or Opsonic Assays.
15. The method of Claim 14 wherein the immunoglobulin pool is screened by S
t
 epidermidis ELISA.
16. The method of Claim 14 wherein the immunoglobulin pool
is screened by 
t
 epidermidis Opsonic Assays.
17. A method of preparing a Directed Human Immune Globulin of Claim 1 comprising the steps of: (a) immunizing plasma donors and (b) removing plasma from said donors for Directed Immune Globulin preparation.
18. A method of assessing the protective level of Direct Human Immune Globulin by using an immature or intralipid induced lethal model to provide minimum protective standard comprising the steps of: (a) screening with in vitro assays and (b) using animal lethality tests to ensure that the immunoglobulin preparation provided protective antibody to S epidermidis. 


 19. A method of treating a host with a therapeutically- effective amount of S
t
 epidermidis of Directed Human Immune Globulin of Claim 1 by intraveneous administration thereof.
20. A method of treating a host with a therapeutically effective amount of S
t
 epidermidis of Directed Human Immune Globulin of Claim 1 by intramuscular administration thereof.
21. The method of Claim 19 wherein the host is treated prior to infection with S
^
 epidermidis.
22. The method of Claim 20 wherein the host is treated after infection with S
t
 epidermidis.
