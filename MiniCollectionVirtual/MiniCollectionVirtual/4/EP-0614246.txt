<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an array antenna (1) 
comprising a number of antenna elements (3.1-3.8, 4.1-4.8). 

The antenna elements are divided up into a first 
group of at least two antenna elements (3.1, 3.3, 3.5, 

3.7, 4.1, 4.3, 4.5, 4.7), having a first main lobe 
direction, and a second group of at least two antenna 

elements (3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.8, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8), having 
a second main lobe direction. In order to produce a 

number of fixed antenna patterns of an attractive type, 
between which the array antenna can be switched, the 

array antenna is provided, according to the invention, 
with a switchable phase network (37) and a specific feed 

network (21, 22). The feed network is divided up, between 
the feedpoint (20) and the antenna elements, into a first 

branching network (21) for feeding the said first group 
of antenna elements, and a second branching network (22) 

for feeding the said second group of antenna elements. 
The first branching network is arranged to initiate 

essentially the same phase shift between the feedpoint 
and the respective antenna elements within the first 

group. The second branching network is arranged to 
initiate essentially the same phase shift between the 

feedpoint and the respective antenna elements within the 
second group. The array antenna is suitable, for example, 

as a base station antenna in a mobile telephone system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna array comprising a plurality of
antenna elements divided up into two groups, a first group of at least two antenna
elements, having a first main lobe direction, and a second group of at least two
antenna elements, having a second main lobe direction distinct from the first
main lobe direction, the antenna being made up of at least one row of antenna
elements, the individual antenna elements of the first group in a row being
separated by an individual antenna element of the second group, feed network for
feeding the antenna elements, and means for mutual shifting of the phase position
between the first group of antenna elements and the second group of antenna
elements.An array antenna according to the above is already known from SE B 455907.
Associated with each pair formed by an antenna element from each group of
antenna elements are two hybrid circuits and two phase shifters. By means of
controlling the incorporated phase shifters, it is possible to produce a scanning
lobe which sweeps across a large angle range. The antenna provides a possibility
of high drive level in a sideways direction. Since each pair of antenna elements
requires two hybrid circuits and two phase shifters, the antenna is relatively
complex in terms of components and is therefore expensive. The antenna is
suitable for advanced applications which require a scanning lobe and in which
the costs of the antenna is not an important determining factor.Another antenna is known from EP-A-0 512 487. A conformed antenna intended
for space communication is disclosed provided with radiating elements which
line-wise are connected to the same phase shifter. The lines or generatrices are
distributed on the surface of the conformed antenna to cover a whole revolution. The object of the present invention is to produce an array antenna affording the
possibility of high drive level, which is simple and robust in its construction ,
suitable for mass production and available at a reasonable price.The object of the invention is achieved by means of an array antenna which is
characterized by the fact that the means for mutual phase shifting comprise a
phase network switchable between discrete positions connecting different of a
plurality of alternative antenna signal routes of different phase shift between
input and output of the means for mutual phase shifting to introduce different
phase shifting, and in that the feed network between feedpoint and antenna
elements is divided up into a first branching network
