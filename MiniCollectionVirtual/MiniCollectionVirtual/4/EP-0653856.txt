<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for evaluating the quality of a communications network installed on a motor vehicle, including several electronic modules linked by a communications bus and each sending signals in the form of frames, characterised in that it consists in:   - measuring the transition times  delta Tm  between the low (0) and high (1) binary states on the one hand, and  delta Td between the high (1) and low (0) binary states on the other hand, over each frame of the signal flowing on the bus, for a constant voltage difference delta V=V2-V1, which is representative of this transition between the binary states and is fixed by the characteristics of the bus, the said measurement being performed over one or more specific bits situated outside of the arbitration region of the frame, which moreover is identified; - searching for the maximum transition time, and comparing it with a predefined maximum value  delta TMAX for a given configuration of the vehicle.
