<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photoelectric
conversion device to be used in image sensors employed e.g.
in copying machines, facsimile machines, video cameras
and video recorders, optical sensors represented by AE Auto Exposure
sensors and AF (Auto Focus) sensors of cameras and sensors for
detecting positions of objects, more specifically, a
photoelectric conversion device suited to detect a
light such as a micro spot light.Figs. 1A to 1C respectively show an example of a
known photoelectric conversion device (sensor)
and Fig. 1A shows a 2-dimensional sensor which has 16
sensor cells, as photoelectric conversion elements, in
total, including four sensor cells per line and four
sensor cells per row.In this sensor, each of the lines is selected in
sequence from the above in the drawing by a vertical
shift register VSR and four discrete signals are
outputted by the horizontal shift register HSR in time
series sequence to the output terminal OUT.Signals of these sensor cells are output in
sequence in combinations of line scanning and row
scanning. In an actual sensor, the number of sensor cells
amounts to 100 to 100,000 and therefore the effect of
reducing the read time and the scan time from one cell
is obviously limited.On the other hand, those signals from the sensor
cells are visible image signals in most cases. In the
case of such visible image, bright signals may be
concentrated only at an extremely small area in one
frame as the flame of a match in darkness and the
remaining area may be occupied by dark signals.Even in such case, the signals of all cells of the
known sensor have been outputted in time series
sequence and accumulated in an external random access
memory, then required image signal processing has been
carried out.On the other hand, in case of the AE sensor (photo
sensor for automatic exposure control), the size of the
cell is expanded to reduce the number of separate parts
and a configuration for ensuring short scanning time is
used.Fig. 1B shows a sensor as described above and each
cell (SS11 ... SS22) has a larger light receiving area
than the cell shown in Fig. 1A and the number of
divisions is 4.The sensor shown in Fig. 1B, however, cannot
discriminate uniform irradiation of weak light onto the
whole light receiving surface of the cell (ma 1 in Fig. 1C) from 
irradiation of strong light only at a part of the light
receiving surface of the cell (ma 2 in Fig. 1C) and therefore it
is difficult to apply this sensor to detection of a
spot of light on a small area.As described above,
