<ABSTRACT>
The nozzle plate (12) contains nozzles (13), fluid chambers (16) and connecting channels (22) between the fluid chambers (16) and the supply container for the fluid. All the functional areas are produced integrally as microstructure bodies by moulding one or more microstructured mould inserts. The distance which can be implemented between the nozzles (13) is small in order to allow an increased printing density. The nozzle plate (12) is provided for fluid jet print heads (one or more colours).
