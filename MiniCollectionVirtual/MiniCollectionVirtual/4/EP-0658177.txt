<DESCRIPTION>
 GLOSSY AND TRANSPARENT INK-PRINTABLE POLYOLEFINIC FILM COMPOSITIONBackground of the Invention This invention relates to polyolefinic polymer compositions having improved ■ proDerties In particular, this invention relates to improving the receptivity or adhesion of printing inks to the surface of shaped articles made from such polyolefinic polymer compositionsPolyolefinic polymers, in particular ethylene polymers such as polyethylene are used for forming shaped articles such as sheets, films, tubes, bottles, containers, etc therefrom However, polyethylene has, and consequently articles made thereof have, an extremely smooth hydrophobic surface which is unreceptive to most common types of printing inks and dyes and thus it is difficult to print the surface of polyethylene articles.Various known methods have been used to make ethylene polymers more receptive to printing inks. For example, there are a number of surface treating tecnniques which have been developed to improve the receptivity of the polymer surface to printing inks including chemical treatment with oxidizing agents such as chlorine and strong acids and electronic, or corona discharge treatment of the polymer surface. Flame treatment of the surface of polyethylene has also been used to make the polyethylene more receptive to printing inks.Another method used to improve the receptivity of the polymer surface to printing inks is to apply a coating or printable top layer on the surface of the polymer layer to be printed. For example, multilayer films have been disclosed in the prior art wherein the top printable layer or printable skin layer of the film is described as being made from materials such as ethylene acrylic acid, ethylene methyl acrylic acid, ethylene ethyl acryiate, ethylene methyl acryiate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, nylon, polybutyiene, polystyrene, polyurethane, poiysulfone, polyvinylidene chloride, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polymethyl pentene, styrene maleic anhydride, styrene acrylonitrile, ionomers based on sodium or zinc salts of ethylene/methacrylic acid, acrylics, cellulosics, fluoroplastics, nitriles and thermoplastic polyesters.Still another method used to improve the receptivity of a polymer surface to printing inks is to form a novel polymeric composition which has as one of its improved properties an enhanced receptivity to printing ink. Thus, articles, such as a monolayer film, made from said composition would have the improved property of enhanced receptivity to printing ink. For example, it is known to
