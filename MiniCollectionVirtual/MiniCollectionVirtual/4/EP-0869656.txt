<ABSTRACT>
A system wherein already-existing computing and memory
resources in an electronic camera are used to process an image for printing.

Rather than duplicating, in printers, computing and memory resources that are
already in digital cameras, significant computing and memory resources need exist

only in the camera. A digital camera can support many different printers, each
with its own set of parameters such as for example print size, pixel size,

colorimetry, sensitometry, and artifacts compensation. Printer parameters are
uploaded from the printer to the camera to provide a basis for image processing

specific to the associated printer; whereby compensation may be done for
variations in the printer characteristics which may occur as a result of printer

manufacturing variations, and further so that compensation may be done for
different media types which may be installed in the printer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital cameras and associated
printers for producing hardcopy images captured by such cameras.Typically, images captured by digital cameras must be processed
before they are printed. This processing is carried out in the printer. Significant
computing and memory resources are required to process an image for printing.
Accordingly, the printer must be provided with expensive computing and memory
resources. One solution known in the prior art is to provide access to a stand-alone
computer that is connectable to both the camera and the printer, either
directly or by portable memory. This solution is inappropriate when the printer is
to be used in remote locations distanced from the computer.There is described in WO 95/16323 a digital camera that has
incorporated therein a printer for producing a hard copy print on a paper sheet. A
single microcontroller is used to control both the image capture and the print
functions. The microcontroller accesses image data in memory through the image
sensor interface and a multiplexed address/data bus. The microcontroller retrieves
data from memory and applies contrast enhancment, magnification, dithering and
data compression algorithms to prepare the data for printing. The microcontroller
applies user selected special effects to print-formatted data as it is retrieved from
memory for printing. The effects that can be selected include bnary image, outline
image, contrast enhancement and the addition of a speech bubble.According to a feature of the present invention which is defined in claims 1 and 3, I have come to
appreciate that computing and memory resources, which already exist in electronic
cameras in order for the camera to capture, process, compress, and store images,
can be used to provide the computing and memory resources that are required to
process an image for printing. It is an object of the present invention to provide a system wherein
already-existing computing and memory resources in an electronic camera are
used to process an image for printing. This is possible because the existing
computing and memory resources are otherwise generally idle during the printing
stage. Accordingly, it is a feature of the present invention that, rather than
duplicating, in printers, computing and memory resources that are already in
digital cameras, the present invention provides for camera and printer systems
wherein significant computing and memory resources need exist only in the
camera. Because such resources are already required by
