<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is an acrylic rubber-based composition suitable for 
hot-air vulcanization under normal pressure in a continuous process. 

The rubber composition comprises, besides an acrylic rubber 
polymer having, in a molecule, at least two silicon-bonded vinyl 

groups to serve as the crosslinking sites, reinforcing filler and organic 
peroxide as a vulcanizing agent, an alkoxy silane compound 

having a vinyl group or (meth)acryloxy group bonded to the silicon 
atom, such as vinyl triethoxy silane and 3-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy 

silane in a specified amount. This unique ingredient 
serves as a vulcanization accelerator so that the vulcanization reaction 

is so rapid as to be freed from foaming of the vulcanizate due 
to the volatile matters and is complete even in the surface layer 

without the vulcanization-inhibiting influences by the atmospheric 
oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an acrylic rubber-based
composition or, more particularly, to an acrylic rubber-based composition
suitable for hot-air vulcanization under normal pressure
in a continuous molding and vulcanizing process with a greatly
improved productivity as compared with conventional acrylic rubber-based
compositions which can be molded and vulcanized only
under compression in a batch-wise process.As is well known, acrylic rubbers are widely used as a principal
material of rubber parts in automobiles since these rubbers
have outstandingly excellent high heat resistance and oil resistance
among various synthetic rubbers. It is known that the velocity
of vulcanization of acrylic rubbers in vulcanization largely depends
on the types of the functional groups in the rubber molecules
to pertain to the vulcanization reaction. For example, the vulcanizing
velocity of an acrylic rubber having active halogen atoms as
the vulcanization sites is large as compared with acrylic rubbers
functional with epoxy groups. While the vulcanizing velocity of an
acrylic rubber should desirably be as high as possible since a rubber
composition contains some vaporizable ingredients and the
vulcanization reaction usually produces a volatile matter as a decomposition
product which unavoidably causes foaming or surface
blistering of the shaped and vulcanized rubber article unless the 
vulcanization is undertaken under compression, the vulcanizing
velocity of the active halogen-functional acrylic rubber composition
is still not high enough so that such an acrylic rubber composition
is not suitable for the so-called hot-air vulcanization under
normal pressure in order to obtain shaped and vulcanized rubber
articles free from foaming and blistering, which can be obtained
only by the vulcanization under compression.Japanese Patent Publications No. 2-1859 and No. 4-30963
propose a rapid vulcanization-type acrylic rubber composition by
introducing organosilicon groups having a silicon-bonded vinyl
group into the acrylic rubber molecules. A substantial improvement
can be obtained by this means relating to the vulcanizing velocity
but the improvement obtained thereby is far from satisfactory
because microscopic bubbles are always found in the vulcanizate
obtained by the hot-air vulcanization under normal pressure.
Moreover, the acrylic rubber composition of this type has another
problem that the vulcanization reaction thereof is subject to inhibition
by the atmospheric oxygen so that the vulcanization in the
surface layer
