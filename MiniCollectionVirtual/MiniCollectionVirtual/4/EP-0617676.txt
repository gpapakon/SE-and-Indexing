<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automotive seat 
recliners and, more particularly, to a double enveloping worm 
and gear seat reclining mechanism to permit the controlled 
manual or motor driven reclining of an automotive seat back. Automotive seats usually include a seat bottom that 
is affixed to a seat frame. The seat frame is mounted to the 
floor of the vehicle via a rail-type adjustment system to 
allow the forward and rearward adjustment of the seat bottom. 
The seat back is attached to the seat frame by a seat back 
support. If the seat is a reclining-type seat where the seat 
back is rotationally movable with respect to the seat bottom, 
a locking and release mechanism is usually provided. The seat 
reclining mechanism usually includes a base that is affixed 
to the structure of the seat frame. The seat back support is 
pivotally mounted to such base as it is desirable to have the 
seat back move forward and rearward with the seat bottom. The 
locking and release mechanism by which the seat back is held 
in a fixed angular position relative to the seat bottom has 
several known forms. One form is a ratchet mechanism where 
a notched wheel is affixed to either the seat back or seat 
bottom and a pawl is attached to the other. Upon the pawl 
disengaging the notched wheel, the seat back is released and 
is free to rotate at its pivot with respect to the seat 
bottom. Other types of engaging or intermeshing gear-type 
mechanisms provide a locking and a releasing operation between 
the seat bottom and seat back. In manual reclining seat back adjustments, the 
reclining seat backs may be physically adjusted by the 
occupant of the seat by releasing a latching or locking 
mechanism and simply leaning back to displace the seat back 
to a desired position, at which time the latch or lock is re-engaged. 
Usually biasing spring means are provided, effective  
 
to adjust the seat back forwardly when unlocked and such 
movement is unopposed by the occupant. A reclining seat back which is power operated is 
adjustable both forwardly and rearwardly. The power source 
typically is a reversible electric motor, which drives the 
seat back through a train of gears contained in a transmission 
housing fixed to a seat mount or bracket. In many cases, the 
gear train can require a large transmission housing, and may 
also require that a complementary gear train be positioned on 
an opposite side of the seat back with an interconnecting 
drive mechanism between the two gear trains, the extra weight 
of this dual
