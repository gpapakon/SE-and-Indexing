<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a container for articles, which 
container is known generally as a'basket-type' container. Basket type containers are well known and generally 
comprise an open topped basket portion in which articles such as 
bottles sit. There is also provided a handle portion for carrying the 
container complete with articles. It is very common for the articles 
to be beverage bottles containing beer for example. The basket type 
container constitutes a convenient method of carrying a number of 
bottles. Commonly the container containers 6 bottles in two rows of 
three but other configurations are used such as 2 x 2, 1 x 3, 2 x 4, etc. One significant drawback with known basket type 
containers is that customers can take single bottles from the 
container. This causes difficulties when the pricing system prices the 
whole arrangement of articles rather than individual bottles. Also of 
course it is easy to steal individual bottles from a retail outlet. In 
addition careless transporting can result in the articles falling out of 
the container if say the container is inadvertently tipped onto its side 
or upside down. In DE-A-2700158 there is disclosed a basket type paperboard 
container for a plurality of articles, the container comprising a 
handle portion, a basket portion having a bottom wall, two oppositely 
disposed side walls and two oppositely disposed end walls, and 
retaining means for retaining the articles in the basket portion, said 
retaining means having one or more areas in which openings are 
provided, said areas having an initial, article retaining position 
whereby each opening receives the top of an article and said areas 
having an opened position whereby the area or areas have been 
removed or partially removed to allow removal of the articles, 
the handle portion and basket portion remaining substantially intact 
after said removal or partial removal of said one or more areas . In DE-A-2757095 there is disclosed a similar container having 
flaps which project into the openings so as to engage and support the 
necks of the bottles therein.  
 According to a first aspect of the present invention the parts 
of the retaining means at the lengthwise ends wide of the end 
openings are reinforced, said reinforced parts being disposed outside 
of said one or more areas. Preferably said retaining means comprises portions which 
extend generally from each side wall towards the handle portion. 
Ideally said portions are extensions of said side walls and co-operate 
to constitute
