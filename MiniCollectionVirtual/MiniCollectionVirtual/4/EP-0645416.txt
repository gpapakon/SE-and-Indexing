<ABSTRACT>
A fiber sheet impregnated with a resin composition mainly comprising poly-p-phenylene sulfide and having 
the degree of orientation of 0.3 to 0.9. The sheet is markedly improved in thermal resistance, thermal dimensional 

stability, dielectric characteristics and mechanical properties when folded, thus being suited for use as insulation 

base material for circuit boards and multilayer interconnection boards wherein higher-density and thinner circuits are 
necessitated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin-impregnated
fabric sheet comprising a fabric sheet in which poly-p-phenylene
sulfide resin is impregnated. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a resin-impregnated
fabric sheet having excellent heat
resistance, thermal dimensional stability, high frequency
characteristics, mechanical properties and the like,
which is suited for circuit boards having small
thickness.In the fields of electricity and electronics, to
attain compaction and high performance of devices, a
circuit board having characteristics well balanced at a
high level, such as heat resistance, thermal dimensional
stability, mechanical properties, low hygroscopicity,
fire retardance, high frequency characteristics and the
like, is demanded. It is further demanded for the
circuit board to attain processing of signals at a high
speed and to have small thickness. Therefore, the
insulation substrate used for the circuit board also has
to satisfy the above-mentioned demands.Conventional insulation substrates used in this
field include substrates comprising a glass cloth in
which an epoxy resin is impregnated (hereinafter also 
referred to as "epoxy resin-impregnated substrate"),
polyimide films, fluorine-contained films and the like.
However, the epoxy resin-impregnated substrates have high
hygroscopicity and poor high frequency characteristics,
and it is difficult to make the thickness thereof small.
Although polyimide films have good heat resistances, they
have high hygroscopicities and poor high frequency
characteristics. Fluorine-contained films have poor
adhesivenesses, so that it is not easy to mount electro-conductive
pastes or to be plated when forming through
holes.To employ a non-oriented sheet of poly-p-phenylene
sulfide (poly-p-phenylene sulfide is hereinafter also
referred to as "PPS", and non-oriented sheet of poly-p-phenylene
sulfide sheet is hereinafter also referred to
as "PPS sheet") as the insulation substrate of a circuit
board is disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application (Kokai) No. 56-34426, and to employ a
biaxially oriented film of PPS (hereinafter also referred
to as "PPS film") as the insulation substrate of a
circuit board is disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application (Kokai) No. 55-36945. These techniques are
highly drawing attention recently.However, although PPS sheets when used alone have
satisfactory thermal dimensional stabilities, low
hygroscopicities, fire retardances, high frequency
characteristics and the like, the temperature to which
