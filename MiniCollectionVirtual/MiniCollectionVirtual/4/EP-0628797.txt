A cold-accumulator cartridge comprising a housing (1,2) having an
interior into which a cold-accumulator medium (4) is introduced and the housing (1) having a

device for indicating the charging state of the cold-accumulator medium, characterized in that
the indicator device comprises an indicator substance (13) of a entectic aqueous mixture of a

salt, whose melting and crystallization temperature Ti is lower than the melting temperature
Ts of the cold-accumulator medium (4), in that the indicator substance (13) is held in a

container (10) which is in heat-conducting contact with the cold-accumulator medium (4), in
that the container (10) comprises an optically transparent wall portion (8) and in that the

indicator device is connected to the cold-accumulator cartridge in such a manner that the
transparent wall portion (8) is visible from outside the cold-accumulator cartridge.
A cold-accumulator cartridge as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that
conspicuously coloured solid bodies (11) are introduced into the container (10) whose

specific weight differs from that of the liquefied indicator substance (13).
A cold-accumulator cartridge as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the melting temperature Ti of the indicator substance (13) is preferably 1 to 5 K lower

than the melting temperature Ts of the cold-accumulator medium (4).
A cold-accumulator cartridge as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the container (10) of the indicator device projects into the area of the

cold-accumulator medium (4) which is the last to crystallize during the cold-accumulating
process.
A cold-accumulator cartridge as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the indicator substance (13) is a eutectic aqueous mixture of an

inorganic salt.
A cold-accumulator cartridge as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that
the cold-accumulator medium (4) is a mixture of potassium chloride, glycerine and water

having a melting point of approximately -12Â° C, and in that the indicator substance (13) is a
solution of 36.8% potassium hydrogenphosphate (K
2
HPO
4
) in water.
A cold-accumulator cartridge as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the container (10) is made from a synthetic resin which is elastically

expandable at the operating temperature.
A cold-accumulator cartridge as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that a protective housing (9) accommodates the container (10) so as to be in

heat-conducting contact therewith, and in that said protective housing (9) projects into the
cold-accumulator medium (4) 
via
 an aperture in the bottom of the cold-accumulator cartridge.
A cold-accumulator cartridge as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that an aperture which is formed in a wall (1,2) of the housing and into

which the indicator device is introduced is a filling hole for the cold-accumulator medium.
