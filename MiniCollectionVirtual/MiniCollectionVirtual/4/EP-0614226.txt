<DESCRIPTION>
In fully-depleted Silicon-on-Insulator Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon Field 
Effect Transistors (SOI/MOSFETs) it is vary difficult to achieve symmetric threshold 
voltages far the n-channel and p-channel transistors with the conventional polysilicon 
gate. Restated, in order to ensure proper CMOS operation, it is desirable for 
the threshold voltages of the n-channel and p-channel devices to have the same 
absolute value. Such is difficult to achieve with conventional polysilicon gates. 
Further, it is difficult to achieve proper threshold voltages suitable for both n and p 
channel devices. The invention provides proper and symmetric threshold voltages suitable for CMOS 
logic applications, for n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs through the use of a gate 
electrode structure in which a thin TiN layer is sandwiched in between the gate oxide 
of the MOSFET and the polysilicon gate portion of the MOSFET. Figure 1 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a first preferred embodiment of 
the invention. Figure 2 illustrates a cross-sectional drawing of a second preferred embodiment 
of the invention. Figure 3 illustrates a schematic drawing of p and n type MOSFET SOI devices 
having a common gate connector. Figure 4 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a third preferred embodiment of 
the invention using a poly Si-Ge material in place of TiN.  Figure 1 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a first preferred embodiment of 
the invention. As shown, a titanium nitride, TiN, is sandwiched in between a 
polysilicon gate portion (Poly-Si) and gate oxide 2 overlying lightly doped p-type (p-) 
silicon film 3 which overlies insulator 5. Source region 4 is shown as a highly doped 
n-type material (n+). Likewise, drain region 8 is shown as a highly doped n-type 
material (n+). Lightly doped drain regions (LDD) 6 extend from both the source and 
drain regions and are shown as lightly doped n-type material (n-). LDD spacers abut 
the poly silicon gate portion. The process for forming the structure of figure 1 is as 
follows: 
1) Grow an oxide layer over silicon film 3. 2) Deposit TiN over the oxide layer (optimally less than 1000 Å) either by 
chemical vapor deposition or by plasma sputtering. 3) Deposit a polysilicon layer over said gate oxide (optimally approximately 
3500 to 4500 Å). 4) Etch the polysilicon so as to form the gate portion shown (optimally by 
conventional dry etch). 5) Etch the TiN using the polysilicon gate portion as a mask (optimally by 
conventional dry etch) to form a TiN portion of the device gate.
