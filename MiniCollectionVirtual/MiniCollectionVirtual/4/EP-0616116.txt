<ABSTRACT>
An induction system and control method for an internal combustion 
engine that will improve running under low speed, low load conditions by 

increasing turbulence in the combustion chamber through the use of a 
control valve (61) positioned in the induction system (38) for the 

engine. Under high speed, high load conditions, the control valve is 
held in an open position and thus, t
he engine is capable of obtaining 
high output since there is no restriction to the intake air flow. In 

addition, transient conditions of the engine, such as variations in idle 
speed, variations in the amount of EGR, changes in speed, such as 

acceleration or deceleration, starting and warmup, are compensated for 
by positioning the throttle control valve to obtain optimum performance, 

and in some instances, the amount of fuel supplied to the engine is also 
varied so as to improve exhaust emission control and reduce fuel 

consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an induction system for an
internal combustion engine and to a method of operating an
engine and more particularly to an induction system and
method of operating an engine to improve performance under
certain types of transient conditions. As is well known, the
induction system for an internal combustion engine is
particularly important in determining the performance of the
engine. Induction systems in conventional engines generally
represent a compromise between the free-breathing type of
induction systems that provide high performance by
introducing the charge into the combustion chamber in an
unrestricted fashion and without introducing turbulence to
the inducted air charge and the low speed or mid-range type
of induction system that provides a higher flow velocity and
turbulence in the combustion chamber. The free breathing
system, although it permits maximum charging and high
performance, will provide less than desirable performance
under low speed, low load conditions. An induction system
that provides good performance under low load conditions,
however, will not offer the ability to induct sufficient air
so as to achieve maximum performance. Therefore, it has been
the practice with conventional engines to compromise the
induction system between these two extremes.There have also been provided induction systems that
include devices for introducing turbulence and/or high
velocity to the intake charge under some running conditions
and substantially unrestricted induction under high speed
high load conditions. One such system is described in the
co-pending application of Yoshiharo Isaka entitled "Tumble
Control Valve for Intake Port," Serial No. 07/834,604, filed
February 12, 1992, and assigned to the assignee hereof. This
system, shows a number of embodiments of induction systems
wherein there is provided a control valve in the intake 
passage which is moveable between a first, opened position in
which unrestricted charging is provided and wherein the
charge flows into the combustion chamber in a generally axial
direction for high speed running. Under low speed or mid-range
performance, the control valve is moved to another
position wherein the charge which enters the combustion
chamber is redirected so as to increase the turbulence in the
combustion chamber and also the velocity at which the charge
is inducted. The turbulence is generated by introducing
either a tumble and/or a swirl to the intake charge. Tumble
is generally referred to as a type of swirl that occurs
