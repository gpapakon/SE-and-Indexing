<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for securing a windshield wiper shaft (6) in its bearing housing (5), as well as a windshield wiper. The shaft (6) is secured in its bearing (5) by filling out the ring gap (9) between the shaft and the bearing with injected plastic material (8). Optimum sealing and bearing properties are thus achieved.

<CLAIMS>
A method of fixating a shaft (6) in its bearing casing 5) 
in wiper installations, in particular for cleaning the 

windscreen of an automotive vehicle, the shaft (6) 
including an annular gap (9) between the shaft (6) and the 

bearing casing (5),
characterized
 in that, after inserting and, 
if required, aligning the shaft (6) in its bearing casing 

(5), plastified plastic material (8) or metal is injected 
at least in sections of the annular gap (9). 
A method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the shaft (6) is heated 
before injection, in particular up to a temperature of 200°C 

± 30°C. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized
 in that the plastic material 
(8) or the metal, respectively, is injected axially and/or 

radially into the annular gap (9). 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that different plastic 
materials (8) or metals are injected into the annular gap 

(9) simultaneously or in succession. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that, during injection, the 
annular gap (9) is closed axially, for example, by means of 

a tool.  
 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the plastic material 
(8) or the metal is at least partially injection-moulded 

around the axial end of the bearing casing (5). 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the plastic material or 
the metal is injected into recesses (10,11,12,22,24,26) 

provided on the inside (5) and/or the circumferential 
surface of the shaft (6). 
A wiper installation, manufactured according to a method of 
the preceding claims and used, in particular, for cleaning 

the windscreen of an automotive vehicle, including a drive 
mechanism (1) and a linkage coupled to the drive mechanism 

(1), wherein the drive mechanism (1) and/or the linkage 
have at least one rotating or swinging shaft (6) supported 

in a casing (5), and including an annular gap (9) between 
the shaft (6) and its casing (5),
characterized
 in that plastic material or 
metal (8) is injected at least in sections of the annular 

gap (9) between the shaft (6) and its casing (5). 
A wiper installation as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that the plastic material 
(8) and the metal is provided with the addition of a 

lubricant. 
A wiper installation as claimed in claim 8 or claim 9,
characterized
 in that the plastic material 
(8) is a thermoplastic material and a duroplastic material.  

 
A wiper installation as claimed in claim 8 or claim 9,
characterized
 in that the annular gap (9) is 
filled by the injection of a copper, lead and/or tin alloy. 
A wiper installation as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 
11,
characterized
 in that in cured or permanently 
hardened condition, the injected plastic material (8) or 

metal forms a bearing and a seal for the shaft (6). 
A wiper installation as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 
12,
characterized
 in that the shaft (6) and/or 
the inside of the bearing casing (5) includes steps, 

recesses (10,11,12,22,24,26), shoulders, etc., which are 
filled by the injection of plastic material (8) or metal. 
A wiper installation as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 
13,
characterized
 in that the plastic material 
(8) and the metal rises axially and, in particular, 

radially above the bearing casing (5). 
A wiper installation as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 
14,
characterized
 in that the plastic material 
(8) and the metal on the shaft (6) tapers at its axial 

ends.  
 
A wiper installation as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 
15,
characterized
 in that additional seals, such 
as O-rings (20) or the like, are integrated in the plastic 

material (8) or in the metal. 
A wiper installation as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 
16,
characterized
 in that the bearing casing (5) 
on its axial ends has a circumferential axial groove (19). 
A wiper installation as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 
17,
characterized
 in that the bearing casing (5) 
has a radial feed opening (18). 
A wiper installation as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 
18,
characterized
 in that the shaft (6) is a 
driven shaft of a wiper motor, the shaft of a wiper 

bearing, or the like.
