<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a noise reduction method, in 
particular for speech recognition, and to a filter designed to 
implement this method. Over the years a lot of contributions for the solution to the 
problem of noise reduction for speech signals have been making; 
one of the possible approaches is the so-called "noise 
suppression": the noise spectrum is estimated during speech 
pauses and such estimates are used during speech periods 
following the pauses to reduce the noise content of the speech 
signal. Such problem becomes still more serious in high-noisy environment 
like, e.g., the inside of a car; a recent proposal on this matter 
is contained in the article by J. Yang, titled "Frequency Domain 
Noise Suppression Approaches in Mobile Telephone Systems", 
published in Proc. ICASSP, vol. 2, pp. 363-366, April 1993. Such article is a further processing of the technique proposed by 
R.J. McAulay, M.L. Malpass in "Speech Enhancement Using a Soft-Decision 
Noise Suppression Filter", IEEE Transactions on ASSP, 
vol. 28, No. 2, pp 137-145, April 1980. In such article a special suppression algorithm is used for 
prefiltering the speech signal in such a way as to hold in 
account not only the minimum distortion of the voice but also 
subjective criteria for the naturalness of the noise. The main task of the present invention is to make a further  
 
contribution for the solution to the problem of noise reduction, 
in particular for automatic speech recognition applications. In view of this task, a first object is to improve the above-mentioned 
method adapting it to the automatic speech recognition 
requirements; a second object is to hold the memory effect in 
account, which is linked to the suppression technique itself; a 
further object is to limit the computational complexity of the 
algorithm. The task, as well as the aforesaid and other objects will be 
reached through the noise reduction method and filter as set 
forth in claims 1 and 8 respectively; further advantageous 
aspects of the present invention are set forth in the subclaims. With the present method, the estimate of the spectral envelope of 
the speech signal amplitude, is calculated according to the 
formula :

E{A|X,O;H1} * p(H1|X,O) + E{A|X,O;H0} * p(H0|X,O). The invention will now be described in more detail. As already said, with the noise reduction method, in particular 
for speech recognition, according to the present invention, the 
estimate of the spectral envelope of the speech signal amplitude 
in a predetermined
