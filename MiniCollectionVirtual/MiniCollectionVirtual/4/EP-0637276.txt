<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pressure device for timber cutting machines with a longitudinally adjustable arm (32) pivoting about a horizontal axis (22) and fitted on a pillow block (20). The arm bears a vertically and horizontally adjustable pressure shoe (38) acting on the top of the workpiece (18) and a vertically adjustable guide (34) pivotable about a vertical axis and pressing the workpiece (18) against a stop (16). According to the invention, there is a clamping ring (50) screwed on a male thread (42) to lock the longitudinally adjusted arm (32) and/or the vertically and horizontally adjusted pressure shoe (38) and/or the horizontally adjusted and pivoted guide (34).

A pressure device for wood-cutting machines with an arm which is mounted on a bearing
stand (20) and is pivotable about a horizontal axis and which supports a pressure shoe

(38), displaceable vertically and horizontally and acting upon the top of the workpiece
(18), and a vertically displaceable guide member (34), which presses the workpiece (18)

in the horizontal direction against a stop (16) and which is pivotable about a vertical axis,

characterized in that
 the arm is constructed in the form of a rod (32) which is mounted
longitudinally displaceably in a cylinder (26) articulated to the bearing stand (20) and on

which both the pressure shoe (38) and the guide member (34) are mounted, wherein one
respective clamping ring (50, 50', 50'') which is screwed onto an external thread (42) and

which is mounted coaxially on the rod (32) is provided in each case in order to lock the
rod (32) set in its longitudinal direction and/or the pressure shoe (38) set in the vertical

and horizontal directions and/or the guide member (34) set and pivoted in the vertical
direction.
A pressure device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pressure shoe (38)
and/or the guide member (34) is attached to the lower end of a rectangular frame (36; 94)

which is mounted so as to be vertically adjustable between two vertical guide plates (66,
68; 96, 98) displaceable towards each other in the longitudinal direction of the rod (32).
A pressure device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the two guide plates (66,
68) are pressed with slight pressure against the frame (36) of the pressure shoe (38) by at

least one tension spring (72) in order to lock the frame (36) vertically.
A pressure device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 wedge
elements (46), which are inserted in radial recesses (44) in a threaded bush (40, 40')

mounted coaxially on the rod (32) and carrying the external thread (42) and are radially
displaceable against the outside of the rod (32) by means of the clamping ring (50, 50',

50'') on one respective oblique guide face (48) in each case, are provided in order to lock
the pressure shoe (38) in the longitudinal direction of the rod (32) and/or the rod (32) in

its longitudinal direction.
A pressure device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the rod (32) has a polygonal
cross-section, and the wedge elements (46) are uniformly distributed on its periphery. 
A pressure device according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the threaded bush
(40, 40') is attached to the end of the cylinder (26) remote from the bearing stand (20),

and the oblique guide faces (48) for the wedge elements (46) are formed on the said end.
A pressure device according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the threaded bush
(40') projects from one of the two guide plates (66) for locking the frame (36) of the

pressure shoe (38) vertically and it engages in a central bore in the guide plate (68) which
is situated opposite [the first-mentioned guide plate (66)]
 and on which the oblique guide
faces (48) for the wedge elements (46) are formed.
A pressure device according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the pressure shoe (38) is
mounted on the frame (36) so as to be displaceable vertically
 upwards against a spring
force (compression spring 64).
A pressure device according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the pressure shoe (38)
forms the lower edge of an outer frame (62), the vertical longitudinal uprights (60) of

which are vertically displaceable in guide slots (58) which are formed in the vertical
outer sides of the frame (36).
A pressure device according to one of Claims 2 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the two guide
plates (96, 98) for locking the frame (94) of the guide member (34) vertically are

mounted on a pin (88), which is articulated to the free end (74) of the rod (32) so as to be
pivotable about a vertical axis (pivot pin 90) and the free end of which carries the external

thread (42) for the clamping ring (50'').
A pressure device according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the pin (88) of rectangular
cross-section is constructed at its end remote from the external thread (42) in the form

of a fork (86) which is mounted on the free flattened end (74) of the rod (32) so as to be
pivotable about the pivot pin (90), wherein the flattened end (74) of the rod (32) has a

circular front end (76) with catch recesses (78) into which a catch element (80) inserted
into the fork (86) engages when the clamping ring (50'') is screwed tight in order to lock

the angular setting of the frame (94) of the guide member (34).
