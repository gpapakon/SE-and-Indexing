<ABSTRACT>
Structure which can be used, particularly, in furnishing for producing a volume made up of panels, comprising:   panels (1) which are perforated by means of a cylindrical hole (4) at the edges to be joined, a device (7) for joining and clamping the panels comprising a connection piece (8) with two wings (9, 10) bearing on each panel (1) to be joined, a locking piece (11) composed of two pieces, the first piece (11) being engaged into the hole (4) via one of the faces of the panel while the second piece (11) enters the hole (4) via the other face and fits into the first piece; the locking and clamping being obtained by the rotation of one of the pieces through a quarter of a turn by interaction of the lug (14) of the first which enters the housing (16) of the second while the lug (14) of the second enters the housing (16) of the first.

Structure, namely for being used in furriture for creating a volume 
starting from pannels, comprising: 


pannels (1) perforated by means of a cylindrical hole (4) at the level of 
the sides to be connected, 
a device (7) for connecting and clamping the pannels, comprising a 
connecting part (8) with two wings (9, 10) resting against each pannel 

(1) to be connected, 
 
characterized in that the connecting device (7) is made as follows: 


A) a first locking part (11) comprised of: 

a cylindrical base (12) with the same diameter as the hole (4), 
a cylindrical core (13) with a diameter smaller than the base (12), 
a catch (14) with a length smaller than the diameter of the base (12), 
a recess (16) allowing to receive and lock the catch (14), 
B) a second locking part (11) identical to the first one, 
 
   the first part (11) being inserted into the hole (4) from one face of the 

pannel, whilst the second part (11) penetrates into the hole (4) from the other 
face and fits into the first part, the locking and clamping being achieved 

through a quater-turn rotation of one of the parts, through co-operation of the 
catch (14) of the first one which penetrates into the recess (16) of the second 

one, whilst the catch (14) of the second one penetrates into the recess (16) of 
the first one. 
Structure, namely for being used in furniture for creating a volume 
starting from pannels, according to claim 1, characterized in that the catch (14) 

has an inclined plane (15) at its lower portion and the recess (16) a reversed 
inclined plane at its upper portion, in order to create and improve the clamping. 
Structure, namely for being used in furniture for creating a volume 
starting from pannels, according to claim 1, characterized in that the connecting 

part (8) has the shape of an angle iron with a 90° or another angle. 
Structure, namely for being used in furniture for creating a volume 
starting from pannels, according to claim 1, characterized in that the locking 

parts have a height smaller than the thickness of the pannels. 
Structure, namely for being used in furniture for creating a volume 
starting from pannels, according to claim 1, characterized in that the upper  

 
portion of the locking parts has a size larger than the hole and emerges at (17) 

out of the external faces of the pannel.
