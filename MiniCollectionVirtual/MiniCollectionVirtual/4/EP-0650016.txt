<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of a mechanical 
wiper to remove buildup of combustion products on the 
wall of a waste gas incinerator in which the wiper is 
made from or coated with a corrosive and wear resistant 
material. It is well known that waste gases such as highly 
toxic, pyrophoric and flammable waste gases can be 
safely disposed of by burning the gases in a controlled 
combustion incinerator. A combustion incinerator for 
burning such gases is available commercially under the 
trademark GUARDIAN, which trademark is owned by Hoechst 
A.G. During the combustion of waste gases, combustion 
products are formed that could adhere to the walls of 
the combustion chamber. Generally, the combustion 
chamber is equipped with a thermocouple and at least 
one ignitor port. Heavy deposits of combustion 
products on the thermocouple could result in insulating 
the thermocouple from the heat of the reaction chamber 
and possibly cause a spurious low temperature reading. 
This false reading could activate a safety alarm and 
result in a needless maintenance check on the system. 
The buildup of combustion products on the ignitor ports 
could result in a restriction of the flow of the 
combustion fuel into the chamber to maintain a safe 
operating temperature in the reaction zone. It is also 
possible that the fuel supply from the ignitor port 
could be completely blocked and thus cause an actual 
stoppage of the combustion in the chamber. Without a  
 
permanent flame and flow of fuel in the combustion 
chamber, flammables and pyrophorics may not be 
completely converted to nonflammable materials. It is 
well known that when the waste gas is silane, dilution 
of the silane will not necessarily prevent silane fires 
and explosions. A solution to the problem of combustion product 
buildup is to use pulsed blasts of high pressure clean 
dry air against the side wall of the combustion chamber 
and the face of the thermocouple. When the waste gas 
is silane-based gases or dichlorosilane gases, the 
combustion incinerator burns large quantities of these 
waste gases, frequently at high gas flow rates such as 
from 3 to 6 standard cubic feet per minute. Most of 
the solid combustion product (almost entirely silicon 
dioxide or silica) is entrained with the large air flow 
through the incinerator and is carried downstream where 
it is collected. However, during high flowrate burns, 
solid combustion product builds up rapidly on the wall 
of the combustion's reaction chamber. Under these 
conditions, experience

<CLAIMS>
A waste gas incinerator comprising a 
combustion chamber having an inner wall; first means 

for injecting a combustible fuel into the chamber; 
second means for injecting at least one waste gas into 

the chamber to be burned; ignitor means for igniting 
the combustible fuel; and a mechanical wiper disposed 

within the chamber and adapted to move adjacent at 
least a portion of the inner wall so that buildup of 

products of combustion or reaction adhering to the 
inner wall will be mechanically removed by the wiper. 
The waste gas incinerator of claim 1 wherein 
the combustion chamber has a cap with an inner surface 

disposed over the wall and the mechanical wiper is 
adapted to move adjacent the inner surface of the cap 

so that buildup of products of combustion or reaction 
adhering to the inner surface can be mechanically 

removed by the wiper. 
The waste gas incinerator of claim 1 wherein 
the chamber is a cylindrical chamber having an inner 

upstanding wall and the mechanical wiper comprises a 
rotatable rod axially mounted within said chamber and 

having at least one support rod radially extended from 
the rotatable rod and secured at the end of the support 

rod is a wiper rod aligned parallel to the longitudinal 
axis of the chamber and disposed adjacent the inner 

upstanding wall of the chamber. 
A method of burning waste gases comprising 
the steps: 


(a) feeding into a reaction zone of an 
enclosed incinerator having an inner wall a combustible 

fuel and an oxygen-containing component, and at least 
one waste gas and then igniting said combustible fuel 

to burn said waste gas; 
(b) removing the burnt gas from the 
incinerator; and 
(c) wiping an area adjacent at least a 
portion of the inner wall of the incinerator with a 

moveable internally secured wiper so as to remove 
buildup of combustion or reaction products adhering to 

the upstanding wall. 
The method of claim 4 wherein the inner wall 
contains at least one protruded ignitor port and at 

least one protruded thermocouple and step (c) comprises 
wiping an area adjacent the protruded ignitor port and 

protruded thermocouple with the moveable internally 
secured wiper so as to remove buildup of products of 

combustion or reaction adhering to the ignitor port and 
thermocouple. 
The method of claim 4 wherein the combustible 
fuel is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, 

natural gas and propane, and the inner wall contains at 
least one protruded ignitor port and at least one 

protruded thermocouple and step (c) comprises wiping an 
area adjacent the protruded ignitor port and protruded 

thermocouple with the moveable internally secured wiper 
so as to remove buildup of products of combustion or 

reaction adhering to the ignitor port and thermocouple. 
The method of claim 6 wherein in step (c) the 
wiping is carried on at a constant rate. 
The method of claim 4 wherein in step (a) the 
incinerator comprises a cylindrical structure with an 

upstanding wall and in step (c) the internally moveable 
wiper is disposed adjacent to the upstanding wall and 

parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical 
structure so that said wiper rotates around the 

longitudinal axis of the cylindrical structure.
