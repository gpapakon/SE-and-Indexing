<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a positional 
deviation detecting method and a positional deviation 
detecting system using the same. More particularly, 
the invention is concerned with a rotational deviation 
detecting method and system suitably usable, for 
example, in a microscope sample table for detecting a 
rotational deviation of a sample to be inspected, an 
electron beam drawing apparatus for hologram setting, 
an exposure apparatus, a registration evaluating 
apparatus, a rotary encoder or a yawing detecting 
device, wherein diffraction light from a diffraction 
grating provided on an article to be examined is used 
to detect a rotational deviation of the article. In another aspect, the invention is concerned 
with a positional deviation detecting method and a 
positional deviation detecting system using the same, 
suitably usable in a semiconductor device 
manufacturing exposure apparatus, for measuring 
registration precision (i.e. positional deviation) of 
a printed pattern (such as fine electronic circuit 
pattern) of a mask or reticle (first object), being 
printed on a wafer (second object) through 
lithographic exposure.  
 Many proposals have been made on such a 
structure wherein an article to be examined is placed 
on a sample table of a microscope, and wherein a 
rotational deviation of the sample table with respect 
to the direction of advancement for successive 
observation of small regions of the article, for 
correction of the position of the table. In these 
conventional structures, generally the correction of 
rotational deviation is done on the basis of 
observation of patters provided at opposite ends with 
respect to the advancement direction of the article. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application, Laid-Open 
No. 77273/1988 discloses a system for detecting a 
rotational deviation of an article on the basis is 
image processing to a predetermined pattern. Japanese 
Laid-Open Patent Application, Laid-Open No. 66926/1986 
discloses a rotary encoder for detecting a rotational 
deviation of an article at high precision. There is a first example of known methods for 
measuring a positional deviation of an article to be 
examined, wherein patterns are printed on the article 
and wherein mutual deviation of the patterns is 
measured by using a pattern linewidth measuring 
device. There is a second example of known methods 
(vernier type) wherein gratings of different pitches 
are printed upon an integrated circuit pattern and  
 
wherein the overlapped portions of the gratings are 
read
