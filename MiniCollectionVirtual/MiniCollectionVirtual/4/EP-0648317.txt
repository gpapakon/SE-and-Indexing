<ABSTRACT>
In a series of gear units with increasing torque, each gear unit comprises two or more stages comprising standardised shaft centre distances (c, e) and standardised gear wheels (12, 14) and for any stage of given centre distance and gear ratio the same intermediate pinion shaft is used systematically in a non-stepped two stage housing and symmetrically stepped three stage housings.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a series of gear units of the kind in which the 
series includes gear units of two or more stages and includes gear units 
providing a range of different torques and ratios. It relates also, but not 
exclusively, to a series which may include a variety of input and/or output 
shaft configurations. Custom built gear units can be provided for all kinds of applications, 
this with a certain development and production cost. However, the number 
of variables such as torque, rotating speed, total ratio, number of stages, 
low speed shaft inclination and option of parallel or right angle shafts 
hampers the economic production of custom built gear units. Since the 1950's, it has been known that standardisation of housings 
and rotating parts throughout a catalogued (i.e. predetermined), series of 
gear units can be very important in achieving required quality at minimised 
cost by enabling batch production. For this purpose, GB Patent GB-A-673190 showed how the components can 
be standardised starting from a series of centre distances, which allows eg 
to use a gear set used as a given stage in one size gear unit, as another 
stage in another size. Another example of standardisation of components 
starting from a series of centre distances is disclosed by US-A-3029661. In order to be competitive with custom built gear units, an optimal 
market adequacy of the series has to be aimed at; that is the series needs 
to include as best as possible a range of different size gear units and 
different numbers of stages and ratios etc to meet potential customer needs 
and this must be achieved without adversely affecting manufacturing and 
related costs. This involves an optimal choice of standardisation 
parameters, such as e.g. torque and ratio ranges and the variety of shaft 
configurations available in the series. As an example, GB Patent GB-A-1338610 shows how such an 
optimisation procedure combines internal economy of the series with high 
market adequacy.  
 During the last decades, technical developments have affected the 
extent to which existing standardisation procedures necessarily produced 
an optimum balance between the variables available. The hitherto known standardisation procedures are characterised for 
example by the requirement for a large number of different pinion shafts, or 
by requiring housings of different width for a given size of gear unit so as 
to allow standardisation of high speed pinion shafts. This latter feature does 
however lead to the need to provide

Series of gear units (10,18,30,40,50) with increasing torque of the 
kind in which each gear unit comprises two or more stages comprising 

standardised shaft centre distances (a,c,e...) and standardised gear wheels, 
characterised in that for any stage of given centre distance (e) and gear 

ratio the same intermediate pinion shaft (14) is used systematically in a 
non-stepped two stage housing (11) and stepped three stage housings 

(17,32) which are stepped symmetrically about a plane which extends 
transversely relative to said pinion shaft (14). 
Series of gear units (10,30) according to claim 1 characterised in that 
for any high speed stage of given centre distance (c) and gear ratio the 

same high speed pinion shaft (12) is used systematically in a non-stepped 
two stage housing (11) and a symmetrically stepped three stage housing 

(32). 
Series of gear units according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in 
that pairs of gear units of the series have opposite handing of the shaft 

extension of at least one of the input and output shafts. 
Series of gear units according to claim 3 wherein said pairs of gear 
units are of the same size using the same housing and the internals of one 

gear unit are mounted in a manner which is reversed as compared with that 
of the other gear unit. 
Series of gear units according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the high speed pinion shaft is of the double extension 

type. 
Series of gear units (10,30;40,50) according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the same intermediate or low speed 

stage (14,14') can be combined either with a standardised cylindrical 
(12,12') or a bevel (7,8) high speed gear stage. 
Series of gear units according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that at least some gear units (10,30;40,50) of the series 

comprise housings (11,32) of a kind adapted to receive and locate a high 
speed stage which is either of a cylindrical or a bevel gear type.  

 
Series of gear units (40,50) according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that for any high speed bevel gear stage of given 

size and gear ratio the same bevel gear stage assembly (6,7,8) is used 
systematically in a non-stepped two stage housing (11) and a symmetrically 

stepped three stage housing (32). 
Series of gear units (10,18,30;40,50) according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the housing comprises a bearing block 

(11,17,32) of which at least a part extends continuously between and 
assists in defining the spacing of successive parallel shafts.
