<DESCRIPTION>
Pulmonary hypertension represents a serious, life 
threatening spectrum of diseases of multiple etiology. These 
include congenital abnormalities of the lung, thorax and 
diaphragm, congenital or acquired valvular or myocardial 
disease, obstructive lung disease, and can be a complication of 
autoimmune diseases, vasculitis and collagen based diseases 
(Rubin, Chest. 104: 236, 1993). Patients with pulmonary 
hypertension frequently present with symptoms including dyspnea, 
fatigue, syncope, and chest pain, and have increased pulmonary 
artery pressure and demonstrate prominence of the main pulmonary 
artery, hilar vessel enlargement and decreased peripheral 
vessels on chest radiographs (Rich, Ann. Internal. Med., 107: 
216, 1987). While pulmonary hypertension has multiple etiologies, 
primary pulmonary hypertension appears to involve an autoimmune 
component and has been reported as a complication in patients 
with mixed connective tissue disease, rheumatoid arthritis, 
Sjogren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis and lupus (Sato, Hum.Path., 24: 199, 1993). Primary pulmonary hypertension occurs in 
females 1.7 times more frequently than males with the greatest 
predominance between the third and fourth decades of life (Rich, 
Ann. Internal. Med., 107: 216, 1987). The increased incidence 
of primary pulmonary hypertension in women of child bearing age 
as well as the clinical observations that the disease can be 
exacerbated by pregnancy and oral contraceptives (Miller, Ann.Rheum. Dis. 46: 159, 1987; and cited in Farhat et al., J PET., 
261: 686, 1992) suggests a role for estrogen in the disease 
process. To this extent, Farhat et al. have demonstrated that 
estradiol potentiates the vasopressor response to a thromboxane 
mimetic in perfused rat lungs (J PET, 261: 686, 1992). However, 
the role of estrogen in pulmonary hypertension is complex and 
may be dependent on the etiology of the disease process. In a 
rat model of pulmonary hypertension induced by injection of 
monocrotaline pyrrole (Reindel, Tox. Appl. Pharm., 106: 179, 
1990) progressive pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular 
hypertrophy and interstitial edema around the large airways and  
 
blood vessels becomes apparent, similar to the pathology 
observed in man. Estradiol treatment decreased right 
ventricular hypertrophy and prevented interstitial edema in this 
model (Farhat et al., Br. J. Pharm., 110: 719, 1993) as well as 
attenuating the hypoxic vasoconstrictive response in isolated 
sheep lungs (Gordon et al., J. Appl, Physiol., 61:
