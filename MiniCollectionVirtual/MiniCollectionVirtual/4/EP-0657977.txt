<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor laser diode of a ridge type includes a 
double heterostructure in which a cladding layer (2) is 

formed in a mesa stripe form and a current block layer (8) 
which selectively buries mesa side and bottom surfaces of 

the cladding layer (2). For fabrication, a first step is 
to grow, sequentially above a substrate, a second cladding 

layer (3), an active layer (4), a first cladding layer (5) 
and a cap layer (6). A second step is to etch the first 

cladding layer (5) and the cap layer (6) respectively in 
mesa stripe forms. A third step is to selectively grow 

current blocking layer (7) on the first cladding layer (5) 
by a metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy process. A fourth 

step is to grow contact layers respectively on surfaces of 
the current blocking layer (7) and the cap layer (6). In 

the third step, a gas in which HCl is mixed in a concentration 
within a range of 0.2∼2 in a (HCl)/(III gas) ratio is 

used, which enhances re-evaporation of material on a selective 
mask. Thus, the protrusion formed in the current 

blocking layer (7) at each of the mesa side surfaces can be 
suppressed to a thickness not larger than 10% of a thickness 

of the current blocking layer (7) at its flat portion. 
In this way, the stress caused by lattice mismatch at the 

mesa side portions can be suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser 
diode, and more particularly to a ridge stripe type laser 
diode and a method for fabricating the same. In recent years, extensive researches are in progress 
for attaining a higher output power and a shorter lasing 
wavelength in a semiconductor visible laser diode which 
uses GaInP or AlGaInP in the light emitting layer. An 
example of a laser diode which can reliably operate at more 
than 30 mW at 50°C has been reported in Electronics Letters, 
Vol. 28, No. 9 pp. 860-861, 1992. Also, an example 
of a short wavelength laser diode, wherein 632.7 nm cw 
operation was achieved at 20°C, has been reported in Japanese 
Journal of Applied Physics (JJAP), Vol. 29, No. 9, pp. 
L1669-1671, 1990. Each of the forgoing semiconductor visible laser 
diodes using AlGaInP layers as light emitting layers employs 
a structure wherein a ridged waveguide is selectively 
buried in a GaAs current blocking layer, and this GaAs 
current blocking layer causes a large absorption loss to  
 
occur with respect to an optical waveguide. This absorption 
loss presents a great obstacle to the achievement of 
low threshold currents and high-performance of semiconductor 
laser diodes. The inventor in the present application 
has experimented the use of an AlGaInP layer, which is 
transparent to oscillating wavelengths, in place of a GaAs 
layer for the current blocking layer described above. Fig. 1A is a diagram showing a perspective view of a 
conventional semiconductor laser diode, and Fig. 1B shows a 
composition ratio of (Al+Ga)/In contained in a current 
blocking layer. As shown in Fig. 1A, the current blocking 
layer 11 is constituted by n-AlGaInP. Further, in this 
semiconductor laser diode, a multiquantum-well (MQW) active 
layer 4 is sandwiched between an upper AlGaInP cladding 
layer 5 and a lower AlGaInP cladding layer 3, and there are 
provided a double heterostructure in which the upper cladding 
layer 5 is formed in a mesa stripe shape and a current 
blocking layer 11 which selectively buries the mesa side 
and bottom surfaces of the upper cladding layer 5. In the 
drawings, the numeral 1 depicts an n-GaAs substrate, 2 
depicts an n-GaAs buffer layer, 6 depicts a p-GaInP cap 
layer, 8 depicts a p-GaAs contact layer, 9 depicts a p-electrode 
and 10 depicts an n-electrode. In the foregoing conventional semiconductor laser 
diode, after the cap layer 6 and the cladding layer 5 are  
 
shaped into the mesa stripe form by etching, the current 
blocking layer 11 of
