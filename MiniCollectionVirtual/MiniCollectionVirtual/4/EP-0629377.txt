<ABSTRACT>
The invention is related to a soft-tissue filter apparatus for 
a cephalostat, said apparatus being capable of positioning 

the patent (P) stationary for exposing radiographic images 
of the skull. The apparatus comprises an x-ray source (13) 

whose collimated (14) x-ray beam (XR) can be directed 
through the skull of the patient (P) onto an x-ray film 

(RF) contained in a cassette (23). The apparatus further 
comprises a soft-tissue filter assembly (10) in which to the 

region of one side (a) of the x-ray beam (XR) is placed an 
radiation-absorbing filter element (19) movable by means 

of a drive motor (15) transversely (B) to the x-ray beam 
(XR). The apparatus incorporates a light indicator unit 

(20) comprising a light source (25) capable of projecting 
onto the side of the face of the patient (P) a light marker 

line (LL) which is transferrable along the adjustment 
direction (B) of the soft-tissue filtering assembly. The 

light indicator unit (20) is equipped with a sensor (31) of 
the light marker line (LL) position, said sensor's positional 

information (U
p
) being adapted in the apparatus to 
control the position of the soft-tissue filter element (19) to 

the position relative to the patient (P) indicated by means 
of the light marker line (LL) projected by the light indicator 

unit (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a soft-tissue filter apparatus for a cephalostat, said apparatus being
capable of positioning the patient stationary for exposing radiographic images of the skull
or equivalent structures, to which end said apparatus comprises an x-ray generator whose
collimated x-ray beam can be directed through the patient's skull onto an x-ray film
contained in a cassette, and said apparatus further comprises a soft-tissue filter assembly
in which to the region of one side of the x-ray beam is placed a radiation-absorbing filter
element movable by means of a drive motor transversely to the x-ray beam, and which
apparatus incorporates a light indicator unit comprising a light source.Conventionally known in the transmissive radiographic imaging of the skull is the use of a
cephalostat available as an accessory for a panoramic x-ray apparatus. A radiographic
image exposed with the help of the cephalostat is chiefly capable of presenting the bone
structure of the skull alone as the soft-tissues adjacent to the skull become overexposed
thus forming black areas in the image. However, a frequent need exists for taking such
radiographic images of the skull in which also the soft-tissues are well discernible. To this
end, prior art has conventionally employed typically wedge-shaped soft-tissue enhancing
filters, which are placed between the object being imaged and the x-ray film. These
soft-tissue filters are adapted such positioning arrangements that permit their use for
locally attenuating the x-ray beam transmitted through, e.g., the patient's face thus making
the soft-tissues discernible in the radiographic image. A problem herein is how to position
the soft-tissue filters correctly so as to achieve the highest possible resolution in the
radiographic image simultaneously for both the bone structure of the skull and the desired
soft-tissues adjoining thereto. Frequently, such radiographic images are so inferior in this
respect that a number of re-exposures must be taken, which increases operating costs and
subjects the patient to unnecessary doses of radiation.For an attempt to solve the above-described problem, reference is made to FI patent
68515 (corresponding US patent 4,641,336) filed by Instrumentarium Oy, Finland, in
which a soft-tissue filter arrangement is described for use in the radiographic imaging of a
patient's skull with the help of a cephalostat in which the patient is adjusted to a accurately 
determined imaging position by means of ear plugs or similar elements which comprise
ear,
