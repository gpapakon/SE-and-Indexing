<ABSTRACT>
A scramble system of the present invention 
including a scramble apparatus and a descramble apparatus 

is applied to a recording and reproducing system or a 
transmission and receiving system wherein a frame of a 

digital video signal composed of a plurality of frames is 
divided into a plurality of predetermined fundamental video 

blocks corresponding to recording and reproducing 
processes. Either one of the recording and reproducing 

system and the transmission and receiving system executes 
a reconstruction process such as an interpolation process, 

a high speed playback process or the like. The scramble 
apparatus executes a scramble process on the inputted 

digital video signal in the identical processing manner 
using the fundamental video blocks in the identical 

position in each of the frames and generates a scrambled 
video signal, while the descramble apparatus effects 

reverse conversion of the scramble process executed by the 
scramble apparatus using the fundamental video blocks on 

the scrambled video signal generated by the scramble 
apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scramble 
system for use in either a recording and reproducing system 
such as a digital video recorder or the like, or a 
transmission and receiving system for use through 
communication line such as an optical, coaxial or wireless 
communication line, in particular, to a scramble system 
comprising a scramble apparatus for scrambling a digital 
video signal and a descramble apparatus for descrambling 
the scrambled digital video signal, wherein, in further 
particular, the scrambled digital video signal is 
transmitted through an optical, wire or wireless 
communication line, or the scrambled digital video signal 
is recorded into a recording medium such as a magnetic 
tape, a magnetic disk, a magneto-optical disk, a compact 
disk or the like. A conventional scramble and descramble system  
 
including a scramble apparatus and a descramble apparatus 
is disclosed in, Lebrat, "Method and Device for Scrambling-unscrambling 
Digital Image Data", United States Patent No. 
5,208,857, as issued on May 4, 1993 (referred to as a first 
reference document 1 hereinafter). The conventional 
scramble and descramble system is used in a digital video 
recording or transmission system, in which a video signal 
is compressed according to the DCT (Discrete Cosine 
Transform) compression method in the unit of a DCT block 
composed of a plurality of pixels, and then the compressed 
video signal is recorded onto a magnetic recording medium 
such as a magnetic tape or disk or is transmitted through 
a communication line. In the conventional scramble and descramble 
apparatus, a video signal prior to the compression process 
is subjected to a scramble process by replacing DCT blocks 
thereof, while the compressed and decompressed video signal 
is subjected to a descramble process by inversely replacing 
the DCT blocks thereof. When performing the scramble 
process, the video signal located in each DCT block does 
not change, and therefore, the video image can be scrambled 
without any influence on the compression efficiency. Further, there has been proposed a digital video 
recording and reproducing system as disclosed in C. 
Yamamitsu et al., "A Study on Trick Plays for Digital VCR",  
 
IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, Vol. 37, No. 3, 
August 1991 (referred to as a second reference document 
hereinafter). The conventional digital video recording and 
reproducing system performs not only a process for 
interpolating an error in reproducing a recorded image 
signal but also a
