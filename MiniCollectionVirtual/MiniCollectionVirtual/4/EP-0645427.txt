<ABSTRACT>
A mica-reinforced propylene resin composition 
having a volatile matter at 105°C of 0.12% or less is 

obtained by heating and melting a mixture containing (A) 
a crystalline polypropylene, (B) mica treated with an 

organosilane compound, (C) a bismaleimide compound, and 
(D) an organic peroxide. It has excellent stiffness, 

heat resistance and dimensional stability, does not 
corrode a mold, and does not exhale an irritating odor 

during molding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mica-reinforced 
propylene resin composition. Propylene resins, which have good mechanical 
properties, chemical properties, thermal properties and 
moldability, are widely used for making industrial 
parts. Compositions containing a propylene resin and 
one or more various fillers also possess an improved 
stiffness, heat resistance and dimensional stability. 
In particular, mica-reinforced polypropylenes 
containing a propylene resin and mica are superior in 
stiffness, heat resistance and dimensional stability. 
However, use of a mere blend of a polypropylene and mica 
does not give a molded product having desirable mechanical 
and thermal properties (e.g. tensile strength, 
flexural strength and heat distortion temperature) due 
to weak binding between the propylene resin and mica. JP-A-55-104338 and JP-B-58-17544 disclose a 
method for improving the reinforcing effect in mica-reinforced 
polypropylenes which comprises treating the 
surface of mica with an organosilane compound and modifying 
a polypropylene with an unsaturated carboxylic 
acid. However, along the recent trend of severe 
requirement for the balance in physical properties, the 
appearance of molded articles has become regarded as an  
 
important performance. As mentioned above, an unsaturated carboxylic 
acid is used for modification of polypropylenes to enhance 
the reinforcing effect. Employment of a material 
such as an unsaturated carboxylic acid, however, causes 
the corrosion of a mold during a long-term molding of 
mica-reinforced polypropylenes. The corrosion of a 
mold, in turn, greatly damages the surface appearance of 
molded products. Moreover, employment of a material 
such as an unsaturated carboxylic acid exhales during 
the molding an irritating odor which hurts the eyes and 
nose. Therefore, there has been a request of improving 
the environment of a molding site. The propylene resin 
compositions containing a polypropylene modified with an 
unsaturated carboxylic acid are not free from the above 
defects. There has not been reported a mica-reinforced 
polypropylene with a good balance in physical properties 
which does not corrode a mold and solves the problem of 
the environment of the molding site.  
 JP-A-63 178 153 discloses a process for producing a filler-containing 
propylene polymer composition which comprises 
melting, heating and kneading 0.1-5 parts by weight of a monomer 
selected from unsaturated carboxylic acids and their 
derivatives, 0.01-1 part by weight of an
