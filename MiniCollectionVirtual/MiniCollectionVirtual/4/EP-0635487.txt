<ABSTRACT>
Process for the purification of ε-caprolactam, 
which involves hydrogenation of a water-ε-caprolactam 

mixture with hydrogen of the mixture in the presence of a 
heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst, wherein first the ε-caprolactam-water 

mixture is contacted with gaseous 
hydrogen, upon which hydrogen dissolves in the ε-caprolactam-water 

mixture, and subsequently this hydrogen-containing 
mixture is contacted with the hydrogenation 

catalyst and that 90-100% of the hydrogen present during 
hydrogenation has been dissolved in the water-ε-caprolactam 

mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the
purification of ε-caprolactam which involves hydrogenation
of a water-ε-caprolactam mixture with hydrogen in the
presence of a heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst.To obtain ε-caprolactam of the purity required
for polymerization to nylon 6, impure ε-caprolactam,
prepared by for example Beckmann rearrangement of
cyclohexanone oxime, is subjected to a number of
purification steps. One of these purification steps is the
hydrogenation, as referred to here, of a mixture
consisting substantially of water and ε-caprolactam and
some unsaturated impurities. Hydrogenation of water-ε-caprolactam
mixtures are carried out to hydrogenate these
unsaturated compounds present in the impure ε-caprolactam.
The presence of these unsaturated compounds are
disadvantageous because they can impair the physical-mechanical
properties of the nylon-6 made by polymerizing
ε-caprolactam. The saturated compounds formed by
hydrogenation do not adversely influence these physical-mechanical
properties of the nylon-6 and moreover these
compounds are more easily removed in for example a
distillation step following the hydrogenation step.Such a process is described in EP-A-411455.
From FR-A-1388442, EP-A-138241, FR-A-1337527, FR-A-1332193,
Can. J. Chem. Eng. 60, 319 (1982) and DE-B-1253716 it is also
known to purify ε-caprolactam with hydrogen in the
presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. 
EP-A-411455 describes the purification, in a three-phase
system (gas, liquid, solid), of a 75-95 wt.% aqueous ε-caprolactam
mixture in which the water-ε-caprolactam
mixture and gaseous hydrogen are passed from the bottom
upwards through a fixed bed consisting of a supported
palladium or nickel catalyst. In this known method the amount of hydrogen fed
to the reactor is relatively large, compared with the
amount of hydrogen consumed during the reaction. The
residual amount of hydrogen is incinerated or recirculated
to the hydrogenation reaction. In the latter case the
hydrogen is passed through a compressor to ensure that it
has the correct pressure when it is returned to the
reactor. A drawback of this process is that large amounts
of hydrogen have to be processed which will result in more
safety measures, because of the nature of hydrogen. A
further drawback of this method is that the system
requires a relatively large compressor to keep a large
amount of hydrogen in circulation. When the residual
amount of hydrogen is incinerated economics prove to be
unattractive because the burning value of hydrogen is less
