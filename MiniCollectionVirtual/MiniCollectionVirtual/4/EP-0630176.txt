<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an electrical assembly having at least one component which produces heat and is arranged on one side of a printed circuit board whose other side can make contact with a main printed circuit board, copper layers (3, 5, 22) which can be connected to one another by means of through-plated holes (4, 23) are provided on both sides of the printed circuit board (6) in addition to conductor tracks (10) and possibly existing through-plated holes which represent electrical connections between the sides of the printed circuit board (6). The copper layer (3) on one side is thermally conductively connected to the component (1). The copper layer (5, 22) on the other side has means (7, 24) for thermally conductive connection to the main printed circuit board.

Electrical assembly having at least one
heat-generating component arranged on one side of a

printed circuit board, copper layers (3, 5, 22) being
provided in addition to conductor tracks (10) and

optionally present plated-through holes, which
constitute electrical connections between the sides of

the printed circuit board (6), on both sides of the
printed circuit board (6) and being interconnected by

plated-through holes (4, 23), and the copper layer (3)
on one side of the printed circuit board being

thermally conductively connected to the component (1),
characterized in that the copper layer (5, 22) on the

other side of the printed circuit board has, for the
purpose of a thermally conductive connection to a main

printed circuit board, soldering points produced by the
soldering of solder balls (7, 24).
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the copper layers (3, 5, 22) essentially cover

that area of the component (1) which faces the printed
circuit board (6, 21), and in that the plated
-through
holes (4, 23) and the means (7, 24) for a thermally

conductive connection to the main printed circuit board
are distributed in the form of a grid on the covered

area.
Assembly according to Claim 2, characterized in
that conductor tracks (9, 10), further solder balls

(25) and further plated-through holes are provided on
the edges of the covered area for the purpose of 

connecting the component (1) to the main printed
circuit board.
Assembly according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the component is provided

with a thermally conductive cap (31, 32), which is
thermally conductively connected to the copper layer on

the one side of the printed circuit board.
