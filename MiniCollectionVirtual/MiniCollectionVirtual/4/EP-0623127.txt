<ABSTRACT>
Compounds of formula (I) have been shown to enhance the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and thus may be useful in the treatment of diseases of man, such as in Alzheimer's disease and other conditions involving learning and cognition, where subnormal levels of this neurochemical are found. The compounds of this invention can be described as shown in formula (I) where Q is (a) or (b), A and B are independently selected from the group including H, R

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to disubstituted polycyclic compounds, to 
pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and to the use of said 
compounds for preparing a medicament for treating 
cognitive disorders, neurological dysfunction, and/or mood 
disturbances such as, but not limited to degenerative nervous system 
diseases. Additionally, these compounds can be used as reagents in 
studies on the biochemical mechanism of neurotransmitter based 
diseases. Increasingly there is a need for effective treatments for nervous 
system disorders and neurological deficiencies. Many of these diseases 
correlate with increasing age due mainly to degenerative changes in the 
nervous systems. Although in early stages of some diseases, certain 
systems are rather specifically affected (e. g., cholinergic systems in 
Alzheimer's Disease and Myasthenia Gravis, the dopaminergic system in 
Parkinson's Disease, etc.), multiple neurotransmitter system deficiencies 
(acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin) are generally 
found at later stages of disease such as senile dementia, multi- infarct 
dementia, Huntington's Disease, mental retardation, etc. This explains 
the generally observed multiple symptomatology that includes cognitive, 
neurological, and effective/psychotic components (see Gottfries, 
Psychopharmacol., 1985, 86, 245). Deficits in the synthesis and release 
of acetylcholine in the brain are generally thought to be related to 
cognitive impairment (see Francis, et al., New England J. Med., 1985, 7, 
313) whereas neurological deficits (e. g. Parkinsonian symptoms) and 
mood/mental changes may be related to impairment of dopaminergic 
and serotonergic systems, respectively. Other neurological deficits (e. g. 
Myasthenia Gravis) are related to cholinergic deficiencies in the  
 
peripheral nervous system. Treatment strategies employed previously encompass vasoactive 
drugs like vincamine and pentoxifylline; metabolic enhancers like 
ergoloid mesylates, piracetam, and naftidrofuryl; neurotransmitter 
precursors like I-DOPA, choline, and 5-hydroxytryptamine; transmitter 
metabolizing enzyme inhibitors such as physostigmine; and 
neuropeptides like adrenocorticotropic hormone and vasopressin-related 
peptides. Except for I-DOPA treatment for Parkinson's Disease and 
cholinesterase inhibitor treatment for Myasthenia Gravis, these treatment 
strategies have generally failed to enhance the residual function of the 
affected systems by enhancing the stimulus-induced release of 
neurotransmitters. Theoretically, such
