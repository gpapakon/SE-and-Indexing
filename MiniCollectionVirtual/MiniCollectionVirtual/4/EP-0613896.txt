<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing 
sulfonylurea derivatives of formula (I) in a high purity and 

a high yield characterized in that a sulfonylchloride of formula 
(V) is reacted with 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine of formula 

(VII) in the presence of a metal cyanate and an organic base 
catalyst or a compound of formula (VIII) is reacted with 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine 

of formula (VII): 

wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, C₁-C₄ alkyl or phenyl, R² represents 
hydrogen, C₁-C₄ alkyl, allyl or propargyl and R³ represents 

hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or phenyl, and to a process for preparing 
the sulfonylchloride compound of formula (V) above and the compound 

of formula (VIII) above, both of which are useful as an 
intermediate compound for preparing the sulfonylurea derivative 

of formula (I) and to a novel intermediate compound of formula 
(VIII) as defined above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparation
of sulfonylurea-based derivatives. Particularly, the
present invention relates to a novel process for preparation of
sulfonylurea derivatives having the following general formula
(I),

wherein
R1represents hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl or phenyl;R2represents hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, allyl or propargyl; andR3 represents hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or phenyl.The sulfonylurea derivative of formula (I) above is a known
herbicide compound and processes for preparing the same are
disclosed in numerous publications. For example, European Early
Published Patent No. 87,780 discloses the three methods for
preparing the compound (I), in which the first method comprises
reacting an isocyanate of formula (II) with an amine compound of
formula (VII); the second method comprises reacting an amine of
formula (III) with an isocyanate of formula (VI); and the third
method comprises reacting a carbamate of formula (IV) with an
amine compound of formula (VII):

wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above.Both the first and second methods as described above are the
general methods for preparing sulfonylurea derivatives by synthesizing
and separating isocyanates which are then reacted with
amines. However, the isocyanate used as the starting material in
these methods is synthesized by reacting the amine derivative of 
formula (III) or (VII) with a poisonous substance, phosgene.
Accordingly, such methods using the isocyanate have some disadvantages
in that mass use of phosgene in the industrial scale
requires a special safety equipment, hydrochloric acid produced
as by-product should be treated and the remaining phosgene should
be recovered. Further, when the compound of formula (I) is
prepared by reacting such isocyanate compound with the amine
derivative, the yield of the desired product (I) is as low as 70
to 80%.Moreover, as shown in the following reaction scheme, the
first method produces the sulfonylurea derivative of formula (I)
starting from the sulfonylchloride of formula (V) via the isocyanate
of formula (II) according to a complicated multi-step
procedure. Accordingly, this first method is disadvantageous in
application to the mass production in the industrial scale.
In addition, the third method as described above is a method
identical to the method described in Japanese Laying-open Patent
Publication No. (Hei) 03-200742 which requires a stringent reaction
condition including high reaction temperature and produces
the desired product (I) in a low yield. Therefore,
