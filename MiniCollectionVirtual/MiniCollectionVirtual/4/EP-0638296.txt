<ABSTRACT>
For intensive cleaning of medical, especially dental articles such as instruments, dental braces or the like, it is proposed that the articles be exposed to a pulsatingly supplied cleaning liquid, a gas being pulsatingly supplied at a higher pressure to the cleaning liquid in the interpulse periods. The device comprises a cassette (12) in which the articles are placed, and a chamber (2) which can be closed in pressure-tight fashion and in which the cassette is inserted and in which the process takes place. Adapters (16) are provided in the cassette for mounting the articles. A large number of nozzles (44) is arranged around each article, and the cleaning liquid can be supplied via these nozzles.

Process for the intensive cleaning of medical,
in particular dental, instruments, and other articles

which may fall within the area of application thereof,
with the aid of a cleaning fluid which is supplied

under pressure and is discharged via nozzles (44) in a
manner in which it is directed onto the instruments or

articles, characterized in that the cleaning fluid is
supplied with pulsing action and, in the pauses between

pulses of the liquid supply, air is introduced with
pulsing action, at higher pressure, into the supply

line (47) of the cleaning fluid to the nozzles (44).
Apparatus for the intensive cleaning of
medical, in particular dental, instruments, 
and other
articles which may fall within the area of application

thereof, containing a module (12) which receives the
articles (13, 14) and can be positioned in a chamber

(2) which can be closed off in a pressure-tight manner,
the module containing adapters (16) for securing the

articles, characterized in that the module (12)
contains a multiplicity of nozzles (44) which are

directed onto the instruments, are arranged around the
secured articles and via which it is possible to supply

the cleaning fluid for treating the outer surfaces of
the articles, and in that there is provided a control

device (50) which controls the supply of air, on the
one hand, and of cleaning fluid, on the other hand,

such that the cleaning fluid is supplied with pulsing
action and, in the pauses between pulses of the fluid 

supply, air is introduced with pulsing action, at
higher pressure, into the supply line (47) of the

cleaning fluid to the nozzles (44).
Apparatus according to Claim 2, in the case of
which, at least for articles (13) which have

media-carrying ducts (27, 28) and moving inner parts
(25), the adapters (16) contain means (24) for securing

the articles (13) and means (33, 35) for supplying
fluid and gaseous media for treating the moving inner

parts (25) and the media-carrying ducts (27, 28).
Apparatus according to Claims 2 or 3, in the
case of which the nozzles (44) are arranged on parts of

the chamber (2), and the module (12) is provided with
openings for the supply and discharge of the treatment

media.
Apparatus according to Claims 2 or 3, in the
case of which the nozzles (44) are arranged on parts of

the module (12), and the module is provided with
openings for the supply and discharge of the treatment

media.
Apparatus according to Claim 4, in the case of
which the nozzles (44) are arranged on nozzle arms (3)

which extend along the chamber (2) and are fastened,
and arranged, at the rear end of the chamber (2) such

that the surfaces of the articles are subjected to the
action of the treatment media to the full extent, a

rear wall (15) of the module (12) being provided with
openings (17) through which the nozzle arms (3) engage

when the module is pushed into the chamber (2).
Apparatus according to Claims 4 or 5, in the
case of which the nozzles (44) are located on nozzle

arms (3) which are arranged at an angle of 120Â° with
respect to one another around the articles.
Apparatus according to Claim 7, in the case of
which the nozzles (44) are arranged along the nozzle

arms (3) such that they are offset by a small angle
with respect to one another in relation to a reference

plane running through the longitudinal axis. 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, in the case of
which the offset positioning is such that the nozzles

(44) run in an alternating manner above and beneath the
reference plane.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 6 to 9, in
the case of which the nozzle arms (3) are arranged

around the articles (13) such that the nozzles (44) of
three nozzle arms (3) are active for one adapter (16).
Apparatus according to Claim 10, in the case of
which at least one common nozzle arm (3) is provided

for two adjacent adapters (16).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to 11,
in the case of which the adapter (16) is secured on the

rear wall (15) of the module (12) such that it can
easily be exchanged.
Apparatus according to Claim 12, in the case of
which at least one adapter (16) is provided for

securing a dental instrument (13) which has line ducts
(27, 28) for supplying the treatment media into the

interior of the instrument.
Apparatus according to Claim 13, in the case of
which the adapter (16) contains a control valve (32)

which closes off the supply lines (33, 35) when the
adapter (16) is not occupied by an instrument (13).
Apparatus according to Claim 13, in the case of
which a plurality of adapters (16) are provided for

different instruments (13), the adapters having the
same connection dimensions as far as being secured on

the housing wall (15) is concerned.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to 15,
in the case of which the module (12) comprises two

housing halves (12a, 12b) which are formed by being
divided transversely and can be connected to one

another, the base-side housing half (12a) bearing the
adapter(s) (16), and the top-side housing half (12b)

having guide elements (4) for guiding the module (12)
in the chamber (2) of the unit.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 6 to 11,
in the case of which the openings (17) in the module 

(12) for the through-passage of the nozzle arms (3) are
