<ABSTRACT>
A new process of interpolymerizing ethylene interpolymer products having improved properties, such as increased onset of crystallization temperature, is disclosed. Preferably, the process comprises interpolymerizing a first homogeneous ethylene/alpha-olephin interpolymer and at least one second homogeneous ethylene/alpha-olephin interpolymer using at least two constrained geometry catalysts having different reactivities such that the first ethylene/alpha-olephin interpolymer has a narrow molecular weight distribution (NMWD) with a very high comonomer content and relatively high molecular weight and the second ethylene/alpha-olefin interpolymer has a NMWD with a low comonomer content and a molecular weight lower than that of the first interpolymer. The resultant first homogeneous interpolymer is combined with the resultant second homogeneous interpolymer in appropriate weight ratios resulting in the desired finished polymer structure. The first interpolymer and the second interpolymer can be polymerized in a single reactor or they can be polymerized in separate reactors operated in parallel or series.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes of manufacturing ethylene interpolymer 
products which have improved properties, especially increased onset of crystallization 
temperature. The ethylene interpolymer products are made by a polymerization with two or 
more constrained geometry catalysts having varying reactivities. The interpolymer products 
can also be made by polymerization reactions in two or more separate, parallel reactors, with 
the resultant interpolymers intimately combined. Thermoplastic polymers can be classified as semi-crystalline (at least partly 
crystalline), highly crystalline, or wholly or mainly amorphous Crystalline or semi-crystalline 
polymers typically have a distinct melting point, as measured by differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC). Crystalline and semi-crystalline polymers are typically melt-processed into 
fibers, films or molded articles. Controlling the nucleation and crystallization rates of the polymers during melt 
processing is important in determining the physical properties of the finished article. Various 
methods of controlling nucleation and crystallization have been attempted, usually 
incorporating nucleating agents (for example, inactive (physical) or active (chemical)) or 
completely changing polymers. Physical nucleating agents are typically finely divided particles 
and have a melting and freezing temperature greater than that of the polymer in which the 
particles are utilized while the chemical nucleating agents are primarily combinations of acidic 
and basic compounds such as organic or inorganic compounds. Unfortunately, the particulate 
nucleating agents can also detrimentally affect the physical properties of the final product, for 
example by lowering the tensile strength of film made from the polymers. Copending Application WO-a-9 207 905 has 
solved this particulate nucleation problem by blending linear polyethylene with other 
polyethylenes to cause the blend to have an increased onset of crystallization. While this 
process is effective, economic considerations can also affect the ability of polymers to be melt 
blended cost effectively.  
 Many methods of polymerizing polymers and forming polymer blends to do 
specific jobs are disclosed in the literature. For example, U.S. Patent 4,937,299 (Ewen et al.) 
teaches the use of a homogeneous catalyst system comprising at least two different mono-, di-or 
tricyclopentadienyls and their derivatives of a Group 4b, Sb and 6b transition metal each 
having different reactivity ratios and aluminoxane.
