<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gas premix burner, preferably a radiant burner, intended particularly for burning gas in heating boilers. The said premix burner has a hollow body (5), which is preferably made from special-steel mesh and to which the premixed gas/air mixture is fed by a fan (9) via a gas inlet chamber (10) formed inside the hollow body (5), the said chamber being bounded by at least one gas distributor (6a, 6b). The burner furthermore comprises a fan drive motor (14), control and shut-off devices for the gas and an air feed conduit for the combustion air. In order to provide a burner which is not only compact but can also be brought into operation rapidly and generates only small quantities of unburnt hydrocarbons when switched off, the fan (9) is arranged within the hollow body (5).
