 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR REGULATING CELLULAR SIGNAL TRANSDUCING SYSTEMSCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 802,370, filed December 4, 1991, which is a continuation of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 170,737, filed March 21, 1988 (now U.S. Patent No. 5,100,661).BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFundamental to cells is the response to stimulation of cell surface receptors by external signals. While there are a number of different receptors embedded within the plasma membrane, and a variety of such external signals, e.g., hormones, blood and growth factors, neurotransmitters, and radiation of a specific wavelength, there are a limited number of internal signals or second messengers employed within the cell. A second messenger is one that activates an appropriate cellular response to a specific external signal. It becomes activated when the receptor stimulated by an external signal excites an internal molecule, e.g., an enzyme, which in turn stimulates the production of a second messenger substance.An early signal transduction system identified in the art was the beta adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase pathway. This system 

employs the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a derivative of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) . Its mechanism of action is now understood to proceed as follows: the external signal-receptor complex interacts with a guanine nucleotide binding protein called a G-protein. G-protein activates adenylate cyclase, which in its activated form can catalyze the production of the second messenger, cAMP, from ATP. cAMP, in turn, causes cellular activity, e.g., protein synthesis, secretion, cytos eletal movement, constituting a cellular response.G-proteins are a class of regulatory proteins which bind guanosine di- and triphosphate nucleotides, i.e., GDP and GTP, respectively. The family of G-proteins serves as peripherally membrane-bound signal transducing polypeptides, coupling activation of cell surface receptors to the regulation of intracellular effectors. These proteins can activate the enzymatic abilities of adenylate cyclase or a phosphodiesterase while binding GTP. Examples of known and probable G-proteins include Gs and Gi, which are responsible for the regulation of adenylate cyclase; transducin, which activates a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase in the retina; ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) in the liver (Kahn et al. -L. Biol. Chem. 25_9_:6228-6234, 1984); and P21, the product of the
