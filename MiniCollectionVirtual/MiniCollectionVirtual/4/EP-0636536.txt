<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electrically power assisted 
bicycle wherein the electrical power assist components are 

comprised of an electric motor (43) and transmission as one unit and a 
battery (46) as another unit. The electrical motor (43) and the 

electrical 
battery (46) are disposed substantially weight-balanced with respect 

to the crank axis of a manually operated crankshaft. In this way, 
a low center of gravity and improved manoeuvrability of the 

bicycle is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrically power assisted bicycle comprising a frame, a front
wheel to be dirigibly supported by said frame, a rear wheel journalled for rotation by said
frame, a seat carried by said frame for accommodating a rider, a pedal assembly journalled
by the frame for rotation about a transverse crank axis for operation by the rider
seated on said seat, a drive means coupling said pedal assembly to said rear wheel for
manually driving said rear wheel, and an electrical power assist mechanism for transmitting
a driving force to said rear wheel through said drive means and comprising an electrical
motor and an electrical battery for providing electrical power to said electrical motor.Such an electric power assisted bicycle is known from GB-A-2 083 423 according to
which the electric motor is disposed in the frame member or at least coaxially with this
frame member. Thereby, said frame member extends generally vertical in use and, in
addition, this frame member or the respective axis thereof extends through the output
shaft (crank axis) so that this motor has still no lever arm with respect to the crank axis.
Therefore, this electric motor cannot be balanced by any of the other parts, especially not
by the battery. Moreover, the center of gravity of the battery has a large lever arm and
therefore imparts a relatively large moment of rotation about this crank axis.Moreover, electrically power assisted bicycles of the type shown in
European Patent Applications 0 559 231, 0 590 674, 0 517 224
and 0 569 954, have a number of advantages. In the construction
shown in each of those applications and the aforenoted patent,
the bicycle is provided with a conventional pedal mechanism
operated by the rider. In addition, there is provided an electric motor powered
by a battery and controller arrangement for assisting the
operator effort in response to the pedal input force so as to
make the riding of the bicycle easier while at the same time
maintaining its ability to provide exercise for the rider.
In the arrangements shown in those applications, the motor
and its driving transmission are disposed in a generally
vertically orientation either aligned with or beneath the
seat pillar. The battery and controller are disposed in a
somewhat horizontally extending position along the main frame
member that extends from the head pipe downwardly toward the
pedal mechanism. Although this arrangement has a number of
advantages, it tends to move the center of gravity of the
bicycle generally forwardly of
