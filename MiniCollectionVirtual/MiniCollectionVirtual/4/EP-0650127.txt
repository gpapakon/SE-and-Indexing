<ABSTRACT>
A digital signal processing circuit, which is configured by 
a digital signal processor (i.e., DSP), comprises at least a data 

memory (DR), a coefficient memory (CR), a calculation portion 
(MX) and an interpolation portion (INT). The data memory stores 

a plurality of digital data which are sequentially supplied 
thereto, while the coefficient memory stores a plurality of 

coefficients in connection with the plurality of digital data. 
The calculation portion performs a specific calculation (e.g., 

multiplication), using the coefficient, on the digital data. 
When a new coefficient is given with respect to one of the 

coefficients designated, the interpolation portion performs 
interpolation processing on the designated coefficient so as to 

successively shift it to the new coefficient. The coefficient 
successively shifted is stored in the coefficient memory. Hence, 

the calculation portion performs the calculation, using the 
coefficient successively shifted, on the digital data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital signal processing
circuit which is suitable for use in digital audio devices and
the like.The known digital signal processor (i.e., DSP) is capable of
performing a fade-in operation as well as a fade-out operation by
performing multiplication, using predetermined coefficients, on
digital signals inputted thereto; or the DSP is capable of
combining those operations so as to perform cross-fade operations
by which an sound effect (or acoustic effect) to be imparted to
input signals is varied with respect to time.FIG. 4 shows a simple configuration for the circuit which
performs the cross-fade operations.In the circuit shown in FIG. 4, an input signal applied to
an input terminal is delivered to filters F1 and F2. Output
signals of the filters F1 and F2 are respectively supplied to
multipliers K1 and K2 in which they are multiplied by respective
coefficients. Then, outputs of the multipliers K1 and K2 are
added together by an adder ADD, so that a result of addition is
outputted through an output terminal.If the sound effect to be imparted to the input signal is
not subjected to time-related variation, the multiplication
coefficient used by the multiplier K1 is set at '1', while the
multiplication coefficient used by the multiplier K2 is set at
'0', so that only the output signal of the filter F1 is
outputted.On the other hand, when the sound effect is subjected to 
time-related variation, a filter coefficient of the filter F2 is
renewed; and then the multiplication coefficient of the
multiplier K2 is gradually increased up to '1' from '0' while the
multiplication coefficient of the multiplier K1 is gradually
decreased to '0' from '1'. Those operations will realize the
cross-fade operations in the circuit shown in FIG. 4. According
to the cross-fade operations, the sound effect to be imparted to
the input signals is gradually shifted from a first sound effect,
corresponding to a filtering characteristic of the filter F1, to
a second sound effect corresponding to a filtering characteristic
of the filter F2.In order to perform arithmetic operations by using a great
number of coefficients, the DSP performs convolution operations.
Herein, a digital signal of one word is supplied to the DSP in
each sampling period; hence, the DSP stores those digital signals
in turn. Thus, the DSP performs the convolution operations on a
certain amount of digital signals which are stored therein within
a certain period of time.As described above, the DSP inputs a new sample of data
