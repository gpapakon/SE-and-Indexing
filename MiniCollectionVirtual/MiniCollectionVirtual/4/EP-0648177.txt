<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for supplying a packaging machine, in particular a candy packaging machine, with packaging material. A strip (1) of packaging material is drawn from a supply reel (2) by a pair of drawing cylinders (4, 4') and is cut by a cutting device (8, 9) into sections of packaging material having a predetermined length. During each working cycle of the machine, a section of packaging material is supplied to a wrapping station and the pre-adjustable length of the sections of packaging material is regulated by a regulating circuit (20) which includes the drive of the pair of drawing cylinders. The speed of rotation of a shaft (8) that bears a rotating knife of the cutting device and the speed of rotation of the driven drawing cylinders (4, 4') of the pair of drawing cylinders are continuously determined during each working cycle of the packaging machine. The value of the speed of rotation for the drawing cylinders is calculated taking into account the circumference of the drawing cylinders as well as the desired length of the sections of packaging material and is immediately set by means of a highly dynamic drive (9) linked to a control device.

Method for the supplying of packaging means to a wrapping machine, 
in particular sweets wrapping machine, wherein at least one packaging 

means band is drawn off from at least one band supply spool by a 
withdrawal roller pair and separated by a cutting equipment into 

packaging means portions of predetermined withdrawal length and one 
packaging means portion for each machine cycle is fed to a wrapping 

station for the wrapping of one packaging item, in particular sweets, 
wherein the presettable withdrawal length of the packaging means 

portion is regulated by a regulating loop containing the drive of the 
withdrawal roller pair, characterised thereby, that increments of a 

rotational speed of a blade shaft (8) of a rotating blade (9) of the 
cutting equipment as well as of a rotational speed of at least one 

withdrawal roller (4') of the withdrawal roller pair are ascertained 
successively within each machine cycle and set into relationship each 

to the other and, subject to consideration of the circumference of the 
withdrawal roller (4'), the preselected withdrawal length as well as 

the rotational speed ratio of the blade shaft (8) and the withdrawal 
roller (4'), a rotational speed value corresponding to this withdrawal 

length is computed for the the withdrawal roller (4') and a drive (19) 
of the withdrawal roller (4') is controlled for reaching this computed 

rotational speed value in the next following machine cycle. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that on 
ascertaining the absence of a packaging item (B) for one machine cycle 

and beginning with the instant of the severing of the preceding 
packaging means portion, the withdrawal roller (4') is driven in 

opposite sense of rotation with retraction of the packaging means band 
(1) and incremental detection of a retraction travel and subsequently 

stopped within the same machine cycle with the packaging means band (1) 
in a defined starting position with reference to a downstream cutting 

edge of the rotating blade (9).  
 
Method according to claim 2, characterised thereby, that the amount 
of a retraction of the packaging means band (1) behind a cutting edge 

of the rotating blade (9) is detected incrementally, stored and added 

to the preset withdrawal length of the following packaging means 
portion. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that on an 
interruption of the feed of the packaging means band (1), a running-on 

of the packaging means band (1) is detected incrementally as actual 
value at the one, preferably driven withdrawal roller (4') of the 

withdrawal roller pair (4, 4') and compared with an incremental value 
of the withdrawal roller (4') at the instant of the severing of the 

preceding packaging means portion as target value in order, within the 
same machine cycle and by retraction of the packaging means band (1), 

to bring this into a defined starting position behind the blade edge so 
that a packaging means portion of the preset withdrawal length is 

severed in the next following machine cycle. 
Method according to at least one of the preceding claims 
1 to 4, characterised thereby, that during a running-up machine cycle, 

a drive rotational speed of the withdrawal roller pair (4, 4') is 
increased for a short time above a target rotational speed (v
soll

which corresponds to the preset withdrawal length, of the withdrawal 

rollers (4, 4'). 
Method according to at least one of the preceding claims 1 to 5,

sensor as actual value on the packaging means band (1) and the drive 
rotational speed of the withdrawal roller pair (4, 4') is varied in 

dependence on the centred target position of the printed image.
