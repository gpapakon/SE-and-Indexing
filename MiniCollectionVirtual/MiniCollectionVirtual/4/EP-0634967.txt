<ABSTRACT>
In a process and device for operating a drier for powdered, granulated and pourable materials, a stream of dry air is introduced into the base region of a hopper-like drier and rises through the material to be dried, thus removing moisture from it. To reduce the cost of preparing the stream of dry air, according to the invention the stream of dry air is obtained from the outlet of a blow-moulding, stretch blow forming or other plastic moulding process.

Method of operating a dryer (20) for powdered,
granulated and pourable materials, there being led into the

base region of a hopper-shaped dryer (20) a dry air stream
which rises upwards through the material to be dried and

removes moisture from same, 
characterised in that
 the dry
air stream is obtained at the exit of hollow blow-moulding

process, a stretch blow-moulding process or some other
plastics moulding process, the scavenging air of the hollow

blow-moulding process proceeding from the blow tube (17)
being led to a heating device (2.4) and subsequently to the

dryer (20).
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
scavenging air (18) of the hollow blow-moulding process is

used as a dry air stream.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that

the scavenging air (18) of the hollow blow-moulding process
is pre-heated once it has left the hollow blow-moulding

process.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised
in that
 the drying air infiltrates the dryer (20) in a
continuous operation.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised
in that
 the drying air, once it has passed through the
dryer (20) is led back, at least partially.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised
in that
 in a first method step, before the hollow
blow-moulding process begins, the material is first dried in

the dryer (20) and then in a second method step the dried 
material is led into the hollow blow-moulding process, in a

third method step the material is shaped in the hollow
blow-moulding process and in a fourth method step, the

scavenging air arising during the hollow blow-moulding
process is led back into the dryer (20) in order to dry

additional material.
Device for drying powdered, granulated and pourable
materials, which includes a hopper-shaped dryer (20) in

which the materials to be dried are disposed and have a
drying air stream passed through them, the dried materials

subsequently being led into a hollow blow-moulding process,

characterised in that
, starting from the blow tube (17), a
pipeline (1.5) with the scavenging air from the hollow

blow-moulding process is led to a heating device (2.4) whose
exit pipeline (1.6) is led into the dryer (20).
Device according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the
dry air stream is blown in via an outlet aperture disposed

in the base region of the dryer (20) and under a pressure
which is slightly above atmospheric pressure.
Device according to one of claims 7 or 8, 
characterised
in that
 there is associated with the drying hopper (3.1) a
heating circuit, which consists of a pipeline (1.9) which

starts on the upper side of the dryer (20) for the
granulated material and opens out into the housing of the

drying hopper (3.1) upstream of a blower (3.2).
Device according to claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the
heating air led into the drying hopper (3.1) via a pipeline

(14) permeates an electrical device (3.3) and escapes via an
escape nozzle (1.10) in the base region of the dryer.
