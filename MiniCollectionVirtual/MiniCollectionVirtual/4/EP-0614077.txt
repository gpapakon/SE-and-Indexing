<ABSTRACT>
A flow cell apparatus for measuring particles 
suspended in a liquid comprises a sample liquid, supply 

device, a sheath liquid supply device, a flow cell which 
has a flow passage passing through a transparent 

measuring portion, and a nozzle for causing the sample 
liquid, from the supply device to flow in the flow 

passage of the flow cell. The nozzle has at least one 
discharge port which is disposed in the flow passage in a 

spaced relation from the inner wall of the flow cell flow 
passage. The sheath liquid supply device causes the 

sheath liquid to flow around the nozzle discharge port 
and surround the sample liquid flow to form a sheath 

flow. The flow passage of the flow cell and the nozzle 
are so formed as to ensure a sample liquid flow of a 

fixed width through the measuring portion. A stable 
sample flow having a fixed width can be formed in the 

measuring portion even when the flow is at a high 
velocity, and particles in the sample liquid can 

efficiently be photographed with high accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flow cell
apparatus for obtaining morphological information of
particles suspended in a liquid to analyze the information.A typical example of observing shapes of
particles contained in a liquid to classify and analyze
the particles is a urine sedimentation examination. The
urine sedimentum examination is a morphological examination
of particles in urine. Hitherto, employed for the
urine sedimentation examination is by a visual method of
dyeing sediment to make a specimen on a slide glass
plate and inspecting the specimen with a microscope.
The sediment contains particles of various sizes from
several micrometers, such as blood corpuscle cells and
bacilli, to hundreds of micrometers, such as columnar
particles. These particles are observed by switching
the magnification of the microscope between a high
magnification and a low magnification. According to the
foregoing method, typically, condensed urine in a
quantity corresponding to natural urine of 5 microliters
in a case of observation at a high magnification and or
in a quantity corresponding to natural urine of 750
microliters in a case of a low magnification is observed 
to count the number of each sediment component, though
the quantity of the sample to be observed varies
depending upon the purpose.These has been another method which utilizes a
flow cell having a flow passage of a specific form with
a measuring portion provided therein to classify and
analyze particles in a liquid. This method is what
forms, in the flow passage of a flow cell, a flow of the
liquid to be measured, which is surrounded by a sheath
flow, and measures particles in the sample liquid by an
optical means. Such a method is suitable to automate
the examination of particles in a liquid. For example,
National Publication of Unexamined Application No. 57-500995
has disclosed an apparatus in which a fluid
sample is introduced into a flow passage of a specific
shape and particles in the sample are photographed in a
wide imaging region. The apparatus has a CCD camera
connected to a microscope and a pulse light source for
periodically emitting light in synchronization with the
operation of the CCD camera, so that enlarged still
images of particles even flowing can be taken with the
CCD camera. Through analysis of the still images thus
obtained, the particles in a liquid can morphologically
be analyzed. Further, the concentration of the
particles may be analyzed by counting how many the
particles are contained in a volume of the photographed
sample.
