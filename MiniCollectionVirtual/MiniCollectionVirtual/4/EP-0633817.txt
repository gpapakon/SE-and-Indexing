<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for determining the carbon equivalent (C.E.) of structure modified cast iron melts, and to the use of this method for adjusting the composition of a structure modified cast iron melt. The method is based on the introduction of one or more pieces of iron of low carbon content into a sample container. The iron piece or pieces has/have a size such that the iron piece/pieces will not melt completely when the sample container is filled with melt, which is allowed to solidify. The temperature of the melt is recorded as the melt solidifies. When practicing the method, there is obtained a well-defined absolute temperature as the temperature passes the  gamma -phase liquidus line, or a temperature difference in relation to the eutectic temperature of structure modified cast iron of a closely similar type. The carbon equivalent is determined on the basis of a phase diagram applicable to this structure modified cast iron. The carbon equivalent of the melt is adjusted by adding carbon and/or silicon or iron of low carbon content.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of determining 
the carbon equivalent in structure modified cast iron, such 
as ductile and compacted graphite iron. The binary phase diagram between iron and carbon is of 
limited interest in the foundry industry as all materials 
which are used to produce cast iron always contain alloying 
elements such as silicone and manganese, together with 
impurities such as sulphur and phosphorous, which are able 
to change the phase relationships. Some of these elements 
can replace carbon in different proportions and therewith 
influence the phase diagram. As a result of the total effect 
of the substances on the phase diagram, the liquidus 
temperature found at a specific composition of the melt, 
referred to as the "carbon equivalent" or C.E., can be 
expressed as 
C.E. = % C + % Si/x + % P/y+...  
where x is considered to assume values between 3 and 4 and 
y is considered to assume values between 3 and 6. In the 
U.S.A., this equation is normally simplified to 
C.E. = % C + % Si/3  
and this equation is accordingly used below. This abbreviated formula can be used because the phosphorous 
content of those melts used within the foundry 
industry for treated cast iron is very low and therefore 
unimportant. The area of interest in the manufacture of 
compacted graphite iron and ductile iron fall within the 
range of C.E. = 3 to 5. The majority of published iron-carbon-silicone phase 
diagrams relate to those conditions under which gray cast  
 
iron solidifies, i.e. an untreated iron in which the 
graphite crystals grow in an extended and branched flaky 
form. In this system, a eutectic reaction between γ 
(austenite) iron and graphite flakes occurs at C.E. about 
4.35% and at a temperature of about 1155°C. Cast iron which 
has a carbon content or a C.E. < 4.35% is normally referred 
to as being hypo-eutectic, whereas materials which have a 
carbon content or a C.E. greater than 4.35% is referred to 
as being hyper-eutectic. As before mentioned, this 
definition is significant only with regard to flaky gray 
cast iron. It is possible to determine the physical C.E. value of 
hypo-eutectic cast iron by means of the phase change temperature. 
A cooling curve will show a temperature arrest 
when the sample temperature passes the liquidus line and γ 
phase begins to precipitate. The reason for this temperature 
arrest is because the growth kinetics of the 
austenite phase are very high and because the same also 
applies to the heat of crystallization of the γ phase. These

A method for determining the carbon equivalent of 
structure modified cast iron melts, in which a sample of 

the melt is taken in a sample container which is in thermal 
equilibrium with the melt, said sample container being 

provided with a centrally positioned temperature sensor, 
and in which the melt is allowed to solidify while recording 

temperature in relation to time, 
characterized
 in that 
the sample container is provided with one or more pieces of 

iron of low carbon content in contact with the iron melt; 
in that the iron piece or pieces has or have a size such 

that said piece or pieces will not melt completely during 
the solidification process nor affect to any great extent 

the average composition of the melt; in that the cooling is 
delayed at the iron pieces in relation to the cooling at 

the sample container wall; in that the temperature for the 
passage of the γ-phase liquidus line is recorded as an absolute 

temperature or as a temperature difference in relation 
to measured and calibrated values of the eutectic 

temperature for structure modified cast iron of a closely 
similar type; and in that the carbon equivalent is determined 

on the basis of a phase diagram applicable to the 
structure modified cast iron. 
The use of the method according to Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the carbon equivalent of a melt is 
determined and the carbon equivalent is adjusted when 

necessary, by adding carbon and/or silicone or iron of low 
carbon content to the melt.
