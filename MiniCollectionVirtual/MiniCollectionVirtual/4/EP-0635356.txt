<ABSTRACT>
An improved method for pressure-adhering tyre 
building component material is provided which 

includes the steps of: 

(1) adhering sidewalls (61) to a first cover (2); 
(2) cutting each of the sidewalls at a given 
portion thereof; 
(3) provisionally securing a joint portion defined 
by the cut ends of each of the sidewalls; 
(4) enfolding a bead portion with a bead edge of 
the sidewall and entirely pressure-adhering each 

sidewall to the first cover; and 
(5) pressure-adhering the joint portion 
provisionally secured with a machine, 

wherein the step (5) is carried out separately from 
a production line in which the steps (1) to (4) are 

carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the
manufacture of tyres for automobiles. More
particularly, it relates to a method for pressure-adhering
tyre building component material, and an
apparatus used therefor.In the manufacture of radial tyres for automobiles,
the tyre building process includes a first stage
wherein an inner liner and a ply carcass are wound
onto a cylindrical drum, a bead member is fixed to
each end of the ply carcass by bending the end of
the ply carcass to wrap up the bead member to build
a first cover, and sidewalls and the like are
adhered thereto, then follows a second stage wherein
the first cover is formed into a toroidal shape,
followed by adhering a breaker reinforcement layer,
a tread and the like onto the outer periphery of the
first cover.The present invention is directed to a method for
pressure-adhering edge portions of tyre building
component materials such as sidewalls in the first
stage of the tyre building process, and to an 
apparatus used therefor. More specifically, the
present invention is directed to such a method
capable of dispensing with the skill of a pressure-adhering
operator, eliminating the burden imposed on
the operator and reducing the operation time period
required for pressure-adhering joint portions of
tyre building material by the use of an apparatus
separate from the tyre building apparatus, and to
the apparatus used therefor.In the production process for rubber products such
as tyres and belts, in general, it is necessary to
join together rubber component materials some
reinforced with fibres, or the like such as carcass,
belt, sidewall, inner liner and bead. Joining steps
need to be performed quickly and assuredly for
improving the quality of the tyre or belt.Figs. 4 to 8 illustrate a conventional method of
pressure-adhering the joint portion of sidewalls in
a tyre building process. This conventional
pressure-adhering method is summarised in brief as
follows:
(1) adhering sidewalls to a first cover (refer to
fig.4); (2) cutting each sidewall automatically or manually
(refer to Fig. 5);(3) mating the cut end portions of each sidewall
with each other to form the joint portion
(refer to Fig. 6);(4) pressure-adhering the joint portion completely
with the use of a pressing roller or the like
(refer to Fig.7); and(5) enfolding the bead portion of each sidewall and
entirely pressure-adhering each sidewall to the
first cover (refer to Fig.8);After the above procedure has been completed, the
first cover is removed from the drum and then fed to
the

<CLAIMS>
A method for pressure-adhering tyre building
component material comprising the steps of:


(i) adhering sidewalls to a first cover
(2), said cover (2) including an inner liner, a ply

carcass, and a pair of bead members, one of said
bead members being affixed to each end of the ply

carcass by bending the end of the ply carcass to
wrap up each of said bead members;
(ii) cutting each of the sidewalls at a
given portion thereof;
(iii) provisionally securing a joint
portion defined by the cut ends of each of the

sidewalls;
(iv) enfolding a bead portion with a bead
edge of the sidewall and entirely pressure-adhering

each sidewall to the first cover;
(v) removing the first cover from a drum
upon which the steps (i) to (iv) were carried out

and
(vi) pressure-adhering from both inside
and outside the carcass the provisionally secured

joint portion with a machine;
 
wherein the step (vi) is carried out separately from

a production assembly in which steps (i) to (v) are

carried out.
An apparatus (1) for pressure-adhering a joint
portion of a tyre building component material,

characterised by a vertically movable table (11) for
receiving thereon a cylindrical first cover (2) with

its axis oriented vertically and in a state where a
joint portion of a component material is

provisionally secured and a vertically movable
roller means (5) having a means (6) for fixing the

first cover (2), rollers (41,42) for compressing the
first cover (2) and the provisionally secured joint

portion of the tyre building component material from
the inside and outside of the first cover (2), and a

means for causing the rollers (41,42) to move
vertically.
