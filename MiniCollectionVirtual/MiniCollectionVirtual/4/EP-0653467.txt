<CLAIMS>
An aqueous, cathodically depositable dipping lacquer, containing one or more
customary, self- or externally crosslinking binder vehicles which contain

cationic groups, and optionally containing one or more crosslinking agents,
pigments, extenders and/or customary lacquer additives, characterised in that it

contains 5 to 40 % by weight, with respect to the solids content, of coal particles
and/or of particles of carbon other than carbon black and graphite, which

particles have an average particle size of 300 to 10,000 nm and a specific gravity
less than 1.7 g/cm
3
.
An aqueous, cathodically depositable dipping lacquer according to claim 1,
characterised in that it has a ratio by weight of 0.05 : 1 to 0.8 : 1 of pigment,

extender and coal or carbon particles to binder vehicle solids and crosslinking
agent solids which are optionally present.
An aqueous, cathodically depositable dipping lacquer according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that it contains no further pigments and extenders in addition to

the coal and carbon particles.
An aqueous, cathodically depositable dipping lacquer according to any one of
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it contains, as carbon particles, particles

comprising carbon formed by the effect of heat on biological material.
An aqueous, cathodically depositable dipping lacquer according to claim 4,
characterised in that it contains particles of vegetable charcoal, animal charcoal

and/or activated charcoal.
An aqueous, cathodically depositable dipping lacquer according to any one of
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it contains hard coal particles as coal

particles. 
An aqueous, cathodically depositable dipping lacquer according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that it c
ontains, as a binder vehicle, a
basic resin which comprises primary, secondary and/or tertiary amino groups

corresponding to an amine number of 20 to 250 mg KOH/g which are partially
or completely neutralised, and which has a weight average molecular weight

(Mn) of 300 to 10,000.
An aqueous, cathodically depositable dipping lacquer according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that it contains 0.1 to 5 % by weight,

calculated as bismuth and with respect to the binder vehicle solids content, of
one or more bismuth compounds in the form of bismuthates, organic bismuth

complexes and/or bismuth salts of organic carboxylic acids.
A process for the cataphoretic coating of substrates having an electrically
conducting surface, characterised in that an aqueous dipping lacquer according

to any one of claims 1 to 8 is used.
Substrates comprising electrically insulating coatings, coated by the process
according to claim 9.
The use of the aqueous dipping lacquers according to any one of claims 1 to 8
for the production of electrically insulating coatings by electrophoretic coating.
The use of coal particles and/or of particles of carbon other than carbon black
and graphite, which particles have an average particle size of 300 to 10,000 nm

and a specific gravity less than 1.7 g/cm
3
, for improving the wrap-around of
aqueous, cataphoretically depositable dipping lacquers and for increasing the

corrosion protection due to the better wrap-around.
