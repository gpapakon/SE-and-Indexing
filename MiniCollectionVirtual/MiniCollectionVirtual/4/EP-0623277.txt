<ABSTRACT>
A crown-securing means for the connection of tree-crown parts to one another is given by a rope connection system (11) which comprises a rope (14) which may be provided with hose splices and, as a result of relatively loose braiding, can be widened to a multiple of its diameter by compression. The bandages (13) laid around the tree element (12) are fixed by hose splices (15). By means of corresponding expansion strips, they assume the desired flat form. The invention provides a jolt damper (17) which, by introducing a soft/resilient damper body into the interior of the rope, is integrated in the same.

<CLAIMS>
Rope linkage system, in which a rope (14) comprises a tubular braid
shortenable by compression and which thereby thickens and which is braided

from strands (18), during whose compression a free inner channel (20) is
formed, which is larger than the rope external diameter in the uncompressed

state and that the braiding is so loose that at least in the compressed
state between the strands (18) are formed meshes (22), which can be widened

at least to the size of the rope external diameter and at a random location
the rope can be shaped by tube splicing to form a loop, characterized in

that the loop as a tubular flat bandage (13) of adjustable size can be
shaped round a tree part (12), in whose vicinity an expanding band (25) is

inserted in the rope.
System according to claim 1, characterized in that in the compressed
state the inner channel (20) has a diameter, which is 1.5 to 2.5 times,

preferably twice the external diameter.
System according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the rope (14)
comprises several, preferably eight, double strands (18) with in each case

two juxtaposed single strands (18).
System according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the strands (18) comprise monofilament plastic threads or wires (18) with a

diameter of 0.1 mm or more and preferably the strands are weakly twisted.
System according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the rope (14) is made from a thermoplastic material, preferably polypropylene.
System according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the expanding band (25) is made from flat plastic material and its width

decreases towards its ends and optionally at its ends has gripping profilings
(27) and/or openings (28) and preferably in the vicinity of the

bandage (13) a protective sleeve (16) can be fitted onto the rope. 
System according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
onto at least one rope end (26) can be fitted an end piece (29), preferably

a shrink cap or a shrink tube portion.
System according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the tube splice (15) can be secured in the splicing area, where the rope

(14) is duplicated, by a collar (32), preferably a shrink tube.
System according to one of the preceding claims, characterized by at
least one jerking damper (17) to be integrated into the rope (14) and which

preferably has a damper body (23) insertable into the inner channel (20)
of the cable (14) and which preferably has a larger diameter than the rope

(14) and is preferably approximately 1.5 times the diameter, and/or an
elongated circular cylindrical shape, optionally tapering towards its ends

and preferably has a length of 10 to 40 times, preferably approximately 20
times its diameter and is optionally made from soft elastic material.
System according to one of the preceding claims, characterized by an
elastic tension element (40), which is fitted to the rope and/or an expanding

band (25) in the vicinity of a bandage (13) and, at least in the
unloaded state, the bandage (13) is pressed elastically onto the tree part

(12).
System according to one of the claims 6 to 10, characterized in that
the splice (15) has two splice longitudinal portions (51, 52), between which

a loop (50) of the rope portion forming the interior of the splice (15)
is passed out through a mesh (22) of the rope portion forming the exterior

of the splice and is drawn in again through the same or another mesh and
optionally the splice longitudinal portion (52) remote from the tree part

(12) is secured against pulling out.
Method for strengthening tree parts (12), such as branches or crown
parts, or for an interconnection by means of a rope linkage system according

to the preamble of claim 1, characterized in that around at least one tree
part (12) is shaped a loop with an inserted expanding band (25) formed into

a flat bandage (13) by means of a tube splice, the rope end (26) inserted in 
the inner channel (20
) of the rope (14) for tube splicing being provided
with an end piece (29) prior to insertion.
Use of a rope linkage system according to the preamble of claim 1 for
strengthening tree parts (12), such as branches or crown parts, or for the

interconnection thereof, where in the rope (14) provided with at least one
bandage (13) placed around a tree part (12) is integrated a jerking damper

(17) in the form of a damper body (23) made from soft elastic material and
insertable into the interior channel (20) of the rope (14) and where an

expanding band (25) is introduced in the vicinity of the bandage (13).
