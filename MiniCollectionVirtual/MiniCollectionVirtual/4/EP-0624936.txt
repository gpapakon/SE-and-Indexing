<ABSTRACT>
A joint connector for connecting a plurality of wires 
has terminals holding the respective wires, and a connector 

housing. The connector housing includes terminal receiving 
chambers for receiving the respective terminals, and a 

retainer. The retainer is abutted against the terminals to 
retain the terminals in their respective predetermined 

positions, the retainer having a retainer body and a joint 
member mounted on the retainer body for electrically short-circuiting 

the terminals which are desired to connect 
together.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a joint connector for
connecting a plurality of connection wires together.One known joint connector of the type described is
disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 61-277180.In the joint connector described in this publication,
front end portions of wires to which female terminals are
connected, respectively, are received in a connector housing
having a plurality of terminal receiving chambers. A
plurality of male terminals for being inserted respectively
into the female terminals provided respectively in the
terminal receiving chambers are provided in a housing body
for receiving the connector housing. The male terminals are
connected together in a manner corresponding to the female
terminals to be electrically connected together.In this construction, the female terminals are
connected respectively to the front end portions of the
connection wires to be connected together, and are received
respectively in the terminal receiving chambers of the
connector housing. And thereafter when this connector
housing is inserted into the housing body, the male terminals
in the housing are fitted in and connected to their mating
female terminals, respectively, so that the plurality of 
wires are electrically connected together through the male
terminals.In the above conventional joint connector, there has
been encountered a problem that the housing body separate
from the connector housing must be provided.The present invention has been made in view of the
above problem, and an object of the invention is to provide a
joint connector being fittingly connectable to another connector, and in which predetermined connection wires can
be connected together only by means of a connector housing.US-A-4 952 155 discloses a joint connector according to the preamble of claim 1.In order to achieve the above mentioned object, a
joint connector according to the present invention as defined in claim 1 for
connecting a plurality of wires and being fittingly connectable to another connector has terminals holding the
respective wires, and a connector housing. The connector
housing includes terminal receiving chambers for receiving
the respective terminals, and a retainer. The retainer is
abutted against the terminals to retain the terminals in
their respective predetermined positions, the retainer having
a retainer body and a joint member mounted on the retainer
body for electrically short-circuiting the terminals which
are desired to connect together.In the joint connector described above,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Joint connector for connecting a plurality of wires
(50) and being fittingly connectable to another connector,

comprising:

terminals (30) having a barrel portion (33) holding a
respective wire (50) and a terminal portion (32) being

connectable with a terminal of said other connector;
and

for electrically connecting said terminals (30) which 

are desired to be connected together; and
said contact terminals (63a) are inserted into the respective
open ends (31b) of said terminals (30).
Joint connector according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said retainer body comprises a plate and an abutment
wall (62) which is abutted against said open ends

(31b) of said terminals (30) and on which said joint
member (63) is mounted.
