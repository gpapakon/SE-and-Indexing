<ABSTRACT>
A control circuit (5) of a radar transponder produces 
pulses when the radar transponder detects a radio wave from 

a search radar. The pulses are sent to a sweep signal generator 
(13) in which sawtooth waves are obtained through a 

first constant current circuit (17) for linearizing the 
voltage-to-time characteristic in a falling portion of a 

sawtooth. The sweep signal generator (13) further has a 
second constant current circuit (22) for linearizing the 

voltage-to-time characteristic in a rising portion of a 
sawtooth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a radar 
transponder, and especially to a radar transponder used 
for search and rescue. Fig. 12 is a block diagram showing a conventional 
radar transponder for search and rescue. In FIG. 12, 
numeral 1 denotes a receiving antenna for receiving a 
signal from a search radar, numeral 2 denotes a field 
effect transistor (FET) amplifier connected to the 
receiving antenna 1, numeral 3 denotes a diode direct 
detector connected to the FET amplifier 2, numeral 4 
denotes a video amplifier connected to the diode direct 
detector 3, numeral 5 denotes a control circuit connected 
to the video amplifier 4, numeral 6 denotes a 
transmission gate circuit connected to the control 
circuit 5, numeral 7 denotes a sweep signal generator 
connected to the control circuit 5, numeral 8 denotes a 
microwave oscillator connected to both the transmission 
gate circuit 6 and the sweep signal generator 7, numeral 
9 denotes a transmitting antenna connected to the 
microwave oscillator 8. The antenna 1 receives a signal transmitted by a 
search radar. The signal is amplified by the FET  
 
amplifier 2 and detected by the diode direct detector 3. 
The detected signal from the diode direct detector 3 is 
amplified by the video amplifier 4 to a level necessary to 
trigger the control circuit 5. When the control circuit 5 
is triggered by the detected signal, it produces pulses 
indicating a transmission time and sends them to both the 
transmission gate circuit 6 and the sweep signal 
generator 7. The sweep signal generator 7 has the 
sawtooth wave generator 12 as, for example, shown in FIG. 
13. In response to a pulse from the control circuit 5, 
the sweep wave generator 7 outputs the predetermined 
required number of sawtooth wave signals to the microwave 
oscillator 8. A transmission gate pulse from the 
transmission gate circuit 6 is inputted to the microwave 
oscillator 8, and the oscillator 8 oscillates for time 
period corresponding to the gate pulse and performs a 
frequency sweep in a frequency range corresponding to 
voltage of sawtooth wave from sweep signal generator 12. 
A transmission signal from the microwave oscillator 8, 
which sweeps in the frequency range is radiated by the 
transmitting antenna 9 as a radio wave. The sawtooth wave generator 12 includes, at the 
output end, a parallel circuit constituted of a resistor 
10 and capacitor 11 as shown in Fig. 13. Therefore, 
a current discharged from the capacitor 11 through a 
resistor 10 is generally expressed by a
