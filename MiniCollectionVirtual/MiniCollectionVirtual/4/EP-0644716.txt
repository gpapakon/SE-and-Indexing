<DESCRIPTION>
 MEDICAL USES OF TRIOXOLANE AND DIPEROXIDE COMPOUNDSBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to trioxolane and diperoxide compounds. More particularly. it relates to formation of these compounds from unsaturated hydrocarbons and pharmaceutical preparations including these compounds for treating or preventing medical conditions. It also relates to methods of treating or preventing medical conditions using the trioxolane and diperoxide compounds.A trioxolane compound is herein defined as a compound of the general structure:wherein R and R' represent the same or different organic moieties. The indicated carbons may also have additional organic moiety branches.A diperoxide compound is herein defined as a compound of the general structure:O — O / \R— C C— R'\ / 0—0wherein R and R' represent the same or different organic moieties. The indicated carbons may also have additional organic moiety branches.Procedures for ozonating oil-soluble compounds are known in the art. being disclosed, for example, in U.S. patent No. 925,590 to Neel, U.S. Patent No. 2.083.572 to McKee, and U.S. Patent No. 4,451,480 to De Villez. However, not all ozonation reactions result in the production of trioxolane and diperoxide compounds. The production of such compounds from unsaturated hydrocarbons is disclosed in Murray et al., "Ozonolysis: Formation of Cross Diperoxides" and Criegee et al, "Fragmentation of Ozonides by Solvents," both in Ozone Reactions with Organic Compounds. Advances in Chemistry Series 112, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C. (1972). The disclosures of these two references are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference thereto. 

 Ozonation of olefins is generally recognized in terms of a mechanism postulated by Criegee, supra. This mechanism provides that ozone reacts with an unsaturated bond to form an initial, unstable primary ozonide (R— C— O3-C— R'). This primary ozonide readily decomposes to form a zwitterion and a carbonyl fragment. These fragments can then combine to give a trioxolane compound. Under other conditions, the zwitterion may dimerize to form a diperoxide derivative.The prior art discloses that some particular types of ozonated chemical compositions have certain pharmacological activities. However, as far as Applicants can ascertain, none of these compositions appear to have been prepared in a manner likely to result in the formation of substantial quantities of diperoxide or trioxolane compounds.In U.S. Patent No. 925,590, Neel discloses the use of ozonated
