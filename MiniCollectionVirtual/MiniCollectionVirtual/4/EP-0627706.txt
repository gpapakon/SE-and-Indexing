<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mobile electronic information transmitter with dependence on position and spatial direction, especially for information systems in exhibitions or for traffic information systems, optionally having partial units connected with cables, which has: a receiving unit for the identification code with a distinguished directional axis; a memory for the storage of an encoded audio-visual information; an acoustic sound reproduction unit which is connected to the output of the memory via a controlled sound mixing system; a central logical control unit which has its input connected to the output of the receiving unit for the identification code and which selects an encoded audio-visual information corresponding to the identification code input into the receiving unit for the identification code and is connected, via its outputs, to the inputs of the controlled sound mixing system and of the memory for controlling the mechanics, the output of the memory for controlling the mechanics being connected to the input of the memory; the receiving unit for the identification code having at least one identification code receiver (3) enabled for receiving a code transmitted via radio waves or infrared waves from an identification code transmitter (1), the identification code receiver (3) having connected to the inputs of its central logical control unit (4): the output of a compass (26) converting the specific angular direction of the horizontal projection of the distinguished directional axis into a corresponding electrical signal; and the output of an inclination angle detector (27), which converts the specific angle which the distinguished directional axis forms with the horizontal or the vertical into a corresponding electrical signal.
