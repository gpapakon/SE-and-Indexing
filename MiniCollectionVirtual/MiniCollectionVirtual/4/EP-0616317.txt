<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thin film magnetic
heads for a magnetic recording apparatus, such as an audio
visual apparatus, and a method of manufacturing the same,
and particularly, to a thin film magnetic head with
improved productivity, cost performance and tape running
characteristics, and a method of manufacturing the same.Hereinafter, description will be made of a
conventional method of manufacturing a thin film magnetic
head with reference to Figs. 9A to 9F and Fig. 10.In a conventional method of manufacturing a thin film
magnetic head, as shown in Fig. 9A, a layer to be a lower
magnetic core layer 22, which is made of a soft magnetic
thin film of Ni-Fe, Fe-Al-Si, Fe-Al-N, Co-Zr or the like
having high saturation magnetization characteristics, is
formed with a sputter method or the like on a wafer
substrate 21 of crystallized glass, Mn-Zn ferrite or the
like having excellent wear resistance. After patterning
this layer in a prescribed configuration to form lower
magnetic core layer 22, a magnetic gap 23 made of a 
mineral insulating layer of SiO2, Si3N4, Al2O3 or the like
is formed on lower magnetic core layer 22 with a sputter
method. A bias lead 30 and a magnetoresistive element
(hereinafter referred to as "an MR element") 31 are formed
and subjected to insulating coating. An upper magnetic
core layer 24 is then formed in a prescribed configuration
similarly to lower magnetic core layer 22, to form a
structure shown in Fig. 9A.As shown in Fig. 9B, a passivation film 25 of SiO2,
Si3N4, Al2O3 or the like is formed on an element portion on
the substrate excluding a wiring connection portion P with
a sputter method, a plasma CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition)
method or the like.Subsequently, a protruding portion of passivation
film 25 on element portion S is planarized by flattening
polishing (Fig. 9C). A Cr film is formed thereon as a
contact layer by vapor deposition or a sputter method, and
a protection plate 26 of Zn-ferrite, CaTiO3 or the like is
attached with an epoxy family adhesive or the like (Fig.
9D).Wafer substrate 21 on which a plurality of magnetic
heads are formed is then cut, and subjected to cylindrical
grinding and tape lapping, to form a magnetic tape sliding
surface B with a prescribed gap depth (Fig. 9E). A
flexible printed substrate 27 as a terminal wiring is 
connected to wiring connection portion P on substrate 21
by a known wire bonding method or a tape automatic bonding
method (hereinafter referred to as TAB), and covered with
a resin mold 28 (Fig. 9F).The thin film
