<ABSTRACT>
Compositions of, genetic constructions coding for, and methods for producing multivalent antigen-binding proteins are described and claimed. The methods include purification of compositions containing both monomeric and multivalent forms of single polypeptide chain molecules, and production of multivalent proteins from purified monomers. Production of multivalent proteins may occur by a concentration-dependent association of monomeric proteins, or by rearrangement of regions involving dissociation followed by reassociation of different regions. Bivalent proteins, including homobivalent and heterobivalent proteins, are made in the present invention. Genetic sequences coding for bivalent single-chain antigen-binding proteins are disclosed. Uses include all those appropriate for monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and fragments thereof, including use as a bispecific antigen-binding molecule.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with Government Support under SBIR Grant
5R44 GM 39662-03 awarded by the National Institutes of Health, National
Institute of General Medical Sciences. The Government has certain rights in
the invention.The present invention relates generally to the production of antigen-binding
molecules. More specifically, the invention relates to multivalent
forms of antigen-binding proteins. Compositions of, genetic constructions for,
methods of use, and methods for producing these multivalent antigen-binding
proteins are disclosed. Antibodies are proteins generated by the immune system to provide a
specific molecule capable of complexing with an invading molecule, termed
an antigen. Figure 14 shows the structure of a typical antibody molecule.
Natural antibodies have two identical antigen-binding sites, both of which are
specific to a particular antigen. The antibody molecule "recognizes" the
antigen by complexing its antigen-binding sites with areas of the antigen
termed epitopes. The epitopes fit into the conformational architecture of the
antigen-binding sites of the antibody, enabling the antibody to bind to the
antigen.The antibody molecule is composed of two identical heavy and two
identical light polypeptide chains, held together by interchain disulfide bonds
(see Fig. 14). The remainder of this discussion will refer only to one
light/heavy pair of chains, as each light/heavy pair is identical. Each
individual light and heavy chain folds into regions of approximately 110 amino
acids, assuming a conserved three-dimensional conformation. The light chain
comprises one variable region (termed VL) and one constant region (CL), while
the heavy chain comprises one variable region (VH) and three constant regions
(CH1, CH2 and CH3). Pairs of regions associate to form discrete structures as
shown in Figure 14. In particular, the light and heavy chain variable regions,
VL and VH, associate to form an "FV" area which contains the antigen-binding
site.The variable regions of both heavy and light chains show considerable
variability in structure and amino acid composition from one antibody
molecule to another, whereas the constant regions show little variability. The
term "variable" as used in this specification refers to the diverse nature of the
amino acid sequences of the antibody heavy and light chain variable regions.
Each antibody recognizes and binds antigen through the binding site defined
by the association of the heavy and light chain variable regions into an FV
area. The light-chain
