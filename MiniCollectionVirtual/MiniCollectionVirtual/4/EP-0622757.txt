<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a printing apparatus (10) comprising a printing 
track (20A) defining a print receiving surface and a printing carriage 

(21) arranged to travel along the printing track. The carriage includes 
printing heads (22) arranged to receive data from a central database 

(26) for printing on the printing surface at predetermined positions along 
the printing track, and a roller arrangement (46, 48) for driving the 

carriage along the printing track. An optical position encoder (52) is 

provided for monitoring the movement of the carriage as it travels along 
the printing track. A data transmission link (28) is provided for 

interfacing the central database to the carriage. The central database 
includes both positional data for controlling the position of the printing 

heads and pricing data. The printing track has mounting clips (188) for 
mounting it on a shelf edge, and the printing heads are arranged to label 

items of stock (18A) on the shelf (12). The invention extends to the 
printing track (20), the printing carriage (21), a shelf labelling system, as 

well as to a method of labelling a row of items of stock (18A, 18B, 18C).

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a printing apparatus, and in particular to a
printing apparatus for pricing stock items on supermarket shelves.Until recently, most items of stock sold in supermarkets were
individually labelled with price tags. This involved a shelf packer
affixing a price label to each stock item as the items were being placed
on the shelves during re-stocking. More recently, a bar coding system
has been introduced, in which packaging for a particular item range has
a bar code printed thereon identifying the particular item range. A
scanner at the check-out counter scans the bar code and a computer to
which the scanner is linked positively identifies the item and extracts the
price of the item from an on-board memory table.With the introduction of bar codes, the prices of stock items need to be
indicated in a discernible format. The current practice is to provide
labels which are held within labelling holders attached to the shelf on
which the items are standing. This gives rise to logistic difficulties, as
the shelf prices have to be kept identical to the prices on the computer
in the face of price changes occurring on a daily basis. The manual
replacement of pricing labels is a particularly time consuming and labour
intensive process. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a printing
apparatus comprising an elongate printing track including a print
receiving surface being integral with and fixed relative to the printing
track, guide means extending alongside the print receiving surface, a
printing carriage arranged to travel along the printing track on the guide
means, monitoring means for monitoring the movement of the carriage
as it travels along the printing track, and control means responsive to the
monitoring means for controlling the operation of the carriage, the
carriage including at least one printing head arranged to receive data for
printing directly on the print receiving surface at predetermined
positions along the printing track.In a preferred form of the invention, the printing apparatus includes a
central database remote from the carriage, the carriage includes memory
means, and data transmission means are provided for allowing data to
be downloaded from the central database to the memory means on the
carriage, the central database including both positional data for
controlling the position of the printing head on the printing track and
labelling data for printing labelling on the print receiving surface of the
printing track.In one form of the
