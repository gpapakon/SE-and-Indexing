<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for obtaining copolymers 
of tetrafluoroethylene with one or more perfluorinated monomers 

having ethylenic unsaturation, said copolymers having 
only carboxylic or carboxylate groups as unstable end 

groups, by polymerization in aqueous emulsion in the presence 
of a dispersing agent. The process is characterized in 

that CHF₂-CH₃ is used as chain transfer agent, and an inorganic 
peroxidic compound is used as initiator.

 
The carboxylic or carboxylate groups are successively transformed 

into stable groups of the -CF₂H type by known stabilizing 
treatments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 
tetrafluoroethylene copolymers with other perfluorinated 
monomers, having very high chemical and thermal stability. In the preparation of tetrafluoroethylene copolymers 
with other perfluorinated monomers by polymerization in 
aqueous emulsion, peroxidic initiators, chain transfer 
agents and dispersing agents are used. It is known that both the peroxidic initiator and the 
chain transfer agent give rise to the formation of unstable 
end groups in the polymeric chains. These unstable groups can cause problems during polymer 
processing, with subsequent formation of bubbles in articles 
or colouring of the same. Moreover phenomena of F- release 
from the handmade article (pipes, electronics components) 
can occur; for the applications where a high purity degree 
of the above copolymers is required, it is therefore necessary 
to reduce as much as possible the amount of the unstable 
end groups. It is known that by using an inorganic persulphate as 
initiator, unstable carboxylic end groups (-COOH) and/or  
 
carboxylate (-COO-) end groups are obtained. The chain transfer agent can give rise to different unstable 
end groups depending on its chemical nature. For 
instance, methanol forms unstable -COOCH3 and -CH2OH groups 
(see European patent application 457,255); methane gives 
unstable -CF2-CH3 groups (see European patent application 
220,910). Methane presents, on the other hand, the inconvenience 
that, in its industrial use, it is to be employed in 
high amounts, with consequent utilization of high partial 
pressures causing a lower polymerization rate, with decrease 
in plant productivity. The polymers with unstable end groups are to be submitted 
to different treatments in order to obtain stable end 
groups. At least one treatment with fluorine is generally 
carried out at high temperatures (commonly at 100-190°C). When unstable end groups of different types are obtained 
(for instance -COOH, -COOCH3 and -CH2OH), the stabilization 
treatment requires two subsequent stages, as described 
in the already cited European patent application 457,255. For the purposes of the present invention, a tetrafluoroethylene 
copolymer with other perfluorinated monomers 
is considered to be stable if an article obtained from such 
copolymers shows a low F- release (lower than 2 ppm) in a 
mixture of water with methanol and if the HF developed from  
 
the article, at high temperature, is low (lower than 50 
ppm), according to methods which are described
