<ABSTRACT>
The use is provided of an organic solvent comprising either a heterocyclic 
compound containing nitrogen or an acid amide compound for 

denitrogenating a light oil by extraction. The heterocylic compound may be 
a ketone or a pyridinium salt. Such a heterocyclic ketone may be a 

pyrrolidone compound, an imidazolidinone or a pyrimidinone. Any of such 
ketones may be substituted by an alkyl group. The acid amide which may 

form the organic solvent can be dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide or 
N,N-dimethylbenzamide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the denitrogenation 
of light oil by extraction. The term "light oil" means either an intermediate or a 
final product obtained from the process of petroleum refining. 
Light oil as an intermediate product usually contains about 1% 
by weight of sulfur compounds. Thesulfur compounds not only 
exert an adverse effect on the quality of petroleum products, 
but also form as a result of combustion sulfur oxides which 
cause environmental pollution. Light oil is, therefore, 
desulfurized to make a wide range of products including a 
cleanser, a fuel for a diesel engine, or burner, absorption 
oil, oil gas, and thermally or catalytically cracked gasoline. In addition, light oil contains nitrogen compounds in 
concentration of from about a hundred to several hundreds ppm. 
As the nitrogen compounds form as a result of combustion NOx 
which causes environmental pollution, it is desirable to 
remove said nitrogen compounds from light oil as much as 
possible. But the efficient denitrogenation of light oil has not 
been reported. US-A-3 197 400 discloses a process for refining mineral oil fractions to 
reduce their sulfur content by contacting the oil with a sweetening solvent of 
a dialkyl N-substituted aliphatic acid amide such as N,N-dimethylformamide. 
The use of such a solvent is also indicated to improve 
the colour of the oil. The use of such solvents is contrasted with the use of 
pyridine and piperidine in this reference which are indicated to be largely 
ineffective. Under these circumstances, it is an object of this 
invention to provide the use of certain organic solvents for 
denitrogenating  
  
 
light oil by extraction. It is further object of this 
invention to provide denitrogenated light oil. We, the inventors of this invention, have found that, 
while light oil contains aliphatic and aromatic sulfur 
compounds, it is mainly aromatic sulfur compounds that remain 
unremoved in a hydrodesulfurized product of light oil. We 
have, therefore, made an extensive scope of research work to 
explore a method of removing aromatic sulfur compounds from 
light oil, and found that extraction, which has hitherto not 
been employed for desulfurizing light oil, can desulfurize 
light oil easily and effectively, particularly if it is 
perfomed by using a specific kind of organic solvent and found 
that extraction with said specific solvent is effective also 
for denitrogenating light oil. Thus, the above object is essentially attained by the 
use of an organic solvent comprising either
