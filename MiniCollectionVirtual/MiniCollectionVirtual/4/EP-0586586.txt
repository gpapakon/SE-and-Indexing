<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a press apparatus for 
pressing a formed web. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a press apparatus which includes an 
extended nip press. In the prior art, TRI-NIP or Tri-Vent presses followed 
by a fourth smoothing press have resulted in newsprint and 
fine paper having improved sheet symmetry. Such symmetry is 
achieved primarily by pressing one surface of the web 
directly against a press roll and then subsequently 
smoothing the opposite side of the web during movement of 
the web through the smoothing press, which is the fourth 
press in the aforementioned TRI-NIP configuration. TRI-NIP 
is a registered trademark of Beloit Corporation, and 
Tri-Vent is a common law mark of Beloit Corporation. The dryness of the web produced on the aforementioned 
machines is within the range 30 to 43 percent solids at 
3126 meters per minute (4,000 feet per minute). Although an extended nip press is generally more 
expensive than a press including conventional roll couples, 
such is not necessarily the case when the cost of several 
spare rolls and ancillary equipment for the aforementioned 
TRI-NIP press is factored into costs. The cost of an 
extended nip press is, therefor, comparable and has the  
 
advantage that a sheet between 48 to 52 percent solids 
can be produced at 3126 meters per minute (4,000 feet 
per minute). More specifically, the TRI-NIP press or Tri-Vent 
press plus fourth press are relatively costly and 
are particularly labor intensive with regard to felt 
changes. US-A-4 880 502 describes a press drying 
apparatus including a further press nip downstream of an 
extended nip press. In EP-A-0 289 477 there is described a press 
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. More 
specifically, EP-A-0 289 477 discloses a press apparatus 
comprising an inverted extended nip press for pressing 
water from the formed web. The extended nip press 
includes a backing roll which defines a smooth 
peripheral surface such that the web extends around the 
backing roll so that one side of the web is in direct 
contact with the smooth surface. An elongate pressing 
member cooperates with the smooth surface for defining 
therebetween an extended pressing section for the 
passage therethrough of the web. Additionally, a bearing 
blanket slidably cooperates with the press member such 
that the web is disposed between the blanket and the 
backing roll during movement of the blanket and web 
through the pressing section. The backing roll is 
disposed beneath the
