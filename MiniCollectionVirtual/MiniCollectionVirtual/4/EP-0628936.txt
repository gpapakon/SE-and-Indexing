<ABSTRACT>
A marker (10) to be used in article surveillance systems of the type 
which employ alternating magnetic interrogating fields. The marker 

comprises a closed loop band of material having high magnetic 
permeability and low magnetic coercivity; and it has cutouts (12) 

distributed along its length to form thin strips (10a,10b) of the marker 
material to increase the effective length to cross section ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to markers or targets for
electronic article surveillance and more particularly
it concerns a novel magnetically saturable marker
characterized by a multidirectional sensitivity.United States Patents No. 3,820,103, No. 3,820,104 and
No. 3,665,449 describe magnetically saturable markers
for use in electromagnetic type surveillance systems.
These systems are generally used to reduce theft by
shoplifting but they are also used to detect the
unauthorized movement of articles in other
environments. The markers shown in these patents are
elongated strips of magnetically soft material having a
high magnetic permeability and a low magnetic
coercivity. When exposed to an alternating magnetic
field in an interrogation region, for example, the exit
from a store, these targets or markers become 
magnetically saturated in opposite directions during
each cycle of the alternating magnetic interrogation
field. As a result they disturb the field in a
characteristic manner to produce harmonics which can be
detected.These patents explain that the targets or markers
should have the configuration of an elongated open
strip with a high ratio of length to cross-sectional
area for maximum sensitivity to the interrogating
magnetic fields. When the ratio of length to the
square root of cross sectional are is below 150, the
magnetization reversal signal amplitude decreases
radically and becomes noticeably dependent on
orientation of the open strip within the magnetic
field. It is also suggested in these patents that the
open strip may have one or more major dimensions
satisfying this criteria.U.S. Patent No. 3,665,449 mentions the possibility of
using a disc shaped marker but indicates that because
of the low length to cross-section ratio such markers
do not produce very large or distinctive response
signals.U.S. Patent No. 4,074,249 describes a crescent shaped
target which is less sensitive to orientation than the
straight elongated open strip markers.U.S. Patent No. 4,075,618 describes thin elongated
markers which have enlarged flux concentrators at the
ends thereof to enable the markers to be shortened
without reduction in their sensitivity.
One problem that characterizes all prior art
magnetically saturable markers for electronic article
surveillance, is that the shape and size of the
available space on the object to be protected by the 
marker often will not accomodate a thin elongated strip. Compact disc recordings, for
example, have only a small ring shaped region araound a center opening that would
