<ABSTRACT>
In one embodiment this invention provides a process for preparing a dietary fatty acid calcium salt supplement composition which contains at least one additional nutrient ingredient such as methionine hydroxy analog. The dietary composition can function as a rumen bypass animal feed supplement, and permit a beneficial increase in the nutrient fat content of the feed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject matter of the present patent
application is related to that disclosed in patent
application S.N. (Docket D11691), filed
      , 1991.Conventional cattle feeds such as corn and
alfalfa often fail to provide sufficient energy for
cattle, especially lactating dairy cattle during
periods of heavy milk production. Feed containing a
high proportion of corn also has a tendency to
depress the milk fat content of the milk produced by
such cattle. Fat is a concentrated energy source,
and it is known that if the proportion of fat in
cattle feed is increased, lactating dairy cattle
produce high milk yields without draining their
reserves of body fat and without diminishing the
proportion of milk fat in the milk produced.However, it has been found that if the
proportion of fat in the diet of cattle exceeds
about 5% of the total feed in solids, the feed has
toxic effects upon the microorganisms in the rumen
of the cattle. It appears that fat reduces the
growth rate or even kills certain microorganisms
which digest fiber in the cow's rumen, thereby 
lowering fiber digestibility. This deleterious
effect on the cow's rumen is particularly true of
unsaturated fats. Although the decreased fiber
digestion in the rumen is partially compensated by
greater fiber digestion in the lower parts of the
alimentary canal, the total energy derived is less
than that resulting from more complete microbial
digestion in the rumen.There has been a continuing need for new
dietary supplements for animal feed which can be fed
to ruminant animals without interfering with the
rumen microorganisms, or being rendered ineffective
by the rumen microorganisms.United States Patent Numbers 4,642,317;
4,826,694; 4,853,233; and 4,909,138 describe the
incorporation of insoluble fatty acid salts in
ruminant feed as a means of increasing the fat
content of the feed without deleteriously affecting
the ruminant digestion cycle. A feed additive such
as fatty acid calcium salt functions as a rumen
inert product which passes through the rumen without
interfering with rumen fermentation (i.e., a rumen
bypass product), and is subsequently metabolized in
the abomasum or small intestine of the ruminant.Accordingly, it is an object of the
invention to provide a fatty acid salt composition
which can function as a rumen bypass animal feed
supplement, and permit a beneficial increase in the
dietary fat content of the feed. It is another object of this invention to
provide a process for production of a fatty acid
salt dietary supplement composition which
