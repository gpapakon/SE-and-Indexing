Flow regulating valve for water fitments,
especially rotary valve, having a valve spindle (11) which

is rotatably mounted in the valve housing (1) and is
connected to the valve closure member, a rotary knob (3)

for valve actuation being arranged on the end region of the
valve spindle (11) projecting out of the valve housing (1),

and a stop means, releasable by means of radial deflection,
being formed to limit the opening rotary movement of the

rotary knob (3), characterized in that a separate stop
housing (2) is provided so as to be non-rotatable with

respect to the valve housing (1), a rotational stop (21)
releasable by the user by means of radial deflection being

non-rotatably arranged in the stop housing (2) in the
region of the inside wall of the stop housing (2), and the

rotary knob (3) engaging by a stop lug (31) the rotational
stop (21).
Flow regulating valve according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the stop housing (2) and the rotary knob

(3) bear against each other axially with at least one circular
surface (22, 32), the rotary knob (3) being arranged

to be displaceable axially to a limited extent on the valve
spindle (11) and being pressed axially against the stop

housing (2) by a spring (340) supported on the valve spindle
(11), so that the rotary knob (3) bears without a gap

against the stop housing (2).
Flow regulating valve according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that in the stop housing (2) the rotational

stop (21) is pressed radially against the inside wall by
a spring (23) and is non-rotatably held by an actuating

button (210) led through a radial opening (24), so that by
pressing in the actuating button (210), against the force 

of the spring (23), the rotational stop (21) undergoes a
corresponding deflection and frees the rotation path for

the stop lug (31) as far as the fully opened valve
position.
Flow regulating valve according to one of Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the stop housing is non-rotatably

secured to the valve housing (1).
Flow regulating valve according to one of Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the valve housing (1) is

arranged in a fitment body (4) so as to protrude, the stop
housing (2) being secured coaxially with the protruding

valve housing (1) on the end face of the fitment body (4)
and the valve housing (1) projecting into the stop housing

(2) through a bore (26).
Flow regulating valve according to Claim 5,
characterized in that on the end face of the stop housing

(2) one or more protruding pins (25) are formed which in
the inserted position engage in corresponding bores (41) in

the fitment body (4) and secure the stop housing against
rotation, the stop housing (2) being held in its position

by a tubular nut (15) rotatable on a thread (14) of the
valve housing (1).
Flow regulating valve according to one of Claims
1 to 6, characterized in that the stop housing (2) is in

the form of a sleeve approximately symmetrical in rotation.
Flow regulating valve according to one of Claims
1 to 7, characterized in that the rotary knob (3) or a

region of the rotary knob with the stop lug (31) can be
arranged non-rotatably on the valve spindle (11) in

different continuously variable or finely graduated
rotational positions so that the- radially deflectable

rotational stop (21) is adjustable with respect to the
degree of opening of the flow regulating valve.
Flow regulating valve according to Claim 8, characterized
in that the rotary knob (3) is held by means of

a fine groove toothing (16) on the valve spindle (1) so as 
to be fixed in rotation and axially displaceable.
Flow regulating valve according to one of Claims
1 to 9, characterized in that the rotational stop (21) has

on the opposite side from the stop surface (211) a slanted
lateral surface (212) which is so arranged and formed that,

on rotation of the rotary knob (3) back from the fully
opened valve position to the closed position, the rotational

stop (21), by way of the slanted lateral surface (212),
is correspondingly deflected radially by the stop lug (31)

for free passage of the latter and thus the rotational stop
(21) is effective only in the opening direction of

rotation.
Flow regulating valve according to one of Claims
1 to 10, characterized in that the stop surface (310) of

the stop lug (31) is arranged tangentially to the central
axis (35) in such a way that, in the case of forceful actuation

of the rotary knob (3), shortly before the releasable
stop arrangement is destroyed the rotational stop (21) is

automatically deflected radially and frees the rotation
path.
Flow regulating valve according to one of Claims
1 to 11, characterized in that the rotational stop (21) is

made in one piece with the actuating button (210).
Flow regulating valve according to one of Claims
1 to 12, characterized in that the tubular nut (15) limits

with its outer surface the depth of penetration of the

actuating button (210) in the stop housing (2).
