<ABSTRACT>
An intelligent opto-bus including an optical/electrical 
connector (11) with a display (50). An array (40) of 

photonic components is mounted on a base (25) and coupled to 
external electrical connections (30) of the base. 

Electronics (35) are mounted on the base and coupled to the 
array for sensing the operation of the array and the status 

of optical signals supplied to optical ports of the array. 
The display (50) is coupled to the electronics to provide a 

visual indication of the operation of the array and the 
status of optical signals supplied to the optical ports of 

the array. The base is molded with a well (130) and grooves 
(132). The electronics and display are positioned in the 

well and the grooves form optical waveguides that 
communicate with a fiber ribbon (147).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to optical
connecting systems for information buses, and more particularly,
to a novel method of displaying the status of a bus and
information passing through the bus.Generally, optical connecting systems are utilized to couple
information that has been transduced from electrical
signals to optical signals in a transmitter, and from
optical signals to electrical signals in a receiver.
Therefore, they can be useful in connecting many different
types of complex electronic based systems or environments.
Typically, there is a source or transmitter to send and a
receiver to collect the signals. Optical connecting systems are
useful for isolating electrical interference from ground
planes. For example, optical connectors are not effected
by skin effects and switching noise. Also, signal
integrity and clock skew are improved with optical
connectors. In addition, optical connecting systems provide
access to wide operational bandwidths that allow increased
information transfer. Optical connecting systems are important in
connecting many optical fibers spatially positioned in
linear arrays, hereafter referred to as opto-links. In complex electronic based systems, specifically,
information opto-links that require more than one computer
processor to communicate with other computer processors,
it is important that the connecting systems are correctly
connected so that the opto-links are transferring the
desired information. However, one drawback with such
complex electronic based systems is that an incorrectly
mated connecting system could render the whole system inoperable,
or worse unreliable. Down-time in such systems is a
costly penalty that must be reduced and furthermore,
maintenance of such complex systems is expensive.Complex electronic based systems that have utilized
optical connectors in the past have also suffered from an
inadequacy of controlling and manipulating information
between the transmitter and the receiver. Information
lost during a communication between the transmitter and
the receiver can again render the complex electronic based
system inoperable, inaccurate and unreliable. Valuable
time lost during a faulty transmission of information is
expensive and reduces efficiency in complex electronic
computations.Additionally, complex electronic based systems also
suffer from an unknown real-time or present status of
information transferred between the transmitter to the
receiver; however, without a knowledge of the present
status of the optical connecting
