<ABSTRACT>
Systems (20) for making thickness measurements in a thin film structure (11) 
using an incoherently or coherently coupled structured surface (16, 21). A system (20, 

20a) is used to measure the thickness of a thin film layer (14) of a thin film structure 
(11) is which polished and structured surfaces are coherently coupled together. Visible 

light used to measure the thickness of thin bonded wafers that have a ground upper 
surface (16), or infrared light is used to measure the thickness of thick silicon wafers 

(10) where one surface is ground, and the other is polished. Other systems (20a, 20b) 
use a structured surface (21) that is incoherently coupled to a thin film structure (11) in 

order to illuminate the thin film structure (11) at many angles. The systems (20, 20a, 
20b) produce interference fringes that are detected (25a) and recorded (28), and multi-spectral 

pattern matching is used in a computer (29) to compute film thickness based on 
scattering characteristics included in a library (30) of stored interference patterns.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to film thickness measurement systems, 
and more particularly, to film thickness measurement systems for use with structures 
containing a scattering surface. Prior art document EP-A-0545738 discloses a film thickness measuring system 
comprising a spectrally filtered light source for illumination of a wafer to produce of 
reflected beam, a detector system for detecting the reflected beam and a computer 
coupled to the detector system that comprises a library of models corresponding to 
reflective patterns. Further, EP-A-0493827 relates to an optical system for wafer 
thickness measurement. In the fabrication of simple silicon wafers and bonded silicon wafers, there is a 
requirement to measure layer thicknesses at an early stage during manufacture when 
only one side of the wafer is polished, in the case of a single wafer, or when the top 
surface of a bonded wafer is mechanically polished to a level where plasma polishing 
can start. Bonded silicon wafers may be measured using the visible region of the 
optical spectrum since the silicon layers are thin, whereas thick single wafers must be 
measured using the infrared region of the optical spectrum due to high light absorption 
levels at visible wavelengths. If a thin film silicon wafer is illuminated with narrow band radiation, optical 
fringes are formed across the aperture, although they have reduced finesse or contrast 
due to avenging effects introduced by an exposed scattering surface (the top, fine 
ground scattering surface). The coupling between the structured layer and the remaining 
thin films is usually coherent in this case since film thicknesses are less than the 
coherence length of the light source. A thickness measurement may be made under 
these circumstances if a library used for pattern matching includes the effects of the 
scattering or surface structure details. In the simplest case of a ground surface that 
forms the outer or scattering surface, a model may be created based upon the random 
film thicknesses caused by the grinding process and the large range of angles, and 
hence optical path differences that occur in the layer.  
 Typically, scatterplates and scattering surfaces have been used in conventional 
interferometric and holographic measurements of mirror or object surfaces. However 
these conventional approaches measure the surface profile of the mirror and not the 
thickness of a thin film disposed on the surface of the mirror. Prior art exists for the 
case where structured
