<ABSTRACT>
A first puffer chamber (2) is formed by a puffer cylinder 
(11) having a substantially cylindrical flange portion 

and a shaft portion (1) and a fixedly disposed piston formed 
by an outwardly sealed cylinder to be accommodated in the 

flange portion of the puffer cylinder (11) at the circuit 
breaking position of the circuit breaking unit (4, 5). The 

internal space of the piston forms a second puffer chamber 
(10) communicating with the first puffer chamber (2). During 

separation of the circuit breaking unit (4, 5), gas accumulated 
in the second puffer chamber (10) is blown out toward 

between the electrodes, so that the effective interruptable 
arc time span can be prolonged without increasing the size of 

the circuit interrupting and operating units.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a puffer type gas
circuit breaker which is designed to compress SF6 gas in
a puffer cylinder, to blow out the compressed SF6 gas
toward a contact portion and to extinguish an arc
generating at the contact portion, and, in particular,
relates to a grounding switch gear device with an
improved circuit breaking unit which is suitable for
prolonging an interruptable arc time span.A conventional circuit breaker is designed to
open-circuit a grounded power transmission line at the
time of accident, in particular at a lightning damage, in
the power transmission line, and to interrupt the current
flowing therethrough. However, if the circuit opening
condition is maintained, interruption of the power supply
is kept continued so that to avoid such condition the
power transmission line is usually reclosed in about one
second, however, in case of a large electric power
transmission system because of a high transmission line
voltage and large electro static capacity between
transmission lines continuing time of a secondary arc is
prolonged due to an electro static induction from a sound 
phase after interrupting the failed phase such makes a
high speed reclosing operation in about one second
difficult, however which is desired in view of an
effective power transmission system operation. In order
to overcome the above problem through grounding the both
ends of the circuit opened failed phase by high speed
automatic grounding devices HSGS as illustrated in Fig.8,
the secondary arc A2 is extinguished, immediately
thereafter the high speed automatic grounding devices are
open-circuited and the interrupted failed phase is
reclosed, however, when a following accident is generated
during the circuit opening operation of the high speed
automatic grounding devices a zero missing current
condition in which the waveform of the AC current never
passes through zero level as illustrated in Fig.2 may
occur and such fault current in zero missing current
condition can not be interrupted by the conventional
circuit breaker.It usually takes time of about four cycles until the
zero missing current condition restores to a current
condition having an ordinary AC waveform. The time of
about four cycles corresponds to an arc extinguishing
time of such following accident which is determined by a
sum of a relaying time of two cycles from detection of
the following accident to generation of an interruption
command signal and an interrupting time of two cycles.
Accordingly, when it is required to interrupt a
