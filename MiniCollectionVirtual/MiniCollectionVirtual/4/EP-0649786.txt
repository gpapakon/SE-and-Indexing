<ABSTRACT>
A reefing system for furling around the boom, a mast-rail arrangement, a sail and a rig for use with this reefing system are disclosed which, even at minimum luff diameter, enable extremely high mainsheet stresses to be transmitted via the leech to the mast without the luff being unintentionally pulled out of the mast groove.   Furthermore, the novel system guarantees that the mainsail can be furled in the smallest space in a trouble-free manner.

A roller reefing boom system by which a mainsail is wound around a pivoted boom for 
reducing the sail area, the mainsail being guided along its luff in a slot of a mast, characterized 

in that
 
in the head area the main sail (1) is supported on the mast (2) via a tension transmitting 

mechanism (26), wherein the tension transmitting mechanism is a slide (26) guided along a 
mast track arrangement. 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 1, wherein the mast slot (20) is formed 
in an insert member (34) of the mast track arrangement (18) which, in turn, is fastened in a 

base track (30). 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 2, wherein the insert member (34) is 
supported in a dovetail fit of the base track (30). 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 3, wherein the slide bridges the insert 
member (34) transversely to its longitudingal extension and is supported on side faces (36) of 

the base member (30). 
A roller reefing boom system according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
slide (26) is supported on a roller bearing. 
A roller reefing boom system according to any one of the preceding claims, comprising 
a tensioning means by which a predetermined tension is applicable to the sail (1) during reefing 

and unrolling of the sail. 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 6, wherein during reefing the 
tensioning means acts on the main halyard and/or during unrolling of the sail acts on the 

mandrel (14). 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 7, characterized by a halyard drum 
(60) for the main halyard which is driven by a motor (66) and a gear unit (62), during the 

reefing operation the motor (66) acting as a brake through which the tension can be applied.  
 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 7 or 8, characterized by a drive unit 
comprising a motor (50) through which the mandrel (14) can be driven for reefing the sail (1), 

the motor (50) acting as a brake during unrolling of the sail (1). 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the gear 

unit (62) is a planetary gear unit. 
A roller reefing boom system according to any one of the preceding claims, comprising 
a support means (10) by which the boom is maintained at approximately right angles with 

respect to the longitudinal axis of the mast during the reefing operation. 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 11, wherein the angle () is 89.7°. 
A roller reefing boom system according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the sail is a full-batten sail and each batten section is formed by a group of 

battens (28a, b, c) which are arranged at a small distance from each other. 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 13, wherein a group of three battens is 
constituted by three round battens (28a, b, c). 
A roller reefing boom system according to any one of the claims 13 or 14, 
characterized in that the luff (27) of the sail (1) is a plastic profile (72) in the form of a 

boltrope. 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 15, characterized in that the plastic 
profile (72) is manufactured of polyurethane by the extrusion molding method. 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 15 or 16, characterized in that the 
plastic profile has a Shore hardness within the range of 40 to 100, preferably 90. 
A roller reefing boom system according to any one of the claims 15 to 17, characterized 
in that a webbing (78) is provided in or at a luff tape (76) adjacent to a cylindrical portion of 

the plastic profile (72).  
 
A roller reefing boom system according to claim 18, characterized in that the sail (1) is 
connected to the plastic profile (72) along the luff tape (76) by a zig-zag seam. 
A roller reefing boom system according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the mast (2) has a pretension for producing a mast bend (B) which 

corresponds at its deepest point to about 0.5 to 5 %, preferably 1 %, of the luff length (P) of 
the sail (1). 
A mast track arrangement for a roller reefing boom system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized by a base track (30) in which an insert member (34) including a 

mast slot (20) for receiving the mainsail luff (27) is fastened and comprising a tension 
transmitting means in the form of a slide (26) which is supported on the mast track 

arrangement (18) and is connected to the mainsail (1) in the head area.
