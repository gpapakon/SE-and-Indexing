<ABSTRACT>
Off-resonance magnetisation transfer RF-pulses (54, 64) are used in 
magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to suppress the signal of various tissues, such 

as brain tissue. Often, the signal of blood is also suppressed. Application of a magnetic 
gradient (55, 65, 85) during the magnetisation transfer RF-pulse (54, 64) increases the 

magnetisation frequency offset (86) in one direction and decrease the offset in the 
opposite direction. This results in a smaller signal reduction of the blood flowing from 

the one direction and a saturation of the blood flowing from the other direction. Both 
time and RF-power needed for a separate presaturation pulse can now be used for the 

magnetisation transfer RF-pulse.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device and a method for magnetic resonance
imaging. Especially, the invention relates to a device and a method in which use is
made of the transfer of magnetisation between free and bound protons to enhance the
contrast between different types of tissues and fluids in a body.Such a method is known from Article "Magnetisation transfer time-of-flight
magnetic resonance angiography", by G. B. Pike et al. in Magn. Reson. Med.,
Vol. 25, 372-379. In the method described the RF-excitation pulse is preceded by a
magnetisation transfer contrast (MTC) RF-pulse. Such a method for contrast
enhancement of blood has several problems. Firstly, as magnetisation transfer contrast
(MTC) is based on the suppression of magnetic resonance signals whereby the rate of
suppression varies for different types of tissues and blood, in general the magnetic
signal from blood is reduced as well. Secondly, the MTC RF-pulse precedes the
excitation RF-pulse by 10 to 15 milliseconds, the total repetition time of a data
acquisition sequence is increased by this amount which results in a slower overall data
acquisition. And thirdly, the MTC RF-pulse contributes to the total amount of RF
energy deposited in the person or animal to be imaged. This limits the RF power that
can be used in the MTC RF-pulse or that can be used in other pulses in the sequence.It is, inter alia, an object of the present invention to provide a device and
a method for magnetic resonance imaging in which the signal of flowing blood is less
reduced.To achieve this object, a magnetic resonance device according to the 
invention comprises an area for locating an object to be imaged;
a magnet system for generating a substantially homogeneous and stationary
magnetic field in at least part of the area;a gradient magnet system comprising gradient coils for switching on and off
magnetic field gradient pulses in the area, superimposed on said stationary magnetic
field;a radio-frequency (RF) transmitter system for generating and transmitting RF-pulses
to the object; control means for controlling the switching and size of the RF-pulses and
magnetic field gradients such that by the combination of generated RF-pulses and
magnetic field gradient pulses position dependent magnetic resonance signals are
generated in the object;a detector and reconstruction system for acquisition of position dependent
magnetic resonance signals generated in the object and for image-construction, the
image representing the internal structure of the object;the control means
