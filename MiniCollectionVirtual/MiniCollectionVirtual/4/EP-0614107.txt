<ABSTRACT>
A gray scale LCD cell device (116) combines a 
liquid crystal cell (80) having a symmetrical director 

field (82, 82') with a negative birefringence compensator 
plate (110) and interposes them between a pair of linear 

polarizers (112, 114). The symmetrical director field 
produces a symmetrical but nonuniform gray scale or color 

viewing circle curve (100) from the liquid crystal cell. 
The negative birefringence plate restores the gray scale 

or color viewing angle uniformity. When graphed on a 
polar plot, the measured light transmission percentage 

curves (120, 122, 124) characterizing the LCD are 
substantially concentric circles surrounding the optical 

axis (18) for all azimuthal angles (28) and viewing angles 
(24) up to 30 degrees. Adding colored filters (152) to a 

color cell triad (150) provides a basis for a multi-color 
display having uniformly perceived colors over a wide 

range of azimuthal and viewing angles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid crystal
displays ("LCDs") and more particularly to an apparatus
and a method for providing a gray scale LCD in which
intermediate transmission levels are uniformly perceived
across a wide viewing angle.There are previously known apparatus and methods
for improving the viewing angle of a "bi-level" LCD. An
LCD is referred to as bi-level if it is switchable between
a substantially light-transmissive state and a
substantially opaque state, whereas a "gray scale" LCD has
additional intermediate light transmissive states.
Bi-level LCDs are commonly used in portable computer
displays, whereas the poor viewing angle of gray scale
LCDs has limited their use to small-screen devices such as
portable television receivers. Before gray scale LCDs can
be effectively used in large-screen television and color
computer applications, viewing angle improvements are
needed.A clearer understanding of viewing angle factors
follows with reference to Fig. 1. An LCD 10 having a
front surface 12 and a rear surface 14 is illuminated from
behind rear surface 14 by a light source 16. LCD 10 has a
viewing axis 18 that is shown as a dashed line normal to 
the center of front surface 12 of LCD 10. An observer's
eye located on viewing axis 18 at a position 20 views LCD
10 "on axis." If the observer's eye moves off axis to a
position 22, LCD 10 is viewed at a viewing angle 24 with
respect to viewing axis 18. LCD 10 can be viewed with a
constant viewing angle 24 anywhere around a viewing circle
26. Positions around viewing circle 26 are at an
azimuthal angle 28 relative to a reference point 30 on
viewing circle 26. As the observer views LCD 10 from
various viewing and azimuthal angles, the perceived light
may change in intensity, contrast ratio, or color. The
degree of change may not be acceptable depending on the
optical transmission characteristics of LCD 10 and the
application.Figs. 2A, 2B, and 2C show, for a prior art
twisted nematic LCD, light transmission percentage
variation around viewing circle 26 for on-axis and 30
degree viewing angles and respective 0, 36, and 100
percent on-axis transmission levels. An ideal LCD would
have light transmission percentage curves shown as
concentric circles surrounding viewing axis 18 for all
viewing angles. Figs. 2A and 2C show respective near
ideal light transmission curves 32 and 34 representing
respective 0 and 100 percent (bi-level) transmission
levels. However, Fig. 2B shows that for a 36 percent on-axis
light transmission circle 36, light transmission at
