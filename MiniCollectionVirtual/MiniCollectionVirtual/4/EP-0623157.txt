<ABSTRACT>
Blends of carbonate and monovinylidene aromatic copolymers containing selected low molecular weight halogenated epoxy compounds, in combination with tetrafluoroethylene polymers, are shown to have surprising combinations of impact and ignition resistance and be very suitable for electroplating applications. In general the selected epoxy compounds can be represented by formula (I) where, preferably, R is hydrogen; X is bromine; i is 2; L is 2,2-isopropyl; n is from 0 to 1. Polymer blends based on from 65 to 98 weight percent carbonate polymer, from 2 to 25 percent by weight monovinylidene aromatic copolymer, preferably rubber modified, and from 0 to 10 percent by weight of a rubbery core/shell graft copolymer impact modifier are suitable for preparation of these compositions. It has been found desirable to employ from 1 to 20 percent by weight low molecular weight halogenated epoxy compound, and from 0.01 to 2 percent by weight of a tetrafluoroethylene polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an impact resistant and ignition resistant 
composition based on a major portion of a carbonate polymer, a minor portion of a 
monovinylidene aromatic copolymer, and an optional amount of a rubbery core/shell graft 
copolymer impact modifier. Preferably the monovinylidene aromatic copolymer contains a 
reinforcing rubber material, which rubber-reinforced copolymers are often referred to as ABS 
or ABS-type resins. It is well known that blends of a carbonate polymer and a monovinylidene 
aromatic copolymer, such as an ABS-type resin, can be prepared possessing desirable 
combinations of physical properties. These thermoplastic polymer blends are suitable for the 
manufacture of molded parts wherein impact strength, rigidity, toughness, heat resistance, 
and excellent electrical properties are required. However, it is usually desired to incorporate 
sufficient ignition resisting additives in such blends to enable the resin blend compositions to 
obtain the V-0 rating (1.62 millimeter or 1/16 inch samples) or 5V rating (3.18 millimeter or 1/8 
inch samples) in the well known Underwriters Laboratory test referred to as UL 94. In this regard, however, it has unfortunately been found that there are various 
disadvantages or tradeoffs that are observed when attempting to incorporate sufficient 
amounts of many of the known ignition resisting additives. Often one or more of the ignition 
resistant additives is found to cause degradation of one of the polymeric components, 
especially the carbonate polymer. In addition, if large amounts of the additive are required, 
the desirable physical properties of the resin blend are diluted by the typically undesirable 
physical properties of the additive compound. Moreover, some additives have chemical 
characteristics and/or processing characteristics that result in poor performance of the resin 
blend or parts prepared from the resin blend across the broad range of applications and 
processing equi pment types wherein these types of resins can be employed. In US-A-4,879,329 it is taught that specified high molecular weight 
halogenated epoxy compounds can be used, in combination with an antimony compound, to  
 
make blends of carbonate and ABS-type polymers ignition resistant WO-A-91/13937 similarly 
discloses the use of halogenated epoxy compounds in combination with an optional antimony 
compound and without Teflon, to make blends of carbonate and ABS-type polymers ignition 
resistant. In US-A-4,810,739 (equivalent to EP-A-0,131,751)
