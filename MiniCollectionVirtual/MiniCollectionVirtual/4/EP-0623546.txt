<ABSTRACT>
Assignment of elevators to hall calls is performed 
directly as a function of one or more system performance 

parameters, all related to passenger waiting time. 
Said function is calculated as an objective 

(meaning object or goal) function dependent upon those 
system performance parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
An elevator dispatcher causes a particular 
elevator in a bank of elevator cars to be sent to a 
floor in response to a user pressing a hall button at 
that floor. Traditionally, a hall lantern will 
illuminate just prior to the opening of the car doors in 
order to inform the user as to which car will service 
his hall call. The dispatcher assigns a car to a hall call 
according to a variety of elevator system parameters. 
It is possible for values of these system parameters to 
change between the time the hall call is registered and 
the time the hall call is serviced. Therefore, the 
dispatcher may reassign the hall call to other cars many 
times before the hall call is serviced. The user does 
not notice the reassignment because the hall lantern is 
lit only after these multiple reassignments have 
occurred and just before the car arrives at the floor. According to a dispatching scheme called 
instantaneous car assignment (ICA), once a car has been 
assigned to a hall call, the assignment may not be 
changed. Unlike traditional elevator assignment 
techniques, ICA informs the user at the instant of first 
assignment (or shortly thereafter) as to which car will 
service his/her hall call. The benefit is that the user 
can be walking toward that particular car, of the bank  
 
of cars, which is going to serve him and be positioned 
and ready to enter that car when it arrives. A know-and-go 
time is the time from when a passenger knows 
which car is responding to his hall call to the time it 
takes him to go over to the car. Therefore, giving the 
user the opportunity to be in front of the car when it 
arrives requires that numerous reassignments of a hall 
call to different cars cannot take place. To the extent 
a dispatcher is spending time reassigning, the know-and-go 
time is used up. The reason for allowing multiple reassignments in 
the past was to obtain the best assignment; concern over 
an initial optimum assignment was minimized in the past 
because there would always be reassignments possible and 
therefore the opportunity to correct for an initial 
assignment that had become less than optimum in light of 
subsequent events such as new hall calls and car calls. 
Under ICA, however, because there is little or no time 
for reassignments, the importance of a good initial 
assignment is increased. The first uses of ICA were not as sensitive to 
this issue as they might have been. Relative System

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for assigning a hall call to an elevator 
car out of a group of elevator cars, comprising: 


a) providing a remaining response time associated 
with an elevator car and said hall call; and 
b) providing a predicted registration time 
associated with said elevator car and said hall call; 
 
characterized by 


c) providing an objective function in response to 
said remaining response time and predicted registration 

time; 
d) performing steps (a) through (c) for every 
elevator car available for assignment of said hall call; 
e) comparing said objective function for all 
elevator cars available for assignment to said hall call 

for producing a comparison result; 
f) assigning an elevator car to said hall call in 
response to said comparison result. 
The method of claim 1, further including providing 
said objective function in response to a maximum 

predicted registration time associated with said car and 
said hall call. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein a relative 
system response (RSR) quantity is included in said 

objective function. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein said remaining 
response time, and said predicted registration time, are 

combined linearly to perform said objective function. 
The method of any preceding claim, wherein said 
assignment is disallowed if said hall call has been 

previously assigned more than a limited number of times 
previously.  

 
The method of any preceding claim, wherein said 
assignment is disallowed if said hall call has been 

previously assigned more than a limited number of times 
previously and wherein the limit on the number of 

reassignments is excepted where: 

a) the predicted registration time of the 
elevator car presently assigned to said hall call is 

greater than the predicted registration time of an 
elevator car associated with the lowest value objective 

function by predicted registration time difference, or 
b) the elevator car assigned to said hall call is 
traveling away from the floor of said hall call. 
The method of any preceding claim, wherein said 
objective function is of the form: 


OBJ (
icar
) = A·RRT + B·¦PRT - T
1
¦ 
+ δ·C·[(maxPRT) - T
2
]
2
 + D·RSR 
where OBJ (
icar
) is the objective function; 
where RRT is the remaining response time; 
PRT is the predicted registration time; 
maxPRT is the maximum predicted registration time; 
T
1
 is a time value; 
T
2
 is another time value; 
RSR is a relative system response quantity; 
δ =

>

0 otherwise.
