<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel metal salts of (poly)citraconimide and 
(poly)itaconimide carboxylic acids, and a vulcanizable rubber 
composition comprising these metal salts and which, upon 
vulcanization, exhibits improved dynamic properties. More 
particularly, the invention also relates to a sulfur-vulcanized rubber 
composition which is vulcanized in the presence of particular 
anti-fatigue coagents, as well as to a sulfur-vulcanization process 
carried out in the presence of said coagents and the use of these 
coagents in the sulfur-vulcanization of rubber. In the tire and belt industries, among others, better mechanical and 
dynamic properties are being demanded. It has long been known that 
the physiomechanical and mechanical-dynamic properties of rubber can 
be improved by using a large amount of sulfur as a cross-linking 
agent. However, under service conditions or prolonged vulcanization, 
excess sulfur produces reversion which results in the shortening of 
crosslinks and a marked decrease in heat resistance and resistance to 
flex cracking, among other properties in the final product. One of these problems, the resistance to flex cracking, also known as 
fatigue resistance, is solved by the addition of a coagent in 
accordance with the present invention. In order to eliminate the foregoing disadvantage, it has been proposed 
to add saturated carboxylic acids and their metal salts to sulfur-vulcanization 
systems. One example of a publication relating to this 
subject is US-A-4,191,671. In comparative Example 8 and 
Examples 11-23 improvements in fatigue resistance are shown which are 
said to result from the addition of stearic acid and salts of stearic 
acid with zinc, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, sodium and cobalt, to a 
sulfur-vulcanization system. This patent also mentions the addition 
of unsaturated carboxylic acid salts to a combination peroxide/sulfur  
 
vulcanization system in order to improve the abrasion resistance of 
the rubber. EP-A-0 191 931 suggests that the use of a bismaleimide 
compound in combination with a sulfenamide and a 
dithiophosphoric acid leads to further improvements in the mechanical 
and anti-reversion properties of sulfur-vulcanized rubbers. The 
patent specification claims that these rubbers exhibit improved 
resistance to reversion, resistance to heat ageing and resistance to 
flex cracking. However, this system is limited to vulcanization 
carried out in the presence of a sulfenamide accelerator in 
combination with a dithiophosphoric acid accelerator
