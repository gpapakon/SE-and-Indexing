<ABSTRACT>
Method and adjusting device for varying the compression of an internal combustion engine with a cylinder receiving section (2) which is pivotably mounted in the crankcase section (4) of the engine supporting the crankshaft, about a tilting shaft bearing (8) on one side of the engine, to effect a variation in the engine compression. A tilting mechanism (70) acting between the crankcase section and the cylinder receiving section is arranged on the side of the engine opposite the tilting shaft bearing (8), enabling the distance between the two engine parts to be varied. A hydraulic adjusting device (76, 78) is connected to the tilting mechanism (70) for adjusting the lateral tilting of the cylinder receiving section (2) relative to the crankcase section (4). The adjusting device operates mainly without the supply of external driving force and uses hydraulic pressure energy stored in a pressure accumulator (96) which is charged with pressure energy derived from the compression and combustion in the engine cylinders and is transmitted to the accumulator (96) via the tilting mechanism (70) and the adjusting device (76, 78). The tilting mechanism comprises a mechanism which is rotatably mounted in the crankcase section (4) and whose variation in torsional position corresponds to the variation in the distance between the cylinder receiving section and the crankcase section. The torsional movement of the mechanism (56, 72) is used for varying the effective length of a hydraulic piston-cylinder arrangement (78) connected between the crankcase section (4) and the cylinder receiving section (2), the moving piston (82) of which arrangement divides the interior of the cylinder housing (80) into two variable chambers (92, 94), one (94) of which can be hydraulically connected to a reservoir (108) and the other (92) to the pressure accumulator (96).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an intemal combustion engine with a compression 
ration adjusting device of the type indicated in the preamble to patent claim 1 
and to method indicated in the preamble to patent claim 8 for adjusting the 
compression ratio of such an engine. An internal combustion engine, for example an in-line engine, of the type in 
question, has a cylinder receiving section (a cylinder block) which is pivotably 
connected to the crankshaft supporting crankcase section of the engine by a 
tilting shaft bearing arrangement connecting the parts on one side of the 
engine. The cylinder receiving section supports a cylinder head which forms 
the cylinder head of the engine. In the case of an engine with overhead 
camshafts, these are mounted in the cylinder head. On the side of the 
engine opposite the tilting shaft bearing arrangement there is a tilting 
mechanism arranged between the cylinder receiving section and the 
crankcase section, with which mechanism the cylinder receiving section and 
the cylinder head connected to it can be inclined laterally relative to the 
crankcase section by pivoting about the tilting shaft bearing arrangement. Because the cylinder receiving section can be inclined (tilted) laterally 
relative to the crankcase section, the distance between the crankshaft (with 
adhering pistons) and the cylinders will be variable. The volume of that part 
of the combustion chamber which is located above the upper limiting surface 
of the respective pistons, in the upper turning position of the piston (upper 
dead centre) can therefore be increased by lateral inclination of the cylinder 
receiving section relative to the crankcase section. This means that the 
compression ratio of the engine will be variable, enabling the efficiency of the 
engine to be optimised for varying driving loads, which results in improved 
engine performance. The tilting shaft bearing arrangement between the crankcase section and the 
cylinder receiving section is, as already mentioned, arranged on one side of 
the engine, whilst the mechanism with which the cylinder receiving section 
can be inclined relative to the crankcase section is arranged on the opposite 
side of the engine. The tilting shaft bearing arrangement suitably  
 
incorporates a lateral inclination shaft which runs parallel with the crankshaft 
and which is housed in axially separated bearing brackets which are rigidly 
connected to the crankcase section and are positioned in line with each 
other along the outside of the cylinder

cylinder housing into two variable chambers (92, 94), one (94) of which is

rotates relative to the crankcase section (4) and whose variation in torsional 
position is adjusted to correspond to the variation in the distance between 

the cylinder receiving section (2) and the crankcase section (4), enabling the

camshafts (38, 40) mounted in it, and is provided with bearing lugs (54)

reduction in the effective length of the arrangement, and consequently a 
contraction of the cylinder receiving section (2) and the crankcase section (4) 

due to the rotation of the mechanism (56, 72).
