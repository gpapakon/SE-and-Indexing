<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alumina sol 
coating fluid, particularly an alumina sol coating fluid 
for forming an ink-receiving layer of a recording sheet. In recent years, there have been many opportunities 
in which overhead projectors are employed instead of 
conventional slide projectors, for presentation at 
meetings of various academic societies or at various 
other meetings. Further, in the field of printing, 
transparent printed matters are required for various 
publications, packaging etc. In writing or printing on such transparent sheets, 
special caution or care is required particularly for the 
printing speed or drying, as compared with printing on 
usual paper sheets, since the transparent sheets lack in 
ink absorptivity. Also with opaque substrates, ink 
absorptivity is poor, and similar caution or care is 
required in many cases. On the other hand, it is reported, for example, in  
 
USP 5,104,730 that a recording sheet having an adsorbent 
layer of an alumina hydrate formed on a transparent non-absorptive 
substrate, is capable of solving above 
problems and thus suitable for use as a recording medium. 
This recording sheet comprises a transparent substrate 
such as a polyethylene terephthalate and a layer of a 
porous alumina hydrate, formed thereon, which absorbs and 
fixes mainly a colorant in ink. This porous alumina 
hydrate layer is formed by coating on the substrate a 
coating fluid comprising an alumina sol of boehmite 
crystal particles and a binder of polyvinyl alcohol type, 
followed by drying. However, the coating fluid comprising an alumina sol 
and a polyvinyl alcohol type binder is likely to undergo 
an increase of the viscosity. This problem can be 
reduced by selecting the binder with proper 
characteristics. However, when it has been attempted to 
obtain a coating layer having a particularly good 
absorptivity, it has been likely that fine cracks result 
during the drying operation. It is an object of the present invention to prevent 
formation of fine cracks during the drying operation in 
the process for producing an alumina coating layer having 
good absorptivity. Thus, the present invention provides an alumina sol 
coating fluid containing an alumina hydrate and a 
polyvinyl alcohol and having boric acid or a borate  
 
incorporated therein. Now, the present invention will be described in 
detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. In the present invention, the alumina hydrate may be 
any alumina hydrate so long as it is capable of forming a 
porous
