Device for treating flat parts (11) with regular geometry, comprising a
chamber (28) comprising side walls, a terminal wall (9), an opening in a front

plate (8) opposite said terminal wall, a support means for carrying a plurality of
parts (11), a means (15) for introducing treatment fluids, a means (6) for closing

said chamber (28), a means (14) for evacuating said fluids, so that they can treat
said parts (11) and then empty the chamber (28), characterized in that said means

for supporting the parts (11) is fast with the closure means (6) and is constituted
by two lateral combs (1) which are mounted to articulate on links (16, 17)

allowing them to be moved apart by tipping, in order to allow passage of said
parts (11) between the combs, then brought closer, in order that they abut beneath

said parts and maintain them in said chamber.
Device for treating flat parts (11) according to Claim 1, characterized in
that said lateral combs (1) are provided to be driven in rotation.
Treatment device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the drive
means of each of said combs (1) is constituted by a gear motor (24) outside said

chamber, fast with a magnetic coupling placed against said closure means (6) and
driving therethrough a plate supporting magnets (25) fixed to the end and in the

axis of said comb (1) when the latter is in tilted position for holding said parts
(11).
Treatment device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characteried in
that the closure means (6) of said chamber (28) is in sealed abutment against the

front plate (8) thanks to the compression of a gasket (27) enabling said chamber
to be placed under reduced pressure or overpressure.
Method of treating flat parts (11) with regular geometry, using the device
according to Claim 1 and comprising the following steps: 


bringing said flat parts (11) stored in their transport basket (2) beneath

said chamber (28) which is opened by moving the shell (7) constituting it away
from its closure means (6);
transferring said parts (11) by any transfer means (29) from the basket
(2) into the open volume of said chamber (28);
grasping said parts by tilting said two lateral combs (1) that were
previously moved apart, and which engage therebeneath so as to constitute said

support means for them, and said transfer means (29) is withdrawn;
closing said chamber (28) by moving said shell (7) around said parts (11)
and their supporting combs (1) until contact and seal against the closure means

(6);
performing all treatment by introducing fluids into the chamber thanks to
means (15) and at the end of treatments and after evacuation of the fluids by

means (14) and re-opening of the latter, said parts (11) are transferred back into
their transport basket (2).
Method of treating flat parts (11) of regular geometry according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the seal of the shell (7) against said closure means (6) is

ensured by any means independent thereof ensuring closure of said chamber (28)
by translation of said shell against said closure means.
Method of treatment according to either one of Claims 5 and 6, and for flat
parts (11) of circular shape, characterized in that, during said treatments by fluids,

said lateral support combs (1) are driven in rotation, so that said flat parts (11)
rotate on themselves at slow speed in said chamber (28).
Method of treatment according to any one of Claims 5 to 7, characterized
in that said fluids are projected by nebulizing strips (15) whose orifices lie in the

planes separating two contiguous parts (11). 
Method of treatment according to any one of Claims 5 to 8, characterized
in that said liquid fluids are introduced in the chamber (28) until the parts (11) are

completely immersed, making it possible to effect at least one sound-vibration
treatment thereof.
Method of treatment according to any one of Claims 5 to 9, characterized
in that, after any treatment by liquid fluids of said parts (11), said chamber (28) is

filled, up to total immersion of the parts (11) , with a hot liquid having a high
capacity for absorbing water, and said fluid is discharged at a speed at the most

equal to that balancing the capillarity tensions of this liquid on the surface of said
parts and allowing entrainment of the non-adhering particles to be eliminated.
