<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for restraining an occupant during a 
side impact of a vehicle with an object includes an air bag 

(20) mounted in a vehicle door (22) adjacent to the 
occupant. The door (22) includes an outside panel (26) and 

an inside panel (28) spaced from the outside panel (26). 
An accelerometer (50) for measuring sideways acceleration 

of the vehicle is mounted to the inside panel (28) of the 
door (22). The output signal of the accelerometer has a 

value functionally related to the acceleration of the 
vehicle in a direction substantially perpendicular to the 

side of the vehicle. A controller (54, 56, 62, 66) 
determines the sideways velocity from the accelerometer 

output signal and deploys the air bag (20) if the velocity 
exceeds a predetermined value within a predetermined time 

period. Reinforcement members (310, 312, 314) enhance 

communication of the sideways acceleration to the 
accelerometer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a vehicle occupant
restraint system and is particularly directed to a
method and apparatus for restraining an occupant during
a side impact of the vehicle.Vehicle occupant restraint systems having an actuatable
restraining dice are well known in the art. One
particular type of actuatable restraining device includes
an inflatable air bag mounted within the occupant compartment
of the vehicle in a forward location to protect
the occupant during a frontal crash.Such restraint systems for protecting an occupant
during a frontal crash further include a crash sensor for
detecting the occurrence of a vehicle frontal crash condition
and for providing an electrical signal indicative of
the frontal crash condition. Crash sensors in restraint
systems that protect the occupant during a fronts crash
condition include actuatable switches, inertia switches,
or accelerometers.When the crash sensor indicates that a frontal vehicle
crash condition is occurring, an electric current of
predetermined magnitude and duration is passed
through a squib, i.e., an electrically actuatable ignitor,
for the purpose of igniting the squib. The squib, when
ignited, ignites a combustible gas generating composition
and/or pierces a container of pressurized gas operatively
coupled to the air bag. Ignition of the squib, thus,
results in inflation of the air bag.Occupant restraint systems for protecting an occupant
during a side impact of the vehicle are also known
in the art. Such side impact restraint systems typically
include an air bag mounted in the vehicle door or arm
rest adjacent the occupant. One known side impact
occupant restraint system is disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,966,388 to Warner, et al. This '388 patent discloses
an air bag mounted in the vehicle door adjacent
the occupant. The side impact crash sensing device disclosed
in the '388 patent is a strip switch mounted to the
outside panel of the door. The strip switch is designed to
provide a crash indication when an object string the
side of the vehicle penetrates the outer door panel by
more than about one inch.Another known side impact restraint system is disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 5,072,966 to Nishitake, et al.
The restraint system of the '966 patent includes an air
bag mounted in the vehicle arm rest or inside the door.
Two side impact crash sensors are provided for each of
the air bag restraints. One of the side impact crash sensors
is mounted to a central portion of a door reinforcement
member located inside of the door, i.e.,

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for restraining an occupant of a vehicle during a side
impact of the vehicle with an object, said apparatus comprising:


deployable restraining means (20) mounted to be operative between the occupant
and a side assembly of the vehicle adjacent the occupant, said side assembly

having an outside panel (303) and an inside panel (302) spaced from said outside panel;
an accelerometer (306) for measuring sideways vehicle acceleration, said accelerometer
providing an output signal having a value functionally related to the sideways

acceleration of the vehicle;
monitoring means (54, 56) for monitoring said output signal of said accelerometer
(50);
determining means (56) for determining a vehicle velocity value in a sideways
direction from said monitored output signal of said accelerometer (306);
deployment means (56, 62, 66, 70, 71) for deploying said restraining means (20) if
said determined velocity value is indicative of the occurrence of a deployment crash

condition;
CHARACTERISED IN THAT
said accelerometer (306) is mounted to the inside panel (302) of said side assembly,
and further characterised in that
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said side assembly includes a vehicle
door (300) wherein said accelerometer is mounted to an inside panel of said door at a

lower, rearwardmost quadrant (II) of said door.
said inside panel (302) has

a recessed pocket (304), said accelerometer (306) being mounted in said recessed pocket (304).
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims wherein said inside panel
(302) includes reinforcement means (310, 312, 314) for enhancing communication of sideways

acceleration of said vehicle to said accelerometer (306). 
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims wherein said deployment
means (56, 62, 66, 70, 71) includes actuation means (56, 62, 66) for providing an actuation

signal only if the determined velocity exceeds a predetermined velocity limit within a
predetermined time period after a predetermined acceleration value is exceeded, deployment

of said restraining means (20) occurring only in response to said actuation signal.
The apparatus of claim 4 wherein said determining means (56) includes means
for integrating said output signal of said accelerometer and wherein said actuation means

(56, 62, 66) provides said actuation signal when the value of the integration exceeds a
predetermined integration limit within said predetermined time period.
The apparatus of claim 5 further includes means for resetting the value of the
integration to zero if said value of the integration does not exceed said predetermined

integration limit within said predetermined time period.
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims wherein said velocity is not
determined until the sensed acceleration of said side assembly exceeds a predetermined

acceleration limit.
