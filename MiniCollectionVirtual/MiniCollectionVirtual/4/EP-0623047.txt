<ABSTRACT>
When currents of smoke gas containing slight amounts of ammonia are purified, in particular after a nitrogen-removal process, care must be taken that this trace element is not discharged in the environment together with fly ash or with the water used for washing the smoke gas. In a known process, the washing water is sprayed into the smoke gas current upstream of the dry separator, after ammonia has been substantially discarded, and is evaporated therein, so that no waste water is discharged outside. The fly ash is subjected to an additional treatment to reduce the ammonium content so that the admissible limit values can be respected. A waste water-free process is disclosed, in which the ammonium content of the fly ash produced in the dry separator is so low that the fly ash can be recycled or disposed of without further treatment. For that purpose, the washing water from the washer is brought to a pH value ranging from 12 to 13 before it is sprayed into the smoke gas current and after it has been substantially rid of ammonia. This invention is particularly suitable for cleaning smoke gases of waste incineration plants.

<CLAIMS>
A process for cleaning a current of flue gas which is contaminated by ammonia, acid 
pollutant gases and flue dust, 


wherein the current of flue gas is conditioned in a spray drier by an aqueous liquid being 
sprayed in, is freed of ammonia and further contaminants, such as hydrochloric acid and 

hydrofluoric acid, at a second point situated downstream by dry separation of flue dust 
and at a third point situated further downstream by washing with an aqueous acid 

medium, 
and wherein washing liquid produced during the washing is drawn off, is freed of ammonia 
at least in part, and is then sprayed into the current of flue gas in the spray drier and is 

evaporated therein, 
characterized in that
 before being sprayed into the current of flue gas the drawn-off 
washing liquid is set to a pH value of from 12 to 13, at which it does not absorb ammonia 

from the gas phase. 
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pH value of the washing 
liquid is set by adding caustic soda solution.
