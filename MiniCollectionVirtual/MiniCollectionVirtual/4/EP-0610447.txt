<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of an antibody recognising the CDw52 antigen for the treatment of T-cell mediated inflammation of the joints, in particular for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Preferably the antibody is the humanised antibody CAMPATH-1H which may be used together with another immunosuppressive antibody or an immunosuppressive agent such as a steroid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of a
medicament for the treatment of certain auto-immune
conditions in a human or animal subject.The cells and molecules in an animal body do not
normally stimulate an adaptive immune response in that body
as a result of a number of mechanisms which ensure a state
referred to as "self-tolerance". However, in certain
circumstances these mechanisms may fail to prevent the
stimulation of such an immune response and this condition
is referred to as "auto-immunity". A number of diseases in
humans and animals are now thought to result from auto-immunity.One such condition is rheumatoid arthritis, a common,
progressive and crippling disease, which is associated with
the production by an animal of antibodies against its own
IgG. The inflammation of and consequent damage to the
joints associated with the disease are probably mediated
via immune complexes. Diseases in which inflammation of
and damage to the joints arise from auto-immunity are
referred to generically herein as "T-cell mediated
inflammation of the joint synovium".The CDw52 antigen (a 23kDa glycoprotein also referred
to as CAMPATH-1) is strongly expressed on the surface of
all human lymphocytes and most monocytes but is absent from
other blood cells including stem cells. A number of
antibodies have been developed directed against CDw52 which
is an unusually good target for complement-mediated attack.
Antibodies against CDw52 bind to all lymphocytes and
monocytes but lyse only lymphocytes (T and B) invivo.
Antigens similar to CDw52 are expressed in other mammalian
species.Antibodies which have been developed against CDw52 and
which have been used in therapy include the following: 
CAMPATH-1M is a rat IgM monoclonal antibody which as
been used extensively invitro for purging bone marrow
harvests in order to deplete the T cell population prior to
bone marrow transplantation. Marked reductions in the
incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease has
been seen with this therapy.CAMPATH-1G is a rat IgG2b class-switch variant of an
IgG2a antibody recognising the CDw52 antigen which has been
used invivo to achieve immunosuppression in more than 100
patients undergoing organ and bone marrow transplantation,
management of organ rejection and treatment of haematologic
malignancies with a high level of success. However, the
rapid development of an anti-rat immunoglobulin response,
including the possibility of anaphylaxis, is likely to
limit the use of rat monoclonal antibodies against the
CDw52 antigen in
