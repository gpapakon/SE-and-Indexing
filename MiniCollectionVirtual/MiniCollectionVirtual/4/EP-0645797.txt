<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a pattern, notably a grating for semiconductor 
lasers, on the substrate of an integrated circuit by means of electron beam lithography. 

The adverse effects of the known proximity effect are prevented by additional exposure 
of the substrate in regions adjacent the region in which the pattern is to be written. Such 

additional exposure can take place with a resolution which is substantially less than that 
within the pattern, so that a substantial gain in time is realised relative to customary 

"ghost" exposure methods. Moreover, the proximity effect can thus be utilized to 
impose the longitudinal variation desired for laser use on the duty cycle of the grating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of forming a pattern in a pattern region 
on the substrate of an integrated circuit by writing by means of a beam of electrically 
charged particles, the desired pattern being formed by moving the beam of given cross-section 
along desired contours in the pattern region on the substrate, additional exposure 
of the substrate being performed in locations other than the desired contours of the 
pattern. The invention also relates to an integrated circuit manufactured by means 
of said method. A method of this kind is described in United States Patent Specification 
No. 4,463,265. During the writing of patterns on an integrated circuit by means of a beam 
of charged particles, (for example by means of electrons, which is referred to 
hereinafter as electron beam lithography), a problem is encountered in that the smallest 
structural dimension (the resolution) that can be achieved for the pattern to be written is 
dependent on the nature of the pattern to be written, and hence is variable across the 
pattern region. This is caused by a phenomenon which is referred to as the proximity 
effect. This effect occurs in that electrons having traversed the photoresist layer are 
scattered in the substrate situated therebelow and are thus returned to the photoresist 
layer, be it usually in a location adjacent the location of incidence of the primary beam. 
Consequently, the background exposure of the pattern to be written is increased, i.e. in 
proportion to the density of the desired patterns to be written at this area. The cited 
United States Patent Specification includes a clear explanation (notably in the columns 1 
and 2 up to line 56) as to how the proximity effect influences the resolution of the 
pattern to be written by electron beam lithography. The cited document also proposes 
methods (column 2, line 57 as far as column 3 line 20) whereby the problem of limited 
resolution can be mitigated. Each of these methods has its own drawbacks as is also 
disclosed in the cited United States Patent Specification (column 3, lines 21-64).  In order to solve this problem, the cited US Patent Specification proposes 
an additional exposure of the substrate in the region in which the desired pattern is also 
written, be it not coincident with the lines of the pattern to be written. To this end, a 
complementary field pattern (reverse field pattern) is defined, being the region of the 
resist which is situated between the structures of the pattern to be written and which is 
not to be

A method of forming a pattern in a pattern region on the substrate of an 
integrated circuit by writing by means of a beam of electrically charged particles, the 

desired pattern being formed by moving the beam of given cross-section along desired 
contours in the pattern region on the substrate, additional exposure of the substrate 

being performed in locations other than the desired contours of the pattern, 
characterized in that the additional exposure is performed in a region which is situated 

outside but adjacent the pattern region, said additional exposure being performed with a 
beam current which is much larger than that used for the exposure in the pattern region, 

and that the write pattern in the neighbouring region exhibits minimum structural 
dimensions which are much larger than those in the pattern region. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the neighbouring 
region directly adjoins the pattern region. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the neighbouring 
region is uniformly exposed. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the pattern to be 
written is a grating consisting of parallel lines, and that the neighbouring region is 

exposed in blocks whose exposure varies in a direction transversely of the line 
direction, the dimension of said blocks in the direction transversely of the line direction 

being much larger than the period of the grating. 
A semiconductor laser with a substrate with a substrate provided with a 
pattern region which constitutes a line grating which has been produced by means of a 

method as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 4.
