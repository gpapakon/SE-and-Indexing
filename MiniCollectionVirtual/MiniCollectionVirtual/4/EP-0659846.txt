<ABSTRACT>
Pigmented powder coating products based on low melting point fluorine-based 
terpolymers, preferably on those made from a majority of vinylidene 

fluoride copolymerised with tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropene, are 
capable of providing regulable gloss coatings. The process for preparing 

coatings from the powders is essentially characterised by the selection of 
the temperature by which the desired gloss can be obtained. Low to high 

gloss can be obtained, and the mechanical properties are excellent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluorinated powder coating products,
based on certain vinylidene fluoride terpolymers (hereinafter referred to
as VdFT), for preparing fluorinated coatings having regulable gloss and to
a process for coating a substrate with a pigmented fluorinated coating
having regulable gloss. In particular, the present invention relates to
the use of certain vinylidene fluoride terpolymers in pigmented powder
coating products, for obtaining fluorinated protective coatings having
regulable gloss.Coatings based on vinylidene fluoride homopolymers (hereinafter PVdF)
are known to be very useful as protective coatings for a variety of
substrates due to the good chemical and weathering resistance and to the
thermal stability of PVdF. The general known technique used for preparing
them is to prepare a dispersion of PVdF in a suitable solvent for
application by known means onto the required substrate which is thereafter
subjected to a heat treatment.The solvent used is generally known in the prior art as "latent
solvent", and it is described therein as an organic solvent which has no
significant action on PVdF at room temperature but which at an elevated
temperature exerts a sufficient solvent action.However, although the known systems may give good results,
environmental protection laws throughout the world, but mainly in Europe
and in the U.S.A., are making it increasingly difficult to handle
solvent-based systems. Further, the recovery of the solvent is a costly
procedure. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for solventless
PVdF-based coatings.GB-2194539-A to Labofina discloses pigmented PVdF-based powder coating
products essentially consisting of vinylidene fluoride homopolymer (or
copolymer with at most 10 wt% of comonomer units), one or more compatible
thermoplastic resin and one or more pigments. It also discloses a process
for preparing the products. However, the gloss obtained is not regulable.EP-456018-A to Elf Atochem North America discloses pigmented powder
coatings of vinylidene fluoride/hexafluoropropylene copolymers, the resin 
component comprising 50-90 wt% of said copolymers having a melt viscosity
of 1-4 kPoise [100-400 Pa.s] at 100 s-1 and 232°C, said copolymers being
characterised by a melting point in the range of about 160°C to about 170°C
(which closely approaches the melting point of PVdF), and 50-10 wt% of
thermoplastic acrylic resin. The resulting coatings are said to be
characterised by improved flexibility, crack resistance and surface
smoothness (as opposed
