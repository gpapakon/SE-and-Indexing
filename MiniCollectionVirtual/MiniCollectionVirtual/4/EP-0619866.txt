<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related in general to a method
and apparatus for solidification of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
in particular to a method and apparatus for automatic
production at a low pressure of blocks of solid carbon
dioxide with a density of 1.1 to 1.50 g/cm3 or greater.The process of solidification of liquid CO2 to
form solid CO2, commonly called "dry ice", is a widely known
process, with the product being used commercially to
transport and store medicines or already frozen or fresh
foods, to cause artificial rain, to extinguish fire, to
contract metal, etc.Typically, the conventional processes for
producing solid CO2 involve first creating a mass of CO2
snow at a pressure near atmospheric pressure, and then
compressing this mass, giving it a definite form and
specific density. The average capacity of the conventional
equipment to produce cubes of solid CO2 with standard
measurements (25.4 cm x 25.4 cm x 25.4 cm) is approximately
1 cube/5-6 min. or more and the equipment consists
basically of: a) closed chambers designed to support the
conditions inherent in the formation of carbon dioxide
snow; b) gas recovery equipment; c) hydraulic compression
systems; d) CO2 storage tanks to which the gas returns, and
e) condensation systems.This equipment operates fundamentally by
expanding liquid CO2 to a pressure near 5 kg/cm2 to create
a mass of carbon dioxide snow from which gas is extracted
via a compression element, to thus be able to reach a 
pressure close to atmospheric pressure, and later
compressing this mass at 125 kg/cm2 in a mold by means of a
hydraulic system so that the resulting compressed mass of
dry ice is later expelled with a maximum density of 1.55
g/cc3. Because of the relatively high pressures required to
compress the carbon dioxide snow to form a block of
relatively high density, the equipment required is
expensive to build and to operate.Other processes that differ from the above,
already traditionally used, have been disclosed in many
patents, which are generally based on the thermodynamic
properties of CO2.The concepts and details of the known processes
and equipment can be found disclosed in the following U.S.
patents: 1,925,041;
1,925,619; 1,870,691; 1,950,180; 1,795,772; 2,738,658;
4,033,736; 3,817,045 and 4,780,119.U.S. Patent No. 1,925,041 to Auerbach describes
a two-stage process where initially a layer of solid CO2 is
created in the bottom of a mold that serves as a seal and
support, which is sufficiently dense to prevent the passage
of gaseous CO2 across it, after which
