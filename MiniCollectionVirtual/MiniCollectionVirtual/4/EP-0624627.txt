<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is an improved radiation-curable organopolysiloxane 
composition capable of giving a cured surface film on a substrate 

surface which exhibits excellent releasability against sticky 
substances. The composition is obtained by combining two kinds of 

(meth)acryloxyalkyl-containing organopolysiloxanes in a specified 
weight proportion, of which one has a relatively large degree of 

polymerization but contains only a relatively small amount of the 
silicon-bonded (meth)acryloxyalkyl groups while the other has a 

relatively small degree of polymerization but contains a relatively 
large amount of the silicon-bonded (meth)acryloxyalkyl groups. By 

virtue of this unique formulation, the surface-release sheet provided 
with a cured surface film of this organopolysiloxane composition 

and attached to a sticky surface for temporary protection is 
safe from generation of a peeling noise which is unavoidable in the 

prior art when a surface-release sheet is peeled off from the sticky 
surface at a high peeling velocity, especially, when the peeling resistance 

is great.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radiation-curable organopolysiloxane 
composition or, more particularly, to a radiation-curable 
organopolysiloxane composition which, when cured by the irradiation 
with radiation on a substrate such as plastic films, forms 
a cured surface film having excellent adhesive bonding strength to 
the substrate surface and capable of exhibiting excellent releasability 
against sticky substances. Various types of radiation-curable organopolysiloxane compositions 
are known in the prior art, of which those of a typical 
class comprise an organopolysiloxane having (meth)acryloxy, i.e. 
acryloxy and/or methacryloxy, groups in the molecule, and proposals 
are found, for example, in Japanese Patent Kokai 48-48000, 63-135426, 
2-45532 and 2-163166 and elsewhere. One of the important 
applications of these radiation-curable organopolysiloxane 
compositions is as a surface-treatment coating agent on various 
kinds of substrate surfaces such as the back surface of pressure-sensitive 
adhesive tapes, temporary protecting sheets for pressure-sensitive 
adhesive labels and the like by virtue of the excellent releasability 
against sticky substances exhibited by the cured film of 
the composition. It is a trend in recent years that the bonding work for attaching 
these pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes or labels to the surface  
 
of a substrate is conducted at a high speed by using a machine with 
rapid rewinding of the adhesive tape from a roll or by peeling the 
temporary protecting releasable sheet off from the adhesive surface 
of the labels. A problem in such a bonding work is that, when 
the sticky adhesive surface coated with a pressure-sensitive adhesive 
and the releasable surface having a cured film of the organopolysiloxane 
composition are separated at a high speed, a noise, 
called a peeling noise, is unavoidably generated, which is sometimes 
so high as to cause deterioration of the working environments. Generation of the above mentioned peeling noise means, in 
an aspect, that the resistance against peeling to separate the adhesive 
surface and the releasable surface is under uncontrollable 
fluctuation in a range so large that the machine-bonding works of 
the pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes or labels, which must desirably 
be conducted under a constant peeling resistance, is greatly 
affected thereby to cause inaccuracy in the attaching position of 
the tapes or labels. It is empirically known that the peeling noise is 
generated when the peeling resistance exceeds a
