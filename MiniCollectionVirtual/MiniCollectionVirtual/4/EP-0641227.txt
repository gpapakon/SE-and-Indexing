<ABSTRACT>
A needle for piercing a septum of a vacuum sealed container (34) and through which a measured fluid sample (32) from the container may be withdrawn. The needle comprises: an elongated body (10) with a longitudinal axis, an unobstructed bore (30) therethrough along said axis, a free end (28), and an end region (8) adjacent to said free end (28) which has a slight conical taper toward the free end (28) at a predetermined angle relative to the longitudinal axis. The free end (28) comprises an oblique cut through the conically tapered end region (8) at an angle (36) relative to the longitudinal axis being substantially larger than the predetermined angle of the taper so as to produce an elliptical opening (30) at the free end (28). The elliptical opening (30) lies along a plane to the longitudinal axis producing a toe or tip reduced in height for decreasing the dead volume of the needle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for withdrawing a measured fluid sample from a
container and, more particularly, for use in an automated
blood/plasma sampling system, for example as disclosed in
EP 0 504 313.Fluid samples, such as blood or plasma, are stored in
containers, such as test tubes, which are vacuum sealed by
way of a rubber septum that must be pierced in order to
withdraw a measured amount of the sample for testing purposes.Known needles or piercing and sampling probes withdraw
samples from these vacuum sealed containers, e.g.
Vacutainers (TM), by means of a two part device. These
sampling devices include an outer piercing sheath having a
beveled edge for piercing the septum and, an inner, more
narrow sampling probe which may be lowered through the
outer sheath into the vacuum sealed container to withdraw
a measured amount of fluid for testing. In this known
mechanism, the tip of the inner, more narrow sampling probe 
comprises a flat edge, as it is not required to pierce the
septum. This flat edge provides greater accuracy in the
withdrawing and delivery of the fluid sample.However, there are several disadvantages with this
type of coaxial piercing and sampling probe arrangement.
First, it involves a two step process, piercing the septum
with the outer, larger diameter sheath and lowering the
inner, more narrow sampling probe through the sheath into
the vacuum sealed container to withdraw the test sample.
This process is somewhat cumbersome as it requires two
separate drive mechanisms, one for the outer sheath and
another for the sampling probe itself. This complexity
adds to the overall expense of the device.In US-A-2 717 600 a piercing and sampling
probe is described having a single needle with a beveled edge which is
used to pierce the septum of the vacuum sealed container
and through which a measured fluid sample may be withdrawn.
One problem with this device is that for small sample
volumes, the angle of the bevel needed to pierce the septum
is too steep so that a lot of dead volume remains in the
sample container. That is, when the needle abuts the
bottom of the sample container, the height of the
elliptical opening at the needle tip causes the needle to
begin drawing in air while a relatively large residual
volume of sample still remains in the container. It is an object of the present invention to reduce the
complexity and cost of the known piercing and sampling
probe mechanisms described above.It is a further object of the invention to provide a
means for

<CLAIMS>
A needle suitable for piercing a septum of a vacuum
sealed container and through which a measured fluid

sample from the container may be withdrawn, comprising:
an elongated body (10) having a longitudinal axis (6),

an unobstructed bore (20) therethrough along the
longitudinal axis (6), a free end (28), and an end

region (8) adjacent said free end (28), comprising an
oblique cut (18) through the end region (8) at an angle

(36) relative to the longitudinal axis so as to produce
an elliptical opening (30) at the free end (28) on a

plane oblique to the longitudinal axis (6), said free
end (28) further comprising a toe portion (26) which

initially encounters the septum and slices a path
therethrough and a heel portion (14) which follows the

path of the toe portion (26), said heel portion being
passivated so as to prevent septum coring
characterised in that
,

said end region (8) adjacent said free end (28)
comprises a slight conical taper toward said free end

at a predetermined angle (16) relative to the
longitudinal axis, said predetermined angle (16) of the

conical taper being substantially smaller than the
angle (36) relative to the longitudinal axis whereby

said toe portion (26) is reduced in height relative to
said heel portion (14).
A needle according to claim 1, wherein said free end
(28) is deflected such that the toe portion (26) aligns

along the longitudinal axis (6) of said elongated body
(10).
A needle according to claim 1, further comprising a
non-stick coating on inner and outer surfaces of said

elongated body (10).
A piercing and sampling probe for piercing a septum
of a vacuum sealed container and withdrawing a measured

fluid sample from the container, comprising a first
longitudinal section (22) having an inner diameter (2)

defining a volume for holding a measured fluid sample,
and a second longitudinal section (24) constituting a

needle integrally connected to said first longitudinal 
section (22) for piercing the septum of the vacuum

sealed container, withdrawing the fluid sample and
passing it into said first longitudinal section (22),

said second longitudinal section (24) having inner (5)
and outer (3) diameters of more narrow dimensions than

that of said first longitudinal section (22),

characterised in that
 said needle is a needle according
to claims 1 to 3.
