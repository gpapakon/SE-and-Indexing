<ABSTRACT>
Intersecting quantum wells form a T-shaped structure. Quantum bound states 
exist due to the spreading out of the wave function in the T-junction region. The 

confined state leads to formation of a quantum wire in which one-dimensional carrier 
behavior extends along a wire-like region defined by the intersecting planes of the two 

wells. By embedding such a region in a T-shaped optical waveguide, a quantum wire 
laser characterized by low-threshold stimulated emission in the one-di
mensional 
quantum limit is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lasers and, more particularly, to quantum wire 
(QWR) lasers operating in the quantum limit. It is well known that quantum well (QWL) semiconductor lasers exhibit 
improved performance characteristics compared to conventional heterostructure diode 
lasers. In QWL lasers, charge carriers are quantum confined in one dimension in 
extremely thin active layers. Additionally, it is known that further improvement in 
semiconductor laser performance can be expected if quantum confinement can be 
achieved in more than one dimension. In an article entitled "Quantum Wire Lasers", by E. Kapon, 
Proceedings of the IEEE, 
Vol. 80, No. 3, March 1992, pages 398-410, there are described quasi one-dimensional 
structures in which optical gain is provided by charge carriers that are 
quantum-mechanically confined in two dimensions within wire-like active regions. 
Such QWR lasers are predicted to exhibit lower threshold currents, higher modulation 
bandwidths, narrower spectral linewidths and reduced temperature sensitivity 
compared to their QWL counterparts. In practice, however, it has become evident that the actual fabrication of 
quantum-size structures with precise control in more than one dimension is an 
extremely challenging task. Several techniques for making such structures have been 
reported. Some of these techniques suffer from problems such as size fluctuations, 
interfacial disorder and the introduction of nonradiative recombination centers which 
wipe out quantum effects stemming from reduced dimensionality. One reported 
technique [see E. Kapon et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 63, 430(1989)] has been demonstrated 
to be a powerful one for fabricating quasi quantum wires exhibiting some 
characteristics of two-dimensional carrier confinement. But, as a consequence of the 
relatively large size of the wire-like structure achieved thereby, many one-dimensional 
subbands exist and, due to band-filling effects, only higher-order transitions can be 
observed in the stimulated emission spectra. Since the density-of-states spectrum in  
 
this energetic region already approaches that of the two-dimensional case, no 
improvement in threshold current over conventional QWL lasers was reported. Accordingly, efforts have continued by workers skilled in the art directed at 
trying to provide improved QWR structures. In particular, these efforts have been 
directed at trying to develop a QWR structure having an extremely small cross-section 
that could in practice be fabricated to exhibit confinement
