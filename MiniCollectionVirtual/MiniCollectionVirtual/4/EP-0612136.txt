<ABSTRACT>
A brush holder which is simple in production-engineering terms and nevertheless ensures a good low-noise level can be achieved by means of a brush plate (2) having moulded-on brush boxes (2.1; 2.2) which are axially open at one end, the free pressure limbs (3.1; 4.1) of a spring clip (3; 4) ensuring that the inserted brushes (5; 6), which are preferably curved in the contact-pressure direction, are both pressed against the commutator (7) at an oblique angle and are axially secured in position with respect to the open end of the brush boxes (2.1; 2.2).

Brush holder arrangement for a commutator motor 
having the features: 


a) A brush plate (2) is provided with brush boxes (2.1; 
2.2) which are open to one axial end in the sense of 

an axial brush plug-in mounting; 
b) The brush plate (2) is provided with brush contact-pressure 
spring holders (2.3; 2.4), which project 

axially in the same direction in the sense of a 
brush contact-pressure spring plug-on mounting 

holder; 
c) spring clips which act as brush contact-pressure 
springs (3; 4), in each case have one free contact-pressure 

limb (3.1; 4.1) which, in operation, rests 
radially on the brushes (5; 6) in the sense of a 

contact pressure which is directed at an oblique 
angle to the commutator (7); 
d) the brush plate (2) is provided with at least one, 
in each case radially projecting, fixing lug (2.5; 

2.6) whose free end can be gripped, during installation 
of a brush contact-pressure spring (3; 4) by 

the contact-pressure limbs (3.1; 4.1) of said brush 
contact-pressure spring (3; 4), in such a manner 

that said contact-pressure limb (3.1; 4.1) comes to 
rest against the fixing lug (2.5; 2.6), in operation, 

in the sense of an axial securing stop in the 
direction opposite to installation. 
Brush holder arrangement according to Claim 1 having 
the feature:
 
   f) The brush plate (2) is provided with at least one,  

 
in each case radially projecting, fixing lug (2.7; 

2.8) behind which the brush contact-pressure springs 
(3; 4) can be inserted, in each case by means of a 

free supporting limb (3.2; 4.2), in the sense of an 
axial position securing device or anti-rotation 

securing device when said springs (3, 4) reach their 
final plug-on mounting position. 
Brush holder arrangement according to at least 
one of Claims 1 or 2 having the feature:
 
   g) the brush plate (2) is provided with at least one, 

in each case radially projecting, stop tongue (2.51; 
2.61) against which in each case one free contact-pressure 

limb (3.1; 4.1) is stopped, such that 
movement is constrained, before a contact position 

with the commutator (7). 
Brush holder arrangement according to at least 
one of Claims 1-3, having the feature:
 
   h) The brushes (5; 6) have in their end region which 

faces radially away from the commutator (7) a shoulder 
which is in the form of a step, accommodates the 

free contact-pressure limbs (3.1; 4.1) of the brush 
contact-pressure springs (3; 4) and has a tangential 

brush contact-pressure surface (5.1; 6.1) and a 
radial brush fixing surface (5.2; 6.2). 
Brush holder arrangement according to at least 
one of Claims 1-4, having the feature:
 
   i) The brush boxes (1.2; 2.2) and the brushes (5; 6) 

are curved in the sense of increased brush length in 
the contact-pressure direction. 
Brush holder device according to Claim 5, having 
the feature:
 
   j) The brush boxes (2.1; 2.2) and the brushes (5; 6) 

are curved in the form of part of a circle. 
Brush holder arrangement according to at least of 
Claims 1-6 having the feature:
 
   k) Contact-pressure force transmission, which is preferably 

in the form of a point as a result of appropriate 
surface curvature, is provided between the  

 
brush contact-pressure surface (5.1; 6.1) on the one 

hand and that free contact-pressure limb (3.1; 4.1) 
which in each case rests on said brush contact-pressure 

surface (5.1; 6.1) on the other, eccentrically 
with respect to the brush longitudinal direction 

of symmetry, in the sense of oblique positioning 
of the brushes (5; 6), which oblique position is 

constant irrespective of the rotation direction of 
the commutator (7), within the clearance of the said 

brushes (5, 6) in the brush boxes (2.1; 2.2). 
Brush holder arrangement according to at least 
one of Claims 1-7 having the feature:
 
   l) The brush plate (2) is provided with suppression 

inductor retaining pockets (8) and/or thermal monitor 
retaining pockets (9). 
Brush holder arrangement according to at least 
one of Claims 1-8 having the feature:
 
   m) The brush plate (2) and the brush boxes (2.1; 2.2) 

as well as the brush contact-spring holders (2.3; 
2.4) and the fixing l
ugs (2.5; 2.6) as well as the 
fixing tabs (2.7; 2.8) and the stop tongues (2.51; 

2.61) as well as the suppression inductor holder 
pockets (8) and the thermal monitors (9) are parts 

of an injection-moulded plastic part which can 
preferably be produced only using moulding tools 

which can be drawn axially.
