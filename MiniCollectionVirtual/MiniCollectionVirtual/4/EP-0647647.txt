wherein R¹ and R² represent independently from each other a hydrogen 
atom or a methyl group, or together form -CH=CH-CH=CH-; R³ is a 

hydrogen atom or a cycloalkyl group having 5 to 7 carbon atoms or a 
lower alkyl group which may be substituted with a halogen atom, a 

lower alkoxy group, a lower alkoxyalkoxy group or a phenyl group; X¹ 
is a halogen atom when both R¹ and R² are hydrogen atoms, or a hydrogen 

atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group or a lower alkoxy group 
when at least one of R¹ and R² is not a hydrogen atoms; and m is an 

integer of 1 to 5, which is useful as a ligand of a transition metal 
complex that can catalyze various reactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tertiary phosphine
compound which is coordinated to various transition metals to form
catalysts useful in asymmetric synthesis reactions and a transition
metal complex comprising said phosphine compound as ligand.Hitherto, many reports have been made on transition
metal catalysts used in the asymmetric synthesis reactions. It is
well known that, among these catalysts, complexes of transition
metals such as ruthenium, palladium and rhodium which comprise an
optically active tertiary phosphine compound as a ligand have the
excellent catalytic activities in the asymmetric syntheses (see
JAPAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY Ed., ELEMENTS OF CHEMISTRY ("KAGAKU
SOSETSU") 32, "Chemistry of Organic Metal Complexes" (1982) 237 -
238).JP-A-5-17491(1993) describes
that 2-diphenylphosphino-2'-methoxy-1,1'-binaphthyl having
an axial asymmetry is an excellent ligand, and
   JP-A-5-238964(1993) discloses an asymmetric formic
acid reduction of a substituted allyl alcohol derivative using a catalyst
having the above binaphthyl compound as a ligand. But, a selectivity
and a yield of the reaction product can be still improved.JP-A-5- 255353 (1993)
discloses an asymmetric hydrosilylation of a bicyclo[2.2.n]-compound 
with the above catalyst. However, the reaction tends to proceed
explosively, while an asymmetric yield is decreased when a solvent
is used to control the reaction. Therefore, the disclosed reaction is
not necessarily satisfactory.Y. Uozumi et al., J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58, 1945-1948 disclose the synthesis of 2-(diphenylphosphino)-2'-alkoxy-1,1'binaphthyls. The authors equally refer to the suitability of such compounds as efficient chiral phosphine ligands.An object of the present invention is to provide a novel
phosphine compound which can unexpectedly improve catalytic activities
such as stereoselectivity or position selectivity and a conversion,
which are unsatisfactory with the conventional catalysts.Another object of the present invention is to provide
industrially advantageous processes for preparing an optically active
alpha-olefin compound and an optically active organic silicon compound,
in which control of the reaction is easy.According to a first aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a tertiary phosphine compound of the formula (1):

wherein R1 and R2 represent independently from each other a hydrogen
atom or a methyl group, or together form a group of the formula:
-CH=CH-CH=CH-;
R3 is a hydrogen atom or a cycloalkyl group having 5 to 7 carbon
atoms or a lower alkyl
