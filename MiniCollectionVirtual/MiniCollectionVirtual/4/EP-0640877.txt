<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imaging element for making 
improved aluminum offset printing plates according to the silver 
salt diffusion transfer process. Furthermore the present invention 
relates to a method for making improved aluminum offset printing 
plates with said imaging element. The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal 
process, hereinafter called DTR process, have been described e.g. in 
US-P-2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion 
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London 
and New York, (1972). In the DTR process non-developed silver halide of an 
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer 
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into 
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into 
an image receiving layer and are reduced therein with a developing 
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to 
form a silver image having reversed image density values 
("DTR image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the 
exposed areas of the photographic material. A DTR image bearing material can be used as a planographic 
printing plate wherein the DTR silver image areas form the 
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive 
ink-repellant background. The DTR image can be formed in the image receiving layer of a 
sheet or web material which is a separate element with respect to 
the photographic silver halide emulsion material (a so-called 
two-sheet DTR element) or in the image receiving layer of a 
so-called single-support-element, also called mono-sheet element, 
which contains at least one photographic silver halide emulsion 
layer integral with an image receiving layer in waterpermeable 
relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet version which is 
preferred for the preparation of offset printing plates by the DTR 
method.  Two main types of mono-sheet DTR materials that are distinct 
because of their different layer arrangement and processing are 
known. The first type of mono-sheet DTR material comprises on a 
support, generally paper or a resin support such as polyester, in 
the order given a silver halide emulsion layer and an image 
receiving layer containing physical development nuclei as a surface 
layer. After information-wise exposure and development according to 
the DTR process a silver image is formed in the surface layer. 
Since the underlying layers are hydrophilic in nature and the

hydrophilic grained and anodized aluminum support, (ii) an image 

receiving layer containing physical development nuclei and (iii) a 
photosensitive layer containing a silver halide emulsion being in 

water permeable relationship with said image receiving layer 
characterized in that the sum of the surface areas of subsidences 

amounts to at least 50 % of the total surface area, a subsidence 
being a section of the real surface of the grained and anodized side 

of said support having continuously a depth of at least 0.5 µm, a 
protuberance being a section of the real surface of the grained and 

anodized side of said support having continuously a depth of less 
than 0.5 µm, said depths being measured perpendicular to the
