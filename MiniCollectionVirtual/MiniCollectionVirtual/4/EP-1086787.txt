<ABSTRACT>
An improved utility bar (10) includes an elongate shank (11) which
has a longitudinal axis (A), a prying hook (12) at one end and a prying

chisel (14) at the other end. The prying hook (12) has a tapered portion
(18) extending along a direction generally an angle α with the

longitudinal axis (A) and a generally U-shaped portion (16) integrally
formed with the shank (11) and the tapered portion (18). The tapered and

U-shaped portions together form a prying footprint surface (19) facing a
direction away from the shank (11). The angle α is selected to be

greater than 90° and preferably selected within the range of 93°-110°.
The prying footprint has a minimum transverse dimension which is

substantially greater than the minimum cross sectional dimension of the
shank (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to hand tools and, more specifically, to an
improved utility bar for moving or prying objects.Numerous utility bars or prying tools have been known, these exhibiting
different configurations and sizes. All of the bars in this category operate on the
principle of the simple first class lever. A first class lever is a lever wherein the load
to be overcome is at or near one end of a rod or bar, and the effort or force is
applied at or near the other end of the rod or bar, and the fulcrum, or pivot, is
somewhere along the rod or bar inbetween the applied force and load. Thus, the
user seeks to obtain a mechanical advantage by placing one end of the bar adjacent
to the surface to be moved, and providing a pivot point about which a longer
moment arm is provided so that substantial forces can be provided to the surface
and/or the object to be pried open or moved. For example, one utility bar is a
ripping bar in the form of a straight elongate bar having a generally hexagonal cross
section and provided with a wedge or tapered end that can be forced between two
adjacent surfaces. However, because such a ripping bar is a straight bar, it has 
limitations in the applications for which it can be used. For example, it is not
convenient to use it when a heavy object has a surface in contact with a floor or has
a surface which is in contact with a wall. Because the tapered or beveled edge must
be inserted while the bar is substantially parallel to the floor or wall, respectively, it
may be difficult in some instances for the bar to be held by the user since that
portion of the bar which is held by the user's hand may be too close to or may abut
an adjacent surface. A wrecking bar similarly has an elongate member of hex cross
section provided with a tapered or beveled chisel tip, which may be somewhat offset
from the longitudinal axis of the bar at one end. The other end of the bar is similarly
provided with a tapered or beveled edge which is, however, bent between 90° and
180° so as to form a neck portion with the second beveled or tapered tip being
directed in a direction substantially the same as the first tip. While this tool may be
useful in applying prying forces to relatively small areas, such as automobile
wrecks, it suffers the same aforementioned disadvantages of the ripping bar insofar
as moving objects close to a floor or wall surface since such surfaces become
obstacles to the convenient insertion of the tapered or beveled edges between the
surfaces to be pried.A utility
