<ABSTRACT>
In an automatic coupling for rail vehicles, in addition to the coupling bodies which produce the mechanical connection between two vehicles and have a locking system line couplings are provided which in the coupled state produce the connection of the air lines and the electrical lines. The closure components of the locking system of the automatic coupling are decoupled with the aid of an actuation device. The actuation device is simultaneously provided for releasing at least one of the electric couplings of the line coupling and preferably for indirectly or directly drawing back the same such that no damage to the longitudinal guide of the electric coupling is caused by the transverse movement which is forcibly brought about by the mechanical coupling after it has been unlocked.
