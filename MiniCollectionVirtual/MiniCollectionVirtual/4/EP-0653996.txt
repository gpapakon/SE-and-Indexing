<ABSTRACT>
A container (1) for a lubricant has a cap (3) for sealing off one end (4) of a cylindrical tube (2). The cap shows a bottom (19), from the periphery of which extends in axial direction a circumferential interior ring part (17), which faces the inside of said tube end. The cap (3) rests with a radially extended ring part (16) connecting to said interior ring part (17) upon a radial end surface of said tube end (4). According to the invention, the latter end shows a circumferential flange edge printed obliquely inwardly towards the central part of the tube (2) and being intended to act upon on exterior circumferential bulge (24) on the outside of cap wall (17). For optimal insertion into the tube (2) with passing said edge (18), said bulge (24) forms downwardly a longer bevel (24) with a minor style in relation to said wall (17), while for optimal locking, said bulge (24) is upwardly more acutely rounded close to said lateral wall (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container with at least one 
closure means according to the preamble of claim 1. The invention is particularly concerned with lubricant cartridges 
and caps for sealing same. Today, consciousness towards the environment is greater than in the 
past and containers must fulfill high safety demands, particularly 
for substances which are detrimental to the environment. Nevertheless, such containers should be simple and easy to produce 
at low costs and their handling should also be easy and simple, 
both as to filling, preferably fully automatic sealing as well as 
repeated sealing at great and maintained safety, even after repeated 
opening and closing operations. The closure means should even 
be able to resist outer and interior strain up to a certain level, 
so that leakage may be avoided with comparatively great security. 
Furthermore, the contents of such a container must be fed out in a 
simple and reliable way. The previously known containers and their closure means do not 
fulfill these demands, at least not in combination. Caps which are previously known in this technical field, serve as 
sealing means for a cartridge or the like between its filling and 
use. When using the cartridge, the cap is normally removed and 
thrown away and has, therefore, no further function to fulfill. Beyond this limited function, previously known caps suffer often 
from the drawback, that they do not seal the container sufficiently 
safely. Leakage may thus occur easily and frequently and often a 
full container, maybe even adjacent containers, the contents of 
which has leaked out, are thrown away, as it can be rather unpleasant 
to get hands, clothes etc polluted. Apart from possible leakage, the previously known caps are nevertheless 
hard to remove, particularly caps which are not designed as  
 
screwcaps. If the caps are designed as screwcaps, i.a. increased 
material thickness is required as well as extra means to provide 
the cap with interior threads and furthermore extra means to provide 
the one cartridge end with outer threads. By US-A-4 307 817 there is previously known a lid and container 
combination according to the preamble of claim 1. The lid shows a 
planar bottom recessed into a downwardly open circumferential U-shaped 
rim which, according to an embodiment shown in Fig. 5, is 
pushed onto a frustroconical container rim. The latter shows an 
oblique circumferential skirt, which is directed inwardly towards 
the center of the container and is hooked onto a bead

<CLAIMS>
Container (1) comprising a cap (3) for sealing off one end (4) 
of in particular a mainly cylindrical tube (2) for e.g. a viscose 

or paste-like substance, e.g. a lubricant, silicon or food substance, 
which cap has a bottom (19), from the periphery of which 

projects in substantially axial direction a circumferential wall 
part (17) facing the inside of said tube end and terminating in a 

radially disposed ring part (16) abutting the said tube end (4), 
said wall part (17) having an annular bulge (24) disposed at an 

axial distance from the ring part (16), 
said tube end (4) being surrounded by a flange (5), which extends 

radially inside the interior cylindrical surface (7) of the tube 
wall (6) to form an interior flange part (9) having a delimitation 

surface (11) forming a stop surface of this tube end (4), the interior 
flange part being terminated towards the other tube end (30) 

by an undercut surface (13), which, in profile, may be straight or 
concave to form a circumferential flexible edge (18), which is intended 

to create a sealing effect in relation to the cap (3), 
characterized 
in that
 the annular edge (18) is shaped 
as a pointed lip, which is intended to enter with its tip into the 

angled area between the lateral wall (17) of the cap (3) and the adjoining 
bulge (24), the lip being flexible at least thanks to its 

shape to follow any deviations and movements and compensate same, 
even in combination with said cap, for e.g. material shrinking, and 

that the lip is intended to enter, due to its pointed shape, somewhat 
into the material of the cap and increase the sealing effect. 
Container according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the flange (5) extends, as known per se, radially 
even outside of the outer cylindrical surface (8) of the tube wall 

(6) to form an exterior flange part (10), that the interior flange 
part (9) projects longer from the adjacent cylindrical surface (7) 

than the exterior flange part (10) does from its adjacent surface 
(8), and/or that said cap (3) is provided to be retained by the 

interior flange part with greater force than the exterior flange 
part. 
Container according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that

circumferential edge (18) and said cap (3), the latter, as know per 

se, has a flexible bowl-like bottom (19), the convexity of which 
faces the interior of the tube, which bottom is intended to assume 

a flatter shape at increased interior and/or decreased exterior 
pressure with circumferential expansion of said wall part (17) in 

radial direction and increasing the sealing effect.

the interior annular part (17), counted from the annular part (16), 
that the cap periphery (16, 17, 20) confines an annular groove (21)

there are circumferential shoulders, bulges or the like (24 and 28, 

respectively), which are directed towards each other, but are
