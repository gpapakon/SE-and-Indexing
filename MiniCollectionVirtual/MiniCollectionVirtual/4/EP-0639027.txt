<ABSTRACT>
A video type color film analyzer for displaying simulated 
color print images of a plurality of picture frames of a 

color film in a matrix pattern on a video image display 
device, comprising image specifying means for specifying one 

of said color images which need not be printed and means for 
displaying an indication mark which overlaps part of said 

specified color image, said mark indicating that said 
specified print is not to be printed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
used for analysing or inspecting color films. Video type color film analyzers are well known in the art. 
One example disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
No.62 - 141,530 has a color TV camera for providing color image 
data of picture frames of a number of rolls of color films 
spliced one another. The color image data of the respective 
picture frames are stored in a memory. The color image data of 
each picture frame read out from the memory is, after having 
been transformed in gradation based on its large area 
transmittance density (LATD) and transformed from negative form 
to positive form, sent to one of a plurality of CRT displays 
arranged in a line to display a simulated color image thereon. 
Color film analyzer of this type can display a plurality of 
color images, simulated and to be simulated, on the CRT 
displays in a line. The center CRT display displays a color 
image under inspection and/or correction and the remaining CRT 
displays, in particular on one side of the center CRT display, 
color images inspected and corrected if needed and, on the  
 
opposite side of the center display, color images to be 
inspected. Therefore, the simulated color image on the center 
CRT display can be estimated comparing with adjacent corrected 
and uncorrected color images. In another color film analyzer of this type disclosed in, for 
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4 364 084 and 4 531 150, the color 
images simulated or to be simulated are displayed in a matrix 
pattern. Any one of the displayed color images, if undesirable 
in color and/or density as a printed image, is specified with 
such as a light pen to correct exposure. Image data of the 
specified image is transformed in gradation according to the 
corrected exposure so that the color image is correctly 
changed in color and/or density. The image data of picture frames to be displayed are written 
in and read out from an image memory as is disclosed in, for 
example, European Unexamined Patent Publication No. 108,158. Such video type color film analyzers are associated with 
various drawbacks. Because a roll of color film often 
includes frames bearing unintended principal subject images, 
blurred images or the like which usually need not be printed. 
The color film analyzers heretofore used are hard to specify 
an image or images which are unnecessary to print from visual 
inspection. It is therefore often to repeatedly specify 
picture frames having no necessity of print. A
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A video-type color film analyzer (10,32) for 
displaying simulated color print images of a 

plurality of picture frames of a color film in a 
matrix pattern on a video image display device, said 

analyzer comprising: 
image specifying means (40) for specifying one of 

said color images which need not be printed; and 
means for displaying an indication mark (49) which 

overlaps part of said specified color image, said 
mark indicating that said specified print is not to 

be printed. 
A video-type color film analyzer (10,32) as defined 
in claim 1, wherein said indication mark (49) is a 

negative image of said part of said specified color 
image.
