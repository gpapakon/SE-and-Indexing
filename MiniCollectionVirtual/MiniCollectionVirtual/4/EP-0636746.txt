<ABSTRACT>
A vibratory compacting machine (10) has a supplemental member (38) 
resiliently mounted on the frame (16) of the compacting machine (10). 

The supplemental member (38) has a resonant frequency that is 
substantially equal to the operating frequency of the vibratory 

compactor and effectively reduces the frame vibration. As a result of 
reduced frame vibration, the present invention provides increased 

operator comfort and extended service life of electronic, electrical and 
mechanical components mounted on the compacting machine (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a
vibratory compacting machine, and more particularly to
a vibratory compacting machine in which its frame is
vibrationally attenuated.Vibratory compactors typically comprise a
plate or drum that is oscillated or vibrated to impose
compaction forces on a densifiable surface, such as
ground soil, roadway base material, or paving
material. Generally the plate or drum member is
resiliently mounted on the frame of the compactor to
reduce the vibration forces transmitted, through the
frame, to other components of the machine (see EP-A-0 459 063).However, resiliently mounting the vibrating
member on the vehicle has been only partially
effective because of the inherent physical limitations
associated with such mounting arrangements. If the
spring rate, or stiffness, of the resilient attachment
elements is too low, the machine may be difficult to
control and the compaction forces transmitted to the
compactible material may be undesirably affected. A
high spring rate may produce excessive vibration of
the frame and machine components mounted on the frame,
such as bearings, drive train elements and the
operator's station. Therefore, the amount of
vibration isolation between the compacting element and
the frame of the compactor has heretofore been a
compromise in which neither compaction efficiency and 
machine controllability nor wear on machine elements
and operator comfort could be optimized without
undesirably affecting each other.The present invention is directed to
overcoming the problems set forth above. It is
desirable to have an apparatus that will attenuate the
vibrational forces transmitted by the frame of a
vibratory compactor to other components of the
machine. It is also desirable to have such an
apparatus that will not adversely affect the
interaction of the actively vibrated member with the
material being compacted.In accordance with the present
invention, a compacting machine having a frame, a
material contacting member, and means for vibrating
the material at a predetermined operating frequency,
includes a supplemental member and a plurality of
resilient mounting members connecting the supplemental
member to the frame. The resilient mounting members
have a spring rate that is selected to cooperate with
the mass of the supplemental member so that the
mounted supplemental member has a resonant frequency
that is substantially equal to the operating frequency
of the material contacting member.Fig. 1 is a side view of a vibratory
compactor embodying the present
