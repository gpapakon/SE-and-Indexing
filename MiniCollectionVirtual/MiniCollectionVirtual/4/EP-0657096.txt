A cultivating tray for growing plantlets, having pots which 
are moulded on the cover tray of the cultivating tray, in rows 

arranged parallel to one another, and which are downwardly 
oriented in opposition to the cover tray and have holes in their 

bases, and having a peripheral edge which is directed downwards 
from the cover plate, characterized in that in the first row (2), 

instead of the two outermost pots, two supports (8, 9) are 
provided, and in the last row (5), instead of the two next to 

outermost pots, two supports (25, 26) are provided which are 
hollow and are downwardly open and upwardly oriented, in that in 

the first row (2) the two next to outermost pots each have at the 
base a supporting ring (50), and in the last row the two 

outermost pots each have at the base a supporting ring (50), and 
in that a respective centring piece (19) is provided at the upper 

end (18) of the supports (8, 9, 25, 26). 
A cultivating tray according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the supports (8, 9, 25, 26) have in their walls (16, 17, 29) 

facing the cultivating tray (1) in each case an opening (23, 29). 
A cultivating tray according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the supporting rings (50) at the base of the two 

outermost and the two next to outermost pots have lateral cutouts 
(51). 
A cultivating tray according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the pots (6) are connected to stabilizing 

webs (48) below the cover tray (7). 
A cultivating tray according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that some of the stabilizing webs (48) are 

prolonged downwards in a particular pattern, in each case by the 
same amount.  

 
A cultivating tray according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the peripheral edge (40, 41, 42, 43) has 

on the four sides of the cultivating tray (1) a respective lower 
cutout (44, 45, 46, 47).
