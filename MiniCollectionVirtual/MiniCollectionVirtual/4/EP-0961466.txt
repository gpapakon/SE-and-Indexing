<ABSTRACT>
A feeding and recharging unit for portable telephone
sets, in particular cellular telephones, comprising a

telephone support (10) for wall-type mounting next to a
walled-in box, a recharging base (20) to be housed inside

said telephone support (10) having clamps (30) for
connecting to a feeding network or a low voltage circuit,

and an adapter (40), useful for various models of
cellular telephones, which can be inserted into the

recharging base (20) and provides a socket (50) contoured
for inserting the base of various types of telephone

sets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a feeding and recharging unit
for portable telephone sets, in particular cellular
telephones.At present, the recharging of the batteries of a cellular
telephone occurs thanks to the connection of a support
presenting a certain number of electrical contacts
connected to the accumulator devices contained in the
housing of the cellular set and the electrical supply
network at 230 Volt, through the plug of a transformer
circuit and an adapter and electrical cable connecting it
to the telephone support.This embodiment necessarily involves adopting a
connecting cable of greater or lesser length for the
recharging support, which could restrict the choice of
the possible installations of the feeding unit, which may
be more or less remote or uncomfortable to use with
respect to an electrical power supply socket; moreover,
every feeding and recharging unit is usually associated
with a respective cellular phone model and it is
impossible to recharge the accumulator batteries of a
telephone set by using a support and a teed transformer
especially built for another type of cellular phone
model. Finally, the arrangement of a transformer device
connected to an electrical power socket and electrical
cable attached to a support having a contoured area for 
inserting the base of a telephone set is a possible
source of accidents, owing to the extension of the
electrical cable or the instability of the support and
electrical contacts between the transformer plug and an
electrical supply socket.The scope of this invention is therefore to indicate a
feeding and recharging unit for portable telephone sets,
in particular for cellular telephones, capable of
overcoming the mentioned drawbacks, or to produce a
reliable feeding and recharging unit for cellular
telephones, which can be secure from an electrical safety
viewpoint and suitable for using with any model of
telephone set currently available on the market.Another scope of this invention is to produce a feeding
and recharging unit for portable telephones, in
particular for cellular telephones, whose harness wiring
is relatively simplified with respect to the connecting
systems and recharging supports off a traditional type.A further scope of this invention is to indicate a
feeding and recharging unit for portable telephone sets,
in particular for cellular telephones, which allows
mounting in walled-in boxes of a modular type for
connecting to the supply network.A further scope of this invention is to indicate a
feeding and recharging unit for
