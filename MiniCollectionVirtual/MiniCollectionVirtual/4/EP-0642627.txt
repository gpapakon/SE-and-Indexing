<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the operation of an internal combustion engine or a combustion plant in which liquid fuel is heated before being introduced into a combustion chamber. In order, especially with higher power outputs, to create a minimum quantity of pollutants, the fuel is taken to an intramolecular unstable state at about vaporisation temperature before its introduction into the combustion chamber by heating in a preheating stage to a basic temperature of between 40 and 60  DEG C, subsequent expansion of the fuel is produced in an expansion stage by heating to a temperature of between 50 and 150  DEG C at a constant energy density, subsequent conversion occurs in a reaction stage to an intramolecular unstable state by heating to a temperature of between 80 and 200  DEG C, with final heating in a vaporisation stage at a pressure of between 15 and 40 bar up to vaporisation temperature.
