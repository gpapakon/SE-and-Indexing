Data communication system with several subscriber terminal stations 
(31, 32, 33 ...), which are connected by transmission lines (310, 320, 

330, ...) for reciprocal data transfer, particularly in motor vehicles, 
with the following features: 


the transmission lines (310, 320, 330, ...) form at least one star-shaped 
network about a passive star node (K) with a load impedance 

(4), preferably an actual resistance, 
attenuating means (5), which transform an effective resistance 
component in the transmission lines at high frequency, are arranged at 

the ends of the transmission lines at the node side, 
the attenuating means are so selected that from each terminal station 
in direction to the network nodes the respective transmission line 

appears at least approximately terminated by its wave resistance for 
high frequency. 
System according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the system 
comprises several star-shaped networks each with a respective star node 

(40, 50), which are connected by connecting lines between their star 
nodes, that the attenuating means are arranged each time at the node-side 

ends of the transmission lines and the connecting lines, and that the 
load impedance (4) is present only once. 
System according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the load 
impedance (4) is concentrated in a central star node. 
System according to claim 2 or claim 3, characterised thereby that 
the connecting lines are of the same conductor type as the transmission 

lines. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby that 
the actual resistance value of the load impedance is at least 

approximately equal to the half wave resistance of the transmission 
lines.  

 
System according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby that 
the transmission lines are symmetrical lines and attenuating means of 

like characteristics are arranged each time on the two wires of a 
transmission line. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised thereby that 
the attenuating means (5) are attenuating beads of ferrite material. 
System according to claim 7, characterised thereby that the ferrite 
material of the attenuating beads is selected in such a manner that the 

time constant is small relative to the symbol duration of the 

transmission data and large relative to interference signals, or half 
waves of interference frequencies, occurring in the network. 
System according to claim 8, characterised thereby that the time 
constant is equal to or larger than twice the running time on the longest 

transmission line. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised by the 
symmetrising of the or each star node by a symmetrising transmitter (8) 

or a symmetrising choke, which is so connected that push-push signals are 
short-circuited and push-pull signals encounter a high impedance. 
System according to claim 10, characterised by an additional 
impedance (81) which, together with the attenuating beads (5) and the 

transmitter (8), correctly close, in terms of wave resistance, the or 
each node for push-push signals.
