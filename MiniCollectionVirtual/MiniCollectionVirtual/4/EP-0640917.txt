<ABSTRACT>
A roll call circuit for a semiconductor memory having a plurality 
of redundant memory cells, comprises a circuit for cutting off a path for 

transferring a memory cell information to an output pad at the time of a 
roll call test, and another circuit for transferring the result of the roll call 

test to the path so that the result of the roll call test is outputted from the 
output pad at the time of the roll call test.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a roll call circuit, and more
specifically to a roll call reading circuit for a semiconductor memory
having a plurality of redundant word lines or a plurality of redundant
column lines.Recent semiconductor memories are inclined to have a large storage
capacity, and therefore, have an increased number of word lines and
column lines. With this inclination, the recent semiconductor memories
have redundant word lines and redundant column lines for lowering a
fraction defective. Therefore, most of the semiconductor memories are
provided with a roll call circuit for discriminating use or non-use of each
redundant memory line (such as redundant word lines and redundant
column lines) at the time of evaluating a product and of analyzing a
defective product.Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a circuit diagram of one
example of the conventional roll call circuit. The shown conventional roll
call circuit includes a data-out buffer 12 for outputting data on an
input/output pad I/O, a data amplifier 17 for amplifying data on a pair of
complementary lines RWBST and RWBSN of an internal read/write bus 
so as to supply the amplified data to the data-out buffer 12, a sense
amplifier data reading circuit 16 receiving a memory cell data from a
sense amplifier (not shown in Figure 1) to supply the received memory
cell data to the pair of complementary lines RWBST and RWBSN, and a
roll call result reading circuit 15 for supplying a roll call discrimination
result to the pair of complementary lines RWBST and RWBSN.Furthermore, the shown conventional roll call circuit includes a
redundancy decoder 1 receiving internal address signals XADD1 to
XADD9 which correspond to an X address supplied to external address
input pins A1 to A9 (not shown), respectively. For example, if the X
address supplied to the address input pin A1 is "1", the signal XADD1 is
brought to a logical high level, or the X address supplied to the address
input pin A1 is "0" (zero), the signal XADD1 is brought to a logical low
level. Similarly, the signals XADD2 to XADD9 are brought to the logical
high level or the logical low level in accordance with the value of the X
address supplied to the address input pins A2 to A9, respectively. This
redundancy decoder 1 determines whether or not a redundancy word line
should be selected.The shown conventional roll call circuit also includes an X decoder
6 receiving the signals XADD1 to XADD9, an internal address signal
XADD0 brought to the logical high level or the logical low level
