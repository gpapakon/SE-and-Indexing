<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a germicidal-disinfectant
detergent composition comprising a cationic
germicide which provides sustained, high level
antibacterial activity, excellent germicidal-disinfectant
action, and excellent detergent action.EP-A-259249 discloses a microbicidal composition which may
contain germicides such as chlorinated phenols or phenyl
derivatives. Further several other common germicides are
mentioned. As regards the surfactant this document teaches
the use of anionic tensides, amphoteric tensides or nonionic
tensides. Chelates are mentioned as one example under
hundreds of solubilizing agents.DE-A-2416745 teaches that the washing effect of washing and
cleaning agents can be improved by combining cationic
ammonium type surfactants and a specific anionic surfactant
being the salt of an Î±-sulfo fatty acid ester. From the
general teaching of this document it becomes clear that it
does not relate to improving germicidal effects of cationic
germicides by adding complexing agent in a specific amount.
The examples 1 to 4 each for instance that it is sufficient
to combine a specific sulfo fatty acid ester salt with
cationic tensides without the addition of chelating agent to
obtain a bactericidal effect. Example 6 employs besides
anionic tenside and cationic tenside a fatty acid
diethanolamide which is no complexing agent. DE-A-2430245 relates to washing and cleaning compositions
wherein anionic and cationic tensides (having germicidal
activity) are combined. The teaching of this document does
not furnish any hints that the germicidal effects of
germicidal cations (in combination with anionic tensides) can
be improved by adding specific amounts of complexing (metal
chelating) agents. The examples 1 to 12 of this document show
that it is sufficient to combine a specific anionic tenside
with commonly used cationic tensides of ammonium type to
obtain the desired bactericidal effect. In example 14 a fatty
acid diethanolamide but no complexing agent is used.EP-A-268873 discloses a cleaning composition containing 10-40%
of a complexing aminopolycarboxylic acid. Further it
becomes clear from the general teaching of this document that
it does not aim at improving the germicidal effects of a
composition containing cationic germicides since as
comparative example a conventional technical cleaning
composition containing several inorganic cleaning agents (but
not cationic germicides) is mentioned.DE-A-2415981 relates to a disinfectant composition consisting
essentially of (a) 99.0-99.9% by weight
