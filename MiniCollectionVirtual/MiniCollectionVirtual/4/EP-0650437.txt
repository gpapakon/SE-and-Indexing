<ABSTRACT>
A system for forming a container (21) suitable for storage of flowable or non-flowable material, comprising the steps of forming an open container of flexible material having walls and a closed bottom with a retractable or removable framework (11) therein; at least partially filling the container (21) with material; removing or retracting said framework (11) from said container (21); closing the container (21); and subsequently over-wrapping the closed container (21) with stretch plastic film (16) to form reinforcing strips to reinforce the container (21), and to allow engagement with handling apparatus such as the forks of a lift truck.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the packaging of articles of any kind
particularly flowable granules, powders or liquids.The method or methods of the invention may be incorporated into fully
automated packaging lines.The invention is useful in the packaging of flowable granules such as
plastic granules, cereals, powders such as fertilisers or liquids as well as for
baling of waste materials with only minor modification being required.
Materials of all kinds including industrial, commercial and domestic waste
materials are currently handled in a variety of ways including use of plastic bags
which are difficult to handle if they are to be subject to exposure to liquids and/or
compacting of contents and includes intermediate bulk containers which are
usually filled with material such as fertilisers, cereal or plastic granules.
Furthermore such bags tend to be expensive and do not lend themselves to
recycling procedures.A packaging system of the present type has already been disclosed in
our co-pending International Patent Application No. PCT/AU92/00142 which is
hereby incorporated herein by cross reference.The present invention has as its objective to provide a bulk package and
packaging system in which the need for a solid base member or conventional
pallet base is dispensed with and the package can be handled by normal
handling machinery and methods.There is provided according to the present invention a method of forming
a bulk container comprising the steps of forming an open container of flexible
material having walls and a closed bottom with a retractable or removable
framework therein, at least partially filling the container with material, removing
or retracting said framework from said container, closing the container, and
subsequently over wrapping the closed container with stretch plastic film to form
reinforcing strips to reinforce the container and allow engagement with handling
apparatus such as the fork of a lift truck.In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a
method of forming a container comprising the steps of forming an open chamber 
of flexible material having walls and a closed bottom with a retractable or
removable framework therein acting to maintain the container volume open, at
least partially filling the container with material, removing or retracting said
framework from said container, wrapping said container and a spacer means
with flexible material to reinforce said container and secure said spacer means,
said spacer means being arranged and adapted to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a bulk container (21) comprising the steps of forming an
open container of flexible material having walls and a closed bottom with retractable

or removable framework (11) therein, at least partially filling the container with
material, removing or retracting said framework from said container and then

closing the container, 
characterised in that
 the closed container is subsequently
over-wrapped (at 22) with stretch plastic film (23) to form reinforcing strips (16,17)

to reinforce the container (21) and allow engagement with handling apparatus such
as the fork of a lift truck.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reinforcing film (23) is
preferably wrapped circumferentially around the container (21) end to end to form a

right-angular cross pattern.
A method of forming a bulk container as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein spacer means (20) is positioned against a face of the container (21) before

the over-wrapping step, which spacer means (20) is adapted and arranged to allow
engagement by a load handling apparatus, and in the over-wrapping step, said

spacer means (20) is secured to the container by the stretch plastic film (23).
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the spacer means (20) is provided
at either end of the container (21) between the end of the container and the stretch

plastic film (23).
A container when made by a method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4.
