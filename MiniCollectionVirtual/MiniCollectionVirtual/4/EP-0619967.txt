<ABSTRACT>
A modular reclining chair and method for assembling it are disclosed. 
The modular reclining chair includes a simplified actuation mechanism which 

significantly reduces system complexity and weight while providing improved comfort 
to the seat occupant. The construction is such that the pre-assembled actuation 

mechanism is integrally suspended from and interdependent with modular frame 
components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to reclining chairs and, more 
particularly, to a method for assembling an improved reclining chair from pre-assembled 
modular components. Traditionally, reclining chairs are equipped with an actuation mechanism 
which is operatively interconnected between a prefabricated chair frame and a 
stationary base assembly. In general, the actuation mechanism is a combination of 
various mechanical linkages operable for providing various comfort features such as 
independent reclining movement of a seat assembly as well as actuation of an 
extensible leg rest assembly. Due to its relative complexity, it is common practice in 
the furniture industry to assemble the various mechanical linkages of the actuation 
mechanism into a stand alone mechanism frame assembly. A prefabricated U-shaped 
chair frame is frequently bolted around the mechanism frame assembly with the open 
portion of the "U" corresponding to the front of the chair. In addition, the seat 
assembly is supported from the mechanism frame assembly for reclining movement 
with respect to the chair frame. Accordingly, such reclining chairs having a 
mechanism frame assembly within a wood chair frame are commonly referred to as 
having a "frame within a frame" construction. As such, most furniture manufacturers  
 
do not upholster the exterior surfaces of the prefabricated chair frame until after the 
mechanism frame assembly has been installed. Unfortunately, the upholstering 
operation is very inefficient and expensive in that the frequently heavy and 
cumbersome prefabricated chair frame must be manually manipulated in an extremely 
labor-intensive manner. Pursuant to traditional reclining chair construction technique, the free 
ends of the U-shaped frame are attached on opposite sides at the front of the 
mechanism frame assembly. However, the conventional mechanism frame assembly 
typically comprises a narrow rail as the front frame member in order to prevent 
interference with the pantograph linkage that protrudes from the front of the chair 
during extension and retraction of the leg rest member. Accordingly, due to the small 
connection surface between the free ends of the U-shaped chair frame and the front 
member of the mechanism frame assembly, the free ends of the U-shaped chair 
frame, which typically comprise chair arms, are susceptible to an undesirable degree 
of lateral deflection when side-to-side pressure is applied to the chair arms. While many conventional reclining chairs operate
