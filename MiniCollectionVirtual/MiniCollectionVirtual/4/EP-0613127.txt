<ABSTRACT>
A double-sided optical storage disk (31) comprises a single 
substrate having a microstructure formed on each side surface 

thereof. The microstructure is in the form of grooves or pits 
arranged in a spiral or concentric circles. Formed on each 

side surface of the substrate (110) are a reflective layer (120), and a 

transparent protective layer (150). The reflective layer is formed 
of aluminum alloy. The protective outer layer is formed of a 

transparent anti-corrosive material, specifically compatibly 
with an air-bearing, low-flying, read head, preferably 

silicon nitride.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to storage media for
disk drives, and more particularly, to optical read-only and
rewritable storage media.Like attics and garages, disk storage systems always
seem to be full. As technical development continuously moves
to greater storage capacities to keep pace with increased
demand, the construction and arrangement of the recording
media must likewise be improved.A conventional high capacity magnetic disk storage 
system typically includes a plurality of disks spaced axially
on a rotationally mounted spindle. Disk storage systems
attain high storage densities by utilizing the maximum number
of data surfaces for recording information within a given
volume. For example, an industry standard "5 1/4 inch"
(approximately 130 mm) disk storage system may store 600 MB
on five disks, each disk storing 60 MB on each of its two
surfaces. The number of disks that can be accommodated within
a given form factor, or industry standard dimensions are
limited by the height of the disk stack, the spacing between
the disks, and the thickness of the disks.Higher recording densities for optical media such as CDs
can also be achieved by decreasing the distance between the
read head and the storage media of the disk drive. Decreasing
the fly height of the read head allows for the reading of
data recorded at greater densities.However, when the fly height is decreased, the roughness
or asperity of the disk surfaces is a major concern. To
ensure reliable operation, asperities are generally
maintained at less than 60% of the head fly height. Likewise,
static build-up on the magnetic surface of the disk is kept
to a minimum to reduce static-friction ("stiction") which
would tend to interfere with the flying of the heads. Conventional optical storage systems have realized high
storage capacities by virtue of the fact that optical
recording techniques allow recording densities substantially
greater than those used with magnetic media. Optical storage
systems have evolved from write-once, read-only to systems
that have rewritable capabilities. The introduction of
magneto-optical ("M-O") media in particular, permits dynamic
and bit wise modification of information after it has been
initially recorded.In a typical M-O storage system information is recorded
on the media by directing a relatively intense, focused beam
of light through an optically transparent substrates
(substrate incident) at a small domain in a recording layer.
The recording layer is generally an amorphous, vertically
oriented,
