<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for measuring the concentration of ions in solutions, using ion-sensitive field-effect transistors. The circuit proposed can be used to determine the threshold-voltage difference between two ISFETs directly, and independently of design tolerances, operation-related parameter fluctuations and environmental influences. The circuit consists of two amplifiers (1, 2) each with two ISFETs (4, 5 and 10, 11) of different or equal sensitivities and two identical FETs (3, 6 and 9, 12) which are connected up in such a way that the difference between the mean value of the two ISFET threshold voltages and the FET threshold voltage is applied to the output of the first amplifier and the difference between the two ISFET threshold voltages is applied to the output of the second amplifier, the output of the first amplifier being connected to the common reference electrode (16) of the four ISFETs.
