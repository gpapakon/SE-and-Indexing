<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method of controlling undesired 
plant growth employing co-application of dimethenamid and at 
least one other herbicide from the group of triketones, herbicidal 
compositions comprising dimethenamid and at least one other 
herbicide from the group of triketones and the use of such compositions 
in controlling undesired plant growth. Dimethenamid (FRONTIERÂ®) whose chemical name is 2-chloro-N-(2,4-dimethyl-3-thienyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)-acetamide, 
processes for its production, herbicidal compositions containing 
it and its use as a herbicide are described in US Patent 
4,666,502 the contents of which are incorporated herein by 
reference. Dimethenamid consists of 4 stereoisomers due to two 
chiral elements and can thus also exist in the form of the 
individual isomers as diastereomeric mixtures (1S, aRS (known as 
S-dimethenamid) and 1R, aRS (known as R-dimethenamid)) and as a 
racemic mixture (1RS, aRS). References herein to dimethenamid 
refer to its various forms unless otherwise stated. Of the 
diastereomeric mixtures S-dimethenamid is preferred. The term herbicides, as used herein, refers to compounds which 
combat or control undesired plant growth. This class of compounds 
may be divided into sub-classes according to the primary type or 
mode of action the herbicide has on the plant. For example 
according to G.F. Warren of Purdue University, Indiana, USA, 
herbicides can be classified as auxin transport inhibitors, 
growth regulator herbicides, photosynthesis inhibitors, pigment 
inhibitors, growth inhibitors, amino acid synthesis inhibitors, 
lipid biosynthesis inhibitors, cell wall biosynthesis inhibitors, 
rapid cell membrane disruptors as well as "miscellaneous" herbicides 
which do not come under one of the preceding categories. It has now surprisingly been found that co-application of  
 
dimethenamid and at least one other herbicide from the group of 
triketones results in better and in some cases longer-lasting 
control of undesired plant growth. This synergistic effect 
exhibits itself in a high degree of control at co-application 
rates which are significantly lower than the rate of each 
individual compound required to obtain the same degree of 
control. Furthermore, at any given co-application rate the degree 
of control is higher than the additive effect obtained for the 
individual components at the same rate. In some cases both speed 
of activity and level of control are enhanced and/or weeds can be 
controlled which are not controlled by
