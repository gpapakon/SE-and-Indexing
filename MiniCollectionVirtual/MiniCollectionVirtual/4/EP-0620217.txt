A process for the preparation of a 4-methylpyrimidine 
of the formula I 


 
where R¹ is C₁-C₂₀-alkyl, C₃-C₈-cycloalkyl, aryl, C₇-C₁₂-phenalkyl, 

C₇-C₁₂-alkylphenyl, NH₂, NHCN, OH or SH,
 
wherein a 1-aminovinyl methyl ketone of the formula II 


 
where R² and R³ are each C₁-C₂₀-alkyl, C₃-C₈-cycloalkyl, 

aryl, C₇-C₁₂-phenylalkyl, C₇-C₁₂-alkylphenyl or C₁-C₂₀-hydroxyalkyl 
or together are a C₂-C₇-alkylene chain which 

is unsubstituted or monosubstituted to tetrasubstituted 
by C₁-C₄-alkyl and may be interrupted by oxygen, nitrogen 

or sulfur,
 
is reacted with a carboxamide or an amidine or a salt 

thereof of the formula III 

 
where R¹ has the abovementioned meanings and X is oxygen  

 
or NH, at from 20 to 200°C and from 0.01 to 50 bar. 
A process for the preparation of a 4-methylpyrimidine 
I as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 1-aminovinyl 

methyl ketone II is obtained from diacetylene and 
a secondary amine by 


a) separating a part-stream which contains diacetylene 
of the formula IV 


H-C≡C-C≡C-H
 
by absorption from the crack gas resulting from the 

production of acetylene and 
b) reacting this part-stream with a secondary amine of 
the formula 


 
where R² and R³ have the abovementioned meanings, 

and water, if required in a diluent, at from 0 to 
150°C and from 0.01 to 5 bar. 
A process for the preparation of a 4-methylpyrimidine 
I as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reaction 

is carried out at from 40 to 180°C.
