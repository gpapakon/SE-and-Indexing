<ABSTRACT>
A system and method involving a statistical conditioning technique that improves the coding 
efficiency in compression systems which have unstable statistical properties by conditioning 

the probability estimate for a given model context on prior decisions for that 
context thus enlarging the conditioning decision set. Instead of extending the model context 

by increasing the range of prior decisions in the pixel neighborhood, each model context 
is expanded into a set of two contexts which are the actual coding contexts. For a 

given probability estimation model context, the selection of a coding context index is done 
on the basis of the previous coding decision (1 or 0) for that model context. Thus, if a 

model context is assigned an index A, the coding context would be assigned an index 

2*A 
+ D(A)' 
 
, where D(A)' is the previous (immediately preceding) binary decision for model 

context A; the decision of which coding context to use turns on whether the model context 
was used most recently for coding a 1 or a 0. More generally, each model context index 

A is expanded into a set of 2**N coding context indices, where N is the number of previous 
decisions for model context index A used in the conditioning of, for example, an arithmetic 

coding decision. The addressing of the context expansion can be done in any way which 
expands the total number of contexts by a factor of 2**N. The index for a case where the 

expansion is by one decision bit may be 

2*A + D(A)' 
 
, whereas in the case where the expansion 

is by two decision bits the index may be 

4*A + 2*D(A)' + D(A)'' 
 
.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data compression and more particularly to a system and 
method for the conditioning of a probability estimate for a given model context on prior 
decisions for that context when dealing with unstable model statistics. Coding systems with simple statistical models sometimes have problems with unstable statistical 
estimates. For example, the well-known ABIC 7-pel template model (see the November, 
1988 issue of the IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) 
exhibits this kind of behavior. It is very effective for compression of both text documents 
and binary halftone images. However, experiments with the Q-Coder probability estmation 
scheme (again see IBM JRD November, 1988) have shown that for the ABIC 
model the probability estimates are not always stable, but that significant compression 
improvements can be obtained by using a more complex multi-rate adaptation scheme (see 
U.S.Pat.No.4,935,882, to PENNEBAKER AND MITCHELL). Still, the estimation 
state machine of this multi-rate scheme is quite complex. Hence, a simpler technique would 
be desirable to achieve efficient coding when unstable statistical estimates are encountered 
by various models for compression. Adaptive binary arithmetic coders such as the Q-Coder. (see U.S.Pat.No.4,905,297, to 
LANGDON, MITCHELL, PENNEBAKER AND RISSANEN), or the lineal 
descendent of the Q-Coder used in the emerging ISO JPEG/JBIG image compression 
standards (e.g., ISO DIS 10918-1, CCITT Recommendation T.81 - see "JPEG Still Image 
Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, Van 
Nostrand Reinhold, 1993 ISBN 0-442-01272-1), imbed a dynamic probability estimation  
 
process into the coding procedures. Each coding system incorporates a statistical model 
which describes how each coding decision is "conditioned" on prior coding decisions. The 
statistical models used with the coders work best when the probability estimates are slowly 
varying or stable. Then, once the learning stage is complete, the estimates are quite accurate, 
and coding efficiencies are nearly optimum. However, if the probabilities are sufficiently 
unstable so that the coder cannot maintain an accurate probability estimate, the 
coding efficiency suffers. One approach to achieving at least a partial solution to this problem is to try by some 
means to detect that the estimate is poor, and when this is detected, adapt to new estimates 
more quickly. For example, unstable probability estimates are detected in the above-mentioned 
mult
