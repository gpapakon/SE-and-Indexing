<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a book
binding apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1, and
more particularly, it relates to a book binding
apparatus in which imaged sheets are bookbound as a
book and which is applicable to an on-line system
wherein a plurality of image forming apparatuses
required for forming images on sheets successively, a
book binding apparatus for bookbinding the sheets
on which the images were formed and a sorting and
containing apparatus for sorting and containing the
bookbound sheet bundles are interconnected. The present invention
relates to an image forming apparatus having such a
book binding apparatus.In the past, when a plurality of sheets on
which images were formed are automatically glue-bound
to obtain a book, an on-line system wherein a
plurality of apparatus required for performing such
jobs are interconnected has been used. For example,
the on-line system includes (1) a reading and sheet
supplying apparatus comprising an original setting
portion for setting an original, an optical system
for scanning the original, and a sheet supplying 
apparatus for containing a number of sheets and for
supplying the sheet, (2) an image forming apparatus
for forming an image on the sheet supplied from the
sheet supplying apparatus, (3) a book binding
apparatus for bookbinding the sheets on which the
images were formed, and (4) a sheet sorting and
containing apparatus for sorting and containing the
book bound or finished sheet bundles or the sheets.
These apparatuses are interconnected in series.When the sheet boundle is bookbound in the
book binding apparatus, the sheet bundle aligned in
a sheet align tray is glue-bound by a gluing binder.
A bind tape used with the gluing binder comprises a
tape-shaped sheet on which paste or glue of hot melt
type is coated. The bind tape is abutted against the
sheet bundle and is adhered to the sheet bundle by
melting the glue by a heater.In the conventional book binding apparatus of
the on-line system including the image forming
apparatus, a sheet entrance portion, a sheet bundle
aligning means, a convey means and a stacker are
arranged in series, and the convey means is of
handling type. According to this handling type, in
bookbinding the sheet bundle, the sheets successively
entered from the sheet entrance portion are aligned
in the aligning means as a sheet bundle, and then the
bind tape is abutted against the sheet bundle and is 
heated by the heater to bookbind the sheet bundle,
and the bookbound sheet bundle is contained in the
stacker

<CLAIMS>
A book binding apparatus comprising

a sheet entrance portion (19a) for receiving a sheet
(S);
a sheet convey path (19) for conveying the sheet from
said first sheet entrance portion (19a) to a

first discharge opening (19b) disposed
downstream of said sheet convey path (19) for

discharging the sheet (S) to the outside of the
apparatus;
sheet storing means (41, 42; 341) for temporarily
storing the sheet (S);
branching means (36, 37) for branching the sheets
from said sheet convey path (19);
