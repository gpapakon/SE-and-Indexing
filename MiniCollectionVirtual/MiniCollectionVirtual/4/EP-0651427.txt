<ABSTRACT>
A plasma processing device is described which is modular and can be scaled up by 
assembly together with similar devices to provide a capability for large area processing. 

The device includes a housing which contains an array of RF coils and into which a 
process gas is fed. The article to be processed is disposed close to the housing and 

egress of the process gas from the housing to the process region is resisted so as to 
maintain a positive pressure differential between the housing and the process region.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plasma processing and, more particularly, to a module 
for mounting within a process chamber (equipped with a vacuum system) for the 
purpose of plasma processing of insulating materials. Plasma processing typically 
involves deposition of material onto substrate surfaces or the etching/modification of 
those surfaces, but can involve other operations either additionally to or alternatively 
to such operations. It is known, for example from United States Patent No 4,948,458, that a spiral 
electrode mounted on the outside of an insulating wall of a vacuum system is suitable 
for performing plasma etching through inductive coupling. However, difficulties with 
the scale-up to larger processing areas have been reported due to the size of the 
inductance required. This is in addition to the usual scale-up problem of process 
parameters depending strongly on chamber geometry due to the effects of walls, flow 
patterns of reactive gases etc. An object of this invention is to address these problems 
through the use of module(s) consisting of a number of small coils; each module being 
optimised for uniform plasma generation and containing an integral gas feed supply. Another object of this invention is to provide a plasma processing device 
utilising inductive coupling which has advantages over conventional arrangements due 
to its inherent modularity which allows easy scale-up from laboratory to commercial 
sizes. Each module consists of several coils arranged for plasma uniformity, with 
power and gas feeds. According to the invention there is provided a plasma processing device 
comprising a housing with a wall member overlying a substrate to be operated on by 
means of a plasma process but separated therefrom by a discharge gap, the device 
comprising a plurality of inductive coils distributed over said wall member, means for 
supplying RF energy to the coils, means for introducing a process gas into said housing 
and causing said gas to flow into the discharge gap, said wall member and/or said 
housing being constructed to resist the flow of said gas so as to maintain in said 
housing a higher pressure of said gas than exists in said discharge gap. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, 
with reference to the accompanying drawings of which: Figure 1 shows schematically 
an arrangement for a processing module, and
 
 
   Figures 2, 3 and 4 show a second embodiment of the invention. Referring to Figure 1, the module takes the form of a box 1
