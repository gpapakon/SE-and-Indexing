<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of constructing a building facade, in the case of which method a masonry wall or other structure parts is/are first of all constructed from aerated-concrete blocks by a thin bed mortar process and, if appropriate, the facade wall (10), or the structure parts, is/are filled over the entire surface area on the outside, and, in a next step, after the filler has dried, the facade wall (10) or the structure parts is/are machined mechanically to produce the desired structures, for example by milling in joints (11, 12), and, in a final step, the facade wall which has been machined in this manner is provided with a thin layer of a coating material. The purpose of the method according to the invention is to construct a decorative facade with, for example, oblique joints (14), purpose-made blocks or decorations in a simple manner without cost-intensive labour.

Method of constructing a building facade or other parts
of a building in which in the first instance a facade wall

or another building part is made from bricks of cellular
concrete by the thin layer mortar method and then, if

required, the façade wall or the building parts are primed
or coated at the whole face of the outer side, i.e. on

the side of view, in the next step after drying of the
priming or coating material this material and the underlying

façade wall or the building parts are worked mechanically
for producing the desired structures, for example by

cutting or grinding, and in a final step, the façade wall
or the building parts worked in this manner are provided

with a thin layer of a coating material which is applied
like a painting material.
Method of constructing a building façade or parts of a
building as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that in

the mechanical working step grooves are cut in the façade
wall.
Method of constructing a building façade or parts of a
building as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in

that in the mechanical working step incremental areas
of the bricks are grinded to form sectional bricks (15)

with inclined faces (15a) or are rounded.
Method of constructing a building façade or parts of a
building as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised

in that in the mechanical working step embossed
ornamental structures (22) are produced by cutting recesses.
Method of constructing a building façade or parts of a
building as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised

in that in the region of a window lintel sloping 
grooves (14) are cut which are symmetrical relative to

the middle of the window.
Method of constructing a building façade or parts of a
building as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised

in that individual cellular concrete brick elements
are adhered to the vertical plane of the façade wall or

the building part by means of thin layer mortar or flexible
adhesive which are coated thereafter.
Method of constructing a building façade or parts of a
building as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised

in that a base plaster of cement lime is applied
at first when the cellular concrete brick elements are

attached to an underground of another stone material.
Method of constructing a building façade or parts of a
building as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised

in that constructional elements of cellular concrete,
as for example arched elements, columns, entry portals,

wall niches or the like prefabricated by preceding mechanical
treatment are attached to a façade wall or in

front of a part of a building.
