<ABSTRACT>
The cell type of a battery (82) is determined 
by characterizing the series resistance behavior of 

various cell types to determine ranges (40, 48) of 
series resistance values exhibited by batteries of a 

particular cell type. The series resistance of a 
battery (82) of unknown cell type is then measured. If 

the series resistance measurement is determined to be 
within a range (40, 48) of series resistance values 

exhibited exclusively by a cell type, the battery is 
identified as having that cell type. However, for 

batteries whose series resistance measurements are 
within a non-exclusive range (52) of series resistance 

values, a second cell type discharge characteristic 
such as battery voltage is also characterized to 

differentiate between the cell types. The second 
discharge characteristic of these batteries is also 

measured and used to identify the cell type.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit and
method for identifying the cell type of a battery, and
more particularly relates to a circuit and method for
identifying a battery's cell type while in circuit and
operating.Batteries using various cell technologies
(cell types) have been developed and are in widespread
use. Two of the most common cell types are alkaline
and nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd). Other cell types include
nickel-metal-hydride and various lithium technologies.
In many applications, batteries of differing cell types
are interchangeable. For example, in many household
electronic products such as calculators, palmtop
computers and the like, both alkaline and Ni-Cd type
batteries can be used.In some circumstances, however, it is
necessary to differentiate between the cell types of
the batteries being used in a particular application.
For example, in some palmtop computers, an end-of-life
or state-of-charge procedure is used to gauge the
remaining energy in the battery and provide an
indication of same to the user. Typically, these
procedures are dependent on the voltage characteristic
of the battery over its discharge cycle. Because the
voltage characteristic of batteries differs between
cell types, the cell type of the battery must be known
to accurately gauge the remaining battery energy. If a 
battery is compared to a voltage characteristic of
another cell type, the measurement of the remaining
energy will be in error. Improper cell type usage
could result in the diagnosis of a fully charged
battery as having insufficient remaining charge. The
user might prematurely discard or unnecessarily
recharge such a misdiagnosed battery. Improper cell
type usage could also result in failing to diagnose the
impending end of life of a battery with little
remaining charge. The user, relying on such diagnosis,
could lose valuable data on the eventual failure of the
battery.Cell type differentiation is also critical to
battery recharging. Some cell types, such as Ni-Cd,
are rechargeable, while others, such as alkaline, are
not. If a recharging current is applied to a non-rechargeable
battery, the temperature of the battery
increases rapidly as does the internal pressure.
Eventually, if recharging is continued, the battery
will vent, resulting in leakage of caustic chemicals
from the battery and possibly an explosion.Currently, many battery operated products
simply rely on the user as directed by an owner's
manual or warnings attached to the battery operated
product to select and employ batteries of the
