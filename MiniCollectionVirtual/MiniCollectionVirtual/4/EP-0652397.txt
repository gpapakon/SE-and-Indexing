<ABSTRACT>
A connector device for a fluid circuit includes a tube 
(16) of elastomeric material and at least one clamping 

member (24) having an annular portion (26) and means (28, 
30) for varying the diameter of the annular portion (26). 

In its external surface, adjacent at least one end 
portion (34), the tube (16) has a circumferential groove 

(20) and the diameter of the annular portion (26) of the 
clamping member (24), even in its loose condition, is 

slightly smaller than that of the portions of the tube 
(16) adjacent the groove (20) into which the annular 

portion (26) of the clamping member (24) may be fitted. 
Apparatus for manufacturing the tube (16) includes: a 
shaped core (46) around which the tube (16) may be fitted 

coaxially and at least one mould (48) for positioning 
coaxially around one end (50) of the core (46) and which

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector device for
fluid circuits, and to an apparatus and a method for its
manufacture.Such a device is used in particular in the cooling
circuit of an internal combustion engine and includes a
tube of elastomeric material and at least one annular
clamping member provided with means enabling the diameter
of the member to be varied.During the mounting of prior art devices of the type
described above, once one end of the tube has been fitted
onto the union of another component of the circuit, the
clamping ember is fitted around this end of the tube and
then tightened, so as to avoid any leakage of fluid
between the tube and the union.In the prior art, such operations are carried out by
conveying tubes and clamping members separately to an
assembly station and then joining them together, thus
incurring appreciable storage and assembly costs. EP-A-631 080 (which is a prior art document under Art.
54(3) (4) EPC) discloses a connector device for a fluid circuit,
including a tube with a circumferential groove in its
outer surface adjacent at least one end portion and a clamping
member to be positioned in the groove.A pin protrudes from a portion of the bottom of the groove
and the clamping member is provided with a hole, so that the
clamping member is retained, even in its loose state, in the
groove by the engagement between the pin and the hole. The
provision of the pin and the hole is however expensive.In order to overcome these disadvantages, the subject of the
present invention is a device of the type described at the
beginning of the present description 
and characterised in that the tube has a
circumferential groove in its outer surface adjacent at
least one end portion, and in that, even in its loose
state, the diameter of the annular portion of the
clamping member is slightly smaller than that of the
portions of the tube adjacent the groove, into which the
annular portion of the clamping member can be inserted,
thus determining the axial position of the clamping
member relative to the tube.The device according to the invention can thus be stored
and subsequently conveyed to an assembly station as a
single, pre-assembled item, in which the annular portion
of the clamping member is loose in the groove in the
tube.In this way a correct axial positioning of the clamping
member on the tube is ensured, avoiding that the person
responsible for mounting the tube onto the union and
tightening the clamping member should either waste time
having to rectify the position of the

<CLAIMS>
A connector device for a fluid circuit, in
particular for the cooling circuit of an internal

combustion engine (10), including a tube (16) of
elastomeric material and at least one clamping member

groove (20) in its outer surface adjacent at least one
end portion (34) and in that the diameter of the annular

portion (26) of the clamping member (24), even in its
loose state, is slightly smaller than that of the

portions of the tube (16) adjacent the groove (20) into
which the annular portion (26) of the clamping member

(24) can be fitted thereby determining the axial position
of the clamping member (24) relative to the tube (16).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the end portion (34) of the tube (16) adjacent the groove

(20) is shaped like a truncated cone with its larger base
(36) facing the groove (20) and its smaller base (38)

formed with the mouth (40) of the tube (16).
A device according to Claim 2, characterised in that
the diameter of the larger base (36) is greater than the 

diameter of the annular portion (26) of the clamping member
(24) in its loose state, while the diameter of the smaller

base (38) is less than the diameter of the annular portion
(26) of the clamping member (24) in its loose state.
A device according to either Claim 2 or Claim 3, characterised
in that the intermediate portion (42) of the tube

(16) immediately adjacent the groove (20) is shaped like a
truncated cone, the larger base (44) of which faces the

groove (20) and has a greater diameter than that of the

loose state.
Apparatus for the manufacture of a tube (16) which
forms part of the device of Claims 1 to 4 comprising also

a shaped core (46) around which the tube (16) may be
fitted coaxially, and
at least one mould (48) for positioning coaxially
around the outside of one end (50) of the core (46) encased

by the tube (16) and which reproduces in negative (55) the
desired shape of the external surface of the tube (16),

which has a circumferential groove (20) adjacent at least
one end portion (34) thereof, the clamping member (24) being

forced to slide onto the end portion (34) of the manufactured
tube (16) thanks to the resilient deformability of this

latter, and fitted into the groove (20) where it is held and

have respective circumferential projections (74) which 
form a continuous retaining ring for the clip (72) when the

mould (48) is in its closed configuration.
A method for the manufacture of a tube (16) which forms
part of the device of Claims 1 to 4 comprising also a clamping

member 24, characterised in that it includes the steps
of:


coaxially fitting the raw tube (16) around the core
