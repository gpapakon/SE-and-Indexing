<ABSTRACT>
A method of removing fines from beer comprises 
adding to the beer an aqueous solution containing gellan 

gum and gelatin. A dry blend of gellan gum and gelatin 
suitable for use as a fining agent to prepare the aqueous 

solution also is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
beverage industry. More particularly, it relates to a 
method and agents for removing particulate protein 
material commonly referred to as "fines" from malt 
beverages or wines. Fining agents are materials which are added to 
beverages, such as malt beverages and wines, to clarify 
the beverages and/or to ease the filtration of the 
beverage by precipation of proteins and other insoluble 
materials. In the brewing of beer, malt and unmalted adjuncts 
are extracted with water at suitable temperatures for a 
proper length of time to obtain a solution called wort. 
The wort is boiled and passed through some type of 
strainer (for example, a filter, hop-back, whirlpool) in 
order to remove solids (or trub). The wort is then 
cooled for fermentation (for example; a temperature of 
47°F may be used for yeast addition). The cooled wort is 
then pitched with the proper amount of yeast. After the 
first 24 hours the fermentation is established and 
proceeds at an accelerated rate. The temperature of the 
fermenting wort increases and must thus be controlled to 
maintain yeast viability. Once the yeast has utilized 
the fermentable substances in the wort (usually after 7 
to 10 days), the temperature is reduced and the yeast 
begins to settle. The yeast which has settled out during 
fermentation and cooling (in most cases) is then 
recovered in order to be used for pitching subsequent  
 
brews. During the most active phase of wort fermentation 
large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) gas are liberated. 
Many breweries have CO₂ collection systems which collect, 
purify, and compress the gas for later use in beer 
carbonation. The resultant "green" beer ("ruh" beer or fermented 
wort) is pumped into a "ruh" or storage tank where its 
temperature is further reduced (about 36°F or below). At 
this time, during beer transfer, the addition of fining 
agents (such as isinglass, gelatin, etc.) are made in 
order to shorten the processing time. During this 
initial storage (ruh) period proteinaceous materials, 
yeast, and other solids are precipitated. Precipitation 
is enhanced by the presence of fining agents. This 
initial time period may vary depending on several factors 
which may include: type of beer, dosing rates and 
effectiveness of fining agents (if any are employed), 
solids level in the beer, and brewery output and beer 
demand. The "ruh" beer can subsequently be transferred 
to maturation (conditioning) tanks where upon further 
settling of remaining yeast and

<CLAIMS>
A method of removing fines from beer in the brewing 
process, said method comprising: 


(a) preparing an aqueous solution of a blend 
comprising by weight about 2.5 % to about 50 % 

gellan gum and about 45 % to about 95 % gelatin; 
(b) adding an amount of said solution to a ruh beer to 
obtain a concentration of gellan gum of about 0.25 

to about 60 ppm and a concentration of gelatin of 
about 4.5 to about 115 ppm; 
(c) storing the thus treated ruh beer for at least 
about 24 hrs; and 
(d) then decanting and filtering said ruh beer. 
A method of claim 1 in which a sequestering agent 
is added to the aqueous solution. 
A method of claim 2 in which the sequestering agent 
is sodium citrate. 
A method of claim 2 in which the sequestering agent 
is tetrasodium pyrophosphate. 
A method of one of claims 1 to 4 in which the 
gelatin is 250 bloom gelatin. 
A fining agent for use in a ruh beer comprising: 

(a) about 2.5 % to about 50 % by weight of gellan gum; 
and 
(b) about 45 % to about 95 % by weight of gelatin. 
A fining agent of claim 6 which also contains an 
effective amount of a sequestering agent to combine 

with any metallic ions that might be present in the 
ruh beer and might interfere with the desired 

action of the gellan gum and gelatin. 
A fining agent of claim 7 in which the sequestering 
agent is sodium citrate. 
A fining agent of claim 7 in which the sequestering 
agent is tetrasodium pyrophosphate. 
A fining agent of one of claims 6 to 9 in which the 
gelatin is 250 bloom gelatin.
