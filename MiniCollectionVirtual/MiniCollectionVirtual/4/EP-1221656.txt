<ABSTRACT>
A storage device 5 stores a Web page template 11 defining the basic
structure of Web pages to be browsed, and registered user information 12

including information regarding users who will browse the Web pages. A
Web page generating unit 6 generates, in response to a request from a

user for browsing a Web page, a Web page specific to the user by
embedding user-specific information which is obtained by referencing the

registered user information 12 into the Web page template 11. A server
unit 7 provides the generated user-specific Web page to the user.
The storage area for storing Web pages on a server can be saved.
In addition, the number of stored Web pages is small
, facilitating the
maintenance of the Web pages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Web page transmission system and
transmission method which are suitable for providing user-specific Web
pages on a user-by-user basis via a network.Various information are made public in the form of Web pages on
networks such as the Internet. The Web pages include pages which are
allowed to be freely browsed by anyone, and pages which are allowed to
be browsed only by specific users. In response to a browsing request
for a Web page which is allowed to be browsed only by a specific user; a
server requests the user to enter a user code and a password, and if the
user code and the password having been entered are found to have been
registered on the server, it permits the browsing of the corresponding
Web page.The conventional art described above has involved the following
problems to be solved. The Web pages provided by the server include
those common to all users and those specific to each user. For example,
when Web pages for product quote are provided to customers, different
wholesale prices may be set for the same product on a customer-by-customer
basis. For example, the wholesale price for a customer A is
set to be 10,000 yen, and the wholesale price for a customer B is set to
be 9,500 yen. In such a case, the server prepares Web pages specific to
each of the users, storing each of the Web pages in a storage device. 
When user authentication is complete, a corresponding user-specific Web
page is retrieved from the storage device using the user code as a key,
and the browsing thereof is permitted.However, as the number of the users increases, the user-specific
Web pages increase. This causes the problem that the storage capacity
of the storage device for storing the user-specific Web pages needs to
be infinitely increased as the number of the users increases.
Furthermore, if any change is made to information included in the Web
pages, the work of individually modifying all the user-specific Web
pages is required, incurring the problem that the load of such
maintenance also increases as the quantity of the user-specific Web
pages increases.In order to solve the above problems, the present invention employs
the following schemes.A Web page transmission system characterized by comprising a
storage device for storing a Web page template defining the basic
structure of Web pages to be browsed, and registered user information
regarding registered users who browse the Web pages; a Web page
generating unit for generating, in response to a request for browsing
the Web page
