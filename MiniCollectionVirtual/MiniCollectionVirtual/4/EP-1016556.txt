<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle tyre (1) comprises a tread provided with a
tread pattern (2S) made up of circumferentially

arranged design units (4) having a plurality of
pitch lengths Pi (i=1 to j) including a minimum

pitch length Pl and a maximum pitch length Pj, each
of the design units (4) comprising at least one

groove (3,5) having side walls (Gw) each having an
inclination angle αi in a cross section parallel to

the tyre equator (CO), and the inclination angle α1
in the design unit having the minimum pitch length

P1 is less than the inclination angle αj in the
design unit having the maximum pitch length Pj,

whereby the rigidity difference between the design
units (4) having different pitch lengths is

decreased. Preferably, the angle αi in a design
unit having a pitch length Pi is not more than the

angle αi+1 in a design unit having the next longer
pitch length Pi+1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle tyre
having an improved tread portion in which the
rigidity difference between tread pattern design
units having different pitch lengths is decreased to
improve the tyre uniformity, steering stability and
the like.In general, a pneumatic tyre is provided in the
tread with a tread pattern formed by repeating a
design unit along the circumference of the tyre, and
most of the tread patterns employ variable pitches
in arranging the design unit. JP-A- 63-57304, which
corresponds to the preamble of claim 1, shows such a tyre.If the circumferential widths of grooves in every
design unit are varied in proportion to the pitches,
the sea/land ratio or the ratio of the grooved area
to the remaining area is made even through all the
design units, and as a result the ground pressure
distribution of the tyre becomes uniform. Thus this
does not seem to involve problems. In fact,
however, it is difficult to improve the tyre 
uniformity, running noise, steering stability and
the like. Therefore, the present inventor studied
and found that the pattern rigidity of the design
unit is not always made even although the ground
pressure distribution is even.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a pneumatic tyre in which the design
units are made even or uniform in pattern rigidity
to improve the tyre uniformity, steering stability,
running noise and the like without worsening the
ground pressure distribution.According to the present invention, a vehicle tyre
comprises a tread provided with a tread pattern made
up of circumferentially arranged design units, the
design units having a plurality of pitch lengths Pi
(i=1 to j) including a minimum pitch length P1 and a
maximum pitch length Pj, each of the design units
comprising at least one groove having side walls
each having an inclination angle αi in a cross
section parallel to the tyre equator, and the
inclination angle α1 in the design unit having the 
minimum pitch length P1 which is less than the
inclination angle αj in the design unit having the
maximum pitch length Pj.An embodiment of the present invention will now be
described in detail in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings in which:-
Fig. 1 shows a tread pattern according to the
present invention;Fig. 2 shows a design unit forming the tread
pattern;Figs. 3(A)-3(E) are cross sectional views
showing the inclination angles of groove side walls
at corresponding positions of design units having
different pitch lengths;Fig. 4 shows parts of a tyre
