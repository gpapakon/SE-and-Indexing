<ABSTRACT>
A wavelength conversion device is formed by adding a 
laser-active material to a nonlinear optical crystal, and 

creating a phase-matching structure in the crystal. Light 
of a first wavelength excites the laser-active materi
al, 
generating laser light of a second wavelength. Nonlinear 

optical effects then generate further wavelengths, such as 
the second harmonic of the first wavelength, the second 

harmonic of the second wavelength, the sum frequency of the 
first and second wavelengths, and the difference frequency 

of the first and second wavelengths. Multiple output 
wavelengths are thereby obtained from a single input 

wavelength. Because of the phase matching structure, the 
output is aligned in the same direction as the input light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device that converts 
coherent input light, such as light from a semiconductor 
laser diode, to output light differing in wavelength from 
the input light. There is considerable interest in converting light 
from, for example, the red or infrared wavelengths emitted 
by semiconductor laser diodes to shorter visible 
wavelengths. One known method of effecting such a 
conversion is to input coherent light into a nonlinear 
optical crystal, which generates light with twice the 
frequency (half the wavelength) of the input light. This 
process is referred to as second-harmonic generation (SHG). 
If two different wavelengths are input, the nonlinear 
optical crystal may generate light with the sum or 
difference of the two input frequencies, a process known as 
sum-frequency generation (SFG) or difference-frequency 
generation (DFG). SHG, SFG, and DFG depend on energy 
conservation law and certain phase-matching conditions, as 
will be described below. FIG. 1 shows an apparatus that is disclosed in Yamamoto  
 
et al., "Simultaneous sum-frequency and second-harmonic 
generation from a proton-exchange MgO-doped LiNbO₃ 
waveguide," Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 58, No. 12 (25 
March 1991), pp. 1227-1229, and has been used to generate 
red, green, and blue output light from input light with two 
infrared wavelengths. The wavelength conversion device 10 
comprises a lithium-niobate (LiNbO₃) substrate 11 doped with 
magnesium oxide (MgO), on which an optical waveguide 13 is 
formed by the proton-exchange method, using pyrophosphoric 
acid (H₄P₂O₇). Two semiconductor laser diodes 15a and 15b 
generate beams of infrared light with wavelengths of 
0.86 µm (λ₁) and 1.3 µm (λ₂), which are combined by a 
dichroic mirror 17. A mirror 19 reflects the beam from 
laser diode 15b to the dichroic mirror 17. Lenses 21a and 
21b focus the beams from the laser diodes, and a third lens 
23 directs the mixed beam from the dichroic mirror 17 into 
the waveguide 13. In the waveguide 13, nonlinear optical 
effects generate light of wavelengths 0.43 µm (λ₃, the 
second harmonic of λ₁), 0.65 µm (λ₄, the second harmonic 
of λ₂), and 0.52 µm (λ₅, the sum frequency of λ₁ and 
λ₂). The mathematical relationships between the input 
wavelengths (λ₁, λ₂) and output wavelengths (λ₃, λ₄, 
λ₅) are:  λ₃ = λ₁/2 λ₄ = λ₂/2 λ₅⁻¹ = λ₁⁻¹ + λ₂⁻¹ If the wave vectors of the light of wavelengths λ₁, λ₂, 
λ₃, λ₄, and λ₅ are k₁, k₂, k₃, k₄, and k₅, then the 
necessary phase-matching conditions are: 
k₃ = 2k₁ k₄ = 2k₂ k₅ =
