<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the platelet
surface glycoprotein referred to as GPIIIa, and more
particularly to tertiary structure-dependent antigen
denominated PlA that is part of the GPIIIa molecule,
their preparation and use.The platelet antigen system, PlA, is
associated with two clinical syndromes, neonatal
alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) and posttranfusion
purpura (PTP) [Aster, The immunologic thrombocytopenias,
Kunicki and George, eds., Platelet Immunobiology, 387,
Philadelphia, PA (1989)]. NAIT is a bleeding disorder
of newborns with increased platelet destruction caused
by tranplacentally transfered maternal platelet specific
antibodies and is estimated to occur at a frequency of
1/1,000 births [Blanchette et al., Curr. Stud. Hematol.
Blood Tranf., 52:87 (1986)]. PTP is an antibody-mediated
thrombocytopenia in response to platelet
incompatibility following a blood tranfusion. The most
common cause of both NAIT and PTP in the Caucasian
population is the plA1 alloantigen.The alloantigenic determinant responsible for
eliciting anti-plA1 antibodies is present on the
platelet membrane GPIIIa [Kunicki et al, Mol. Immunol.,
16:353 (1979)]. The plA1 and plA2 phenotypes are
dependent on the presence of a thymidine (T) or cytidine
(C), respectively, at base 196 of the GPIIIa cDNA
sequence [Newman et al, J. Clin. Inves., 83:1778
(1989)]. The T→C base change results in a
leucine/proline polymorphism at residue 33 of mature
GPIIIa. Although the leucine to proline polymorphism at
the amino terminal end of GPIIIa is responsible for the
PlA1/PlA2 platelet allotypes [Goldberg et al., Blood.
78:681 (1989)], synthetic linear peptides containing
this polymorphism [Flug et al, Blood,77:1964 (1991)]
did not react with anti-plA1 antibodies, suggesting that
the leucine33/proline33 polymorphism might affect global
folding or post-translational processing to assemble the
plA1 epitope.In one aspect, the present disclosure relates
to an isolated DNA molecule containing about 195 to 800
nucleotide base pairs that encodes an amino acid residue
sequence of GPIIIa that includes the PlA1 determinant.
Preferably, that DNA molecule has the nucleotide base
sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:10, SEQ
ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:16, or SEQ ID NO:18.The present disclosure also relates to an
isolated DNA molecule containing about 195 to 800
nucleotide base pairs that encodes an amino acid residue
sequence of GPIIIa that includes the PlA2 determinant,
which DNA molecule has the nucleotide base sequence of
SEQ
