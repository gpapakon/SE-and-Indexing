<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tri-substituted tetrahydrofuran
antifungals, such as (-)-[(5R)-cis-[-4-[4-[4-[4-[[5-(2,4-dihalophenyl)-5-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)tetrahydrofuran-3-yl]methoxy]phenyl]
substituted
antifungals, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, tri-substituted
tetrahydrofuran antifungal intermediates.International Publication Number WO 89/04829, published 1
June 1990 and USP 5,039,676 (A.K. Saksena etal.) discloses (±) cis and
(±) (trans antifungal compounds represented by the formula

   wherein X= F, Cl; Z=loweralkyl, (C2-C8) alkanoyl or phenyl
substituted by 2-loweralkyl-3-oxo-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl,e.g., (±)-cis and (±)-trans-1-[4-[[2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]tetrahydro-4-furanyl]methoxy]phenyl]-4-(1-methylethyl)piperazine.
However, WO 89/04829 does not specifically
disclose the compounds of this invention.There is a need for broad-spectrum antifungal agents to treat
systemic fungal infections, especially Aspergillus and Candida infections. The present invention provides compounds represented by
formula Ia

wherein X is independently both F or both Cl or one X is
independently F and the other is independently Cl;

and the carbon with the asterisk (*) have the R or S absolute
configuration; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The present invention also provides intermediates useful for
the production of antifungal compounds represented by formula I. Thus,
the present invention provides a compound represented by formula III or
VII:
wherein X is independently both F or both Cl or one X is independently
F and the other is independently Cl;L is OH or LG;LG is a leaving group; andZ=H, or (C1-C5) alkanoyl and the carbons with the asterisks (*)
have the R or S absolute configuration.The carbon with the asterisk in the compound of formula VII
may be in the R or S absolute configuration when Z is not equal to H;
each optical isomer of VIII may be independently converted into the
compounds of formula III by the synthetic steps of Scheme III listed
hereinafter.The sole figure illustrates the efficacy (PO) of preferred
antifungal compounds of this invention, e.g., the compounds of formula IIa
and IIb of this invention vs itraconazole, fluconazole and saperconazole
in compromised mice infected by inhalation of Aspergillusflavus spores.The term "leaving group" (LG) as used herein, means
leaving groups readily displaceable with appropriate reactants under
conventional conditions well known to those skilled in the organic
synthetic arts so as to form the
