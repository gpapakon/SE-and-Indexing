<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous inks containing 1,2-alkyl of from C4 to C10 diols, specifically 1,2-hexanediol 
or 1,2-pentanediol are employed in jet inks. Two such inks of 

different colors applied side-by-side to paper do not bleed and therefore give 
excellent image definition. The diols are not flammable, odorous or highly 

volatile.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to printing with liquid ink on paper with more than one color
positioned contiguously. Typically, the ink is applied as drops from an ink jet
printer. To achieve good color quality, the inks may not bleed laterally on the
paper into each other.This invention employs 1,2-alkane diols of from C4 to C10 (4 to 10 carbon atoms
forming the alkyl) in otherwise conventional aqueous inks to eliminate bleeding
of inks of different colors. The use of alcohols in such inks is conventional, as
illustrated in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,207,824 to Moffatt et al, 5,196,056 to Prasad
and 5,196,057 to Escano et al, but not the use of 1,2-alkane diols of from C4 to
C10. U.S. Patent No. 5,165,968 to Johnson et al lists 1, 2-pentane diol as
unacceptable for the inks of that patent.U.S. Patent No. 5,141,558 to Shirota et al teaches the use of a wide variation of
triols in such inks to improve anti-feathering, drying, and penetrability. U.S.
Patent No. 4,732,613 to Shioya et al teaches multi-color printing from inks
generally as contemplated by this invention and lists a number of di and tri propyl
or higher alcohols. 1,2,6-hexanetriol is listed, but the 1,2 diol of butane or higher
alkane is not listed.U.S. Patent No. 5,116,409 to Moffatt teaches a bleed alleviation mechanism
employing a surfactant to form micelles. At least with respect to the C4 to C6
diols of this invention, this invention does not employ micelle formation, as
shown by the absence of a sharp break in the surface tension versus
concentration plots of inks of this invention. The mechanism employed by this invention is increased penetration. Primary
alcohols such as n-propanol, n-butanol and n-pentanol increase penetration and
thus eliminate bleed, but for reasons such as flammability with the lower
alcohols, odor, and higher volatility in the ink, these primary alcohols should be
avoided or may be undesirable. The 1,2 diols of C4 and C10 have the same
effect on penetration and thus bleed but are not flammable and may be used in
inks without special precautions.This invention employs aqueous inks of at least two colors applied to paper close
together in time in close lateral proximity. In one aspect, the invention provides an ink
for ink jet printing as defined in claim 1. In another aspect, the invention provides a
process for multi-color printing as defined in claim 7. The inks contain at least in the order
of magnitude of 0.1 to 12.5 percent by weight 1,2- alkane diols of from C4 to C10,
preferably about 2.5 percent 1,2-hexanediol. In
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An ink for inkjet printing comprising an aqueous vehicle, a dye soluble in
said vehicle and, to eliminate bleeding in color printing, a 1,2-alkane diol

selected from the group 1,2-butanediol, 1,2-hexanediol, 1,2-octanediol and 1,2-decanediol,
said diol being present in an amount of at least 0.1% by weight of

the ink when the diol is 1,2-decanediol and at least 12.5% by weight of the ink
when the diol is 1,2-butanediol, and intermediate said amounts when the diol is

1,2-hexanediol or 1,2-octanediol.
An ink as in claim 1 in which said diol and its minimum concentration are
as follows:


1,2-hexanediol - 2.5%
1,2-octanediol - 1.0%.
An ink as in claim 1 in which said diol is present in an amount of less than
6% by weight.
An ink as in claim 1 in which said diol is 1,2-hexanediol.
An ink as in claim 4 in which said 1,2-hexanediol is present in amount of
at least 2.5% by weight of the ink.
An ink as in claim 1 in which said diol is 1,2-octanediol and is present in
amount of at least 1% by weight of the ink.
A process of multi-color printing comprising printing on paper from a first
ink of one color on a first region and in close proximity in time from a second ink

of a different color on a second contiguous region, each of said inks being an 
aqueous ink containing at least one water-soluble dye to provide said color and a

1,2-alkane diol having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms in an amount to prevent lateral
bleeding of said inks, said diol being present in an amount of at least 0.1% by

weight of the ink when the diol has 10 carbon atoms and at least 12.5% by
weight of the ink when the diol has 4 carbon atoms, and intermediate said

amounts when the diol has 5 to 9 carbon atoms.
A process as in claim 7 in which said diol and its minimum concentration
are as follows:


1,2-butanediol - 12.5%
1,2-pentanediol - 7.5%
1,2-hexanediol - 2.5%
1,2-octanediol - 1.0%
1,2-decanediol - 0.1%.
A process as in claim 7 or claim 8 in which said diol is present in an
amount of less than 6% by weight.
A process as in claim 7 in which said diol is 1,2-hexanediol.
A process as in claim 10 in which said diol is present in an amount of at
least 2.5% by weight.
A process as in claim 7 in which said diol is 1,2-pentanediol.
A process as in claim 12 in which said diol is present in an amount of at
least 7.5% by weight.
A process as in claim 7 in which said diol is 1,2-octanediol and is present
in an amount at least 1% by weight.
