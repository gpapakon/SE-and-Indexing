<ABSTRACT>
A scroll-type machine is disclosed which is particularly well suited for use 
as a compressor in refrigeration and air conditioning systems and incorporates a 

unique arrangement for modulating the capacity thereof. In one group of 
embodiments the capacity of the scroll-type machine is modulated by relative axial 

movement between the scroll members so as to form a leakage path across the wrap 
tips and opposed end plates. In another group of embodiments, modulation is 

achieved by reducing the orbital radius of one of the scroll members to thereby form 
a leakage path across the flank surfaces of the wraps. Both types of scroll separation 

may be accomplished in a time pulsed manner to thereby enable a full range of 
modulation with the duration of the loading and unloading periods being selected to 

maximize the efficiency of the overall system. A motor control arrangement is also 
disclosed which may be used with either of the modulation methods mentioned 

above to increase the efficiency of the motor during periods of reduced load. 
Additionally, either of the modulation arrangements mentioned above may be 

combined with a delayed suction form of capacity modulation with or without the 
motor control feature to thereby achieve better operating efficiency under certain 

conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to capacity modulation of compressors and more particularly to capacity modulation of scroll-type compressors.Capacity modulation is often a desirable feature to incorporate in air conditioning and refrigeration compressors in order to better accommodate the wide range of loading to which the systems may be subjected. Many different approaches have been utilized for providing this capacity modulation feature ranging from controlling of the suction inlet to bypassing discharge gas back to the suction inlet. With scroll-type compressors, capacity modulation has often been accomplished via a delayed suction approach which comprises providing ports at various positions which, when opened, allow the compression chambers formed between the intermeshing scroll wraps to communicate with the suction gas supply thereby delaying the point at which compression of the suction gas begins. This method of capacity modulation actually reduces the compression ratio of the compressor. While such systems are effective at reducing the capacity of the compressor, they are only able to provide a predetermined amount of compressor unloading, the amount of unloading being dependent upon the positioning of the unloading ports along the wraps. While it is possible to provide multiple step unloading by incorporating a plurality of such ports at different locations, this approach becomes costly and requires additional space to accommodate the separate controls for opening and closing each set of ports.The present invention, however, overcomes these deficiencies in that it enables virtually a continuous range of unloading from 100 percent or full capacity down to virtually zero capacity utilizing only a single set of controls. Further, the system of the present invention enables the operating efficiency of the compressor and/or refrigeration system to be maximized for any degree of compressor unloading desired.PCT 86/01262, upon which the precharacterizing portions of appended claim 1 is based, describes a positive displacement compressor or pump of the scroll type including first and second scroll plates having convoluted interfitting vanes. The flanks of the vanes on scroll plates are interfitting and in sealing contact with one another and the tips of the vanes in sealing contact with the other plate. One of the plates has a generally central port and the assemblage is provided with a peripheral port at the interface of the plates. A motor and linkage are provided to cause the plates to undergo
