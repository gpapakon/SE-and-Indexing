<ABSTRACT>
A unitary plural-material, interocclusal dental appliance (10) is disclosed for use in connection with orthodontic/orthopedic treatment of the teeth and jaws of a patient's mouth. The appliance includes a first region (14) made from a first material that provides a relatively hard expanse with first and second surfaces, and with the second surface being contactable by one such set of teeth. The second surface may be constructed with a substantially planar shape, or with a shape conforming generally to the cusps of such one set of teeth. A second region (16) is joined to the first region (14) and is made from a second material that provides a relatively soft, persistently resilient enclosure for the other such set of teeth. Additionally, a curable composition for making a soft, persistently resilient dental appliance is disclosed and it includes a polymer component including butyl methacrylate monomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to dental appliances in accordance with
the preamble of claim 1. More particularly, the invention concerns an
improved interocclusal appliance which provides improved appliance retention
and precise vertical and lateral positioning of the mandible, as well as a method
of forming such appliance.Interocclusal appliances, commonly referred to as splints, are well
known, and are used to secure or hold in proper position (or desired range of
positions) the mandible of a patient. Splints may be used for orthodontic
treatment, as well as for orthopedic treatment of the bone, joints and supporting
tissue associated with the mouth.For example, splints are used to treat various conditions including
temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction syndromes, myofascial pain
dysfunction syndrome, and symptomatic or asymptomatic loss of tooth structure
from subconscious parafunctional mandibular habits known as bruxism (grinding)
or clenching. Splints are also used to reduce wear on teeth caused by metal or
porcelain dental restorations during normal, functional or parafunctional
mandibular movement. Splints may also be used as anti-snoring devices to
resolve snoring problems and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).Several unimaterial, conventional splints have been proposed but
there are certain problems common to all of them. First, none of the so-called
"soft" splints remain soft over time. Conventional splints harden over time due
to their composition and/or due to leaching out of unreacted plasticizers present
in them. Such hardening is a drawback because soft, resilient splints are
preferred. Soft splints are preferred because they are more comfortable to wear
than hard appliances, and because they provide improved retention of the splint
held by the teeth.A second drawback associated with such splints is that they are
notoriously imprecise in terms of vertical and lateral positioning of the mandible 
under desired patient-bite conditions before they harden. Precise vertical and
lateral positioning of the mandible is critical to proper orthodontic/orthopedic
treatment. The section of conventional soft splints that is sandwiched by opposing
sets of teeth is imprecise because it "gives" an irregular amount when the patient
bites down under normal pressure, resulting in reduced TMJ stability in all
dimensions.Certain proposals have been made to make splints and other dental
appliances out of two materials with differentiated hardnesses. Apparently, the
idea is to use harder material in such

<CLAIMS>
A unitary plural-material, interocclusal dental appliance (10) for use in connection

with orthodontic/orthopedic treatment of the teeth, jaws and mandible
of a patient's mouth, comprising


a first region (14) made from a first material that provides a substantially
hard expanse with first and second surfaces (18a-18b), the second surface

(18b) being contactable by one such set of teeth;
a second region (16) joined to the first region, and being made from a second
material that provides a substantially soft, persistently resilient enclosure

for the other such set of teeth, the second region including plural zones
(28) each of which is structured to allow an adjacent enclosed tooth to move

toward the first surface of the first region, with such movement resulting in
penetration of corresponding teeth into the substantially hard first material

for a relatively precise distance, and with such penetration defining lateral
borders in the first material around such teeth so that the appliance accommodates

relatively fixed lateral and vertical positioning of the mandible
by enclosing such teeth upon desired biting action by the patient,
characterized in that
each plural zone (28) includes an opening formed along the occlusal side of
the second region (16) for allowing an associated enclosed tooth to contact

the first surface (18a) of the first region (14).
The appliance (10) of claim 1 wherein the expanse (18) is constructed with
a substantially planar second surface (18b).
The appliance (10) of claim 1 wherein the expanse (18) is constructed with
a second surface (18b) that conforms generally to the cusps of such one set

of teeth.
The appliance (10) of claim 1 wherein the second material includes a curable
composition comprising a polymer component including butyl metharylate

and a monomer component including butyl methacrylate monomer.
The appliance (10) of claim 1 wherein the first material includes an acrylic-based
polymer.
The appliance (10) of claim 1 wherein each opening is formed to allow only
the cusp of an associated tooth to contact the first surface of the first region.
The appliance (10) of claim 1 wherein the first (14) and second (16) regions
are generally U-shaped.
The appliance (10) of claim 7 wherein the second region (16) includes two
zones (28), each of which are positioned substantially distal to the sagittal

plane.
The appliance (10) of claim 8 wherein the second region (16) includes a
third zone (28) which is positioned substantially mesial to the sagittal plane.
In connection with conventional molding techniques usable to form a unimaterial
interocclusal dental appliance in a corresponding cavity of a mold,

the improvement involving a method of forming a unitary plural-material,
interocclusal dental appliance from such unimaterial appliance for use in

connection with orthodontic/orthopedic treatment of the teeth, jaws and
mandible of a patient's mouth, and comprising: 


removing a first section of such conventionally formed unimaterial appliance
to expose a surface of a second section of it;
forming plural openings (28) along the surface of the second section;
putting such unimaterial appliance back in the mold so that a void is formed,
the void being defined by the removed first section;
filling the void with curable material that is different from the material used
to form such unimaterial appliance;
covering the openings;
curing the newly formed appliance so that the two materials bond together
along the surface of the second section, thus to form a unitary plural-material,

interocclusal dental appliance (10) with the first section (14) made from
material that is different from the second section (16), so that after curing, plural

opposing pairs of the patient's teeth are allowed to contact opposite sides of
the first section.
The method of claim 10 further including the step of applying a bonding
agent to the surface of the second section prior to the filling step.
The method of claim 11 wherein the applying step involves using a liquid,
acrylic-based bonding agent.
