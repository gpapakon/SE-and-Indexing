<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a variable dust evacuator with a blower (2), a filter (3), and a sound absorber (4) which altogether form the units, a sucking-off strip and at least one housing, the component parts (5, 6) of which can easily be arranged in different positions in relation to one another and thus in different places in the room and be adapted to environmental requirements. To this end, it is proposed that the units are accommodated in two separate, interconnectable, rectangular housings, the two housings have a rectangular flat constructional shape, with the same height and the same extent in a further dimension, which together produce the fit sides, the filter is accommodated in one housing (5) and the blower and the sound absorber in the other housing (6), the housing of the filter having the inflow opening in one fit side and the transfer opening in the opposite fit side.
