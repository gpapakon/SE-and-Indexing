<ABSTRACT>
Amines are produced in high yield by the 
process which comprises allowing a cyclic ketone to 

react with ammonia in the presence of active carbon to 
produce imino derivatives and then, allowing the imino 

derivatives to react with hydrogen in the presence of 
a hydrogenating catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process 
for producing amines and more particularly, to a 
process for producing amines which comprises allowing 
cyclic ketones to react with ammonia in the presence 
of active carbon to produce imino derivatives of the 
ketones and then allowing the imino derivatives to 
react with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenating 
catalyst. Amines are useful as intermediates for fine 
chemicals and raw materials for resins and are well 
known to be produced by reductive amination of cyclic 
ketones. For example, for production of 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexylamine 
(IPDA) by reductive 
amination of 3-cyano-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexanone 
(IPCN), the following processes have been known. 1 ○ 
A one-step process which comprises allowing IPCN to 
react with ammonia and hydrogen in the presence of a 
hydrogenating catalyst such as Raney cobalt (Japanese 
Patent Kokai No. 62-123154). 2 ○ A two-step process 
which comprises allowing IPCN to react with ammonia 
in the presence of an ion exchanger such as sulfonated 
polystyrene to produce an imino derivative and then 
allowing the resultant imino derivative to react with 
hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenating catalyst 
(U.S. Patent 4,429,157). 3 ○ A two-step process which 
comprises allowing IPCN to react with ammonia in the 
presence of an acidic metal oxide such as alumina to 
produce an imino derivative and then allowing the 
resultant imino derivative to react with hydrogen in 
the presence of a hydrogenating catalyst (Japanese 
Patent Kokai No. 4-221350). However, the one-step process 1 ○ has the  
 
defects that a reduction reaction of carbonyl group 
also takes place to produce a large amount of alcohols 
as by-products and yield of the desired product is 
low. Furthermore, in the two-step processes 2 ○ and 
3 ○, by-production of alcohols is inhibited and yield 
of the desired product can be improved, but is not 
yet satisfactory. The inventors have found that yield of the 
desired product can be further improved by using 
active carbon as the catalyst for production of imino 
derivatives and accomplished the present invention. That is, the present invention provides an 
industrially excellent process for production of amines 
by reductive amination of cyclic ketones to the 
corresponding amines, characterized in that cyclic 
ketones are allowed to react with ammonia in the 
presence of active carbon to produce imino derivatives 
of the ketones and then the resulting imino derivatives 
are allowed to react
