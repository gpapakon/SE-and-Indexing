<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material,
more particularly to a silver halide photographic material having improved antistatic
property and improved coating ability.Silver halide photographic materials are generally composed of an
electrically insulating support and photographic layers coated thereon. Such a
structure promotes the formation and accumulation of static charges when subjecting
the photographic materials to friction or separation, caused by contact with
the surface of the same or different materials during steps for manufacturing of the
photographic materials or when using them for photographic purposes. These
accumulated static charges cause several drawbacks. The most serious drawback
is discharge of accumulated charges prior to development processing, by which the
light-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer is exposed to light to form dot spots or
branched or feathery linear specks when development of the photographic film is
carried out. This is the phenomenon of the so-called "static marks". Such static
marks cause a reduction of the commercial value of photographic films, which
sometimes become completely useless. For example, the formation of static marks
in medical or industrial X-ray films may result in a very dangerous judgment or
erroneous diagnosis. Static marks are a particular problem because it becomes
evident for the first time by carrying out development. Further, these static charges
are also the origin of secondary problems such as adhesion of dusts to the surface
of films, uneven coating, and the like.As mentioned above, such static charge are frequently accumulated when
manufacturing and/or using silver halide photographic materials. For example,
during production, they are generated by friction of the photographic film contacting
a roller or by separation of the emulsion surface from the support surface during a
rolling or unrolling step. Further, they are generated on X-ray films in an automatic 
apparatus by contact with or separating from mechanical parts or fluorescent
screens, or they are generated by contact with or separation from rollers and bars
made of rubber, metal, or plastics in a bonding machine or an automatic
developing machine or an automatic developing apparatus or in a camera in the
case of using color negative films or color reversal films. In addition they can be
generated by contacting with packing materials, and the like.Silver halide photographic materials having high sensitivity and handling
speed are subject to
