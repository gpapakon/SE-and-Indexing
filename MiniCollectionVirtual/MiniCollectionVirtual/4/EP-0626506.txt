<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for monitoring the efficiency of a catalytic converter by using one lambda probe upstream and one lambda probe downstream of the catalytic converter. The ratio is formed between the times in which the lambda probe downstream of the catalytic converter and the lambda probe upstream of the catalytic converter indicates a rich or lean mixture value. The catalytic converter has an adequate efficiency when the smaller value of these ratios is less than a predeterminable limit.

Method for checking the efficiency of a catalyst 
having an oxygen probe upstream and an oxygen probe 

downstream of the catalyst, characterized in that 

during a test period, the ratios of the times during 
which, on the one hand, the oxygen probe downstream of 

the catalyst and the oxygen probe upstream of the catalyst 
indicate a rich mixture (VF) and during which, on 

the other hand, the oxygen probe downstream of the 
catalyst and the oxygen probe upstream of the catalyst 

indicate a lean mixture (VM), are formed, 
the value of smaller amount (V
min
) of these two ratios 
(VF, VM) is taken and the efficiency of the catalyst is 

indicated as sufficient if the value (V
min
) thus determined 
is lower than a predeterminable limi
t value (GW). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the catalyst efficiency check is conducted only when 

the internal combustion engine is in an approximately 
stationary operating state. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the lower value (V
min
) of the ratios of the lean and 
rich times is subjected to averaging before the 

comparison with the limit value (GW). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the result of the catalyst efficiency check is 

supplied for statistical evaluation. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the limit value of the ratio times (GW) is dependent 

on the load and speed of the internal combustion engine.
