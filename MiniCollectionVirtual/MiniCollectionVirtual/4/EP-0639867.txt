<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an accumulator battery, in particular a drive battery for electric road vehicles, having a plurality of cells, which are arranged in a battery container in rows and with spacings between their housings. In the case of this battery, a cooling device reverses the stream of a cooling medium (air) alternately from one direction into the opposite direction, by means of which the respective order of priority in which fresh air or already preheated air is applied to the cells is also reversed. As a result, a temperature difference (temperature gradient) between the cells, which is unavoidable when the cooling stream has a constant direction and which can give rise to operational disturbances, is largely levelled out. A possible device for reverse cooling is a fan (1), which can swivel through 180 DEG , in a tube connector (4) leading to the battery container (5).
