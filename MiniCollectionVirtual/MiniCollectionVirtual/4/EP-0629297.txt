<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for an integrated optical component, especially a modulator, directional coupler, switch, polariser, distributor or the like and a process for producing it. The component has a light-guide (17) made of an optical polymer on a silicon substrate (10) with at least one optical buffer layer (14) with a low refractive index, having a V-shaped positioning groove (12) anisotropically etched into the substrate (10) and essentially aligned with the light-guide (17) to receive a glass fibre (11) to be coupled to the terminal coupling area (18) of the light-guide by shock coupling. The end region on the coupling side of the positioning groove (12) is filled with a plastic material (15). The light-guide (17) extends on the plastic material (15) as far as an end area (18) of the plastic material (15) running perpendicularly to the axial direction of the light-guide (17) in the plane of the coupling terminal surface. This end area (18) is arranged outside an oblique end region (13) of the positioning groove (12). The end surface (18) and hence the terminal coupling area can thus easily be produced by laser machining, while the conventional method of making the positioning groove by anisotropic etching can be used. Overall, high stability can be achieved with the simple and precise alignment of glass fibre (11) and light-guide (17).
