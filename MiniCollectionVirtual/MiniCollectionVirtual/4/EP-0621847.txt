<ABSTRACT>
A waste bag holder (10, 110) has a frame (11, 111) mountable on a support (e.g. a cupboard door (14)) and has hooks (29, 129) to enable a bag (27, 127) to be suspended therefrom. A lid (16, 116) is hingedly mounted intermediate the sides (17, 18) of the frame (11, 111) to define a small rear mouth portion (19), larger front mouth portion (22) to receive waste (24). Integral lips (25, 125, 125A) direct the waste (24) into the bag (27, 127). A detachable skirt (30, 130) is suspended from the frame (11, 111) to conceal the bag (27, 127) when the holder (10, 110) is viewed from the front or either side.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a waste bag holder. There is an on-going need for an efficient 
method of disposing of domestic kitchen or bathroom 
waste. While waste bins are readily available, they are 
untidy and messy to use, especially if they are not 
lined with a disposable liner. Most supermarkets provide plastic bags for 
shoppers to transport their purchases from the shop to 
home. Some people use these bags for e.g. kitchen waste 
disposal, by hanging them from the knobs on kitchen- or 
bathroom- cupboard doors. The bags are untidy to look 
at and liable to attract flies or other insects to the 
waste therein. AU-B-61611/86 (556230) (Bautex Bautechnik für 
Projektierung und Baudurchführung AG and Bernd Hermann) 
does disclose a waste bag support assembly where the 
waste bag can be covered by a spring biassed lid. This 
frame assembly requires the use of a waste bag support 
frame to be inserted in the waste bag and be engaged on 
a ledge of a support frame, and the bag is not concealed 
from view. It is an object to provide a holder for such 
bags which is simple to use and which is aesthetically 
pleasing. It is a preferred object to provide a holder 
when the bag is concealed. It is a further preferred object to provide a 
holder which has a lid which may be hinged to allow the 
bag to receive waste from a bench top or a utensil, bowl 
or plate.  
 It is a still further preferred object to 
provide a holder which is easily cleaned, can be easily 
moved and maybe a "fashion accessory" for a kitchen or 
bathroom. Other preferred objects will become apparent 
from the following description. In a broad aspect the present invention 
resides in a waste bag holder, to hold supermarket or 
department store bags or the like, including: 
a frame; means to mount the frame on a support; means to suspend a flexible container from 
the frame; and skirt means depending from the frame so that 
the flexible container is substantially surrounded by 
the skirt and the support.  The frame preferably has at least a rear wall 
and a pair of forwardly directed side arms. Preferably the frame is a peripheral frame 
with a front wall interconnecting the forward ends of 
the side arms. The frame may be formed of stainless steel, 
painted or powder-coated steel, aluminium (which may be 
painted, powder-coated or anodized), plastics, wood 
and/or a combination of same. The frame is preferably 
square, rectangular, circular, elliptical or D-shaped in 
top plan view. A downwardly, inwardly directed tongue 
may be provided

A waste bag holder, to hold supermarket or 
department store bags (27) or the like, including: 


a frame (11); 
means (12) to mount the frame on a support; 
means (29) to suspend a flexible container (27) from 
the frame;
 
   characterized by 

skirt means (30) depending from the frame (11) so that 
the flexible container is substantially surrounded by 

the skirt and the support. 
A holder according to Claim 1 wherein: 

the frame has a rear wall (13), a pair of 
forwardly directed side arms (18) and optionally, a front 

wall (31) interconnecting the forward ends of the side arms. 
A holder according to Claim 2 wherein: 

the frame (11) is square, rectangular, circular, 
elliptical or D-shaped in top plan view; 
a downwardly, inwardly directed tongue (25; 125) is 
provided on the rear wall (13) of the frame to enter the 

mouth of a bag or container suspended from the frame; 
and 
optionally, a second downwardly, inwardly 
directed tongue (125A) is provided on the front wall to enter 

the mouth of the bag or container. 
A holder according to any one of Claims 1 to 3 
wherein: 


a lid (16) is hingedly mounted intermediate the 
length of the side arms of the frame so that when open, 

the lid divides the frame into a small, rear mouth 
portion and a larger, front mouth portion. 
A holder according to any one of Claims 1 to 4 
wherein: 


a bag or container is suspended from hooks (29) 
or pins inwardly directed from the frame. 
A holder according to any one of Claims 1 to 5  
 

wherein: 

the rear wall (and optionally the front 
wall) of the frame has an integral inwardly, downwardly 

directed lip receivable within the mouth of the bag or 
container to direct waste into the bag or container.
