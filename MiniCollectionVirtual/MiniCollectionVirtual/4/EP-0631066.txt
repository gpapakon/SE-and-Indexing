<ABSTRACT>
A thixotropic material (3) is charged in a 
container (1). The container (1) also receives a movable member (5) 

which is placed in the thixotropic material (3) so as to stir 
the thixotropic material. A force transmitting element (4) 

is connected to the movable member (5). When an object the 
vibration of which is to be controlled is out of resonance, 

the amplitude of vibration is so small that the 
thixotropic material is in gel state, thus presenting a 

comparatively large spring constant of the vibration 
control apparatus. As the excitation frequency is 

increased towards resonance range, the amplitude of 
vibration is increased correspondingly, so that the 

movable member stirs the thixotropic material to generate 
stress in the latter, whereby the phase of the 

thixotropic material is changed from gel to sol. Consequently, 
the natural frequency of the vibration system 

including the object and the vibration control apparatus 
is lowered, thus averting from resonance. It is thus 

possible to obtain vibration restraining or control 
effect over a wide range of excitation frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibration system comprising
an object and an apparatus for controlling a vibration of said
object, said apparatus comprising a container, a thixotropic
material contained in said container, a movable member placed
in said thixotropic material for stirring it, and a force
transmitting member attached at one end thereof to said movable
member and at the other end thereof to said object.From the DE-A-23 02 657 such a vibration system is known.A further vibration system with another vibration control
apparatus comprising thixotropic material is disclosed in SU-A-15
69 461. However, the vibration control apparatus according
to SU-A-15 69 461 is of another kind than the vibration
control apparatus described above because it uses an elastic
container capable of transmitting its deformation directly
from the container walls to the thixotropic material.Yet another vibration system comprising a further 
vibration control apparatus
is disclosed in JP-A-53-13070. This
known vibration control apparatus has a container and a
thixotropic material contained in the container. The
term "thixotropic material" is used in this specification
to mean a material which normally does not exhibit
fluidity and is in gel state with elasticity but is
changed into non-elastic sol state exhibiting fluidity
under energy such as of vibration, and resume the
original gel state when the vibration is extinguished.This known vibration control apparatus damps
vibration as the energy of vibration is absorbed by the
phase transformation form gel state into sol state of the
thixotropic material. In other words, this vibration
control apparatus produce the vibration damping effect
only in the transition period in which the phase is
changed from gel to sol. Thus, no appreciable vibration
damping effect is obtained when the phase transformation
has been completed, i.e., when the whole thixotropic
material has been transformed from gel into sol. This
type of vibration control apparatus, therefore, cannot
suitable be used under conditions where vibration is 
applied continuously for a certain period of time.Known vibration control apparatus also suffers
from a problem in that, when the frequency of externally
applied vibration progressively increases as in the case
of start up and acceleration of a rotary machine to rated
speed, the vibration control apparatus undesirably
resonates to produce vibration of greater amplitudes, as
well as noise, when the vibration frequency has coincided
with the natural frequency of
