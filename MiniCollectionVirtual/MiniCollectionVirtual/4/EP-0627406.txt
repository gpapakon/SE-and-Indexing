<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 2-amino-1,3-propanediol
compounds useful as pharmaceuticals, particularly as an
immunosuppressant.In recent years, cyclosporin is in use for suppressing
rejection developed in transplanting organs. Inclusive of the
compounds currently under development, the so-called
immunosuppressants are expected to be useful as therapeutic
agents for articular rheumatism and so on. Said cyclosporin,
however, also poses problems of side effects such as renal
disorders.Meanwhile, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No.
104087/1989 discloses that an immunosuppressive substance is
obtained from a liquid culture of Isaria sinclairii and said
substance has been confirmed to be (2S,3R,4R)-(E)-2-amino-3,4-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-14-oxoicosa-6-enoic
acid of the
formula

disclosed in US Patent No. 3928572. In addition, Japanese
Patent Unexamined Publication No. 128347/1991 (corresponding to
EP-A-0410176) states that a series of said compound has an
immunosuppressive action. Referring to Merck Index, 11th edition, it is described
that 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (Index No. 460), 2-amino-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol
(Index No. 451) and 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol
(also called tromethamine, Index
No. 9684) can be used as surfactants, intermediates for
pharmaceuticals, emulsifiers or gas adsorbents and that
tromethamine is medically usable as an alkalization agent. In
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 416/1987, a hair dye
containing 2-amino-2-(C1-C5 alkyl)-1,3-propanediol is disclosed.
US Patent No. 4910218 and J. Med. Chem., vol. 33, 2385-2393
(1990) teach 2-amino-2-(methyl or ethyl)-1,3-propanediol as an
intermediate for an antitumor agent. Also, Japanese Patent
Unexamined Publication No. 192962/1984 teaches that the
aforementioned 2-amino-2-(C1-C5 alkyl)-1,3-propanediol or 2-amino-1,3-propanediol
can be used as a stabilizer for an
antigen or antibody-sensitized latex reagent. Moreover, US
Patent No. 3062839 teaches 2-methyl- or ethyl-amino-2-(furylmethyl,
phenylmethyl or phenylmethyl substituted by lower
alkyl, lower alkoxy, chloro, hydroxy or unsubstituted amine)-1,3-propanediol
having a tranquilizer action ; J. Org. Chem.,
vol. 25, 2057-2059 (1960) teaches 2-methylamino-2-(phenylmethyl
or phenylmethyl substituted by 2-methyl, 3-methyl, 4-methyl, 4-methoxy
or 4-hydroxy)-1,3-propanediol ; WO 92/16236 discloses a
membrane penetration enhancing agent of the formula:
 
wherein:
R is selected from H, and an aliphatic hydrocarbon group with
from about 1 to about 20 carbon

compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof of any 

one of Claims 1 to 43.
