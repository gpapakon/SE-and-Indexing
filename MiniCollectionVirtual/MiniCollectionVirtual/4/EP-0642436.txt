Sulky comprising two wheels individually fastened along the same rotational axis, to a common structure provided with a driver's seat (4) and shafts (3) leading towards the draught animal. The sulky (1) consists of a construction kit comprising a plurality of substantially flat elements (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) adapted to be assembled by the end user by means of ordinary hand tools. Two of these parts are end frames (5) adapted for fastening of a wheel (2), a shaft (3), and the crossbar (6) in the same vertical plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sulky comprising two 
wheels, individually fastened, but along the same rotational 
axis, to a common frame provided with a driver's seat and 
shafts leading towards the draught animal. Sulkies of this type are used for trotting races and the 
most important requirements are that they have a lightweight 
construction, that they are easy-running, and that they are 
strongly built to endure the specific strain during excercise 
and competitions. To obtain constructions of a sufficiently stiff and 
stable structure and at the same time of lowest possible 
weight, sulkies so far have been manufactured as welded steel 
constructions as this has led to the most lightweight construction 
combined with sufficient strength. Certainly there have earlier been attempts to build 
sulkies of aluminium, however such sulkies have got a rather 
bad reputation due to poor strength qualities. A conventional sulky has its shafts fastened approximately 
10 cms inside of the wheels. This fact leads to a construction 
well adapted for welded steel pipes, but it is 
unsuitable when light metals are conserned, just because the 
construction then requires welding. This is probably the 
reason why earlier attempts using aluminium have failed, as 
the design then has been similar to the conventional steel 
constructions requiring a welding process. It is a fact that 
aluminium and other light metals are difficult to weld, in 
particular when weaknesses in the metal can not be allowed 
at, or close to the welding points. Storing and transportation of conventional sulkies has 
led to difficulties due to an awkward shape. The manufacturing 
process has also been expensive and much handwork has 
been required. Sulkies having even less weight have always 
been desirable, even if specialists in this field of technique 
have been convinced that still lighter sulkies could not 
be manufactured without a corresponding strenght reduction. A sulky according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from SE-A-8202219. The object of the present invention is to provide a new 
sulky construction having such a design that it may be manufactured 
of light metal and other lightweight and yet durable 
materials.  
 A further object of the present invention is to provide 
a sulky which may be assembled easily by a user himself, from 
substantially flat elements requiring only a small space 
during storing and transportation, said elements being easily 
dispatched in a flat package. Still a further object of the present

<CLAIMS>
Sulky comprising two wheels (2) individually fastened, 
but with a common rotational axis, to a frame provided with 

shafts (3) and having a driver's seat (4) between the wheels 
(2), where the sulky (1) comprises a construction kit having 

a number of elements (2,3,4,5,6) adapted for packing flat, 

and to be assembled by the user by means of simple hand 
tools, and where two of these elements are end frames (5,5) 

while one element is a crossbar (6) for suspending the seat 
(4),
characterized in that
 
each end frame (5,5) has substantially the shape of a single 

triangular part where two of the sides are of substantially 
equal length and the adjacent angle is obtuse; where each end 

frame at its one acute corner is provided with two forked 
arms (9,9) adapted to allow the detachable mounting of a 

wheel axle for a wheel (2), at its obtuse corner is provided 
with a transversly placed assembly bushing (7) substantially 

arranged parallel to the wheel axles and adapted for detatchable 
assembly of the end portion of the crossbar (6) ; and at 

its other acute corner is provided with an assembly hole 
(10), substantially in the same plane as the wheel (2) and 

adapted for receiving a shaft (3); so that each end frame 
holds the crossbar (6), the shaft (3) and the wheel (2) 

together in a mutually stable position without help from 
further elements of construction. 
Sulky according to claim 1, and where the crossbar (6) 
is constructed of an extruded hollow profile (13),
characterized in that
 
the hollow profile (13) has an outer dimension and shape 

which with a certain play fits into the assembly bushings 
(7); said hollow profile (13) is provided with internal 

fastening means (14,15) adapted to receive at least one 
strengthening element (18,19) provided with internal, threaded 

holes (20,21) which, when position and shape is considered, 
are adapted to corresponding transversal unthreaded  

 
holes (24,25) in the assembly bushing (7) and the hollow 

profile (13). 
Sulky according to claim 2,
characterized
 in that each strengthening element 
(18,19) comprises a one-piece element being provided with two 

sets of threaded borings (20,21) adapted respectively to 
diametrically opposite holes (24,25) in the mounting bushing 

(7) and in the hollow profile (13). 
Sulky according to claim 2 or 3,
characterized
 in that
 
on the outer side of the mounting bushing (7) there is also 

arranged at least one strengthening washer (23) having corresponding 
unthreaded holes. 
Sulky according to claims 1-4,
characterized
 in that
 
for fastening the shaft (3), the assembly hole (10) is provided 

with horizontal tightening screws (16) and a vertically 
arranged set screw (17) which penetrates both the wall of the 

assembly hole (10) and the shaft mounted therein (3). 
Sulky according to any one of the above claims,
characterized
 in that
 
the material of the end frames (5) and/or the crossbar (6) is 

a light metal which may be deformed by strain caused by 
ordinary hand tools, while the strengthening element(s) 

(18,19) consist(s) of a more rigid and not so easily deformed 
material. 
Sulky according to any one of the above claims,
characterized
 in that
 
the two end frames (5) when assembled have a completely 

identical geometric shape. 
Sulky according to claim 8,
characterized
 in that
  
 

the right and left end frames (5) are manufactured with 
completely identical geometric shapes which are modified 

during assembly, as the outer portion of the mounting bushing 
(7) is removed from opposite sides of the right and the left 

end frame (5), so that the right and the left end frame (5) 
in an assembled position will be different, but all the same 

symmetrical, with reference to the central plane of the 
sulky.
