<ABSTRACT>
A combination developer and toner delivery roller (12) is used to 
carry a layer of liquid toner (48) to a development nip (46) formed between the 

conductive surface of roller (12) and the undeveloped, imaged photoconductor 
surface (44) so as to reduce preexposure of the undeveloped, imaged 

photoconductor surface (44) to minimize independent fringe field induced edge 
effect development. The layer of liquid toner (48) is applied to the surface of 

roller (12) by either contact with an elongated meniscus of liquid toner 
emanating from elongated slot (22) in toner delivery assembly (14), or by a 

spray application through a plurality of toner spray nozzles (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the use of a combination
developer and liquid toner delivery drum to deliver liquid toner to a
photoconductive surface to reduce unwanted fringe field edge effect toner
development, and more particularly to a combination developer and liquid toner
delivery roller that carries a film of toner from a supply source to a nip line
formed between the combination developer and delivery drum and the photoconductive
surface in both charged and discharged area development
photoelectric processes.In both charged area and discharged area development, using a
development roller to help establish the correct electromagnetic force fields
(EMF) and to regulate the amount of liquid toner transferred to the
photoconducting surface is quite common. For purposes of this disclosure,
discharged area development is disclosed and used to place the present
invention in proper context. However, it should be distinctly understood that
the present invention is adaptable for use with charged area development. Also,
for purposes of this disclosure, a photoconductive drum is used, although
photoconductive belts are also in common use, and the principles of this
disclosure apply equally to either drums or belts. In discharged area
development, the photoconductor is provided with a uniform charge, either
positive or negative. The development roller is provided with a similar charge,
as are the particles of toner to be applied to the photo-conductor. The image to
be developed, either a dither pattern image or a solid image, is imprinted upon
the photoconductor drum. The dither pattern image is usually imaged by means
of a laser print engine. A print engine is used to expose portions of the surface 
of the photoconductor drum to form the imprint of the eventual printed image.
Other light sources are used for solid images. Exposure of the surface of the
photoconductor to the light reduces the charge on the photoconductive surface
material in the exposed area to a level significantly below that of the unexposed
areas of the photoconductive surface.In developing the image, two things must occur at the same point.
The photoconductor drum, or belt, and a development roller must form an
elemental development nip line at a precisely configured, spaced distance apart,
and liquid toner, containing the appropriately charged particles, must be injected
into the nip in order to develop the image.Toner, as it is being carried through the development nip, which is
the elementally aligned closest point of approach
