<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a speed variator according to 
the precharacterizing portion of claim 1. Such a device is known from US-A-2 864 259. US-A-4 194 407 
discloses a variable speed transmission which does not have 
all the features mentioned in the preamble of claim 1 but 
which is of the variable throw crank type, and which comprises 
a plurality of unidirectional drive s 
ystems which are reversible in order to reverse the 
rotational direction of the output shaft. A drawback of the speed variator known from the above-mentioned 
publications is the control device incorporated in 
the drive shaft. Inasmuch as this control device is of 
mechanical construction, the assembly thereof is very 
complicated. Further, the known control device is subject to 
wear and must therefore be checked periodically and revised if 
necessary. Moreover, the costs of manufacture of the known 
control device are high, owing to the great number of parts 
from which it is composed. For some applications, the device known from 
US-A-2 864 259 has the drawback that, independently of the 
direction of rotation of the input shaft, the output shaft 
always has the same direction of rotation. In order to enable 
the output shaft to be rotated in both directions, therefore, 
a separate rotational-direction reversing box must be 
connected to the output shaft. Apart from the additional costs 
which such a box brings with it, this box has a further 
disadvantage in that it introduces an additional source of 
friction and that, further, often a friction or fluid clutch 
is necessary to enable the direction of motion of the output 
shaft to be reversed. The object of the invention is to provide a speed variator 
without the drawbacks mentioned above. To that end, a speed variator of the type described in the 
preamble is characterized by features in the characterizing 
portion of claim 1.  
 Inasmuch as the control device for the eccentric discs, 
which is incorporated in the drive shaft, is of hydraulic, 
pneumatic or electromechanical construction, the number of 
parts thereof is considerably smaller compared with the known 
mechanical control device and the costs of manufacture of such 
a control device are significantly lower. At the same time, 
the assembly of the control device according to the invention 
is considerably simpler. Further, the hydraulic, pneumatic or 
electromechanical control device is hardly subject to wear and 
accordingly the invention provides a durable, reliably 
operating control device. Further, in
