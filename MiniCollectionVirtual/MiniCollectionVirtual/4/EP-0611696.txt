<ABSTRACT>
A compacting unit (1) for groups (2) of flat 
products (3) arranged side by side on edge, wherein the 

groups (2) are transported on a conveyor (4), with the 
products (3) in each group (2) housed axially separate 

inside a transverse pocket (7) moving with the conveyor 
(4), and are successively engaged by a compacting device 

(16) featuring a pair of opposed compacting arms (42). 
Each compacting arm (42) presents an operating end (44), 

and is operated cyclically so that, for each cycle, the 
operating end (44) is aligned with a pocket (7) of a 

group (2), travels with and penetrates inside the pocket 
(7), and moves along the pocket (7) towards the 

operating end (44) of the other arm (42) so as to move 
the products (3) in the respective group (2) 

transversely into contact with one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compacting unit 
for groups of flat products arranged side by side on 
edge. The present invention is especially suitable for 
use in the food industry and in particular for packing 
flat food products such as sweets, lozenges and similar, 
to which the following description refers purely by way 
of example. U.S. Patent n. 5,076,416 relates to a device for 
supplying an orderly succession of flat products, 
whereby the products, e.g. cylindrical sweets, laid 
"flat" and in random manner on a vibratory surface, are 
fed to a number of curved downfeed channels, each of 
which rotates the products substantially 90Â° into an "on 
edge" position, and feeds them one by one into 
respective pockets on a respective screw conveyor. Each screw conveyor feeds the products forward 
transversely and deposits them successively and on edge 
on to an output conveyor extending beneath the output  
 
ends of the screw conveyors and comprising a conveyor 
belt with a succession of transverse pockets, each 
designed to receive a group of products arranged side by 
side and on edge. The conveyor belt travels beneath a 
number of guide rods parallel to the traveling direction 
of the output conveyor, and each pair of adjacent guide 
rods defines, along the output conveyor, a respective 
axial channel along which are fed successively all the 
products fed on to the output conveyor by a given screw 
conveyor. In other words, the screw conveyors are so 
timed in relation to the output conveyor as to feed a 
respective product into each pocket on the output 
conveyor, and the output ends of the screw conveyors are 
offset so that each screw conveyor always feeds its 
products into a given respective axial channel. Downstream from the last screw conveyor, 
therefore, each pocket on the output conveyor contains a 
group of products arranged side by side on edge, aligned 
in a direction perpendicular to the traveling direction 
of the output conveyor, and separated in said 
perpendicular direction by the guide rods. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a product compacting device featuring an input 
conveyor similar to the output conveyor described above, 
and which provides in a straightforward, reliable manner 
for supplying a succession of compacted groups, each 
consisting of a number of transversely-contacting 
products for supply to a follow-up operating unit  
 
normally consisting of a wrapping line. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a compacting unit

<CLAIMS>
A compacting unit (1) for groups (2) of flat 
products (3) arranged side by side on edge along a first 

axis (2a) perpendicular to the products (3); the unit 
(1) comprising conveyor means (4) having a first (8) and 

second (15) portion and designed to feed said groups (2) 
successively in a given direction (6) perpendicular to 

the first axis (2a); and a compacting device (16) 
cooperating with said conveyor means (4); the conveyor 

means (4) comprising a number of pocket means (7) 
equally spaced in said direction (6) and each designed 

to receive a respective said group (2); and spacing 
means (9) extending along said first portion (8), for 

separating the products (3) in each group (2) along the 
first axis (2a); characterized by the fact that the 

compacting device (16) comprises two lever arms (42) in 
turn comprising respective operating heads (44) located 

at said second portion (15) and designed to engage said 
products (3) for compacting them against one another 

parallel to said first axis (2a), the lever arms (42) 
being designed to rotate about respective second axes 

(38) located on either side of said conveyor means (4) 
and substantially perpendicular to said traveling 

direction (6) and said first axis (2a); first actuating 
means (21) for moving each second axis (38) cyclically 

about a respective third axis (20) parallel to the 
second axis (38); and second actuating means (48) for  

 
rotating each lever arm (42) about said respective 

second axis (38). 
A unit as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that the first actuating means (21) comprise 

crank means (18) interposed between each third axis (20) 
and the respective second axis (38); and first drive 

means (33) for rotating the crank means (18) about the 
respective third axis (20). 
A unit as claimed in Claim 2, characterized by 
the fact that the first actuating means (21) also 

comprise cam means (36) located along each said third 
axis (20) between the respective first drive means (33) 

and the respective crank means (18), for moving the 
crank means (18) cyclically in a direction parallel to 

the respective third axis (20), and for moving the 
respective operating head (44) to and from a lowered 

position selectively engaging said pocket means (7). 
A unit as claimed in any one of the foregoing 
Claims, characterized by the fact that each said lever 

arm (42) constitutes a first arm (42) of a respective 
rocker arm (41) pivoting on the respective second axis 

(38) and comprising a second arm (43); said second 
actuating means (48) being connected to said second arm 

(43). 
A unit as claimed in Claim 4, characterized by 
the fact that said second arms (43) are oriented towards 

each other; the second actuating means (48) comprising 
an output member (49) connected to both the second arms
