<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a device (1) for the temporary attachment of a non-linear electrical or magnetic security tagging element (2) operating together with an electronic monitoring system to CD, audio or video cassettes or similar objects (3) to protect them against unauthorised removal, with a rigid security tagging element carrier (4) in the form of a divided frame (5), the frame sections (6, 8) of which can be secured to the object (3) to be protected and can be locked against the unauthorised removal of the object (3) by means of a bimetal spring (10) as the locking member, in which the bimetal spring (10), which forms an externally electrically-connectable resistance heating element, is secured to the inside of one frame section (8) facing the object in the operative position and locks said frame section (8) to the other (6) in its normal operative position at room temperature but, on heating, is set to a release position in which the frame sections (6, 8) can be removed from each other and thus the security tagging element carrier (4) can be removed from the object (3) to be safeguarded.
