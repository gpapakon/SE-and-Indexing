<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for controlling the revolution speed of a motor using an incremental detector so that the motor is to be simply controlled with lower starting torque and lower starting short-circuit current. To this end, the pulse width of a control signal taken to a final power stage controlling the motor is modulated.

Method for controlling the speed of a motor, it
being the case that a control signal led to a power

output element controlling the motor is subjected to
pulse width modulation and, in the process, the speed

characteristic of the motor is monitored and compared
width an expected speed characteristic, characterized

in that for the purpose of achieving a soft start
and/or a soft stop of the motor the pulse width

modulation of the control signal is controlled as a
function of position using an incremental encoder.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the pulse width modulation of the control signal

is controlled as a function of time and position.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the pulse width modulation

of a control signal is performed monotonically.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the control signal produces

a directly proportional increase in speed or
reduction in speed of the motor.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the pulse width modulation

of the control signal is performed from the or to
an output or final value differing from zero.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the motor speed is monitored

and compared with a reference value, and in the
event of a minimum deviation of the motor speed from a 

reference value the pulse width modulation of the control
signal is varied over a prescribed interval.
