<ABSTRACT>
In a boiling water nuclear reactor fuel bundle (B), a 
debris catching arrangement is disclosed for incorporation 

within the flow plenum up stream or below the rod supporting 
grid (G) of the lower tie plate assembly (T). The device is 

preferably placed within the lower tie plate flow plenum 
between the fuel bundle inlet and the rod supporting grid 

structure (G) supporting the fuel rods (42); alternate placement can 
include any inlet channel upstream of the fuel rods (42) including 

the fuel support casting (C). The disclosed debris catching 

designs include strainer structures defining spatially 
separated straining or obstructing layers imparting to the 

fluid in the plenum a circuitous flow path. This circuitous 
flow path causes the two phase separation of the heavier 

debris from the lighter transporting water by flow direction 
change with the debris directed and detoured to a trapping 

structure. Further, a strainer structure is provided in the 
plenum that does not constitute a continuum of fine structure 

across the strained plenum which might become clogged to the 
extend that overall flow is restricted. The strainer 

structure is positioned so that eventual trapping of the 
debris occurs upon cessation of flow so that with removal of 

the plenum from the reactor, such as removal of the fuel 
bundle, the debris is likewise removed. Embodiments are 

disclosed which include swirling deflection, cone deflection, 
and strainer structure deflection of debris.

<DESCRIPTION>
In a boiling water nuclear reactor fuel bundle, a 
debris catching arrangement is disclosed for incorporation 
within a flow plenum up stream of the rod supporting grid of 
the lower tie plate assembly. The disclosed debris catching 
designs include the two phase separation of the heavier debris 
from the lighter transporting water by flow direction 
(momentum) change with the debris directed and detoured to a 
trapping structure. This allows for partial flow bypass 
around the trapping structure, to eliminate potential flow 
blockage concerns. Boiling water nuclear reactors operate for many 
years. Commencing with their initial construction and through 
their service lives, these reactors may accumulate debris in 
their closed circulation moderator systems. This debris can 
become an operating hazard if the debris is allowed to enter 
into the fuel bundle containing core region having the heat 
generating fuel rods. In order to understand this problem, a 
summary of reactor construction as it relates to the 
accumulation of debris needs first to be given. Thereafter, 
fuel bundle construction will be set forth. Emphasis will be 
given to the need to preserve substantially unchanged the 
regions of pressure drop along the flow paths. Thereafter, 
the effects caused by debris entering into the fuel rod region 
of the fuel bundles will be summarized. Boiling water nuclear reactor construction can be 
simply summarized for purposes of understanding the debris 
entrainment problem. Such nuclear reactors are provided with 
a large, central core. Liquid water coolant/moderator flow  
 
enters the core from the bottom and exits the core as a water 
steam mixture from the top. The core includes many side-by-side fuel bundles. 
Water is introduced into each fuel bundle through a fuel 
bundle support casting from a high pressure plenum which is 
situated below the core. Water passes in a distributed flow 
through the individual fuel bundles, is heated to generate 
steam, and exits the upper portion of the core as a two phase 
water steam mixture from which the steam is extracted for the 
generation of electricity. The core support castings and fuel bundle inlets are 
a source of pressure loss in the circulation of water through 
the core. This pressure loss assures the substantially even 
distribution of flow across the individual fuel bundles of the 
reactor core. When it is remembered that there are as many as 
750 individual fuel bundles in a reactor core, it can be 
appreciated that assurance of the
