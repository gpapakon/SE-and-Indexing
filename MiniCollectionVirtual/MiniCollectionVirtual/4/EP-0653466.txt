<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a 
powder coating excellent in storage stability and in coat 

surface smoothness. 
The present invention relates to a powder coating 
comprising a binder resin and a curing agent, characterized 

in that said curing agent has particle size characteristics 
such that the average particle size is 0.3 to 7µ m and 

particles having a particle size not smaller than 20µ m 
account for not less than 10% by weight of all curing agent 

particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a powder coating
excellent in coat film smoothness.The technology of coating substrates with a coating
material has advanced in the fields of automotive parts,
domestic electric appliances, building materials and the like
for the purpose of rust prevention, coloration, brightening
and so forth. In such coating, the substrate surface is
generally subjected to the steps of under coating,
intermediate coating, top coating, and the like to give a
finished product. Among coating materials used for these
coating steps, powder coatings in which no organic solvent is
used are free of the risk of environmental pollution and give
a good coat film appearance within a short curing time and,
accordingly, they have been widely used in recent years.Such powder coatings are produced, for instance, by
admixing a thermosetting resin serving as a binder resin with
a curing agent, a pigment and other additives, melting and
kneading the mixture under conditions such that the
crosslinking of resin molecules will not substantially proceed,
extruding the same in the form of pellets and pulverizing the
latter.The thus-produced powder coatings are applied to
substrates by such means as electrostatic spray coating or
fluidized dipping method, followed by a baking step to give
coat films.However, the conventional powder coatings tend to readily
undergo partial curing during the period between powder
coating production and application and thus few are fully
satisfactory from the storage stability viewpoint.
Furthermore, only a small proportion of finished coat films 
have satisfactory coat film characteristics, in particular
smoothness, luster, gloss, and the like.In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present
invention to provide a powder coating excellent in storage
stability and in coat surface smoothness.The gist of the invention lies in that, in a powder
coating comprising a binder resin and a curing agent, the
particle size characteristics of said curing agent are
adjusted such that the average particle size is 0.3 to 7µ m
and particles not less than 20µ m in particle size account for
not more than 10% by weight.The powder coating of the present invention comprises a
binder resin and a curing agent.The above-mentioned binder resin is not limited to any
particular species but includes, for example, normally solid
polymers, oligomers and polyfunctional low-molecular-weight
compounds of the acrylic, polyester or epoxy type, for
instance, that contain glycidyl, epoxy, carboxyl,
