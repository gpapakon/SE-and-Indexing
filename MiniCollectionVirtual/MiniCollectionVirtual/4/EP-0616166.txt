<ABSTRACT>
An integrated heated conduit includes an inner conduit (20) 
through which a fluid may be transferred. The inner conduit 

(20) may also serve as a first electrical conductor, or an 
insulator may be provided on the outer surface of the 

conduit (20) and a first electrical conductor (22) may then 
be formed about the outer surface of this insulator. A 

polymeric, self-regulating heating element (24) is provided 
on the outer surface of the first conductor (22). A second 

conductor (26) is provided about the outer surface of the 
heating element (24) to complete a current path across the 

heating element (24). The entire assembly may optionally be 
sheathed in an electrically and/or thermally insulating 

outer layer (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to conduits that are useful for transporting fluids. More
particularly, the present invention relates to the heating of such conduits to maintain
the contents thereof at a constant and/or elevated temperature.During transport through a conduit, the contents of the conduit may be subjected to a
wide range of temperatures, depending upon conduit location (e.g. controlled or
ambient environmental conditions), length of the conduit, fluid pressure within the
conduit, etc. These variations in temperature can affect the contents of the conduit,
such that a vapor component of the conduit's contents may condense, e.g. water
condensation may occur.Such vapor condensation is highly undesirable in most fluid transport applications.
For example, the liquid may freeze and disrupt fluid flow within the conduit or even
rupture the conduit, causing untold waste and creating serious environmental and 
health hazards. The liquid or partially frozen liquid may also be transferred through
the conduit and into processing equipment, adversely affecting equipment operation,
contaminating process constituents, or even damaging the equipment and/or work in
progress.To avoid the problems associated with vapor condensation, it is a common practice in
the semiconductor industry, for example, to heat the pipes that are used to transport
certain gases to and from processing equipment. The use of heat prevents water
vapor from condensing or freezing, and other undesired effects associated therewith.
For example, when water vapor is allowed to condense inside a mass flow controller
(MFC) the metering accuracy of the controller is adversely affected. In such event,
normal operation of the controller may only be obtained after the MFC is dried out.Such fluid heating is also helpful to maintain the fluids at a proper temperature, such
that state conversion, e.g. from gas to liquid, does not occur. For example, the
chemicals that are used in semiconductor processing, including water, may be less
hazardous or corrosive in a gaseous form than in a liquid form. For example, BBr3 is
corrosive when in liquid form but not corrosive in gaseous form. Thus, it is beneficial
to maintain such chemicals at an elevated temperature, at a corresponding
unsaturated vapor pressure.The state of the art for heating a conduit such that its contents are maintained at a
constant and/or elevated temperature consists of a heating cable or ribbon, such as is
manufactured by the Chemelex Division of Raychem Corporation, Menlo Park,
Cal
