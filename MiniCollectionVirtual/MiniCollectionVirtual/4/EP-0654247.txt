<ABSTRACT>
An endoscopic system (20) for performing endoscopic surgery at 
locations where tissue inserts into bone which includes a sleeve member 

(22), obturator (24), cutting (110) and excision instruments (160), and 
a marking and insertion assembly (230) wherein the sleeve member (22) 

has an expander portal (44) through which instrument access and improved 
visualization can be performed at arcuate lines of insertion of tissue 

into bone. The sleeve member (22) can include a flange (98) for engaging 
tissue along the line of insertion and exposing the bone and measurement 

means for gauging precisely the reduction or resection of bone. An 
alternative embodiment of the sleeve member (54) has a non-uniform 

aperture with an instrument portion (78) and a register portion (80) 
providing increased space and maneuverability for instruments when 

operating at the portal on tissue or bone that can include the flange. 
Cutting instruments (110) are provided with an extension portion to 

extravasate from tissue and palpitate underlying tissue. A marking and 
insertion assembly (230) for use in heel surgeries to remedy plantar 

fasciitis and in conjunction with a lateral radiograph provides precise 
location of an entry incision and precise medial to lateral insertion of 

a guide wire forming a channel for the sleeve member. The system also 
provides for minimal incision surgery in the caudal release of the 

plantar fascia and reduction of a spur on the os calcis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to endoscopic surgery at 
locations in the body where tissue inserts into bone and 
more particularly to a method and system of performing 
endoscopic heel surgery. Various techniques and systems for performing endoscopic 
surgery in the body have been developed. These systems 
provide instrument access and visualisation of tissue 
targeted by a specific operation. Advances have been made 
at locations in the body where a natural channel or simple 
pathway can be formed by a tube having a slot or opening 
for identifying and operating on the target tissue. 
However, at other locations in the body these known methods 
and systems for endoscopic surgery have problems providing 
access and visualisation at or near a line of insertion of 
tissue to bone. Problems occur because most bones have an 
arcuate surface with the corresponding line of insertion 
curving away from the opening resulting in the diminished 
reach of an instrument and imaging of an endoscope. Other 
disadvantages of known systems include diminished 
visualisation of deep cuts in thick tissues, the ability to 
identify and operate on adjacent tissues often requiring 
repositioning of the tube. Furthermore, a repositioned tube 
may not provide the needed access or visualisation of the 
specific operation. Repositioning has other disadvantages 
including requiring additional surgical time and 
procedures, larger incisions to manoeuvre the tube, and 
increased likelihood of damage to tissue or the like. Thus,  
 
the development of method and system for use in endoscopic 
surgery of these arcuate bone surfaces and lines of 
insertion without the disadvantages of known methods and 
systems would advance the state of the art. In addition, these known endoscopic techniques and systems 
have not solved problems of the particular environment of 
the bone and tissue in the foot. As the human foot is the 
foundation for most movement, foot pain and discomfort can 
cripple and seriously reduce such movement. Typically, 
adverse foot mechanisms coupled with factors such as 
obesity or various types of traumatic motion can lead to a 
painful heel syndrome or plantar fasciitis with or without 
a spur forming on the os calcis. The pain is located at 
which the plantar fascia inserts into the medial and/or 
lateral tubercle of the os calcis. The insertion site 
follows an arcuate surface of the os calcis that may have a 
radial component extending distally form both tubercles 
with a predilection towards the medial aspect of
