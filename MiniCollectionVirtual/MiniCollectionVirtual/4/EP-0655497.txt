<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a novel DNA sequence coding for an Aspergillus aspartic
protease, an Aspergillus aspartic protease per se and a method for the preparation thereof.
The invention further concerns a novel Aspergillus mutant strain defective in a aspartic
protease, which is useful for the expression of heterologous protein, and a method for the
preparation of such a mutant strain.Aspergillus species, and in particular Aspergillus niger, are used for the industrial
production of enzymes used in the food processing industry. A. niger has advantages as a
host for the production of recombinant proteins because of its large capacity for secretion
of proteins, and because systems are available for its molecular genetic manipulation.
However, the presence of proteases in the culture fluid, periplasmic space or endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi apparatus has proven deleterious to the expression of heterologous
proteins in A.niger; in fact Aspergilli are used commercially to produce proteases. A
number of extracellular proteases from Aspergilli have been described in the literature.
The gene pepA encoding aspergillopepsin A from Aspergillus awamori has recently been
cloned. The pepA gene product accounts for a major part of the secreted acid proteases of
A. niger and strains in which the pepA gene has been deleted have allowed increased
expression of heterologous proteins in A. niger var. awamori. Other protease genes have
also been recently cloned from Aspergilli and these include an alkaline aspartic protease
of A. oryzae, an alkaline aspartic protease of A. fumigatus, a non-pepsin type acid
protease from A. niger var.macrosporus, a metalloprotease called neutral protease II from
A.oryzae, and two serine proteases from A. niger.Isolated and mutated protease genes of A. niger can be used for gene disruption
experiments, i.e. the preparation of mutant strains in which the corresponding natural gene
is destroyed. For example, the pepA gene from Aspergillus awamori has been destroyed
by gene disruption in order to prepare aspergillopepsin A deficient strains.However, as mentioned above Aspergilli produce a large number of different proteases
and, thus, there is a continuing need for Aspergillus strains deficient in other proteases for 
the industrial production of proteins. For this purpose there is also a need for other
protease genes which can be used for the preparation of protease deficient strains by in
vitro mutagenesis, e.g. gene disruption. Moreover, there is also a need for recombinant
protease
