<ABSTRACT>
A fuel pumping apparatus of the rotary distributor type includes a 
distributor member (12) having a delivery passage (21) which can 

communicate with outlet ports in turn to distribute fuel to the injection 
nozzles of an engine in turn. The distributor member also includes a 

balance passage (50) which can also register with the outlet ports in turn. 
The balance passage communicates with a source of fuel so that 

intermediate deliveries of fuel to each outlet, the pressure in that outlet is 
reduced to that of the source.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to a 
multi-cylinder compression ignition engine and of the kind comprising a 
housing, a rotary distributor member journalled in the housing, a 
plurality of outlet ports formed in the housing and opening onto the 
periphery of the distributor member at angularly spaced positions about 
the axis of rotation thereof, a plurality of outlets in the housing, said 
outlets being connected by outlet passages to the outlet ports respectively 
and in use being connected to respective injection nozzles of an 
associated engine, a high pressure fuel pump in the housing, said high 
pressure fuel pump including a pumping chamber and a cam actuated 
pumping plunger which is driven inwardly in timed relationship with the 
associated engine, to pressurise the fuel in said pumping chamber, a 
delivery passage in the distributor member, the delivery passage 
communicating with the pumping chamber and being arranged to 
register in turn with the outlet ports so that fuel is supplied to the 
injection nozzles in turn during successive inward movements of the 
pumping plunger, means for controlling the quantity of fuel delivered to 
the engine, and a low pressure pump for supplying fuel to the pumping 
chamber during the outward movement of the pumping plunger, the low 
pressure pump including a rotor. An example of such an apparatus is seen in EP-A-0383546 in which the 
pump member is in the form of a pair of plungers which are driven 
inwardly by the action of cam lobes formed on the internal peripheral 
surface of a cam ring. The bore which accommodates the plungers is 
formed in the rotary distributor member and the apparatus includes a 
spill valve operable during inward movement of the plungers to spill fuel  
 
from the pumping chamber thereby to terminate the delivery of fuel to 
the associated engine. The pressure at which fuel is being supplied to modern engines tends to 
be increasing in order to satisfy exhaust emission requirements. 
Furthermore, in order to ensure rapid closure of the pressure actuated 
valves in the fuel injection nozzles again to minimise pollutants in the 
engine exhaust, the flow area of the spill valve is such as to ensure a 
rapid reduction in the pressure in the pumping chamber and therefore in 
the connected outlet port, outlet, the pipeline which is connected 
between the outlet and the fuel injection nozzle, and the fuel injection 
nozzle itself. The rapid reverse flow of fuel can lead to over or under 
pressurisati

A fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to a multi-cylinder 
compression ignition engine comprising a housing (10, 11), a rotary 

distributor member (12) journalled in the housing, a plurality of outlet 
ports (22) formed in the housing and opening onto the periphery of the 

distributor member at angularly spaced positions about the axis of 
rotation thereof, a plurality of outlets (23) in the housing, said outlets 

being connected by outlet passages (22A) to the outlet ports (22) 
respectively and in use being connected to respective injection nozzles 

of an associated engine, a high pressure fuel pump in the housing, said 
high pressure fuel pump including a pumping chamber and a cam 

actuated pumping plunger (14) which is driven inwardly in timed 
relationship with the associated engine, to pressurise the fuel in the 

pumping chamber, a delivery passage (21) in the distributor member, the 
delivery passage communicating with the pumping chamber and being 

arranged to register in turn with the outlet ports (22) so that fuel is 
supplied to the injection nozzles in turn during successive inward 

movements of the pump member (14), means (34) for controlling the 
quantity of fuel delivered to the engine and a low pressure pump (27) for 

supplying fuel to the pumping chamber during the outward movement of 
the pump member (14) the low pressure pump including a rotor (51), 

characterised by a balance passage (50) formed in the distributor member 
(12) and opening onto the periphery of the distributor member to register 

in turn with said outlet ports (22), said balance passage communicating 
with a source of fuel whereby intermediate successive de
liveries of fuel 
through each outlet port, the outlet port will be brought into register with 

 
said balance passage so that the pressure at the outlet port will be 

stabilized at the pressure of said source of fuel. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that said 
source of fuel is near the distributor member. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, in which said rotor (51) is 
secured to one end of the distributor member to rotate therewith, 

characterised in that said balance passage (50) communicates with a 
space defined in the rotor, said space containing fuel under pressure and 

forming said source of fuel. 
An apparatus according to Claim 3, in which said delivery 
passage (21) is located adjacent said one end of the distributor member 

characterised in that the balance passage (50) opens onto the periphery 
of the distributor member in the same axial plane as the delivery passage 

and extends within the distributor member at an angle to the axis of 
rotation thereof to said end of the distributor member. 
An apparatus according to Claim 3, characterised in that said 
space is in communication with the outlet of the low pressure pump (27) 

and that the communication of the balance passage (50) with an outlet 
port (22) takes place only during the period of communication of the 

delivery passage (21) with another outlet port.
