<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
sequential removal of monosaccharides from
oligosaccharides. This invention is more particularly
related to methods for the sequential removal of
monosaccharides from the reducing end of oligosaccharides;
the use of such methods to enable new structures to be
generated from pre-existing oligosaccharides and for
structural determinations of oligosaccharides; and the
incorporation of such methods into automated systems.Saccharides (also known as sugars or
carbohydrates), amino acids, fatty acids and nucleotides
comprise the more major building blocks of biological
macromolecules such as oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids
and nucleic acids, respectively. Due to the diversity
within a group of building blocks, such as saccharides for
example, and, and the variety of ways in which to order the
building blocks of a group or groups, large numbers of
structurally distinct biologicals macromolecules are
possible. Oligosaccharides alone, for example, are a group
of biological polymers which comprise an extremely diverse
group of molecules. Oligosaccharides exist as individual
compounds as well as components of larger compounds. For
example, a combination of an oligosaccharide and a protein
is termed a glycoprotein. Similarly, a combination of an
oligosaccharide and a lipid is termed a glycolipid.
Oligosaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids have a
large number of functions in nature. For example, these 
macromolecules in general, and their saccharide components
in specific, serve as recognition molecules in a wide
variety of normal and abnormal biological processes,
including cancer and inflammation.EP-A-215 766 discloses a method for the isolation
of unreduced oligosaccharides of glycoproteins and
glycohormones having N-linked oligosaccharide structure.
The method employs hydrazinolysis of the glycoprotein or
glycohormone under reaction conditions to cause cleavage at
the N-linked sites, producing a mixture including amino
acid hydrazines and a de-N-acetylated hydrazone derivative
of the oligosaccharides.Because of the critical importance of
oligosaccharides, alone or in combination with other
molecules, there has been great interest in determining the
structures of oligosaccharides and in making new
oligosaccharides as well as portions of known
oligosaccharides. An oligosaccharide is composed of
individual saccharides, also known as monosaccharides.
Typically, monosaccharides possess five carbon atoms
(pentoses), six carbon atoms 
(hexoses), or are variants
