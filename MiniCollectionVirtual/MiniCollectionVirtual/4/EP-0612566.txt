<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device (1) for delivering powdery solids in suspension in a gas onto a moving substrate (3), especially a glass tape, this device comprising two walls delimiting a strip-shaped cavity (2) arranged transversely to the direction of movement of the substrate and ending, near the substrate, in a delivery slit (4). This cavity (2) is equipped with at least one partition (7) arranged so as to compartmentalise it longitudinally, each of the compartments (5, 6) being equipped with powdery-solid injection means (8) and with pressurised-gas injection means (10).

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (1) for the distribution of pulverulent solids suspended in a 
gas on a moving substrate (3), particularly a ribbon of glass, said apparatus 

having two walls defining a strip-like cavity (2) positioned transversely to 
the movement direction of the substrate and ending in the vicinity of the 

substrate in a distribution slot (4), characterized in that said cavity (2) 
is equipped with at least one partition (7) positioned so as to longitudinally 

compartmentalize it, each of the compartments (5, 6) being equipped with 
pulverulent solid injection means (8) and pressurized gas injection means 

(10). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the position of 
the partition (7) in the cavity (2) can be regulated, particularly as regards 

height. 
Apparatus according to either of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the partition (7) has a solid or hollow construction and is in particular 

formed with the aid of metal plates. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the partition (7) defines two parallel walls, or walls which are at 

least partly divergent or convergent in the direction of the substrate. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the edges of the walls defined by the partition (7) in the vicinity of 

the substrate (3) are rounded. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that it has a partition (7) subdividing the cavity (2) into two symmetrical 

compartments (5, 6). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the partition (7) is flush with the distribution slot (4).  

 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the partition (7) is provided with rigidifying elements and in particular 

tie rods located outside the cavity (2). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the pulverulent solid injection means supplying each of the compartments 

(5, 6) have a plurality of supply pipes (8) positioned longitudinally to the 
cavity (2). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the pressurized gas injection means equipping each of the compartments 

comprise chambers (11, 12) supplied with pressurized gas and issuing into the 
said compartments (5, 6) by openings (10) arranged so as to inject the gas 

in the direction of the substrate (3), said openings (10) being in the form 
of slots optionally connected to the chambers (11, 20) by porous plates (23) 

or apertures, which are in particular made in the plates (13). 
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterized in that the openings (10) 
by which the pressured gases are injected into the compartments (5, 6) are 

arranged so as to introduce said gases substantially parallel to the wall 
adjacent to said openings (10). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that at least one of the compartments (5, 6) is provided with a supplementary 

gas and in particular ambient air intake (9), particularly in the vicinity of 
the pulverulent solid injection means (8).
