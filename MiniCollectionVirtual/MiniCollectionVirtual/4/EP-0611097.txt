<ABSTRACT>
An optical source includes a semiconductor diode laser (10), an external 
optical cavity (170), and a source of drive current. The external cavity includes an 

optical fiber (50) and a distributed Bragg reflector (160). The distributed Bragg 

reflector is chirped. As a consequence, the optical source exhibits self-tuning 
behavior.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical systems of the kind in which a 
semiconductor diode laser has an optical cavity that is at least partially external to 
the diode structure. For long-distance optical fiber communication, it is desirable to provide 
a source of transform-limited optical pulses which is compact, reliable and stable, 
and which operates at an appropriate wavelength and repetition rate. In particular, it 
is currently believed that for soliton-based communication, a wavelength of about 
1.55 µm, a pulse width of 15 - 60 ps, and a repetition rate roughly in the range of 2.5 
- 10 GHz are desirable. Actively mode-locked, semiconductor diode lasers are 
advantageously used as sources of optical pulses for such purposes. However, there 
are several problems associated with the conventional use of external air cavities for 
mode-locking. Such cavities generally require the use of bulk optics, a diffraction 
grating for wavelength control, and an etalon for bandwidth control. As a 
consequence, optical alignment is a complicated and difficult matter, and it is 
difficult to provide a cavity which is compact enough for general use in optical 
communication. As an alternative, monolithic mode-locked lasers have been 
proposed. Such lasers are described, for example, in P.A. Morton, et al., 'Monolithic 
hybrid mode-locked 1.3 µm semiconductor lasers', Appl.Phys.Lett.56 (1990) 111 - 
113. However, the small physical dimensions of such devices permit operation only 
at repetition rates which are relatively high, and generally greater than preferred 
maximum rates for purposes of data transmission. Moreover, some such devices 
lack adequate bandwidth control to produce relatively long pulses which are 
transform limited. Although not generally useful for producing communication signals, 
continuously operated semiconductor diode lasers have ubiquitous applications. 
However, one common problem that has been encountered in the cw operation of 
these lasers is so-called 'mode beating noise', which causes the output power to 
fluctuate. For at least certain applications of these lasers, it is desirable to provide 
means for stabilizing the cw optical output. Described herein is an optical source which is compact, stable, and 
reliable, and which, when used as a pulse source, can provide at least approximately 
transform-limited optical pulses at appropriate wavelengths, repetition rates, and  
 
pulse widths for soliton-based communication. (Soliton-based signal transmission is 
described, e.g., in L.F.
