<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pen (1) for applying a fast colour or covering composition, having a cylindrical sleeve (2) which exhibits a plunger (piston) (8), which can be moved axially with the aid of a rotatable threaded spindle (12), and a chamber (4) which is delimited by said plunger and by a removable cap (5) and is intended for receiving the composition. In the case of said pen, in order to simplify the production, the composition can be introduced in liquid or pasty form, through that end of the sleeve (2) which is provided for the installation of the plunger (8) and threaded spindle (12), into the chamber (4) which is closed off by the cap (5), and, after the composition has been introduced through that end of the sleeve (2) which is opposite the cap (5), the plunger (8), connected to the threaded spindle (12), can be introduced into said sleeve.
