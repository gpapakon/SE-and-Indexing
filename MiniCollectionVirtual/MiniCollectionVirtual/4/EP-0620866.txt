<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a wear surface on a base structure, the wear surface comprising a metal layer having distributed therein at least one solid, filler characterized by the steps of: 1) providing a self-supporting substrate having at least parts of one surface capable of intimately bonding with said layer; 2) applying the layer to said one surface by a high temperature spray technique selected from flame spraying, plasma spraying and arc spraying; and 3) thereafter securing the substrate to the base structure with a surface opposed to the one surface in contact therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the provision of a wear surface 
on a base structure. In this specification the term "wear surface" has been used 
to include such a surface applied to a base structure to 
protect the structure from physical damage in arduous 
industrial conditions and/or to provide the base structure 
with an anti-skid surface to enhance the safety of 
operatives walking thereon or to improve the traction of 
vehicles. Such wear surfaces are commonplace in factories, 
shopping centres and in many other places. The base 
structure may, for example be a concrete floor or it may be 
a metal base plate. In general anti-skid surfaces are made deliberately rough 
whereas surfaces to protect the structure from damage do 
not need a rough finish. Both kinds of surface may be of 
the same composition; variation in texture being obtained 
by differences in the way the surface is applied. In EP 0331519A there is disclosed a method of producing a 
corrosion and mechanical wear resistant coating on a metal 
surface to be protected which comprises (a) providing a rod 
or wire formed of a metal matrix composite comprising a 
metal matrix having distributed therein a finely divided 
solid filler material and (b) applying a coating of said 
metal matrix composite on said metal surface to be 
protected by means of a flame spraying or arc spraying 
process. The use of these proposals would be entirely satisfactory 
in many installations with the coating applied to metal 
base plates already incorporated in the installations.  
 Should the wear surface need replacement or repair this can 
be done on site by re-spraying. Alternatively a damaged 
base plate could be replaced even, as in some 
installations, where such a base plate may be a heavy steel 
structure up to 5 metres long and two metres wide, by using 
appropriate lifting apparatus. However the prior proposals would not be appropriate for an 
installation which cannot be shut down or which is located 
in an environment where techniques involving high 
temperatures and naked flames cannot be used and where all 
risk of generating sparks must be avoided. Such an installation may for example be an oil rig or 
support platform to be located at sea or installations such 
as refineries or petroleum product storage facilities. In 
such circumstances it would not be possible to use the 
process of EP 0331519A on an operational oil rig. It would 
also not be possible to replace a damaged steel base plate 
on site. Nevertheless it is very desirable that damaged

A method of forming a wear surface on a base 
structure, the wear surface comprising a metal layer having 

distributed therein at least one solid, filler 
characterised by the steps of:- 


1. providing a self-supporting substrate having at 
least parts of one surface capable of intimately 

bonding with said layer, 
2. applying the layer to said one surface by a high 
temperature spray technique selected from flame 

spraying, plasma spraying and arc spraying, and 
3. thereafter securing the substrate to the base 
structure with a surface opposed to the one 

surface in contact therewith. 
A method according to claim 1 in which the metal layer 
is of aluminium or an aluminium alloy. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which the 
base structure is a ferrous base plate. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3 in 
which the substrate is a metal tile or strip having said 

one surface physically abraded or chemically or thermally 
treated to enhance bonding of the layer. 
A method according to claim 4 in which the substrate 
is of an aluminium alloy. 
A method according to claim 5 in which the substrate 
is of a thin, ductile aluminium alloy so that after 

application of the layer thereon it can be formed to follow  
 

irregularities in the base plate. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims 
in which the substrate is stuck to the base structure. 
A method according to claim 7 in which the substrate 
is stuck with an adhesive that contributes to the physical 

properties of the structural unit comprising the substrate, 
the adhesive and the base structure. 
A method according to claim 8 in which the adhesive 
has such characteristics that the substrate may readily be 

peeled away from the base structure to permit easy 
replacement. 
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 9 in 
which the adhesive is a two part cold setting adhesive the 

parts being mixed and applied to the substrate or the base 
plate. 
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 9 in 
which the adhesive is a non-curing pressure-sensitive 

adhesive. 
A method according to claim 11 in which the adhesive 
is selected from a moisture curing polyurethane; a two part 

acrylic a two part epoxy or a two part epoxy hybrid. 
A method according to claim 5 and claim 8 in which the

together by electrically conducting particles incorporated 
in the adhesive so that when the base plate is of a ferrous 

alloy and is located in an electrolyte an aluminium alloy 
substrate constitutes a sacrificial anode therefor.

material incorporating particles or fibres to 
which the layer is capable of bonding.

A method according to claim 14 in which the substrate 
is itself a one component heat settable adhesive. 
A method according to claim 14 in which the substrate

vehicle wheels passing thereover.
