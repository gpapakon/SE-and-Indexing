<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid 
dispensing system specifically designed to deliver 
multidose sterile, or homogenized and pasteurized, 
chemical preservative, antibacterial or antimicrobial 
additive free (hereinafter known collectively as 
"preservative free") solutions. More, specifically, the 
present invention is directed to a fluid dispensing 
system with a dual self-sealing valve system to dispense 
multidose sterile solutions in a dropwise form. The 
dual self-sealing valve system and hydrophobic air 
filter protects the solutions from contamination after 
multidose dispensing without the use of preservatives. Large number of solutions including those that 
are sold and administered as over-the-counter ("OTC") 
and/or prescription preparations, such as ophthalmic 
pharmaceutical, contact lens solutions, drop-administrated 
medicines for the ear or nose, and some 
consumer health care liquid solutions, such as creams, 
gels and lotions, must be kept sterile to prevent 
contamination from bacteria or other microbes. The 
conventional means of preventing such contamination is 
to add a preservative or other antibacterial agent to 
the solution during packaging. Commonly used 
preservatives include benzalkonium chloride, methyl 
parabens, propyl parabens, thimerosal and chlorobutanol. 
Commonly used antibacterial agents include saline 
formulations. While these preservatives keep the 
enclosed solution sterile, the bottle itself may harbor  
 
external bacterial or microbial growth which is carried 
along with the outflow of fluids. In addition, the 
preservatives themselves are often toxic, not just to 
bacteria or microbes, but also to the cells which are 
being treated by the bottled solution. For example, the 
preservatives used in most eye drops can disrupt the 
corneal epithelium, irritate conjunctival tissues and 
cause allergic reactions. Because of this toxicity 
level, continued use can cause more long-term problems 
than the solutions solve. Furthermore, squeezable dispensing bottles 
containing saline formulations in the dispensing liquids 
may be provided with nozzles including filter membranes 
which are permeable to the dispensed liquid as well as 
being permeable to the air which must be aspirated 
through the nozzle to replace the dispensed liquid and 
reinflate or re-expand the container. However, the 
filter membrane must be impermeable to bacteria in order 
to prevent the aspirated air from carrying bacteria into 
contact with the stored solution, and contaminating the

<CLAIMS>
A fluid dispensing system (10) for 
dispensing sterile preservative free solution (20) 

comprising: 

a container (12) having an outer surface (14) 
and an inner surface (16); 
said container (12) being elastically 
deformable; 
said container further having a reservoir 
compartment (18) for storing a sterile solution and a 

tip compartment (22) adapted to dispense the sterile 
solution; 
a dual self-sealing valve dispensing assembly 
(24) sealed to the inside surface of said tip 

compartment;

wherein said hydrophobic membrane (34) is suitable for  

 
resisting the passage of bacterial and microbial 

contamination and has a surface area of about 0.1 
to about 0.2 cm
2
. 
A fluid dispensing system of claim 10, 
wherein said hydrophobic membrane (34) is suitable for 

resisting the passage of bacterial and microbial 
contamination and has a surface area of about 0.13 cm
2
. 
A fluid dispensing system of claim 11, 
wherein said system outlet (66) is further provided with 

a cap (70) having bayonet extension means (72) which 
displaces residual fluid and hermetically seals said 

outlet upon closure. 
A fluid dispensing system of claim 12, 
wherein said cap is further provided with antislip 

knurls (74) and threads (76) for sealing to said outlet. 
A fluid dispensing system of claim 13, 
wherein said cap (70) is further rendered bactericidal 

and bacteriostatic with an agent selected from the group 
consisting of silver oxide, gold oxide and copper oxide.
