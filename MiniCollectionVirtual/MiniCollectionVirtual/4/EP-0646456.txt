<ABSTRACT>
A plasticizer machine including a portal framework (A,B,C) formed of 
a first column (A) or upright in which the assembly for spreading a 

solventless adhesive and the feeding reel of the transparent film are 
located, a horizontal raised beam (C) in which the transparent film 

slides on drive rollers and the adhesive thereon is dried, a second 
column (B) or upright in which the film with the adhesive runs downwards 

to a device for wetting the film and/or the paper substrate from a pile 
or a reel and then is passed to a pair of rollers coupling the film to 

the paper substrate, and an engraving, cutting, tearing and stacking 
assembly for the plasticized sheets located between the two uprights 

under said raised path of the framework.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for automatically
applying a transparent film generally of polypropylene
to a face of a paper substrate (paper or cardboard) in
the form of single sheets or a continuos band.The above-mentioned operation well-known to those skilled
in the art under the name of "plasticization" finds a number
of applications in several fields above all in the
publishing trade and in the manufacture of paper and cardboard
articles, and the spread thereof is due to the
greatest extent to the improvement of the aesthetic and
functional features of the paper material such as gloss,
moisture-repellent capability, tearing strength, and
scuffing resistance.In a previous European Patent No. 443 298 of
the same Applicant there is described and illustrated a
plasticizer machine which couples a transparent film to a
paper substrate without using any solvent, which avoids
all troubles relative to the presence of said solvent
such as the need of an evaporation tunnel, suction and
filtering systems, hot air generators, and generally all
technical measures aimed at avoiding or at least reducing
pollution and fire risks.
The present invention seeks to further improve the construction 
and the operation of the machine described in
the European Patent Application mentioned above, without
prejudice to the inventive steps of the latter.
In particular, the present invention seeks to solve definitively
the problem of the presence of dusts used to
avoid setoff in a plasticizer machine which couples a
plastic film to a printed paper substrate in the form of
single sheets or a coil by means of a solventless adhesive.
As known to those skilled in the art, under the term means
to avoid setoff there is intended the dusts of generally
vegetal origin which are normally used in typography to
avoid setoff, i.e. the print that the freshly printed
pages leaves on the sheets brought into contact therewith.
However, the use of such dusts influences negatively the
plasticization because it is quite easy that an amount of
grains is adherent to the sheet until the coupling to the
plastic film, with the quite unaesthetic result that the
plasticized product is spotted and dirty.
A number of approaches have been made to avoid such
trouble, however, without any satisfying result. For example,
several mechanical cleaning devices using brushes or
cleaning contact rollers are known such as the British
patent GB-A-2 223 445 where the dusts adhering to
the surface of the sheet is removed by a cleaning roller
coated with

<CLAIMS>
A plasticizer machine for applying a transparent film
to a paper substrate by means of solventless adhesives,

comprising a portal construction formed of two columns or
uprights (A,B) connected by a horizontal raised beam (C);

a paper substrate feeding assembly aligned with said
portal construction; a reel (10) for feeding the

transparent film (12); an adhesive spreading roller
assembly (11) for applying an evenly distributed

controlled amount of solventless adhesive to a face of the
film (12), and a set of guide rollers (13);

said reel, spreading roller, and guide rollers
being housed in

the first upright or colums (A); a set of rollers (14)
rotatably mounted on the horizontal raised beam, for

transporting the film with the adhesive face oriented
upwards from the first column or upright to the second

column or upright; means (15) for passing the film
downwards along the second column or upright; and coupling

rollers (16) housed in the second column or upright for
coupling the film to a paper substrate formed of single

sheets or a continuous strip, characterized by further
comprising an engraving, cutting and tearing assembly

(22,23,24) for the plasticized sheets, which assembly is
aligned with the longitudinal axis of the machine and

housed under said horizontal raised beam and between the
first and second columns or uprights; and means (30-32,38)

for wetting with water or a water solution the face of the
film carrying the adhesive

and/or the printed surface of said paper substrate
so that any dust to avoid

setoff on said printed surface of the paper substrate can 
be removed, said means being located before the coupling

rollers (16).
The machine of claim 1 , characterized in that said
wetting means includes at least a roller (30) wetted with

water or a water solution and located so as to wet by
contact said face of the film carrying the adhesive.
The machine of claims 1 and 2, characterized in that
said wetting means includes an atomizer (38) capable of

spraying the printed surface of the paper substrate.
The machine of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the
coupling operation is performed by a pair of rollers (16)

located downstream of a set of tension adjusting rollers
(15) located on the second upright (B).
The machine of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the
the paper substrate is piled up in single sheets placed in

an automatic sheet feeder (18) located beside the second
column (B) in line with the machine and intended to feed

in succession the sheets to said coupling rollers (16).
The machine of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the
continuous film band applied to said succession of sheets

by the coupling rollers (16) is directly fed to the
engraving, cutting and tearing assembly (22,23,24) located

under the raised beam (C). 
The machine of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that
said engraving, cutting and tearing assem
bly includes
pressure rollers (23), drive and guide rollers (22), and a

cutting assembly (24) which cuts the plasticized sheets
and feeds them to an automatic stacker (25).
The machine of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the
continuos film band with the sheets applied in succession

is taken up onto a reel (20A) which in turn can be located
on a support shaft mounted in said engraving, cutting and

tearing assembly (22,23,24).
The machine of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the
engraving, cutting and tearing assembly is provided with a

baffle plate (26) to reject any defective sheet before the
final piling up.
