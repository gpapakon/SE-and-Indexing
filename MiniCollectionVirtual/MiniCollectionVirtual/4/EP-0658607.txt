<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink, in
particular, an ink suitable for use in recording on media
lacking in ink absorptiveness, and an ink-jet recording
method using such an ink and ink-jet instruments applying
the ink thereto.Inks for ink-jet recording apparatus in which a
liquid ink is ejected from a nozzle of a head to make
printing include water-based inks in which a dye as a
coloring material is dissolved in an aqueous solvent, and
solid inks in which a dye is dissolved in a waxy solvent
setting at ordinary temperatur to eject the solid solution
from a head in a state melted under heat.Ink-jet recording inks of the ultraviolet-curing
type include those using a water-soluble dye as described
in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 5-186725, by
which printing on plain paper and regenerated paper can be
conducted with ease.As a method of forming images on a plastic sheet or
plate, a sublimable dye is used in an ultraviolet-curing
resin as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
No. 52-142516.The following problems are however involved in the
prior art.
1. In case the water-based ink is used in color
printing, for example, when printing is conducted with an
ink of the first color and then with another ink of the
second color after the first ink is dried, the first color
ink is redissolved in the second color ink if the dots of
the second color ink overlaps the dots of the first color
ink, whereby bleeding occurs, and the quality of the
resulting print is hence deteriorated.2. Since the water-based ink makes good use of
penetrability of the solvent into paper, it takes a lot of
time to dry the ink, and moreover images good in rub-off
resistance cannot be formed if a plastic is used as a
recording medium. Media intended for recording are
therefore limited to paper.3. In the ink in which an ultraviolet-curing resin
is mixed with a water-soluble dye, the dye does not bleed
if water is applied again to the ink after printing.
However, it is unavoidable to fade the color of the dye by
the irradiation of ultraviolet light.4. In the solid ink, any recording medium can be
applied. However, since a soft material, or a wax is
used, printed dots thereof are readily rubbed off even by
weak frictional force. In general, inks containing an 
organic solvent develop the solvent-like odor, and hence
offer an environmental problem.5. The ink in which a sublimable dye is used in an
ultraviolet-curing resin is required to heat to 120°C to
180°C. Therefore, recording media to be used are limited.EP-A-0
