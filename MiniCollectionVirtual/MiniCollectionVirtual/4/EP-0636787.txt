<ABSTRACT>
The field of application of the invention is systems in which the liquid is conveyed in one case against a higher pressure, and flows in the other case in the same direction as a pressure gradient. For this purpose, the invention utilises a unit (set) consisting of a centrifugal (gyro) machine which is operated alternately as a pump or as a turbine, and one or more machines which serve the purpose of driving the centrifugal machine in pump operation and of accommodating the output power of the centrifugal machine in turbine operation. The unit according to the invention is distinguished from known units of this type which are known in principle by the fact that the pump operation and the turbine operation of the centrifugal machine are performed with the same flow direction (14).
