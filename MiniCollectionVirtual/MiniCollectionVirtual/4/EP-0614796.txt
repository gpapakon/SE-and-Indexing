<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle steering arrangement (1) is provided which allows 
a greater normal steering lock to be embodied in vehicle 

manufacture while avoiding fouling of the steerable road 
wheels (14) on the vehicle body or other vehicle part with 

the wheels in the full hang position and/or with the vehicle 
heavily laden. The latter conditions identify certain of 

pre-selected angles which the steering tie rods (6) make 
respectively with the axis line of the steering rods (7), to 

which the tie rods (6) are hingedly attached, as may be 
driven eg by a rack and pinion. At such angles the radial 

extensions (9) provided on the tie rods (6) are dimensioned 
to come into abutting contact with the optionally profiled 

secondary stop means (8) to prevent the steering rods (7) 
from reaching their fully retracted positions when maximum 

lock is applied to the steering.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a steering arrangement for the 
road wheels of a motor vehicle. The demands for high manoeuvrability of motor vehicles and 
particularly motor cars and commercial vehicles have always 
been high but vehicle bodywork design has sometimes imposed 
limitations on the scope of the steering lock to avoid 
fouling of the wheels or tyres on the bodywork or other 
vehicle part at the extremes of the steering lock. The risk of such fouling has therefore been of some concern 
to the motor industry and the aim has been to control 
vehicle manufacture such that when a steerable wheel is in 
the full hang position, that is with the wheel off the road 
and hanging freely from its associated vehicle suspension, 
no fouling will occur at either extremity of the steering 
lock. It has also been an aim to avoid fouling at steering 
lock extremities when the vehicle is heavily laden. These aims have imposed serious limitations on steering lock 
scope while the demands for high manoeuvrability have 
increased as a consequence of greater congestion on the 
roads. US Patent Specification 4 536 003 describes a mechanism for 
limiting the steering movement of a steering wheel. Another mechanism is described in patent document 
DE 2 752 570 A1. This discloses a mechanism which 
progressively limits the steering movement of a steering 
wheel according to the degree of wheel hang. The features 
of the pre-characterising part of Claim 1 are known from 
this document.  
 According to the present invention there is provided a 
steering arrangement for a motor vehicle, the arrangement 
comprising a steering rod reciprocable within a steering 
housing in a direction transverse of the vehicle to effect 
steering movement of a pair of road wheels, the steering rod 
being connected to steering arms on the road wheels by tie 
rods connected to opposite ends of the steering rod and to 
the arms by universal joints, the tie rods each having a 
radial extension to limit the scope of steering lock, 
characterised in that the steering rod has a projection 
positioned so that it will come into abutting contact with 
primary stop means to limit the scope of steering lock when 
the tie rod is in line with the steering rod, and in that 
the radial extension will come into abutting contact with 
secondary stop means to limit the scope of steering lock 
when the tie rod is at a pre-selected angle above or below 
the steering rod, the scope of steering lock being greater 
when the scope is limited by the projection and

<CLAIMS>
A steering arrangement for a motor vehicle, the 
arrangement comprising a steering rod (7) reciprocable 

within a steering housing (3) in a direction transverse of 
the vehicle to effect steering movement of a pair of road 

wheels (14), the steering rod (7) being connected to 
steering arms (15) on the road wheels by tie rods (6) 

connected to opposite ends of the steering rod (7) and to 
the arms by universal joints (5), the tie rods (6) each 

having a radial extension (9) to limit the scope of steering 
lock, characterised in that the steering rod (7) has a 

projection (11) positioned so that it will come into 
abutting contact with primary stop means (10) to limit the 

scope of steering lock when the tie rod (6) is in line with 
the steering rod (7), and in that the radial extension (9) 

will come into abutting contact with secondary stop means 
(8) to limit the scope of steering lock when the tie rod is 

at a pre-selected angle above or below the steering rod, the 
scope of steering lock being greater when the scope is 

limited by the projection (11) and primary stop means (10) 
than when the scope is limited by the radial extension (9) 

and secondary stop means (8). 
A steering arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the projection is a shoulder (11) on 

the steering rod (7) and the primary stop means is an inner 
shoulder of the housing (10). 
A steering arrangement as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterised in that the universal joint connecting a tie 

rod to the steering rod is a ball joint (5) with a socket 
that is formed within the shoulder (11) on the steering rod 

(7).  
 
A steering arrangement as claimed in any one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterised in that the secondary stop means is a 

component (8) mounted on the steering housing (3) and the 
radial extension is a component (9) mounted on the tie rod 

(6). 
A steering arrangement as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterised in that the component (8) mounted on the 

steering housing (3) has a cup-shaped end region surrounding 
each universal joint (5) between the steering rod (7) and a 

tie rod (6), and the periphery of the cup-shaped region has, 
an axial projection (13) at a region positioned above the 

axis of the steering rod (7). 
A steering arrangement as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterised in that the cup-shaped region has axial 

projections (13) both above and below the axis of the 
steering rod (7). 
A steering arrangement as claimed in Claim 5 or Claim 
6, characterised in that the axial projections (13) end in 

domed surfaces. 
A steering arrangement as claimed in any one of Claims 
4 to 7, characterised in that the component (9) mounted on 

the tie rod (6) has a periphery of substantially constant 
axial extent, referred to the axis of the tie rod.
