<DESCRIPTION>
In developing a binding assay, it is important that the 
scientist develop one that has a high level of sensitivity 
and specificity, can eliminate interfering substances, and 
is convenient. The discussion herein may emphasize the 
immunochemical-type assay, but it should be recognized that 
the descriptions are also applicable to gene probe and other 
types of binding assays. Sensitivity means the minimal detectable dose, namely the 
smallest mass of analyte that generates a statistically 
significant change in the signal generated by the assay vs. 
that obtained in the absence of analyte. There is a need to 
increase sensitivity of binding assays (i.e., detect smaller 
amounts of analyte), because in many situations the 
analytes, whether they are hormones, drugs, microorganisms, 
toxins, pollutants or genetic materials, exert their effects 
at low concentrations. Furthermore, high sensitivity allows 
the use of small sample size, which can help to reduce 
"sample matrix" interferences. In addition, higher 
sensitivity allows measuring low analyte concentrations with 
a higher precision. In discussing sensitivity, immunochemists have often 
distinguished between competitive assays and non-competitive  
 
assays. In a competitive assay, the signal which is 
measured is that emanating from the specific binder that 
does not bind analyte. For example, in some competitive 
assays, the labeled antibody is incubated with a sample 
containing analyte and a solid phase-immobilized analyte 
derivative. The labeled antibody that did not bind analyte 
binds the solid phase, and the signal emanating from the 
solid phase-bound labeled antibody is measured. In other 
types of competitive assays, unlabeled antibody is incubated 
with a sample containing an analyte and a labeled analyte 
derivative (or analyte mimic). The labeled analyte 
derivative binds those antibody binding sites that did not 
bind analyte. By measuring the signal coming from the 
labeled analyte derivative that bound the antibody, the 
assayist actually obtains an estimate of the concentration 
of antibody sites that did not bind analyte. Thus, in both 
types of competitive assays, one measures signal associated 
with the fraction of specific binder sites that did not bind 
analyte. The signal generated from a competitive assay 
decreases as the analyte concentration increases. Since 
small levels of analyte correspond to large signals, small 
changes in low concentrations of analyte lead to small 
differences between large numbers, which are
