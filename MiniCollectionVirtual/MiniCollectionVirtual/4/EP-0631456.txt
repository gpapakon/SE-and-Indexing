<ABSTRACT>
A distributed, server-based communications network architecture 
delivers broadband and narrowband communications services. In the architecture, 

various traditional call processing functions, such as switching fabric or channel 
control, call control, and connection control are separated into distinct application 

processes with clearly defined interfaces for communications between these 
application processes. Those distinct application processes may be implemented in 

separate physical or logically partitioned nodes. The well-defined interfaces allow 
communications among: a) physical or logically partitioned nodes within a network 

and b) physical or logically partitioned nodes of other networks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication networks
including a plurality of communications servers, to methods
of delivering broadband and narrowband communication services,
and to methods of delivering communications services in a
broadband and narrowband communications network.Over the years, advances in communications networks architecture have
allowed new telecommunications services to be offered by communications carriers.
For example, the introduction of a separate signaling subnetwork within a
communications network paved the way for to introduction of services, such as
software-defined network and freephone services. Likewise, communications
architectures have changed in response to needs of the marketplace for particular
telecommunications services. For example, persistent requests for customized
services from subscribers were the driving force behind the creation of a service-independent
capabilities-based architecture called "Intelligent Network" (IN)
architecture. The IN architecture represents an evolutionary step from the traditional
communications architecture. More specifically, changes were introduced in the
traditional architecture to meet the requirements of the IN-based services. Of
particular importance in the IN-architecture is the separation of the service control
functions from the transport control functions. However, one of the drawbacks of
the IN architecture is that all network nodes must be capable of, and may be required
to perform, loosely coupled functions aimed at different objectives i.e., there is a
bundling of distinct control functions, such as call control, connection control and
channel control. As a result, introduction of new services associated with one of
these functions require changes to software that effects all of these functions and that
is loaded in these network nodes.With the impending standardization of Broadband Integrated Services
Digital Network (B-ISDN), an emerging class of new services is anticipated to be
offered by carriers and third party vendors. Those services include high bandwidth
multimedia, multipoint applications, interactive video services, bulk data retrieval
and archiving, messaging and distributional services. Associated with these new
services are switching, connection, and signaling requirements whose complexities
are unparalleled in today's communications networks. Requirements that have been 
identified include user/server negotiation requirements, dynamic modification of
active connections, recognition of need for special
