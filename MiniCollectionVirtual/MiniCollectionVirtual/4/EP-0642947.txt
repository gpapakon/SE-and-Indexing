<ABSTRACT>
A contoured vehicle seat back (16a,16b) and a belt 
restraint (28) which cooperate to safely secure and 

immobilise a rearwardly handcuffed prisoner for 
transport. The belt restraint (28) includes a cinching 

handle (32) detachably mounted to the seat belt latching 
mechanism (34) which can be detached from the latching 

mechanism (34) and used to tighten the seat belt (28) 
urging the occupant into engagement with the contoured 

seat back (16a,16b).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a seat belt assembly for
supporting a rearwardly handcuffed prisoner while seated.The transport of prisoners while in the custody of law
enforcement personnel presents numerous risks to the
safety of both the officers and prisoners involved. When
not effectively restrained, prisoners are an obvious
potential risk to the safety of law enforcement
personnel. The officer is particularly at risk when in
close proximity while reaching across the prisoner with
both hands to secure a traditional belt restraint.In recent years, single-piece, hard surfaced rear seats
have been introduced in police and similar vehicles in
an attempt to eliminate some of the deficiencies
encountered in the use of traditional rear seats and
prior art belt restraints. Such assemblies do have
certain advantages over conventional seats, particularly
in connection with ease of cleaning and prevention of
hidden contraband. Such rear seats, however, fail to
minimise an officer's proximity to a prisoner while
engaging in tightening a belt restraint around such a
potentially dangerous individual. US-A-4 576 414 discloses a seat belt assembly comprising:
(a) a belt having a first end portion and a second end
portion, said second end portion being secured to the vehicle
when the seat belt assembly is installed;(b) first and second mating latching means for
selectively engaging each other, said first latching
means being operatively associated with said first end
portion of said belt, said second latching means being
secured when the seat belt assembly is installed, said
first latching means including cinch means for engaging
and tightening said belt; and(c) a handle connected to said first end portion of said
belt, said handle including means for engaging said first
latching means which include a handle engaging portion.
The handle is a latch release member which is operable
to be moved into engagement with a member of said first
latching means to disengage that member from latching
engagement with a cooperating element of the second
latching means.A feature of the present invention provides a seat belt
assembly which can be selectively engaged and tightened
using only one hand.Another feature of the present invention reduces the
exposure of law enforcement personnel to a potentially
dangerous prisoner during the engagement of a seat belt
restraint across the individual.According to this invention there is provided a restraining belt
assembly as defined by claim 1. Preferred features of
a seat belt assembly in which

<CLAIMS>
A seat belt assembly (14) comprising:

(a) a belt (28) having a first end portion and a
second end portion, said second end portion being for securing

to the vehicle when the seat belt assembly (14) is installed;
(b) first and second mating latching means (34 and
42) for selectively engaging each other, said first

latching means (34) being operatively associated with
said first end portion of said belt (28), said second

latching means (42) being secured when the assembly is
installed, said first latching means (34) including cinch

means for engaging and tightening said belt (28); and
(c) a handle connected to said first end portion of
said belt (28), said handle including means (39) for

engaging said first latching means (34), which include
a handle engaging portion (38); characterised in that:

said handle is a cinching handle (32) and said handle
engaging portion (38) is for detachably engaging the

cinching handle (32), the arrangement being such that,
in order to engage and tighten the belt (28) across an

occupant of a respective seat (12) when the seat belt
assembly (14) is installed, the first latching means (34)

with the cinching handle (32) engaged therewith, is
directed across the occupant and engaged with the second

latching means (42), whereupon the cinching handle (32)
is pulled so that it is disengaged from the handle

engaging portion (38) and the belt (28) is tightened.
A restraining belt assembly according to claim 1 wherein
said cinching handle engaging portion (38) projects

outwardly from the person restrained by said seat belt
(28) when said first and second latching means (34 and

42) are engaged.
A restraining belt assembly according to claim 1 or claim
2 wherein said first latching means (34) includes a

latching portion (40) and a cinch portion (36), said
cinch portion (36) being interposed between said latching

portion (40) and said cinching handle engaging portion
(38).
A restraining belt arrangement according to claim 3 wherein
said latching and cinch portions (40 and 36) are

substantially coplanar, said cinching handle engaging
portion (38) being offset therefrom outwardly of the

person.
