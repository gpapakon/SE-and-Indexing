<ABSTRACT>
When a second synchronizing signal, an output from a 
synchronizing signal generating circuit, becomes synchronized 

to an input video signal, switching is made from a 
first synchronizing signal separated from the input video 

signal by a synchronizing signal separation circuit, to the 
second synchronizing signal by the switching action of a 

switch circuit based on a control operation performed by a 
timer circuit. When performing arithmetic operations between 

the current video signal and a delayed video signal in 
the direction of time axis, if variations in the synchronizing 

signal cycle occurs due to variations in the timing 
caused by jitter resulting from noise or waveform distortion, 

the time difference between the two video signals is 
maintained constant at all times, ensuring arithmetic operations 

in the correct time axis direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video signal processing
apparatus according to the pre-characterizing
part of claim 1 and a video signal processing method
according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 12.Apparatus for improving video signal quality include
a video signal processing apparatus of the type that
performs arithmetic operations in the direction of
time axis, for example, a three-dimensional luminance
and chrominance signal separation filter, video signal
noise suppressor, and field or frame interpolation
apparatus. Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a
prior art configuration of such a video signal processing
apparatus, and Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram
showing a video signal in three-dimensional space. In
Fig. 2, the direction of time axis in the video signal
is 
the direction of t axis, which is sometimes called the field
direction or the frame direction. To perform arithmetic
operations in the direction of time axis, it is necessary to
delay the video signal using a storage device such as a
memory circuit; in this case, if the circuit is configured
so that only the effective picture period, excluding the
retrace interval, is stored in the memory circuit, the
required capacity of the memory circuit can be reduced. The
video signal processing apparatus of the prior art shown in
FIG. 1 is an example of such a configuration wherein only
the effective picture period is stored in the memory circuit
and arithmetic operations are performed in the direction of
time axis.In FIG. 1, the numeral 1 indicates an input terminal
via which a video signal is inputted, and 2 designates an
output terminal via which the video signal after arithmetic
operations is outputted. The video signal, input via the
inputted terminal 1, is fed to a synchronizing signal separation
circuit 8, a memory circuit 10, and an arithmetic
circuit 11, respectively. The synchronizing signal separation
circuit 8 separates a synchronizing signal from the
input video signal, and supplies the separated synchronizing
signal to a reset circuit 6. The reset circuit 6 outputs a
reset pulse to a counter circuit 7 in synchronism with the
synchronizing signal. The counter circuit 7 performs a 
counting action upon reception of the reset pulse, and
supplies the count value to a memory control circuit 9. The
memory control circuit 9 controls the memory circuit 10 in
accordance with the count value. The memory circuit 10 is a
storage circuit having the capacity necessary for delaying
the input video signal in the direction of time axis, and
