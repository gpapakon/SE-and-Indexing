<ABSTRACT>
A safety device for racking stores, particularly gallery stores, is equipped with a distributing vehicle (1) movable on a travel way (3) along a rack (2), the distributing vehicle (1) constituting in particular an automatic storage and retrieval unit and serving to store and retrieve storage goods (7) in and from compartments (8, 8') of the rack (2). In order to create a safety device for racking stores which, with little effort, permits safe manual order picking of storage goods (7) from a rack compartment adjoining the travel way (3) of a distributing vehicle (1), it is proposed that the compartments (8, 8') of the racks (2) can be closed in each case with a door (11) on the side facing the travel way (3) and that a drive (10) for opening and closing the doors (11) be arranged on the distributing vehicle (1).

Safety device for shelf stores, in particular gallery 
stores, with a distributor vehicle (1), in particular an 

automatic shelf servicing apparatus, which can travel along 
a shelf unit (2) on a runway (3), for depositing stock (7) 

in compartments (8, 8') of the shelf unit (2) and removing 
it from these compartments,
 
characterised in that the compartments (8, 8') of the 

shelves (2) can each be closed by a gate (11) on the side 
which faces the runway (3), and a drive (10) for opening and 

closing the gates (11) is disposed on the distributor 
vehicle (1). 
Safety device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the gates (11) are guided at the sides 

on guide rails (12), the spacing between them corresponds 
approximately to the width of the compartment (8, 8') and 

they can be raised vertically by the drive (10) from a 
closed position into an open position. 
Safety device according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that the drive (10) is formed as a chain 

drive with guide wheels (14) and chains (17), engaging 
elements (18) are disposed on the chains (17), which 

elements can be inserted in a correspondingly formed stop 
strip (20) to open and close the gate (11), and the stop 

strip (20) is disposed in the region of the bottom end of 
the gate (11). 
Safety device according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that the guide wheels (14) are each 

disposed at the ends of carriers (13), the spacing between 
which corresponds to the width of a compartment (8, 8') and 

which are attached to the distributor vehicle (1) so as to 
extend vertically, and the spacing of the guide wheels (14) 

on a carrier (13) corresponds at least to the distance 
between the closed and the open position of the gate (11).  

 
Safety device according to claim 3 or 4,
 
characterized in that the engaging elements (18) are hook-shaped 

and are connected together at their upward 
projecting, free ends via a rod (19).
