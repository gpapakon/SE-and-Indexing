<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet recording apparatus includes a 
positioning device for positioning a recording head 

(8) on a carriage (2) and an electrically connecting 
device for establishing electrical connection 

between the recording head (8) and a main body 
portion. The positioning device and the 

electrically connecting device are provided on the 
carriage independently of each other. Therefore, 

recording head (8) and an ink tank (9) can be 
certainly and simply installed on the recording 

apparatus. Also, an information processing system 
employs such recording apparatus to output input 

information, such as characters, image or so forth 
on a recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording apparatus according
to the preamble of claim 1 and an information processing
system according to the preamble of claim 2.
Such a recording
apparatus has a mechanism for mounting a head as
means for forming an image on a recording medium by
ejecting an ink. More specifically, the invention
relates to a recording apparatus having a head
installation mechanism which is improved both in
installation of a signal transmitting portion for
transmitting a recording signal to a head and in
installation of the head per se.One of recording systems recently attracting
attentions is an ink-jet recording system. The ink-jet
recording system is a non-impact type recording
system and records input information, such as
characters, images or so forth, by directly adhering
ink (forming dot) on a recording medium (paper,
cloth, plastic sheet and so forth).The recording apparatus having such ink-jet type
recording head (ink-jet recording head) is
attracting attention as the recording system which
satisfies demands for high speed recording, high
resolution, high image quality, low noise and so
forth. The ink-jet type recording apparatus has 
thus been employed as printers for copy machines,
facsimiles, printers, word processors, output
terminals of work stations and so forth, handy or
portable printers to be employed in personal
computers, host computers, optical disk systems,
video systems and so forth.Particularly, in the recent years, in viewpoint
of down-sizing, capability of full-color printing
and effective use of disposable material, there have
been proposed a recording apparatus having a
construction, in which a recording head and an ink
tank storing ink to be supplied to the recording
head are mounted on a carriage.For example, when an ink-jet cartridge, in which
the recording head and the ink tank are integrally
constructed, is installed on the carriage, it becomes
necessary to achieve both of positioning (contact)
of a signal transmitting portion for transmitting a
recording signal to the recording head and accurate
positioning of the ink-jet cartridge per se.One example of installation structure of ink-jet
cartridge on the carriage has been disclosed in
US-A-4,907,018. In the above-identified
US-A 4,907,018 there is disclosed a construction
permitting positioning of the ink-jet cartridge per
se and establishing contact of the signal
transmitting portion, simultaneously in one action,
by utilizing engagement between a pair of the ink-jet
cartridge in the vicinity of the
