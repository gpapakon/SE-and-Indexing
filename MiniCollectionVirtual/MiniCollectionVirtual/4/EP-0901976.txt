<ABSTRACT>
The device has first and second drawing-in rollers (12,14) and uniting rollers (4a-d). These are positioned so that a multi-layered printed material train (2) extends along a line (6), which is mainly tangential to the drawing-in rollers. A folder funnel (36) near the drawing-in rollers has an upper plane (38) extending along the line. The drawing-in rollers have a core of inelastic material, and a jacket of elastic material.

Roller arrangement in a folding machine of a rotary web printing press with a first draw roller (12) having a coating (20) of elastic material and a second draw roller (14) having a coating (26) of elastic material, which together form a roll gap (10), through which a printed material web (2) formed from a plurality of web sheets (2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) directed one above the other by gathering rollers (4a, 4b, 4c, 4d) is directed, wherein the gathering rollers (4a, 4b, 4c, 4d) as well as the first and second draw rollers (12, 14) are arranged in such a way that the multiple-layer web (2) runs along a line (6) arranged substantially tangentially to the first and the second draw rollers (12, 14), 
characterised in that
 the first and the second draw rollers (12, 14) are configured substantially identically.
Roller arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 this additionally comprises a folding cylinder (36), which is arranged close to the first and the second draw rollers (12, 14), wherein the folding cylinder (36) has an upper plane (38) and is arranged in such a way that the upper plane (38) extends substantially along the line (6).
Roller arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the first draw roller (12) is a driven roller.
Roller arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the first and second draw rollers (12, 14) have a core (18, 24) made of non-elastic material and a continuous coating (20, 26) made of elastic material.
Roller arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 of the first and second draw rollers (12, 14) at least one is rotatably mounted in a pair of pivoting (30) arms (28), wherein the pivoting (30) arms (28) are connected to an actuating device (32) for pivoting the arms (28) in such a way that the first draw roller (12) is adjustable to the second draw roller (14).
Roller arrangement according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the adjusting force between the first draw roller (12) and the second draw roller (14) can be controlled by the actuating device (32).
Roller arrangement according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that
 the actuating device comprises a pneumatic cylinder (32).
Roller arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the coating (20) of the first draw roller and the coating (26) of the second draw roller are rubber coatings.
Roller arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the coating (20) of the first draw roller and the coating (26) of the second draw roller are polyurethane coatings.
