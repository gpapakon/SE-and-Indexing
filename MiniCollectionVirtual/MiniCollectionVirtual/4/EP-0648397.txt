<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for maintaining loop stability between a transmit and a receive path of a speaker phone which is capable of operating in either a full-duplex or a half-duplex mode. Loop stability is maintained and normal operation is achieved by controlling transmit and receive path attenuators. The method first determines whether feedforward or feedback signals levels should be used (76). Based on this determination, the signal and noise parameters along various points in the transmit and receive path are evaluated (78, 80). Based on the parameter values (82), the transmit and receive attenuators are adjusted to maintain loop stability and to operate the speaker phone in the proper state (84, 75).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telephone technology and more particularly to
a fail-safe operation method for maintaining loop stability between the
transmit and receive paths of a speaker phone and for switching from a full-duplex
into a half-duplex mode when loop instability is detected.Traditional speaker phones function in a half-duplex mode, allowing
only one person at a time to speak. When one talker (near-end) is speaking in
a half-duplex system, the signals received from the other talker (far-end) are
blocked until the near-end speech is either completed or interrupted by a
stronger signal. Often, while a talker is speaking, the signals may be blocked if
someone at the other end makes moderate noises and activates the
microphone. In other cases, talkers are required to shout into the speaker
phone in order to be heard by the other end. It is generally very difficult, if not
impossible, in a half-duplex system to interrupt current talkers while they are
speaking. All of these conditions are very annoying in a teleconferencing
situation.Room acoustic echo has always been one of the most severe problems in
hands-free speaker phone systems. Acoustic echoes occur when the far-end
speech sent over the telephone line comes out from the near-end loudspeaker, 
feeds back into a nearby microphone, and then travels back to the originating
site. Talkers at the far-end location can hear their own voices coming back
slightly after they have just spoken. One method of eliminating these
irritating acoustic echoes is to apply an echo suppresser to switch off the
microphone while the other end is talking. This results in the half-duplex
operation currently implemented on standard speaker phones. More
sophisticated acoustic echo cancelers are available for full-duplex operation to
improve interactivity in teleconferencing. Acoustic echo cancelers employ
adaptive filtering techniques to model the impulse response of the conference
room in order to reproduce the echoes from the speaker signal. The estimated
echoes are then subtracted from the out-going microphone signals to prevent
these echoes from going back to the far-end. One example of this kind of
echo cancelers is disclosed in US 4,629,829.In accordance with the present invention, a method is disclosed for
maintaining loop stability between the transmit and receive paths of a speaker
phone and for gradually switching from a full-duplex into a half-duplex mode
when loop instability is detected. The fail-safe apparatus consists of
controllable attenuators positioned

<CLAIMS>
A method for maintaining loop stability between a
transmit and a receive path of a speaker phone (10), 
characterized
by
 the steps of:

calculating a first and a second energy ratio for
each of the transmit and receive paths respectively, wherein

the energy ratio is an energy level of a returning echo divided
by a total signal energy level;
determining from the first and second energy ratios
between the use of a feedback and a feedforward signal for the

evaluation of operating parameters;
evaluating a set of operating parameters based on
signal levels from signal path sample points which sample points

differ depending on which of the feedback and feedforward signal
levels is used;
determine an attentuator operating mode based on the
evaluated operating parameters; and
adjusting attenuators (30, 57) located along the
transmit and receive paths based on the determined mode in order

to maintain loop stability.
