<ABSTRACT>
A luggage case having a thermoformed shell is made from a thermoformable preform (11) by pressure laminating a layer of cloth fabric (44) to one face of a thermoplastic substrate (42), preferably as the substrate is extruded and while still hot from an extrusion process. The preform (11) should be of a non-stretch type. This non-stretch characteristic, together with its bonding to the thermoplastic substrate (42), prevents the substrate from thinning in the corner regions. The intimately bonded fabric (44) drags or pulls the substrate (42) from a number of directions as the corner regions are formed and the thermoplastic substrate (42) accumulates and thickens in the corner regions resulting in a shell (12) which is durable and aesthetically pleasing.

<DESCRIPTION>
Over the past 20 years or so, standard hardsided luggage cases included 
two vacuum formed shells of thermoplastic sheet, usually an ABS (acrylonitrile 
butidiene styrene) polymer. These shells were usually fastened to a pair of 
aluminum or magnesium frames. Accessories such as wheels and handles were 
also attached to the frame or directly to the shells. A drawback of such ABS 
shell luggage was that the corner portions, that is the areas of the generally 
rectangular shells at the intersection of the generally planar major face and two 
of the other faces, tended to be relatively thin in comparison to the other 
portions of the thermoformed shell. This is because, inherent to the vacuum 
forming process, the material is stretched thin in these corner regions during the 
deflection of the heated, rubbery ABS sheet into the female vacuum form. 
Consequently, the preform sheet tended to be made of a heavier material in 
order to anticipate this thinning and to compensate for the thinning so that the 
corner regions were adequately constructed. Despite these precautions, the 
vacuum formed shells are subject to failure in the corner regions since a luggage 
case tends to take considerable abuse concentrated at the corners. Also as a result of making luggage of a relatively thicker ABS material, 
the weight of the overall luggage case tended to be high, since the thickness of 
the ABS material in the central portion of the shells were thicker than really 
necessary to provide adequate strength. Also, considerable effort has been expended to provide a scuff resistant 
surface to the outside of the thermoformed shells. A printed capsheet of an 
especially abrasion-resistant material is normally laminated onto the 
thermoplastic ABS substrate.  
 The superior durability and scuff resistance of a fabric covered shell has 
been well known. In an attempt to capitalize on this phenomenon, ABS shell 
luggage has been covered with fabric. One such product, marketed under the 
trademark SILHOUETTE SUPRA by SAMSONITE CORPORATION, the 
assignee of the subject invention, consisted of a conventional thermoformed 
shell, but without the decorative printed capsheet. To this shell was adhesively 
fastened a tailored covering of fabric consisting of a fabric rail portion (sized 
to cover the periphery side walls of the shell), which is in turn sewn to a large 
panel of fabric for covering the major face of the shell. While the aesthetic 
desirability of the resulting fabric covered shell was apparent, this product was

A process of manufacturing a luggage case shell (12, 14), said shell 
having a three dimensional contour, such as a corner region (16), 

comprising the steps of:

   forming the premolded preform (11) in the press while the substrate is in a semi-molten condition to form a 

formed shell preform (110) including the three dimensional contour of the luggage case shell;
