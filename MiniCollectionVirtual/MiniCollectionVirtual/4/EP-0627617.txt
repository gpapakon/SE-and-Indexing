<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and 
device for mechanical testing of an optic fibre. For the 

objective, the fibre is arranged in a number of turns. 
The diameter of the turns is related to the diameter and 

strength characteristics of the fibre. In order to obtain 
a defined bending of the fibre, the bending is realized 

by means of an element containing at least one partly 
circular surface. The stresses to which the fibre is 

exposed mean that the fibre is fractured at a number of 
points during the duration of the test. Occurred fractures 

are registered and assembled in order to calculate 
the fatigue characteristics of the fibre.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a device
according to the preamble of claims 1 and 3, respectively.The optic fibre is made of glass
or some other material allowing the transfer of light.
The fibres are intended for use in telecommunications and
data-transmission. The testing relates to determination
of the susceptibility of a fibre to mechanical fatigue,
which governs the working life of the fibre.The invention is intended for use in conjunction
with type testing of optic fibre, research objectives, in
studies in different environments etc.In testing the ageing characteristics of fibres,
it is previously known to arrange the fibres in different
forms of tensile test. A number of fibres with chosen
loads are arranged in a test pattern. The fibre is
thereafter allowed to remain in the load position until
fracture of the fibre occurs. In order to obtain a
statistical selection, a large number of tests are
arranged, at the same load, in a measuring apparatus. The
arrangement is realized, for example, in a tensile
testing machine or the like. The equipment which is used
in these tests is relatively expensive and/or space-hungry
and remains occupied whilst the measurement series
is conducted. In conducting a measurement series, a large
number of test set-ups have to be arranged.US patent 4 940 891 discloses a system that automatically
measures the strength of optical fibres by initiating
a series of breaks in an optical fibre delivered
from a supply spool. The fibre is stressed to failure in an
automatically displacable jaw mechanism and the fibre is
advanced and the measurement repeated. A computer-controller
advances the fibre, records data and monitors jaw mechanism
fracture parameters so that the strength distribution of a
length of optical fibre is reliably determined.Patent EP 361962 and SU 1357713 show devices in
the form of a cone having spiral-shaped recesses. The
fibre is exposed to a gradually increased deformation,
whereupon detection takes place of the escaped light.There is a need to calculate, in a simple manner,
the working life of a fibre. In order to do this, it is
desirable to present a large number of measurement
results based on a small number of tests. There is
therefore a need to create a large number of fractures of 
the fibre in a single test. It shall herein be possible
to determine the relation of the fracture to the tensile
load to which the fibre is exposed. It is further desirable
to attain significant results, in the static testing
of fibres, from separate test

Method for determining the ageing characteristics of
a fibre, wherein the fibre is bent in a number of turns, the

diameters of which range between a maximum and a minimum
value, and is fixed in this state, 
characterized
 in that the
occurrence of a series of fractures in the fibre, resulting

from static load, is registered in a detecting element, as
well as the time of occurence of the fractures, which registered

information in said detecting element is transferred
to a computing element, which calculates, on the

basis of said information, the stress corrosion coefficient,
n, of the fibre using the following formula:


n = N/ (ln(R) Δk/Δln(ts)),

where

N denotes the number of turns,
R denotes the relationship between the radius of the
maximum and minimum turn,
Δk/Δln(ts) denotes the rate of change of measurement data,
where k denotes the serial number

for a fracture and ts the time of occurrance of the corresponding
fracture, wherein the stress corrosion coefficient,

n, defines the ageing characteristics of the fibre.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized

the diameter of the turns is determined by the diameter and

strength characteristics of the fibre.

partly circular surface, the diameter of which is determined

by the diameter and strength characteristics of a fibre, for
determination of the working life of the fibre, 
characterized
 in that the fibre is fitted to the element, over the at
least partly cir
cular surface, in a number of turns for a
period of time during which a detecting element registers

the occurrence of a series of fractures in the fibre and the
time of occurrence of each fracture, the information on the

number of break-offs and the time of the break-offs being
transferred from said detecting element to a computing element

which calculates the stress corrosion coefficient, n,
of the fibre, using the following formula: 


n = N/ (ln(R) Δk/Δln(ts)),

where

N denotes the number of turns,
R denotes the relationship between the radius of the
maximum and minimum turn,
Δk/Δln(ts) denotes the rate of change of measurement data,
where k denotes the serial number

for a fracture and ts the time of occurrance of the

the element is cylindrical and the fibre, after having been

wound around the element, is either released or, if the
cylinder is made from deformable material, remains seated on

the cylinder, whereafter the different turns of the fibre,
by means of mechanical action, are caused to assume different

diameters, which are defined to a maximum and a minimum
value.
Device according to claims 3-6, 
characterized
 in
that the bending diameter of the fibre around the circular

surface indicates the load to which the fibre is exposed.
