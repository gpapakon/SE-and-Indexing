<ABSTRACT>
A flat cable comprises a series of parallel electrical conductors (1 to 6) each carrying a spiral-wound tape insulation layer (30). The conductors are held together by braiding formed of a plurality of tapes (10 to 22) or fibres interwoven between the conductors. The braiding is preferably of a thermoplastic material which may be heat bonded to the insulation in order to set the cable in a desired shape e.g. for a wiring loom. The insulation and braiding is preferably formed from a mixture of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoro(propylvinylether).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flat cable 
construction comprising a series of parallel 
longitudinally extending electrical conductors arranged 
side-by-side. Flat cables are well known and are used in a variety 
of applications where multiple electrical connections are 
to be made between pieces of electrical equipment. The 
flat orientation of the conductors allows individual 
conductors to be readily identified when connections are 
being made or when end connectors are being attached. 
Conventionally, flat cables are made by extruding the 
insulating material onto the parallel conductors. Conventional extrusion suffers from a number of 
disadvantages, particularly where high performance 
insulation is required, e.g. in the defence industry. 
Firstly, extruded flat cables are very resistant to 
bending in a direction parallel to the plane of the 
cable. This makes it difficult to form conventional flat 
cables into pre-configured wiring harnesses, and means 
that the flat cable must be routed in situ. It would be 
desirable to be able to produce a flat cable construction 
which could be bent in any direction, such as to allow the  
 
production of "drop-in" pre-configured wiring harnesses, 
particularly where it is difficult to route cables in situ 
due to restricted access or space limitations. A second disadvantage is that such extruded 
insulation material does not necessarily give the best 
mechanical and electrical insulation properties. Also in 
order to safeguard the integrity of the insulation, the 
thickness of extruded insulation tends to be greater than, 
for example, that of tape-wound insulation. Insulating 
tapes can be processed, such as by pre-stretching in order 
to provide the desired mechanical and electrical 
properties. It would therefore be desirable to provide a flat 
cable construction which mitigates some or all of these 
disadvantages. US-A-3 582 537 discloses a woven ribbon cable wherein 
a woven lattice structure holds a plurality of insulated 
conductor wires in a given spaced parallel relationship 
and has its warp and weft members bonded to each other at 
the intersections thereof. The weft elements are not bonded to the covering on the conductors, but to additional conductorless warp elements. WO91/17551 discloses an electrical insulating 
composite material comprising an intimate admixture of a 
thermoplastic copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and 
perfluoro (propyl vinyl ether) and coagulated dispersion 
type polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or of porous expanded 
P

A flat cable which comprises a series of parallel 
longitudinally extending electrical conductors (1 - 6) or 

conductor groups arranged side-by-side, each conductor 
having an electrically insulating covering (30), the 

conductors or conductor groups being held together by 
braiding comprising at least one thermoplastic filament 

(10 - 22) interwoven between the conductors or conductor 
groups, characterised in that the braiding is heat-bonded 

to the insulating covering on the conductors. 
A cable according to claim 1 wherein the electrically 
insulating covering is in the form of spirally wound 

overlapping tape. 
A cable according to claim 2 wherein the insulating 
covering comprises a mixture of polytetrafluoroethylene 

(PTFE) and a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and 
perfluoro(propylvinylether) (PPVE). 
A cable according to claim 3 wherein the insulating 
covering comprises porous and non-porous tape formed from 

said mixture. 
A cable according to any preceding claim wherein the 
braiding filament is in the form of a tape.

filament is in the form of a PTFE fiber of substantially 

round cross-section which has been formed from a 
continuous sheet of PTFE which has been helically rolled 

and adhered to itself. 
A cable according to any preceding claim comprising a 
plurality of conductors and a plurality of braiding 

filaments, each filament passing over one conductor or conductor group and 
under an adjacent conductor or conductor group.
