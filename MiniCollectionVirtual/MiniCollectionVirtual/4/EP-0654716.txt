<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is intended to save warm-up 
time of a toner image fixing device for fixing a toner 

image by heating and reduce manufacturing cost of the 
device. Elastically-deformable heat-resistant belt 

(31) is made in form of a cylinder of nickel which 
accommodates therein a heater lamp (32) and a 

reflecting plate (33) for concentrically transferring 
radiant heat from the heater lamp (32) onto a 

contacting portion of the cylinder-like belt with a 
recording paper (28) carrying a toner image (38). When 

the recording paper (28) is transported along a guiding 
plate (50), the driving roller (54) rotates the heat-resistant 

belt (31) in contact with the recording paper 
(28). At this time, the rotating belt (31) and the 

guide plate (50) are pressed against each other, 

thereby the belt (31) is elastically deformed in radial 
direction. The recording paper (28) is transported 

being pressed by the belt (31) and, thereby, the toner 
image (38) is fixed onto the recording paper (28) by 

heat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner image
fixing device according to the preamble of claim 1.In a conventional image-recording device, a
recording medium forms thereon a toner image and
transfer it onto a common paper sheet which is
subjected to fixing the toner image thereon and then is
delivered out of the device. Generally, the toner image
is fixed on a paper sheet by fusing.A fixing device used in the image recording device
comprises a rotatably mounted heating roller made of
aluminum drum coated with fluorocarbon resin (e.g.,
PTFE: polytetrafluoroethylene sold under the trade name
"Teflon") which is free from adhesion of toner, a
pressure roller coated with silicone rubber disposed as
pressed against the heating roller to form
therebetween a contact portion (nip) utilizing elastic
deformation of the pressure roller. While a sheet
carrying a toner image developed with toner thereon
passes through the printing nip, the toner image is
heated and fixed by fusing to the sheet. A heater 
consisting of, e.g., a halogen lamp is mounted in the
heating roller to heat the latter at a specified
temperature necessary for fusing toner of the toner
image on the sheet.In the above-mentioned fixing device, the heating
roller is made of an aluminum drum having wall
thickness of 1.0 mm to several millimeters and outer
diameter of 20 to 60 mm. A toner image developed with
toner on the paper sheet is fixed by fusing while the
sheet passes through a nip (contacting portion) between
the pressure roller and the heating roller heated at a
specified temperature by the heater axially mounted
therein.Another example of a toner image fixing device that
is different from the above-mentioned device is
proposed, wherein a belt being an endless film of 10 to
50 microns in thickness made of heat-resistant material
(e.g., polyamide) envelops therein a heater supporting
member which supports a heater having a resistance on
a ceramic substrate in such a manner that the heater
may be in contact with an internal surface of the
endless belt. A pressure roller disposed in opposite to
the heater and pressed against an external surface of
the endless belt to form a nip portion through which a
paper sheet having a developed toner image passes being
subjected to fixture of the toner image thereon by 
fusing.As described previously, the conventional toner
image fixing device uses the heating roller having a
thick wall of 1.0 to several millimeters in radial
direction, which, therefore, shall be previously heated
by conduction heat to a

<CLAIMS>
A toner image fixing device for fixing a toner image developed on a sheet
or recording paper by heating, comprising:


a rotatable cylinder shaped film (31) made of heat-resistant and heat-conducting
material, which film is elastically deformable in radial direction to form a nip of

width necessary for fixing the toner image (38) on the recording paper (28) and
is disposed around a heater (32);
a paper guiding member (50) abutting on the external surface of the film (31) in
radial direction to form the necessary nip therebetween and to support a reverse

side of the recording paper (28) carrying the toner image (38) developed on its
top side: 
characterized by
 a reflector plate (33) abutting on the inner surface of
the film (31) to reflect radiation heat from the heater (32); and
a driving roller (54) for rotating the film (31) being sandwiched between the
driving roller (54) and the reflector plate (33).
A toner image fixing device as defined in claim 1, wherein the paper
guiding member (50) is a flat plate (50) or a roller (55).
A toner image fixing device as defined in claim 1 or 2, wherein a cylinder
guiding member (34) is disposed between the driving roller (54) and the paper

guiding member (50) along the film to regulate rotation of the film (31).
A toner image fixing device as defined in claim 3, wherein the cylinder
guiding member (34) has a sensor (35) for sensing a surface temperature of the

film (31) to generate a temperature detection signal for controlling an electric
energy to the heater (32). 
A toner image fixing device as defined in claim
1, wherein the reflector plate (33) has a

form suitable to concentrically irradiate the area
where the recording paper (28) contacts with the

film (31).

formed of material for cleaning the external
cylindrical surface of the film (31) or of

material impregnated with silicone oil being well-releasable
from the toner to apply the silicone oil to

the external cylindrical surface of the film
