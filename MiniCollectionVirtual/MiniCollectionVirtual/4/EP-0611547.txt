<ABSTRACT>
The surgical microscope (110) having an illumination device (113) and an illumination beam (118, 122) guided through the main objective (111) of the surgical microscope (110) is provided with a device, arranged in the illumination beam between the illumination source and the object to be illuminated, for protecting the patient's eye in the region of the retina against harmful light effects due to the illumination radiation during the eye operation, this optical device consisting of a light-transparent carrier (16) having a circular filter (17) having a transmission of 60% maximum in the region of the optically visible light from 400-760 nm and a transmission of 10% maximum in the UV region below 400 nm, the filter (17) in the pivoted-in state being in a plane conjugate to the object plane (20) and the circular area being imaged congruently onto the pupil of the patient, or of a filter which has less transmission, for at least in each case one wavelength below 400 nm and a further one above 400 nm in the visible spectral region.
