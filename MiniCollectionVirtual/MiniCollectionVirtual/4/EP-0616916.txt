<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a weatherstrip (20) for 
providing a seal between first and second selectively 

movable window glass panels (18, 16), comprising:
 

   a resilient base portion (22) having means for 
securing the weatherstrip (20) to a first glass panel 

(18); and
 

   a resilient lip portion (24) integral with and 
extending from the base portion (22);

 
   characterised in that the resilient lip (24) 

includes a branched sealing lip portion (42) and a 
longer lip portion (44), with the longer lip portion 

(44) extending in the direction of the base portion 
(22). 
The weatherstrip is effective in preventing water 
leakage and has a refined appearance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to weatherstrips 
for vehicle closures and more particularly to a 
weatherstrip for providing a seal between the front and 
rear windows of the vehicle. Generally, it is intended 
that the weatherstrip of the present invention is to be 
utilized between a front door window and a rear quarter 
window of a 2-door model or between a front door window 
and a rear door window of a 4-door model. In the past, weatherstrips useful for providing a 
sealing arrangement between the window glass panel of a 
vehicle's front door and the rear quarter window glass 
panel or rear door glass panel had a centre sash 
cemented to the front end portion of a rear quarter 
window glass panel. The weatherstrip had a resilient 
strip fitted in the centre sash and included a lip 
portion sealingly engageable with the rear end portion 
of the front door window glass panel. The weatherstrip having a centre sash has the 
following disadvantages. The space between the front 
door window glass panel and the rear quarter window 
glass panel generally becomes large, resulting in a 
deteriorating appearance. The centre sash also needs 
to have a considerable width, which gives rise to a 
defective sealing arrangement between the upper end 
portion of the rear quarter window glass panel and a 
body side weatherstrip mounted on a vehicle body roof 
side portion. This is due primarily to the 
considerable difference in thickness between the part 
having a centre sash and the part which is not provided 
with a centre sash. Furthermore, since the centre sash 
tends to be exposed, the centre sash must be coated to 
give it a more refined appearance. Typically, an 
expensive material such as stainless steel or plated 
sheet steel is utilized for the coating, thus resulting 
in an expensive cost and increasing the overall cost of  
 
the weatherstrip assembly. In an attempt to overcome these problems, 
weatherstrips comprising a resilient L-shaped base 
portion located at one end having a rigid core member 
embedded therein and a resilient lip portion located at 
the other end have been developed. The resilient lip 
portion typically is substantially J-shaped in cross-section 
and forms a sealing point with the front door 
window glass panel. However, with this design, a large 
dimension of seal overlap is required between the 
resilient lip and the glass panel to limit leakage. 
This creates a clearance problem when the glass is in a 
storage position or when the glass panel travels to the 
storage position.

A weatherstrip (20) for providing a seal 
between first and second selectively movable window 

glass panels (18, 16), comprising: 
   a resilient base portion (22) having means for 

securing the weatherstrip (20) to a first glass panel 
(18); and 

   a resilient lip portion (24) integral with and 
extending from the base portion (22); 

   characterised in that the resilient lip (24) 
includes a branched sealing lip portion (42) and a 

longer lip portion (44), with the longer lip portion 
(44) extending in the direction of the base portion 

(22). 
A weatherstrip as claimed in Claim 1, wherein 
the means for securing the weatherstrip to a first 

glass panel (18) includes first and second spaced apart 
legs (28, 30) having incurved end portions (36, 38), 

whereby the incurved end portions (36, 38) tightly 
engage the first glass panel (18). 
A weatherstrip as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the weatherstrip also includes a substantially 

rigid core member (26) at least partially embedded in 
the base portion (22) and having a portion (58) which 

at least partially extends into the resilient lip 
portion (24). 
A weatherstrip as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein the base portion (22) is provided with a recess 

(50) located between an extending nub (40) and an end 
wall (52) of the base portion (22). 
A weatherstrip as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the resilient lip (24) is biased in the 

direction of the second window glass panel (16). 
A weatherstrip as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the longer lip (44) includes a bulbed 

end portion (46). 
A weatherstrip as claimed in Claim 6 when 
appendant to Claim 4, wherein, when the longer lip (44) 

engages the extending nub (40), the bulbed end portion 
(46) of the longer lip (44) engages the recess (50) of 

base portion (22), upon positioning the second glass 
panel (16) against the resilient lip (24). 
A weatherstrip as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the longer lip portion (44) extends from 

the sealing lip (42). 
A weatherstrip as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the base portion (22) and resilient lip 

portion (24) are formed of a rubber. 
A weatherstrip as claimed in Claim 3, or in 
any one of Claims 4 to 9 when appendant to claim 3, 

wherein the core member (26) is formed of a steel.
