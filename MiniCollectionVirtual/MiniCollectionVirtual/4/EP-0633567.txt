<ABSTRACT>
A motor mount arrangement for a capstan drive motor mounted to a tape drive 
bridge (46) in a magnetic tape recorder, the bridge arranged for movement 

toward and 
away from a magnetic tape cassette loaded in the recorder, the motor support 

arrangement configured as a circular aperture (100) through the bridge 
partly defined by an 

arcuate flexible finger portion (96), and diametrically opposed dimples 
(116,118), at least one of which 

is arranged in the flexible finger portion (96). The motor provides 
diametrically opposed 

protrusions (110,112) which interfit into the dimples allowing pivoting 
of the motor about an axis 

defined between the two protrusions. The flexible finger portion (96) 
is displaceable radially 

outwardly from the motor held thereby to remove or install the motor 
into the bridge. 

The flexible finger portion is backed-up by a plastic bushing (106) 
compressed against a 

relatively rigid portion which retains the motor protrusions within the 
recesses and also dampens vibrations to or from the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention
relates to a magnetic tape recorder having a tape drive bridge arranged for
movement toward and away from a magnetic tape cassette loaded in the recorder, the
tape drive bridge carrying the tape drive motor and a magnetic head, the motor having
a drive capstan arranged coaxially thereon and the cassette having a cassette roller
and drive belt arrangement for turning the cassette reels, the cassette roller being in rolling
contact with said capstan when the tape drive bridge is moved toward said magnetic
tape cassette, and said magnetic head engaging the magnetic tape for reading/writing
magnetic signals.It is an important consideration that when the drive capstan rollingly engages
and abuts the cassette roller that the surfaces of the two rollers are not skewed or
tilted toward each other, in other words, that the axis of the drive capstan is parallel to
the axis of the cassette roller, in this case both vertically aligned. Further, the system should be capable for easy mounting and
dismounting of the motor. In known arrangements where the capstan
and cassette roller are brought together for abutting
relationship, the capstan can be inadvertently tilted from the
vertical axis compared to the vertical axis of the cassette
roller, resulting in undesirable wear on the rolling parts, as
well as imprecise performance.In the document EP-A-0 109 154, delimiting the two part form of claim 1, a system is disclosed in which
a capstan drive motor is mounted to a frame. Pins that are
extending from opposite sides of the motor, and that are diametrically
arranged with respect thereto, are rotatably supported
within recesses formed in portions of the frame. However,
the cited document does not
teach how to
mount or to dismount the motor. Additionally, to provide a tension
force of the drive capstan against the cassette roller a
spring element is required.Further, in the document US-A-4 085 906 a support system for a
drive motor within a tape drive is disclosed that provides an
attachment bracket including a cylindrical aperture into which
the drive motor is inserted. The diameters of the cylindrical
aperture and of the motor are dimensioned, such that the motor
can be tilted in order to induce an improved attachment of the
cassette capstan and the drive roller. In order to support the
motor a biasing arrangement is provided that acts on the attachment
bracket. Thus, a quite complicated structure is needed
to support the motor, and, thus, in particular mounting
and dismounting of the motor is
