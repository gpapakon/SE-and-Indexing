<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated structure
current sensing resistor for power MOS devices, particularly
for overload self-protected power MOS devices.Power MOS devices can feature an integrated circuitry
suitable to protect the power device against excessive current
flow, due for example to output load short-circuit.A typical solution provides for a negative feedback loop,
which comprises a current sensing MOSFET, whose drain and gate
are respectively connected to the drain and the gate of the
main power MOSFET, and whose source is connected, through a
current sensing resistor, to the source terminal of the
integrated component. The base-emitter junction of a bipolar
junction transistor (BJT) is connected across said sensing
resistor, while the collector of the BJT is connected to the
common gate of the two MOSFET. A gate resistor is finally
connected in series between an external gate terminal of the
integrated component and said common gate.In practical implementations, both the sensing MOSFET and
the main power MOSFET are made up of similar cells, even if the
latter comprises a much larger number of such cells than the
former.The current flowing through the sensing MOSFET, which is a
small fraction of the current flowing through the main power
MOSFET, generates a voltage drop across the sensing resistor
whose value is chosen in such a way that when the current 
flowing through the power MOSFET exceeds a prescribed maximum
value, the fractional current flowing through the sensing
resistor generates a voltage drop sufficient to turn on the
BJT. This last, by draining current from the gate resistor,
causes the voltage applied to the gate of the two MOSFETs to
decrease, thus preventing the current flowing through them from
further increasing.Furthermore, the positive thermal coefficient of such
feedback loop improves the protecting performances of this
protection circuit, since at higher temperature the maximum
value for the current decreases.In the International Application NO WO 91/09424 a power
device is described which includes in the same substrate as the
power transistor a feedback loop of the type described above.
The sensing resistor is made up of a polysilicon strip obtained
simultaneously with the polysilicon gate layer of the MOS
cells.This solution requires a dedicated area on the surface to
allocate the sensing resistor, which is external to the
sequence of source cells.WO-A-8 908 928 discloses a structure substantially according to the preamble of claim 1.In view of the state
