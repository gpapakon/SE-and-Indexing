<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline. Cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline is
useful as a starting compound for medicines and an additive to
foods. The present invention also relates to a novel enzyme
capable of catalyzing the hydroxylation of L-proline at the 3-position
of L-proline. The novel enzyme is used in the above-mentioned
process.Heretofore, chemosynthetic methods of producing cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline
are known [(J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 84, 3980
(1962); J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 85, 2824 (1963); Nature 289, 310
(1981); J. Org. Chem., 54, 1866 (1989); Acta Chemica
Scandinavica, 43, 290 (1989)].The conventional chemosynthetics methods for
producing cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline are not satisfactory for
industrial production, because of (1) the expensive raw
materials, (2) too many the reaction steps, (3) the
complicated procedures for isolating and purifying the product
and/or (4) the lower productivity of cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline.No chemosynthetic or biological method of producing
cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline by hydroxylating L-proline both
position-selectively and stereo-selectively, had been reported
yet.The object of the present invention is to provide an
advantageous process for the production of cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline,
and the second object of the present invention is to
provide a novel enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of L-proline
at the 3-position and which is useful in the above
process.Tryggvason et al. [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 76, 275, (1977)]
described the separation of the prolyl-3-hydroxylase activity and the
prolyl-4-hydroxylase activity from each other in rat kidney cortex.
The prolyl-3-hydroxylase catalyzed the formation of trans-3-hydroxyproline
moieties in a consensus sequence within collagen.The present invention provides a process for 
producing cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline, which comprises allowing L-proline
to coexist with 2-ketoglutaric acid, a divalent iron
ion and an enzyme source which catalyzes the hydroxylation of
L-proline at the 3-position of L-proline in an aqueous medium
to convert L-proline into cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline, and
recovering the cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline from the aqueous
medium. The present invention further provides a novel
hydroxylase having the following physicochemical properties
(hereinafter referred to as L-proline-3-hydroxylase):
(1) Action and Substrate Specificity:
The enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of L-proline
at the 3-position of L-proline in the presence of 2-ketoglutaric
acid and a divalent iron ion to produce
