<ABSTRACT>
The control cartridge (10) is so small that it can be installed in the mouth (12) of an outlet arm (14). As shut-off elements, it has a control disc (38) fixed to the housing and a control disc (40) which can be rotated by means of an actuating lever (42). The control discs (38, 40), which are preferably composed of ceramic, each have two openings for cold and hot water. Upon rotation, the flow of cold water and the flow of hot water are enabled in succession and the flow of cold water is then throttled. For just one rotary movement of the lever (42), this gives the following states: cold - mixed - hot, and the resulting flow of water remains at least approximately constant from the time when the maximum flow of cold water is reached.

Control cartridge for a single-lever mixer
fitting, having a housing (16, 18) which has connections

for the supply of cold and hot water and in which a
control element and a control disc (40) which butts

against the latter are arranged coaxially with respect
to a central axis (X) of the control cartridge (10), the

control element being fixed to the housing and it being
possible for the control disc (40) to be rotated by

means of an actuating element (42) which can be rotated
around the axis (X), the control element having

exclusively two through-passages (80, 82), of which the
first (80) is connected to the cold-water connection and

the second (82) is connected to the hot-water
connection, and the control disc (40) having at least

one through-passage (84, 86) which opens into a mixing
chamber (78) which is connected to an outlet (77), the

inlet through-passages (80, 82) of the control element
and the through-passage (84, 86) of the control disc

(40) being arranged in such a manner that they are
distributed approximately on a common circle line (88),

such that, on rotation of the control disc (40) in the
opening direction (90), one after the other the cold-water

supply is released up to the maximum extent, then,

in addition, the hot-water supply is released and,
subsequently, the cold-water supply is throttled, it

being the case that the control element is a further
control disc (38) which butts against the abovementioned

control disc (40) and contains the inlet through-passages
(80, 82), the through-flow direction (79) from 

the inlet into the further control disc (38), through
the mixing chamber (78) arranged beneath the control

disc (40), to the outlet (77) runs in an essentially
rectilinear manner in the direction of the axis (X), the

outlet (77) is arrranged on a retaining part (68) which
is introduced in the housing (16, 18) in a manner

secured against rotation, and the mixing chamber (78) is
arranged in a driver bush (54) which is connected in a

rotationally fixed manner, on the one hand, to the
control disc (40) and, on the other hand, via a

connection engaging through the retaining part (68), to
the actuating element (42).
Control cartridge according to Claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the driver bush (54) is connected in a
rotationally fixed manner to a further driver bush (48)

which encloses the outlet (77) and the retaining part
(68), can be rotated around the axis (X) and, for its

part, is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the
actuating element (42), the connection of the two driver

bushes (48, 54) passing through the retaining part (68).
Control cartridge according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the housing, intended for
installation into the mouth region (12) of a discharge

arm (14), comprises two parts (16, 18) which can be
screwed to one another and of which the fitting housing

(16) is intended for arrangement in a cavity of the
discharge arm (14) and a fastening nut (18) is intended

for arrangement, from outside, in an opening (15) of the
discharge arm (14).
Control cartridge according to Claim 3, 
characterized
in that
 the fitting housing (16) has radially
arranged connection stubs (20) for in each case one

cold-water and one hot-water supply line (22).
Control cartridge according to one of Claims 1
to 4, 
characterized in that
 the control discs (38, 40)
consist of a ceramic material.
Control cartridge according to one of Claims 1
to 5, 
characterized in that
 the control disc (40) has
altogether two through-passages (84, 86), of which the 

first (84) corresponds with the cold-water through-passage
(80), and the second (86) corresponds with the

hot-water through-passage (82), of the further control
disc (38).
Control cartridge according to Claim 6, 
characterized
in that
 the two through-passages (80, 82) in the
further control disc (38) are located diametrically

opposite one another.
Control cartridge according to Claim 7, 
characterized
in that
 the through-passages (84, 86) of the
control disc (40) are profiled such that, on rotation in

the opening direction (90), the cold-water through-passage
(84) opening first of all has a decreasing

through-passage cross-section and the subsequently
opening hot-water through-passage (86) has an increasing

through-passage cross-section, in relation to the
through-passages (80, 82) of the further control disc

(38).
Control cartridge according to one of Claims 1
to 8, 
characterized in that
 at least one of the through-passages
(80, 82; 84, 86) in at least one of the control

discs (38, 40) is profiled in the axial direction in
order to achieve continuous throttling.
Control cartridge according to one of Claims 1
to 9, 
characterized in that
 the maximum angle of
rotation of the control disc (40) is at least approximately

100E.
Control cartridge according to one of Claims 1
to 10, 
characterized in that
 the angle of rotation for
the control disc (40) can be set, by delimiting means

(74), to an angle which is smaller than the maximum
angle of rotation.
Mixer fitting with a control cartridge according
to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that
 the
control cartridge (10) is installed such that it is

essentially countersunk in an opening (15), in the mouth
region (12) of a discharge arm (14).
