<ABSTRACT>
A conveyor mat built up of plastic intermediate modules and 
end modules, each module consisting of a plurality of equally 

spaced-apart hinge plates having hinge loops at the two ends 
thereof, the hinge plates of a module being coupled to each other 

by means of a rib (16) asymmetrically located between the hinge loop 
openings which are located opposite each other, the ends of the 

hinge plates on a longitudinal side of a module being located 
between the ends of the hinge plates of a module adjacent in the 

longitudinal direction of the mat, the hinge loops of the two 
modules being coupled to each other by means of a hinge pin 

extending through the hinge loop openings. In operation, when the 
conveyor mat is driven in a first and second, opposite, 

direction, a sprocket wheel meshes with a side face of the rib 
and, respectively, the opposite hinge loop of a module. Through 

these measures, a conveyor mat is obtained whose modules can have 
an extremely slight length, up to 0.5".

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a conveyor comprising a conveyor
mat and at least one sprocket wheel, the conveyor mat being
built up of intermediate modules and end modules, made in one
piece of synthetic material, the width of the intermediate
modules being substantially twice the width of the end
modules, with the modules, viewed in the longitudinal
direction of the mat, being staggered, each module consisting
of a plurality of substantially equally spaced-apart hinge
plates, each extending over substantially the entire length of
the module and each having hinge loops at the two ends
thereof, the hinge plates of a module being coupled to each
other by means of a rib located between the two ends, the ends
of the hinge plates on a longitudinal side of a module being
located between the ends of the hinge plates of a module
adjacent in the longitudinal direction of the mat, the hinge
loops of the two modules being substantially in alignment and
coupled to each other by means of a hinge pin extending
through the openings of the hinge loops, there being provided
means for locking the hinge pin relative to the modules.A conveyor mat, built up of modules for such a conveyor,
is disclosed in EP-A-380201 and is for instance used in the
packaging industry, in bottling plants and the like, wherein
the mat may have a relatively large width, up to some metres,
and is designed as an endless conveyor mat, which at the
beginning and the end of a conveying path is guided over
sprocket wheels arranged across the width of the conveyor. The
modules of which the mats are built up exist in various length
dimensions; for instance, a length of 25.4 mm (1 inch) and of 50.8 mm (2 inches)
is very conventional. For a module having a length of 25.4 mm (1 inch),
it has already been proposed in the above-mentioned European
patent application to drive the module at the connecting rib
of the hinge plates, for which purpose the teeth of the
sprocket wheels are provided with a slot-shaped opening, in
operation meshing with the rib on two sides. For particular 
applications, it is desirable that mats can be used whose modules
have a length which is even slighter than that of the known
modules, for instance a length of 12.7 mm (0.5 inch). Such very short
modules have the advantage that the modules at the end of the
mat, where they are passed around a sprocket wheel, are only
slightly inclined to raise from the plane of the mat due to the
sprocket wheel meshing with the module, the so-called polygon
effect. This polygon effect is

A conveyor comprising a conveyor mat and at least one
sprocket wheel, the conveyor mat being built up of

intermediate modules (10) and end modules (20), each module being made
in one

piece of synthetic material, the width of the intermediate
modules being substantially twice the width of the end

modules, with the modules, viewed in the longitudinal
direction of the mat, being staggered, each module consisting

of a plurality of substantially equally spaced-apart hinge
plates (12; 22), each extending over substantially the entire

length of the module and each having hinge loops (13', 13'';
23', 23'') at the two ends thereof, the hinge plates of a

module being coupled to each other by means of a rib (15; 25)
located between the two ends, the ends of the hinge plates on

a longitudinal side of a module being located between the ends
of the hinge plates of a module adjacent in the longitudinal

direction of the mat, the hinge loops of the two modules being
substantially in alignment and coupled to each other by means

of a hinge pin extending through the openings (14; 24) of the
hinge loops, there being provided means (30) for locking the

hinge pin relative to the modules, characterized in that the
rib (15; 25) of each of the modules is asymmetrically arranged

relative to the openings (14; 24) of the hinge loops (13',
13''; 23', 23'') at the two ends of the hinge plates (12; 22) 

of said module, that between a side face of the rib and the
free end face of a hinge loop of the adjacent module a space

is present for receiving a tooth of said sprocket wheel, such
that in operation the tooth of the sprocket wheel meshes with

the side face (16; 26) of the rib (15; 25) of a module when
the conveyor mat is driven in a first direction and with the

opposite free end face (19; 29) of the hinge loop of the

opposite direction.

viewed in the width direction of the conveyor mat, the outer

hinge plates (18) of an intermediate module (10) are identical
in shape with each other and also identical in shape with a
