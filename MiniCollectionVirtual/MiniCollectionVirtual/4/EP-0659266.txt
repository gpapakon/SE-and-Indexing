<ABSTRACT>
A gyroscope system derives useful power from the earth's stored rotational inertial energy. As the earth rotates, the rotor (52) of the fixed-frame gyroscope (10) precesses, driving a generator (26, 58) installed to react between gyroscope parts that are in mutual relative motion. After each power stroke, with minimal energy input a reprecessing means (46, 140) re-orients the rotor into its initial orientation and it smoothly enters into the next power stroke, producing a positive net energy output.

<DESCRIPTION>
 EARTH/GYRO POWER TRANSDUCERRODGER C. FINVOLDPAUL E. HUMPHREYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe earth stores enough rotational inertial kinetic energy t power the world for about 100,000,000 years at current usage rates Gyroscopes, used only for orientation at present, could be configure to tap this energy similar in principle to the tidal generators tha have operated off the western coast of France.Computations unequivocally demonstrate that energy can b converted directly from the earth's kinetic energy to electrica energy without violating any of the laws of physics, no withstanding misconceptions to the contrary. Such a system migh appear to violate the laws of conservation of energy and momentum but the inarguable facts are, that the energy extracted from th system is balanced by a reduction of the earth's rotational kineti energy (longer earth days) , and, rotational angular momentum losse are balanced by orbital momentum gain. This is accomplished throug the coupling element that is common to both the earth's rotation an the earth's orbital motions, namely: the earth's diameter and orbita incremental radius.The gyrogenerator system of the present invention is similar t tidal generators in that both systems convert kinetic energy o planetary bodies to electricity, with planetary angular momentu adjusting itself accordingly for the conservation of both energy an momentum according to their respective laws. Tidal generator extract energy hydroelectrically from the exceptionally high rise an fall of the sun/moon-driven tides. But whereas conventiona hydroelectric generation transduces power ultimately derived fro solar radiation, tilal transduction taps energy from the lunar orbi and the earth's sun-referenced rotation and lunar orbit, with kineti energy losses from the spheres offsetting energy and power gains.Supporting calculations using accepted physics and gyroscop formulae, detailing energy and momentum exchange among other things can be found in the priority document to this disclosure, U.S. Paten Number filed September 8, 1992 with Serial No. 08/872,51 

for an EARTH/GYRO POWER TRANSDUCER.Another energy conservation-related misconception may hav discouraged development of gyroscopically generated power. When torque is applied to a gyro rotor axis as must be done to extrac power, the rotor spin axis will precess until it is in alignmen with the earth's polar axis, at which point the gyro is in "gimba lock" and no further precession (and thus no more energy production will occur.
