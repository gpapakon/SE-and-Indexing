<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a switch cap (3) which is made of injection-moulding plastic compound or the like and is used as an operating device and resetting element for a push-button switch (1). The switch cap (3) has a base structure (4), a cover (6) which is narrower than the base structure (4) and a flexible, thin-walled membrane (diaphragm) (5) which connects the base structure (4) and the cover (6). A contact surface (8) for bridging over stationary contacts (10', 10'') which are arranged on a supporting part is fitted to the base structure (4), on its surface which faces away from the cover (6). The movement for operation of the switch cap (3) is carried out by the base structure (4) in the direction of the cover (6). The cover (6) and the supporting part are connected to one another in a force-fitting manner by means of a fastening part (11).

Contact element (3) made of a plastic injection material or the like as an 
activating element and resetting element for a push button switch (1) which 

comprises a base (4), a lid (6) narrower than the base (4) and a flexible thin-walled 
membrane (5) connecting the base (4) and the lid (6), whereby the base 

(4) on its surface facing the lid (6) has a contact surface (8) for bridging fixed 
contacts (10', 10") arranged on a support element, preferably a circuit board (9) 

and the stroke movement for activating the contact element (3) by the base (4) 
is performed in the direction of the lid (6), characterised in that the lid (6) and 

the support element are connected together non-positively by means of a 
securing element (11). 
Contact element according to claim 1, characterised in that the contact element 
(3) is designed as a truncated cone, whereby the base (4) has a circular or 

rectangular cross section, the membrane (5) is designed as a conical surface 
and the lid (6) is essentially cylindrical. 
Contact element according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the contact 
element (3) is made of a thermoplastic elastomer. 
Contact element according to claim 3, characteris0ed in that the thermoplastic 
elastomer is a block copolymer which is made of a hard crystalline segment of 

polybutylene- terephthalate and a soft amorphous segment with a long chain 
polyether glycol base. 
Contact element according to one of claims 1 to 4 , characterised in that the 
securing element (11) is arranged on the surface of the lid (6) facing away from 

the base (4), whereby the securing element (11) is designed so that can be 
inserted in a recess (12) of the support element non-positively. 
Contact element according to claim 5, characterised in that the securing 
element (11) is adjusted in cross section to the recess (12).  

 
Contact element according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the securing 
element (11) is arranged centrally on the lid (6). 
Contact element according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in that the securing 
element (11) is designed as a pin (16, 20) with a round cross section. 
Contact element according to claim 8, characterised in that the pin (16, 20) in 
the direction away from the lid (6) is designed to taper conically with a point 

(13, 17). 
Contact element according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in that the recess (12) 
in the support element is designed as a through bore (21). 
Contact element according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in that the securing 
element (11) is designed as a cylindrical shoulder (14). 
Contact element according to claim 11, characterised in that the recess (12) in 

the support element is designed as a blind bore (15). 
Contact element according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the 
securing element (11) is connected in one piece with the lid (6). 
Contact element according to claim 13, characterised in that the securing 
element (11) is made of the same plastic as the contact element (3). 
Contact element according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the 
securing element (11) is designed as a separate part. 
Contact element according to claim 15, characterised in that the securing 
element (11) is designed as a pin (16) with a head (18) whereby the pin (16) is 

inserted into an opening (19) of the lid (6) from the side facing the base (4) so 
that the pin (16) is secured by the head (18) onto the lid (6).  

 
Contact element according to claim 15 or 16, characterised in that the securing 
element (11) is made of hard plastic such as polycarbonate, polyamide, 

polyacetal, polyester, polybutylene-terephthalate or the like or of metal. 
Contact element according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
securing element (11) is made of a lighting means (22) secured to the support 

element which is designed so that it cooperates non-positively with the lid (6) of
