<ABSTRACT>
A front module of a motor vehicle, in particular passenger car, comprises the front axle with the steering system and the passenger compartment with a seat row, and has sockets for the releasable coupling-on of an exchangeable drive module (15), which comprises engine, transmission and rear axle. An exchangeable rear module (28) can be coupled onto the front module (10), which rear module has coupling elements which correspond to the sockets on the front module and cooperate therewith for the purpose of providing a releasable connection.

Motor vehicle, in particular passenger car, with a front 
module (10) which includes the front axle (11) with 

steering (12) and the passenger compartment (13) with a row 
of seats (14) and which has receptacles (21, 22) for 

releasably coupling an exchangeable drive module (15, 15a, 
15b) consisting of drive engine, gearbox and rear axle, 

characterised by an exchangeable rear module (28, 28a, 28b) 
with coupling elements (35, 36) which mate with the 

receptacles (21, 22) on the front module (10) and cooperate 
for the purpose of a releasable connection, and with 

receptacles (45, 46) for releasably coupling the drive 
module (15, 15a, 15b). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 1, wherein the front 
module (10) has a rear door (25) which is pivotable about 

a horizontal axis located at its upper edge (26), 
characterised in that the exchangeable rear module (28, 

28a, 28b) in the roof region comprises a recess (37) 
corresponding to the contours of the front module rear door 

(25) and in that on assembly of front module (10) and rear 
module (28, 28a, 28b) the upwardly pivoted front module 

rear door (25) sealingly closes the recess (37) of the rear 
module, such that it forms part of the roof of the whole 

vehicle (Figs. 4 to 6). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 2, wherein the front 
module rear door (25) slopes down from top front to bottom 

rear, such that, laterally adjoining the rear door (25), 
angled body end sections (27) are formed, characterised in 

that the exchangeable rear module (28) comprises body 
recesses (38) which are correspondingly angled on both 

sides at the front and in which engage the angled lateral 
body end sections (27) of the front module (10) on assembly 

of front and rear modules (Figs. 2, 4 and 5). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 3, characterised in  
 

that on the exchangeable rear module (28) - at the front on 
both sides and on the inside of the angled recesses (38) - 

are arranged connecting panels (39) which on assembly of 
front (10) and rear (28) modules in each case engage behind 

the angled body end sections (27) of the front module (10) 
in each case on the inside, and in that on the connecting 

panels (39) are provided lateral fastening elements (40) 
which cooperate with mating lateral fastening elements (41) 

on the front module (10) (Figs. 2 and 5). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 4, characterised in 
that attached to the front edges of the connecting panels 

(39) facing towards the front module (10) are sealing 
strips (43) which come into abutment with mating seals (44) 

arranged inside the front module (10) in the assembled 
position of front and rear modules (Figs. 2 and 5). 
Motor vehicle according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the exchangeable rear module 

(28, 28a) forms or includes the rear seat region, 
containing a rear row of seats (31), side windows (32) and 

rear window (33) as well as the loading region (34) (boot) 
(Figs. 2, 4 and 5). 
Motor vehicle according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the exchangeable rear module (28, 

28a, 28b) includes a loading space accessible from the rear 
through one or two doors (33, 53), such that the whole 

vehicle composed of front, rear and drive modules (15, 15a, 
15b) forms a minitransporter with only a front row of seats 

(Figs. 5 and 6). 
Motor vehicle according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the rear door (25) of the 

front module (10) is divided into two, such that rear door 
frame (51) and rear door window (52) are in each case 

pivotable independently of each other (Fig. 5).  
 
Motor vehicle according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the (upwardly pivoted) rear door frame (51) also 

serves to connect front (10) and rear (28, 28a, 28b) 
modules, and the rear door window (52) left in the 

downwardly pivoted position forms a partition wall between 
passenger compartment and rear or loading space.
