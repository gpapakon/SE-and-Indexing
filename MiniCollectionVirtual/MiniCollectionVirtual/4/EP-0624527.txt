<ABSTRACT>
A capsule of plastic material for infusion bottles, 
comprising a capsule body (1) to be fitted on a neck of 

a bottle for retaining a pierceable plug (5) in place 
and a capsule cap (10) to be fitted on said capsule 

body (1), wherein said capsule body has a hole (8) 
formed on the top wall (4) thereof and a downwardly 

extending annular ridge (9) formed around and at a 
distance to said hole and said capsule cap (10) 

includes a plug (12) for fitting into said hole (8), 
said plug (12) being provided on its circumference with 

an annular rim (14) designed to be folded outwarly for 
fitting in a space that is defined by the bottle 

closing plug (5) the capsule body wall (4) and the 
annular ridge (9) with respect to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides a capsule of plastic material 
particularly for infusion bottles and the like. The capsule according to the invention comprises a 
capsule body for fitting to a bottle neck to retain a 
rubber plug in place, said capsule body being formed 
with a central hole that is surrounded, at a short 
distace thereto, by an annular ridge formed on the 
lower wall, and a capsule cap provided with a 
cylindrical plug for closing said hole in the capsule 
body, said plug having an annular edge that can be 
folded outwardly so as to fit below said capsule body 
close to said annular ridge in order to retain the cap 
in place. Once the capsule body with its associate cap is fixed 
in place, the lower flat wall of this body will be in 
contact with the closing plug of the bottle thereby to 
prevent air pockets from forming between the capsule 
and the cap and to be helpful in maintaining conditions 
or sterilization.  
 It is known that bottles for containing drugs such as 
infusion liquids or the like are generally closed by a 
pierceable rubber plug which is retained in place by 
means of a capsule of aluminium, this aluminium capsule 
being secured by seaming to the bottle neck to cover 
the entire rubber cap. This capsule has a weakening line formed on its central 
wall for permitting a central portion of the capsule 
wall to be easily removed to give access to the 
underlying rubber plug so that this latter can be 
pierced to draw off a product. Aluminium capsules involve, however, some 
disadvantages. First of all, they cannot be mounted while being 
maintained in a sterilized environment because the 
sheet folding operation that is necessary to fix by 
seaming the capsule to a bottle neck causes a certain 
quantity of aluminium powder to be produced, whose 
dispersion in the environment would destroy the 
sterilized condition. The same as above occurs with lubricant that has to be 
used in machines for manufacturing aluminium capsules. 
As a result, aluminium capsules are mounted in a not 
sterilized environment. Moreover, it frequently occurs that an user will get 
cut or will hurt himself in pulling up this material. 
It would then be desirable that a different material 
i.e. a material which does not involve the above-described  
 
described problems could be resorted to and such, as a 
plastic material, for example. Several efforts have been made to this end but none of 
them was brought to a successful result. Plastic material, in effect, either does not withstand 
such high

<CLAIMS>
A capsule of plastic material for infusion bottles, of the type 
comprising a capsule body (1) to be fitted on a neck of the bottle 

for retaining a pierceable plug (5) in place and a capsule cap 
(10) to be fitted on said capsule body (1), said capsule body 

having a hole (8) formed on its top wall (4) whereby said capsule 
cap (10) includes a plug (12) for fitting into said hole (8), said 

plug (12) being provided on its circumference with an annular rim 
(14) designed to be folded outwardly characterized in that 


the underside of the top wall of the capsule body is provided 
with a downwardly extending annular ridge (9) formed around and at 

a distance to said hole, 
the outwardly folded rim (14) fits into the space that is 
defined by the bottle closing plug (5), the top wall (4) of the capsule body 

and the annular ridge (9). 
The capsule of plastic material according to claim 
(1), wherein the thickness of said annular rim (14) is 

substantially the same as the height of said annular 
ridge (9) such that after said annular rim (14) has 

been folded this rim (14) will be in alignment with 
both the lower wall (13) of plug (12) and the bottom 

edge of annular ridge (9). 
The capsule of plastic material according to any 
preceding claim wherein said capsule body has an 

internal annular ridge (6) formed on a lower edge 
thereof for engaging with a corresponding ridge on an 

edge of a bottle, said annular ridge (6) being in the  
 

form of a number of ridge portions spaced by a distance 
(7) from one another. 
The capsule of plastic material according to any 
preceding claim wherein the capsule is provided with a 

grip ring (11) secured to said closing cap (10). 
The capsule of plastic material according to any 
preceding claim wherein both said closing cap (10) and 

said closing ring (11) are fixed by heat-sealing to 
said capsule body. 
The capsule of plastic material according to any 
preceding claim, characterized in that the height of 

said plug (12) of capsule cap (10) is equal to the 
thickness of wall (4) of the capsule body plus the 

height of annular ridge (9), such that when the cap 
(10) has been fitted on the capsule body (1) the lower 

wall (13) of plug (12) and the bottom edge of annular 
rim (9) are on a same plane to rest against the closing 

plug (5). 
The capsule of plastic material according to any 
preceding claim, wherein a guarantee seal is provided 

and consists of a strip means fixedly connected to the 
capsule body through a plurality of bridges which are 

ruptured as a result of tampering attempt.
