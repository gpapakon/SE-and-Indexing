<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a female closure profile (10) for a reclosable closure for film bags and the like. Setting out from a female closure profile known from the prior art and having a substantially rectangular cross-section, according to the invention cutouts are provided on the outside of the profile in the region of the base thereof, adjoining shoulders serving as stop elements, which cutouts lead to savings of material and to lower thermal loading of the regions of the film material adjoining the profile.

<CLAIMS>
Female closure profile (10) which is adapted to lock with 
a complementary male closure profile of a reclosable 

closure serving to close film bags and the like, the 
closure elements of the closure being formed by extrusion 

at opposite walls of the bag, with a groove defined by 
attachment arms (14) provided, in particular, with catch 

hooks (16) for receiving the male closure profile, with a 
base (12) joining the attachment arms, with a relatively 

thin stem (13) via which the base is joined to the 
adjacent wall of the film bag or the like, and with two 

shoulders (18) which are provided on the base as stop 
elements for delimiting pivotal movements of the female 

closure profile relative to the adjacent wall so that the 
outer sides of the attachment arms, the base and the 

shoulders approximately define a rectangle, 
characterized 
in that
 a groove-shaped recess (24, 26) is provided 
adjacent to each of the two longitudinal sides of each of 

the shoulders (18) on the female closure profile (10). 
Female closure profile as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that the inner wall surface (30) of the 

groove is of concavely rounded configuration in the 
region of the shoulders (18).  

 
Female closure profile as defined in claim 2, 
characterized in that the inner wall surface (30) of the 

groove is of approximately circular arc-shaped cross 
section.
