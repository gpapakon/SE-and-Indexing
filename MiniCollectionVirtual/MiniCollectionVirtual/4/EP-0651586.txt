<ABSTRACT>
Of special application in cellular networks based on the GSM standard 
for carrying out the supervision, maintenance and control of fixed cellular 

terminals. 
This procedure is applied to a cellular network based on a fixed part 
(MSC, BSC, BS, OMC, SC) and a mobile part which comprises cellular 

terminals (TCF, TCM) that communicate with the preceding fixed part of the 
network and in which this cellular network has a short message service 

channel for transmitting information between terminals of the mobile part 
and a service centre (SC). 
The aforementioned GSM short message service channel is used to 
transmit messages for supervision, maintenance and control between the 

fixed cellular terminals (TCF) and the maintenance and control centre 
(OMC).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a procedure and the means for performing the 
functions of supervision, maintenance and control, in a remote manner, of 
fixed cellular terminals used in cellular networks based on the GSM 
standard. Likewise, it is also the object of this invention to perform the 
aforementioned functions for public terminals connected to these fixed 
cellular terminals. The need to perform functions of supervision, maintenance and 
control in communications networks is a requirement, on the operators' part, 
in the section of the infrastructure of the network that is their responsibility, 
for guaranteeing the correct operation of the services they offer, as well as 
for rapidly repairing any anomaly that might arise. To this end, there are 
various more or less adequate alternatives, depending on the type of 
network and its configuration. Recently a multitude of new services and configurations are being 
proposed for networks defined and standardised in the course of the last few 
years, such as, for example, GSM. This GSM network also provides a series of teleservices (short 
messages, facsimile, etc.), data transmission and suplementary services 
(message forwarding and call restriction). Thus, for example, the short 
message teleservice permits the sending of individualised messages of 
limited size for and from the mobile terminals, in point to point mode, as is 
indicated in the recommendation of the GSM 03.40, version 3.5.0 of February 
1992 under the title "Technical realization of the short message service point-to-point". 
This service makes use of a service centre that acts as a short 
message store and forward centre. Based on standards of this kind, the network operators can cover 
determined types of basic service which, in another way, would be more 
expensive or difficult to offer. For example, this is the case of the so-called 
"fixed cellular network" based on GSM type cellular networks, in which one  
 
of the mobile terminals is located in a fixed position and also is deprived of 
the mobility functions in order to reduce complexity. To this terminal, now 
commonly termed "fixed cellular terminal", through corresponding line 
interfaces specially designed for the purpose, are connected telephone 
terminals or similar equipments in the same manner as a fixed service 
subscriber line. In this type of infrastructure, as already stated, it is usually the 
operator's responsibility to carry out the network maintenance that includes 
the fixed cellular terminal which, for
