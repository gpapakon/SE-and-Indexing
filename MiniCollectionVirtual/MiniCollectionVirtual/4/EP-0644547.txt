<ABSTRACT>
An integrated multichip memory module structure and method of 
fabrication wherein stacked semiconductor memory chips are 

integrated by a controlling logic chip such that a more 
powerful memory architecture is defined with the appearance of 

a single, higher level memory chip. A memory subunit is 
formed having N memory chips with each memory chip of the 

subunit having M memory devices. The controlling logic chip 
coordinates external communication with the N memory chips 

such that a single memory chip architecture with N × M memory 
devices appears at the module's I/O pins. A preformed 

electrical interface layer is employed at one end of the 
memory subunit to electrically interconnect the controlling 

logic chip with the memory chips comprising the subunit. The 
controlling logic chip has smaller dimensions than the 

dimensions of the memory chips comprising the subunit. A lead 
frame, having an inner opening extending therethrough, is 

secured to the electrical interface layer and the controlling 
logic chip is secured to the electrical interface layer so as 

to reside within the lead frame, thereby producing a dense 
multichip integrated circuit package. Corresponding 

fabrication techniques include an approach for facilitating 
metallization patterning on the side surface of the memory 

subunit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in one aspect to high density 
electronic packaging which permits optimization of device 
performance within a given volume. In another aspect the 
invention relates to an integrated multichip memory module 
structure and method of fabrication wherein stacked 
semiconductor memory chips are integrated by controlling logic 
such that a more powerful memory architecture having the 
functions of a single, higher level memory chip is presented 
to external circuitry. Conventionally, integrated circuit devices, such as memory 
devices, have been made from wafers of semiconductor material 
which include a plurality of integrated circuits. After a 
wafer is made, the circuits are separated from each other by 
dicing the wafer into small chips. Thereafter, the chips are 
bonded to carriers of various types, electrically 
interconnected by wires to leads and packaged. By way of improvement, high density electronic packaging 
modules having multiple semiconductor chips have become 
popular. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,525,921 and 
4,646,128 by Carson et al. disclose structure and fabrication 
techniques for producing one type of high density electronic 
processing package. Each of these patents describes a 
semiconductor chip stack consisting of multiple integrated 
circuit chips adhesively secured together. A metallized 
pattern is provided on one of the side surfaces of the stack 
for electrical connection of the stack to external circuitry.  This metallization pattern typically includes both individual 
contacts and bused contacts. The stack is positioned on an 
upper surface of a substrate such that electrical contact is 
made between the stack metallization pattern and a substrate 
surface metallization pattern. Traditionally, computer memory systems are assembled from many 
types of memory chips, such as, DRAMs, SRAMs, EPROMs and 
EEPROMs. The number of storage devices per memory chip 
technology generation varies but increases over time with more 
devices per chip being delivered with each succeeding 
generation, thereby providing greater memory capacity. When a 
next generation memory chip becomes available, the number of 
chips needed to make a given memory system is correspondingly 
reduced. With fewer memory chips needed, the resultant memory 
system becomes physically smaller. Next generation DRAM memory chips have traditionally increased 
by 4× the number of bits compared with current generation 
technology. For example, assume that the current generation 
of memory
