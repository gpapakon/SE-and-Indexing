<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic composition, a
thermistor element and a process for producing a ceramic body.As materials for thermistors which may be employed at
higher temperatures, there have so far been employed (a) a
material composed mainly of compounds of a corundum type
crystal structure, as disclosed for example in JP Patent
KOKAI Publication No. 50-118294 (JP-A-118294/75) or "Fine
Ceramics Handbook" by Kenya HAMANO, published by ASAKURA
SHOTEN in 1984, (b) a material composed mainly of compounds
of a spinel type crystal structure, as disclosed for example
in JP Patent KOKAI Publication No. 49-63995 (JP-A-63995/74),
(c) a material composed mainly of ZrO2, as disclosed in
"Internal Combustion Engine" vol. 30, number 8, page 98, and
(d) a material mainly composed of compounds of a perovskite
type crystal structure. In JP-A-5 009 057 a perovskite
structured complex oxide for electrodes is disclosed, said
oxide containing rare earth metal e.g. lanthanum, alkaline
earth metal e.g. calcium, and transition metal e.g. aluminium.However, with the material (a) composed mainly of the
corundum type crystal structure, it is not possible to
adjust its resistance-temperature characteristics to a
greater extent, although such characteristics can be changed
slightly by addition of other elements. On the other hand,
the material ceases to have a stable corundum structure and
is deteriorated in thermal stability on addition of an
additive in a larger quantity.The material (b) composed mainly of compounds having the 
spinel type crystal structure has a higher rate of change of
temperature-resistance characteristics, that is a
temperature gradient constant β , such that it cannot be
used over a wider temperature range. On the other hand, a
material composed mainly of NiAl2O4, as disclosed in JP
Patent KOKAI Publication No. 49-29493 (1974) (JP-A-29493/74)
or a material composed mainly of CoAl2O4, as disclosed in JP
Patent KOKAI Publication No. 48-705 (JP-A-705/73), is low in
thermal resistance and cannot be used at elevated
temperatures.The material (c) composed mainly of zirconia has its
resistance increased for a temperature range lower than its
activation temperature and cannot be practically employed.With the material (d) composed mainly of compounds
having the perovskite type crystal structure, if only a
small quantity of oxides of La is left unreacted, such
unreacted component is reacted with the moisture in
atmosphere to yield labile La(OH)3 leading to destruction of
the element or to unstable
