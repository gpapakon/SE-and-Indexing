<ABSTRACT>
The device supplies a circuit (1) comprising a section at ambient pressure, such as a tray (2) for freezing food, pharmaceutical or veterinary products. It comprises   a) a first tank (4) which is for recovering the liquid and is fitted with means (43,61,71,81) for pressurising the liquid collected, b) a second tank (5) which is constantly pressurised and operates to supply the circuit (1) with pressurised cryogenic liquid, this second tank being in selective fluid communication (16) with the first tank, and c) means (12) which are sensitive to a predetermined relationship between the levels of filling of the two tanks, for selectively activating the pressurisation means (43,61,71,81) of the first tank (4) so as to transfer cryogenic liquid contained in the first tank into the second tank (5).
