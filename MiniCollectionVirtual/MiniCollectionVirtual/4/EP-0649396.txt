<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for converting unsaturated 
hydrocarbons to aromatic compounds. Ethylbenzene is an important commercial solvent and a precursor to styrene. 
Styrene is a major commercial chemical which finds its principal use in the manufacture of 
polymers such as polystyrene. Typically, styrene is formed by the dehydrogenation of 
ethylbenzene. Both ethylbenzene and styrene may be produced by catalytic 
dehydrocyclization of 4-vinylcyclohexene ("VCH") by use of various known catalysts. Two-step 
processes for producing styrene and ethylbenzene are also known wherein butadiene is 
dimerized to form VCH and the VCH is then catalytically aromatized. However, the prior art lacks methods of producing styrene and ethylbenzene 
directly from butadiene. Methods for the aromatization of VCH, moreover, have been plagued 
with poor yields and large amounts of by-products such as xylene with are extremely difficult to 
separate from the styrene and ethylbenzene. What is needed are new, more selective and effective processes for the 
production of aromatics such as ethylbenzene and styrene which alleviate problems in the prior 
art. What is also needed is a process to produce aromatics directly from butadiene thereby 
offering a new method of producing the aromatics in one step. This invention, in one respect, is a process for the production of aromatic 
compounds from butadiene which comprises contacting a feedstream comprising butadiene 
with a catalyst under conditions effective to convert a least a portion of the butadiene to 
ethylbenzene or styrene or both, wherein the catalyst is 
an oxide of molybdenum and a Group IA alkali metal promoter on a support 
selected from the group consisting of silica, alumina, or a magnesium-alumina 
composite, or  an oxide of molybdenum, an oxide of magnesium, and a Group IA alkali metal 
promoter,   
and wherein the oxide of molybdenum in the catalyst has an oxidation state less than or equal 
to + 6 and greater than + 4. A process for the preparation of aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g cymene) 
from possibly substituted butadiene (e.g. isoprene) in presence of 
zirconium or magnesium oxides catalyst is described in Chemical 
Abstracts, vol 112, 157828e. It has been found that butadiene can be converted to ethylbenzene or styrene or 
both by catalytic aromatization in the presence of certain molybdenum containing catalysts. A first catalyst useful in the present invention is described in U.S. Patent No. 
4,973,791. Generally, the catalyst may be described
