<ABSTRACT>
Carbon particulate concentration of diesel exhaust or other sampled gas is measured by collecting the particulate on a high efficiency filter (18) while measuring the amount of sampled gas passing through the filter (18). The filtered particulate is then heated in an oxygen rich environment (16) to oxidize carbon within the particulate to carbon dioxide. The amount of resulting carbon dioxide is measured with a closed measurement loop (30) to derive a corresponding measurement of the amount of filtered particulate. Particulate concentration is calculated by comparing the amount of carbon particulate with the measured amount of sampled gas passed through the filter. Filtered particulate can be heated incrementally to obtain a measurement of volatile carbon components within the particulate prior to the oxidation of the non-volatile carbon component. The filter (18) employed to collect the carbon particulate is of a high temperature resistant type making it reusable and can be either integral with or inserted into the oxidation chamber (16) of the instrument. Oxidation of the particulate inherently concurrently cleans the filter (18) for reuse. An upstream preseparator (15) can extend the life of the high efficiency filter (18). Particulate can also be collected for analysis by using an accelerating impaction nozzle (68) in conjunction with a heatable impaction plate (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
measurement of carbon particulates, and more 
particularly to a method and apparatus for 
determining the level or concentration of 
carbon particulate of a sampled gas, e.g. diesel exhaust. The quality of air has become an important 
environmental concern within recent years. In an 
effort to curb air pollution and maintain air 
quality, strict vehicle exhaust emission guidelines 
have been set by federal and state authorities. 
Requirements for diesel emissions are extremely 
stringent because of the harmful effects of diesel 
exhausts within the atmosphere. Therefore, each 
diesel vehicle sold, for example within the United 
States, must pass certain emission tests and meet 
strict environmental emission standards. To 
determine if emission standards have been met, it is 
necessary to measure the particulate concentration of 
diesel exhaust. In order to accurately determine 
whether a diesel engine  
 
meets emission standards, a reliable reading of the 
particulate concentration of diesel exhaust is 
necessary. An inaccurate reading of diesel 
particulate concentration could result in a diesel 
engine improperly passing or failing emission tests. 
It is, therefore, desirable to utilize a technique 
for accurately and reliably measuring the particulate 
concentration of diesel exhaust. Presently, diesel particulate is measured using 
a few different types of systems. One particular 
technique involves a direct measurement of the mass 
of particulate within exhaust on a real-time basis. 
With this technique a tapered element oscillating 
microbalance such as that shown in U.S. Patent 
4,391,338 is capable of measuring the mass of 
particulate deposited on a filter. This technique is 
not inexpensive and generally requires a dilution 
tunnel for proper use. Another technique for 
measuring the amount of particulate concentration of 
diesel exhaust involves optical measurements. This 
technique, however, suffers from a lack of accuracy 
and does not provide consistently reliable 
measurements of particulate mass. Another technique 
for measuring the particulate concentration of diesel 
exhaust involves forcing a measured amount of exhaust 
through a filter which collects the particulate 
therein, and then weighing the filter. The filter is 
preconditioned and preweighed so that the difference 
in weight of the filter before and after its use is 
representative of the amount of particulate within 
the exhaust. The disadvantage with this particular 
system is
