<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an underground construction 
which does not need to have pillars standing 
on the ground. The underground construction having 
no pillars is made by digging directly into the ground 
from ground level. This underground construction 
can be equipped with air-conditioning facilities. Noises 
can be intercepted, in the underground construction, 
at a floor interval. A water tank can be disposed 
at a bottom of a cone shape space. The underground 
construction can be used a underground parking lot 
or a greenhouse. The underground construction can 
provide a underground space that is completely isolated 
from the ground surface. A floor construction 
body of the underground construction can hung by 
suspending means. Afloor construction body is supported by several 
pillars standing on the ground in current buildings. 
Conventional underground constructions include a 
roof, a bed, and floor portions. Accordingly, when the 
number of floors increases , the weight that each pillar 
supports increases. The pillars have to support 
tremendously big loads in buildings having many 
floors. When a building is planned or designed, a calculation 
about thickness or strength of the pillars becomes 
tremendous and very complicated. In the case 
of the buildings having underground floors, they are 
similar to the buildings built on the ground from the 
structural strength view point. Weight of all floors 
must be supported by pillars standing on the underground 
supporting basis. The underground supporting 
basis is considered as a standard or reference level 
for each pillar. Parking lots for cars are handled as normal buildings 
too except a simple parking lots. Therefore, 
buildings for parking lots having three floors or more 
are planned or designed in the very same way as for 
normal buildings. Astrength calculation for each pillar 
and beam is generally similar to ones for normal buildings. 
A parking lot established underground is built on 
the same structural theory as for a parking lot built on 
the surface. Thus, the weight of all floors is supported 
by pillars standing on the underground supporting basis 
. When the number of floors become large, the ratio 
that pillars occupy in an elevation plan area of the 
buildings increases. The effective area of the buildings decreases because 
of the pillars. Construction of buildings having 
no pillars has been demanded. Further, the energy that the building needs in air-conditioning 
becomes a social problem too. Abuilding
