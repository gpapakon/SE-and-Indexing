<ABSTRACT>
Device for supplying a power supply voltage to an electronic circuit, the said device comprising a current transformer having a primary circuit (10) and a secondary circuit (11), a rectifier bridge (12) at the terminals of the secondary circuit, and, at the output terminals (P, Q) of the rectifier bridge, a first capacitor (C1) in parallel with a first resistor (R1) at the terminals of which the said power supply voltage (U) is picked off, a first switch (I1) being arranged between the output terminals (P, Q) of the rectifier bridge, characterised in that, between the output terminals (P, Q) of the rectifier bridge, it comprises a branch comprising, in series, a second capacitor (C2), a second switch (I2) and a second resistor (R2), the first switch (I1) being controlled by a first threshold detector (DS2) at the terminals of the second capacitor (C2), the second switch (I2) being controlled by a second threshold detector (DS1) at the terminals of the first capacitor (C1).

Device for supplying a power supply voltage to an
electronic circuit, in particular to an electronic circuit (3)

associated with a current sensor for measuring the electrical
current in a high-tension line, said device comprising a

current transformer having a primary circuit (10) and a
secondary circuit (11), a rectifier bridge (12) shunting the

secondary circuit and output terminals (P, Q) of the rectifier
bridge, a first capacitor (C1) in parallel with a first

resistor (R1) across which said power supply voltage (U) is

obtained, a first switch (I1) being disposed between the
output terminals (P, Q) of the rectifier bridge, characterised

in that it comprises between the output terminals (P, Q) of
the rectifier bridge a branch comprising in series a second

capacitor (C2), a second switch (I2) and a second resistor
(R2), the first switch (I1) being controlled by a first

threshold detector (DS2) shunting the second capacitor (C2),
the second switch (I2) being controlled by a second threshold

detector (DS1) shunting the first capacitor (C1), the first
and second threshold detectors (DS1, DS2) respectively closing

the first and second switches (I1, I2) when predetermined
first and second thresholds (sl, s2) are respectively reached.
Device according to claim 1 characterised in that
the current transformer comprises two secondary windings

(11A, 11B) having different numbers of turns and connected in
series to the rectifier bridge connected to the rectifier

bridge (12) through a controlled third switch (I3).
Device according to claim 2 characterised in that
the third switch (I3) is controlled by a third sensor (DS3)

receiving the current flowing through the secondary winding
(11A, 11B).
Device according to claim 2 characterised in that
the third switch (I3) is controlled by said first threshold

detector (DS2).
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that it comprises, shunting the rectifier

bridge output, a branch including in series a third capacitor
(C4) in series with a fourth switch (I4), said capacitor being

connected to a power supply line (L4) receiving electrical
energy from the output of an opto-electronic converter (CS)

receiving at its input luminous energy conveyed from the
ground by an optical fibre F, said fourth switch (I4) being

controlled by said third detector (DS3).
Device according to claim 5 characterised in that
the luminous energy in the optical fibre (F) is sent in the

form of pulses also used to generate synchronisation
instructions sent to said electronic circuit (3).
