<ABSTRACT>
An interactive user support system for a document processing 
system or an image producing device controls the operation of the 

machine using an internally stored knowledge base derived from 
information and rules provided by experts in the field. A plurality of 

sensors monitor the operation of the machine and a variety of user actions. 
If the system determines that the user needs help, by comparing the 

operation of the machine with the information and rules in the knowledge 
base, the system will interrupt the user and offer or provide assistance. If 

the user is performing proper steps to correct a problem or perform a 

specific job, the system will not interrupt the user. Additionally, the user 
may query the system for assistance or direction. The result is a more 

efficient document processing system or image producing device for use in 
any environment and able to be operated by a variety of users having a 

range of needs and abilities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to machines and machine control
using Artificial Intelligence (Al), and in particular to document processing
and image producing machines, such as, for example, reproduction
machines, fax machines and printers for producing copies of images, or
images based upon electronic data streams, having an on-board expert
system for tailoring operation of the document processing or image
producing machine to closely match a user's needs and abilities.Artificial Intelligence (Al) is a branch of science resulting from the
marriage of the cognitive and computer sciences. Computers, originally
used for the manipulation of numbers (data), are now being used for the
manipulation of ideas (knowledge). Trends and solutions can be inferred
by the assimilation of observed or sensed facts just as numbers are added
and subtracted to produce totals. Computer systems have been developed
that exhibit functions very similar to some of the thought processes
previously ascribed only to humans.The study of Al leads to insight regarding the human thought
processes in addition to the development of practical systems to solve
problems in the workplace, the school and the home. The "expert system"
is one utilization of Al technology for obtaining practical results. An
expert system solves problems through the manipulation of knowledge.
The expert system is an inference engine with a knowledge base upon
which it operates. The knowledge base is compiled from both information
about the target system and the experience of human experts in the field
which is encoded in a computer language suited for the description and
manipulation of ideas and principles.The inference engine has, in recent years, become a widely available
product through a number of companies, including Gold Hill Computers,
Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts; Intellicorp, of Mountain View,
California; Technology Applications, Inc., of Jacksonville, Florida;
Teknowledge, Inc., of Palo Alto, California; Neuron Data, Inc., of Palo Alto,
California; and Texas Instruments, of Austin, Texas. Two inference engines
have been disclosed in U.S.-A- 4,658,370 to Erman et al., and
US-A-4,648,044 to Hardy et al., both assigned to Teknowledge, Inc. Expert systems recently have found use in a variety of applications,
such as in agriculture, chemistry, computer design, construction,
engineering, finance, management, health care, manufacturing, and
others. For example, in U.S-A-4,591,983 to Bennett et al., an expert system
for use in inventory control is

An interactive user support system for an image producing device, including

storage means for storing information and rules relating to operation of the image producing
device;
sensing means (S
1
,S
2
..S
N
) for sensing the operation of the image producing device as a
result of user actions,
user interface means (26,26') for enabling an interactive dialogue between said system and said
user:

CHARACTERIZED BY :

comparing means for providing signals representative of a deviation between
user expectations inferred from said user actions, and the sensed operation of the image producing device and for comparing the operation performed by said user on said image

producing device based on said signals representative of a deviation from said sensing means with said information and rules stored in
said storage means;
means for determining whether it is appropriate to communicate with said user in
accordance with the comparison result from said comparing means; and
controlling means (24) for controlling output of the user interface (26,26') means only if said determining
means determines that it is appropriate to communicate with said user.
An interactive user support system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said sensing
means comprises a plurality of sensors (S
1
,S
2
, .. S
N
) disposed at specific locations in the image
producing device.
An interactive user support system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said
controlling means prevents operation of the image producing device if said comparing means determines

a difference between a series of actions performed by said user and said information and rules
stored in said storage means.
An interactive user support system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein said user interface means (26) communicates with said user via a display screen.
An interactive user support system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein said controlling means provides assistance to the user via said user interface means if said

comparing means detects a difference between a series of actions performed by said user and said
information and rules stored in said storage means.
An interactive user support system as claimed in claim 5, wherein said user
interface means comprises means for initiating an interactive dialogue with said user. 
A method of operating an image producing device using an interactive user
support system, the method including


storing information and rules relating to operation of the image producing device;
sensing the operation of the image producing device as a result of user actions;
enabling, with a user interface, an interactive dialogue between said system and said user;

CHARACTERIZED BY :

providing signals representative of a deviation
between user expectations inferred from said user actions, and the operation of the image producing device, by comparing said user expectations with the output of said sensing step
comparing the operation performed by said user on said image producing device based on
said signals from said providing step with said information and rules;
