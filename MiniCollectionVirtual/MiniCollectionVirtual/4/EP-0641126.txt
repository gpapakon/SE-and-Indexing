<ABSTRACT>
In a television broadcasting signal of a wide 
screen having compatibility with a conventional receiver 

presently used, a multiplex signal of each of top and 
bottom panels can be transmitted without generating 

degradation of an S/N ratio at the time of regeneration, 
and without causing an erroneous operation such as synch 

separation when the broadcasting signal is received by 
the receiver. In a transmission side, the multiplex 

signal multiplexed to the top and bottom panels is 
modulated by an AM-modulator (312), a component close to 

a carrier of the AM-modulated signal is extracted by a 
BPF (313), and an amplitude thereof is detected, the 

amplitude of the component is limited by a non-linear 
circuit (314), a high frequency component thereof is 

removed through an LPF (316), and used as an amplitude 
adaptive signal, the amplitude adaptive signal is 

subtracted from the AM modulation signal by a subtracter 
(31), and multiplexed and transmitted to the top and 

bottom panels. In a receiving side, a component whose 
low frequency component of the AM modulation signal 

transmitted to each of the top and bottom panels is 
removed is extracted through a BPF (322), and an amplitude 

thereof is detected, the amplitude is limited by a 
non-linear circuit (324), a high frequency component of 

the output is removed through an LPF (325), and used as 
an amplitude adaptive signal, and added to the AM 

modulation signal, thereby regenerating an original 
multiplex signal of each of the top and bottom panels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
adding an additional signal to a television broadcasting 
signal and transmit/receiving the signal, and 
more particularly to an apparatus for controlling a 
transmission level of the additional signal and 
transmitting/receiving the additional signal. A television signal of a wide screen whose aspect 
ratio is 16:9 (hereinafter called as long widthwise 
image signal) cannot be displayed as it is by a broadcasting 
receiver having an aspect ratio of 4:3, which is 
presently used. There are several methods for providing 
compatibility in the long widthwise image signal so as 
to allow the long widthwise image signal to be displayed 
by the receiver presently used. There is known a letter box system for transmitting 
a long widthwise image having an aspect ratio of 16:9 
and 360 scanning lines [lines/frame] at the central portion 
(main panel) of a screen having an aspect ratio of 
4:3 and 480 active scanning lines 480 [lines/frame] 
defined by the present NTSC system. In this case, since 
only image data using only a 3/4 of the active scanning 
lines defined by an original NTSC system can be 
transmitted to the main panel, vertical resolution is 
inevitably deteriorated to 3/4. On the other hand, in 
the television signal of the letter box system, there  
 
are areas each having 60 scanning lines [lines/frame], 
serving as non-imaging portions, at upper and lower non-image 
portions (top and bottom panels) of the screen. There has been proposed a system for multiplexing 
an additional signal for compensating for deterioration 
of the image of the main panel by use of the top and 
bottom panels. According to this system, the additional signals 
are multiplexed into 120 scanning lines of the encoded 
top and bottom panels. The multiplexed signals are 
compensation signals having a vertical high frequency 
component and horizontal low frequency component. The 
compensation signals are compressed in a direction of 
time, and multiplexed. The compensation signals have 
components, which are visually prominent on the screen 
in view of energy. The additional signals to be 
multiplexed in the non-imaging areas are regarded as 
merely noise to the conventional receiver presently used 
since the additional signals are not utilized in the 
conventional receiver presently used. Therefore, there 
is a possibility that the additional signal will be prominent 
as interference to the conventional receiver. If a transmission level of the multiplex signal is 
lowered,
