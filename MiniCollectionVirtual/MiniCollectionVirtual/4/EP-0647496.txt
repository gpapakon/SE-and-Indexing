<ABSTRACT>
Stud (81) for detachably connecting a component (82, 83), provided with through-holes or the like, to a further component, such as a table, likewise provided with through-holes, the through-holes being circular or slot-shaped in cross-section and having cylindrical or parallel walls. The stud (81) is provided with an axially running threaded spindle (95) which is connected in a rotationally locked manner to a handle (84) or the like led out to the outside. This handle is provided as an outer clamping means, while the threaded spindle (95) is provided at its other end with a stem (97) or the like which acts on catch means (balls 91) which can be pushed out of the stud (81) in the radial direction.

<CLAIMS>
Bolt (81) for joining one component (82, 83) through which holes etc.
have been drilled to a second component such as a table through which

holes have also been drilled with the possibility of subsequent re-separation
of the two components, where the drilled holes have a circular

or oblong cross-section and have cylindrical or parallel walls, where the
bolt (81) is provided with a bolt housing (86), an axially threaded spindle

(95), which turns with a handle (84) located outside the bolt that is
provided externally to facilitate tightening, where the threaded spindle

(95) is provided on one end with a cylindrical section (97) that engages
locking devices (91) and where the locking devices (91) are pressed

radially out of the bolt (81) when the threaded spindle (95) is screwed into
the bolt housing (86) and than the locking devices (91) will be holt in this

position by the cylindrical section (97), where the bolt housing (86) is
provided with a groove (87) all round its circumference, into which a

rubber ring (88) or similar part is fitted, which rubber ring (88) brings a
brake moment between the bolt housing (86) an the drilled hole when the

handle (84) will be turned, where balls (91) are provided as locking
devices and are housed in recesses (89) bored radially in the bolt housing

(86), the radial recesses (89) provided to accommodate the balls (91) are
upset (90) at least in places on the outside of the housing. 
Bolt according to claim 1, wherein the cylindrical section (97) has a
conical extension (98) at the end of it that is facing away from the handle

(84), which presses the balls (91) outwards when the threaded spindle is
screwed into the bolt housing (86).
Bolt according to claim 2, wherein a pin (99) with a smaller cross-section
is provided at the end of the conical section (98), against which the

locking balls (91) rest when no pressure is being applied to them.
Bolt according to one of the previous claims, wherein a hole (92) is
drilled in the bolt housing (86) to accommodate the threaded spindle (95).
Bolt according to one of the previous claims, wherein the end of the bolt
housing (86) into which the threaded spindle (95) is to be inserted is

provided with an annular projection (94) that can be crimped.
Bolt according to one of the previous claims, wherein the handle (84) is
cylindrical in shape and has a larger diameter than the bolt housing (86).
Bolt according to claim 6, wherein the circumference of the cylindrical
handle (84) has a knurled surface.
Bolt according to one of the previous claims, wherein the handle (84) is
provided with a centrally positioned opening (100), into which a tool such

as a hexagon key can be inserted for turning purposes.
