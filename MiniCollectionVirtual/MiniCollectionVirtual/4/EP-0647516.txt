<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flow restrictor for adjusting the mass pressure in screw extruders. This is intended to solve the problem of eliminating dead spaces downstream of the flow-restricting point by means of a simple sturdy flow restrictor in the form of a ram. This is achieved by the invention in that a cylindrical ram (3) is displaceably arranged symmetrically in a rectangular melt channel (2) such that a constant material flow on both sides is ensured, there being arranged in the entry region (x) of the ram (3) at least one through-bore (31) running in the flow direction.

Device for the setting of the mass pressure for the preparation of 
synthetic materials in a screw extruder (1) by means of a cylindrical 

plunger (3), which is displaceable into the melt channel (2) 
transversely to the melt flow at the exit of the screw extruder (1) and 

which is arranged to be so displaceable symmetrically in the melt 
channel (2) that a constant material flow at both sides is assured, 

characterised thereby, that the melt channel (2) is rectangular and at 
least one passage bore (31) extending in the direction of flow is 

arranged in the entering region (X) of the plunger (3). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
plunger (3) is constructed to be steplessly adjustable radially from 

outside hydraulically or by way of a setting motor, wherein the passage 
bores (31) are arranged to be so distributed in the entering region (X) 

that an increasing freeing of the cross-sectional area of the passage 
bores (31) for the melt flow takes place with increasing throttling of 

the free cross-sectional area of the melt channel (2). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the plunger (3) is used as running-up throttle in a twin-screw 

extruder (1).
