<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a rollerway with a plurality of conveying rollers (2) which are rotatably arranged one behind the other in the longitudinal direction of the rollerway and can be driven by a circulating belt (13). The driving strand of the belt (13) extends in the longitudinal direction of the rollerway and is guided to run round a rounded supporting element (15), while bearing on the circumferential surface of the rollers (20), at certain places in each case between two mutually adjacent rollers (20), for the purpose of increasing the angle of wrap, the supporting element (15) being designed as a freely rotatable roller (20).

A roller conveyor having a plurality of transport rollers 
(2) which are arranged rotatably one behind another in the 

longitudinal direction of the roller conveyor and may be driven 
by a revolving belt (13) whereof the drive side (14) extends in 

the longitudinal direction of the roller conveyor and, when 
bearing against the outer surface of the transport rollers (2), 

in certain positions, in each case between two mutually adjacent 
transport rollers (2), is guided such that it runs round a 

supporting element (15) constructed as a freely rotatable roller 
(20), for the purpose of increasing the angle of contact,
 
characterized in that the freely rotatable rollers (20) are 

mounted in one or more U-shaped bearing strips (21), arranged one 
after another, there being made in the free ends of the 

perpendicular U-limb (22) of each bearing strip (21) recesses 
(23), which are open at the edge, for receiving the ends of the 

rotational spindle (24), each bearing strip (21) being mounted 
in a U-shaped support rail (17) extending horizontally in the 

longitudinal direction of the roller conveyor, and the upper side 
(14) of the belt (13) runs above the support rail (17) and the 

lower side (18) runs within the support rail (17). 
A roller conveyor according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that the freely rotatable rollers (20) are 

constructed from plastics material, in particular as a plastics 
injection-moulded part, and have a rotational spindle (24) of 

metal which is inserted with force fit. 
A roller conveyor according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that a plurality of recesses (23) are 

constructed one behind another in the longitudinal direction of 
the bearing strip (21). 
A roller conveyor according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
  
 

characterized in that the bearing strips (21) comprise 
prefabricated lengths having terminating walls (25) constructed 

at each end. 
A roller conveyor according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that the bearing strips (21) are constructed in 

the region of the U-limbs (22) as an open U-shaped profile (26), 
the open sides of the U-shaped profile (26) being directed 

towards one another, and the recesses (23) being constructed in 
each case in the upper U-limb (27) of the U-shaped profile (26). 
A roller conveyor according to Claim 5,
 
characterized in that the bearing strips (21) lie with the lower 

U-limb (28), opposite the upper U-limb (27), on the free ends of 
the vertical U-limbs (29) of the support rail (17). 
A roller conveyor according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
 
characterized in that there is arranged in the U-shaped profile 

(26) in each case a strip-shaped bearing insert (30), in 
particular of plastics material, in which there are provided 

bearing recesses for the rotational spindle (24), which are 
adapted to the recesses (23). 
A roller conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 7,
 
characterized in that the U-limbs (29) of the support rail (17) 

are bent off inwardly towards one another at an acute angle, so 
that there is produced a narrowing of the cross-section of the 

U-shaped profile (26) of the support rail (17). 
A roller conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 8,
 
characterized in that, by means of U-shaped holding clips (32) 

reaching round the support rail (17) from below, screw bolts (33) 
are used to secure the support rail (17) vertically adjustably 

to transverse supports (31) of the roller-conveyor frame, the 
support rail (17) being overlapped at its upper side by a holding 

strip (34) which is connected in each case to the screw bolts 
(33) in screwed connection.  

 
A roller conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 9,
 
characterized in that the support rail (17) is closed at each end 

by an end cap (39), the end cap (39) being detachably secured 
within the support rail (17). 
A roller conveyor according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
 
characterized in that the roller-conveyor frame (6) has four 

supporting feet (7) which are connected diagonally to 
longitudinally adjustable tension rods (8).
