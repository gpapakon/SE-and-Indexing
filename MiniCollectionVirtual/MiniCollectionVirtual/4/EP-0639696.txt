<ABSTRACT>
The lubricant supplying pump pumps a finite amount of lubricant during a 
single pumping stroke and a drive unit, preferrably a stepper motor, operates 

the pump through incremental phases of movement each less than the complete 
pump stroke. The lubricant requirements of the engine are determined and the 

driving increments are adjusted to as to provide a pumping stroke when the 
liquid comsumption of the machine which is the output of the pump. Various 

arrangements for stepper motors and controller arrangements therefore are 
disclosed for controlling the amount and timing of the liquid delivery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for supplying lubricant to a
machine, in particular a lubricating system for an internal
combustion engine, comprising a lubricant supply unit having a
lubricant pump and to a method of supplying lubricant to a
machine, in particular of lubricating an internal combustion
engine, comprising a lubricant pump.Various types of lubricating systems
have been proposed including both closed systems in which the
lubricant is recirculated and so-called open systems wherein
the lubricant is supplied to the mechanism and dissipated to
the atmosphere during the mechanism operation. Although the
latter type of system has the advantage of simplicity, the
discharge of lubricant to the atmosphere can cause obvious
problems.Under the machines involved internal combustion
engines are a specific example of
mechanisms which require lubrication. Generally four-cycle
engines are lubricated by closed systems while two-cycle
engines, because of their very nature, are lubricated by open
systems. Although it was previously the practice to
lubricate a two-cycle engine by mixing lubricant with the
fuel which it consumed, these lubrication methods are not at
all satisfactory because they provide the same amount of
lubricant under widely varying running conditions while the
actual engine requirements are different. In addition, they
tend to provide excess lubricant so that the most severe
conditions will be met and thus there is a large amount of
lubricant consumed and discharged to the atmosphere.Systems have been proposed for providing direct delivery
of lubricant to the engine and the measuring of the amount of
lubricant required and supplying only that amount of
lubricant required for a given running condition.
Conventionally these systems have employed lubricant pumps
that are driven by the engine with the amount of lubricant
varied by either changing the delivery intervals for the 
lubricant or by changing the amount of lubricant pumped by
the pump during each cycle. Although these systems offer
more accurate control of the amount of lubricant than when it
is mixed with the fuel, they still have some disadvantages.For example, if the delivery interval is changed in
order to control the amount of lubricant delivered to the
engine, the effect of internal leakage within the pump itself
cannot be ignored. That is, the amount of lubricant actually
pumped is not that which is the theoretical capacity of the
pump. For example, with a piston-type pump, the piston
displaces a certain volume of fluid
