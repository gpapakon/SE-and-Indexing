<ABSTRACT>
Single wheel drive unit with a drive motor (1), the stator frame (3) of which, closed by front face end plates (4, 5), is designed as wheel carrier for the single wheel (2) to be driven and the rotor shaft (8) of which is supported in the end plates (4, 5) by means of high-speed roller bearings (6, 7), the rotor shaft (8) being axially externally drive-connected to the single wheel (2) by way of a planetary gear train (12-14). That end of the drive motor (1) on the gear side has a stator frame extension (15) extending in an axial direction, which is fixed by its outer axial end at a first point in the chassis (16, 17); the stator frame (3) is fixed by its inner axial end at a second point in the chassis (16, 17). In a drive motor of this type the stator frame (3) is subject to significantly less loading in its function as wheel carrier.

Single-wheel drive unit, which comprises the 
following features: 


a) a drive motor (1), the stator housing (3) of which 
is constructed as a wheel support for the single 

wheel (2) to be driven, 
b) the stator housing (3) is sealed by end shields 
(4, 5) arranged on the front side, 
c) in both end shields (4, 5) the rotor shaft (8) of 
the drive motor (1) is mounted by way of high-speed 

rolling bearings (6, 7), 
d) the rotor shaft (8) is in synchronized connection 
with the single wheel (2) axially on the outside 

by way of a planetary gearing (12-14), 
e) the gear-side end of the drive motor (1) has a 
stator-housing extension (15) extending in the 

axial direction, 
f) the stator housing (3) is supported in the chassis 
with its axially inner end and the stator-housing 

extension (15) is supported in the chassis with 
its axially outer end, 
characterized in that
g) only the stator housing (3) is constructed as a 
support for the single wheel (2) and its wheel hub 

(9), 
h) the stator housing (3) with its axially inner end 
and the stator-housing extension (15) with its 

axially outer end are each fastened in a bearing-free 
manner and rigidly to the chassis (16, 17), 

and 
i) the housing (19) of the planetary gearing (12-14) 
is frictionally connected to the axially outer end 

of the circumferential wheel hub (9), with 
j) the ring gear (14) of the planetary gearing being 
fastened to the gear housing (19) in a 

rotationally secure manner. 
Single-wheel drive unit according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the stator-housing extension (15) 

is constructed as a planetary support, on the arms (18) 
of which the planetary wheels (13) of the planetary 

gearing are mounted. 
Single-wheel drive unit according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the gear-side end shield (4) is 

also constructed as a planetary support, on the arms 
(18) of which the planetary wheels (13) of the 

planetary gearing are mounted.
