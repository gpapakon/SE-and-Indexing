<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hot melt jet ink 
compositions. More specifically, this invention is directed 
to hot melt jet ink compositions having improved, adherence 
and abrasion resistance characteristics. Typically, ink jet printing involves forming 
characters on a substrate by ejecting ink droplets from a 
printhead having one or more nozzles. In order to provide a 
high quality image; hot melt jet ink compositions which are 
solid at room temperature, but molten at jetting temperature 
are used. Unfortunately, such hot-melt jet ink 
compositions, while capable of providing a high quality 
image, are readily abraded or deformed upon handling of the 
printed substrate. Such abrasion and lack of adherence is a 
problem not only when printing onto porous substrates, such 
as paper, but is particularly troublesome when applying hot-melt 
jet ink compositions to nonporous substrates, such as 
plastic films and coated or noncoated containers.  European Published Application No. 0 475 707 
discloses hot melt jet ink compositions containing polyester 
resins having acid numbers in the range from 1 to 54 and 
proposes the use of resins having an acid number of 10 or 
more in combination with mono-and dialkylbenzene-sulfonamides. 
Such sulfonamides, however, are often 
incompatible with other hot melt jet ink ingredients. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to 
provide hot melt jet inks that overcome the above-mentioned 
disadvantages of the prior art. Another object of the invention is to provide an 
improved ink for hot melt jet ink printers that produces 
print with a sharp image of high resolution which is 
resistant to abrasion. These and other objects of the present invention 
are attained by providing a hot melt jet ink comprising a 
coloring agent and a tall oil rosin having an acid number of 
at least 55. Preferably, the total acid number for ink 
composition is at least 49. As used herein the term "tall 
oil rosin" includes natural tall oil and wood rosins as well 
as modified tall oil and wood rosins and tall oil and wood 
rosin derivatives. A process for making such a hot melt ink 
composition comprises the steps of melting a mixture 
comprising at least one rheology modifier, adding a tall oil 
rosin having an acid number of at least 55 to the mixture, 
maintaining the mixture comprising the tall oil rosin in a 
molten state, and adding a coloring agent.  The ink compositions of the present invention have 
the property of improved adhesion to a substrate and exhibit 
low shrinkage on
