<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is provided for selectively shearing 
angle iron and flat stock. The apparatus has a frame 

defining a receiving station (50) for separately receiving 
angle iron or flat stock. The receiving station includes a 

stationary shear blade assembly (61-64) having two 
shearing edges (65, 67) extending from a vertex to define 

a generally 90° angle inside corner. A first arm (26) is 
pivotally mounted to the frame about a first pivot axis 

(30). A second arm (84) is pivotally mounted to the first 
arm (26) for pivoting movement about a second pivot axis. 

The second arm includes a movable shear blade assembly 
(81, 82) having two shearing edges (86, 88) directed 

outwardly to define a generally 90° angle outside corner. 
An actuator is mounted on the frame for pivoting the first 

arm (26) about the first pivot axis (30) between open and 
closed positions. The second arm (84) defines a guide way 

(128), and the frame has a guide member (132) which is 
selectively positionable relative to the first axis for 

slidably engaging the guide way to pivot the second arm 
(84) about the second pivot axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a machine having a 
blade on a pivotally mounted arm for shearing metal 
workpieces, including flat bar or plate. Machine shops, structural steel plants, 
manufacturing facilities, and the like may employ 
machines for shearing metal workpieces, such as steel 
stock of various shapes and sizes. One type of machine, 
commonly known as an "ironworker" or "universal 
steelworker", performs four or five different metal 
working processes on workpieces at four or five separate 
stations. Typically there is a punching station for 
punching holes or other shapes, a notching station for 
notching the edge of a workpiece, a bar stock shearing 
station for shearing lengths of round or square bars, an 
angle iron section shearing station for cutting angle 
iron, and a flat stock shearing station for cutting flat 
bar or plate. An example of such an ironworker design is 
described in the U.S. Patent No. 3,866,522. The 
ironworker machine employs a single, large arm or beam 
12 which is pivotally mounted to the frame and which is 
operated with a hydraulic piston and cylinder actuator. 
The various stations, such as a punching station 52, a 
flat stock shearing station 48, an angle cutting station 
74, and a notching station 54, are defined at various 
locations along the length of the pivotally mounted 
beam. Such an ironworker design provides the advantages 
of simple operation and low cost.  Although the conventional pivoting beam 
ironworker machines function generally satisfactorily, 
there are some disadvantages associated with such 
machines. In particular, because the pivoting beam 
necessarily swings the shearing blade or blades through 
an arc as the workpiece is sheared, the blades and/or 
dies wear more quickly. Further, as the blade swings 
through an arc while cutting flat stock, there is a 
change in the angle of the blade cutting edge relative 
to the flat stock. Thus, the material is not cut at a 
constant, optimal angle. In view of this problem, it 
would be desirable to provide a system for adjusting the 
angle of the moving shear blade to accommodate various 
flat stock materials and to accommodate workpieces of 
various sizes. Preferably, such a system should easily 
accommodate relatively rapid adjustment. In addition to cutting flat stock, a shear 
machine should desirably have the capability for cutting 
angle iron. In order to cut angle iron with a single, 
moving blade, both legs of the angle iron must be cut by 
the blade substantially simultaneously and

An apparatus for shearing a workpiece (52, 54) 
wherein said apparatus comprises: 

   a frame (22, 24) defining a receiving station (50)

(30) and which includes a movable shear blade assembly 
(81, 82) defining at least one shearing edge (86, 88); 

   an actuator mounted on said frame for pivoting said 
arm assembly about said first pivot axis between an open 

position in which said movable and stationary shear blade 
assemblies are spaced apart and a closed position in which

characterized in that 

   said arm assembly includes a second arm (84) mounted 
to said first arm (26) for pivoting movement about a 

second pivot axis, said movable shear blade assembly (81, 
82) being carried by said second arm; and 

   said second arm defines a guide way (128) and said 
frame has a guide member (132) selectively positionable
