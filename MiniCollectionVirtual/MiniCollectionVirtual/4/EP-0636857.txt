<ABSTRACT>
A detector includes a matrix sensor (20) having a transmission 
line group (22) and a reception line group (26), and a 

signal processing system (170) for detecting the existence and 

position of a metallic body by driving the matrix sensor. The 
signal processing system scans to send a signal current to the 

transmission lines and receives a signal from reception lines, 
and it detects the existence and position of a metallic body on 

the basis of the reception signal. When a line or lines for which 
scanning is not made are designated in advance for either one, 

or a part, of the reception line group and the transmission line 
group, the signal processor skips scanning of the line or lines, 

for which scanning is not made, when such line or lines are designated 
in advance, on the basis of such an instruction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a metal substance detection system 
for detecting the presence position of a metal substance and in 
particular to a metal substance detection system for sensing the 
presence or absence of a metal substance and if it exists, sensing 
the presence position thereof by using a matrix sensor which 
comprises a matrix of sensing regions provided by a plurality of 
transmission lines and a plurality of reception lines. It may become necessary to detect the presence position of a 
metal substance in a determined area, particularly in a plane area, 
for example, to detect a move path of a metal substance moving in 
a plane area or when metal substances distribute in one area, to 
detect their distribution pattern. A specific example of the former 
is to detect a move path of game play media in a gaming machine. With some gaming machines, a player moves a metal 
substance, such as a metal ball, in a specific space set 
in the gaming machine and may or may not win the play  
 
depending on the destination of the metal ball. Pinball machines 
are typical of such gaming machines; with a pinball machine, a 
player plays a game by dropping a metal ball called a "pinball" in 
a space sandwiched between parallel planes in which a large 
number of obstacles are located. A general pinball machine has a base board for providing a 
space required to move pinballs, a glass plate spaced from the 
base board at a given interval to cover the base board, and a 
propelling mechanism for propelling pinballs in the space 
provided by the base board and the glass plate. The pinball 
machine is set up so that the base board becomes substantially 
parallel to the vertical direction. The base board is formed with a 
plurality of safe holes for the player to enter a pinball in for a 
winning game play through which the pinball is discharged from 
the base board and an out hole into which pinballs not entered in 
the safe holes are finally collected for discharging the pinballs 
from the base board. A large number of pins (nails) are set up substantially 
vertical to the base board in a state in which they project from the 
base board as long as the diameter of a pinball as obstacles with 
which pinballs dropping along the base board frequently collide 
for causing their motion direction to fluctuate. The pins are 
located on the base board as a distribution determined so as to 
guide pinballs colliding with the pins toward or away from the 
safe holes while causing the motion directions of the pinballs to 
flu
