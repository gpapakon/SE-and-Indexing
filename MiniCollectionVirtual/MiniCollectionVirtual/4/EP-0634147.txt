<ABSTRACT>
A dental handpiece contains a holding and securing 
member (5, 14, 22) for detachably accommodating a dental 

treatment tool (3) therein, an opening (4) for accommodating 
the dental treatment tool (3) in the holding and securing 

member (5, 14, 22), and a dust prevention member (30, 32, 34, 
36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41) secured to the dental treatment tool 

(3). The dust prevention member overlies the vicinity of the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dental handpiece and more particularly to a dental
treatment tool having a dust prevention member for preventing foreign matters,
such as tooth debris from being intruded into bearing portions within the
handpiece.The dental handpiece having a dust prevention mechanism is disclosed in
Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model Application No. 4-88922 (1992). Such dental
handpiece has a chuck member for holding a dental treatment tool, a bur sleeve
for holding the chuck member, and a rotatable partitioning member rotated in
unison with the bur sleeve. There is formed a gap in the outer periphery of the
rotatable partitioning member communicationing at one end with the bearing
portions and at the other end with an opening in the bur sleeve. There is also
formed a discharge port communicating with the gap for discharging the foreign
matter, such as tooth debris.Although a certain favourable effect in dust prevention may be expected of the
above-described dust prevention device, it suffers above all from a complicated
mechanism which leads to considerable cost and labor-consuming maintenance
operation. Another dental handpiece having a dust prevention member is disclosed in the
US-patent 3,762,052. This document, which forms the basis for the preamble of claim 1,
describes a circular flange as a dust
prevention member secured to a sleeve, which is integral with the handpiece
head. Although this device may prevent dust and dirt from penetrating into the
opening of the handpiece head it has disadvantages concerning the hygienic
properties. As the dust prevention member cannot be separated from the
handpiece head it has to be cleaned toghether with the head. However, because of
the devices additionally attached to the handpiece head sterilization of the dust
prevention member is greatly limited.It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a dental handpiece which is simple in construction
and superior in hygienic properties by having a dust
prevention member on the dental treatment tool on the outer
side of the handpiece for preventing the foreign matter from
being intruded into the interior of the handpiece.The above and other objects of the present invention
will become apparent from the following description.According to the present invention, there is
provided a dental handpiece comprising holding and securing
means for detachably accommodating a dental treatment tool
therein, an opening for accommodating the dental treatment
tool in the holding and securing means, and a
