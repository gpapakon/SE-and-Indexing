<ABSTRACT>
A method of and a device for speech signal digital 
coding are described, where spectral parameters are 

quantized at each frame in order to exploit the actual 
correlation inside a frame or between contiguous frames. The 

quantization devices (DQ) recognize strongly correlated 
signal periods by using a first set of indexes (j₁), 

representing the parameters and provided by the spectral 
analysis circuits (ABT, ALT), and in these periods they 

convert the same indexes into a second set of indexes (j₄) 
which can be coded with a lower number of bits and which is 

inserted into the coded signal in place of the first set.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital speech coders,
and more particularly it concerns a method and a device for
the quantization of spectral parameters in these coders.Speech coding systems allowing obtaining a high quality
coded speech at a low bit rate are becoming more and more
interesting. A reduction in bit rate allows for example
devoting more resources to the redundancy required for
protecting information in fixed rate transmissions, or
reducing average rate in variable rate transmission.Techniques enabling the attainment of this purpose are
particularly the linear prediction coding (LPC) techniques,
exploiting speech spectral characteristics.For reducing bit rate it has already been proposed to
exploit the correlation existing between certain spectral
parameters within a signal frame or between successive signal
frames, to avoid transmitting information which can easily be
predicted and hence reconstructed at the receiver. Examples
of these proposals are described in the paper "Low bit-rate
quantization of LSP parameters using two-dimensional differential
coding" by Chih-Chung Kuo et al., ICASSP-92, S. Francis-co, 
USA, 23-26 March 1992, pages I-97 to I-100, and "A long
history quantization approach to scalar and vector quantization
of LSP coefficients", by C.S. Xideas and K.K.M. So,
ICASSP-93, Minneapolis, USA, 27-30 April 1993, pages II-1 to
II-4.The first paper is based on linear prediction of the line
spectrum pairs within the same frame and between successive
frames, so that only prediction residuals are to be quantized
and coded. The possibility of scalar or vector quantization
of these residuals is provided. The quantization law is fixed,
and so it can take into account only an "average" correlation,
entailing a limited improvement with respect to the conventional
technique.The second paper discloses quantization of a group of
parameters related to a certain frame with a codebook comprising
the N groups of decoded parameters relevant to the N
preceding frames or to a set of N frames extracted from the
previous frames, so that only the particular group index is
to be transmitted. In this case too scalar or vector quantization
can be used. The drawback of this technique is that the
use of an adaptive codebook, based on signal decoding results,
makes the coder particularly sensitive to channel errors.EP 0 331 858 discloses a multi rate CELP coder comprising
cascaded CELP coding stages (in particular two stages), each
stage providing respective pairs of codeword address and gain
data.
