<ABSTRACT>
A diversity antenna communiation system for mounting on and use 
with a mobile body. The system includes at least two receiving 

systems having different propagation paths from one another. 
During the transmission, a radio wave is radiated. Upon 

reception, the reception levels of each receiving system are 
monitored to control reception. According to a first embodiment 

of the invention, the output signals of those receiving systems 
momentarily not in use are attenuated by a certain degree in order 

to reduce the switching frequency between receiving systems having 
substantially the same output level. According to a second 

embodiment of the invention, the output signals of those receiving 
systems momentarily not in use are compared with a first threshold 

level which is different from a second threshold level with which 
the momentarily used input signal is compared.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a diversity signal receiving apparatus as indicated in the precharacterizing part of claim 1. In a signal communication between mobile bodies (mobile 
stations) which is carried out mainly with radiowaves 
modulated with digital data, a propagation path on the ground 
is a multipath type propagation path, and therefore the 
envelope and phase of a radio wave fluctuate randomly in 
accordance with the Rayleigh's distribution law and the 
uniform distribution law, respectively, (i.e., the radio wave 
suffers from fading). In order to reduce such fading, there 
is a diversity receiving antenna communication system in which 
the receiving system is changed over from one receiving 
antenna to another. Conventional diversity receiving antenna communication systems 
are used primarily on a mobile body, and, for example, 
diversity systems using space, polarization, arrival angles, 
time and frequency have been utilized. Of those systems, a 
diversity receiving antenna communication system using an  
 
arrival angle is best suited for being mounted on a ground 
mobile station (such as a vehicle, or the like) because of its 
compactness and its ability to reduce fading in a mobile body 
which remarkably changes its traveling direction. A diversity signal receiving apparatus employed in the 
above-described diversity antenna communication system is 
shown in Fig. 1. That is, two signal receiving antennas 3a 
and 3b provided for different signal propagation paths are 
connected to two distributors 4a and 4b, respectively. The 
first distributor 4a is connected to a signal receiver 6 and 
to a first level monitor circuit 12; whereas the second 
distributor 4b is connected to a second level monitor circuit 
13 and to a dummy resistor 14 equivalent in impedance to the 
signal receiver 6. The two level monitor circuits 12 and 13 
are connected to a level comparison circuit 8. The distributors 4a and 4b operate to distribute signals 
received through the receiving antennas 3a and 3b to loads 
(the receiver 6 and the dummy resistor 14) and to the level 
monitor circuits 12 and 13, respectively. The level monitor 
circuits 12 and 13 monitor the levels of the signal received 
through the distributors 4a and 4b (hereinafter referred to as 
"reception levels", when applicable). The level comparison 
circuit 8 compares the reception levels monitored by the level 
monitor circuits 12 and 13 with each other for detection of 
the reversal of the reception levels, so that in the signal 
receiving system
