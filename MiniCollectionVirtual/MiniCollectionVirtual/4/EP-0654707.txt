<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic
developer/amplifier solutions useful in redox
amplification processes.Redox amplification processes have been
described, for example in British Specification Nos.
1,268,126, 1,399,481, 1,403,418 and 1,560,572. In
such processes colour materials are developed to
produce a silver image (which may contain only small
amounts of silver) and then treated with a redox
amplifying solution (or a combined developer-amplifier)
to form a dye image.The developer-amplifier solution contains a
colour developing agent and an oxidising agent which
will oxidise the colour developing agent in the
presence of the silver image which acts as a catalyst.Oxidised colour developer reacts with a colour
coupler to form the image dye. The amount of dye
formed depends on the time of treatment or the
availability of colour coupler and is less dependent
on the amount of silver in the image as is the case in
conventional colour development processes.Examples of suitable oxidising agents include
peroxy compounds including hydrogen peroxide and
compounds which provide hydrogen peroxide, eg addition
compounds of hydrogen peroxide; cobalt (III) complexes
including cobalt hexammine complexes; and periodates.
Mixtures of such compounds can also be used.A serious problem with developer/amplifier
solutions is their stability because they contain both
an oxidising agent (eg the peroxide) and a reducing 
agent (the colour developing agent) which react
together spontaneously thus leading to loss of
activity in a matter of an hour or two.In comparison, conventional photographic colour
developer solutions suffer loss of activity by aerial
oxidation of the colour developing agent. A typical
commercial colour developer solution, however, will be
stable for a week or two. Both diethylhydroxylamine
and hydroxylamine sulphate have been proposed as antioxidants
for colour developer solutions.Colour developer solutions for silver chloride
colour papers do not contain hydroxylamine sulphate
because it can act as a black and white developing
agent and this severely inhibits dye yield. Instead,
diethylhydroxylamine is used because it does not
inhibit dye yield.When using low silver colour papers closely
related to currently used silver chloride colour
papers to be processed in a redox developer/amplifier
it has been found that diethylhydroxylamine works as
an effective antioxidant at first but its oxidation
products cause a severe loss of hydrogen peroxide
after a few hours.Adding hydroxylamine sulphate to a
developer/a
