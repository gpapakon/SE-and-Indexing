<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic holding dowel (1) having a bolt-like base body (2) and a termination flange (3), the base body (2) exhibiting at least two regions (4) which extend in the longitudinal direction, are drawn in in a fold-like manner and between which there are arranged latching elements (8, 9) which are located on the circumference of the base body (2), opposite the termination flange (3). At the end opposite the termination flange (3), the base body (2) is designed to be open, the latching elements being in the form of webs, having a run-on ramp (17), a central region (18) which runs essentially parallel to the base body (2), and a latching ramp (19) which is directed towards the underside of the termination flange (3). Furthermore, the termination flange (3) is provided, above the respective latching mount (19), with a continuous cutout (12, 15) which passes through the wall (16) of the base body (2) to beneath the termination flange (3).

Retaining dowel made of plastic, having a bolt-like 
basic body and a termination flange, the basic body 

having at least two longitudinally extending regions 
which are drawn in in the manner of folds and between 

which the circumference of the basic body is provided 
with latching elements which are located opposite the 

termination flange, characterized in that the basic body 
(2) is designed to be open at the end which is located 

opposite the termination flange (3), in that the latching 
elements (8, 9, 10, 11) are of a web-like form with a 

run-on ramp (17), a central region (18), which runs 
essentially parallel to the basic body (2), and a latching 

ramp (19), which is directed towards the underside of 
the termination flange (3), and in that the termination 

flange (3) is provided, above the respective latching 
ramp (19), with a through-passage (12, 13, 14, 15) which 

passes through the wall (16) of the basic body (2) 
beneath the termination flange (3). 
Retaining dowel according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the depth (T) of the through-passage (12, 

13, 14, 15) is smaller than the distance (A) between the 
underside of the termination flange (3) and the latching 

ramp (19). 
Retaining dowel according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the width (B) of the through-passage 

(12, 13, 14, 15) in the termination flange (3) is 
greater than the width (b) of the latching element (8, 9, 

10, 11) located therebeneath. 
Retaining dowel according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the basic body (2) is of  

 
cylindrical design and has four mutually opposite regions 

(4, 5, 6, 7) which are drawn in in the manner of folds 
and between which the circumference is provided with four 

latching elements (8, 9, 10, 11). 
Retaining dowel according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the regions (4, 5, 6, 7) 

which are drawn in in the manner of folds are each 
designed in the form of a U. 
Retaining dowel according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the open end of the basic 

body (2) is designed to taper conically, the end regions 
(21) of the regions (4, 5, 6, 7) which are drawn in in 

the manner of folds projecting beyond the end regions 
(20) of the smooth circumference of the basic body (2). 
Retaining dowel according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the respective region of 

the smooth circumference (22) of the basic body (2) is 
greater than the width of the adjacent region (4, 5, 6, 

7) which is drawn in in the manner of a fold. 
Retaining dowel according to Claims 1 and 7, 
characterized in that the respective latching element (8, 

9, 10, 11) is arranged in the centre of the respective 
region of the smooth circumference (22) of the basic body 

(2). 
Retaining dowel according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the termination flange (3) has, at the top, 

a central region (23) which is indented in the manner of 
a bowl. 
Retaining dowel according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that at least one fastening element is arranged 

above the termination flange (3).
