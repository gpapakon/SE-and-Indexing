<ABSTRACT>
The method enables the setting of the system parameters of the balance and the input of the commands necessary during weighing with one single bar-shaped key. The parameters can be selected in each plane of the menu structure, constructed as a tree, by actuating the key directly below the description of the parameter. The key always exhibits only precisely as many "regions" as parameters are displayed in the display field.

A method of selecting and configuring weighing programs in a
balance having a key panel (5) and a display panel (3), wherein selection

of the operations and configuration of the parameters of the weighing
programs is effected with a key (11) of the key panel (5) which is

arranged beneath the display panel (3) and which does not serve for
zeroing, with mutually juxtaposed variable switching regions which

respectively correspond to the operations or parameters displayed over the

key portions in the display panel (3), insofar as the key (11) can be
freely divided up.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the key (11) is of a bar-shaped
configuration and is subdivided in its longitudinal extent (x-co-ordinate)

in program dependency into individual portions of variable width
which serve as individual switching regions.
A method according to one of claims 1 and 2 wherein

by touching the bar-shaped key (11) arranged beneath the display
panel (3) the operation displayed thereabove is selected,
thereafter the display panel (3) displays over the key (11) the
sub-operations or sub-functions belonging to the selected operation,
the desired sub-operation or sub-function is selected until all
parameters are set, and
by actuation of the switching regions in the display panel (3),
which correspond to the selected and set parameters, the weighing

parameters appear and can be selected for the weighing operation by
actuation of the key (11) beneath the displayed parameter.
An electronic balance having a weighing cell, a digital signal
processing unit for processing and displaying different weighing programs,

a display panel (3) for alphanumeric display of the operations,
measurement values and parameters, and a key panel (5) for zeroing of the 

display and for the selection and configuration of one of the weighing
programs displayed in the display panel (3), characterised in that the key

panel (5) has at least two keys (7, 11), wherein a first key (7) is
intended for zeroing and at least one second key (11) is in the form of a

bar-shaped sensor key panel, is arranged adjacent to the display panel (3)
and is subdivided in the direction of the x-co-ordinate into individual

switching regions of small width, and the key (11) can be freely divided
up to afford a small width so that associated with the respective

operations or parameters displayed in the display panel (3) over the key
portions are corresponding variable switching regions.
A balance according to claim 4 characterised in that at least
the second key (11) is designed on the potentiometer principle or a

similar principle which variably subdivides the key in the direction of
the x-co-ordinate.
A balance according to one of claims 4 and 5 characterised in
that each key region on the key (11) is associated with the parameter

respectively displayed over the key region in an adjacent line (13) of the
display panel (3).
