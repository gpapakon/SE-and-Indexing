<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for alloying a workpiece using a laser beam, carbon essentially being used as alloying element. According to the invention, an organic, combustible gas or gas mixture is burnt, the alloy coating is formed on the workpiece surface by adsorption of the carbon particles produced during the combustion, the carbon is fed at least partly into the molten mass produced by the laser beam and the workpiece is thus alloyed at the coated locations irradiated by the laser. The combustion flame of the fuel gas or fuel-gas mixture is advantageously directed by means of a burner onto the surface to be coated. Acetylene is preferably used as the organic fuel gas. The fuel-gas mixture, apart from the organic fuel gas, advantageously receives a gas containing oxygen, such as air, air enriched with oxygen, or pure oxygen.

<CLAIMS>
Process for alloying a workpiece using laser 
radiation, wherein
 carbon is essentially employed as 
alloying element, characterised in that an organic 

combustible gas or gas mixture is burnt, in that the 
alloy coating is formed on the surface of the workpiece 

through deposition of the carbon particles produced 
during burning and in that the carbon is at least 

partially introduced into the melt produced by the laser 
beam and hence the workpiece is alloyed in the coated and 

laser-irradiated locations. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the combustion flame of the combustible gas or 

combustible gas mixture is directed onto the surface to 
be coated by means of a burner. 
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that 
a gap of between 50 and 500 mm, preferably between 50 and 

200 mm, is set between the burner and the surface of the 
workpiece to be coated. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that acetylene and/or another organic 

combustible gas is employed as the organic combustible 
gas. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that in addition to the organic 

combustible gas, the combustible gas mixture contains a 
gas containing oxygen such as air, air enriched with 

oxygen or pure oxygen. 
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the combustible gas mixture contains an oxygen level of 1 

to 5 mol%. 
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the combustible gas mixture contains between 5 and 10% by  

 
volume of air. 
Process according to one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterised in that the control of the burner is 

coupled to the control of the laser processing 
installation. 
Process according to one of claims 2 to 8, 
characterised in that a burner matching the contour of 

the workpiece is used. 
Process according to one of claims 2 to 9, 
characterised in that a coating with a defined geometric 

shape is produced on the surface of the workpiece by 
means of covers and masks.
