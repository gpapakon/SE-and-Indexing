<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
cleaning a curing mold to be used for manufacturing 
elastomer articles, and in particular relates to a 
cleaning method by eliminating curing residual of 
elastomer stuck to the mold without damaging the mold. In this specification, elastomer means rubber or 
rubbery elastic compound before curing by the mold, and 
curing residual means contamination of elastomer and 
compounded carbon black, zinc white and so on which is 
stuck to for example the cavity surface of the mold in 
the course of repeated curing process. A tire curing mold is a typical curing mold, one 
example of which is called an inserter mold. As 
described in Japanese laid-open patent specification 
223108/92 (corresponding to EP-0451832), an inserter 
mold is made of nine or so divided molds each of which 
is made of many pieces, and consequently one inserter 
mold is composed of several hundred pieces. An inserter mold has no air-vent, namely it is a 
spewless type mold due to the reason that about 80 µm 
clearances (slits) between the pieces fulfil the 
function of an air-vent.  
 In general, the above-mentioned curing residual 
stuck to such as the surface of the mold cavity, 
air-vent, inside of slits (clearances) and so on remains 
as it is, and the amount of the curing residual 
increases after repetition of the curing process. As 
curing residual stuck to the mold has an adverse 
influence on the quality of elastomer articles, it is 
necessary to remove the same. Usually, the mold is 
cleaned to remove curing residual at the predetermined 
frequency of the curing process. The shot blast method and liquid cleaning method are 
known as typical methods for cleaning molds. The shot blast method is a method for cleaning the 
mold by blowing plastics beads at high pressure onto the 
mold. The liquid cleaning method is a method for 
cleaning the mold by utilizing strong acid such as 
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or nitric acid or 
strong alkali such as caustic soda or amine liquid of 
organic alkali. There are some difficulties in the above-mentioned 
prior art mold cleaning methods. In the case of the 
shot blast method, as for curing residual stuck to the 
cavity surface of the mold, it is possible to clean the 
same by means of hitting directly by blowing plastics 
beads at high pressure, but as for curing residual stuck  
 
to the air-vent and inside of slits (clearances) such as 
in a tire curing mold, plastics beads cannot reach there 
directly and it is impossible to eliminate
