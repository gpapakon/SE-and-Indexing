<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mold for molding a resin which is
composed of a fixed mold and a moving mold and used with a stamper being
attached to a surface of one of the molds forming a cavity when both molds
are closed, a mold for molding, for example, a compact disc, an optical disc, a
magnetic optical disc, a laser disc, or the like, and a method of forming a hard
film at a part to be contacted with a stamper on the surface forming the cavity
for the mold for molding a resin.In the case of fabrication of a disc-shaped record medium such as a
compact disc, an optical disc, a magnetic optical disc, a laser disc, or the like
in which music, image, and the like are recorded, a stamper (a mother die) is
attached to a surface of one (generally a moving mold) of molds of a resin
molding mold composed of a fixed mold and the moving mold forming a
cavity when both molds are closed, and a resin is injected with pressure into
the cavity, thereby molding the resin and simultaneously transferring
projections and depressions on the surface of the stamper.The fixed mold and the moving mold of the resin molding mold
described above are formed made of steel for a resin molding mold and their
stamper mounting face and cavity forming faces are subjected to hardening 
and annealing to improve resistance-to-wear as shown in Japanese Patent
Laid-open Publication No. 62-267937 (JP, 62-267937, A).The stamper mounting face and the cavity forming faces are finished
in a mirror face state, thereby increasing accuracy in dimension of an
injection-molded disc. The stamper is made of nickel, and the face which is
contacted with the stamper mounting face of the mold is finished in a mirror
face state.At the time of injection molding by the above-described resin
molding mold, a molten resin at a high temperature is injected into the cavity
and thus a high pressure applied thereto, whereby the stamper repeats
expansion and shrinkage due to the high temperature and high pressure in
each shot to rub against the surface of the mold forming the cavity, thereby
wearing the surface. Once the stamper mounting face of the mold is worn
out, the stamper is susceptible to flaw and fracture.Though the stamper is replaced with another in accordance with a
disc to be molded, the mold is commonly used and costly, and thus it is
desired to be used for a long term.To this end, it is proposed that a hard layer composed of a material
which is higher in hardness and better in resistance-to-wear than the material
of a mold forming a stamper mounting
