<ABSTRACT>
An object of the invention is to make aureobasidins, useful as an antifungal agent, usable in the form of an emulsified preparation 
for, for example, injection. This preparation contains an aureobasidin, fat or oil, and water as the essential ingredients, 

and an oily phase containing the aureobasidin is dispersed in a water phase to form an emulsion. A preferable concentration of 
the fat or oil ranges from 1 to 30 % w/v. The preparation further contains an emulsifier comprising a phospholipid and/or polyoxyethylene-polyo
xypropylene 
glycol and optionally a dissolution aid comprising an aromatic carboxylic acid and an ester and 

an emulsion stabilizer comprising a higher fatty acid or an acidic phospholipid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an emulsion 
preparation of aureobasidins useful as an antifungal 
agent. The preparation can be used, for example, as an 
injection preparation and the like. Aureobasidins are known compounds and are 
produced, for example, by a strain which belongs to 
Genus Aureobasidium (International Deposit No. FERM-BP1938). 
They are expectedly useful as antifungal 
agents (JP-A-Nos. 2-138296, 3-22995 and 3-44398). 
Mycosis profunda is a fatal disease to such patients 
under immunosuppressive conditions as are suffering 
from cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and 
the like or have undergone organ transplantation, and 
has been increasing in recent years. For these 
patients under grave conditions, a preparation of 
aureobasidins which can be administered by injection is 
eagerly awaited. Aureobasidins are cyclic peptides substantially 
insoluble in water and can difficultly be 
made up into an injection preparation by dissolution in 
water. A generally used method for making up a water-insoluble  
 
medicine into an injection preparation is 
micellization by using a nonionic surface active agent. 
For example, it is widely practiced to form injection 
preparations of fat-soluble vitamins by solubilizing 
them in water with the aid of surface active agents. 
As an example of antifungal agents, a preparation of 
miconazole solubilized with the aid of a surface active 
agent is available on the market as an injection 
preparation. As to cyclosporin A, which is a cyclic 
peptide sparingly soluble in water, also an injection 
preparation is prepared by solubilizing it with a 
surface active agent and is on the market. Surface 
active agents generally used for making injection 
preparations include nonionic surface active agents 
which exhibit low kemolytic effect and low tissue 
injuring effect, polyoxyethylene castor oil derivatives, 
polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 
derivatives, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid 
esters, and polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycols. 
Among these active agents, polyoxyethylene castor oil 
derivatives and polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 
derivatives are known to cause anaphylactic shocks on 
rare occasions when injected in some of the patients 
and hence their use is not preferable. Further, 
aureobasidins are very difficult to solubilize through 
micelle formation, and cannot be solubilized by use of 
polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene 
polyoxypropylene glycols.  Accordingly, the development of a
