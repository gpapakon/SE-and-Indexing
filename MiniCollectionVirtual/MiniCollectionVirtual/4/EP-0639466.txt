<ABSTRACT>
In a rotary stencil printer in which a back press roller 12 is 
provided with a transverse groove 26 for receiving a transverse bar 16 

of a printing drum 10 and a printing sheet applied with a printing at a 
nipping region 32 between the printing drum and the back press roller 

is transferred for a while as attached onto the cylindrical outer 
circumferential surface of the back press roller by a pinch roller or 

rollers 40 provided at an outlet side of the nipping region so as to 
press at a side edge portion or portions of the printing sheet against 

the outer circumferential surface of the back press roller, the position 
control of the pinch roller or rollers to conform to the sheet width is 

carried out in a condition that the pinch roller or rollers are aligned 
with the transverse groove of the back press roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary stencil printer, and more 
particularly to a rotary stencil printer having a pinch roller or rollers 
adapted to press at least one of opposite side edge portions of a sheet 
discharged from a nipping region between a printing drum and a back 
press roller against the back press roller such that the sheet moves 
for a while as attached onto the back press roller. In the stencil printing art according to which ink is supplied on 
one surface of a stencil sheet in the form of a layer, then the stencil 
sheet is laid on a surface to receive printing so as to be in contact 
therewith at the other surface thereof, and then a pressing force is 
applied to the ink layer by a pressing means such that the ink of the 
ink layer is transferred from said one surface to said other surface 
of the stencil sheet thereby giving an ink image on the surface to 
receive printing, it has been proposed by Japanese Patent Laid-open 
Publication 4-361043 to accomplish such a stencil printing in a manner 
of hardly causing a back inking of the printed sheets even when they 
are laid one over the other just after the printing according to such an 
art that after the ink has been transferred through the perforations of 
the stencil sheet, the printed surface is detached from the stencil sheet 
while the pressing means is still kept in its pressing position such that 
the ink of the ink layer is substantially kept under the control of the 
pressing means against flowing relative to the stencil sheet, whereby 
when the printed sheet is removed from the stencil sheet, the ink is 
retained on the stencil sheet not to be drawn out of the ink layer due 
to the viscosity of the ink, thereby preventing any excessive ink from 
being transferred onto the printed surface. In the above-mentioned publication, there is shown an embodiment 
for carrying out such a stencil printing art in a rotary stencil printer, 
according to which a printing sheet nipped between a printing drum 
bearing a perforated stencil sheet around a cylindrical circumferential 
surface thereof and a back press roller and applied with a printing at 
the nipping region under an action of an inking roller acting as a  
 
means for pressing ink from the inside of the printing drum to thereby 
urge the ink radially outwardly of the printing drum is moved for a 
while as attached onto a cylindrical circumferential surface of the 
back press roller such that the printing sheet moving along an arcuate 
contour of the movement of the

<CLAIMS>
A rotary stencil printer comprising a printing drum (10) and a 
back press roller (12) adapted to rotate about each central axis 

thereof, said printing drum having a transverse bar (16) for mounting 
a leading edge of a stencil sheet along a generatrix of a cylindrical 

circumferential surface of the printing drum, 
said back press roller having a 

transverse groove (26) along a generatrix of a cylindrical 
circumferential surface of the back press roller 

arranged to meet with said transverse 
bar of said printing drum for receiving said transverse bar therein, 

wherein a sheet discharged from a nipping region (32) between said 
printing drum and said back press roller with a print being applied 

thereon in said nipping region moves for a while as attached onto the 
cylindrical circumferential surface of said back press roller with at 

least one side edge portion thereof being pressed against the cylindrical 
circumferential surface of said back press roller by at least one pinch 

roller (40), characterized by further comprising a pinch roller position 
adjusting means (42-62) for adjusting an axial position of said pinch 

roller (40) so as to conform to a width of the sheet, said pinch roller 
position adjusting means being adapted to move said pinch roller in the 

axial direction for adjustment of the axial position thereof when said 
pinch roller is in alignment with said transverse groove (26) of said 

back press roller. 
A rotary stencil printer according to claim 1, wherein a pair of 
said pinch rollers (40) are provided to be adjustable of the axial 

positions thereof in symmetry with respect to a central position 
therebetween. 
A rotary stencil printer according to claim 2, wherein said pair of 
pinch rollers (40) are each supported by each one of a pair of carries 

(42), while each said carrier is supported by a pair of parallelly 
arranged screw rods (44, 46) extending along the central axis of said 

back press roller (12) through screw engagement between a female 
thread on the side of said carrier and a male thread (44a, 44b, 46a, 

46b) on the side of said rod, wherein helical directions of said female  
 

and male threads at the respective screw engagements are arranged 
such that when said pair of rods are rotated in synchronization with 

one another in relatively opposite directions, said pair of carries 
approach to one another or depart from one another according to 

direction of rotation with respect of one of said pair of rods. 
A rotary stencil printer according to claim 3, wherein when the 
axial positions of said pinch rollers (40) are readjusted, said pair of 

carries are first moved to respective home positions at which they are 
departed to be remotest from one another unless they are already at 

said home positions, and then said pair of carries are moved to 
approach to one another as much as a controlled amount.
