<DESCRIPTION>
 MODIFIED GENES AND THEIR EXPRESSION IN PLANT CELLSThis invention provides a modified gene, such as Bacillus thuringiensis ("Bt") gene (the "modified Bt ICP gene") encoding all or an insecticidally-effective portion of a Bt insecticidal crystal protein ("ICP") . A plant, transformed wit the modified gene, shows higher expression levels of the encoded protein.Background of the InventionPlant genetic engineering technology has made significant progress during the last 10 years. It has become possible to introduce stably foreign genes into plants. This has provided exciting opportunities for modern agriculture. Derivatives of the Ti-plasmid of the plant pathogen, Aqrobacterium tumefaciens, have proven to be efficient and highly versatile vehicles for the introduction of foreign genes into plants and plant cells. In addition, a variety of free DNA delivery methods, such as electroporation, microinjection, pollen-mediated gene transfer and particle gun technology, have been developed for the same purpose.The major aim of plant transformations by genetic engineering has been crop improvement. In an initial phase, research has been focussed on the engineering into plants of useful traits such as insect-resistance. In this respect, progress in engineering insect resistance in transgenic plants has been obtained through the use of genes, encoding ICPs, from Bt strains (Vaeck et al, 1987) . A Bt strain is a spore forming gram-positive bacterium that produces a parasporal crystal which is composed of crystal proteins which are specifically toxic against insect larvae. Bt ICPs possess a specific insecticidal spectrum and display no toxicity towards other animals and humans (Gasser and Fraley, 1989) . Therefore, the Bt ICP genes are highly suited for plant engineering purposes. 

 For more than 20 years, Bt crystal spore preparations have been used as biological insecticides. The commercial use of Bt sprays has however been limited by high production costs and the instability of crystal proteins when exposed in the field (Vaeck et al, 1987) . The heterogeneity of Bt strains has been well documented. Strains active against Lepidoptera (Dulmage et al, 1981), Diptera (Goldberg and Margalit, 1977) and Coleoptera (Krieg et al, 1983) have been described.Bt strains produce endogenous crystals upon sporulation. Upon ingestion by insect larvae, the crystals are solubilized in the alkaline environment of the insect idgut giving rise to a protoxin which is subsequently proteolytically converted into a toxic core fragment or
