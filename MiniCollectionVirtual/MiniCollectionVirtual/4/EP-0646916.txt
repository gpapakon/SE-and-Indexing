<ABSTRACT>
A helical scanning magnetic recording apparatus 
utilizing azimuth recording technology includes a reading head (211) 

and a writing (212) head which are arranged with a predetermined 
dimensional relationship. When recording to a recording 

tape (110), the reading head (211) and 
the writing head (212) simultaneously 

record a first track (Tr1) and a second track (Tr2) beside the first 
track (Tr1). Since the writing head (212) is located on the upper stream 

side of the reading head (211), the writing head (212) can be tracked 
on the next track position when the reading head (211) is placed 

over the first and second tracks (Tr1 and Tr2) 
such that the reading head (211) 

can reproduces the first and second 
tracking signals (St2 and St1) having 

the same amplitude.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic 
recording apparatus such as a video tape recorder which 
magnetically records a signal on a recording medium and 
reproduces the recorded signal from the medium utilizing a 
helical scanning method and, more particularly, to a magnetic 
recording apparatus suitable for a high-density recording and 
reproducing with a precise tracking. In a magnetic recording apparatus such as a video 
tape recorder (VTR) or a video cassette tape recorder (VCR) 
which records and reproduces the signals on and from the tape 
by utilizing a helical-scanning technology, the recording 
density becomes more higher year by year. Nowadays, the high-density 
recording such that one bit is recorded in the 
recording area of 1µm² is developed in various fields. Under 
this density, the signal is recorded and reproduced with the 
minimum recording wave length of around 0.4µm at a track pitch 
of around 5µm. To increase the recording density, the signal is 
recorded on the tape such no guard band which does not  
 
contribute to the recording and reproducing signal is formed 
between adjacent tracks. The signal is recorded on thus 
formed tracks by the magnetic head having a magnetic gap 
slanted to the tracing direction, this slanted angle is 
referred to as "Azimuth angle". Adjacent tracks is recorded 
to have different "Azimuth angles" so as to keep from the 
noise signal from the adjacent track. In Fig. 21, an example of conventional two-head 
helical-scan video recorder is shown. A recording tape 110 
is physically wrapped around a rotating-head drum 101A in a 
helical-shaped tape path. During the recording operation, the 
rotating head drum 101A having two magnetic heads 102A and 
102B located on the opposite position is rotated, on a fixed 
lower head drum 101B, in a direction indicated by an arrow Dc. 
The recording tape 110 is fed in a direction indicated by an 
arrow Dt. In Fig. 22, a portion of tape which is azimuth 
recorded by the two magnetic heads 102A and 102B, viewed from 
the head drum side, is shown. Tracks Tr1, Tr2, Tr3, Tr4, and 
Tr5 are consecutively recorded without guard band therebetween 
on the tape 110 diagonally, wherein the first head 102A 
records the track Tr4, and the second head 102B successively 
record the track Tr5 such that a portion of the track Tr4 is  
 
overwritten is by the track Tr5. As a result, the track Tr4 
having the full track pitch is formed on the tape 110. Generally, the heads have a track width greater than 
the track pitch so as to
