<ABSTRACT>
A lead-in device (10) is used during installation of a 
rim-type lock cylinder (12) having a tailpiece (20) in an exit 

mechanism (14) including a cam (18) having a tailpiece 
receiving aperture (16). The lead-in device includes a 

converging tunnel (30) having an exit aperture (36) sized 
to match the tailpiece receiving aperture (16) and an 

entrance aperture (32) that is larger than the exit 
aperture (36). The lead-in device also includes a pair of 

arms (44) positioned to be inserted into the cam aperture (16) 
to hold the exit aperture (36) in registry with the cam aperture (16) 

and to maintain the entrance aperture (32) at a predetermined 
distance from the cam (18). When the arms (44) are positioned 

in the cam aperture (16) and the exit aperture (36) is in 
registry with the cam aperture (16), the converging tunnel 

(30) guides a tailpiece (20) of the lock cylinder (12) 
inserted into the entrance aperture (32) through the exit 

aperture (36) and into the cam aperture (16) to engage the cam (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices used in the 
installation of lock cylinders and more particularly to 
devices used in the installation of lock cylinders having 
a tailpiece for engaging a cam in an exit mechanism. Many buildings have doors that are equipped with panic exit 
mechanisms which generally include a pair of casings, 
mounted near the opposite edges of a door, a panic bar, on 
the interior surface of the door, spanning the door and 
coupled to the casings, and a retractable latch bolt with 
a retraction mechanism coupled to, and actuated by, the 
panic bar. Pushing on the panic bar retracts the latch 
bolt into the casing and releases the door for opening. 
The doors can also be opened from the outside by a 
conventional doorknob or handle. In some situations, it is necessary to provide a panic exit 
mechanism, yet it is undesirable to allow easy access from 
the outside. To improve the security of panic exit 
systems, locks have been installed on the outside of the 
door to actuate locking and unlocking functions. The lock 
allows access from the outside, but only to those who have 
the appropriate key. Typically, the outside lock is a 
rim-type lock cylinder having a tailpiece, which is a long 
rectangular part extending from the rear of the cylinder. 
The lock cylinder is mounted to a trim piece on the door 
and the tailpiece extends through the door to engage and 
rotate a cam located in the casing on the inside of the 
door. The cam generally includes a cruciform mating 
aperture sized for receiving the tailpiece. Rotation of 
the cam operates the locking and unlocking functions of the 
exit mechanism.  The tailpiece is attached to the back of the lock cylinder 
but is free to move from side-to-side and up-and-down. 
This freedom of movement is required to compensate for any 
slight misalignment between the lock cylinder and the cam 
during the installation process. During installation of an 
exit mechanism, the casing is mounted on the inside of the 
door and a trim plate, with a lock cylinder attached, is 
mounted on the outside of the door. The tailpiece extends 
through the door and into the mating aperture of the cam, 
thereby rotationally coupling the lock cylinder to the cam. 
Were the tailpiece to be rigidly attached to the lock 
cylinder, the cam and the lock cylinder would have to be 
precisely aligned. A slight misalignment would prevent the 
tailpiece from entering the mating aperture and thereby 
prevent installation. The freedom of movement of the 
tailpiece

<CLAIMS>
A lead-in device (10) for installing a lock cylinder 
(12) in an exit mechanism (14), the lock cylinder having a 

tailpiece (20) and the exit mechanism including an element 
(18) having a mating aperture (16) for receiving the 

tailpiece therein, characterised in that the lead-in device 
(10) comprises guiding means (30, 44) for guiding the 

tailpiece (12) into the mating aperture (16); and coupling 
means (40, 56) for coupling the guiding means to the 

element (18) having the mating aperture (16), the coupling 
means being attached to the guiding means. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein the guiding 
means includes a plurality of walls (22, 24, 26, 28) 

defining a tunnel (30) having an entrance aperture (32) and 
an exit aperture (36). 
A device according to claim 2, wherein said plurality 
of walls (22, 24, 26, 28) converge from the entrance 

aperture to the exit aperture so that the entrance aperture 
is larger than the exit aperture. 
A device according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the tunnel 
(30) includes a longitudinal axis (42) and the coupling 

means includes a pair of flexible arms (44) extending from 
the guiding means parallel to the longitudinal axis, each 

arm including a finger (56) for engaging a surface of the 
element (18) having the mating aperture to position the 

exit of the tunnel adjacent the aperture. 
A device according to claim 4, wherein the flexible 
arms (44) extend in parallel spaced-apart relation to each 

other and the finger (56) on each arm projects away from
