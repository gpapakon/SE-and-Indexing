A dispensing bottle for a product protected from the air in a flexible pocket (4), characterized in 
that it comprises: 


a rigid body (1) with means (11, 13) for positioning an intermediate part (15) of the pocket; 
a push cap (6, 7) mounted on the body and to which the neck (19) of the pocket is fixed in 
sealed manner, the push cap delimiting an outlet chamber (38) which has an inlet orifice (29) 

communicating with the pocket and an outlet duct (31) provided with a non-return outlet valve (8); 
a spring (9) tending to extend the push cap from the body; and 
a non-return feed valve (5) integral with a part (17) of the pocket upstream of the said inlet 
orifice (29) and delimiting with the push cap a feed chamber (37) for the outlet chamber (38). 
A bottle according to claim 1, characterized in that the non-return feed valve (5) is a lip seal (22). 
A bottle according to claim 2, characterized in that the lip (22) of the non-return feed valve (5) 
cooperates with a cylindrical extension (28) of the push cap (6, 7) which extends into the pocket (4) 

from the inlet orifice (29). 
A bottle according to claim 3, characterized in that the extension (28) comprises a valve (42) for 
refilling the pocket (4). 
A bottle according to claim 4, characterized in that the push cap (6, 7) comprises a first part (6) 
provided with the said extension (17), which is fixed to, in particular crimped to, the neck (19) of the 

pocket (4), and a second part (7) which is mounted on this first part. 
A bottle according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the push cap (6, 7) is 
screwed on to a thread (20) formed on the neck (19) of the pocket. 
A bottle according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the part (18) of the pocket 
(4) located downstream of the non-return feed valve (5) is in the form of a bellows, this non-return 

valve being fixed to a restricted part (17) of the pocket. 
A bottle according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the rigid body (1) comprises 
an upstream part (2) in the form of a cup provided with at least one vent (10) and an abutment surface  

 
(11) for the said intermediate part (15) of the pocket (4), and a downstream part (3) which is nested 

with the upstream part and has a surface (13) retaining this intermediate part on the abutment surface. 
A bottle according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the downstream part (3) of 
the body (1) comprises means (13) for guiding the part (18) of the pocket (4) located downstream of the 

non-return feed valve (5). 
A bottle according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the non-return outlet valve 
(8) comprises a sleeve which ends in a convergent, flexible lip (35), this lip cooperating in particular 

with a core (33) which passes through the outlet duct (31) with play and is integral with the push cap 
(6, 7).
