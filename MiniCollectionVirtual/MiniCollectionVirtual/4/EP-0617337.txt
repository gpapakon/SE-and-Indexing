<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for
developing an electrostatic image, which is for use in
electrophotography, an electrostatic recording process,
an electrostatic printing process, and the like.In the electrophotography, electrostatic recording
process and electrostatic printing process, an electrostatic
image formed on an electrostatic image support is visualized
by toner particles prepared by dispersing a colorant in a
resin. The so-visualized image is directly fixed on the
electrostatic image support, or it is transferred to other
support and fixed. Therefore, the toner is required to have
not only excellent development properties but also excellent
fixing strength. In recent years, particularly, the
accomplishment of low-energy fixing is strongly required in
view of energy saving.A heat fixing method includes a non-contact heat
fixing method using an oven and a contact heat fixing method
using a hot roller. The contact heat fixing method meets
the demands of the times in view of energy saving, since it
achieves high heat efficiency, requires not much electric
power in a fixing portion and permits the downsizing of the
fixing portion. However, the problem with this method is
that an "offset" occurs. The "offset" refers to the
following phenomenon; Part of a toner forming an image
adheres to a hot roller surface, and the transferred toner
is then transferred to a support on which an image to be
fixed is formed, whereby the image is stained. For
preventing this offset phenomenon, a variety of proposals 
have been made and some of them have been put to practical
use.For example, it is a widely employed practice to
incorporate a compound having releasability such as a wax
into a toner. However, this proposal has not succeeded in a
low-energy fixing. It has been also proposed to use a
polymer having a high molecular weight as a resin which is
to compose a toner. The toner containing a polymer having a
high molecular weight can prevent the offset, while it has a
high softening point so that the fixing temperature is high.
It is hence difficult to perform the low-energy fixing.
Further impractically, the resin becomes tough so that it
is difficult to pulverize the resin at the time of producing
a toner. For overcoming these problems, it has been
proposed to use a vinyl polymer, such as polystyrene, as a
polymer having a broad molecular weight distribution, from
a low molecular weight to a high molecular weight. This
toner satisfies the offset prevention and the fixing
strength to some extent,
