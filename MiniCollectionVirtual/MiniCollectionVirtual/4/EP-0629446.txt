<ABSTRACT>
A retention and positioning device (50) is disclosed 
for a crusher (10) having a main frame (12) with an upper 

seat (16), and an upper frame (32) held in releasably biased 
relation to the main frame (12) and including a portion (42) 

engaging the upper seat during normal operation. The 
retaining and positioning device includes a bracket (52) 

constructed and arranged for retention upon the upper seat 
during operation of the crusher, the bracket defining at 

least one pad aperture (62), and at least one shock 
absorbing pad (74) configured for retention in each 

aperture. During operation of the crusher, when the upper 
frame is momentarily displaced from engagement with the main 

frame, the return of the upper frame to the upper seat is 
cushioned by the at least one pad.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to mineral 
comminution devices, and particularly to conical rock crushers 
in which an upper frame is held in releasably biased 
relationship against a fixed main frame. Conical type rock crushers of the type contemplated 
for use with the present retention and positioning device 
include a fixed main frame enclosing a gyrating conical head. 
The gyrating head defines a lower crushing surface. An upper 
frame or bowl is held in releasably biased relationship 
against an upper seat of the main frame, usually by a 
plurality of coiled springs, fluid power cylinders, or a 
combination of the two. The bowl includes a bowl liner which 
defines a normally fixed upper crushing surface. Incoming 
mineral material is fed between the upper and lower crushing 
surfaces where it is reduced to a specified size or smaller. 
Such a crusher is disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. Patent 
No. 4,478,373, which is incorporated by reference herein. During operation, the bowl is maintained in a 
biased, contacting relationship to the upper seat, however, in 
a process known as tramp release, the bowl may lift upon the 
introduction of uncrushable matter or tramp material with the 
feed material. Once the tramp material has been passed, the 
bowl returns to contact the upper seat, usually with a 
forceful impact which causes high localized stresses, and may 
in some cases result in damage and failure to the upper seat 
area or corresponding regions of the bowl. Attempts at lessening the stresses generated by the 
shock of the reseating bowl have typically involved the 
insertion of shock absorbing material between the upper seat  
 
and the bowl. One such attempt is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,773,604, wherein the main frame has a separate upper 
seat provided with a plurality of annular grooves. A like 
plurality of rings of resilient material are inserted into the 
grooves and retained there by compression. The resilient 
rings are dimensioned to project above the surface of the 
upper seat and thus form a shock absorbent cushion for the 
bowl. However, a significant drawback of such an 
arrangement is that in some cases, the resilient inserts are 
not adequately retained within the grooves, and may have the 
tendency to dislodge during operation. In addition, the shock 
absorbing material of which the inserts are made has the 
tendency to collapse or migrate due to the extreme forces 
generated by the bowl returning to its normal operating 
position. Another design consideration

<CLAIMS>
A retention and positioning device (50) for a crusher 
(10) having a main frame (12) with an upper seat (16), and 

an upper frame (32) held in releasably biased relation to 
the main frame and including a portion (42) configured for 

engaging the upper seat during normal operation, said 
retaining and positioning device (50) characterised by: 

   bracket means (52, 54, 56) constructed and arranged 
for retention upon the upper seat, said bracket means 

defining at least one pad aperture (62); and 
   at least one shock absorbing pad (74) configured for 

retention in each said aperture (62), so that during 
operation of the crusher, when the upper frame is 

momentarily displaced from engagement with the main frame, 
the return of the upper frame to the upper seat is cushioned 

by said at least one pad. 
The device according to Claim 1 characterised by said 
bracket means (52, 54, 56) being constructed to be loosely 

retained upon the upper seat (16) during crusher operation. 
The device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 
characterised by said bracket means including a retaining 

ring (54), and a first pad retention ring (56) secured to 
said retaining ring and having a first plurality of 

arcuately spaced pad apertures (62). 
The device according to Claim 3 characterised by said 
retaining ring being a generally vertically disposed band 

dimensioned to circumscribe an inner edge of the upper seat. 
The device according to Claim 3 or Claim 4 
characterised by said bracket means further including a 

second pad retention ring (68) having a second plurality of 
pad apertures (70) and secured to said first ring (54) in 

radially displaced relation. 
The device according to Claim 5 characterised by said 
second pad retention ring (68) being disposed at a declining 

angle relative to said first ring (56). 
The device according to Claim 5 or Claim 6 further 
characterised by a first plurality of said at least one pad 

(74) for disposition in said first plurality of pad 
 

apertures (62), and a second plurality of said at least one 
pad (76) for disposition in said second plurality of pad 

apertures (70), wherein each of said first plurality of pads 
is substantially square in cross-section, and has a height 

which is greater than the height of each pad of said second 
plurality of pads. 
The device according to any one of Claims 5 to 7 
further characterised by first support means on said bracket 

means for supporting a junction of said second pad retention 
ring (68) and said first pad retention ring (56). 
The device according to Claim 8 characterised by said 
first support means including gussets (72) adjoining said 

second ring and said first ring. 
The device according to Claim 8 or Claim 9 further 
characterised by second support means (58) on said bracket 

means for supporting a junction of said retaining ring (68) 
and said first pad retaining ring of pad apertures (56).
