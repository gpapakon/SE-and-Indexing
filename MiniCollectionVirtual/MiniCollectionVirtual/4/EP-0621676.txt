<ABSTRACT>
Method of counting the energy consumed by a set of electrical appliances (10, 20, 40, 70) linked to a local energy distribution mains (R) and capable of communicating directionally with each other and with energy management means (30) also linked to the mains (R). At the site of each appliance (10, 20, 40, 70), energy consumption estimates are made, the corresponding estimation information is stored, and this information is then transmitted via the mains (R) to the energy management means (30) in order to be processed and analysed there.
