<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved electrical connector having 
at least one detachable spacer (14). The spacer is 

positioned so as to leave a space (25) large enough for 
terminals (23) to be inserted into the connector housing 

(1) without interference with the overlying spacer (14) or 
the spacer is adapted to float in response to the insertion 

of terminals after the terminals are located in the final 
terminal setting position. The spacer (14) is moved into 

the final spacer mounting position, in which position 
latching projection (18) of the locking arms (17) of the 

spacer are fitted into the slots (8) of top wall (4) of the 
housing and at the same time, latching projections (18) 

lock the underlying terminals, in the connector housing. 
To remove the spacer and hence the terminals from the 

connector housing it suffices that the spacer is raised up 
by its front edge to rotate until the latching projections 

(18) are released from the slots (8). In the electrical 
connector no load is applied to terminals by the overlying 

spacer when the terminals are inserted and moved to the 
final terminal-mounting positions minimizing incomplete 

mounting of the terminals. All the locking arms (17) of 
the spacer apply equal holding forces to the terminals; 

and rotating of the spacer permits removal of the spacer 
(and hence the terminals) from the connector housing 

without requiring extra tools.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical connector 
having at least one detachable spacer to lock electrical 
terminals inserted in terminal-receiving cavities to 
prevent the terminals from being pulled out of the 
connector housing. Electrical connectors having detachable spacers are 
known in the art. In one typical application a detachable 
spacer is provisionally inserted in a connector in the 
space defined between a top wall of the housing and the 
terminal receiving cavity. Terminals are then inserted 
into the terminal receiving cavities passing under the 
overlying spacer to the final terminal mounting position. 
The spacer is then moved forward until it has reached the 
final spacer mounting position locking the terminals in 
place. One example of such locking spacer used with an 
electrical connector is proposed in Japanese Utility Model 
Application, Public Disclosure No. 63-56573. The detachable spacer has a plurality of resilient 
latching arms extending from its base and two locking 
projections extending from each side of the spacer. The 
connector housing has two slots on each side wall adapted 
to receive the two locking projections of the spacer. 
First, the spacer is moved into the housing until the  
 
locking projection on each side of the spacer has been 
engaged by the respective slot of each side wall of the 
housing. This constitutes the spacer's primary mounting 
position. The terminals are then inserted into the 
terminal cavities while abutting the resilient arms of the 
overlying spacer until the terminals reach the final 
terminal-mounting position. Thereafter, the spacer is 
moved to its final spacer-mounting position at which time 
the latching arms apply a pushing force to the terminals 
locking the terminals in the housing. In this final 
spacer-mounting position the two locking projections of 
each side of the spacer are engaged by the two slots of 
each side wall of the housing. To remove the spacer from 
the housing, it is necessary to expand, with the aid of a 
tool, the two opposite side walls of the housing wide 
enough to allow the two locking projections of each side of 
the spacer to be released from the slots in each side wall 
of the housing. After the spacer is removed from the 
housing, the terminals may also be removed. The above described connector has the following 
disadvantages: First, the terminals are subjected to a force applied 
by the latching arms of the overlying spacer while being 
inserted into the connector housing until they have reached 
the

An electrical connector with a terminal retaining 
spacer (14), comprising, 


a connector housing (1) having top (4) and a pair 
of side walls (9), a plurality of terminal receiving 

cavities (2) extending therethrough to receive electrical 
terminals (23), 
the housing having a front opening and guide 
slots (10) in the side walls (9) to receive and guide the 

terminal retaining spacer, 
a terminal retaining spacer (14) mounted to the 
front portion of the housing in two steps, first 

provisionally engaged position and second in fully engaged 
position, the terminal retaining spacer has a base (15) and 

a plurality of locking arms (17) extending from a rear edge 
(16) for insertion into terminal retaining cavities, each 

arm (17) terminating in a latching surface (18), 
a pair of guide projections (22) extending from 
two opposite sides (21) of the base (15) each adapted to 

engage a respective guide slot (10) on one of the side 
walls (9), characterised in that the top wall has a plurality of 

apertures (8) each communicating with a respective terminal 
receiving cavity, in that 
when the terminal retaining spacer is mounted to 
the front portion of the housing in the provisionally 

engaged condition, the base of the spacer is supported by 
the housing (1) such that the locking arms (17) are not in 

the terminal receiving cavities (2) and the terminals may 
be inserted underneath the spacer without interfering with 

any portion of the spacer, and in that 
when the terminal retaining spacer (14) is moved 
into the final-engaged condition the latching surfaces (18) 

of the locking arms (17) engage respective apertures (8) in 
the top wall (4) and a portion of the latching surfaces 

(18) project into terminal receiving cavities (2) such that in use to engage 
a locking surface (24) of an inserted terminal (23). 
An electrical connector in accordance with 
claim 1, wherein the top wall (4) covers only a portion of 

the housing (1) and the terminal receiving cavities (2) are 
separated by walls (3) which support the terminal retaining 

spacer (14) in the provisionally engaged position. 
An electrical connector in accordance with 
claim 2, wherein the terminal retaining spacer (14) when in 

fully-mounted position in combination with the top wall (4) 
encloses the top of the housing (1). 
An electrical connector in accordance with
