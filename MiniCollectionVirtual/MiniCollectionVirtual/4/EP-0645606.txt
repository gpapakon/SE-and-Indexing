physical quantities, in particular of temperature or 

humidity. The detector comprises conductor electrodes,

quantity to be measured is measured. Between 

the conductor electrodes there 
is an active material whose impedance 

properties are a function of the physical quantity to 
be measured. The detector is composed of pieces 

cut-off out of a continuous detector filament, 
which detector filament 

comprises a conductive electrode wire or an assembly 
of electrode wires, on/between 

which there is an active material 
whose impedance properties are a function of the 

physical quantity to be measured. Further, a novel 
process is described for the manufacture of said 

detectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an electrical impedance detector for measurement of physical
quantities, in particular of temperature or humidity, which detector comprises
conductor electrodes, between which the electrical impedance that represents the
physical quantity to be measured is measured, and between which electrodes there
is an active material whose impedance properties are a function of the physical
quantity to be measured.Further, the invention concerns a process for manufacture of electrical impedance
detectors, said detector being intended for measurement of physical quantities, in
particular of temperature or relative humidity.In a number of applications, high speed, small size, and low radiation error are
required from measurement detectors, in particular from detectors intended for
measurement of temperature or relative humidity. Said requirements are particularly
strict, e.g., in detectors of radiosondes.As is known in prior art, for example, as temperature detectors of radiosondes, as
a rule, capacitive detectors are used, whose active material is a ceramic whose
dielectricity is dependent on the temperature. The prior-art glass-ceramic temperature
detectors are, however, of relatively large size, and therefore their speed and
radiation error would require some improvement. The radiation error produced by
solar radiation has been the most important problem in the temperature measurement
by radiosondes with the use of prior-art temperature detectors.Besides capacitive detectors, in radiosondes and equivalent, resistive temperature
detectors and thermoelements have also been used. In the prior art, capacitive humidity detectors are known in whose capacitance the
dielectric material used is a polymer, a ceramic, or a glass-ceramic whose dielectric
constant is a function of the humidity absorbed by it. The speed and corresponding
properties of these detectors also require development, in particular in view of
radiosonde applications.As regards the prior-art electrically detected temperature and humidity detectors,
reference is made, e.g., to the US Patents Nos. 3,168,829 and 3,350,941 as well as
to the applicant's FI Patent No. 48,229, in which latter FI patent a capacitive
humidity detector is described in which the dielectric insulating material is a polymer
film whose permittivity is a function of the amount of water absorbed by the
polymer film.The substantial construction of the humidity detector described in said FI patent is
a thin plate, onto whose face a structure sensitive to humidity
