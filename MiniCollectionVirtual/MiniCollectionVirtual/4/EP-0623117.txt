 PYRIMIDIN COMPOUNDS AS HERBICIDES CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending application U.S. Serial No. 07/821,118 filed January 15, 1992,FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel substituted heterocyclic compounds and a method for controlling undesired vegetation in crops including plantation and specialty crops. Some of the compounds of the instant invention have been disclosed previously for use generally as herbicides, but these disclosures provide no teachings for use of these compounds as herbicides in plantation crops.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION U.S. 4,839,229 discloses herbicidal utility in "cotton and soya" cultivations for compounds of the formulawherein, int-_-.r aliaR1 is H, C2-C4 alkyl, C2-C4 haloalkyl, formyl or C2-C6 alkanoyl;R2 is (in part) an ether group;R3 is H or CN; R4 is H or halogen;R5 is H, halogen or C1-C4 alkyl; 

 R6 is CX-C4 alkyl or C1-C haloalkyl; and R5 and R6 together are tri- or tetramethylene. The instant invention provides a method for controlling undesired vegetation in plantation and specialty crops . Many of the compounds of the instant invention have been previously disclosed for use generally as herbicides, and such disclosures are found in U.S. 4,859,229, EP-A-438,209, JP 3-77,874 and EP-A- 408,382. There are, however, no teachings for the use of these compounds as herbicides in plantation and specialty crops such as citrus, sugarcane, coffee, banana, oil palm, loblolly pine, rubber, cocoa, grapes, plantain, pineapple, fruit trees such as apples, and nut trees. These crops are important markets and are cultivated particularly in regions of the Pacific rim and South America. Citrus, sugarcane and loblolly pine also are grown elsewhere.The yields of selected crops such as citrus, sugarcane, coffee, banana, oil palm, loblolly pine, rubber, cocoa, grapes, fruit trees and Bermudagrass tend to be lessened by undesired plantings such as crabgrass, Johnson grass, guineagrass and the like. In addition, the yields of these crops tend to be reduced by crop plants such as corn, cotton, wheat, rice, and the like. A need therefore exists for controlling these types of plantings to improve the yields of selected crops such as those mentioned above.This invention also provides novel substituted heterocyclic compounds and their agriculturally suitable compositions which are generally useful as herbicides, as well as methods of their use as general or selective preemergent or postemergent herbicides, or as plant
