<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pressure operable spring force actuator including a fluid pressure operable assembly 
connected to a force output member (15) movable in a housing (1) to apply output force from 

a power spring (10) within the housing (1), subject to applied fluid pressure at fluid input 
(11) to the actuator to counteract the force of the spring (10), characterised in that said fluid 

pressure operable assembly and said output member (15) comprise respective parts (13,15) 
relatively moveable one within the other, and locking means (23) normally constraining said 

parts (13,15) to move together to apply said output force, and in that release means (29) is 
provided which is actuable externally of said housing (1) and through said output member 

(15) to release said locking means (23) so that said parts (13,15) are freed to move relative 
to one another. The locking means (23) may comprise one or more detent members operable 

by cam means (25), preferably located within an inner one of said parts (13,15). The 
release means (29) may comprise a rigid connection to an external lever (49) or a flexible 

connection such as a wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluid pressure operable spring
force actuators and relates especially to spring force
actuators for use in fluid pressure operable braking systems.In fluid pressure operable braking systems it is known to
provide spring force actuators for applying brake forces to
wheel brakes. Such wheel brakes may typically be cam
operated drum brakes or disc brakes and the actuators may
provide secondary and/or parking brake actuation compressive
forces which are distinct from service brake compressive
forces applied from further service brake actuators. In
contrast, it has been proposed to provide spring brake
actuators which apply tension forces to their linkages. One
basic form of such spring brake actuator for a disc brake
employing a diaphragm is described in European patent
specification No. 0099689.In its bare essentials such a tension actuator comprises a
pressure responsive member which is movable in a housing by
fluid pressure acting upon a fluid pressure responsive member
and the fluid pressure responsive member acts in a sense to
oppose and overcome the force of a power spring. In normal
service of the vehicle, the power spring is held compressed
by the fluid pressure but for secondary and/or parking brake
application, the fluid pressure is 
reduced or removed and the spring then applies tension to
the output member anchor linkage. This ensures that
parking in particular is safely achieved regardless of
subsequent loss of fluid pressure from the brake system.
However, in the event that it is required to move the
vehicle quickly, for example in the event of a threat from a
nearby fire, it is desirable to be able to release the
parking brakes more quickly than may otherwise be achievable
only after recharging the pressures in the brake system by
running the engine.In the case of spring force actuators which operate to
provide compressive forces it has already been proposed in
U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,080,875 and in European
Patent Specification No. 0016566 to incorporate a locking
mechanism in a pressure responsive piston assembly of the
actuator to lock the piston to an output member. The
locking mechanism is releasable by mechanical means passing
through non-pressurised end plate of the actuator and such
release therefore removes the compressive force of the power
spring from the actuator output member.In the case of an actuator which applies tension to its
output member especially where the actuator employs a
diaphragm is is not possible to provide access to such a
mechani
