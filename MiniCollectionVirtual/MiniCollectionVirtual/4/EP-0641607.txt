<ABSTRACT>
An aggregate material processing plant (1) has an input 
hopper (5) communicating with a screen box (8) which 

provides three material separations. The finest material 
is delivered through a longitudinal conveyor (11). The 

two other grades are delivered to hoppers (12) (13) which 
feed lateral conveyors (20). Each lateral conveyor (20) 

has a head section (22) which pivots relative to a tail 
section (21) about an axis which is perpendicular to the 

plane of the conveyor belt (27). In addition, part of the 
tail section (21) pivots about an axis which extends 

longitudinally so that whole conveyor can be mounted in 
the transport position within the lateral confines of the 

chassis and the height of other parts of the plant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to mobile, road-hauled aggregate
material processing plant such as screening plant,
crushing plant for quarries, or mining plant and as laid
out in the preamble of the accompanying claim 1. In this
specification, the term 'aggregate material" means
materials such as sand, crushed stones, bricks and any
construction material, loam, mined material such as coal,
or recyclable materials, timber, wood chips etc..In aggregate material processing plant generally,
processing capacity is heavily influenced by the ability
to quickly and effectively deliver the processed material
away from the plant. To achieve this, it is known to
provide lateral conveyors which extend transversely of the
plant, possibly in addition to longitudinal conveyors.
While the manner in which such lateral conveyors are
connected to the plant is relatively simple for the
operative position, where the processing plant is mobile
major problems arise in ensuring that the overall width
and height of the mobile plant is within certain
dimensions when carrying such conveyors during transport.
Another problem is ensuring safety, on-site, in movement
of the lateral conveyors to a position for transport of
the mobile plant. A still further problem is that of
providing for easy and safe maintenance or repair of the
lateral conveyors on-site or at a workshop.In British Patent Specification No. GB-2223963 (J.
McDonald) an arrangement is described whereby conveyors
including a lateral conveyor are separated from the mobile
plant and are then lifted by a loader onto upper support
brackets mounted above the plant. These brackets
significantly increase the height of the plant. Further,
carrying separated conveyor sections on such brackets may 
be a safety hazard. It is a time-consuming and awkward
exercise to separate the conveyor sections, mount them on
a loader and lift them onto the brackets.PCT Patent Specification No. WO 85/03652 (Powerscreen Int.
Ltd.) describes a mobile screening apparatus in which
there is a pair of opposed lateral conveyors extending on
opposite sides of the apparatus. The conveyors are
mounted on pivots which allow them to be pivoted from a
laterally-extending operative position at 24° to horizontal
to a transport position extending longitudinally at 10°-12°
to the horizontal. Because the plant must accommodate
the conveyors in the transport position in this manner, it
must be of sufficient length to avoid a situation where
they project longitudinally beyond the plant. Another
problem is that plant
