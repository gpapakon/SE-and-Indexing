<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for fixing a toilet lid to a toilet bowl in such a way that said lid can be removed and refitted easily, rapidly and frequently, thereby simplifying the operations of cleaning and disinfecting. The device for fixing a toilet lid is made up of at least one seat (21) attached by at least one hinge (3) to each fixing hole (14) of the bowl (1) so that it can be removed and refitted quickly and without tools, and it consists of two coaxial parts, of which one, a female part (4), is made fast to the bowl and has a central well (42) into which the other or male part (5) integral with the hinge of the lid is inserted within the female part (4), and of means which keep the male part (5) in an effectively stable position in the female part (4), the device being characterised in that the means ensuring the effectively stable position consist of at least one shoulder (9) on the male part (5) pushing against one or more resilient parts integral with the female part (4).
