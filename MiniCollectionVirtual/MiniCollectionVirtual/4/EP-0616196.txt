<ABSTRACT>
A fibre optic gyroscope sensing coil (24) having two parts 
(50a, 50b) one wound clockwise and the other wound 

counter-clockwise from a central point (52) on a spool 
(60) towards ends (54), (56) thereof and back towards the 

centre (52) before crossing over each other and being 
wound out and back a plurality of times. Such an 

arrangement has the advantage of eliminating the 
temperature sensitivity of such coils (24) and reducing 

microbending of the fibres thereby producing a more 
accurate coil for a fibre optic gyroscope.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fibre optic 
gyroscope sensing coil and to a method of manufacture 
thereof. More particularly, this invention pertains to 
improved fibre optic sensing coils and a method for their 
formation. Fibre optic gyroscopes comprise an interferometer 
which includes a light source, beam splitter and detector, 
and a fibre optic sensing coil. Light from the light 
source is split by the beam splitter and applied to the 
ends of the sensing coil. The interferometer and 
associated electronics process the phase relationship 
between the two interfering, counter-propagating beams of 
light that emerge from opposite ends of the coil. The 
difference between the phase shifts experienced by the two 
beams provides a measure of the rate of rotation of the 
platform to which the instrument is fixed. One of the problems associated with presently known 
fibre optic gyroscope sensing coils is their temperature 
sensitivity. It is therefore common practice to wind 
fibre onto a coil such that the fibre is laid up in 
alternate layers, supplied from alternate windings of 
fibre. Such an arrangement is illustrated in Figure 1 and 
helps to reduce the effect of any radial temperature 
difference experienced by clockwise and counter-clockwise 
light beams. Any change in the experienced path length 
will change the time it takes for the light to travel 
around the coil and will have an adverse effect on the  
 
performance of a gyro. The above mentioned arrangement 
whilst reducing the temperature sensitivity is unable to 
average out temperature effects on fibre lengths shorter 
than the double layer as this fibre comes from only one of 
the two spools. In addition to the above, any axial 
temperature variation  dT / dx along the axis X of the sensing 
coil will also have a significant effect on the 
performance of the gyro as such temperature variations 
cannot be compensated for. From Figure 1 it will be appreciated that the fibre 
at the end of each layer will have to undergo a double 
layer jump to the next layer before it is again wound 
around the coil. Such jumping can result in microbending 
with the associated, and undesirable, consequence of 
polarisation cross coupling. Such cross coupling is known 
to be one of the key error sources of the gyro. US 4,856,900 discloses a quadrupole-wound sensing 
coil for a fibre optic gyroscope in which alternate double 
layers of fibre are wound onto a coil and microbends are 
reduced by winding the fibre through three concentric 
turns adjacent

<CLAIMS>
A fibre optic coil wound from a pair of supplies 
characterised by comprising:
 
   a winding of fibre (50) on a spool, said fibre (50) 

extending in opposite directions from a mid point (52) on 
said spool one going clockwise and the other counter 

clockwise towards ends of said spool and back to the 
centre thereof to form a double layer, said fibres being 

crossed at the centre (52) of the spool and being wound 
in opposite directions to each other at least once again, 

one going clockwise and other counter-clockwise (50a, 50b) 
towards said ends and back to the centre of the spool to 

form at least one further double layer. 
A fibre optic coil according to claim 1, including a 
further single layer (50c) of fibre forming the outermost 

layer of said coil (24) 
A method of winding an optical fibre from first and 
second supplies onto a sensor spool characterised by the 

steps of: 

(a) locating a point (52) on said fibre (50) 
intermediate the ends thereof; then 
(b) positioning said point (52) of said fibre at a 
mid point on said spool; then 
(c) winding said fibre (50) onto said spool by 
winding the fibre from each supply in opposite directions 

with one going clockwise and the other counter-clockwise 
towards ends of said spool and back to the centre thereof, 

thereby to form a first double layer (50a, 50b); then  
 
(d) crossing over said supplies; then 
(e) repeating step c and d above to give an even 
number of double layers, thereby to produce a sensor coil 

(24) for a fibre optic gyroscope. 
A method of winding as claimed in claim 3 in which 
the point (52) on said fibre intermediate the ends thereof 

is the mid point thereof. 
A method of winding as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4, 
in which each supply is a spool of fibre (50). 
A method of winding as claimed in any one of claims 4 
to 6, including the step of winding a single layer (50c) 

of fibre as the outermost layer of the coil (24).
