<ABSTRACT>
An attachment assembly (2) for connecting a pressure vessel to 
another object, but preferably for connecting rocket motors to 

one another, including several successive layers, which are 
arranged in the following order: first, a reinforcement section (41) 

on an outer casing (9) of a first pressure vessel; second, a layer of 
resilient shear ply material (37) adhered to the outermost surface of 

the reinforcement section; third, a saddle (3) positioned over the 
shear ply; fourth, an overwrap (7) which secures the saddle to the 

shear ply; fifth, a plurality of lugs (4,8) which are secured to the 
saddle; sixth, a connecting means attached to one of the lugs;

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the field of fasteners, 
and is especially applicable to fastening a pressure vessel to 
another object, especially another pressure vessel. The 
invention particularly pertains to means for fastening two rocket 
motors or engines to one another, for example a booster rocket 
motor to a main rocket motor. Multi-engine rocket-powered aircraft are well known. More 
than one rocket engine in a single aircraft (or spacecraft) can 
be utilized to extend the range, speed or payload of the craft. 
The addition of separate rockets can also be used to produce 
added directional control or special maneuverability, spin, etc., 
to the craft. Most commonly, one or more booster rocket engines 
are employed along side a main rocket engine, in order to 
increase the thrust. U.S. Patent 3,070,329 (HASBROUCK) relates to directional 
control for rockets. HASBROUCK utilizes a plurality of 
independent movable steering rockets which are fastened along 
side the main rocket engine, and which exert a steering thrust at 
an acute angle to the line of thrust of the main propulsive 
nozzle. The steering rockets are affixed to the main rocket with 
gimbal joints, as well as a supporting ring which is lugged. Two 
struts, comprising ball and socket joints on the respective ends 
thereof, are affixed to the steering rocket and the main rocket. 
The purpose of the steering rockets is to provide a means for 
steering the main rocket in the desired direction, and this is 
why the gimbal joint is utilized in fastening the steering rocket 
to the main rocket. U.S. Patent 3,532,304 (PYPTIUK) relates to rocket powered 
space vehicles in which four rocket motors are equally spaced 
around the roll axis of the vehicle, universally mounted on a  
 
common frame. Each motor is separately mounted to a tubular 
thrust ring by means of a coupling. The coupling may be a ball 
and socket joint, and the coupling permits the motor to pivot 
relative to the thrust ring. The arms which connect the rocket 
nozzles to the non-pivoting portion of the machine may also be 
fitted with ball and socket joints. U.S. Patent 4,892,435, U.S. Patent 4,904,109, and U.S. 
Patent 4,909,659, all in the name of Robert ANDERSON, relate to 
interlocking structural members employing transverse locking 
wedges or locking means. ANDERSON fastens composite materials 
together that comprise polymers having reinforcing fibers 
therein. All three of these patents are particularly directed at 
aircraft wing skins which are attached to a
