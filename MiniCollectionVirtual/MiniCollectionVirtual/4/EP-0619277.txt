<ABSTRACT>
A cement admixture which when added to a cement 
composition, such as cement mortar or concrete inhibits 

slump-loss of the cement composition and improve its 
workability and applicability. The admixture is composed 

of copolymers from an alkenyl ether, a polyalkenyl ether 
and maleic anhydride.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cement admixture
composition. More particularly, it relates to an
admixture composition for hydraulic cement compositions
such as mortar and concrete to prevent time wise decrease
in their flowability (herein called as "slump loss")
while drastically improving the compositions workability
and applicability over sustained periods of time.Slump loss is a major problem in the concrete
industry. It is highly desired to have a cement additive
which will impart high degree of flowability over an
extended period of time while not imparting any
significant set retardation to the cement composition.
Various proposals have been made to solve this problem
but, such proposals have not provided a combination of
the desired characteristics or only provide the desired
characteristics in low degrees.Slump-loss is the biggest problem in concrete
industry, and various methods have been tried by many
investigators to solve this problem, but satisfactory
solution has not been found so far. Therefore, there is
a strong desire to find an early solution to this
problem.It is generally known, for example, that the
copolymers of alkenyl ethers and maleic anhydride and the
derivatives thereof can be employed as cement additives
to improve slump loss [Japanese Patent Publication
(Kokai) Nos. 63-285140(1988) and 2-163108(1990)].
However, copolymers of this class which have been
previously used, exhibit only small improvement in slump
loss or caused excessive set retardation to the treated
cement composition. It has now been found that certain copolymer
compositions described below having a specified molecular
structure have remarkable effectiveness for the
prevention of slump loss without causing significant set
retardation.The present invention is directed to a cement
admixture composition which requires the use of certain
alkenyl ether/polyalkenyl ether/maleic anhydride
copolymers.The specific cement admixture compositions of this
invention are alkenyl ether/polyalkenyl ether/maleic
anhydride copolymer and mixtures thereof, as fully
described below. They have been unexpectedly found to
impart a high degree of slump loss over a sustained
period of time, dramatically improving workability and
applicability while not imparting any significant set
retardation to the treated composition.The present invention is directed to a cement
admixture which has been unexpectedly found to provide a
high flowability to cement compositions such as concrete
and cement mortar, provide the high flowability over an
