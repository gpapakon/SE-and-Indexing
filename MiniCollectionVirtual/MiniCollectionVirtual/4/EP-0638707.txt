<ABSTRACT>
[OBJECT]
An engine brake device, which serves during engine braking to 
ensure a braking force by opening an exhaust valve of a cylinder near a 

top dead center in a compression stroke to discharge the compressed air, 
is utilized to provide an internal combustion engine which can attain 

exhaust gas recirculation. 
[CONSTRUCTION]
In an internal combustion engine, in addition to an engine-braking 
master piston 2a for a cylinder actuated by a rocker arm 19a which in 

turn is actuated by a push rod 1a of another cylinder, an exhaust-gas-recirculation 
mater piston 2b is provided which is actuated by a rocker 

arm 19b which in turn is actuated by a push rod 1b of the another 
cylinder to open an exhaust valve 8 in a suction stroke, thereby 

producing hydraulic pressure in the oil having been supplied to an oil 
passage 5. Further provided is an oil passage selector valve 11 for 

selectively switching over the hydraulic pressures produced by the 
engine-braking and exhaust-gas-recirculation master piston 2a to the oil 

passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine in 
which a compression engine brake device, which serves during engine 
braking to ensure a braking force by opening an exhaust valve of a 
cylinder near a top dead center in a compression stroke to discharge the 
compressed air, is utilized for exhaust gas recirculation.  
 In an internal combustion engine with an engine brake device as 
shown in Fig. 8 (see e.g. US-A-4 936 273), during engine braking with an exhaust brake valve 10 
being closed, a master piston 2 for a cylinder 7 is actuated by a rocker 
arm 19 which in turn is actuated by a push rod 1 of another cylinder 
(not shown) to pressurize an oil having been supplied to an oil passage 
5 from a rocker shaft bracket through solenoid and control valves 3 and 
4. Due to the hydraulic pressure thus produced, an exhaust valve 8 of 
the cylinder 7 near a top dead center is opened via a slave piston 6 to 
discharge the compressed air through an exhaust port 9. As a result, 
force for pushing down the piston is prevented from generating and a 
braking force obtained in the compression stroke is effectively utilized 
with no loss. In in-line 6-cylindered engines, three oil passages 5 are branched 
off from a single oil passage provided with a solenoid valve 3, a 
control valve 4 being disposed in each of the oil passages 5. This 
allows the volume of each oil passage 5 to be reduced and enhances 
responsiveness of the slave piston 6. An internal combustion engine having a conventional engine brake 
device described above may be effective for engine braking, but cannot 
attain recirculation of exhaust gases, failing to make improvement on 
the problems of NOX and of white smoke at engine starting. Particularly 
in a turbo-intercooled engine, exhaust gas recirculation is difficult to 
carry out. It is an object of the present invention to provide an internal 
combustion engine which can solve the above problems. To attain the above object, the present invention is directed to an 
internal combustion engine wherein during engine braking, a master 
piston for a cylinder is actuated by a rocker arm which in turn is 
actuated by a push rod of another cylinder to pressurize an oil having 
been supplied to an oil passage, an exhaust valve of the one cylinder 
near a top dead center in a compression stroke being opened through a 
slave piston by the hydraulic pressure thus produced to discharge the 
compressed air through an exhaust port, characterized in that 
in addition to said engine-braking
