<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for forming the primary web of a mineral fibre mat onto a moving, pervious base by transporting fibres onto the base by means of a stream of air or a corresponding means. In accordance with the invention, the stream of air is adjusted to minimise the pressure difference over the forming base. The invention also relates to an apparatus for the purpose of implementing the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for forming the primary 
web of a mineral fibre mat from fibres manufactured 
from mineral melt by using centrifugal force, particularly 
by means of several slinger wheels linked in 
series; i.e. using what may be called the cascade method, 
as defined in claims 1 and 6 respectively. In accordance with the principle of manufacturing mineral 
fibre by using centrifugal force, the molten mineral 
matter is led onto the periphery of a spinning or slinger 
wheel in strip form, from which the fibre embryos are 
drawn outwards by the centrifugal force produced by the 
great rotational velocity. A high-velocity medium flow is 
directed to pass close to the disc periphery, which medium 
flow finishes the fiber-formation and transports the 
fibres in the direction of the rotational axis of the 
wheel away from the fibre formation area. In cascade 
fiberization more than one slinger wheel is used, 
generally 2-4 wheels, in which case the molten material 
is led onto the first slinger wheel, from there to the 
second wheel rotating in the opposite direction, then to 
the third, and so on. At each wheel, with the possible 
exception of the first one, part of the molten material 
attaches itself in strip form onto the periphery of the 
wheel, and due to the centrifugal force and the passing 
medium flow forms fibres so that at the last wheel the 
entire molten material is fiberized. The medium flow directs the fibres formed in the fiberization 
device into a wool chamber, at the opposite end 
of which the fibres are collected onto a wire or other 
corresponding air pervious forming-base conveyed in a 
direction essentially perpendicular to the medium flow 
direction and onto which the fibres form a thin mat, a 
primary web. The complete mineral wool blanket is formed  
 
by layering a required number of the primary webs one on 
top of the other. The dispersion of air/fibres obtained from the fiberization 
device is essentially cylindrical in shape and in 
addition generally narrower than the desired primary web. 
This is why it has been difficult to collect onto forming 
bases webs that are of uniform quality right up to 
their edges. From the standpoint of proper web formation 
it is considered essential that the transportation of the 
fibres to the forming-base and their settling down on it 
is to be achieved by means of a suction force acting 
through the base. In other words, underpressure is maintained 
on the evacuation side of the forming-base with 
respect

<CLAIMS>
A method for forming a primary web of a mineral fibre 
mat from fibres formed of molten mineral matter (7) by 

means of centrifugal force on slinger wheels (6, 6', 6'', 
6''') in a fiberization device and transported as a fiber 

cloud from the fiberization device by gas medium streams 
(1, 2, 3, 4), the primary web being formed onto a wire 

(8) or a corresponding pervious forming base in motion in 
front of the fiberization device, 
characterized
 in that 
the fiber cloud is blown from the fiberization device 

onto the forming base (8) under shaping guidance of the 
gas medium streams (1, 2, 3, 4), and that a state in 

which there is essentially no pressure difference through 
the forming base (8), but the pressure on the evacuation 

side is slightly lower than that on the formation side 
so, that the mat formed can remain on the forming base 

(8), is achieved and maintained on the web forming area. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised
 in that 
at least three gas medium streams (1, 2, 3), essentially 

unidirectional in terms of their main direction of flow, 
are introduced into the fiberization device, the said 

streams being independently adjustable and/or controllable 
in terms of their direction, velocity and/or 

volume flow, the velocities of the said streams being inversely 
proportional to the distance from the slinger 

wheels (6, 6', 6'', 6''') in the direction of the centrifugal 
force. 
A method as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised
 in that 
at least one (4) of the gas medium streams is led through 

a slinger wheel (6, 6', 6'', 6'''). 
A method as claimed in claims 2 or 3,

are led in channels. 
An apparatus for implementing the method according to 
claim 1, the apparatus consisting of at least one driven 

slinger wheel (6 - 6''') for the purpose of receiving 
molten mineral mass (7) and initiate the fiber formation,

tangentially with respect to the slinger wheel and 

surrounding the slinger wheel in an arc-like manner at a 
small distance from the periphery or part of the 

periphery, transportation gas medium nozzles (2) located 
radially with respect to the slinger wheel outside the 

fiberization gas medium orifice and surrounding the 
fiberization gas medium orifice in an arc-like manner, a 

forming base (8) located essentially in front of the slinger 
wheel (6) or wheels (6', 6'', 6''') in a plane essentially 

parallel with the rotation plane of the said 
wheel(s), devices (9) for evacuating the gas medium

characterized
 by means for 
regulating and/or controlling the gas medium streams 

(1,2,3,4), and by control devices for maintaining a predetermined 
pressure difference over the forming wire (8)

and the forming area (8).
