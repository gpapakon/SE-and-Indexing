<CLAIMS>
Installation (1) for manufacturing chocolate
bars or similar products, having casting plates (18),

which have cavities for receiving the product to be
made into bars, and a conveying section (21, 21', 22),

the casting plates being movable along the conveying
section (21, 21', 22), and the conveying section being

bounded by parallel guides (16, 17), characterized in
that the casting plates (18) are freely supported by

the lateral ends on the parallel guides (16, 17), in
that at least one worm (20) is provided between the

parallel guides as a driving means, and in that
projections (31, 32) protrude from the casting plates

(18), which projections are operatively connected to
the threads of the worm (20).
Installation for manufacturing bars according
to Patent Claim 1, characterized in that a drive shaft

(19) of the worm (20) is connected to a device for
controlled rotational movement, and the rotational

movement of the shaft (19) can be carried out in both
directions (f).
Installation for manufacturing bars according
to Patent Claim 1, characterized in that the worm (20)

for advancing the casting plates (18) along the drive
shaft (19) is formed by separate bodies, and each body,

which forms a drive worm (20), is fastened to the drive
shaft (19) at only one end (100) of the drive worm

(20). 
Installation for manufacturing bars according
to Patent Claim 1, characterized in that retaining

stops (26) are provided at the end of the parallel
guides (16, 17) for advancing the casting plates (18),

which retaining stops, when actuated, emit control
signals which are fed to a device, comprising a piston-cylinder

unit (27), for the transverse advance of the
plates (18).
Installation for manufacturing bars according
to Patent Claim 1, characterized in that in the turning

device (9) of the casting plates (18), the advancing
worm (20a) is held by a shaft (19a) whose ends are

designed such that they can be connected to, and
detached from, the end pieces of the drive shafts (19)

lying next to one another, and in that the worm (20a)
is arranged pivotably on a transverse rod (36) and the

sections of the worm (20a) of the pivoting device (9)
are covered at their opposite sides by plates (39, 40)

which form chambers to hold the casting plates (18).
Installation for manufacturing bars according
to Patent Claim 1, characterized in that the conveying

worm (20) is arranged in a horizontal position.
Installation for manufacturing bars according
to Patent Claim 1, characterized in that the conveying

worm (20) is arranged in a vertical position.
Installation for manufacturing bars according
to Patent Claim 1, characterized in that the drive

shaft (19) and the conveying worm (20) are protected by
a cover (43, 44) formed by covering plates, and the

upper side of this cover bounds a slot (45), and the
protruding projections (31, 32) jut through the slot of

the casting plate (18).
Casting plate for an installation for
manufacturing bars according to Patent Claim 1,

characterized in that the projections (31, 32, 27a,
27b) protrude from the body of the casting plate (18).
Casting plate according to Patent Claim 8,
characterized in that the projections (31, 32) are

arranged in the centre of the casting plate (18) and in 
the direction of the relatively large longitudinal

extent of the casting plate (18).
Casting plate according to Patent Claim 8,
characterized in that the projections (27a, 27b) are

arranged in the centre of the casting plate (18) and on
the narrow sides of the plate.
Casting plate according to Patent Claim 10,
characterized in that the projections (2
7a, 27b), which
protrude from the narrow side of the casting plates

(18), are designed as half-bodies.
Casting plate according to Patent Claim 8,
characterized in that step-shaped recesses (51, 52) are

provided on the narrow side of the casting plate (18),
which recesses form receptacles for ribs (54, 55) which

protrude from the lower side of the casting plate, and
in that the ribs (54, 55) form guide means which cover,

and engage around, the outside of the guides (16, 17).
