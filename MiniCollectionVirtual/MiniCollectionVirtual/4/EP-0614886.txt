<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compound which 
can pass through blood-brain barrier (BBB) carrying a 
drug and release the drug while being retained in brain, 
and to its use. Cerebral tissue or cells are separated from blood by 
very tightly combined cerebral capillary vessels (blood-brain 
barrier), that is, brain is protected by the strict 
limitation of the interchange of materials through the 
blood-brain barrier. Therefore, a drug administered 
systemically sometimes cannot successfully be delivered 
to brain being impeded by BBB. In general, the permeability of materials through 
BBB is correlated with the lipophilicity of the 
materials. Thus, some lipophilic prodrugs have been 
synthesized for the purpose of facilitation of delivery 
to brain of a drug which is hard to permeate through BBB. 
On the other hand, brain also possesses a mechanism for 
active excretion of waste materials and drugs back to the 
periphery. Therefore, it is considered that the 
conventional prodrugs which only facilitate their 
distribution to brain by mainly increase in the 
lipophilicity have limitations in maintaining the 
concentration and efficacy of the drug (Rahimy, M.H., et 
al., Pharm. Res., 10 (1990) 1061-1067). In other words, 
it is required to provide a means to enhance the 
transport of the drug across BBB and to prolong the 
residence in brain of the drug in order to maintain its 
efficacy following intravenous administration of a drug. In order to solve the problem, Bodor (Florida 
University) has proposed a dihydropyridine prodrug which 
utilizes the NAD+-NADH redox system (Bodor, N., et al., 
Science, 214 (1981) 1370-1372). The lipophilic  
 
derivative, when incorporated into cells, is oxidized 
mainly by the NAD+ oxidation system into a pyridinium 
cation and retained in brain due to the decrease of its 
permeability through biological membrane. This method is 
believed an excellent system for delivering drugs to 
brain, since the pyridinium cation carrying the drug 
releases it in a sustained manner. Bodor and his co-workers 
have already demonstrated the excellency of the 
method in more than twenty compounds (drugs). However, 
the dihydropyridine derivative is easily oxidized perse 
and thus is likely to lead to the deterioration of the 
quality for example by the air oxidation after its 
synthesis. The present inventors have examined further 
possibilities for obtaining the compounds which can pass 
through BBB and deliver a drug into brain. As a result, 
we have found that certain kinds of
