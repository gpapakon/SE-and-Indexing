<ABSTRACT>
A shoulder joint endoprosthesis has a glenoid cavity (12) associated to the shoulder blade (18), a humeral cavity (14) which may be secured to the arm bone (30) by an intramedullary prosthetic dowel (28), and a joint ball (16) freely movably arranged between the glenoid cavity (12) and the humeral cavity (14).

Shoulder endoprosthesis, comprising a glenoid 
socket (12) which is assigned to the scapula (18, a 

humeral socket (14), which can be fastened to the humerus 
(30) via an intramedullary prosthesis stem (28), and a 

ball (16) which is not fixed by the glenoid socket (12) 
and the humeral socket (14) and is arranged so as to move 

freely between the sockets (12, 14). 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the glenoid socket (12) can be 

fixed to the scapula (18) via a backward part (20). 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the glenoid socket (12) is made of 

polyethylene or similar sliding-bearing material, which 
is applied to the backward part (20) of the glenoid 

socket (12). 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to Claim 2 
and/or 3, characterized in that the backward part (20) is 

made of metal or the like, in particular of titanium or 
a titanium alloy. 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the backward part 

(20) is designed as porous or the like for incorporation 
with the bone of the scapula (18), in particular with a 

pore diameter of greater than and/or equal to 100 µm. 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the glenoid socket 

(12) is designed substantially in the shape of a shell 
and/or, in plan view, of a pear, the upper part (24) of 

the glenoid socket (12) having a smaller aperture radius  
 

than the lower part (26) of the glenoid socket (12). 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the glenoid socket 

(12) has an overhang or the like. 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the humeral socket 

(14) is made of polyethylene or similar sliding-bearing 
material, which is applied to the prosthesis stem (28). 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the prosthesis stem 

(28) is made of metal or the like, in particular of 
titanium or a titanium alloy.
 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the prosthesis stem 

(28) is capable of intramedullary fixing with a plateau 
angle α with respect to the prosthesis stem axis of about 

50° to 60°. 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the humeral socket 

(14) has a large internal radius, preferably matched to 
the ball (16). 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 1 to 11, characterized in that the humeral socket 

(14) has a caudal projection (36), or one directed 
towards the lower end of the body, or the like. 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the ball (16) is 

made of metal or the like. 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 1 to 13, characterized in that the ball (16) is 

designed as a hollow ball. 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 1 to 14, characterized in that the size of the 

ball (16) is variable as a function of the respective 
load on the joint and the internal volume of the rotator 

cuff. 
Shoulder endoprosthesis according to one of 
Claims 2 to 15, characterized in that the glenoid socket 

(12) can be connected to the backward part (20) via a  
 

latch, snap-in or similar device (62).
