<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided which comprises using a 
catalyst comprises a rare earth element supported on an 

inorganic heat-resisting carrier, when a monoethanolamine 
is selectively prepared by reacting an alkylene oxide 

with ammonia in a liquid phase. This catalyst has excellent 
monoalkanolamine selectivity and heat resistance; 

and therefore, even when the ratio of ammonia to the 
alkylene oxide is lower compared with cases where other 

catalysts are used, an equal or more amount of the monoalkanolamine 
can be formed, and thus the recovery cost of 

the unreacted ammonia is reduced. Further, since the 
total amount of the feed raw materials is reduced, apparatuses 

for the reaction system and recovery system can 
be made smaller, and thus the cost of equipment is 

reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in preparation of an
alkanolamine by amination of an alkylene oxide with
ammonia using a catalyst carrying a rare earth element,
to a process to prepare a monoalkanolamine selectively
and with good productivity and with lowered formation of
compounds in which two moles or more of the alkylene
oxide are bound (particularly, compounds in which 3 moles
or more thereof are bound). The process of this invention
is particularly useful in industrial preparation of
ethanolamines by amination of ethylene oxide with
ammonia. This invention also relates to the catalyst and
a process for preparation of the catalyst.As a process of preparing an alkanolamine by
amination of an alkylene oxide with ammonia is industrially
carried out a process to prepare an ethanolamine
by reacting ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia (ammonia
concentration : 20-40% by weight). Diethanolamine and
triethanolamine are produced as by-products other than
monoethanolamine according to this process, but the
demand for triethanolamine among them is now decreased,
and therefore it is needed to suppress the formation of
triethanolamine. Thus, reaction is, usually, carried out
with largely excess ammonia such that the mole ratio of
ammonia to ethylene oxide is on the order of 3 to 5, but
nevertheless the selectivity of triethanolamine is 10 to
20% by weight or more and the selectivity of monoethanolamine
is 50% by weight % or less.On the other hand, in a system of absence of
water an alkylene oxide and ammonia scarcely react.
Thus, in such reaction, the presence of a catalyst is
requisite, and homogeneous catalysts are proposed such
as, for example, organic acids, inorganic acids and
ammonium salts (Swedish Patent No. 158,167). However, 
these homogeneous catalysts have their problem in separation
of the catalyst, and their performance is not sufficient,
either. As an attempt to immobilize such a homogeneous
catalyst is proposed an ion exchanger resin
comprising a resin having immobilized therein sulfonic
acid groups (Japanese Patent Publication No. 47728/1974).
This catalyst has comparatively good activity and selectivity
and is industrially used. However, the ion exchange
resin has a problem that its maximum use temperature
is low. Usable maximum temperature for usually
available ion exchange resins is rather as low as on the
order of 120°C (see "Ion-Kokan-Riron to Oyo heno Tebiki"
(Ion Exchange-Introduction on Theory and Practice), co-translated
by Rokuro KURODA and Masami SHIBUKAWA, published
