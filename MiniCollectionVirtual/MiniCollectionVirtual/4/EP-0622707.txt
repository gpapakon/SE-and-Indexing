<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus which transfers a developed image from a photoconductive surface 
(10) to a copy sheet includes a corona generating device (46) arranged to charge the copy sheet 

for establishing a transfer field that is effective to attract the developed image from the 
photoconductive surface to the copy sheet. The apparatus also includes a blade (45) which is 

moved from a non-operative position spaced from the copy sheet, to an operative position, in 
contact therewith, in which the blade presses the copy sheet into contact with at least the 

developed image on the photoconductive surface to substantially eliminate any spaces 
between the copy sheet and the developed image during transfer of the developed image 

from the photoconductive surface to the copy sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electrophotographic printing machines,
and more specifically concerns an apparatus for assisting the transfer of a developed image
from a photoconductive imaging surface to a copy sheet.In a typical electrophotographic copying process, a photoconductive member is
charged to a substantially uniform potential so as to sensitize the surface thereof. The charged
portion of the photoconductive member is exposed to a light image of an original document
being reproduced. Exposure of the charged photoconductive member selectively dissipates the
charge thereon in the irradiated areas. This process records an electrostatic latent image on the
photoconductive member corresponding to the informational areas contained within the
original document. After the electrostatic latent image is recorded on the photoconductive
member, the latent image is developed by bringing a developer material into contact
therewith. Generally, the developer material is made from toner particles adhering
triboelectrically to carrier granules. The toner particles are attracted from the carrier granules
to the latent image forming a toner powder image on the photoconductive member. The
toner powder image is then transferred from the photoconductive member to a copy substrate
such as a sheet of paper. Thereafter, heat or some other treatment is applied to the toner
particles to permanently affix the powder image to the copy substrate.The electrophotographic printing process described above is well known and is
commonly used for light lens copying of an original document. Analogous processes also exist
in other electrostatographic printing applications such as, for example, digital printing where
the latent image is produced by a modulated laser beam, or ionographic printing and
reproduction, where charge is deposited on a charge retentive surface in response to
electronically generated or stored images.The process of transferring charged toner particles from an image bearing member
such as the photoconductive member to an image support substrate such as the copy sheet is
enabled by overcoming adhesive forces holding the toner particles to the image bearing
member. In general, transfer of developed toner images in electrostatographic applications
has been accomplished via electrostatic induction using a corona generating device, wherein
the image support substrate is placed in direct contact with the developed toner image on the
photoconductive surface while the reverse side of the image support
