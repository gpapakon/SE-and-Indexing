<ABSTRACT>
A pipe laying machine comprises a vehicle carrying a trench excavator followed by a pipe laying box (10) running in the trench. Pipe lengths are stored in the pipe laying box one above another and the lowermost pipe length is periodically released by movement of bars (48, 50) into the bottom of the pipe laying box and is pressed by a ram (6) into the mouth of the last laid pipe length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to excavating and pipe
laying machines of the kind which comprise a vehicle
carrying excavating means which is used to dig a trench
into which individual lengths of pipe are laid, joins
between the pipe lengths being made by forcing the latest
laid pipe length into the mouth of the previously laid pipe
length.Machines of this type are described in German
Specification DE 3914736. In practice when using machines
of this type at present, individual pipe lengths are
lowered by crane into the trench through a pipe box carried
by the vehicle immediately behind the excavating means.
The pipe box extends down to the bottom of the trench and
provides an enclosure within which the pipe laying activity
can be conducted without risk of the walls of the trench
falling in in this zone. One or more hydraulic rams acting
through cables are used to push the latest laid pipe length
into the mouth of the preceding one to form a joint, the
pipe lengths exiting from the pipe box through an aperture
at the lower rear of the box.Whilst machines of this type are able to lay pipe
lengths at an increased rate in comparison to previous
systems the full potential of machines of this kind is not
yet being realised. In particular, the operation of
lowering individual pipe lengths through the pipe box to
the bottom of the trench for laying necessitates the
halting of the excavating machine for the loading of each
individual pipe length. Also, lowering each pipe length
down the entire depth of the pipe box entails a risk of
damage to the pipe length due to collisions between the
pipe length and the pipe box walls.In SU-A-1 735 506 (Solomonov et al) there is disclosed
a pipe laying machine comprising a vehicle with excavating
means for excavating a trench, a pipe laying box behind the 
excavating means which in use is positioned in the
excavated trench, and means in the pipe laying box for
holding a supply of lengths of pipe and for releasing the
lengths one by one for laying. The pipe laying box is open
bottomed, so that the bottom pipe length in the box rests
on a layer of sand which has been put in the bottom of the
trench. A length of pipe in the supply of lengths of pipe
is released by retractable cut-offs which project into the
pipe laying box, and the released pipe length is deposited
on top of a pipe length already laying on the bottom of the
trench. As the pipe laying machine moves forward, the
released pipe length is dragged across the top of the
bottom pipe length on the trench floor, until it

being movable between a first position in which it

protrudes into said path of passage to catch the lower-most
pipe length in said ready to release position and a second

position in which it is retracted from said path of
passage, and an upper one (48) of said pair of pipe support

members in the or each pair being moveable in synchrony
with said first one between a first position in which it is

retracted from said path of passage and a second position
in which it protrudes into said path of passage above said

ready to release position to catch the next pipe length in
said supply.
A machine as claimed in claim 3, wherein the or each
pair of pipe support members (48, 50) is carried for

pivotal movement about a respective pivot axis, the pivot
axis lying on one side of said path of passage or the axes
