<ABSTRACT>
An automotive wheelhouse sealing strip (22) for 
providing a secondary seal to prevent infiltration and 

accumulation of dirt and mud in the gap between a rear 
door (12) and a rear door opening in the vicinity of the 

wheelhouse (14) of a four-door sedan vehicle includes a 
fully moulded weather sealing member (22) which is formed 

to accurately conform to the shape of the portion of the 
door opening to which the weather sealing member is to be 

attached, thereby providing an aesthetically pleasing 
tight engagement between the vehicle body and the sealing 

member. The sealing strip generally includes a weather 
sealing lip (24) having a sealing surface (30) which 

sealingly abuts an inner peripheral surface of a vehicle 
rear door (12) when the rear door is in the closed 

position, and a base portion (26) which is adapted to be 
attached to a vehicle body part (32) at a peripheral 

surface generally defining the rear door opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to seals for automotive 
vehicles, and more particularly to seals for conforming to 
supporting structure of vehicle door openings having 
curved, bent or other complicated shapes, and to the 
application of such seals adjacent a wheel housing region. For four-door sedan vehicles which generally 
have the rear wheels very close to the rear doors, it has 
been found that when driving on wet, dirty and muddy 
roads, dirt and mud will typically accumulate between the 
door and door opening outboard from the primary door seal 
in the area immediately forward of the rear wheelhouse. 
In some extreme cases the primary seal has been found to 
be ineffective at preventing water and dirt thrown by the 
rear wheel at the area between the door and door opening 
from entering the passenger compartment of the vehicle. 
In either case, unsightly accumulations of dirt and mud 
are deposited between the wheelhouse and the door, requiring 
additional effort during cleaning and presenting a 
risk to rear seat passengers of soiling clothing during 
entrance into, or egress from the vehicle. Moreover, 
because of the proximity of the door opening to the rear 
wheels of such vehicles, undesirable road noise levels are 
often encountered. In response to the problem of dirt and mud 
accumulating between the rear wheelhouse and the rear 
passenger door of four door sedans, and to reduce noise 
levels, automobile manufacturers have provided a secondary 
wheelhouse weather seal which is attached to the 
wheelhouse sheet metal and resides in the gap between the 
door opening and the door, outboard from the primary door 
seal. Conventional wheelhouse seals are extruded elastomeric 
materials which have a constant transverse cross  
 
sectional size and shape. There are problems in 
achieving an aesthetically pleasing, tight fit capable of 
accurately tracking the shape of the gap between the door 
and the door opening, especially when the door opening has 
a complicated non-linear or non-circular shape such as a 
door opening having offsets, indentations, sharp turns, or 
a variable radius of curvature. In order to facilitate a 
better fit of the extruded wheelhouse weather seals to the 
vehicle rear door opening, molded details, metal inserts, 
or both are generally utilized. Molded details are 
frequently used as transitional pieces between separate 
extruded weather sealing members to conceal gaps therebetween, 
especially when it is not possible, or is extremely 
difficult, to follow the shape of a

A wheelhouse weather sealing strip adapted to be 
attached to a portion of a vehicle rear door opening near 

the wheelhouse for sealing the gap between a vehicle rear 
door (12) and a vehicle rear door opening to reduce 

intrusion and accumulation of dirt at the vicinity of the 
rear wheelhouse outboard from a primary door seal (18), 

the sealing strip comprising a one-piece, fully moulded 
weather sealing member (22) which is pre-formed to 

accurately conform to the shape of the portion (32) of the 
door opening to which the weather sealing member (22) is 

to be attached. 
A wheelhouse weather sealing strip according to claim 
1 which includes a sealing lip portion (24) having a 

sealing surface (30) which sealingly abuts an inner 
peripheral surface of a vehicle rear door (12) when the 

rear door is in the closed position, and a base portion 
(26) which is adapted to be attached to a vehicle body 

part (32) at a peripheral surface generally defining the 
rear door opening. 
A wheelhouse weather sealing strip according to claim 
2, further including a transitional portion (28) which 

connects the sealing lip portion (24) to the base portion 
(26). 
A wheelhouse weather sealing strip of claim 2 or 
claim 3, wherein the sealing lip (24) when viewed along a 

transverse cross-section of the sealing strip has 
approximately a crescent shape. 
A wheelhouse weather sealing strip according to claim 
2, wherein the sealing lip (24') when viewed along a 

transverse cross-section of the sealing strip has 
approximately a crescent shape, and wherein the base 

portion (26') is directly attached to the inner concave 
side of the sealing lip (24') portion opposite the sealing 

surface (30'). 
A wheelhouse weather sealing strip according to any 
one of the preceding claims wherein the base portion (26) 

includes a plurality of spaced fastener holes (34) for 
mounting the sealing strip to a vehicle body part with 

fasteners (36). 
A wheelhouse weather sealing strip according to any 
one of the preceding claims which is moulded from an 

elastomeric material. 
A wheelhouse weather sealing strip according to claim 
7 which is moulded from an elastomeric thermoplastic 

material. 
A wheelhouse weather sealing strip according to claim 
 

7 which is moulded from a rubber material. 
A wheelhouse weather sealing strip according to any 
one of the preceding claims which is co-moulded from at 

least two different polymeric mouldable materials, 
provided that a sealing lip portion (24) thereof is formed 

of an elastomeric material.
