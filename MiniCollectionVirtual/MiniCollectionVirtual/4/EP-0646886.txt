<ABSTRACT>
In fingerprint pattern classification, radial scanning vectors 
are used. A space between two adjacent ridge lines including a core 

point is traced by radial scanning. Radial distribution of number 
of cross points from the core point is a clue to a fingerprint 

classification.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for automatic
fingerprint classification.There are two types of processing fingerprint images for
automatic fingerprint classification. In a first type of
processing, a fingerprint image is subdivided in a plural number of
subregions, and for each subregion, a ridge line direction is
quantized, a core point of the fingerprint image is determined from
quantized ridge line directions of subregions, and the fingerprint
is classified in accordance with the shape and the direction trend
of ridge line directions in an area near to the core point. This
type of processing is disclosed, for example, in
US-A-5,337,369.In a second type of processing, ridge lines of a fingerprint
are processed to produce a thin line in the center of each ridge
line. This type of processing is disclosed, for example, in
JP-A-153687/'88, wherein thinned ridge lines are
approximated by fragmental straight line segments. The fingerprint
is classified in accordance with direction distribution of these
straight line segments.In these two types of processing, there are advantages and
disadvantages. When a fingerprint is smudged, ridge line direction
of a smudged subregion can not be determined, or mistakenly
determined. This is a disadvantage of the first type of processing. 
And, in the method disclosed in
JP-A-153687/'88, the core point is not used for classification. This
is a disadvantage of the second type processing, as ridge line
directions in a neighborhood of the core point are most important
for classification.Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an
apparatus for automatic fingerprint classification wherein
advantages of the two types of processing are combined.
This object is achieved with the features of the claims.
An apparatus for automatic fingerprint classification according to the
invention is set out in claim 1.For the following descriptions, position coordinates of a
fingerprint image will be determined. The core point of a
fingerprint is used as an origin of the coordinates, a line parallel
to a joint of the finger is determined as the X axis of an x-y
rectangular coordinates. The tip of the finger is taken as +y
direction of the coordinates.In a first embodiment of this invention, a space including the
core point between two ridge lines is traced by a joint of straight
line segments, and from the shape of the result of tracing, the
fingerprint is classified.In a second embodiment of this invention, a predetermined
number of vectors of a predetermined length
