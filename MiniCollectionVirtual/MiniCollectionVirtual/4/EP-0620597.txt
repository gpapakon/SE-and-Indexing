<ABSTRACT>
A voltage protection arrangement (10) comprises a semiconductor substrate 
(12) having at least two electrical conductors (16,18,20) adjacent an edge of 

the substrate.
 

An aperture (22) extends from the edge towards a point between the two 
electrical conductors. The aperture (22) reduces conductance between the 

two electrical conductors (16,18) in a region adjacent the edge of the 
substrate (12), such that if an excess voltage occurs between the two 

conductors (16,18), a reduced current flows in the region.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to voltage protection arrangements. Transistors are prone to damage from electrostatic discharges (ESD's). A transistor electrode is typically connected via a series of contacts to a 
semiconductor substrate. In the event of an ESD, the excess current may 
discharge through the substrate via the series of contacts. A contact of the 
series nearest the edge of the substrate may draw a larger current than the 
other contacts in the series because at the edge there is a greater surface 
area through which current may flow. This excessive current flow may 
damage the contact nearest the edge of the substrate. A further problem is 
that typically at the edge an inherently weak insulation exists between a 
polycrystalline gate of the transistor and the substrate. ESD's have been 
known to result in a short circuit therebetween. This invention seeks to provide a voltage protection arrangement in which 
the above mentioned disadvantages have been mitigated. A voltage protection arrangement comprises a semiconductor substrate 
having at least two electrical conductors adjacent an edge of the substrate. 
An aperture extends from the edge towards a point between the two 
electrical conductors. The aperture reduces conductance between the two 
electrical conductors in a region adjacent the edge of the substrate, such that 
if an excess voltage occurs between the two conductors, a reduced current 
flows in the region.  The semiconductor substrate may comprise diffused silicon. The two electrical conductors may comprise a series of metal contacts formed 
at the surface of the substrate. A polycrystalline transistor gate structure may be attached to the substrate 
via an oxide insulating layer, the gate structure extending to the edge of the 
substrate between the aperture and one of the two conductors. In this way, 
if an excess voltage occurs between the two conductors, the oxide material is 
less susceptible to a short circuit occurring between the gate structure and 
the substrate because of the aperture. The voltage protection arrangement may be incorporated in a transistor 
device. In this way uneven current flow is reduced from the contact nearest the edge 
of the substrate, which also reduces likelihood of a short circuit occurring 
between the polycrystalline gate structure and the substrate. An exemplary embodiment of the invention will now be described with 
reference to the drawing in which:
