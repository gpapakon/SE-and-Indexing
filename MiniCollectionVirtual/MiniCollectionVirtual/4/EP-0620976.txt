<ABSTRACT>
A device for removing the anus of slaughtered animals 
comprises:

 
   a cutting device (3) for cutting out the anus of a slaugntered 

animal, which cutting device comprises a substantially 
cylindrical blade (32) drivable for rotation and translation and 

having a leading cutting edge. 
The device is characterized by positioning means for 
initially positioning the blade such that the centre line 

thereof extends substantially through the anus of the 
slaughtered animal; and

 
   following means for causing the blade to follow a 

curved path such that the cutting edge follows substantially 
the form of the rectum of the slaughtered animal while 

avoiding contact with bone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for removing 
the anus of slaughtered animals, which device comprises: 
a cutting device for cutting out the anus of a 
slaughtered animal, which cutting device comprises a 
substantially cylindrical blade drivable for rotation and 
translation and having a leading cutting edge, and positioning means for initially positioning the 
blade such that the centre line thereof extends 
substantially through the anus of the slaughtered animal. Such a device is known. NL-A-7606104 relates to a device wherein the 
cutting device with the blade can swing in a vertical 
plane. FR-A-2 640 465 likewise relates to a device 
wherein the carriage can perform a swinging movement 
relative to a fixed pivot line. Both cited publications relate to a technique 
wherein the carriage can perform a horizontal 
displacement and can perform a swinging movement in the 
vertical plane relative to a subsequently selected new 
horizontal position. Once a desired position is reached 
the rotatably driven cylindrical blade is displaced 
forward along its centre line to cut out the anus. WO-A-89/10060 relates to a device wherein a pig 
is placed and held in a determined position, the cutting 
device is then moved vertically and can subsequently 
swivel in vertical plane round a pivot axis. The cutting 
edge of the blade herein follows a path such that the 
rectum is in great danger of being damaged, while contact 
between the cutting edge and bone is further not 
excluded. The invention has for its object to embody a 
device of the stated type such that during the cutting  
 
operation the rectum is not damaged in order to prevent 
contamination of usable parts of the slaughtered animal, 
as little meat as possible located round the rectum is 
cut away in order to make the meat production as high as 
possible, and contact between the blade and bone is 
avoided. With a view to the above the device is 
characterized by following means for causing the blade to 
follow a curved path such that the cutting edge follows 
substantially the form of the rectum of the slaughtered 
animal while avoiding contact with bone, 
   said blade being carried by an being drivable 
for axial movement relative to a frame pivotable round a 
horizontal centre line extending transversely of the lengthwise 
direction of the slaughtered animal such that the angle 
which the axis of the blade makes during rotating and 
axial driving during a cutting operation can vary through 
swivelling of the frame, 
   said following means
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device (14) for removing the anus (9) of 
slaughtered animals (2), which device (14) comprises: 


a cutting device for cutting out the anus (9) 
of a slaughtered animal (2), which cutting device 

comprises a substantially cylindrical blade (32) drivable 
for rotation and translation and having a leading cutting 

edge, and 
positioning means for initially positioning the 
blade (32) such that the centre line thereof extends 

substantially through the anus (9) of the slaughtered 
animal (2); 
 
   
characterized by
 
   following means for causing the blade (32) to 

follow a curved path such that the cutting edge follows 
substantially the form of the rectum (43) of the 

slaughtered animal (2) while avoiding contact with bone 
(40, 41, 42),
 
   said blade (32) being carried by and being 

drivable for axial movement relative to a frame (31) 
pivotable round a horizontal centre line (36) extending 

transversely of the lengthwise direction of the 
slaughtered animal (2) such that the angle which the axis 

of the blade (32) makes during rotating and axial driving 
during a cutting operation can vary through swivelling of 

the frame (31),
 
   said following means causing the frame (31) to 

swivel during the cutting operation from a first angular 
position, wherein the axis of the blade (32) makes a 

first angle with the backbone (42) of the slaughtered 
animal (2), to a second angular position range wherein 

the axis of the blade makes a second angle within a 
chosen range with the backbone (42) of the slaughtered 

animal (2), which second angle is greater than the first 
angle.  

 
Device as claimed in claim 1,
 
   
characterized in that
 
   the horizontal centre line round which the frame (31) is 

pivotable is a horizontal pivot axis (36). 
Device (14) as claimed in claim 1,
 
   
characterized in that
 
   the following means are adapted to follow the 

form of the tailbone (41), the pubic bone (40) and/or the 
backbone (42) of the slaughtered animal (2). 
Device (14) as claimed in claim 1,
 
   
characterized in that
 
   the frame (31) is spring-loaded to a rest swivel 

position such that the blade (32) is self-locating. 
Device (14) as claimed in claim 4,
 
   
characterized in that
 
   the frame (31) is coupled for swivelling to a 

pneumatic cylinder (38) which is energized in the 
starting position by medium under relatively high 

pressure, whereby the cylinder (38) has a fixed length 
and, in the situation in which the blade (32) performs a 

cutting operation, is energized by medium under 
relatively low pressure, whereby the cylinder (38) acts 

as a spring. 
Device (14) as claimed in any of the 
foregoing claims,
 
   
characterized in that
 
   the following means comprise a blunt locating 

pin (33) placed coaxially with the cylindrical blade 
(32).
