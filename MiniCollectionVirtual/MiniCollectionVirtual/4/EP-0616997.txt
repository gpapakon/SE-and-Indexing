<ABSTRACT>
A process for the recovery of a carbonylation product from a 
liquid reaction composition of an iridium-catalysed carbonylation 

reaction of a carbonylatable reactant comprises subjecting the 
composition to a vapourisation with or without the addition of heat 

to produce a vapour-fraction and a liquid fraction, the vapour 
fraction comprises carbonylation product and the liquid fraction has 

a water concentration of at least 0.5% by weight to stabilise the 
iridium catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the recovery of a 
carbonylation product from a liquid carbonylation reaction 
composition and in particular to a process for the recovery of a 
carbonylation product from a liquid carbonylation reaction 
composition comprising free or combined iridium carbonylation 
catalyst. British patent GB 1,234,641 describes a process for the 
production of an organic acid or an ester by carbonylation of an 
alcohol, halide, ester, ether or phenol in the presence of a noble 
metal catalyst selected from iridium, platinum, palladium, osmium and 
ruthenium and their compounds and a promoter which is halogen or 
halogen compound. In the liquid-phase embodiment illustrated in 
Figure 1 in GB 1,234,641 the liquid effluent from the reactor has its 
pressure let down and is then introduced into a distillation or flash 
column 30 where the lower boiling compounds consisting principally of 
methyl acetate, methyl iodide and unreacted methanol are separated 
from acetic acid and the other less volatile components such as the 
catalyst system. The lower boiling components are recycled to the 
reactor. The acetic acid and other higher boiling compounds are 
removed from column 30 and enter distillation or flash column 40. In 
this column acetic acid which may contain water is separated from the 
other high boiling components, principally comprised of the catalyst. 
The acetic acid is withdrawn and may be further purified to remove 
water. The high boiling components are recycled to the reactor. If no 
component higher boiling than acetic acid, such as a high boiling  
 
solvent, is present, then some acetic acid may be recycled to return 
the catalyst to the reactor. A similar reaction scheme is described in related US patent US 
3,772,380 which relates to a process for the preparation of 
carboxylic acids and esters by carbonylation of alcohols and their 
ester, ether and halide derivatives in the presence of an 
iridium/halogen catalyst system. According to British patent GB 1,355,146 conventional processing 
schemes involving distillation for the separation of carbonylation 
products from the liquid reaction mass pose problems of catalyst 
inactivation and precipitation for rhodium and iridium carbonylation 
catalyst systems such as those described in GB 1,234,641 because 
these tend to decompose and become inactive when they come in to 
contact with the hot surfaces in distillation column reboilers. One 
solution proposed in GB 1,355,146 is to utilise extremely large 
distilla
