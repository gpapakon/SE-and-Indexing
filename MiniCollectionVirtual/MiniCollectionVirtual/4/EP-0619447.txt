<ABSTRACT>
The edges of the banked plate (3) which are bent round to form the cambers (7,7',7'') are located between the edge areas of two adjoining through openings (4,4',4'') on opposite sides of the intermediate layer. The grooves (8,8',8'') in the elastic metal plate (1) are supported on the edges on the side of the intermediate layer opposite the cambers. The banked plate is preferably set between at least two support plates (2). It is flanged outwards at the edges from one edge to the other alternately to one side and the other.

Flat metallic gasket, in particular cylinder-head gasket,
comprising a plurality of sheet metal plates (1, 2, 3) arranged

one above the other with peripheral edge regions forming an outer
edge and at least two adjacent openings (4, 4', 4"), one

intermediate layer being provided with at least one sheet metal
support plate (2) comprising two sides separated from each other

by the thickness of the sheet metal, which plate (2) is provided
on its edge regions with a superelevation (7, 7', 7'') by at

least one sheet metal superelevation plate (3) bent over at the
edge regions, in which case the at least one sheet metal

superelevation plate (3) extends from one edge region to another
edge region and the intermediate layer is located between outer,

resilient sheet metal plates (1), which in the region of the
opening(s) (4, 4', 4") are provided with one or more

corrugations (8, 8', 8") surrounding a respective opening (4,
4', 4"), characterised in that the bent-over edge regions of the

sheet metal superelevation plate(s) (3) forming the
superelevations (7, 7', 7") are located between the edge regions

of respectively two adjacent openings (4, 4', 4") on opposite
sides of the intermediate layer, in which case the corrugations

(8, 8', 8") of the resilient sheet metal plates (1) are
supported on the edge regions on the side of the intermediate

layer lying opposite the superelevations (7, 7', 7").
Flat gasket according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the sheet metal superelevation plate (3) is located between at

least two sheet metal support plates (2) and at the edge regions
is beaded-over outwards from one edge region to the other

alternately towards one and the other side.
Flat gasket according to Claim 1, characterised in that
with two sheet metal superelevation plates (3, 3'), both are

beaded-over outwards at one edge region towards one side and at
an edge region adjacent thereto are not beaded-over, so that

located at each edge region is a beaded-over and a non beaded-over 
edge section of the sheet metal superelevation plates (3,
Flat gasket according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in

that the corrugations (8, 8', 8") of the elastic sheet metal
plates (1) are supported on the sides of the sheet metal support

plates (2) lying opposite the beaded-over edge sections of the
sheet metal superelevation plate(s) (3, 3').
Flat gasket according to Claim 1, characterised in that
with two sheet metal superelevation plates (3, 3'), the latter,

located on both sides of the sheet metal support plate (2) and
possibly at least one further sheet metal support plate (2), are

folded on one edge region and unfolded on an edge region adjacent
thereto, so that located on each edge region is a folded and an

unfolded edge section of the sheet metal superelevation plates
(3, 3').
Flat gasket according to Claim 5, characterised in that
in the edge regions of the openings (4, 4', 4"), the sheet metal

superelevation plates (3, 3') with the folded edge sections
extend as far as the respective edge of the openings (4, 4',

4").
Flat gasket according to Claim 1, characterised in that
with two sheet metal superelevation plates (3, 3'), the latter

are beaded-over on both sides of the sheet metal support plate(s)
(2) from one edge region to the other alternately towards one and

the other side of the sheet metal support plate(s) (2).
Flat gasket according to Claim 1, characterised in that
in the edge region of one opening (4), the sheet metal

superelevation plate (3) is beaded-over on one side of the sheet
metal support plate(s) (2) and in the edge region of one adjacent

opening (4'), is folded-over on the other side of the sheet metal
support plate(s) (2). 
Flat gasket according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the sheet metal support plate(s) (2)

comprises (comprise) a step (6) between two adjacent edge
regions.
Flat gasket according to Claim 9, characterised in that
the two sheet metal support plates (2) comprise steps (6) fitting

one in the other.
Flat gasket according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the beaded-over edge regions of the sheet

metal superelevation plate(s) (3, 3') are additionally folded
over.
Flat gasket according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the sheet metal support plate (2) is

provided on its edge regions with a peripheral step (6).
Flat gasket according to one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that at least the sheet metal support plate (2)

is provided on one or both sides over part of its surface or over
its entire surface with a covering of softer material than that

of the sheet metal support plate (2).
