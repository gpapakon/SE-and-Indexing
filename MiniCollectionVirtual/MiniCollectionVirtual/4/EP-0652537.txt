<ABSTRACT>
A patient (7) is irradiated by an X-ray source (1) in a computed 
tomography apparatus. The radiation is subsequently detected by the detector cells (5) of 

a position-sensitive X-ray detection system (4) and the intensities detected are applied to 
a computing device (16). Absorption as well as elastic and inelastic scattering of X-rays 

occur within the patient (7). The data acquired is corrected for elastic (coherent) scatter 
by deriving a deconvolution function from the elastic scatter function, which 

deconvolution function is applied to the data. The elastic scatter function is determined, 
for example by a computer simulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of computed tomography in which X-rays
from an X-ray source are irradiated onto an object to be examined and are detected by means
of a position-sensitive X-ray detector array which occupies a substantially fixed position
relative to the X-ray source, the X-ray source and the X-ray detector array being moved
together in a number of orientations relative to the object to be examined in order to
pick up a number of X-ray images, a density distribution of the object being
reconstructed by means of the detected X-ray images and unsharpness in the
reconstructed image being reduced by means of deconvolution. The invention also
relates to a apparatus for carrying out such a method.Such an apparatus and method are known from EP-A 0 353 299. The
cited publication describes a method of processing data acquired by means of a
computed tomography apparatus (CT scanner) in which the X-ray source emits radiation
which originates not only from a focal point but also, unintentionally, from the
surroundings of the focal point. These undesirable X-rays are caused by scattering of
electrons within the X-ray tube and, consequently, the X-rays originate from a
extensive area. Because the X-ray source is no longer substantially punctiform, the
reconstructed image contains unsharp edges and artefacts. In the known method the
image artefacts caused by the source are reduced by deconvolution with a PSF (point
spread function) describing the characteristics of the X-ray source.In CT scanners in which the problem described in EP-A 0 353 299 does
not occur, or in which this problem has been adequately mitigated, unsharpness and
artefacts still occur in the reconstructed images. Notably a loss of contrast occurs.
These image artefacts can be attributed partly to incoherent (Compton) scattering.
Incoherent scattering is uniformly distributed in space and the effects thereof can be
removed during reconstruction by subtracting a constant value from the signal measured
by each cell in the detector. Said constant value is dependent on the dimensions of the
object to be examined. Taking incoherent scatter into account in this manner results in a 
substantial improvement of the reconstructed image.However, it has been found that a given degree of unsharpness and
artefacts remain in the reconstructed image also after the above correction.It is the object of the invention to identify the source of the remaining
image defects and to provide a method for reducing the consequences thereof in the
reconstructed

A method of computed tomography, in which X-rays from an X-ray source (1)
irradiate an object (7) to be examined and are detected by means of a position-sensitive X-ray
