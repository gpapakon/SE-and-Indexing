3 and a bottom panel member 5, part of the outer surface 

of said body member being provided with printing 9 of an organic 
solvent based ink, wherein a thick foamed heat-insulating 

layer 11 that is made of a thermoplastic synthetic resin 
film is formed in the printed area of said outer surface 

whereas a less thick foamed heat-insulating layer 11 that is 
made of the same thermoplastic synthetic resin film is formed 

in the non-printed area of said outer surface. If desired,

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat-insulating paper
container having a foamed layer of a thermoplastic synthetic
resin film on the outer wall surface of the body member. More
particularly, the invention relates to a paper container in
which the thickness of the foamed heat-insulating layer in one
area differs from that in another area.Several types of heat-insulating containers have been
used commercially to pack hot liquids. A polystyrene foam
heat-insulating container is one example. This is produced by
a process comprising the addition of a foaming agent to
polystyrene, casting the mixture into a mold, heating the
resin under pressure to foam it, and removing the shaped
article from the mold. The container thus produced has
outstanding heat-insulating properties but, on the other hand,
it needs reconsiderations from the viewpoint of saving
petroleum resources or increasing the efficiency of
incinerating waste containers. As a further problem, a curved
printing press or a stamp printing press is required to print
on the outer surfaces of polystyrene foam heat-insulating
containers since printing can only be effected after
individual cups have been shaped. Thus, the polystyrene foam
containers have suffered the disadvantage of low printability.Another type of heat-insulating paper containers are such
that the outer side wall of the body member is entirely
surrounded by a corrugated paper jacket. The process of 
manufacturing such container involves additional steps of
forming the corrugated paper jacket and bonding it to the
outer surface of the side wall of the body member. This type
of containers have various other defects. First, letters,
figures or other symbols are printed on the corrugated surface
and the resulting deformed letters or patterns do not have
good aesthetic appeal to consumers. Secondly, the jacket is
bonded to the side wall of the body member in such a manner
that only the valley ridges contact the side wall and the bond
between the jacket and the side wall is so weak that the two
will easily separate. Thirdly, containers having the
corrugated jacket are not suitable for nesting and, hence,
need a large area of storage.Still another type of heat-insulating paper containers
have a "dual structure" wherein an inner cup is given a
different taper than an outer cup to form a heat-insulating
air layer in the space between the two cups. The two cups are
made integral by curling their respective upper edges into a
brim. Containers of this type have very good printability
since the outer cup

member (3) and a bottom panel member (5), part (9) of the

outer surface of said body member being provided with printing

layer (11) that is made of the same thermoplastic synthetic
resin film is formed in the non-printed area of said outer

surface
the thick foamed heat-insulating layer (11) resulting

from the residual solvent or solvents in the printing
ink and other ink components such as pigment having been

combined to lower the strength of adhesion of the
thermoplastic synthetic resin film to the paper sheet,

whereupon the film in the printed area has been foamed
at an accelerated rate to form said thick foamed

heat-insulating layer. 
A container according to claim 1 wherein said thick
foamed heat-insulating layer (11) is formed in the upper half

of the body member (3) in an area near the brim (7).
A container according to claim 1 wherein at least the
inner surface of the body member (3) is laminated either with

a thermoplastic synthetic resin film (13) having a higher
softening point than the thermoplastic synthetic resin film

(11) laminated on the outer surface of the body member or
with an aluminium foil (13).
A process for producing a heat-insulating paper container
(1) comprising the steps of providing a body member

(3) and a bottom panel member (5), applying printing to part 
(9) of the outer surface of said body member with an organic

solvent based ink, covering all outer surfaces of said body
member including the printed area with a thermoplastic synthetic

resin film (11), fabricating the thus treated body
member and the bottom panel member into a container, heating

the container so that said thermoplastic synthetic resin film
is foamed, thereby forming a thick foamed heat-insulating

layer in the area of the outer surface of said body member
which has been printed with the organic solvent based ink and

part of said thermoplastic synthetic resin film, and subsequently

heating the container so that said thermoplastic synthetic
resin film is foamed, thereby forming a thick foamed

heat-insulating layer in the area of the outer surface of
said body member which has been printed with the organic solvent

based ink and forming a less thick foamed heat-insulating
layer in the non-printed area of the outer surface of

said body member, said thermoplastic synthetic resin film remaining
unfoamed on both sides of the area where said slit

has been cut and 
the residual solvent or solvents in the printing ink and
