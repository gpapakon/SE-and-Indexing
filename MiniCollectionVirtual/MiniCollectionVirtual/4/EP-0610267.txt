<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is related to a method and an arrangement to determine the lowest speed at which an activating pin (9) shall activate a detonator (10). According to the invention that is achieved by a hydraulic medium (11), the viscous property of which is used to control the transfer of energy from the activating pin (9) to the detonator (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method whereby 
the activation of a detonator device intended for 
pyrotechnic charges, activated by a percussion pin, and 
comprising a percussion detonator cap and a percussion pin 
displaceable against the latter by external action, is made 
dependent on a minimum speed of displacement of the 
percussion pin. The invention thus relates to 
predetermining the minimum speed required for the 
percussion pin to activate the percussion detonator cap. 
The invention also relates to a device constructed in 
accordance with the principle of the invention. There is a need, in certain technical applications, 
inter alia for speed sensors, to be able to predetermine 
the minimum speed at which a percussion pin will activate 
a percussion detonator cap against which it is moved, i.e., 
the speed of the percussion pin is required to control the 
energy transmission to the percussion detonator cap so that 
a low speed gives little energy transmission, i.e., no 
activation of the percussion detonator cap, while a speed 
in excess of a predetermined value gives an energy 
transmission which guarantees activation of the percussion 
detonator cap. AT-B-363 011 on which disclosure the preambles 
of independent claims 1 and 2 are based, discloses a shell comprising a 
detonator cap and a percussion pin for activating the cap 
wherein the energy transmission between the pin and the cap 
is controlled by a hydraulic medium disposed in a first 
cavity connecting with a second cavity into which the 
hydraulic medium is forced when the pin is displaced. The method and arrangement according to the 
invention are specially adapted to control the speed  
 
relationship of percussion pin activated detonator devices 
of the type which are expected to be exposed to 
considerable impact energy but with which the speed of 
impact may vary very considerably. A specific technical 
area of this kind which is increasingly topical is the 
activation of crash protection for motor vehicle  
 
passengers, of the airbag type, in which the 
displacement of the percussion pin, for example, can be 
rendered dependent upon the vehicle deformation. Thus 
the invention can more particularly be utilised for 
lateral crash protection, in which the release of the 
percussion pin, for example, can be made dependent on 
the deformation of a vehicle door, and in which it must 
be considered desirable that the crash protection 
should not be triggered in the event of deformation of 
the door in question at the absolute

A method of making a detonator activation dependent 
on a predetermined detonator device for minimum speed of 

displacement of a percussion pin (9, 14, 15) in a 
pyrotechnic charge (7) containing a percussion detonator 

cap (10) and a displaceable percussion pin (9, 14, 15) for 
activating the latter in which the energy transmission 

between the percussion pin (9, 14, 15) and the percussion 
detonator cap (10) is controlled by a deformable hydraulic 

and at least substantially non-compressible medium (11) 
disposed in a first cavity adapted thereto, said first 

cavity being connected via a constriction (13) to a second 
cavity (12, 17) into which the hydraulic medium (11) can be 

forced while the percussion pin (9, 14, 15) is being 
displaced, characterised in that the second cavity is 

initially empty and the method comprises adapting the 
constriction (13) to the viscosity of the hydraulic medium 

(11) so that the latter, when the percussion pin (9, 14, 
15) is displaced at least at the said predetermined minimum 

speed, is not forced through the constriction (13) in time 
with the movement of the percussion pin (9, 14, 15) but 

instead will transmit a sufficient quantity of energy to 
the percussion detonator cap (10) to activate the latter. 
A percussion pin activated detonator device for 
pyrotechnic charges comprising a percussion detonator cap 

(10) and a percussion pin (9, 14, 15) displaceable to 
activate the cap, adapted to require, in accordance with 

the method of Claim 1, a preset minimum speed at which a 
displacement of the percussion pin (9, 14, 15) results in 

activation of the same, in which the energy transmission  
 

between the percussion pin (9, 14, 15) and the percussion 
detonator cap (10) is made dependent on a deformable but at 

least substantially non-compressible hydraulic medium (11)

predetermined minimum speed the hydraulic medium is not 

forced through the constriction (13) in time with the
