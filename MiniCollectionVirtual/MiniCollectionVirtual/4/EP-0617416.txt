<ABSTRACT>
With this invention, the reference velocity data 
(24d) corresponding to the number of the remaining 

tracks to the destination target position of the optical 
head (3) is stored, and on the basis of the reference 

velocity data (24d), the velocity of the optical head 
(3) is controlled. The reference velocity data (24d) 

contains the maximum velocity region data and deceleration 
data for the optical head (3). The deceleration 

data is obtained by subtracting the steady-state 
deviation from the velocity trajectory. The steady-state 

velocity deviation is obtained from the response 
characteristic of the optical-head velocity control 

system. When the optical head (3) is moved, the reference 
velocity data corresponding to the number of the 

remaining tracks between the current position of the 
optical head (3) and the destination target position is 

read. On the basis of this read-out reference velocity 
data, a linear motor (31) for driving the optical head 

(3) is controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an information processing
apparatus for reproducing the information recorded on a
recording medium such as an optical disk with recording
tracks, and more particularly to an information processing
apparatus capable of an improved seek operation.Optical-disk apparatuses have been put to practical
use which record and reproduce information on and from
an optical disk with recording tracks by means of laser
light emitted from a semiconductor laser provided on an
optical head.In such optical-disk apparatuses, the optical head
is moved radially across the optical disk, or so as to
cross tracks, by means of a linear motor. The movement
of the optical head by the linear motor causes a spot
of laser light to move to a target track. In some
optical-disk apparatuses, when the optical head has
approached the target track, the moving velocity
(hereinafter, referred to as the velocity) of the optical
head is controlled according to the decelerating
reference speed data, as disclosed in JP-A
KOKAI Publication No. 1-271921.In the case of the above-mentioned type of
apparatus, a velocity control system for controlling the
velocity of an optical head is designed to decrease the
velocity of the optical head as the light spot
approaches the target track. The velocity trajectory 
(or the target velocity which is designed for the optical
head to move along) itself designed to include the
decelerating velocity data is referred to for the reference
velocity during a seek operation. In this case,
at the time when the light spot has reached the target
track, the velocity of the light spot must be sufficiently
slow so that a tracking operation (i.e., the
operation of centralizing the light spot on the track)
can be effected reliably.However, since in such an optical disk apparatus,
the control band of the velocity control system (or the
response characteristic) has a finite value, there
arises a velocity deviation of the actual velocity of
the optical head from the reference speed (equal to the
velocity trajectory) during deceleration. Specifically,
when the optical head's actual velocity is greater
than the reference velocity, the optical head's velocity
has not become sufficiently low when the head has
reached the target track. As a result, in the prior
art, the head has sometimes failed to switch over to a
tracking operation. Consequently, it has been difficult
to shorten the moving (seek) time of the optical
head. To reduce the velocity deviation described
above, for example, disturbance tolerance
