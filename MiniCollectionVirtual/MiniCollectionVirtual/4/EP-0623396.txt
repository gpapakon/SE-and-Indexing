<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (1) for cleaning lines (2), for example ducts, pipes or sewer ducts, which has an end-side inlet or a shaft or access location arranged laterally with respect to its line of progression, has a flushing head (3) and a feed line (4) to said flushing head (3), it being possible to introduce cleaning fluid or cleaning water at high pressure into the line to be cleaned, to be precise expediently from that side of the flushing head which is connected to the feed line (4) thereof. The apparatus (1) further exhibits a suction pipe (5) which is fixed in the pipe or duct to be cleaned and takes in the fluid, discharged by the flushing head (3), and the particles of dirt received therefrom and delivers them to a cleaning vehicle. In order, in this arrangement, to prevent flushing water or freed gases and vapours from being able to pass through between suction pipe and wall of the line (2) to be cleaned, the suction pipe (5) has an exterior seal (7) which can be pressed against the wall of the line (2) and can preferably be widened in order to carry out this press-on action.

An apparatus (1) for cleaning pipes, drains, 
particularly sewers, or similar pipelines (2) having 

at least one end or lateral manhole, shaft or similar 
entrance, the apparatus including a flushing head (3) 

and a supply line (4) to the flushing head (3) 
capable of feeding cleaning liquid or cleaning water 

particularly at high pressure into the pipeline to be 
cleaned, wherein the flushing head (3) and supply 

line (4) thereof are adapted to be inserted through 
the entrance and the supply line (4) extends through 

said entrance during the cleaning operation and 
during the infeed and withdrawal of the flushing head 

(3), wherein the apparatus (1) furthermore has a 
suction pipe which is to be disposed in the pipeline 

(2) to be cleaned and serves to take up the dislodged 
and suspended particles of dirt as well as the waste 

cleaning liquid and to deliver the same to a cleaning 
vehicle for instance, 
characterized in that
 the 
suction pipe (5) or intake end (6) thereof is adapted 

to be detachably located in the pipeline (2) at said 
internally situated end (6) by means of an external 

seal (7) pressable against the wall of the pipeline 
(2), the opposite zone of the suction pipe (5) 

forming a transition to the entrance and to the 
vehicle, and that the supply line carrying the 

flushing head (3) runs from the outside, via an inlet 
(8), through the wall (9) of the suction pipe (5) or 

through the wall (9) of an elbow (10) belonging to 
said suction pipe (5) to the free intake end (6) of  

 
the suction pipe (5) and is movable through said free 

end (6) of the suction pipe (5). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that by means of an elbow (10) or fitting (13) the 

suction pipe (5) forms a transition from the pipeline 
(2) to be cleaned to the entrance or shaft. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the external seal (7) on the 

suction pipe (5) is an inflatable gasket having a 
connection (14) for supplying a pressure medium, 

preferably compressed air. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterized in that the suction pipe (5) has a pipe 

section extending into the pipeline (2) to be cleaned 
and that the seal (7) runs approximately from the 

orifice (6) of said pipe section to the vicinity of 
the bending zone of the elbow (10) or to the fitting 

(13). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4, 
characterized in that the outside wall of the 

expandable or inflatable seal (7) radially remote 
from the suction pipe (5) is capable of bulging 

radially and in the expanded condition has in the 
region of its largest expansion or bulge a total 

radial thickness corresponding at least to half the 
pipe radius, particularly half the pipe diameter of 

the suction pipe. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that the radial expandability of the 

seal (7) accommodates several standard cross sections  
 

of pipelines (2) to be cleaned, so that the apparatus 
(1) fits in pipelines, drains or ducts having a 

cross-sectional dimension or diameter of about 200 mm 
to about 400 mm. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the suction orifice (6) of the 

suction pipe (5) has a directional change opposed to 
the curvature of an elbow (10), particularly a slope 

or further curvature directing the intake opening 
towards the underside or base (2a) of a substantially 

horizontal pipeline (2) in the position of use. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 7, characterized in 
that the directional change provided at the suction 

orifice (6) is a pipe length in the form of an elbow 
or a sloping pipe length, adapted to be detachably 

coupled to the suction pipe (5). 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the inlet (8) for the supply 

line (7) to the flushing head (3) in the suction pipe 
(5) is arranged on that side of the suction pipe (5) 

which faces away from the intake end (6) and that 
said inlet (8) takes the form of a sliding seal for 

the supply line (4) particularly in the form of a 
tube, said inlet (8) being designed for example as a 

socket particularly with play relative to the supply 
line (4). 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, 

characterized in that at the end remote from the 
intake end (6), the suction pipe (5) and/or the elbow 

(10) thereof has a coupling (11) for detachable  
 

connection to a suction pipe (15) leading, for 
example, to the cleaning vehicle. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that a guide for the supply line (4) 

is arranged at the exterior of the suction pipe (5) 
and/or elbow (10, adjacent to the inlet (8). 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 11, 
characterized in that the guide situated at the 

exterior of the elbow (10) or fitting (13) of the 
suction pipe (5) has at least one, preferably two 

rollers (16) on which the supply line (4), 
particularly a flexible supply line, lies as it 

moves. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the inside cross 

section of the suction pipe (5) substantially exceeds 
the outside cross section of the flushing head (3) 

and preferably has a diameter of at least double the 
size.
