<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a thermal image analysis 
system (1) which includes a reference signal generating circuit 

(10) for generating two or more reference signals, an image synthesizing 
circuit (11) for combining an image outputted from an 

image output circuit (9) with the reference signals, a reference 
signal sensing circuit (13) for sensing the reference signals 

from an image signal inputted into an image input circuit (8), a 
numerical input circuit (12) for inputting temperature information 

corresponding to the reference signals and a compensation 
circuit (14) for compensating the image signal, based on the temperature 

information and reference signals. 
The reference signal generating circuit (10) generates 
reference signals of two or more levels. The reference signal 

sensing circuit (13) senses the reference signals from an image 
signal reproduced by an image recording/reproducing system (2). 

The compensation circuit (14) compensates the reproduced image 
signal to the state similar to that of the image signal before 

being recorded, based on the temperature information inputted 
from the numerical input circuit (12). 
Such a thermal image analysis system (1) can compensate the 
image signal degraded or changed through the image 

recording/reproducing system (2) to improve the accuracy in thermal 
image analysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal image analysis
system for analyzing the temperature on the surface of a subject
by taking an infrared image of the surface of the subject through
a combination of an optical system and an image sensor and processing
the information of the taken image. The present invention
particularly concerns such a thermal image analysis system having
a function of performing the thermal image analysis with respect
to the information of an image reproduced after the image information
outputted from the thermal image analysis system has been
recorded in an image recording/reproducing apparatus.Fig. 13 exemplifies a thermal image analysis system constructed
in accordance with the prior art, as disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. JP-A-58-120136. In Fig. 13, reference
numeral 1 denotes a thermal image analysis system; and 2 an image
recording/reproducing system. The thermal image analysis system 1
comprises a sync separation circuit 3, a delay circuit 4, a
sample-and-hold circuit 5, a level judgment circuit 6, a thermal
image analyzing unit 7, an image input circuit 8 and an image
output circuit 9.The analysis of the thermal image analysis system 1 will be
described below.Fig. 14(a) shows a waveform of an image output signal from 
the thermal image analysis system 1 to the image recording/reproducing
system 2. Sync signal parts are designated by symbol p
while absolute temperature signal parts inserted to measure
absolute temperatures are indicated by symbol r. The signal level
R at each of the signal parts r is variable depending on the
range of temperature in the thermal image analysis system 1 and
will be recorded in the image recording/reproducing system 2 with
the information of thermal image when an image signal is outputted
from the image output circuit 9 and recorded in the image
recording/reproducing system 2.As the image signal is reproduced by the image recording/reproducing
system 2, the signal level R is also reproduced
with the thermal image information in the same form as shown in
Fig. 14(a). In the thermal image analysis system 1, the sync
separation circuit 3 only fetches such sync signal parts as shown
in Fig. 14(b) from the image signal shown in Fig. 14(a). The
delay circuit 4 retards the fetched sync signal parts by a given
time td to form such a signal as shown in Fig. 14(c).The delay circuit 4 is set so that the delayed sync signal
parts are located at positions corresponding to the respective
absolute temperature signal parts r. The sample-and-hold
