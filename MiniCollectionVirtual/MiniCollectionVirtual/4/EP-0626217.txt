<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for working up of possibly 
partly polluted materials by accommodating them in an 

unleaching plastic material. Therewith objects can be 
obtained with very good mechanical properties, which, when 

the normal costs necessary for transporting aand disposal 
of the polluted waste materials are also calculated, are 

competitive of cost price and combine good till very good 
mechanical properties with the possibility of any desired 

and attractive appearance. Especially with the invention 
debris washing silt or other silt is worked up, which gives 

an unique possibility to reuse polluted silt and therewith 
to decrease the use of plastic material. As plastic 

material can be considered anhydrous as well as emulsions 
in water and especially artificial resin has appeared 

favourable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the working up of waste materials 
which may at least partly have too high a pollution grade 
to be disposed of by dumping or to be used in building and 
road construction and/or hydraulic engineering, without 
expensive measures being necessary to prevent contact with 
ground water or spreading of polluted ground water. The concept of waste material in fact indicates an in 
itself undesired product that has no direct useful 
application. Once such an application has been found the 
same material can be called a raw material. In practice, by waste material is meant a material, which 
in its present state has no useful application and/or 
requires additional payment, sometimes in the form of 
transport free of charge, when being transferred. Examples 
of such waste materials are debris and materials derived 
therefrom such as refract sand, demolish sand and wash 
silt; glass; used plastic material that is not, or only 
after labour-intensive selection, suitable to be used; 
fibres of natural or artificial materials and even of 
asbestos, moulding sand; sludge, such as paper sludge, 
sludge from purification of waste water or preparation of 
drinking-water and used steal grit, often together with the 
material removed by grit blasting that for example may 
contain dyeing materials. The working up of such waste materials, in particular 
residues of demolition material, poses a serious problem, 
because on the one hand a large flow of waste materials is 
generated and on the other hand the regulations with regard 
to polluted substances are increasingly tightened and the 
possibilities of disposing them by dumping or to reuse them 
are increasingly diminishing. Moreover, an additional 
difficulty is that lack of polluting substances in a non-permissible 
concentration, cannot by far be guaranteed in  
 
all cases. Here in particular the leaching of the pollution out of the 
waste materials plays an important role. In order to 
determine said leachings, there are standard tests and, 
based thereon, requirements are set that impede pollution 
of the soil in which the polluted waste materials are 
situated, and reduce it to a minimum. Also many forms of 
reuse, such as for instance for land fill and road 
foundations, are subject to the same regulations and are 
consequently not permitted in case of substances with too 
high a pollution grade. As a result of said difficulties in working up and reusing 
waste materials respectively, the disposal of such 
substances, in particular when

<CLAIMS>
Method for working up waste materials with possibly at 
least partly a too high pollution grade to be allowed to be 

disposed of in building, road construction and/or hydraulic 
engineering, characterized in that the waste materials are 

accommodated in an object of unleaching plastic material 
suitable for building, road construction and/or hydraulic 

engineering. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
waste materials contain silt, such as debris washing silt, 

burnt or not burnt sludge of effluent water purification 
plants, sewage silt or, fluvial mud and/or grindings of 

severely polluted walls, such as the inner walls of 
chimneys. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the waste materials contain demolishing and/or breaking 

sand. 
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the waste materials are accommodated in the object 

together with filler materials which in itself are not 
waste materials. 
Method according to any of the claims 1-4, characterized 
in that waste materials and/or filler materials are 

accommodated in the plastic material with a particle size 
distribution which causes a small interstice volume (so-called 

Fuller curve). 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the plastic material before its 

setting is a low viscous liquid. 
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that a 
detergent has been added to the liquid. 
Method according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that 
the mixture of waste and filler materials with the non set 

plastic material is vibrated. 
Method according to claim 6, 7 or 8, characterized in 
that the plastic material is an artificial resin. 
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
non set plastic material is thixotropic. 
Method for working up demolition debris, characterized 
in that, possibly after breaking, the material is sieved to 

fine and courser fractions, after which at least the finer 
fractions are worked up according to any of the claims 1-10 

after which the whole of plastic material and demolition 
debris is reused. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the waste materials and possibly 

filler materials are used in fractions of different 
particle sizes in such a mutual proportion that between the 

particles an interstitial volume remains which is as small 
as possible for instance smaller than 8 vol %. 
Method according to any preceding claim, characterized 
in that at least one of the waste materials to be disposed 

of contains fibres, such as asbestos, glass or rock wool 
fibres, the fibre containing material being crushed and the 

fibres obtained by crushing being used as a waste material. 
Method for manufacturing a solid object which is 
suitable for application in building, road construction or 

hydraulic engineering by using the method according to any 
of the preceding claims, characterized in that a mixture of 

waste materials, possibly filler materials and resin is put 
into a mould and set therein. 
Method according to claim 14, characterized in that the 
inner wall of the mould has been provided with a discharge 

 
enhancing agent. 
Object obtained by application of the method of claim 
14 or 15.
