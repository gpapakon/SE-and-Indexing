<DESCRIPTION>
 DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE AND METHODTECHNICAL FIELD The invention generally relates to diagnostic devices, and more particularly to a point-of-care diagnostic device useful in the quick differential diagnosis of a myocardial infarction or similar event in a subject.BACKGROUND ART Various cardiac markers are used in the diagnosis of cardiac function and disease. Among these markers is troponin. Troponin is a protein complex which regulates the contraction of striated muscle. The troponin protein complex includes three distinct proteins. The first is troponin I which is an inhibitory sub-unit. The second is troponin C which is a calcium binding sub-unit. The third is troponin T, a sub-unit which attaches the troponin protein complex to tropomyosin on the thin filament of the striated muscle.Troponin I is believed to exist in three isoforms, one of which exists in cardiac muscle, while the other two exist in skeletal muscle. The skeletal muscle isoforms are nearly identical, and have molecular weights of about 19,800 Daltons. Structurally, the cardiac isoform of troponin I is about 60% similar to the skeletal isoforms, and has a molecular weight of about 22,500 Daltons.After the onset of an acute myocardial infarction, the cardiac isoform of troponin I is measurable in the serum after four to six hours. Peak serum concentrations are reached after twelve to eighteen hours after the acute myocardial infarction. Unlike other cardiac markers (e.g., CK-MB and myoglobin), troponin I levels may remain elevated in the serum for several days before returning to normal. Because of these characteristics, the cardiac isoform of troponin I is used in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.For example, the OPUS Troponin I from Behring Diagnostics, Inc. of Westwood, MA is a fluorogenic enzyme-linked immunoassay ("ELISA" or "EIA") for the quantitative measurement of troponin I in serum and heparinized plasma. This assay uses two goat polyclonal antibodies that are purified to recognize different polypeptide segments believed to be unique to the cardiac isoform of troponin I. 

 As detailed in U.S. Patent 5,604,105 issued February 18, 1997 to Jackowski ("the Jackowski patent"), speed is of the utmost importance in obtaining a reliable diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction. The choice and efficacy of treatment depends to some extent on obtaining a reliable diagnosis of a myocardial infarction versus some other disease state, such as dyspnea.In the Jackowski patent, a method and device for diagnosing and distinguishing

CLAIMS What is claimed is: 1. A method of performing an assay comprising: providing an assay system which receives a biological liquid sample potentially containing at least one analyte of interest and outputs a light signal indicative of the rate of reaction between said analyte of interest and a reactive element within the assay system; continuously measuring light emitted from said assay system over time; continuously correlating said rate of reaction to a concentration of said analyte of interest; and determining the concentration of at least one analyte of interest in said biological liquid sample based on said correlation of said light in a time period less than about five minutes.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said at least one analyte of interest is an ischemic marker.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein said ischemic marker is selected from the group comprising troponin I, CK-MB, and myoglobin.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said assay system comprises: a light source; a biosensor comprising a waveguide having at least one planar surface, said waveguide associated in liquid tight attachment with a first member, said first member, in conjunction with the waveguide, defining at least one reservoir for containing said biological liquid sample, the planar surface of said waveguide being associated in part with capture molecules, and an inlet and outlet in fluid communication with said reservoir for infusing and draining said biological liquid sample into and out of said reservoir so as to allow the biological liquid sample to contact said capture molecules; and a light detector for detecting light passed through said planar surface. 

5. The method of claim 4, further comprising: simultaneously introducing tracers molecules and a biological liquid sample potentially containing at least one analyte of interest into said at least one reservoir of said biosensor, wherein said tracer molecules are complementary with said respective capture molecules and emit fluorescent light in response to stimulation by light of an appropriate wavelength; and introducing a light beam from said light source into said waveguide to propagate light of said appropriate wavelength to stimulation a fluorescent light response in said tracer molecules which have attached to a portion of at least one said analyte of interest which has been captured by said capture molecules on said waveguide planar surface.
6. An assay system for analyzing a biological liquid sample, comprising: a light source; a waveguide having at least one planar surface and being optically associated with a rear lens oriented for reading light from said light source passing through said waveguide, to monitor coupling efficiency and beam quality; a first member associated in liquid tight attachment with said waveguide, wherein said first member, in conjunction with the waveguide, defining at least one reservoir for containing the biological liquid sample while a planar surface of the waveguide defines a floor or ceiling of said reservoir, the planar surface being associated in part with capture molecules; an inlet and outlet in fluid communication with said reservoir for infusing and draining said biological liquid into said reservoir so as to allow the biological liquid to contact said capture molecules; a light detector for detecting light passed through said planar surface, which generates a signal indicating the intensity of said detected light; and a controller for monitoring the intensity signal and correlates said signal to the concentration of said analyte of interest in said biological sample. 

7. A method of performing an assay comprising: simultaneously detecting for a plurality of analytes in a sample, at least one of said plurality of analytes having known parameters indicative of an acute metabolic or disease state; simultaneously determining the concentration of the plurality of analytes in said sample; continuing with said simultaneous determination until said at least one of the plurality of analytes has been reliably determined to be present in an amount indicative of the metabolic or disease state; and reporting said reliable determination of the presence of the plurality of analytes in an amount indicative of the metabolic or disease state.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein said detection of the other analyte or analytes in the plurality of analytes continues after the report of the reliable determination of the an amount indicative of the acute metabolic or disease state in order to accurately determine the presence or concentration of the other analytes.
9. The method of claim 7 wherein the reporting of the reliable determination of the an amount indicative of the metabolic or disease state takes place by an audio or visual alarm.
