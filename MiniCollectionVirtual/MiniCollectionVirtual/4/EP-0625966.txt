<ABSTRACT>
Primary amine salts of derivatives having formula; R'O-CO-NH-CH(R)-COOH wherein R is -CH2OH or -CHOHO-CH3, and R' is an optionally insaturated alkyl group having at least 10 carbon atoms, as well as the at least partial salification products of the derivatives of formula (I) with primary amines, and whose salification degree is sufficient to obtain, in aqueous solution, a pH higher than 6 and lower than 7.5; and cosmetic compositions, in the form of emulsions, containing them. These primary amine salts which have hydrating properties for the skin, have also the property of stabilizing emulsions.
