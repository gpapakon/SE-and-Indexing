<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus 
capable of recording video, audio and other information 

on a magnetic tape by, for example, the helical 
scanning method. A rotary head is rotated at an m-fold 

speed to record intermittent tracks on the magnetic 
tape so that real-time simultaneous monitoring 

is performed. By high-speed dubbing due to high-density 
intermittent recording and by increasing the 

number of repetition of track scanning, the information 
is recorded and reproduced simultaneously with a 

plurality of channels. Any tracking error is detected 
to form a continuous and uniform track pattern. With 

this intermittent comb-shaped recording, reciprocating 
recording and reproducing can be realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic recording
and reproducing apparatus for recording video and
audio information on a magnetic tape in a helically
scanning system.For accurately recording a digital video signal
and a digital audio signal by a digital video tape recorder,
it has hitherto necessary to confirm the state
of recording by reproducing the recorded data soon
after recording, namely, to perform simultaneous
monitoring. Insert editing is writing editing a part of the
already recorded track with a different signal and is
an effective function in VTR (video tape recorder) for
recording and reproducing video and audio signals. A
four-frequency pilot method is adopted to the servo
method of 8 mm video using an 8 mm tape. This prior
art insert editing method is exemplified by Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 79550/1985.In the prior magnetic recording and reproducing
apparatus using the pilot signal method, in addition
to two ordinary magnetic heads arranged on the
peripheral edge of the rotary drum and angularly
spaced from each other by 180°, at least one magnetic
head is used so that the track pattern will be continuous
and uniform also during insert editing.FIG. 12 shows a circuit of a rotary-head-type
VTR to which the magnetic recording and reproducing
apparatus is incorporated. In FIG. 12, a first circulating
frequency generator 461 generates four signals
of different frequencies one for each field, circulating
four fields as one cycle, according to the 
head switching pulses inputted to an input terminal
462.For example, in recording video signals by NTSC
(National Television System Committee) method, these
four frequencies should be selected as follows: f1 =
fosc/58, f2 = fosc/50, f3 = fosc/36, and f4 = fosc/40,
where fosc = 378 fh (fh: frequency of horizontal synchronizing
signal). The output of this frequency generator
461 is inputted to the input terminal 463 and
is superposed with the modulated video signal by an
adding circuit 464. This superposed signal is applied
to the magnetic heads 401-1, 4-1-2 via a recording
amplifier 442, a switch 465 and a rotary transformer
406, and is recorded on the magnetic tape. The
recording pattern is circulating from F1 to F4, as
shown in FIG. 13.Then the ordinary reproducing will now be described.Regarding the output of the reproducing
amplifier 443, a low-pass filter (hereinafter called
"LPF") 467 cancels video signal components and extracts
pilot signal components. The pilot signal components
extracted by the LPF 467 and the output of the
