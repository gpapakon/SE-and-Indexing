<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of the invention is to obtain a drive for a web-fed multi-colour rotary press whose performance is adaptable to the intended production capacity. This is obtained by the fact that in a plurality of superimposed printing mechanisms constituting printing units (7-18) each has a separate drive motor coupled via a clutch (27) and a gear (25) to an upright shaft (28). If a motor breaks down, the power can be taken via the drive of another printing mechanism.

Claims for the following Contracting States : CH, DE, FR, GB, LI
Drive for a multicolour web-fed rotary printing
machine, using a principal shaft and a plurality of

stationary shafts, having the following features:

a plurality of printing units (7 to 18) arranged
one above the other to form printing assemblies

(1; 2; 3) each have a separate drive motor (26)
which is connected by way of a coupling (27) and a

gear (25) to a stationary shaft (28; 29; 30),
both the printing assemblies (1; 2; 3), by way of
stationary shaft couplings (32 to 34), and folding

units (37; 38), driven by way of separate motors
(44), are connected to a longitudinal shaft (36),
an absolute-value generator (31) is associated
with each printing unit (7 to 18),
the motors (26) and stationary shafts (28; 29; 30)
are dimensioned such that these can supply the

output of a failed motor.
Drive according to claim 1, characterized in
that an absolute-value generator (31) is associated

with each folding unit (37; 38).
Drive according to Claim 1, characterized in
that absolute-value generators (50) are associated with

the longitudinal shaft (36).
Claims for the following Contracting States : IT, SE
A drive for a multicolour web-fed rotary printing machine,
using a principal shaft and a plurality of stationary shafts,

characterized in that a plurality of printing units (7 to 18)
arranged one above the other to form printing assemblies (1; 2;

3) each have a separate drive motor (26) which is connected by
way of a coupling (27) and a gear (25) to a stationary shaft (28;

29; 30), in that both the printing assemblies (1; 2; 3) are

A drive according to Claim 1 to 5, characterized in that the
motor (44) of the folding unit (37; 38) may be connected by way

of a stationary shaft coupling (39; 40) to the stationary shaft 
(42; 43).
A drive according to Claim 1 to 6, characterized in that an
inking unit (51; 53) and a damping unit (49; 52) may be driven

by the plate cylinder (23; 24).
