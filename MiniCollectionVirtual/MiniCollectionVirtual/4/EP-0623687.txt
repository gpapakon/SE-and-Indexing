<ABSTRACT>
The method forms a thin layer of metal mesh (14) on the 
surface (12) of the implant (10) for the bonding with a porous 

surface layer (16) to prevent the formation of notches within 

the body of the implant (10). The layer of metal mesh (14) can be 
formed by a number of known methods including conventional 

welding processes such as arc welding, resistance welding, 
electron beam welding, laser beam welding, friction 

welding, ultrasonic welding, cladding. The porous metal 
surface layer (16) is preferably formed from titanium wire or 

titanium beads in a known process. The porous surface 
layer (16) is bonded by a known process such as diffusion 

bonding, sintering, welding, or cladding. 
By bonding the porous surface layer (16) to the thin layer 
of metal mesh (14), notches normally formed in the body of the 

implant (10) are substantially eliminated. Therefore, the 
designer of the implant (10) is not limited as to the location 

and amount of porous surface layer (16) to be placed on the 
implants (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to prosthetic implant having a 
porous surface attached thereto and has specific relevance 
to a method of attaching a porous layer to an orthopaedic 
implant. Prosthetic implants for the replacement of a portion 
of a patient's joints are well known. Likewise, it is well 
known to provide a porous surface layer on the implant to 
promote the ingrowth of bone and enhance fixation of the 
implant within the bone. The porous surface layer may take 
the form of a plurality of small beads or a wire mesh. 
Commonly, the porous surface layer is sintered or diffusion 
bonded to the implant. Sintering or diffusion bonding 
requires that the implant and porous surface layer be 
heated to a temperature sufficient to cause the porous 
surface layer and implant body to fuse, melt, or bond 
together at their point of mutual contact. If the sintered 
or diffusion bonded junctions were viewed in cross section, 
a small notch would be seen extending into the implant on 
each side of a contact point between the porous surface 
layer and the implant. These notches decrease the 
mechanical strength of the implant. To compensate for the 
effect of the notches and maintain the strength of the 
implant above the minimum guidelines established by the FDA 
of 18.9 ksi, the prosthetic implant manufacturer designs 
the implant to ensure that the resultant strength is well 
above the established minimum after bonding. This may 
require the porous surface layer be limited only to areas 
of large cross sections to meet the design strength 
criterion. This may limit the manufacturer in the ability 
to place porous surface layers on smaller sized implants 
having smaller cross sections.  The method and implant of this invention solves the 
problems discussed above by creating a thin layer of metal 
mesh on the surface of the implant and the bonding the 
porous surface layer onto the mesh. The layer of metal 
mesh can be formed by a number of known methods including 
conventional welding processes such as arc welding, 
resistance welding, electron beam welding, laser beam 
welding, friction welding, ultrasonic welding, cladding. 
The thin layer of metal mesh is preferably formed from a 
beta titanium alloy. The porous metal surface layer is 
preferably formed from titanium wire or titanium beads in 
a known process. The porous surface layer is bonded by a 
known process such as diffusion bonding, sintering, 
welding, or cladding. By bonding the porous surface layer to the thin layer 
of metal mesh, notches
