<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pressure medium-operated brake device for rail vehicle formations with a main air line, by way of which both the pressure medium reservoirs for individual vehicles are filled and the pneumatic brake signals are transmitted, a control valve device being arranged on each individual vehicle, which in the event of a pressure drop in the main air line causes a delivery of pressure medium proportional to the size of the pressure drop, from the reservoir to the brake cylinder. According to the invention each control valve device (1) has a proportional control valve function and in addition electronic and/or electro-mechanical means (10, 11, ... 21), by means of which the pressure drop in the main air line (HL) can be measured, and an electrical actuating signal (Sb) can be generated for the delivery of pressure medium to the brake cylinder (3).
