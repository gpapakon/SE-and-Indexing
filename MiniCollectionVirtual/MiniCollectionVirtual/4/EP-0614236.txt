<ABSTRACT>
In a method for producing a multi-component 
hydrogen storage alloy including metals of zirconium or 

vanadium, oxides of these metals is used to produce an 

alloy having characteristics equivalent to that produced 
with pure metals. It comprises steps of calcining the raw 

material, wherein at least one selected from the group 
consisting of zirconium and vanadium is included in its 

oxide form, at a temperature ranging from 900°C to 1300°C, 
mixing metal calcium with said calcined raw material, and 

treating the mixture with heat at a temperature ranging 
from the melting point of metal calcium to 1300°C, under 

inert gas atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
a multi-component hydrogen storage alloy which can
electrochemically absorb and desorb hydrogen in a
reversible manner.Storage batteries, which are widely used as
power sources in a variety of applications, are typically
classified into two general groups of lead-acid storage
batteries and alkaline storage batteries. Between the two
groups, alkaline storage batteries tend to be more
reliable, and can be made smaller and lighter. Small
alkaline storage batteries are generally favored for
portable electric appliances, while large alkaline storage
batteries have been used mainly in conjunction with
industrial equipments.While some alkaline storage batteries use air or
silver oxide for their positive electrode material,
majority of the positive electrodes are of nickel. Nickel
electrodes have been particularly popular since they were
reconfigured from a pocket type to a sintered type, and 
became even more popular with the development of hermetic-sealing.Cadmium is most commonly used to form the
negative electrode of alkaline storage batteries, however
other materials, including zinc, iron, hydrogen, and the
like have also been employed.There is considerable commercial interest in
storage batteries that have a higher energy density than
batteries currently available. Toward achieving this
goal, researchers have investigated nickel-based hydrogen
storage batteries which comprise hydrogen storage
electrodes. A number of proposals have been made on the
production method of the hydrogen storage electrodes using
metal hydrides.The alloys in these electrodes, or the hydride
formsof such alloys, can absorb and desorb hydrogen in a
reversible manner, and thus the alloys and the electrodes
made from these alloys have come to be known as hydrogen
storage alloys and hydrogen storage electrodes (or
hydrogen storage alloy electrodes), respectively.Batteries made with hydrogen storage electrodes
have a larger theoretical energy density in comparison
with batteries formed with cadmium electrodes. Also,
batteries employing hydrogen storage electrodes are not
susceptible to the formation and subsequent deformation of
dendrites, which is a problem with zinc electrodes. These 
advantageous properties, as well as the promise for a
longer cycle life and a reduction in the environmental
concerns inherent in zinc- or cadmium- containing
electrodes/batteries, have encouraged research into
developing alloys suited for hydrogen storage electrodes,
