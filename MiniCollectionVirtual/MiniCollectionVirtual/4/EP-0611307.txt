<ABSTRACT>
For the purpose of sterilization and/or disinfection, a surface is exposed to a stream of nitrogen and/or argon plasma and relative movement is caused between the surface and a zone of the plasma stream acting upon the surface, the relative movement taking place at a speed between 0.6 and 1.5 m/s.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the treatment of surfaces, 
and, in particular, although not exclusively, it has 
application in the treatment of the surfaces of medical 
equipment. The invention may, for example, be used for 
the sterilization and/or the disinfection of both medical 
instruments and accessories. Known in the art is a method for the sterilization 
and the disinfection of medical equipment which includes 
the step of treating the equipment at a high-temperature 
in special chambers (at 200Â° C); see V.I. Vashkov. 
"Equipment and Methods for Sterilization in Medicine" (in 
Russian). M., M. 1973, pp. 271; 269-297. It is also known to sterilize and disinfect the 
surfaces of medical equipment by acting upon the surface 
physically under atmospheric pressure; see M.A. 
Tumanyan, D.A. Kaushansky. "Radiation Sterilization". 
M., M. 1974. pp. 139-165. It should be noted that the above prior art methods 
are characterised by the need for a long treatment time 
(up to several hours) and that they cannot ensure a high 
quality of sterilization and disinfection. The use of a 
method according to the invention results in both a 
substantial decrease in treatment time (to fractions of a 
second) and a high quality of treatment. These results are accomplished, in one particular  
 
method, by acting upon a surface with a stream of 
nitrogen and/or argon plasma and by causing there to be 
relative movement between the surface to be treated and a 
zone of the plasma stream acting upon the surface, the 
relative movement taking place at least once at a speed 
between 0.6 and 1.5 m/s. A method according to the invention which will now 
be described, by way of example, is carried out in the 
following manner. A surface of medical equipment to be 
treated is subjected to a dynamic plasma treatment with 
an incoming relatively stationary plasma stream having an 
enthalpy of braking 1>10 J/kg under non-stationary 
heating conditions provided by causing the surface being 
treated to pass through the plasma stream with 
Ti,a= Ts< Ta, wherein Ti,a are the temperatures of ion and 
neutral components of the plasma stream and the surface 
being treated respectively; Ts is the temperature of the 
surface being treated; Ta, is the admissible temperature 
of heating of the surface being treated; USSR Inventor's 
Certificate No. 1457732, H 01 L 21/306, 1987. The 
treatment is carried out with a stream of nitrogen and/or 
argon plasma. The surface being treated is caused to 
pass through a zone of the plasma stream at least

<CLAIMS>
A method for use in the treatment of a surface which 
is suitable for the purpose of sterilization and/or disinfection, 

in which the surface is acted upon by means 
providing a physical treatment, characterised in that the 

treatment includes the steps of exposing the surface to a 
stream of nitrogen and/or argon plasma, and causing 

relative movement between the surface to be treated and a 
zone of the plasma stream as it acts upon the surface, 

the relative movement taking place at a speed between 0.6 
and 1.5 m/s. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the relative 
movement is between the surface and a plurality of plasma 

streams. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims in which the surface is moved and the plasma 

stream or streams is/are maintained relatively 
stationary. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims in which the relative movement takes place more 

than once.
