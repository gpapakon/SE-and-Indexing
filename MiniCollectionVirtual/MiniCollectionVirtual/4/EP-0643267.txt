<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at eliminating from a fuel-air premixing nozzle-carrying combustor the inconveniences, 
such as variation of flame length which is ascribed to variation of combustion rate due to variation of fuel concentration 

in a premixed gas; and the occurrence of combustion vibration. The present invention provides a combustion method 
in which a non-fuel-containing fluid (8) is supplied to a space between a premixed gas layer (2) formed by a premixed 

gas ejected from a premixing nozzle (1) and a high-temperature gas layer (5) formed by a part of a high temperature 
gas occurring due to the combustion of the premixed gas, which part of the high-temperature gas is circulated or reside 

in a downstream zone at an outlet portion of the premixing nozzle; and a combustor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the combustion
of a premixed gas in a combustor having a fuel-air premixing
nozzle and useful for effecting low-NOx combustion and a combustor
therefor. This invention can be applied to such combustors
as gas turbine combustors, boilers, and furnaces for
use in chemical industry.Recently, in order to reduce the NOx content of exhaust
gas from gas turbine combustors and the like, there is commonly
employed a combustion method in which fuel is premixed
with combustion air and the resulting premixed gas is burned
under lean combustion conditions. This method for the combustion
of a premixed gas can eliminate areas having uneven fuel
concentrations and also local areas burning at higher temperatures,
resulting in a marked reduction in the amount of
NOx produced.FIG. 3 illustrates a part of a burner based on the
conventional method for the combustion of a premixed gas. In
this figure, reference numeral 1 designates a premixing nozzle,
2 designates a premixed gas, 3 designates a flame
holder, 4 designates a flame, 5 designates a circulating or
staying hot gas, 6 designates a pilot nozzle, and 7 designates
a pilot fuel.The premixed gas 2 injected through the premixing nozzle
1 into the combustion chamber burns so as to go round the
flame holder 3, thus forming downstream a circulating hot gas
5 serving for flame holding.In this method for the combustion of a premixed gas,
the combustion rate of the premixed gas (i.e., the velocity
at which the flame advances into the unburned mixture) becomes
higher as the temperature of the premixed gas is elevated
and as the fuel concentration of the premixed gas is 
increased. In particular, the fuel concentration may cause
marked variation in the resulting combustion rate. Such
variation in combustion rate causes variation in flame length
and may eventually lead to the development of combustive vibration.From US-Patent 4,373,325, a combustor, primarily for a
gas turbine which employs swirl flame stabilization is known.
Vortex induced centrifugal forces and hot gas recirculation
are employed for flame stabilization. The dual stage combustor
operates in two modes, stable fuel air strata mode and
low emission mode. The combustor comprises a cylindrical,
elongated casing which has an upstream section and a downstream
section connected by a radially extending transition
section, and a liquid fuel injector concentrically disposed
in the upstream casing section. The injector and the upstream
casing section form an annular combustion air

<CLAIMS>
A method for minimizing combustive vibration in the combustion
of a premixed gas (2) in a combustor having a fuel-air

premixing nozzle (1) which has a flame holder (3) for holding a
flame, said method comprising feeding a fluid (8) containing no

fuel between a premixed gas layer formed by injecting said premixed
gas through said premixing nozzle and a circulating hot

gas (5) formed as a result of the combustion of said premixed
gas, and directing the fluid (8) to flow out along a wall surface

of the flame holder, whereby the hot gas forms a circulating
flow in a region downstream of the outlet of said premixing

nozzle.
A combustor comprising:

a pilot nozzle (6);
a fuel-air premixing nozzle (1) for injecting a premixed
fuel-air gas (2) which is disposed around the pilot nozzle coaxially

with the pilot nozzle;
a flame holder (3) disposed at the outlet of the fuel-air
premixing nozzle to hold a flame; and
a passage for feeding a fluid (8) containing no fuel which
is disposed between the pilot nozzle and the fuel-air premixing

nozzle, wherein said passage is arranged so as to direct the
fluid (8) to flow out along a wall surface of the flame holder

(3) so that said fluid flows between the premixed fuel-air gas

(2) and a circulating hot gas (5) formed as a result of the
combustion of the premixed gas, wherein the circulating hot gas

(5) forms a circulating flow in a region downstream of the outlet
of the premixing nozzle (1).
