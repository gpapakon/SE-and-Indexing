<ABSTRACT>
The chlorination of paraffins is carried out in the presence of water and in the absence of a solvent. In this way, it is possible to prepare highly chlorinated paraffins in a simple manner. The presence of hydrochloric acid causes no losses of quality even at high temperatures. The separation of the chloroparaffin from the hydrochloric acid is very good. An emulsion layer preventing the transport of the chloroparaffin into downstream equipment does not occur.

A process for preparing a C
14
-C
40
 chlorinated
paraffin having a chlorine content of more than 60% by weight

from a C
14
-C
40
 paraffin reactant being a saturated or
unsaturated hydrocarbon which can already contain chlorine

atoms, said process comprising:

reacting the C
14
-C
40
 paraffin reactant with an amount of
liquid chlorine which reacts completely with the

paraffin to form a chlorinated paraffin phase of said
C
14
-C
40
 chlorinated paraffin having a chlorine content of
more than 60% by weight, under a pressure of up to 10

bar in the absence of an organic solvent at an elevated
temperature ranging from 75°C up to 140°C, in the

presence of a free radical source, said C
14
-C
40
 paraffin
being in intimate mixture with an aqueous phase, the

intimate mixture being maintained by stirring, said
reacting being continued until a chlorinated paraffin

phase and an aqueous hydrochloric acid phase have been
formed, and
separating said chlorinated paraffin phase from said aqueous
phase, wherein said separating step is carried out by

cessation of said stirring.
The process according to claim 1, wherein said C
14
-C
40

paraffin reactant is saturated. 
The process according to claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein said C
14
-C
40
 paraffin reactant has been
prechlorinated.
The process according to any of claims 1 to 3,
there being used as aqueous phase dilute hydrochloric acid.
The process according to any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein said stirring is carried out with an impeller

stirrer.
The process according to any of claims 1 to 5,
wherein said pressure ranges from 2 to 6 bar.
The process according to any of claims 1 to 6,

wherein said aqueous phase is present in an amount sufficient
to absorb the hydrogen chloride formed during the reaction,

or to form a dilute hydrochloric acid having a strength of
from 29% (m/m) to 35% (m/m).
A process for preparing highly chlorinated
paraffins having a chlorine content of more than 60% by

weight at a temperature of from 75 to 140°C and a pressure of
up to 10 bar by reacting a C
14
-C
40
 paraffin being a saturated
or unsaturated hydrocarbon which can already contain chlorine

atoms with liquid chlorine, wherein

the chlorine reacts completely, the reaction is
carried out in the presence of an amount of water 

such that during chlorination there is formed
hydrochloric acid having a strength of from 29%

(m/m) to 35% (m/m), in the presence of a free-radical
source and in the absence of an organic

solvent.
