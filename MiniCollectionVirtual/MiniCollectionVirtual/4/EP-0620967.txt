<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a drainage pipe with 
perforations for draining whey from a whey/curd mass, in 

which the perforations are formed by small holes, and the 
hole size lies within the range 0.05 - 3 mm, while the hole 

density lies within the range 5 - 50,000 holes/cm². 
Such a pipe is used in the preparation of cheese. 
In a drainage pipe which is provided with a large 
number of small holes, a larger part of the surface can be 

perforated, with the result that the drainage is more 
efficient. 
 
A natural counterpressure can be built up by 
varying the hole size and the hole density over the surface 

of the pipe, thus making expensive facilities for 
regulating the counterpressure unnecessary. 
The hole size and/or hole density can be varied in 
such a way over the surface of the pipe that the open 

surface increases from top to bottom. Various grid patterns 
are described for this. 
If the pipe is made of plastic, the full circumference 
of the pipe can be provided with holes, with the 

result that the full surface of the pipe is available for 
drainage. 
The invention also relates to a device which is 
provided with at least one drainage pipe of the type 

according to the invention and to methods for manufacturing 
such a drainage pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a drainage pipe with 
perforations for draining whey from a whey/curd mass. Such a drainage pipe is known from Dutch Patent 
Application 8802715. In the preparation of cheese, milk is heated up to 
approximately 30°C, enzymes and a lactic acid bacterial 
culture are then added, following which the milk becomes 
unstable. Within a short time the liquid milk changes into 
a cuttable mass, a smooth gel which is cut into pieces. 
Interaction between the protein chains present causes the 
pieces to shrink and spontaneously expel moisture, a 
process known as syneresis. The moisture released - a 
cloudy, pale green liquid - is the whey. Some of the whey is drained off, and the curd (i.e. 
the solids from which most of the whey has already been 
removed) is then guided through a drainage device. The curd 
blocks thus produced are placed some time later in a cheese 
vat and pressed. The known drainage device is provided with one or 
more stainless steel perforated drainage pipes. It is 
vitally important that the whey should be drained from the 
whey/curd mass in a controlled manner. Poor drainage of the 
curd can cause quality problems. For instance, cracks in 
the curd block can give rise to mould. If whey flows out 
too quickly, curd is entrained against the perforations and 
thus can block or clog those perforations. In the case of the known drainage device, the 
drainage is limited by a liquid pressure gradient in the 
discharge for the whey. The outflow of whey is regulated by 
placing a mechanical barrier, with the result that a liquid 
counterpressure is created. When the level of the liquid 
counterpressure is set, the outflow velocity of the whey is 
controlled. Counterpressure is important particularly in 
the case of pipes with a diameter greater than 150 mm.  However, such a system cannot be controlled 
accurately, because the flowability through the curd can 
differ from place to place by a factor of 1000. However, 
such accurate setting and variation of the liquid counter-pressure 
is not possible. For that reason, caution is 
exercised, and very low limit values are selected, so that 
ultimately too much whey remains in the curd block. Another control system is that in which the outflow 
of the whey is controlled by a valve. In this case the 
control is directed towards a quantity of whey, and not 
towards a predetermined liquid counterpressure. Such a 
solution is known, for example, from a thesis by 
J.C. Akkerman, entitled "Drainage of curd", L.U. 
Wageningen, 1992. A
