<ABSTRACT>
The Switching Methods for a Satellite Communication System overcome the limitations encountered by conventional packet switching using virtual circuits. The present invention utilizes a ''datagram'' approach that routes every packet (22) conveyed by the system independently at every node in the network. The packets (22) are directed along an optimized pathway through the network by a fast packet switch (38) that directs traffic based on instructions from an adaptive routing processor (14) that continuously runs an adaptive routing algorithm (16). This adaptive routing processor (14) works together with an input packet processor (28) and a routing cache memory (20) to monitor the rapidly changing topology of each satellite (S) in the constellation and the distribution of traffic among its nodes and links. The input packet processor (28) functions like a gatekeeper or guide that extracts the destination node address (32) from each packet (22) and uses it to access routing information stored in the routing cache memory (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present patent application is related to the
following co-pending patent applications:
WO 93/09613 - Satellite Communication System;WO 93/09577 - Terrestrial Antennas for Satellite
Communication System;WO 93/09614 - Beam Compensation Methods for Satellite
Communication System;WO 93/09578 - Spacecraft Antennas & Beam Steering
Methods for Satellite Communication System;WO 93/09029 - Spacecraft Designs for Satellite
Communication System.The present invention relates to the field of satellite communications. More particularly,
this invention provides a novel fast packet switching method for a network having a rapidly changing
topology. Each packet moved through the network is routed independently at each network node
along an optimum route that is selected by the switch.A portion of long-distance telephone traffic is relayed by satellite networks. Some of the
radio signals that convey these telephone calls are grouped into sequences of digital bits called
"packets." In conventional packet networks are carried to their destination through a pathway called
a "virtual circuit." A virtual circuit is a route through a network from an origin to a destination that
is established at the initiation of a call, and then is released when the call is terminated. The virtual
circuit defines a path that includes nodes and links in the network that are used by all the packets
associated with the virtual circuit. The packets arrive at their destinations by following instructions
or maps that are generated at the origin of the call. Any change in network topology after the call
is initiated and the packet itinerary is generated, such as the failure of a node or link, causes a
discontinuity in the virtual circuit. When the virtual circuit is disturbed, the packet's itinerary is no
longer valid, and the call is disconnected. Re-establishing a broken call by generating a new virtual
circuit every time a failure occurs is a lengthy, inefficient and expensive process.Conventional systems that employ packets that are switched through virtual circuits are
capable of providing reliable communications service in networks that are static. If the nodes and
the links connecting the nodes are dynamic, the use of packets that follow directions along a fixed
itinerary in a virtual circuit that was mapped at the origin of the call becomes impractical. A
satellite communications system that utilizes satellites in geosynchronous orbit is generally a static
system, since the spacecraft do not change position appreciably relative to relay
