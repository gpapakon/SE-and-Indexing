<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an amplifier comprising a
differential amplifier using MOS gate capacitors, according to
the opening portion of claim 1.A differential amplifier such as known from US-A-4 553 052 to
which input signals are supplied via capacitors precharged to
predetermined potentials is generally called a chopper type
differential amplifier. Since the amplitude of the input
signals can be taken large in the chopper type differential
amplifier, it is used widely in A/D converter or the like.
In
order to simplify the manufacturing process, the so-called MOS
gate capacitor in which the transistor structure is employed
as a capacitor to receive the input signal, has been used in
the past. This kind of chopper type differential amplifier
will be described by making reference to FIG. 1. The lower
electrode side of a MOS gate capacitor CG1 is supplied with
an input signal VI(+), and the gate electrode side of CG1 is
connected to one of 
the input ends (noninverting input side) 2 of a differential
amplifier 1. Similarly, the lower electrode side of a MOS
gate capacitor CG2 is supplied with an input signal VI(-),
and the gate electrode side of CG2 is connected to the
other input end (inverting input side) 3 of the differential
amplifier 1. The input ends 2 and 3 of the differential
amplifier 1 are connected to a precharging circuit 40
which precharges both input ends 2 and 3 to a potential
of Vdd/2 during the precharging period.The precharging circuit 40 comprises N-channel MOS-FETs
QN31 and QN32 whose gate electrodes receive a sampling
signal S31, drain electrodes are connected to a precharging
voltage terminal 4 and source electrodes are connected to
the input terminal 2 and the input terminal 3, respectively,
of the differential amplifier 1, and P-channel MOS-FETs
QP31 and QP32 whose gate electrodes receive a sampling
signal S32, drain electrodes are connected to the precharging
voltage terminal 4 and source electrodes are connected to
the input end 2 and the input end 3, respectively, of
the differential amplifier 1. The precharging voltage
terminal 4 is provided with a voltage of VDD/2 in contrast
to the power supply voltage Vdd supplied to the differential
amplifier 1 via a power supply voltage terminal 6.The reason for using Vdd/2 as the precharging voltage
is as described below. If the precharging voltage is
chosen to be Vdd, then the voltage of the input end 2 or 3 
of the differential amplifier 1 will be raised to beyond
Vdd in response to the changes in the input signal. What
