<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and a system for data transmission on the power supply for an integrated memory circuit. This circuit includes a clock (46) which make it possible to generate fixed-frequency current signals superimposed on the power supply current. These signals are pulse-width modulated on the basis of the data to be sent to the read/write system. The latter in its turn generates voltage signals on the power supply which are synchronised with the current signals, and with a phase corresponding to the data to be sent to the integrated circuit.

Method for serial data transmission between an integrated memory circuit and
external reading/writing means supplying a supply current to the integrated circuit,

data being transmitted from said reading/writing means to the integrated circuit by
superimposing voltage pulses (30) to the supply voltage, data being transmitted

from the integrated circuit to the reading/writing means by modulation of the
current consumed by the integrated circuit

is enabled by connecting a mobile element (65) to the integrated circuit, that the
integrated circuit is driven by an internal clock (1) synchronizing the generation of

output signals (X,Y,Z) corresponding to data to be transmitted in the form of
supply current modulations, that the reading/writing means and the supply current

are synchronized by a synchronization circuit (68), that the reading/writing means
form input signals (Ia) corresponding to data to be transmitted, and that said input

signals (Ia) and the current modulations are synchronized.

Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the power supply of the
integrated circuit, as well as the data transmission between the latter and an

external reading/writing system takes place by means of a carrier frequency,

carrier frequency being transmitted via a transmitting coil to a receiving coil, the
signal at the output of the latter being previously rectified and filtered before

being applied to the supply terminals of the integrated circuit.
