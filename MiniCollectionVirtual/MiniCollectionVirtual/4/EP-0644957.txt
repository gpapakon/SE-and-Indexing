<ABSTRACT>
In processes of the production of thermoplastic polymer yarns, a process for controlling slippage of yarn on rolls across which there is a tension change. The yarn is advanced along pairs of rolls with the yarn contacting the rolls in successive wraps. At least one of the rolls is driven and has a changing diameter as the yarn advances between at least two of the successive wraps. The wraps contact the contact areas on the surface of the driven roll to each define a total wrap angle for the wrap. The number of wraps is selected and the diameter of the driven roll at the contact areas is selected to increase or decrease the tension while preventing a wrap angle in creep for any one of the wraps from being greater than about 90 % of the total wrap angle for the wrap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes 
for the production of thermoplastic polymer yarns and 
more particularly relates to manufacturing processes 
which produce highly uniform thermoplastic polymer 
yarns. In the production of many synthetic 
thermoplastic polymer yarns which are melt spun, at 
least one drawing step is either coupled with or 
performed as a separate step in the manufacturing 
process. The drawing of the yarns to impart 
orientation and thereby reduce residual elongation and 
increase tensile strength requires, in most cases, that 
the yarn be subjected to a significant tension. Usually for such drawing, the yarn is 
advanced in a draw zone between sets of rotating rolls 
including feed rolls and subsequent draw rolls which 
are rotated at a higher peripheral speed than the feed 
rolls to impart the desired tension on the yarn. 
However, because the yarn which is advancing to the 
feed rolls is usually at a much lower tension than the 
tension in the draw zone, at least some slippage 
frequently occurs on the feed rolls and sometimes the 
draw begins to occur on the rolls. It has been 
discovered that this slippage and the drawing on the 
feed rolls can cause variations in the yarn and can 
affect the suitability of the yarns for end use 
applications such as in fabrics which are dyed with 
structure sensitive reactive dyes. When such dyes are 
used, otherwise undetectable variations in the yarns 
can be responsible for highly visible non-uniformity in 
fabric dyeing.  
 It has also been discovered that the decrease 
in tension across a roll set also can cause a non-uniform 
yarn to be produced due to slippage. This can 
occur in a wide variety of yarn processes when the 
tension on the yarn decreases substantially across a 
roll set. For example, when the yarn leaves a draw 
zone in a drawing step, tension is often substantially 
reduced. Similarly, in extremely high speed spinning 
process without a draw step in which the yarn is 
withdrawn from a spinneret at a speed to impart a high 
degree of spin orientation, the tension on the yarn can 
be very substantial and can be too high for the winding 
up of good packages. A tension let-down step may be 
necessary before windup. Various techniques are known for preventing 
slippage on rolls when a tension change is occurring 
but known techniques generally introduce additional 
problems. For example, a pinch roll with a softer 
surface is known for use as disclosed in U.S. Pat. 
2,413,073 to control tension induced slippage.
