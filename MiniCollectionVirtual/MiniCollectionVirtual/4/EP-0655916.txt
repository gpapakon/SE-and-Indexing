Means for transdermal administration, characterised in that it contains 3-keto-desogestrel
optionally in combination with one or more oestrogen(s).
Means for transdermal administration according to patent claim 1, characterised
in that as oestrogen(s) there are used oestradiol, oestriol, 17α-ethynyloestradiol,

mestranol, 14α,17α-ethano-oestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3β,17α-diol, 14α,17α-ethano-oestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3β,16α,17α-triol
or esters of those compounds.
Means for transdermal administration according to patent claim 1 and 2,
characterised in that the means is a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS).
Means for transdermal administration according to patent claim 3, characterised
in that the transdermal therapeutic system consists of


a) an impermeable cover layer,

from one to three matrix layer(s) that adhere to the cover layer, that contain the
3-keto-desogestrel, optionally the oestrogen(s) and, if desired, penetration-enhancing

agents and that are permeable to those components and are self-adhesive
or are covered or surrounded by a skin adhesive which may, if desired,

contain penetration-enhancing agents, and a removable protective layer, or
b) a covering provided with an adhesive which may, if desired, contain penetration-enhancing
agents,

from one to three matrix layers(s) that (each) leave an adhesive border area
uncovered, that are attached to the adhesive by means of an impermeable

covering and that contain the 3-keto-desogestrel, optionally the oestrogen(s)
and penetration-enhancing agents, and a removable protective layer, or
c) an impermeable cover layer,

from one to three medicament reservoir(s) that are located on or in the cover
layer and that contain the 3-keto-desogestrel, optionally the oestrogen(s) and, if

desired, penetration-enhancing agents,
 
from one to three polymer layer(s) permeable to those components,

a permeable skin adhesive layer that optionally contains penetration-enhancing
agents, and a removable protective layer.
Means for transdermal administration according to patent claim 4, characterised
in that it contains an active-ingredient-containing matrix layer or a medicament

reservoir.
Means for transdermal administration according to patent claim 4, characterised
in that it contains two or three active-ingredient-containing matrix layers or

medicament reservoirs.
Means for transdermal administration according to patent claim 6, characterised
in that the ac
tive-ingredient-containing matrix layers or the medicament reservoirs
contain different active ingredients.
Use of 3-keto-desogestrel optionally in combination with one or more
oestrogen(s) in the preparation of a means for the transdermal administration of the

active ingredient or active ingredient mixture.
Use of 3-keto-desogestrel in combination with one or more oestrogen(s) in the
preparation of a means according to patent claim 8, characterised in that there are

used as oestrogen(s) oestradiol, oestriol, 17α-ethynyloestradiol, mestranol, 14α,17α-ethano-oestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3β,17α-diol,
14α,17α-ethano-oestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3β,16α,17α-trio

or esters of those compounds.
Use of 3-keto-desogestrel optionally in combination with one or more
oestrogen(s) in the preparation of a means according to patent claim 8 and 9,

characterised in that the means is a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS).
Use of 3-keto-desogestrel optionally in combination with one or more
oestrogen(s) in the preparation of a means according to patent claim 10,

characterised in that it is a transdermal therapeutic system according to patent claim
4 to 7. 
Use of 3-keto-desogestrel in the preparation of an oestrogen-free means
according to patent claim 1 to 7 in the preparation of a transdermal therapeutic

system (TTS), for the purpose of contraception, for the treatment (a) of endometriosis,
(b) of gestagen-dependent tumours and (c) of pre-menstrual syndrome

and (d) for the purpose of menstrual cycle regulation.
Use of 3-keto-desogestrel in the preparation of a means according to patent
claim 1 to 7 in the preparation of a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) for the

purpose of contraception, for the treatment (a) of climacteric complaints, (b) in the
prevention of osteoporosis, (c) for the purpose of menstrual cycle regulation and (d)

for the purpose of menstrual cycle stabilisation.
