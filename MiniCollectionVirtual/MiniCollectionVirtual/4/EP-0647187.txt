<DESCRIPTION>
 "gogta1_Broduet" .The present invention is a novel postal product which is a means for enabling a greeting or gift to be despatched by post.It is frequently desired to send at short notice a greeting or gift by post. For example, it may be desired to send a birthday card or gift with little time remaining in which to send it, or to send a10 greeting or gift on impulse, such as when the sender is on holiday or otherwise away from home. However such sending by post inevitably entails purchasing one or more postage stamps. Such stamps are usually15 available from only a strictly limited number of outlets since they are a valuable commodity of which sales must be controlled. If all such outlets are closed at the relevant time, then it may be impossible toSUBSTITUTESHEET 

 send the greeting or gift. If a newsagent or other retailer authorised to sell postage stamps happens to be open when a stamp is required, it is nonetheless 5 usually necessary to buy several stamps, for example a book of stamps. Alternatively, it may be necessary to purchase one or more stamps at a post office, in which case buying even one10 stamps may entail undesirable waiting to be served, among customers conducting more time-consuming business.It is an object of the present invention to provide a means of overcoming15 some at least of the foregoing problems, in the form of a novel postal product.The postal product according to the present invention comprises a greeting card or gift, an envelope or other container for20 enclosing the card or gift when sending it by post,- which envelope or other container bears an indication authorising or confirming a charge for its carriage by post, and an outer wrapper containing25 sealed therein said card or gift and said envelope or other container.As can readily be appreciated, the postal product of the present inventionSUBSTITUTESHEET 

provides the purchaser with all that is required to send the card or gift by post without the need to find an outlet selling stamps which is both accessible and open and thereby avoiding the chore and potential delay which would otherwise be entailed.
