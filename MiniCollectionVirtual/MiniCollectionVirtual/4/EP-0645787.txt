<ABSTRACT>
The device includes at least two coils (4, 5, 6) having substantially orthogonal axes, fed with electric current, each coil extending along its axial direction over at least a substantial part of a central treatment region (9), the coils thus being imbricated into one another, and configured in such a way that some parts (52) of their turns are deformable or deformed in order to be able to place the said object freely in the treatment region, or to withdraw it therefrom. In order to magnetise or de-magnetise the object (1), each of the coils is fed successively, in such a way as to create two tangential magnetic fields in perpendicular directions successively on all the faces of the object, or the coils are fed simultaneously by a periodic electric current phase-shifted by 120 DEG  from one coil to the other, in such a way as to create a rotating or oscillating field on all the faces of the object. Application particularly to non-destructive testing, in particular by magnetoscopy.
