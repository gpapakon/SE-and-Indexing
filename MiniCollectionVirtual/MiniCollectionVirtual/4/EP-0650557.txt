<ABSTRACT>
The plasma motor comprises a primary ionization and acceleration annular canal (24) delimited by parts (22) made of insulating material and open at its downstream end (225), at least one hollow cathode (40) associated with means (41) for supplying gas capable of being ionized, and an annular anode (25) concentric with said main annular canal (24) and placed at a distance from the open downstream end (225). An annular buffer chamber (24) which has, radially, a larger size than that of the main annular canal (24) extends upstream of the latter beyond the area in which is placed the annular anode (25). Means (26) for supplying gas capable of being ionized open upstream of the anode (25) through an annular distributor (27) into an area separated from the area carrying the anode (25). Means (31 to 33, 34 to 38) for creating a magnetic field in the main canal (24) are adapted to produce in said main canal (24) an essentially radial magnetic field having a gradient with maximum induction at the downstream end (225) of said canal (24).
