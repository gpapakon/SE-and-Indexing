<ABSTRACT>
An amplifier having an automatic threshold 
control circuit (ATC, 10) and a limiting amplifier 

(40). The ATC (10) detects and holds a top value 

(peak value) and bottom value of an input signal, 
and outputs the middle value between the top and 

bottom values as a reference voltage. The limiting 
amplifier (40) amplifies the input signal in a 

linear operating region whose center is set at the 
reference voltage, thereby maintaining the output 

amplitude at a constant value. Even if the 
amplitude and the level of the input signals 

instantaneously changes by a large amount, the ATC 
can follow the change, so that the offset 

compensation and gain compensation of the amplifier 
can be achieved instantaneously. This makes it 

possible to continue producing the output of a 
constant amplitude with little phase deviations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an amplifier
for an optical receiver circuit, and particularly to
an amplifier which can stably maintain a constant
output amplitude by automatically and
instantaneously controlling offset voltage and gain
in response to wide range changes in an input
signal.Amplifiers are essential in an optical digital
communications system for amplifying an attenuated
signal in an optical receiver circuit, or for
generating a stable clock signal by extracting a
timing signal from input data by using a timing
signal recovery circuit. These amplifiers are
required to have a large gain, a wide dynamic range
for an input signal, and a constant output
amplitude.In an optical receiver circuit for an optical
digital communications system as shown in Fig. 1, an
optical signal is first converted into a current
signal by a photodiode. Subsequently, the current
signal is converted into a voltage signal, and then,
amplified by an amplifier to a voltage amplitude, at
which the logic levels can be identified. In 
addition, the voltage amplitude of the output signal
must be maintained constant by automatically
controlling the offset voltage and gain of the
amplifier even if the input signal changes its
level. A conventional amplifier implements these
functions by combining a variable gain amplifier and
a DC feedback circuit.Recently, introduction of an optical
communications system that handles a burst mode data
signals of various signal levels has been studied.
The optical receiver circuit of such a system
strongly requires an amplifier that can maintain a
constant output amplitude by instantaneously
controlling the offset voltage and gain.The conventional amplifier, however, has a
problem in that it is slow in response because of a
feedback loop, and cannot follow changes in the
input signal. This problem will be explained in
detail referring to Fig. 2 showing a conventional
optical receiver circuit.In this figure, the intensity of an optical
signal is converted into a current by a photodiode
1, and the current signal produced from the
photodiode 1 is amplified and converted into a
voltage signal by a preamplifier 2. The voltage
output from the preamplifier 2 is further amplified
and converted into an output voltage of a fixed
amplitude by a voltage amplifier 3 which
automatically performs the offset compensation and
the gain control. The output voltage of a fixed
amplitude is produced from the output terminal To.The offset compensation refers to a function
which is achieved by providing the DC
