<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystalline polyester having a liquid crystal orientation in
glass phase, which is easy to fix, which exhibits a large
wavelength dispersion of birefringence and which is suitable for
application to an optical element.Recently, as to liquid crystalline polymers,
research and development have been made actively in the
field of high-performance materials utilizing high heat
resistance and moldability or in the field of functional
materials utilizing changes in liquid crystal structure
caused by heat or by an external field such as an electric
field and also utilizing the fixing of phase. Particularly,
in the field of high-performance materials,
commercialization has already been achieved. On the other
hand, in the field of functional materials, although
research has actively been directed towards attaining the
application of such polymers in optical recording, nonlinear
optical materials, alignment films for crystals,
optical fibers and optical elements for liquid crystal
displays, commercialization has not been achieved yet. In
the case of application of liquid crystalline polymers to
functional materials, the application can be broadly
classified into one which utilizes a dynamic change in phase
transition of liquid crystal and one in which a molecular
orientation peculiar to liquid crystal is fixed for
utilization as a static element. 
In both such applications, most uses employ optical
properties of liquid crystal. In connection with the latter
application just mentioned above, as important conditions
required for liquid crystalline polymers capable of having
liquid crystal orientations fixed and which are
applicable to optical elements, there are mentioned conditions such that
the fixing of liquid crystal orientation should be easy, the
liquid crystal orientation after fixing should be stable,
and optical properties such as refractive index,
birefringence and wavelength dispersion should be freely
controllable. Particularly, if an optical element
exhibiting a large wavelength dispersion of birefringence,
for which there has been a great demand recently in the
display field, can be produced using a liquid crystalline
polymer, it becomes possible to obtain an epoch-making
optical element in combination with properties for polarized
light peculiar to a fixed structure of liquid crystal
orientation.However, a liquid crystalline polymer exhibiting a
large wavelength dispersion of birefringence and capable of
having its liquid crystal orientation fixed stably and
