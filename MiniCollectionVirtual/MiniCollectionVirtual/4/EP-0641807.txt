<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel olefin
polymerization catalysts and processes for preparing
polypropylenes and propylene block copolymers using the
novel catalysts. The present invention also relates to
processes for preparing propylene block copolymers using
specific olefin polymerization catalysts.The polypropylene according to the present invention
has a high isotacticity. The propylene block copolymer
according to the present invention contains a polypropylene
component having a high isotacticity and a rubber component
having a high intrinsic viscosity [η].There have been known homopolypropylenes generally
having excellent rigidity and heat resistance, and
propylene block copolymers comprising both a polypropylene
component and a rubber component and having excellent
rigidity and heat resistance as well as excellent impact
resistance.Propylene polymers have also a low specific gravity
and can be easily recycled, and therefore they have been
paid much attention with respect to environmental 
protection and are now desired to be more extensively
utilized.Such propylene polymers are prepared using so-called a
Ziegler-Natta catalyst comprising a compound containing a
transition metal of Group IV to VI of the periodic table
and an organometallic compound containing a metal of Group
I to III, and they are widely used.However, the propylene polymers obtained by the prior
art techniques have not always sufficient rigidity and heat
resistance in some uses, so that they have limited uses for
some purposes.It is known that the rigidity and the heat resistance
of propylene polymers can be further improved by increasing
the isotacticity of homopolypropylene or a polypropylene
component in a propylene block copolymer, in other words,
these properties can be improved by the use of a catalyst
capable of providing a high isotacticity for the propylene
polymers in the preparation thereof.However, a polymer of an olefin such as propylene
obtained by the use of such a catalyst capable of providing
a high isotacticity tends to have a molecular weight higher
than that those obtained by using conventional catalysts.
Accordingly, it has generally been necessary to add
hydrogen as a chain transfer agent in a large amount to the
polymerization system in order to regulate a molecular
weight and a melt flow rate (MFR) of the resulting polymer.
Such large amount of hydrogen presenting in the 
polymerization system, especially when the propylene is per
se used as a polymerization solvent, increases the pressure
of
