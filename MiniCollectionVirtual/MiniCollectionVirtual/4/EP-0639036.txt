<ABSTRACT>
A cordless telephone system in which a plurality of 
base-stations (1, 2, 3) provide coverage for handsets 

(5, 6) over overlapping areas, and transfer means (8, 9, 
10, 11) are provided for performing handover from one 

base-station to another when it is detected that better 
communication between a handset in use can be established 

with a base-station alternative to that with which the 
handset is currently in communication.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cordless telephone 
systems and in particular to such a system comprising more 
than one base-station and providing for handover of a 
handset from one base-station to another. Cordless telephones afford users the capability to make 
and receive calls within a radius of several tens or 
hundreds of metres of a radio base-station. Examples of known cordless telephones comprise a primary 
station (Base Station or Cordless Fixed Part) connected 
via a radio link to a secondary station (Handset or 
Cordless Portable Part). Two existing public standards for cordless telephone systems 
are CT2 and DECT. DECT has 10 radio channels. Each radio channel is time 
division multiplexed into 12 user channels. There is a 
total of 120 channels. When the base-station is not 
transmitting other information, it transmits a reference 
signal. When a handset and base are in communication 
they exchange regular and frequent synchronisation and 
identity information. CT2 has 40 radio channels. There is one user channel per 
radio channel. The base-station does not transmit any 
reference signals so the handset cannot tell in advance 
which base-station will offer the best quality. When 
the handset and base-station are in communication they do  
 
not exchange synchronisation information, except under 
fault conditions, and exchange identity information 
slowly. Three common configurations of cordless telephone systems 
are: residential systems, office systems and public access 
systems. Known residential systems typically comprise at least one 
handset and at least one base-station. The or each base-station 
is connected directly to the telephone network 
(PSTN). The or each base-station may have more than one 
handset registered to it, i.e. it may contain identity 
information for more than one handset. The or each handset 
may be registered to more than one base-station, i.e. it 
may contain identity information for more than one base-station. 
Each base-station is connected to one telephone 
line and incorporates one radio transceiver. Known office systems comprise multiple radio base-stations 
connected to a central switching station. This provides a 
service for multiple users. Users may make or receive 
calls anywhere within the aggregate coverage area of the 
base-stations. When a user travels from the coverage area 
of one base-station to that of another, the system will 
handover the call from the original base-station to a 
destination base-station. This handover is determined 
by

<CLAIMS>
A cordless telephone system having transfer means 
for performing handover of a handset from one to another 

of a plurality of base-stations connected to a common 
interconnection means, the transfer means comprising at 

each base-station means for acquiring knowledge of the 
signal quality of a handset with which it is in 

communication, means for signalling information via the 
common interconnection means if the acquired signal 

quality knowledge indicates that improved handset 
communication may be attainable, means for signalling a 

response via the common interconnection means, and means 
enabling handover to be effected if the signalling 

indicates that another base-station will have more 
favourable communication with the handset. 
A system according to claim 1, comprising a plurality 
of autonomous base-stations connected to a common line 

or set of lines each of which can support multiple 
circuits. 
A system according to claim 2, wherein all the base-stations 
have equal status and the base-stations are 

typically located far apart from one another so that 
their respective coverage areas just overlap. 
A system according to claim 1 or claim 2 or claim 3, 
wherein, in a CT2 system, the means for acquiring 

knowledge comprises means at the base-station for 
measuring the signal quality of the handset with which 

it is in communication, and means enabling a handover to 
be effected if the response signal indicates more 

 
favourable communication between another base-station and 

the handset. 
A system according to claim 1 or claim 2 or claim 3, 
wherein, in a DECT system, the handset constantly monitors 

the qualities of communication with alternative base-stations 
and, if appropriate, requests a handover from a 

base-station offering more favourable communication, this 
alternative base-station then informing the existing base-station 

that it will take over the call, thereby to 
enable the existing base-station to release the call. 
A system according to claim 4 or claim 5, wherein 
each base-station includes 


means for the measurement of the strength of radio 
signal received from a handset, or means for processing 

a measurement received from the handset, 
means for deciding whether or not the measured signal 
quality (at the base-station or the handset) is adequate, 
means for the transmission and reception of signalling 
messages, 
means for the comparison of two values, and 
means for deciding whether or not it should accept 
handover. 
A system according to any of claims 3 to 6, wherein 
the request message comprises two parts, a handset 

identifier and a signal quality indicator value. 
A system according to claim 2 or any claim appendant 
thereto, wherein a or each line or circuit may be arranged 

to carry signalling traffic only or voice traffic only. 
A system according to claim 2 or any claim appendant 
thereto, wherein, for each base-station, certain lines 

are connected to the PSTN and other lines are solely for 
the interconnection of base-stations. 
A system according to any of claims 1 to 9, having 
means enabling a call to be transferred to an alternative 

base-station before the telephone connection to the original 
base-station is released. 
A system according to any of claims 1 to 10, wherein 
the subscription registration data is automatically 

exchanged between the base-stations using the signalling 
means. 
A system according to any of claims 1 to 11, wherein 
the base-station may be programmed so that only a specified 

handset rings in response to a ringing signal on a specified 
line.
