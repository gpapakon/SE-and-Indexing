<ABSTRACT>
A bowling lane is provided with a pair of bumpers (11) to which are attached sensors (31) or switches (50) that are activated when a bowling ball (15) strikes a bumper (11). The bumpers (11) are attached to brackets (26) that are mounted to the floor. Indicators (70) (72) are mounted on the bumper-bracket assembly for signaling when a given bumper (11) has been hit; the score awarded in a given frame may be made to vary in dependance upon whether a given bumper (11) has been struck.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a bowling alley, and more particularly, 
to a system of bumpers that allows for a greater number of variants of the standard 
game of bowling to be played. Bowling is an ancient game. Archaeologists have traced its development through 
various forms by reference to artifacts dating back many thousands of years. In recent 
times, the game's evolution has achieved a standardized form, in which a ball weighing 
generally between 10 and 16 pounds is rolled down an alley or lane of standardized size 
towards a set of ten pins arrayed in a fixed configuration. Straddling each side of the 
bowling lane is a channel-like gutter. In conventional "regulation" bowling, points are 
scored by knocking down pins; when a ball rolls into the gutter, it becomes a so-called 
"gutter ball," and no points are earned. Because of the physical strength necessary to play standard bowling, those with 
physical impairments or who are otherwise lacking in coordination or strength (e.g., due 
to handicap or age) may experience the frustration of playing an entire game of ten 
frames without having knocked down a single pin. This can be especially frustrating 
to children, who may not have the strength and coordination necessary to play the 
game. In response to this problem, numerous systems of "bumper" bowling have been 
developed. These generally involve placing some sort of bumper or other occluding 
member in the gutters so that each ball bowled inevitably results in at least some pins 
being knocked down. In some systems, bumpers are permanently affixed to the gutters, thereby 
preventing anyone from playing a game of regulation bowling on the lane. Other 
systems allow for the removal of "temporary" bumpers from the gutters, through what 
is generally a laborious process. Another example of a bumper system is provided by 
U.S. Patent No. 3,401,933 to Conklin et al. (the contents of which are hereby 
incorporated by reference). In this device, a pivoting concave cylindrical section is 
provided along a length of gutter. When in the retracted position, the cylindrical 
section acts as a standard gutter, enabling the lane to accommodate standard bowling. 
The patent teaches a complex set of linkages and actuators for raising the curved 
cylindrical section to a height and orientation at which its raised edge will prevent a  
 
ball from leaving the lane prior to striking any pins. This edge is provided with a 
switch for detecting when a ball has made contact with the raised section.

<CLAIMS>
An improved bumper bowling system for a bowling lane, the system having a 
plurality of brackets (26) and a plurality of resilient bumpers (11) attached to each of said 

brackets (26) on each side of the bowling lane, wherein the brackets (26) are configured 
to have a feed, stationary orientation with respect to a bowling lane (14), the 

improvement comprising the combination:
 
   serial arranged, segmented bumpers (11), each with its own sensor means (18) for 

detecting and signal means for signaling contact with a bowling ball. 
The device of claim 1, wherein the sensor means (18) is a motion detector. 
The device of claim 1, wherein the sensor means (18) comprises a fluid-filled tube 
and a switch. 
The device of claim 3, wherein the fluid-filled tube is in abutting relationship with 
the bumper (11). 
The device of claim 3, wherein the fluid-filled tube is joined to the bumper (11) 
with an adhesive. 
The device of claim 5, wherein the area of the bumper to which the fluid-filled 
tube is attached is enclosed by a covering.  

 
The device of claim 1, wherein the bracket (26) is generally box-like in appearance, 
and has at least three right angles in cross-section. 
The device of claim 1, wherein each bumper segment and brackets define an 
assembly, and the signal means comprises at least one light. 
The device of claim 1, wherein the signal means provides an audible indication 
when activated. 
The device of claim 9, wherein the light of said signal means is activated when said 
sensor means is struck by a bowling ball. 
The device of claim 8, wherein the signal provided by the signal means varies from 
bumper to bumper. 
The device of claim 1, further comprising a microprocessor that is connected to the 
sensor means and to the signal means. 
The device of claim 1, wherein the combined width of each of said bracket, and 
its associated bumper (11) is less than or equal to 12 inches (30.48 cm.).  

 
A method for bowling, comprising the steps of:
 
   affixing to each side of a bowling lane a bumper comprised of a plurality of 

serially arranged bumper segments and means for determining whether a 
bowling ball has made contact with a bumper segment;
 
   determining whether a ball has struck a bumper segment; and
 
   determining points scored based on the occurrence of contact of the bowling ball 

with the bumper segment, and the number of points scored is dependant 
upon striking a particular bumper segment. 
The method of claim 14, wherein a first indicator is associated `with each bumper, 
and wherein the indicator provides an indication that the bowling ball has made contact 

with the bumper. 
The method of claim 15, wherein a second indicator is provided, said second 
indicator being used to signal to the bowler which bumper he should attempt to strike. 
The method of claim 14, wherein no points are scored when the contact signal from 
any bumper indicates that contact with a ball has been made. 
The method of claim 14, wherein no points are awarded for knocking down a pin 
where the ball has failed to make contact with any bumper. 
The method of claim 14, in which first and second indicators are provided in 
association with each bumper, and in which one of the indicators is triggered in response 

to contact between the ball and the bumper.  
 
The method of claim 14, further including the steps of triggering an indicator 
associated with a given bumper segments so as to provide an indication that said bumper 

has been selected by the system, and awarding points for pins knocked down by the ball 
in dependance upon contact between the selected bumper segment and the ball. 
The method of claim 20, in which the bumper segment is selected at random. 
The method of claim 20, in which the bumper segment is selected by a 
microprocessor.
