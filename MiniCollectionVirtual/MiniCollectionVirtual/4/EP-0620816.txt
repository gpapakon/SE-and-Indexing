<DESCRIPTION>
kNovel thiosemicarbazonethionesThe present invention relates to novel thiosemicarbazonethiones of formula Iι'I C = N — N -C - NHR5 (i)R3wherein R1 is lower alkyl, lower alk-2-en-l-yl or also lower alk-2-yn-l-yl,R2 and R3 are each independently of the other hydrogen or lower alkyl or, taken together, are lower alkylidene,R4 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, aryl or aryl-lower alkyl,R5 is lower alkyl, aryl, aryl-lower alkyl, unsaturated or saturated heterocyclyl-lower alkyl, or is also lower alkyloxycarbonyl-lower alkyl, and the salts thereof, to a process for the preparation of these compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to the use thereof as medicaments.In this specification, radicals and compounds qualified by the term "lower" will be taken to mean those containing preferably up to and including 7, preferably up to and including 4, carbon atoms.Lower alk-2-en-l-yl is typically C3-C5alk-2-en-l-yl, preferably allyl or methallyl.Lower alk-2-yn-l-yl is typically C3-C5alk-2-yn-l-yl, preferably prop-2-yn-l-yl or also but-2-yn-l-yl.Lower alkyl is C1-C4alkyl, typically methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl.Lower alkylidene is typically C1-C4alkylidene, preferably methylene or also ethylidene. 

 Lower alkoxy is is typically n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy or tert-butoxy, preferably ethoxy and, most preferably, methoxy.Aryl by itself and as moiety of composite radicals such as aryl-lower alkyl is typically phenyl or naphthyl, for example 1- or 2-naphthyl, or substituted phenyl or naphthyl, typically phenyl or naphthyl which are substituted by lower alkyl, halo-lower alkyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkanoyloxy, halogen and/or nitro. Aryl is preferably unsubstituted phenyl or phenyl which is substituted as indicated above, and is most preferably phenyl.Aryl-lower alkyl is preferably phenyl-lower alkyl and, most preferably, benzyl.Unsaturated heterocyclyl-lower alkyl is typically heteroaryl-lower alkyl.Heteroaryl in composite radicals such as heteroaryl-lower alkyl is preferably a monocyclic and also bicyclic or polycyclic heterocyclic radical having aromaticity. Bicyclic and polycyclic heteroaryl may be comprised of a plurality of heterocycUc rings or, preferably, consist of one heterocycle and one or more than one, conveniently one or two and preferably one, fused carbocyclic ring, preferably a benzene ring. Each individual ring typically contains 3, 5, 6 or 7 and, preferably, 5 or 6 ring members. Heteroaryl is preferably an azacyclic, thiacyclic, oxacyclic, thiazacyclic,
