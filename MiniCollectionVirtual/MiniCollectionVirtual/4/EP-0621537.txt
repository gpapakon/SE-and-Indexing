<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, one or more addresses are forced to a logic 
state to define a smaller, fully functional portion of embedded memory. A first preferred 

embodiment has a first fuse circuit and a second fuse circuit which control the conduction 
and the output signal of a transmission gate which passes through an address signal. 

The output signal of both the first and the second fuse circuits are input signals to logic 
circuitry which produces a first input signal and a second input signal to the transmission 

gate. When the first fuse is blown, the address signal is forced to a first logic state and 
when the second fuse is blown, the address signal is forced to a second logic state. 

When neither the first fuse nor the second fuse is blown, the address signal is simply 
passed through the transmission gate. 
A second preferred embodiment of the present invention has a first fuse circuit, a 
second fuse circuit, and an inverting stage through which an address signal passes. 

When the first fuse is blown, the address signal is forced to a first logic state and when 
the second fuse is blown, the address signal is forced to a second logic state. When 

neither the first fuse nor the second fuse is blown, the address signal is inverted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit memory devices, and
more specifically to a structure for utilizing a portion of an embedded memory.During the manufacture of integrated circuit memory devices, die are often
discarded because a portion of the die is defective and can not be repaired at, for
instance, laser repair. Even though a major portion of the die may be fully functional, it
is often necessary to discard the entire die as scrap because the functional portion of the
die is not recoverable. For instance, it is not uncommon to scrap a 64K SRAM die which
is partially functional and could yield a 16K SRAM. Even though the 64K SRAM could
be used as a smaller 16K SRAM device, it must be scrapped if there is no plausible
method to recover the functional portion.This concern for recovering a portion of an integrated circuit die extends fully to
embedded memories which find a wide variety of uses in devices such as application
specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and microprocessors. In microprocessor devices, a 
significant amount of embedded memory is often required; for
instance, the Intel 1860 RISC processor and the MIP R4000
processor both have 32K bytes of on-chip and cache memory.
Additionally, Texas Instrument's Super SPARC processor has 36K
bytes of internal memory. In the future, it is likely that both
processors and ASICs will continue to house larger and larger
amounts of memory.As the need for larger embedded memories grows, the yield
constraints driven by manufacturing concerns will grow as well.
Redundancy testing has typically been used to test for
functionality, but this method may not be sufficient or practical
for larger embedded memories. As a result, microprocessors or
ASICs which may be fully functional, other than having a
partially functional embedded memory, may be scrapped. Because
of the high price and profit margin associated with these
devices, it becomes important to recover embedded memory if
possible so that scrapping is kept to a minimum.It would be advantageous in the art to be able to define a
portion of an embedded memory. For example, a smaller,
functional portion of an otherwise only partially functional
embedded memory device could be used as a fully functional,
smaller density embedded memory.Reference is made to European Patent Application 0 098 755
which discloses a circuit for connecting external address signals
to internal memory addresses.Therefore, according to one aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a method for
