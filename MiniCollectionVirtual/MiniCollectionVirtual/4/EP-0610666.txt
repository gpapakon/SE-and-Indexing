<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a turbomolecular pump (turbo-pump) 
(1000) having a cold trap panel (414) wherein the trap 

panel contains an annular panel (416), a disk-shaped panel 
(420) and a supporting frame (418) that connects the annular 

panel (416) to the disk-shaped panel (420) such that these 
two panels are coaxially positioned relative to one another. 

The trap panel (414) is positioned within an inlet (410) to 
the turbo-pump (1000) and coaxially aligned with a main axis 

of an impeller shaft (404) thereof. Additionally, a heater 
(1002) is located proximate said trap panel (414) such that, 

when energized, the heater (1002) relatively quickly 
vaporizes any molecules adsorbed by the trap panel (414).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to vacuum apparatus and,
more particularly, to turbomolecular pumps used for
producing a vacuum in vacuum chambers.Vacuum processes are used widely in semiconductor,
optics, and other fields of industry. For example, in the
electronics industry, a vacuum process is used in the
physical vapor deposition (PVD) method of fabricating thin
film conductors. Such thin films are principally fabricated
through physical deposition of metals upon various substrate
materials. One such PVD technique used in fabricating
metallic thin films is a sputtering method. In general, the
sputtering method involves accelerating, by means of
electrical discharges, argon (Ar+) and other ionic elements
in a vacuum. The accelerated ions collide with a negative
potential electrode (target). The material comprising the
electrode escapes from the surface thereof by receiving the
energy of the argon (Ar+) ions (in a phenomenon called
"sputtering"), and the substance escaping the electrode
deposits itself on a substrate. The result is the formation
of a metallic thin film on the substrate.Such sputtering equipment is typically enclosed in
a vacuum chamber. As such, the transformation of the
thin-film substance from the electrode into highly energetic
ions occurs in a vacuum. Consequently, an evacuation or 
vacuum apparatus is necessary in order to substantially
eliminate any gas from the vacuum chamber within which the
sputtering process is accomplished. Conventionally, either
a cryogenic pump (cryo-pump) or a turbomolecular pump
(turbo-pump) containing a cold trap panel is used for this
purpose.With reference to FIG. 10, the following is a
description of a cryo-pump system 100 that uses a helium gas
refrigerator to cool the pump. In this illustrative
cryo-pump system, the cryo-pump 112 is attached by a
duct 108 to a vacuum chamber 106 through a main valve
(high-vacuum valve) 110. The cryo-pump 112 is connected to
a rotary pump (a mechanical pump) 118 through a cryogenic
rough valve 114. The rotary pump is used to initially
create a partial vacuum (also known as a low or rough
vacuum) in the chamber and the cryo-pump is used after the
partial vacuum is created to further evacuate the chamber.
A rough evacuation duct 120 connects the vacuum chamber 106
to a duct 116 that links the cryogenic valve 114 to the
rotary pump 118. A chamber rough valve 122, located in
duct 120, controls flow therethrough. Another duct 104
protrudes from the vacuum chamber 106, and a chamber vent
valve 102 is provided at a point along this
