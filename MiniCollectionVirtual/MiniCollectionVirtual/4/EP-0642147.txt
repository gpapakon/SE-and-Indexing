<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a photoemission
(photoelectron-emitting) device.The photoemission devices have a photo-electron
converting function to convert incident photons into
photoelectrons and to emit the photoelectrons to the
outside, and, for example, are applied to light-receiving
surfaces of photomultiplier tubes or image
intensifiers.Materials such as alkali antimonides are generally
used for the conventional photoemission devices. For
example, monoalkali photoemitters such as Sb·Cs,
bialkali photoemitters such as Sb·K/Cs, and multialkali
photoemitters such as (Na·K·Sb)Cs are widely put to
practical use. The photoemitters of such types,
however, had a lower photoemission ratio (quantum
efficiency for 
long-wavelength incident photons than that for short-wavelength
incident photons, which raised a problem that
high-sensitive performance could not be achieved over a
wide band and a problem that even for short-wavelength
incident photons the quantum efficiency was not high
enough.In order to improve the quantum efficiency for long-wavelength
incident photons, negative electron affinity
photoemitters using a GaAs semiconductor were developed.
In the negative electron affinity photoemitters, the
energy of the vacuum level is lower than the conduction
band. Then, once photoelectrons at the bottom of the
conduction band can move up to the emission surface, they
can escape into the vacuum. This can improve the quantum
efficiency for long-wavelength incident photons. Use of
a single-crystal semiconductor of GaAs can extend the
diffusion length of photoelectrons as compared with the
photoemitters using the polycrystal materials of alkali
antimonides. Even if the single-crystal semiconductor
has a thickness enough to absorb all incident photons,
the diffusion length can be long enough for
photoelectrons to reach the emission surface.Actual quantum efficiencies of the negative electron
affinity photoemitters, however, are still about 20 % for
the wide band ranging from short wavelengths to long
wavelengths, though an improvement is recognized for 
long-wavelength incident photons.As discussed, the quantum efficiencies of the
photoemitters under practical use are about 30 % for
short-wavelength (for example, ultraviolet) light, but
normally about 10 %, which is extremely low as compared
with known solid state photodetectors such as photodiodes
utilizing the photoconduction or the photoelectromotive
force. This is a significant drawback of the light
detection technology utilizing the photoemission,
because
