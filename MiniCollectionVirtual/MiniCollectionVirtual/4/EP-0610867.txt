<ABSTRACT>
It is known to repair the damaged region of a covering applied to a roll element by hot vulcanisation by a patch being adhesively attached or applied by cold vulcanisation. Owing to the different behaviour, caused by the type of adhesive attachment of the patch, there are losses in the quality of the surface of the covering, which have an adverse effect in the production process. The object of the invention is to provide a device by which the covering can be repaired without impairing the surface quality of the roll. Provided for this purpose is a processing station, by which first of all the damaged location (7) is removed by machining, the then exposed region is cleaned, and the patch (15) is placed into the exposed region, is bonded to the neighbouring covering and to the roll element by hot vulcanisation and, finally, can be otherwise adapted in its dimensions and surface structure by means of machining of the covering. The device makes it possible for the roll or covering repaired in this way to have a satisfactory surface quality no different to that of a new covering.

Device for restoration of a damaged coating of a roller, fitted to a 
roller body by hot-vulcanisation, wherein a patch substantially filling 

the damaged area can be joined to the roller body, wherein a 
processing station (4) is provided, having means for mechanical 

removal of the damaged area (7), for cleaning the damaged area 
then laid bare, for joining the patch (15) then placed in the cleared 

area to the adjacent coating (20) and to the roller body (21) by 
means of hot-vulcanisation or hot pressing, and for mechanical 

processing of the coating (20) for the purpose of matching the 
measurements and surface finish of the coating (20). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that a treatment 
installation for processing continuous webs (25), preferably every 

roller on the treatment installation (23), has at least one processing 
station (4) allocated to it. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that a corona 
electrode is provided which is connected to a generator (28) 

producing a high voltage, and with which the cleared and/or 
restored area, including the adjacent area of the remaining coating 

(20) can be treated. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the processing 
station (4) is installed in a treatment installation (23) for treatment 

by corona of a continuous web (25). 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that the processing  
 

station (4) is mounted in a displaceable manner on stationary 
guides (24). 
Device according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the corona 
electrode can be connected to the generator (28) of the treatment 

installation (23). 
Device according to claim 1, in which the processing station (4) is 
provided with a heated collar which can be placed around the roller 

in the area of the patch (15), characterised in that inserts (35) are 
provided in the heated collar (16). 
Device according to claim 7, wherein the heated collar (16) can be 
tensioned by means of a spring clip (17), characterised in that the 

spring clip (17) can be adjusted by a hydraulically or pneumatically 
actuated adjusting member (34). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the function of the processing station (4) can 

be controlled by a computer. 
Device according to claim 1, wherein the processing station is set 
up on supporting rails which are supported on the rollers by means 

of supporting rollers, characterised in that the supporting rollers are 
configured as supporting balls (33), which are preferably mounted 

in a holder (32). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the processing 
station (4) is provided with a vacuum bell, with which a pasty
 patch 
(15) applied to the damaged area (7) can be evacuated before 

curing.
