<ABSTRACT>
The individual coils (7) with the canted section wires (10) are arranged on the wire stranding head (1). So-called twisting or transposing of the individual section wires (10) is carried out in the twisting head (3). The twisted conductor (11) thus produced in the twisting head (3) is wrapped with various plies of insulating paper in the subsequent insulation braider (4). A caterpillar pull-off (5) capable of swivelling in order to adapt to the bunched dimension of the twisted conductor pulls the twisted conductor (11) from the twisted conductor machine. A winding device (6) mounted downstream of the caterpillar pull-off (5) has a transverse expansion mandrel (12) movable inside a frame (13) in the vertical as well as in the horizontal directions. In addition, this expansion mandrel (12) can also swivel in the horizontal plane. A carrying cylinder (14) that afterwards can be directly laid on the transformer core is arranged on this expansion mandrel (12). This device allows for the first time the winding material producer to produce a complete transformer winding. According to the calculations and design data, the winding can be finished directly after production of the conductor.

Method of manufacturing a winding for transformers with 
profiled wires (10) of angular cross section, whereby the 

profiled wires (10) are combined and spun into a stranded 
conductor (11) in a stranding head (3) thus, that the individual 

profiled wires (10) extend on the two flat sides of the cross 
section, in inclined fashion in opposed sense, and on the slim 

sides of the cross section they cross over from one side to the 
other by means of a bent portion, and whereby the individual 

profiled wires (10) which are arranged one on top of the other 
are arranged, in cross section, possibly spaced from one 

another, in side-by-side relationship and whereby the stranded 
conductor (11) is covered, at least partially, with insulating 

material, characterized in that said stranded conductor (11) is 
wound, corresponding to the transformer winding on a supporting 

cylinder (14) which is arranged on the core of the transformer,

cylinder (14) being continuously collected and fed into a 

computer and in that the stranding pace of the stranded 
conductor (11) is controlled, in accordance with its actual 

winding diameter, by means of the stranding head (3).
