<ABSTRACT>
A digital phase locked loop arrangement is used in 
a desynchronizer demapping a plesiochronous stream from a 

synchronous bitstream is disclosed to remove jitter due to 
overhead gapping from the plesiochronous stream. To this end 

the part of the synchronous bitstream constituting the 
plesiochronous stream is written into a buffer memory (BUFF), 

the write address (WRADDR) of which is incremented at the 
rate of this plesiochronous part. The read address (RDADDR) 

for the buffer memory (BUFF) is derived from the write 
address (WRADDR) in the digital phase locked loop 

arrangement. Herein, a negative feedback for byte 
justifications in the synchronous bitstream and a positive 

feedback for bit justifications therein is provided so that 
byte justifications give rise to a lower change in the 

incrementing rate of the read address (RDADDR) but of longer 
duration, whereas bit justifications give rise to an 

increased change in this incrementing rate but of shorter 
duration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital phase locked loop arrangement
induding:
a low pass filter;an oscillator, whose output is an output of said arrangement;a subtracter to a positive input of which a binary signal is applied and an output of which
is coupled to a negative input thereof via the series coupling of said filter and said
oscillator;a gapped dock generating a gapped dock stream constituted by consecutive pattems,
each pattem comprising successions of pulses and gaps;a control signal generator means providing at least a control signal;a control means which in response to said control signal controls said gapped dock by
adapting said pattems of said gapped dock stream;a counter means which under the control of said controlled gapped clock stream provides
said binary signal.Such a digital phase locked loop arrangement is already known in the art, e.g.
from the article 'Design and performance verification of a SONET-to-DS3 desynchronder'
by R. W. Hamlin, published in Globecom '91, 22.7.1 - 22.7.4, pp. 761 - 764. Fig. 1 of this
article shows signals STS-1 and DS3 which are both digital signals having distinct frame
structures each comprising an overhead part with control bits and a payload part with
information bits. The signal DS3 is mapped in the payload part of the signal STS-1. The
above phase locked loop arrangement is used in connection with a FIFO (First In First Out)
buffer to remove jitter from the payload part of the DS3 signal as extracted from the STS-1
signal. This jitter is due to so-called overhead gapping, i.e. overhead - in the STS-1 and
DS3 frame structures - which is not extracted from the STS-1 signal to obtain the payload 
part of the DS3 signal. The bits of the DS3 signal are written into the FIFO buffer at write
addresses which constitute the binary input signal applied to the phase locked loop
arrangement. As already mentioned, the write address is provided by the counter means
controlled by the gapped dock. The latter dock forms part of the block 'pointer averaging
circuit' shown in Fig. 3 of the above article and is derived under the control of the control
means also induded in the latter block, from a gapped DS3 dock which in its tum is
derived in the block 'pointer tracking and DS3 destuff' shown in Fig. 2 of the above article,
from the regular STS-1 dock by replacing pulses thereof With gaps when bits of the
corresponding DS3 signal do not carry information but overhead.The gapped DS3 dock and therefore also the gapped dock derived from it
and used in the phase
