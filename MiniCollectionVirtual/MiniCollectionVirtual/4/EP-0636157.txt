<ABSTRACT>
Described is a reaction-resin moulding material for the production of mouldings, the material being intended in particular for use in twin-chamber cartridges with a static mixer. The material comprises a pre-accelerated resin component in one chamber and a hardener component in the other chamber, the hardener component consisting of an organic peroxide and a reactive stabilization agent which consists mainly of an organic compound containing epoxy and/or isocyanate groups.

<CLAIMS>
Reaction resin mortar for producing synthetic resin 
bodies for use in two-chamber cartridges having a static 

mixer, the reaction resin mortar containing a preaccelerated 
resin component in one chamber and the 

hardener component in the other chamber, characterised in 
that the hardener component consists of an organic 

peroxide and a reactive stabilising agent that contains 
at least 30% by weight of an organic compound containing 

epoxy and/or isocyanate groups. 
Reaction resin mortar according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the hardener component contains an 

organic peroxide in an amount of from 5 to 50% by weight. 
Reaction resin mortar according to claim 1, characterised 
in that there is used as the preaccelerated resin 

component a resin containing an OH, NH, NH
2
 or COOH 
group. 
Reaction resin mortar according to claim 1, characterised 
in that there is used as the resin an unsaturated 

polyester resin and/or vinyl ester resin and/or acrylic 
resin and, optionally, polyamines.
