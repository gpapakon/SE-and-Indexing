<ABSTRACT>
In a reciprocating piston internal combustion engine with mechanically driven supercharger (20), the number and arrangement of cylinders is designed so that free mass moments of inertia still exist. A shaft of the mechanical supercharger is arranged parallel to the crankshaft of the reciprocating piston internal combustion engine. The mechanical supercharger (20) is driven so as to be angularly synchronised with the crankshaft (32) of the reciprocating piston internal combustion engine. The transmission ratio between supercharger and crankshaft (32) is a whole number. On at least one of its shafts the supercharger (20) has a counterweight, which in operation counteracts the free inertial forces on the reciprocating piston internal combustion engine for the purpose of a low-vibration or vibration-free operation of the internal combustion engine.

Reciprocating-piston internal combustion engine 
having a mechanically driven supercharger (20), the 

number of cylinders and cylinder arrangement of which are 
dimensioned such that free inertia forces/moments of 

inertia persist, 

a shaft of the mechanical supercharger (20) being 
disposed parallel to the crankshaft (32) of the 

reciprocating-piston internal combustion engine and 
being driven by the crankshaft, 
and the supercharger (20), on at least one of its 
shafts, having a counterweight which, during operation, 

counteracts the free inertia forces present 
at the reciprocating-piston internal combustion 

engine, 
 
characterized in that 


the supercharger is a spiral supercharger having 
eccentrically crossing displacement bodies, the 

eccentric disc (23) of which spiral supercharger, 
which is disposed on the drive shaft (24), forms 

together with the rotor (1) the counterweight to 
counteract the free inertia forces/moments of inertia 

of the reciprocating-piston internal combustion 
engine, there being no balancing weights disposed on 

the drive shaft (24), 
the transmission ratio between the drive shaft (24) 
and the crankshaft (32) is a whole number, 
the supercharger (20) is driven in angular synchronization, 
the drive shaft (24) and the crankshaft 

(32) having a reverse direction of rotation, 
and the angular position of the balancing weight 
(38) of the crankshaft (32) and of the eccentric 

disc (23) of the drive shaft (24) being coordinated 
such that the respective compensating centrifugal 

forces counteract one another. 
Reciprocating-piston internal combustion engine 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the spiral 

supercharger has a drive shaft (24) and a guide shaft 
(27), which are both incorporated with the crankshaft  

 
(32) of the reciprocating-piston internal combustion 

engine into a synchronization belt drive (16).
