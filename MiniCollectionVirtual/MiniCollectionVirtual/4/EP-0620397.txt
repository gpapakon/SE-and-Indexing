<ABSTRACT>
The supporting device is composed of a baseplate (1) and of a sliding element (2) which can be displaced to a restricted extent with respect to the baseplate (1) and exhibits a load-attachment part (4), a first covering plate (3) being connected fixedly to the baseplate (1) and exhibiting an opening (5) which permits the through-passage of the load-attachment part (4). Located between the baseplate (1) and the first covering plate (3) is a cavity (11), of which the height is matched to the height of the sliding element (2) and to a further covering plate (7). The opening (5) in the covering plate (3) and the opening (10) of the further covering plate (7) are designed to be larger than the outer contour of the load-attachment part (4), with the result that the sliding element (2), in conjunction with the load-attachment part (4), can be displaced to a restricted extent in the region of the internal width of the openings (5, 10).

<CLAIMS>
Supporting fixture having a floor plate (1) and 
joined thereto a cover plate (3) incorporating an 

opening (5) for the unimpeded passage of a load 
application member (4) joined to a sliding member (2) 

whose dimensions parallel to the floor plate (1) are 
greater than the dimensions of the opening (5) and 

which is disposed in a cavity (11) between the floor 
plate (1) and the cover plate (3) and is adapted to 

be displaced parallel to the floor plate (1) by a 
limited amount, characterised in that the height of 

the cavity (11) at least in the area of displacement 
is substantially the same as the thickness of the 

sliding element (2), and that the size of the opening 
(5) is such that the sliding element (2) is adapted 

to be displaced parallel to the floor plate (1) in 
every direction. 
Supporting fixture according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the inside diameter of the 

opening (5) is roughly twice to six times the maximum 
external contour of the load application member (4) 

passing through the opening. 
Supporting fixture according to either of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the cover 

plate is a multi-part construction and includes a 
first cover plate (3) which is permanently joined to 

the floor plate (1) and at least one additional cover 
plate (7) having an additional opening (10) for the 

load application member (4), the said additional 
opening (10) being disposed between the first cover 

plate (3) and the floor plate (1), resting on the 
first cover plate (3) and being adapted to be 

displaced relative to the latter.  
 
Supporting fixture according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the inside diameter of the 

opening (10) in the additional cover plate (7) is 
smaller than the dimensions of the sliding member (2) 

extending parallel to the floor plate (1), and that 
the external contour of the additional cover plate 

(7) exceeds the inside diameter of the opening (5) in 
the first cover plate (3). 
Supporting fixture according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the floor plate (1), 

the sliding member (2), the cover plate (3) and if 
appropriate the additional cover plates (7) are 

circular or annulus-shaped constructions.
