<DESCRIPTION>
 "FOOTWEAR ASSEMBLY"TECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to a footwear assembly.The invention has particular application to a footwear assembly having an adjustable liner for closely conforming to the unique footshape of an individual wearer. The invention is of particular relevance to ski boots and particular reference will be made to such an application. However the invention is applicable to other sporting shoes such as running shoes, basketball boots, roller blades, hiking boots etc, and it will be understood that the invention is applicable to all footwear, including orthotic footwear.BACKGROUND ART Ski boots are known to utilise support/cushioning means for cushioning the user's foot from the rigid inner surface of the boot casing. Orthotic footwear is also well known and patient-specific orthotic inserts are provided for podiatric treatment. It is thus well known to shape support/cushioning means to conform to the footshape of an individual user, however known systems are not simple to operate and can also require specialist orthotic assistance to establish user-specific cushioning means conforming to the unique footshape of an individual. Moreover, once established, known support/cushioning means cannot be reÂ¬ shaped to conform to the unique footshapes of different individuals or to allow for the fact that the footshape of one person varies with age, time, temperature and in accordance with other factors.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention aims to provide a footwear assembly which will be reliable and efficient in use.This invention in one aspect resides broadly in a 

footwear assembly including:- an adjustable outer boot or shoe, and support means for supporting a foot as hereinafter defined within the outer boot or shoe, the support means including at least one flexible chamber containing particulate material.As used herein, the expression "foot" can include the ankle and the lower leg.It is preferred that the assembly includes an exhaust valve for the exhaust of fluid from the chamber.The flexible chamber can be of any suitable shape and manner of construction as is suitable for providing a cushioning layer between a foot and the outer boot or shoe, and can be a bag-like chamber or a bladder. It is preferred that the chamber includes an outer lining adapted to substantially juxtapose the inner surfaces of the outer boot or shoe and an inner lining adapted to substantially juxtapose the surface of a foot when positioned within the outer boot or shoe. The chamber may extend to

 CLAIMS
1. A footwear assembly including:- an adjustable outer boot or shoe, and support means for supporting a foot as hereinbefore defined within said outer boot or shoe, said support means including at least one flexible chamber containing particulate material.
2. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein said assembly includes an exhaust valve for the exhaust of fluid from said chamber.
3. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein said chamber includes an outer lining adapted to substantially juxtapose the inner surfaces of said outer boot or shoe and an inner lining adapted to substantially juxtapose the surface of a foot when positioned within said outer boot or shoe.
4. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 3, wherein said assembly includes a lower flexible chamber adapted to support the sole of said foot within said outer boot or shoe.
5. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 4, wherein said assembly includes at least one upper flexible chamber adapted to support other surfaces of said foot within said outer boot or shoe.
6. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 5, wherein said chambers are in fluid communication whereby fluid from each said chamber is exhaustible through said exhaust valve.
7. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 6, 


wherein at least said upper chambers include a plurality of baffles between said outer and inner linings to form a plurality of discrete compartments therein.
8. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 7, wherein said baffles are inclined to said outer and inner linings.
9. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 8, wherein said compartments are in fluid communication and contain particulate material.
10. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 9, wherein said baffles comprise a membrane looped from one of said outer or inner linings to the other lining and back to constitute an envelope.
11. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 10, wherein said envelopes contain particulate material.
12. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 3, wherein said assembly includes an inner foot enclosure adapted to fit within said outer boot or shoe, the outer surface of said inner foot enclosure constituting said outer lining.
13. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 12, wherein said assembly includes cushioning means adjacent said inner lining and constituting an inner surface of said inner foot enclosure.
14. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 3, wherein said assembly includes pump means for exhausting fluid from chamber.
15. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 14, wherein said fluid is air and said pump means is a vacuum pump. 


16. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 14, wherein said assembly includes reservoir means forming a closed fluid system with said chamber, said exhaust valve is a two-way valve, and said pump means is operable to transfer fluid between said chamber and said reservoir in accordance with the condition of said two-way valve.
17. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 3, wherein said particulate material comprises resilient pellets.
18. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 17, wherein said resilient pellets are polystyrene beads or the like.
19. A footwear assembly as claimed in claim 17, wherein said resilient pellets are encapsulations of a shock- absorbent gaseous fluid, liquid or gel-like substance.
20. A ski boot including:- an adjustable outer casing, and an inner boot assembly within said casing; wherein said inner boot assembly includes an outer surface adapted to substantially juxtapose the inner surface of said casing, an inner surface adapted to substantially juxtapose the surface of a foot as hereinbefore defined when said foot is positioned within said inner boot assembly, and support means located between said outer and inner surfaces, said support means including at least one flexible chamber containing particulate material.
21. A ski boot as claimed in claim 1, wherein said ski boot includes an exhaust valve for the exhaust of fluid from said chamber.
22. A method of supporting a foot as hereinbefore defined in footwear, said method including:- 


 providing a footwear assembly having an adjustable outer boot or shoe and support means within said outer boot or shoe, said support means including at least one flexible chamber containing fluid and particulate material; positioning a foot within said support means; removing substantially all said fluid from said chamber, and tightening said outer boot or shoe about said support means.
