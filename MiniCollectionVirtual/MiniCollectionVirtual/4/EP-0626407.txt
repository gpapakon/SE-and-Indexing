<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for making flame 
retardant polycarbonates by phosgenating a mixture of 

bisphenols having up to about 50 mole % of 
tetrahalobisphenols, such as tetrabromobisphenols. 

There is employed a mixture of a phase transfer 
catalyst and a tertiary organic amine to provide high 

molecular weight copolymer without excessive phosgene 
usage.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to copending applications RD-22,833 
(USSN 08/066,380) and RD-22,333 (USSN 08/066,382) filed 
concurrently herewith. The present invention relates to a method 
for making flame retardant polycarbonate copolymers 
having condensed polyhalo aromatic carbonate units. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to 
the phosgenation of bisphenol mixtures having up to 
about 50 mole % of polyhalo substituted bisphenol in 
the presence of an effective amount of a mixture of a 
tertiary organic amine and a phase transfer catalyst. As shown by U.S. patent 3,912,687, 
tetrahalobisphenols can be polymerized under 
interfacial reaction conditions using relatively large 
amounts of trialkylamine catalyst in a two-stage 
reactor. However, a relatively low molecular weight 
polycarbonate is often formed. Polyhalobisphenol 
polycarbonates having a higher molecular weight can be 
made by the procedure shown by Ho et al, U.S. patent 
4,794,156. Phosgene is added to an alkali metal 
polyhalobisphenate salt to produce the corresponding 
chloroformate. An activated pyridine, such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 
or 2-substituted pyridine is 
then added to increase the molecular weight of the 
resulting polycarbonate.  A method for making block copolycarbonates 
from diphenols and tetrahalogenated diphenols by 
phosgenation under interfacial reaction conditions is 
shown by Marks, U.S. patent 4,902,758. A mixture of 
bisphenol and a tetrahalogenated bisphenol are 
phosgenated under interfacial reaction conditions at 
different pH's to form bisphenol polycarbonate 
oligomers having chloroformate end groups and 
tetrahalogenated bisphenol chloroformate monomers. 
During a subsequent step, the chloroformate oligomers 
and monomers are coupled utilizing an activated 
pyridine catalyst. Another procedure for making 
copolymers of bisphenol A and a halogenated bisphenol 
utilizing a pentahalogenophenol as a molecular weight 
modifier, is shown by Komatsu et al, U.S. patent 
4,918,155. Although various procedures have been 
employed to phosgenate polyhalobisphenols and mixtures 
of polyhalobisphenols and bisphenols substantially 
free of aromatic ring substituted halogen groups, the 
molecular weight of the resulting polycarbonates are 
often lower than expected, and the phosgene 
requirements are often excessively high. More 
efficient condensation catalysts are therefore 
constantly being evaluated to minimize phosgene usage 
while improving molecular weights of polycarbonate 
having polyhalo carbonate units.

A method for making flame retardant 
polycarbonates which comprises, 


(1) phosgenating a tetrahalobisphenol 
mixture comprising up to about 50 mole % of a 

bisphenol of the formula, 
 

where X - XÂ³ are halogen atoms, and Y is a member 
selected from the group consisting of -O-, -S-

range of about 9 to about 11 and in the presence of an 

effective amount of a condensation catalyst comprising 
a mixture of a tertiary organic amine and a phase 

transfer catalyst, until up to about 90 mole % of the 
phosgene required to react with the available phenolic 

hydroxy groups in the mixture has been introduced, 
(2) altering the pH of the mixture to a 
range of about 10.5 to 12 to effect the substantial 

elimination of chloroformate groups in the resulting 
reaction mixture of (1), and
