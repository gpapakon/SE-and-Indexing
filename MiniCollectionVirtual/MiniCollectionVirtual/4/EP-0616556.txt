<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a method of treating whole-grain cereals, wherein the grains are spray washed. The process uses only slightly more water than is needed to cover the surface of the grains. A countercurrent of air is directed at the grains and excess water is eliminated. Grains treated in this way are subjected to impact turbulence.

<CLAIMS>
Method of removing the outer fruit shell of whole-grain 
cereals, wherein water is added to the grains in form of 

a spray wash (11, 17), an air stream is guided past the 
grains to remove the detached fruit shells, and excess 

water is drained in a subsequent step during which the 
pretreated grains are subjected to diametral impact 

turbulence (35, 36, 38, 34, 33, 28) by guiding them into 
a chamber with fixed and rotating operation coatings, 

characterized in that only slightly more water is 
provided than is needed to cover the surface of the 

grains for the purpose of localization of a 
predetermined moisture quantity to the morphologically 

determined separation zone between the longitudinal and 
the transverse cell layer, the projections and/or 

grooves of the operation coatings accelerating the 
hitting grains with diametral turbulence and grinding 

them diametrally against each other on their whole 
surface.
