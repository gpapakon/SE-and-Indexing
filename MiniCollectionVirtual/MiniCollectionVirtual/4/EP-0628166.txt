<ABSTRACT>
A hematology control product comprising leukocyte analogs and an aqueous solution of a plasma substance for use in a blood counting instrument is described. The instrument employs a lytic reagent system for the lysable red blood cells in the control product. The plasma substance is in an amount effective to enable the differentiation of each of said leukocyte analogs relative to the physical attributes of the analogs, said physical attributes of the analog are similar to human leukocytes. Preferably, the plasma substance comprises cholesterol or its derivatives. A method for using the cell suspension media comprising an aqueous solution of a plasma substance is also described. The method provides a quality control to determine whether an instrument is operating within manufacturer's specifications.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel suspension medium
for hematological compositions, having particular utility
with reference blood cell analogs for devices using
electronic and optical means for whole blood
determinations, and processes for making and using analogs
and the suspension media.Quality control long has been a necessary and routine
procedure in clinical hematology. Accuracy in the
counting of red blood cells and white blood cells,
including differentiating among the subpopulations of
white blood cells is dependent, in part, upon the use of
adequate control products. With the numerous types of
equipment for particle counting now available, quality
control by the use of control products is necessary, since
the possibility of malfunctioning of the instrument is
ever present. The traditional method of maintaining a
quality control program for automatic particle counting
equipment has consisted of providing fresh human blood as
a whole blood standard. However, this fresh blood is
usable for only one day, therefore, durable blood products
were developed.Hematology control products, which contain reference
blood cell analogs, which monitor the accuracy and
precision of blood cell counting devices are especially
important. It is recognized that there is a present need
for new reference blood cell analogs for maintaining the
accuracy of white cell differentiation and other
parameters when employing such blood cell counting
devices. Control products should approximate that of fresh
whole blood as closely as possible. Attempts have been
made to provide suitably sized particles in stable
suspensions by the use of ragweed pollen, polystyrene,
latex, various organic materials and fixed human red
cells. None of these suspensions have proved suitable for
use as a control product for white cell differentiation of
at least four subpopulations of leukocytes.The material used for maintaining quality control,
hereinafter called a hematology control product or control
product, can under specific circumstances be used also to
calibrate hematology instruments. For the purposes of
this invention, the control product will contain one or
more analogs suspended in a liquid media which, when
analyzed, simulates at least one physical or biological
property of blood which the instrument is capable of
analyzing. As used herein, an analog is defined as a
particle which simulates at least one physical or
biological property of a target population. As such,
some automatic machines are able to analyze only certain
components of
