<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for fixing a sanitary unit (1) provided with at least two mounting openings (8), in particular a WC, urinal or bidet, on a wall (3) by means of threaded rods (2). In order to fix a sanitary unit (1), provided with at least two prefabricated mounting openings (8), on a wall, said fixing permitting secure and permanent mounting of the sanitary unit (1) without this resulting in damage to the sanitary unit (1) due to the tightening forces applied upon mounting, the intention being for the fixing elements to comprise only a small number of components of simple shape, it is proposed that it be possible to press the sanitary unit (1) against an abutment surface (9) of the wall (3) or of the floor by means of in each case one nut (7), using two backing members (5) which can each be attached on to a threaded rod (2) in the transverse direction, it being possible to screw the nuts (7) on to the free ends of the threaded rods (2), and tighten them, through in each case an opening (1d) in the sanitary unit (1).

Fixing device for fixing a sanitary unit
(1), especially a water closet, urinal or bidet,

provided with at least two installation apertures (8),
to a wall (3) or the floor, with threaded rods (2)

anchored in the wall (3) or floor and nuts (7) which
can be screwed onto the free ends of the threaded rods

(2) to secure the sanitary unit (1) positioned on the
threaded rods (2), characterized in that a spacer (5)

can be pushed onto each threaded rod (2) in the
transverse direction of the threaded rod (2), via which

spacer the sanitary unit (1) to be fixed can in each
case be pressed against a bearing surface (9) of the

wall (3) or the floor by means of a nut (7), and the
spacers (5) and nuts (7) can, respectively, be pushed

on transversely to the threaded rods (2) and pushed on
to the free ends of the threaded rods (2) and tightened

through, in each case, an aperture (1d) in the sanitary
unit (1).
Fixing device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the nuts (7) are designed as

capstan nuts provided with radially extending blind
threaded holes (10).
Fixing device according to Claim 1 or Claim
2, characterized in that the spacer (5) is designed as

a U-shaped body.
Fixing device according to at least one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the spacer (5) is

of two-layered design and a contact surface (5b) lying 
against the sanitary unit (1) consists of a plastic

material.
Fixing device according to at least one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that a bearing block

(4) is arranged on the threaded rod (2) between the
spacer (5) and the wall (3), on which bearing block the

sanitary unit (1) rests in the vertical direction.
Fixing device according to at least one of
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a further spacer

(6) is arranged between the spacer (5) and the nut (7).
