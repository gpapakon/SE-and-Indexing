<ABSTRACT>
A pin coupling for locking the connection between a male 
connector (2) and a female connector (6) connecting co-axial 

cables (1, 15) comprises: a male cap (10) lodging 
inside one of the two connectors and a female cap (16, 20) 

lodging another connector (6, 2) and a second co-axial 
cable and is characterized in that said male cap (10) and 

said female connector (16, 20) lock in the closed position 
of their connection through the snapping action of locking 

means belonging to each cap and co-operating with two 
annular projecting parts (9b, 9c) being present on the 

outer metal screen belonging to the female or male connector 
(6, 2) lodging inside the cap (16,20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a pin coupling 
according to the preamble of claim 1. When it is necessary to obtain a permanent connection 
between a male connector and a female connector of a coaxial 
cable, it is advisable to ensure the locking between 
said connectors through special kinds of couplings, 
substantially consisting of two caps, a male cap and a 
female cap which are joined together in order to ensure not 
only the connection between them, but also the connection 
between the male and female connectors which are inside 
said caps. According to patent DE 40 15 092 a pin coupling is known, 
which has a male cap and a female cap connecting them 
together through a projecting part on the male cap and a 
corresponding notch on the female cap. The connection 
between the two co-axial cables and consequently between 
the two male and female connectors and the caps takes place 
in two phases. First a connector is joined to the other 
one so that the male cap realizes a first locking between 
the male connector and the female connector. Then the 
female cap is closed through an axial translation movement 
on the male cap by means of the snap tightening of the 
notch on the projecting part previously described. A pin coupling of the now described type presents some 
limits of its functionality, due to the fact that the 
connecting and closing movements of the coupling takes 
place in two phases and, above all, because it is necessary 
to operate first by pushing the male connector and the 
female connector one against the other and then by pushing 
on the side of the female connector. It is evident that 
with the now described coupling the operator has to 
perform two different actions in a sequence.  
 The main purpose of the present invention is that of overcoming 
the inconveniences previously mentioned. The first purpose is to realize a pin coupling such that 
the connection between the male connector and the female 
connector and the locking of the female cap on the male 
cap will occur by pushing the cable from one side only or 
by operating on the cap from one side only. Another purpose of the present invention is to obtain a pin 
coupling with watertight characteristics, in order to 
prevent the water from damaging or altering the connection 
of the co-axial cable. This aspect is particularly interesting, 
especially if the seal is realized in pin couplings 
which are used for connecting cables of car radio antennas. 
In that case, in fact, the pin couplings are exposed 
to bad weather and,
