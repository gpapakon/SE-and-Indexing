<CLAIMS>
A commercially prepared two-component system for
the treatment and prophylaxis of sepsis and of

septic shock, where the components are intended to
act in combination with each other, and where one

component is a thrombin inhibitor and the second a
substance which influences the formation, the

liberation, the plasma and tissue levels, and the
receptor binding of cytokines, or is an inhibitor

of complement or of the kallikrein/kinin system.
The two-component system as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the components are contained in a

pharmaceutical.
The two-component system as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the components are contained in a packaging

unit.
The two-component system as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the thrombin inhibitor is an antithrombin

III obtained from human plasma or prepared recombinantly.
The two-component system as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the thrombin inhibitor is the natural hirudin

isolated from leaches or is a recombinantly
prepared hirudin, or a mutant of hirudin, or a

synthetic thrombin-inhibiting substance. 
The two-component system as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the second component is a recombinantly

prepared, soluble, interleukin I receptor or
receptor antagonist, or its Fc-fusion protein, a

recombinantly prepared, soluble, TNF receptor or
receptor antagonist, or its Fc-fusion protein, or

recombinantly prepared interleukin 10, an inhibitor
of complement, or a C1 esterase inhibitor.
The two-component system as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the second component is an inhibitor of the

kallikrein/kinin system.
The two-component system as claimed in claim 5,
wherein the second component is natural antagosan

isolated from mammalian tissue, or is recombinantly
prepared antagosan.
A process for preparing a two-component system for
the treatment and prophylaxis of sepsis and septic

shock, where the components are intended to act in
combination with each other, and where the one

component is a thrombin inhibitor and the second a

cytokine antagonist, or an inhibitor of bradykinin
or complement, wherein the components are brought

into a suitable administration form for use in
humans.
The use of a thrombin inhibitor and of a cytokine
antagonist, or inhibitor of bradykinin or complement,

in a process for preparing a pharmaceutical
for the treatment and prophylaxis of sepsis and of

septic shock.
