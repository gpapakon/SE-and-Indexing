<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for cleaning tablet, pill or granule packing machines, in particular of rotary tabletting presses, having at least one treatment chamber which encloses the rotor. In order to ensure complete removal of remaining liquid from the treatment chamber and of the components remaining in the latter, in particular of the rotor of a rotary tabletting press, while using a small amount of cleaning and rinsing liquid, a cleaning and a rinsing agent are successively sprayed within the treatment chamber and are sucked off again. Then all the apertures of the treatment chamber are sealed and a low pressure region of about 0.1 to 0.2 bar of absolute pressure is created inside the treatment chamber, which is now encapsulated. The low pressure region sucks the remaining residual moisture from all the bores and connection gaps of the rotor and from the treatment chamber.

<CLAIMS>
Method for cleaning pelleting, sugar-coating and 
granulating machines, in particular rotary 

pelleting presses, having a treatment chamber (4) 
which encloses at least the rotor (3),
characterized in that,
 
inside the treatment chamber (4), a cleaning agent 

and then a rinsing agent are consecutively sprayed 
and sucked off again and in that all the openings 

of the treatment chamber (4) are sealed and an 
underpressure is generated inside the then enclosed 

treatment chamber (4). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the underpressure is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 bar 

of the absolute pressure. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the temperature inside the treatment chamber 

(4) is kept above room temperature, preferably 
between 40 and 70 °C, during the spraying 

operations.  
 
Method according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the rotor (3) is rotated during the spraying 

operations. 
Method according to one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that, after the spraying operation 

and before the establishment of the reduced 
pressure, superheated steam enters the enclosed 

treatment chamber (4) and the enclosed treatment 
chamber (4) is kept at a specified sterilization 

temperature for a predetermined sterilization time. 
Device for carrying out the method according to one 
of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that, inside the 

treatment chamber (4), spray nozzles (11) are 
provided for spraying the cleaning agent and the 

rinsing agent and in that connecting pipe pieces 
(10,14) are provided for sucking off the cleaning 

agent and rinsing agent and for a reduced-pressure 
device for generating a reduced pressure of about 

0.1 to 0.2 bar inside the hermetically enclosed 
treatment chamber (4). 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in that, 
for the purpose of emptying the treatment chamber 

(4) in as residue-free a manner as possible, the 
base surface has a gradient of 3 to 4°. 
Device according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that the high-pressure spray nozzels (11) are 

formed at the ends of the horizontal bars of 
E-shaped spraying heads.
