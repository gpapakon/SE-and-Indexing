<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for washing and drying tableware has two chambers 
(114,116), one for 

washing and rinsing (114), the other (116) for drying and disinfection, 
that are adjacent to 

each other and separated by a door (120) that slides between an open 
position and a 

tight closed position. Each chamber has its own dish-rack feed 
device (143,147).

<DESCRIPTION>
In the field of apparatus for washing and drying dishes the state of the art 
essentially comprises two classes of apparatus: large apparatus for industrial 
use or for large communities (for example, hospitals) and small apparatus for 
use in the home, in bars or in small commercial enterprises. The former generally have no space restrictions and comprise a series of 
chambers, one for each operation, for example a pre-washing chamber, a 
washing chamber, a rinsing chamber, and a drying chamber, the chambers 
being physically at a sufficient distance from each other for the water that 
performs a function in one chamber not to mix with the water that performs 
another function in another chamber. The dishes are conveyed through the 
chambers inside racks that are suitably driven by a single conveyor belt 
system that passes along the different chambers; the chambers always 
communicate with each other, or else flexible curtains are provided between 
one chamber and the other which obviously do not create a tight closure. An 
example of such apparatus is described in EP-A-O 512 691. These apparatus 
wash the dishes in a satisfactory manner, but require large spaces for 
installation; in addition a good separation is not always achieved between 
washing water and rinsing water. The machines of the second type carry out all the operations in succession in 
a single environment in which the dishes are placed in a rack that remains 
fixed during the series of operations. This leads to inferior practical and  
 
hygienic results, in that it is impossible to accommodate a wash/rinse system 
and at the same time a drying/disinfecting system in a single chamber. The aim of the present invention is to provide a machine for washing 
tableware that affords the advantages of both of the previous solutions, i.e. 
that is of limited size and nevertheless allows hygienically optimal washing 
and drying. These aims have been achieved with an apparatus as claimed in claim 1 and a 
procedure as in claim 9. Further characteristics are stated in the subsequent claims. The new apparatus comprises two adjacent intercommunicating chambers 
separated from each other by a door that can be opened and closed in a 
watertight manner and a rack conveyor system that is able to transfer the rack 
from one chamber to the other while the door is raised and out of the second 
chamber, according to a predetermined program that also controls opening 
and closing of the doors. According to a further characteristic the second 
chamber also

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for washing and drying dishes, characterised by the fact 
that it comprises: 

a washing-rinsing chamber (14; 114) and a drying chamber (16; 116); 
a system to convey the dish racks (22) from one chamber to another; 

said two chambers being adjacent, with a communicating opening that can be 
closed in a watertight manner by a door (20); 

said conveying system comprising a feed device (43; 143) for the washing-rinsing 
chamber and a feed device (47; 147) for the drying chamber. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that it also 
comprises at least one germicidal lamp (26; 126) in the drying chamber (16; 

116). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that it 
comprises a further door (30; 130) at the exit from the drying chamber (16; 

116) and said middle door (20; 120) and said further door (30; 130) are 
moved in unison by a single motor (28; 128). 
An apparatus according to claim 3, characterised by the fact that the 
doors slide vertically on tracks and the motor (28) drives belts (33, 34) that 

raise said doors. 
An apparatus according to claim 3, characterised by the fact that each 
of said doors (120, 130) is made of plurality of sections that slide vertically 

reciprocally, and said motor (128) is connected with flexible means (123, 
133) to the most distant sections. 
An apparatus according to claim 2, characterised by the fact that it 
comprises at least one lower germicidal lamp. 
An apparatus according to claim 2, characterised by the fact that said 
germicidal lamp is mounted so that it can translate longitudinally and/or 

transversally with respect to the direction in which the racks are conveyed. 
An apparatus according to claim 3, characterised by the fact that it 
comprises a control device to co-ordinate operations for opening and closing 

of the doors and feeding of the rack conveying devices. 
A procedure for washing/rinsing/drying of tableware in racks in an 
apparatus according to claim 3, comprising the phases of 


a) washing/rinsing of the tableware in the washing/rinsing chamber; 
b) conveying of the rack(s) from the washing chamber to the drying chamber; 
c) drying, possible disinfection of tableware in the drying chamber 
 
characterised by the fact that phases a) and c) take place with the racks at a 

standstill. 
A procedure according to claim 9, characterised by the fact that the 
end of phase a) and phase c) determines the start of phase b) and opening of 

the doors, whilst the end of phase b) determines the start of phases a) and b) 
and closing of the doors. 
A procedure according to claim 9, characterised by the fact that, at an 
interval from the start of drying, the start of disinfection with germicidal 

lamps is determined.
