<ABSTRACT>
An interactive data transfer system and method is provided. In embodiments of the invention, the data transfer system includes a computing device, and a data well for interfacing with an elongate instrument, the elongate instrument having a data transfer end with a data transfer tip. The data well has a housing with an opening for receiving the data transfer tip of the elongate instrument. The data well also has a communications port operatively coupled to the computing device to provide data to the computing device, and the data well has a data communication device contained in the housing for interfacing with the data transfer tip when the data transfer end of the elongate instrument is received in the opening. The computing device is programmed to receive data from the data well. The received data includes data indicative of at least one address on a global communications network. The computer device is also programmed, upon receipt of the at least one address, to launch an application to retrieve information related to the at least one address from the global communications network and transmit such information to the computing device.

 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR STORING REFERENCECODES IN A WRITING INSTRUMENT AND FOR RETRIEVINGINFORMATION IDENTIFIED BY THE REFERENCE CODESRelated ApplicationsThis application claims priority from Provisional Application Serial No. 60/089,891 filed June 19, 1998, and is a continuation in part of Serial No. 08/994,684 filed December 19, 1997, both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present application, the A.T. Cross Company of Lincoln, Rhode Island, and both of which are incorporated herein by reference.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for reading and storing reference codes and subsequently retrieving information identified by the reference codes. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system that uses an instrument having an electronic reading, storage and transmission apparatus incorporated therein to read, store and subsequently transmit reference codes to a computer system. The computer system (which may be connected to a worldwide computer network such as the Internet) retrieves information identified by the reference codes.Background of the InventionReaders of newspapers and other periodicals typically encounter articles or advertisements that describe subject matter for which they are interested in obtaining additional information. Articles in typical periodicals are limited in the amount of information they can convey because of space constraints and because of the desire to transfer information in a concise manner to a large number of readers. Many of the readers have only limited interest in the subject matter of a particular article.While the use of concise articles attracts a large number of readers, those readers who wish to obtain more information on the subject matter of an article are often frustrated by the limited content provided in concise articles. These frustrated readers will often times read several periodicals or utilize online internet news and information services to obtain the information they desire. When using online news and information services, users are typically required to conduct a number of time consuming searches to obtain the information they desire. Thus, a need exists for a simple way of obtaining additional information related to articles of interest. 

 In addition, in today's every increasing use of catalogues by both consumers at home or at work and by sales personnel working for companies, the user must write down, or otherwise note, the catalog number(s) and often the price(s)

CLAIMS
1. An interactive data transfer system comprising: a computing device; a data well for interfacing with an elongate instrument, the elongate instrument having a data transfer end with a data transfer tip, the data well having a housing with an opening for receiving the data transfer tip of the elongate instrument, the data well having a communications port operatively coupled to the computing device to provide data to the computing device, and the data well having a data communication device contained in the housing for interfacing with the data transfer tip when the data transfer end of the elongate instrument is received in the opening; wherein the computing device is programmed, to receive data from the data well, the received data including data indicative of at least one address on a global communications network, the computer device also being programmed, upon receipt of the at least one address, to launch an application to retrieve information related to the at least one address from the global communications network and transmit such information to the computing device.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the global communications network is the Internet.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the computing device includes a display device to display information retrieved over the Internet.
4. The system of claim 3, in combination with the elongate instrument.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the elongate instrument is a writing instrument and further includes a writing tip at a second end of the writing instrument opposite the data transfer end.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the data transfer tip of the writing instrument is constructed and arranged to scan bar codes and store information related to the bar codes in the data transfer end of the writing instrument. 

7. The system of claim 6, wherein the data well is contained within the computing device.
8. The system of claim 4, wherein the data transfer tip of the elongate instrument is constructed and arranged to scan bar codes and store information related to the bar codes in the data transfer end of the elongate instrument.
