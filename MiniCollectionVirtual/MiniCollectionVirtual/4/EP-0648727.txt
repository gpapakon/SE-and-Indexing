<ABSTRACT>
In order to remove unsaturated impurities (in particular 1-chloro-2,2-difluoroethylene and polyfluoropropenes) present in crude 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (F134a), a gaseous mixture of crude F134a, hydrofluoric acid and chlorine is treated in the gas phase, in the presence of a fluorination catalyst, at a temperature of between 100 and 300 DEG C and under a pressure of between atmospheric pressure and 2.5 MPa, the HF/F134a molar ratio being between 0.05 and 0.5 and the Cl2/F134a molar ratio between 0.0001 and 0.1.

Process for the purification of a crude 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane 
(F134a) containing unsaturated impurities, 

characterized in that a gaseous mixture of crude 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, hydrofluoric acid and chlorine 

is treated in the gas phase, at a temperature between 100 
and 300Â°C and at a pressure ranging from atmospheric 

pressure to 2.5 MPa, in the presence of a fluorination 
catalyst, the HF/F134a molar ratio 
being between 0.05 and 
0.5 and the Cl
2
/F134a molar ratio being between 0.0001 
and 0.1. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which the 
unsaturated impurities are l-chloro-2,2-difluoroethylene 

and/or C
3
 or C
4
 (chloro)fluorinated olefins. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
reaction is carried out at a pressure between atmospheric 

pressure and 1.5 MPa. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in 
which the contact time is between 10 and 200 seconds, 

preferably between 20 and 100 seconds. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in 
which the HF/F134a molar ratio is between 0.125 and 

0.300. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in 
which the Cl
2
/F134a molar ratio is between 0.001 and 
0.03. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in 
which the fluorination catalyst is a bulk or supported 

catalyst based on chromium, nickel, iron, manganese, 
cobalt and/or zinc. 
Process according to Claim 7, in which a bulk  
 

chromium oxide is used as catalyst. 
Process according to Claim 7, in which a nickel 
fluoride supported on fluorinated alumina is used as 

catalyst. 
Process according to Claim 7, in which a catalyst 
based on nickel fluoride and on chromium oxide which are 

supported on aluminium fluoride is used.
