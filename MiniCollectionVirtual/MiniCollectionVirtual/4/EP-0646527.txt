<ABSTRACT>
The packaging sheet is applied to cover the 
contents and simultaneously seals them. The sealing 

corresponding position of the packaging sheet A is moved 
toward or away from by the adhering mechanism 3 to the 

adhering tapes C1, C2, C2 fed out from the tape feeding-out 
mechanisms 2, 2, 2, thereby adhering tapes C1, C2, 

C2 are adhered to the sealing corresponding position 
while being partially projected, thereafter the 

packaging sheet A having the adhering tapes C1, C2, C2, 
C3 adhered thereto is fed out by the sheet feeding-out 

mechanism 4 to the packaging start position P1, thereby 
in concurrent with the completion of the folding of the 

packaging sheet A during the packaging operation, 
projected portions of the adhering tapes C1, C2, C2 are 

adhered.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a packaging machine in which substantially 
rectangular-shaped contents such stacks of papers or books, longitudinal 
zig-zag folded and overlapped belt-like clothes or fabrics or accumulated 
boxes are wrapped by a packaging sheet such as a craft paper. More 
particularly, the machine is one in which a packaging sheet is wrapped 
around the outer surface of the contents and the sheet is sealed with at 
least one length of an adhesive tape, while the packaging sheet and the 
contents are placed on a mounting surface of an elevator and are being 
transported in a vertical direction from a packaging starting position 
under an ascending or descending of the elevator. A packaging machine of this kind is disclosed in the gazette of 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 3-14685, and includes a paper feeding 
table, on which packaging sheets are piled, and which is located at the 
side of an ascending or descending passage of the elevator. The table is 
arranged to be inclined upwardly toward the upper end of the ascending 
or descending passage, and only one packaging sheet is separated and fed 
onto the elevator, the contents are placed on the predetermined position 
on this packaging sheet, the elevator is lowered to fold both ends of the 
packaging sheet into a substantial U-shape, then both ends are 
overlapped along the upper surface of the contents to complete the 
wrapping stage. Subsequently, the wound contents are horizontally 
transported from the elevator toward a discharging table, and thereby the 
end portions of the packaging sheet are folded inwardly along the side 
surfaces of the contents. Thereafter, the upper flaps of the sheet ends are  
 
folded down along the side surfaces of the contents, and concurrently a 
length of adhering tape fed out by a tape feeding mechanism from a 
supply is adhered to both overlapped ends of the packaging sheet and sealed. 
Next, the lower flaps are folded along the outside of the folded 
upper flaps and the extremity ends of the outermost overlapped lower 
flaps are folded along the upper surface of the contents, and lengths of 
adhering tape fed out by the tape feeding mechanism are adhered to the 
upper surface of the contents together with the extremities end of the 
lower flaps by an adhering mechanism and sealed. A similar machine is disclosed in Swiss Patent Specification No. 
390776.  
 However, in the prior art packaging machines as described above, 
since the adhering tape is fed out and adhered to the packaging sheet 
upon

<CLAIMS>
A packaging machine in which a packaging sheet (A) is 
wrapped around contents (B) to be packaged by positioning the sheet and 

contents above an elevator (6) in a packaging start position (P1), and by 
moving the elevator (6) relative to the sheet (A) and contents (B) in an 

ascending or descending path, and wherein a length (C1,C2,C2) of 
adhering tape is used to seal the packaging sheet (A), characterized in 

that the machine comprises a packaging sheet positioning mechanism (3) 
for positioning the packaging sheet (A) in a tape receiving position, a 

tape feeding-out mechanism (2a,2b) for feeding-out and supporting 
adhering tape from a supply of such tape, a tape cutting mechanism (2c) 

for cutting the length (C1,C2,C2) of adhering tape from the supply, an 
adhering mechanism (2d) movable toward and away from the packaging 

sheet (A) when in the tape receiving position for adhering the length 
(C1,C2,C2) of adhering tape to the packaging sheet (A) so that part of 

the length of tape projects from the sheet (A), and a sheet feeding-out 
mechanism (4a,4b) for supplying the packaging sheet (A) with the length 

of tape adhered thereto along a feeding-out passage (A') from the tape 
receiving position to the packaging start position (P1). 
A packaging machine according to Claim 1 in which the 
packaging sheet (A) is wound around the contents (B) into tubular form, 

and the adhering mechanism (2d) is adapted to apply the length 
(C1,C2,C2) of tape to 
the leading end (A1') only of the packaging sheet 
(A), which leading end (A1') is arranged to overlie the trailing end (A2) 

when the sheet (A) is wrapped into tubular form around the contents (B).  
 
A packaging machine according to Claim 2, in which the sheet 
feeding-out mechanism (3) is controlled in such a manner that when the 

wrapping operation is carried out, regardless of the size of the packaging 
sheet (A) for the contents (B), the leading and trailing ends (A1,A2) of 

the overlapped packaging sheet (A) at the outside of the contents (B) are 
arranged at the central position of the contents (B). 
A packaging machine according to Claim 2 or 3, wherein 
additional lengths of tape (C2,C2) are applied to the sheet (A) at the 

sides thereof for holding each of the extended ends (A3) of the 
packaging sheet (A) projecting in a rectangular tubular form from the 

side surfaces (B2) of the contents (B) and for sealing the said extended 
ends (A3) when folded over the side surfaces (B2) of the contents (B).
