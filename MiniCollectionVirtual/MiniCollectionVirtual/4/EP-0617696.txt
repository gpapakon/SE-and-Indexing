<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing high purity anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF) having low levels of oxidizable impurities by electrolytically oxidizing the impurities. Specifically, trivalent arsenic impurity in the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is oxidized to a non-volatile pentavalent arsenic compound. The resultant solution is distilled to recover high purity anhydrous hydrogen fluoride with low levels of arsenic impurity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of high purity anhydrous 
hydrogen fluoride with low levels of oxidizable impurities. More specifically but 
not by way of limitation, this invention deals with a manufacturing process which 
involves oxidizing the volatile trivalent arsenic impurity to a non-volatile arsenic 
pentavalent compound using alternating current in an electrolytic cell. The 
resulting mixture is distilled to recover high purity anhydrous hydrogen fluoride 
with very low levels of arsenic, water and other oxidizable impurities. Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is formed by heating a mixture of 
fluorspar and sulfuric acid. The main impurities in the prepared hydrogen 
fluoride are flurosulfonic acid, silicon tetrafluoride, sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid 
and water. These impurities are usually removed by fractional distillation, and 
the resulting anhydrous hydrogen fluoride has a purity of about 99.8% or better. 
However, the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride thus obtained still contains unacceptable 
quantities of undesirable impurities such as arsenic. The amount of 
arsenic impurity which is present in the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride depends on 
the amount of arsenic-bearing impurities in the fluorspar used to prepare the 
anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The anhydrous hydrogen fluoride generally contains about 20 to 
600 part per million (ppm) of arsenic impurity. The presence of this impurity at 
these levels is undesirable for many applications. Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride 
is extensively used as a fluorinating agent in the production of organic and 
inorganic chemicals, and in the refining of metals. The presence of arsenic 
impurities in the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride can poison catalysts, contaminate 
products and cause severe equipment corrosion. Several processes have been proposed to remove arsenic 
impurities from anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Among these are processes which 
involve multiple fractional distillation. However, such methods are not 
considered to be economical for producing commercial quantities.  
 For example, in U.S. Patent 3,687,622 the distillation of impure 
anhydrous hydrogen fluoride containing 1200 ppm As at very high pressures 
(e.g., > 115 psia and preferably > 165 psia) is disclosed wherein the As is 
removed overhead and purified hydrogen fluoride (e.g., <3,000 ppb and 
preferably <100 ppb As) is recovered as bottoms product. In U.S. Patent 
3,663,382 As impurities are removed from anhydrous hydrogen fluoride by 
distillation at a pressure below 25 psia with
