<ABSTRACT>
The described apparatus comprises a suction unit (2) 
detachably mounted on a support platform (12) provided 

with four wheels (37) to be operated independently by 
corresponding movement motors (36). The movement motors 

(36) are governed by an electronic control unit (35), 
driven by a receive unit (33) based on radio pulses 

(32a) transmitted by a transmit unit (32) operable 
manually by an operator. The suction unit (2) can be 

disengaged from the support platform (12) and associated 
with an auxiliary handgrip (53) for manual use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical apparatus 
for cleaning surfaces by suction, of the type comprising 
the features recited in the preamble of claim 1. The apparatus in question is especially conceived for 
carrying out cleaning operations on floors, fitted 
carpets and carpets in dwelling premises, business 
premises and the like. It is known that there are currently many types of 
surface-cleaning apparatus, such as vacuum-cleaners, 
electric brooms or the like that are adapted to collect 
dust and other particles laid down on said surfaces by a 
suction effect produced upon the action of a fan. In more detail, there are many vacuum-cleaners in which 
the fan operated by a motor powered through the mains, 
draws air from a collection container defined within the 
vacuum-cleaner structure or, in other cases, consisting  
 
of a bag made of a porous material and suitably housed 
in a chamber formed in said structure. One end of a flexible wrinkled pipe opens into the 
collection container, the other pipe end being 
connected, upon interposition of handgrips and/or 
tubular extensions of the stiff type, to a brush or 
other appliance exhibiting an inlet through which, upon 
the action of the air stream produced by the fan, the 
material laying on the surface to be cleaned is sucked 
and conveyed to the collection container. There are also electric brooms exhibiting a handle 
provided with a handgrip to which the casing housing the 
fan and the corresponding driving motor is directly 
connected, said driving motor being powered by storage 
batteries of the rechargeable type accommodated in the 
casing. The fan carries out suction of the air through 
an inlet that, upon interposition of a filtering 
element, communicates with the inside of a collection 
container. Opening into said container is a suction 
duct connected to a brush designed to act on the surface 
to be cleaned. The foregoing being stated, it will be noted that any 
known type of vacuum cleaner, electric broom or other 
suction apparatus involves problems in terms of 
efficiency and practical use essentially due to the fact 
that a manual action is required on the part of the 
operator for pushing and dragging along the brush or 
other accessory designed to collect dust by suction, 
over the surface to be cleaned. In this respect it will 
be also recognized that in order to enable an operator 
to control the movements of the brush while he is 
standing, the brush must be connected to the handgrip 
by interposition of a stiff
