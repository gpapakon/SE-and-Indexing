<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a methine compound and
a silver halide photographic material comprising the
methine compound wherein the storage stability of the material
is improved and wherein in particular a change in sensitivity after
the preparation of the coating solution with the passage of time
is reduced, i.e., of the coating solution used for the photographic
material. 
More particularly, it relates to a
methine dye having a benzoxazole nucleus having a
halogen-substituted aryl group at the 5-position and a
silver halide photographic material comprising the
methine dye.Spectral sensitization is a very important,
essential technique in the preparation of high-sensitivity
and stable silver halide photographic
materials. Many spectral sensitizers have been developed,
and the practical application methods of them with
regard to, for example, supersensitization methods,
addition methods, have been developed.Conventional spectral sensitizing dyes used in
conducting spectral sensitization include spectral
sensitizers such as cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes and
rhodacyanine dyes. It is known that these spectral
sensitizers are used either alone or in combination
(e.g., for the purpose of supersensitization). The sensitizing dyes used in photographic
materials must meet many requirements. For example, not
only high spectral sensitivity can be provided, but also
fog is not to be increased. It is necessary that the
sensitizing dyes have excellent exposure characteristics
(e.g., latent image stability, reciprocity law characteristics,
temperature or humidity dependency during
exposure), hardly cause a change in sensitivity, gradation
and fog during the storage of the photographic
materials before exposure and are not left behind in the
photographic materials after processing.Particularly, it is an essential factor that the
sensitizing dyes are highly stable during the storage of
the photographic materials. Many attempts have been
made to provide sensitizing dyes satisfying the above
requirements.Conventionally, photographic emulsions containing
oxacarbocyanine dyes alone (e.g., described in U.S.
Patents 2,173,486, 2,521,706 and 3,044,875, and JP-A-63-167348
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application")),
photographic emulsions containing a combination of oxacarbocyanine
dyes and imidadicarbocyanine dyes (e.g.,
described in JP-A-59-116646, JP-A-59-116647, JP-A-59-140443
and JP-A-59-149346) and photographic emulsions 
containing a combination of two or more of
