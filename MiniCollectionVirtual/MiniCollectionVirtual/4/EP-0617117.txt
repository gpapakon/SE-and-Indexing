<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a composition comprising a major amount of an oil 
of lubricating viscosity, and (A) an organic ammonium thiosulfate. The lubricating 

composition is either free of added lead containing compounds or additionally 
contains (B) a phosphorus or boron antiwear/extreme pressure agent, or both. The 

invention also includes greases and aqueous fluids containing organic ammonium 
thiosulfates. These compositions have improved antiwear, antiweld, extreme pressure 

and/or friction properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions containing organic, i.e., carbon 
containing, ammonium thiosulfate. These compositions include lubricating 
compositions, greases, and aqueous fluids. Lubricating compositions, greases, and aqueous fluids are used to maintain a 
film of lubricant between surfaces which are moving with respect to each other. The 
compositions prevent contact of the moving surfaces thus preventing harmful wear to 
the surfaces. The compositions generally also lower the coefficient of friction. To 
be effective, the compositions must have sufficient antiwear, antiweld, and extreme 
pressure properties to prevent metal-to-metal contact under high load conditions. 
There is a desire to have a material or combinations of materials which provide 
lubricating compositions with antiwear, antiweld, extreme pressure and/or friction 
properties. One problem associated with boundary lubrication occurs under high speed, 
shock loading conditions. Under these conditions, the lubricant is exposed to a quick 
heavy load which may cause metal-to-metal contact. The L-42 high speed, shock 
loading test measures a lubricants ability to protect under high speed, shock loading 
conditions. U.S. Patent 3,505,222, issued to Niebylski relates to lubricant compositions 
having extreme pressure wear properties. The lubricants contain a synergistic 
mixture of a thiosulfate compound and a lead compound. The thiosulfates include 
metal thiosulfates and quaternary ammonium thiosulfates. The lead compounds 
include lead naphthenate, lead imidazole, lead isodecyl xanthogenate, lead oleate, lead 
stearate, lead sulfide, and lead octyl xanthogenate.  U.S. Patent 4,923,625 relates to lubricant compositions with improved extreme 
pressure and antiwear properties which contain a mixture of a metal thiosulfate and 
a metal phosphate. This invention relates to a composition comprising a major amount of an oil 
of lubricating viscosity, and (A) an organic ammonium thiosulfate. The lubricating 
composition is either free of added lead containing compounds or additionally 
contains (B) a phosphorus or boron antiwear/extreme pressure agent, or both. The 
invention also includes greases and aqueous fluids containing organic ammonium 
thiosulfates. These compositions have improved antiwear, antiweld, extreme pressure 
and/or friction properties. Various preferred features and embodiments of the present invention 
will now be described by way of non-limiting example. The term 'hydrocarbyl" includes hydrocarbon as well as
