<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a portable object and the method for manufacturing such an object. The portable object including in a plastic support (2) a cavity (26, 27) intended to receive a micromodule assembly including a conductive wafer (11) which includes areas which are electrically insulated from one another and which is connected electrically to a semiconductor integrated circuit (13) which includes at least one storage function, is characterised in that the cavity (26, 27) has a contour (261, 271) shaped as a succession of adjoining arcs of small amplitude relative to a contour mid-line whose shape matches the shape of the wafer, the said contour of the housing forming a rake of 10 degrees relative to a direction perpendicular to the surface of the support (2).

Portable object comprising, in a support (2) made of plastic material, a
cavity (26, 27) intended to receive a micromodule assembly comprising a

conducting pellet (11) comprising zones that are electrically insulated from one
another and to which is electrically connected an integrated circuit (13) with

semiconductor comprising at least one memory function, characterised in that
the cavity (26, 27) has a contour (261, 271) shaped as a succession of

contiguous arcs of small amplitude relative to an average contour line with a
shape adapted to the shape of the pellet, said contour of the cavity forming a

relief angle of 10 degrees relative to a direction perpendicular to the surface of
the support (2), this relief angle widening the cavity towards the bottom.
Portable object according to Claim 1, characterised in that the cavity (26,
27) comprises two recesses, concentric or otherwise, of which a first (26), with

a surface area greater than the second, has a depth less than the second one.
Portable object according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the first
recess (26) has a depth (P) less than the sum of the thickness (e
1
) of the
conducting pellet (11) and the thickness (e
2
) of the heat-fusible strip (12)
associated with the conducting pellet.
Portable object according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the angle
of the relief and the depth (P) of the first recess (26) are calculated so as to

absorb the volume of heat-fusible glue corresponding to the difference in
dimension between the depth (P) of the first recess and the thickness (e
1

)
of the pellet/heat-fusible strip assembly (11, 12).
Portable object according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the depth
(P) is less by 0.05 to 2 hundredths of a millimetre. 
Portable object according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the depth
(P) is less by 2 hundredths of a millimetre.
Portable object according to one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the integrated circuit (13) is fixed in the second recess (27) by a semi-fast-setting

glue loaded with elastomer.
Portable object according to Claim 7, characterised in that the glue is of
the cyanacrylic type.
Portable object according to Claim 7, characterised in that the glue is a
resin.
Portable object according to Claim 1, characterised in that the pellet (11)
is fixed in a first housing (26) by a heat-fusible glue.
Portable object according to Claim 1, characterised in that the ends of
the arcs define a contour, the dimensions of which, relative to the dimensions

of the average line of contour, are reduced by a value comprised between
1/1000th and 10/1000ths.
Portable object according to Claim 11, characterised in that the
dimensions are reduced preferably by 3/1000ths.
Method of manufacturing portable objects according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that it comprises:


a step of measuring, with the aid of a laser beam, the thickness of
material forming the support (2) of the card in which a cavity (26, 27) has to be

hollowed out in order to receive the micromodule assembly (11, 12, 13); 
a step of calculating the distance of descent of a milling spindle
(52) relative to a fixed plane constituted by the upper surface of the support (2)

forming the card;
a step of controlling the displacements of a dovetail milling cutter (53),
the dovetail of which corresponds to the angle of the relief of the cavity (26, 27)

so as to form the contour (261, 271) shaped as a succession of contiguous
arcs;
a step of gluing the micromodule assembly (11, 12, 13) to the support
(2).
Method according to Claim 13, characterised in that the gluing step
comprises a step of depositing a defined quantity of semi-fast-setting glue in

the second recess (27) of the cavity in order to ensure the fixing of the
integrated circuit (13) with semiconductor of the micromodule assembly.
Method according to Claim 13 or 14, characterised in that the gluing step
further comprises a step of heating the conducting pellet (11) comprising zones

electrically insulated from one another and provided with a heat-fusible strip

Method according to one of Claims 13 to 15, characterised in that it
comprises, prior to the fixing of the integrated circuit (13) with semiconductor, a

step of depositing a heat-fusible strip (12), provided with cut-outs big enough to
surround the semiconductor (13) on the conducting strip, which comprises a

obstructed by a receiving cup (81) intended to receive the mechanically

deformed micromodule.
Method according to one of Claims 16 or 17, characterised in that the
micromodule assembly positioned on a cup (81) is brought to a station for

positioning in the cavity (26, 27) of the support (2) so as to ensure, by action of
the pusher (82), the descent of the micromodule into the cavity arranged

opposite the concavity of the cup, of a dimension smaller than the dimension of
the contour of the housing provided in the support (2).
