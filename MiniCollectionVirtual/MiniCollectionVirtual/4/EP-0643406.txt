<ABSTRACT>
A distribution transformer has a wound magnetic core (50) of overall circular shape and 
rectangular cross-section with between two and four overall rectangular shape electric coils (20, 

30) extending through the core window. The coils (20, 30) are pre-formed and assembled so that 
their parts (20A, 30A) which meet form a circular section solid cylinder. A mandrel (40) is then 

located around this cylinder (20A, 30A). Amorphous steel strip is first wound on to another 
mandrel, annealed, and then transferred from the other mandrel on to the mandrel around the 

coils.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical power distribution transformers. In particular the 
invention relates to methods of making such distribution transformers of the type which include 
a core and coil assembly having a wound magnetic core with a central window and one or more 
electric coils which extend through said core window, and to the transformers so made. Two known methods of making a transformer core and coil assembly of the above-defined 
type, and in which the core is of overall rectangular shape, will now be described. In the first such known method the wound core is made by winding magnetic steel strip 
of single width into a circular roll, and in winding each turn it is cut at approximately the same 
point. The circular roll is then pressed into an overall rectangular shape core having distributed 
gaps through one side of the rectangle where the turns were cut, and it is then annealed to fix the 
rectangular shape. The cut core turns are then opened up and bent out to form a U-shape, a pre-formed 
rectangular cylindrical coil is assembled on each of the two legs of the U-shape, and the 
cut core turns are then closed to re-form the rectangular core shape and are jointed. However 
well the cuts are jointed they will add significantly to the power loss of the core. Also with this 
method, the machinery for cutting the magnetic steel strip involves significant cost. Furthermore 
the present and expected future trend is to use progressively thinner magnetic steel strip which 
has inherently lower power loss, but thinner strip is more difficult to handle in processes which 
involve cutting. Another disadvantage of this method is that the equipment and process involved 
in annealing the core contributes significantly to the cost of manufacturing the transformer.  
 In the second known method of making a rectangular shape wound core transformer, 
magnetic steel strip of varying width is wound continuously without cuts on to a rectangular 
mandrel to form an overall rectangular shape core with an approximately circular cross-section. 
The core is then annealed to fix the rectangular shape. Split mandrels are then fitted over two legs 
of the core and a circular cylindrical coil is wound on to each mandrel. This second method 
avoids the manufacturing and power loss disadvantages associated with cutting in the above-described 
first method. However there is still the cost disadvantage of annealing the core. There 
are two further disadvantages of this second method. Firstly the only approximately

A method of making an electrical power distribution transformer which includes a core 
and coil assembly having a wound magnetic core (50) with a central window and electric coils 

(20, 30) which extend through said core window, the method including the steps of: 

(i) individually pre-forming each of a number of overall rectangular shape said electric 
coils (20, 30) so that said coil has a sector of a circle cross-section at least where it will pass 

through the core window, 
(ii) assembling the pre-formed coils together so that their circle sector cross-sectioned 
parts combine to form a circular section solid cylinder (20A, 30A) where they meet, and 
(iii) rotating a core wound from single width amorphous steel strip on to said circular 
section solid cylinder to form thereon an uncut said wound magnetic core having overall circular 

shape and rectangular cross-section, with said core window substantially filled by said coils, the 
method being 
characterised in that
 in step (i) said number of coils is in the range between two and 
four coils, and each said coil is pre-formed by winding electrical conductors (23, 25) on a 

respective support (1A, 1B) which provides a groove (1C) having at least in part the shape of said 
sector of a circle, 
in that
 after step (ii) and before step (iii) the method includes the further steps 
of 
(iv) locating a hollow first circular cylindrical mandrel (40) around said circular section 
solid cylinder, 
(v) rotating at least one second circular cylindrical mandrel having the same external 
diameter as said first mandrel to wind thereon a roll of continuous single or multiple thickness  

 
single width amorphous steel strip, and 
(vi) annealing the or each said roll of amorphous-steel strip under magnetic saturation, 
and 
in that
 step (iii) includes rotating the first and second mandrels to transfer the annealed 
amorphous steel strip as a single roll or up to four stacked co-axial rolls on to the first mandrel 

to form thereon said uncut wound magnetic core. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, in which each said coil (20, 30) is pre-formed by 
winding said electrical conductors (23, 25) on a respective said support (1A, 1B) comprising a 

former made up of sections (1A, 1B), after which the former sections are separated for removal 
of the coil. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, in which said first mandrel (40) is of electrically

A method as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the steel strip forming the wound 
magnetic core is of single thickness. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the wound magnetic core consists 
of a single roll of steel strip. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the transformer is single-phase 
with all said coils extending through only one said core. 
A method as claimed in Claim 6, in which the transformer has two said electric coils each 
having a semi-circular cross-section where it passes through the core window. 
A method or a transformer as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5 in which the transformer  
 

is three-phase and has three said cores (50, 51, 52) and four said coils (20, 30, 21, 31), with each 
core window having two of said coils passing through it and these two coils each having a semi-circular 

cross-section where they pass through this core window.
