<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device making it possible to dry spread-out laundry, which can be folded after use and, if appropriate, serve in this position as an electric radiator. It consists of a hollow basic housing (1) containing a variable electric resistor and a fan which are controlled by a switch (i), making it possible to expel the air through front lateral slits (F), thus functioning as an electric radiator when the two front parts (2) are folded. When these parts (2), which are in the form of hollow doors of lesser width than the housing (1), are unfolded, the face (C) of their outer edges shuts off the slits (F), and the air, thus recovered, will be conveyed among the laundry spread out on the wires (G) by way of the orifices (O) located on the inner faces of (2). The device according to the invention is intended particularly for actively drying spread-out laundry.
