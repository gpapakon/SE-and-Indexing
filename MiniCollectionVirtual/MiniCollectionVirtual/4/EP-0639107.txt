<ABSTRACT>
A dispersion having an aqueous continuous phase is membrane filtrated in one or more membrane filtration steps, where a feeding dispersion fed to a filtration membrane is separated in each step into a retentate retained by the filtration membrane and a permeate passing through said filtration membrane, whereby the retentate from one step can be used, if desired, as a feeding dispersion or a portion thereof in one or more succeeding steps. The permeate resulting from one or more steps is subjected to a concentration to form a concentrated fraction containing an increased concentration of the dry matter or a portion thereof present in the permeate, and this concentrated fraction is returned as a portion of the feeding dispersion in one or more membrane filtration steps. A system for membrane filtration of such dispersion comprises one or more membrane filtration units each associated with a feeding pipe, a retentate exit pipe, and a permeate exit pipe, one or more of the permeate exit pipes (8

<DESCRIPTION>
A system and a process for membrane filtration of a dispersionTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a system for membrane filtration of a dispersion having an aqueous continuous phase, said system comprising one or more membrane filtra- tion units, also called primary membrane filtration units, where each unit is associated with a feeding pipe, a reten¬ tate exit pipe, and a permeate exit pipe, said retentate exit pipe of one unit, if desired, being coupled to or being the only inlet to the feeding pipe of one or more succeeding units.Furthermore, the invention relates to a process for membrane filtrating a dispersion having an aqueous continuous phase in one or more membrane filtration steps, where a feeding dispersion fed to a filtration membrane is separated in each step into a retentate retained by the filtration membrane and a permeate passing through said filtration membrane, whereby the retentate from one step can be used, if desired, as a feeding dispersion or a portion thereof in one or more succeeding steps.A specific embodiment of the invention relates to a process for regulating milk solids components in concentrated milk products in connection with their manufacture by ultrafil- tration of milk. The concentrated milk products achieved by this embodiment of the invention are preferably intended for the manufacture of cheese, in particular fresh unripened cheese, curd or cheese in brine, such as White Cheese, Feta, Domiaty, Mozzarella, Kaskaval and Kefalotyri.Background Art 

In order to support the understanding of the application some expressions used in the present specification and claims have been defined below.Membrane filtration: Filtration through a membrane where a dispersion, here called a feed dispersion, is separated into a retentate not passing through the membrane and a permeate passing through said membrane. The retentate is a fluid dispersion in which the amount of dispersing phase has been increased relative to the amount thereof in the feed dispersion. Examples of membranes to be used by the membrane filtration are MF, UF, NF, and RO membranes, which have been defined in greater detail below.Retentate: The fraction of a feed dispersion which is retained by a filtration membrane.Permeate: The fraction of a feed dispersion which passes through a filtration membrane.Microfiltration (MF): Filtration through an MF-membrane, i.e. a membrane of a pore size of 0.08 μm to 2.5 μm corresponding to a molecular cutoff value of 150000 to 5 000000.Ultra iltration (UF): Filtration
