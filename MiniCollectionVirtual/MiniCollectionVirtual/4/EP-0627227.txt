<ABSTRACT>
A bone inducing material comprising a piezoelectric 
porous membrane having through-holes of an average pore size 

of about 0.1 to 5 µm is disclosed. When the bone inducing 
material according to the present invention is used, bone is 

rapidly regenerated, and new formation of bone occurs. The 
bone inducing material is particularly useful in the dental 

field, for example, for treatment of periodontal diseases by 
GTR method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bone inducing 
material, more particularly, to a bone inducing material 
composed of a piezoelectric porous membrane having through-holes 
of an average diameter of 0.1 to 5 µm. Since it was found that there exists a piezoelectric 
phenomenon in bone, various experimental and clinical 
attempts to increase bone production by electrically 
stimulating the bone have been reported. As examples of 
making use of a piezoelectric sheet, in particular, there 
were reported that callus formation was observed by wrapping 
a polyfluoroethylene electret film around the thigh bone of 
rabbits (Fukada et al., Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 14, 1975, 2079); 
that callus was successfully formed by wrapping a poly-γ-methyl 
L-glutamate piezoelectric film around the thigh bone 
of rabbits; and that callus formation was observed by 
wrapping a polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric electret 
film around the thigh bone of monkeys and so on (Fukada, Jpn. 
J. Appl. Phys., 48 (4), 1979, 381-386). In the above 
reports, the site where bone production was desired was 
covered with a piezoelectric sheet and bone production was 
promoted by electrical stimulus with the piezoelectric sheet. In the dental field, the guided tissue regeneration 
technique (GTR technique) has been developed as a means of 
artificially regenerating periodontium destroyed by 
periodontal diseases such as alveolar abscesses. In GTR 
technique, a semi-permeable membrane with a high bioaffinity 
is used to prevent an epithelial tissue from downwards 
growing and, on the other hand, promote the activation of 
periodontal cells and expect the formation of new bone. 
Thus, it is considered that the the newly formed bone can be 
attached to the existing bone tissue. The narrowing of the 
alveolar border caused by bone resorption and bone defects in 
the jawbone and alveolar bone obstruct prosthesis in dentures  
 
and implants. In these cases, it has become possible to 
promote new bone formation by the GTR method. More 
particularly, the entry of the epithelial tissue to the area 
around the implant is prevented by the membrane, and 
cells and capillary blood vessels are selectively induced and 
regenerated in the space obtained by the membrane (see 
Nakamura, the Quintessence, Vol. 9, No. 11, pp. 47 - 54, 
1990). The membrane used in the GTR method is a porous 
membrane such as a Millipore filter or an expanded 
polyethylene tetrafluoride membrane (Gore-Tex membrane). 
Recently, the use of biodegradable polylactic acid membranes 
has
