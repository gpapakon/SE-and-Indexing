<ABSTRACT>
There is provided an electricity/air pressure converter 
which is highly stable, compact and inexpensive. The 

converter includes a pair of housings (32,33) made of a soft 
magnetic material in the middle of which pole pieces (34,42) are 

disposed so that they face each other with an air gap 
therebetween and which have a cylindrically formed outer 

circumferential portion, a permanent magnet (36) secured to one (32) 
of the housings at one end thereof so that it surrounds one 

of the pole pieces (34), a movable member (37) made of a magnetic 
material having spring properties which is secured to the 

other end of the permanent magnet (36) and which is disposed so 
that it faces the pole pieces (34,42) in the air gap, a coil (43) which 

is wound around the other housing (33) so that it surrounds the 
pole pieces and through which a current signal flows, and a 

nozzle (35) which is disposed so that it faces the movable member (37) 
around the center of either of the pole pieces (34,42) and which is 

in communication with one end of a restrictor (39) which is 
supplied with a supply air pressure at the other end 

thereof, a nozzle back pressure generated at the nozzle 
according to the current signal being output as an air 

pressure signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electricity/air
pressure converter for converting an electrical signal into
an air pressure signal corresponding thereto and, more
particularly, to an electricity/air pressure converter which
has been improved to be more stable, compact and
inexpensive.Fig. 1 shows a configuration of a conventional
electricity/air pressure converter. Fig. 1(A) is a
longitudinal sectional view and Fig. 1(B) is a right side
view of the same converter. This configuration is disclosed
in Japanese unexamined patent publication No. H4-73401
titled "Electricity/Air Pressure Converter" which will now
be briefly described because the improvements according to
the present invention is made based on this configuration.10 designates a U-shaped permanent magnet having an
upper leg portion 11 which is the n-pole and a lower leg
portion 12 which is the s-pole.Sides 15 and 16 of a pair of U-shaped yokes 13 and 14
made of a soft magnetic material are secured to these leg
portions 11 and 12, respectively, with a constant space LM 
maintained therebetween. Accordingly, leg portions of the
yokes 13 and 14 define spaces A1 and A2 which are equal to
each other.A movable piece 17 made of a soft magnetic material is
disposed so that it extends through the spaces A1 and A2 in
the middle thereof. The movable piece 17 is secured to the
side 15 of the yoke 13 in the vicinity of one end thereof by
means of a spring member 18 made of a non-magnetic material
such as beryllium copper to be rotatable about this point.Thus, the movable piece 17 has a configuration which is
asymmetric about the center thereof and is dynamically off
balance. Therefore, a counter weight 19 is secured to one
end of the yoke 13. In an internal space defined by the
pair of U-shaped yokes 13 and 14 facing each other, a coil
20 is retained so that it surrounds the movable piece 17
with a space maintained therebetween.One side of the other end of the movable piece 17 is
secured with a securing pin 22 through a spring member 21,
and a nozzle 23 is disposed so that it faces the other side
of this end of the movable piece 17 with a small gap
therebetween.This nozzle 23 is supplied with a supply air pressure
Ps through a restrictor 24, and an output air pressure Po is
obtained as a back pressure of the nozzle between the
restrictor 24 and the nozzle 23 through a conduit 25. The operation of the conventional electricity/air
pressure converter having the above-described configuration
will now be described with reference to Fig. 2 illustrating
the
