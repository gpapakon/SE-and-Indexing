<ABSTRACT>
Spiral drill comprising a cylindrical part with two chip 
grooves (15,16) and a principal maximum stiffness direction 

(22,23), an attachment part (30) with larger diameter 
connecting to the cylindrical part at a transition (14), and 

a tip with indexable cutting inserts (12,13), the chip 
grooves spirally encircling the cylindrical part to make the 

principal direction turn an angle C which is at least 110 
degrees and at most 125 degrees.

<DESCRIPTION>
Drills with indexable cutting inserts, comprising one center 
insert and one peripheral insert, are previously known from 
the patent US 4,149,821 and others, and from this it is 
known that suitable choice of cutting angles and the 
location of the inserts relative to each other will make it 
possible to balance the cutting forces so that there is no 
radial force component when all inserts are cutting. When this type of drill is used for drilling of through 
holes, the center insert will cease cutting when the 
peripheral insert is still machining the last part of the 
hole wall. The cutting force on the peripheral insert will 
then no more be balanced, and since it usually has an inward 
radial component, the drill may be deflected inwards and the 
diameter of the last part of the hole be diminished. This is 
especially notable for drills with wide chip grooves, since 
their bending stiffness is low in the direction of the 
grooves. It has been suggested in the patent DE 35 45 586, which 
concerns a drill where there is a large radial force 
component even with both inserts cutting, that the depth of 
the chip grooves should become smaller and the pitch angle 
steeper with increasing distance from the tip. This would 
increase the bending stiffness as the bending moment 
increases. It was also suggested that each chip groove 
should circle preferably 250 - 270 degrees of the drill, 
which would ensure that the bending moment when both inserts 
are cutting would tend to bend the drill in its stiffest 
direction both at the end of the grooves and at a midway 
point where the groove depth is still great. This does not, 
however, indicate that the deflection at the end of a 
through hole is minimized or has a specified direction.  
 From the closest prior art it is known 
a spiral drill comprising a cylindrical part 
with two chip grooves and a principal stiffness 
direction, an attachment part with larger 
diameter connecting to the cylindrical part 
at a transition section, and a tip with 
indexable cutting inserts, one of which is 
a peripheral insert and one a center insert.  
 The present invention concerns an improvement of the above 
mentioned drill with 
indexable cutting inserts, comprising one center insert and 
one peripheral insert, where the improvement consists in 
giving the chip grooves a spiral shape circling the drill 
for such an angle that the cutting force on the peripheral 
insert will cause a minimal radial deflection, allowing 
somewhat larger tangential deflection. As long as the
