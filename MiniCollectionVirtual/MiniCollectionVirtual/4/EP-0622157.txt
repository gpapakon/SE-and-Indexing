<ABSTRACT>
The tool for inserting into a tool holder for powered hand tools used for chiselling and/or percussion drilling has a clamping shank (10) with a polygonal profile and rounded corners (13, 14, 15, 16). Two diametrically opposite profile faces of the clamping shank (10) each have an axially closed locking groove (19). The two further profile faces, likewise diametrically opposite one another, form driving faces (12) serving to transmit torque and having rotary driving grooves (11) which ... further driving faces (17, 18) ...

<CLAIMS>
Tool for insertion into the tool chuck of chiselling and/or 
percussion drilling hand tools comprising a clamping shaft (1, 

10, 20, 30, 40, 50) having at least one axially closed locking 
groove (2, 19, 21, 31, 49, 59) and at least two pickup surfaces 

(3, 12, 17, 18, 22, 32, 38, 42, 47, 48, 52, 57, 58) which deviate 
from a circular contour and are axially open towards the free 

end of the clamping shaft, and the cross-section of the clamping 
shaft (1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) is a polygonal profile with profile 

surfaces, and the pickup surfaces (3, 12, 17, 18, 22, 32, 38, 42, 
47, 48, 52, 57, 58) are arranged in the area of the profile 

surfaces, 
characterised in that
 the polygonal profile has 
rounded corners (4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26, 34, 

36, 43, 44, 45, 46, 53, 54, 55, 56), and the guide contour of the 
clamping shaft (1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) is established by the 

corner dimension of at least two corners (4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 
16, 23, 24, 25, 26, 34, 36, 43, 44, 45, 46, 53, 54, 55, 56), and 

the locking grooves (2, 19, 21, 31, 49, 59) are located in the 
area of the profile surfaces. 
Tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the guide 
contour is formed by at least two diametrically opposite corners 

(4, 6; 5, 7; 13, 15; 14, 16; 23, 25; 24, 26; 34, 36; 43, 45; 44, 46; 
53, 55; 54, 56). 
Tool according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the guide 
contour is formed by four corners (4, 5, 6, 7; 13, 14, 15, 16; 23, 

24, 25, 26; 43, 44, 45, 46; 53, 54, 55, 56) of which two corners 
(4, 6; 5, 7; 13, 15; 14, 16; 23, 25; 24, 26; 43, 45; 44, 46; 53, 55; 

54, 56) are arranged to be diametrically opposite each other. 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 at 
least a portion of the pickup surfaces (17, 18, 38, 47, 48, 57, 58) 

are essentially radially extending areas of rotary pickup grooves 
(11, 37, 41, 51) which are axially open towards the free end of 

the clamping shaft (10, 30, 40, 50).  
 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 
the polygonal profile is in the shape of a square polygon. 
Tool according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the profile 
surfaces of the square polygonal clamping shaft (40) are 

convex. 
Tool according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the profile 
surfaces of the square polygonal of the clamping shaft (50) are 

concave. 
Tool chuck with a receiving opening of a polygonal cross-section 
and a radially transposable locking element for tools 

according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that

cross-section, which corresponds with the cross-section of the 

tool, comprises polygonal surfaces (61, 62) with rounded 
corners (68, 69, 70; 71), and that at least one of the polygonal 

surfaces (61) co-operates with a pickup surface (12) of the 
clamping shaft (10) of the tool, and that another polygonal
