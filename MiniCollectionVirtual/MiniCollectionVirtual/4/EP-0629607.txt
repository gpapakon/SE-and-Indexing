<ABSTRACT>
Compounds containing ester groups and tertiary amino groups and optionally hydroxyl groups, a process for their preparation by reacting optionally hydroxyl-containing acetoacetic acid esters of monohydric or polyhydric alcohols, in particular polyhydric polyether-polyols, with primary/tertiary polyamines, in particular diamines, and their use as catalysts, which can optionally be incorporated, for the isocyanate addition reaction in the production of polyurethane foams by the isocyanate polyaddition process.
