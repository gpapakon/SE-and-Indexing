<DESCRIPTION>
For power supply and many other applications, a high voltage (greater 
than 200 volts) power device which has MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor 
field effect transistor) input control is desirable. Figure 1a illustrates a 
schematic drawing of a conventional vertical power MOSFET and figure 1b 
illustrates a cross-sectional/schematic drawing of a plurality of the devices of 
the type shown in figure 1a as fabricated with a semiconductor. With 
reference to these figures, the gate, source and drain electrodes are 
designated G, S, and D respectively. Gate 2 which can comprise a highly 
doped semiconductor is fabricated over insulator 4 which can comprise oxide. 
This highly doped semiconductor is shown as n+. The + designation 
indicates a higher donor dopant concentration than n-type bulk 
semiconductor region 6. Source electrode S makes contact to highly doped p+ 
semiconductor region 8 through contact 10 which can comprise titanium 
silicide. The p+ designation indicates a higher acceptor dopant concentration 
than p-type well region 12. N+ region 14 serves as the source and contacts 
source electrode S through contact 10. Drain electrode D makes contact to n+ 
semiconductor region 16 which serves as the drain of the MOSFET. In operation, assuming an enhancement mode device, a positive 
voltage placed on gate electrode G, causes a depletion region (not shown) in 
p-type well region 12. In connection with a differential voltage being placed 
on the source electrode S and drain electrode D, according to the voltage at 
the gate electrode G, the depletion region increases to a point where strong 
inversion of the energy bands occur and a channel (not shown) will form 
which allows current to flow between the drain electrode D and the source 
electrode S. The power MOSFET as illustrated in figures 1a and 1b, is widely used 
for the applications previously discussed. However, the input capacitance  
 
per unit area, given the power constraints, particularly at second breakdown 
voltages of greater than 200 volts is large. and thus prevents MOSFET 
operation at several megahertz. Figure 1a illustrates a schematic drawing of a conventional power 
MOSFET. Figure 1b illustrates a cross-sectional/schematic drawing of a plurality 
of MOSFETS of the type shown in figure 1a as fabricated with a 
semiconductor. Figure 2a illustrates a schematic drawing of an integrated power 
cascode according to the invention. Figure 2b illustrates a cross-sectional/schematic drawing of a plurality 
of MOSFETS of the type shown in
