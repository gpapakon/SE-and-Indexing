<ABSTRACT>
A gas discharge lamp ballast with an indicator of operability of the ballast is 
disclosed. The ballast circuit comprises circuitry for providing a d.c. bus 

voltage on a bus conductor with respect to a ground, and a resonant load 
circuit. The resonant load circuit includes lamp terminals for connecting to 

a removable gas discharge lamp, a resonant inductor, and a resonant 
capacitor. The resonant inductor and resonant capacitor are selected to set 

a magnitude, and resonant frequency, of a bidirectional current in the lamp. 
Further included is a converter circuitry, including first and second serially 

connected switches coupled between the bus conductor and the ground, and 
providing to the resonant load circuit, at a node coupled between the first and 

second switches, a voltage that alternates between first and second voltage 
levels. Circuitry for generating first and second switch control signals for 

alternately switching into conduction the first and second switches, including 
circuitry responsive to a feedback signal representing a current in the 

resonant load circuit, are further included. The ballast circuit, moreover, 
includes overload detection circuitry for detecting if voltage applied to the 

lamp terminals exceeds an overload level; and circuitry for indicating, in 
response to such an overload condition being detected by the overload 

detection circuitry, probable operability of the ballast circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lamp ballast,
or power supply, circuit for a gas discharge lamp, and,
more particularly to such a ballast circuit that
includes an indicator of ballast operability.An emerging class of compact gas discharge lamps
employs a standard Edison-type screw base, for
installation in a conventional lamp socket that can
also accommodate incandescent lamps. Such compact gas
discharge lamps comprise low pressure fluorescent lamps
that employ a multi-axis envelope, or discharge vessel,
in which light is emitted from a suitable fill that is
electrically excited to a discharge state. The power
supply, or as more conventionally known, "ballast"
circuit for such a compact fluorescent lamp typically
has an expected lifetime of four or more times that of
the mentioned multi-axis envelope and any associated
circuitry. It would, therefore, be desirable to
provide a gas discharge lamp ballast circuit that
includes an indicator of operability of the ballast
circuit. In this way, the ballast circuit can be saved
for re-use with a removable gas discharge lamp.As the present inventors have discovered, an
indicator of operability of a lamp ballast circuit can
beneficially be coupled to the output of a circuit for
sensing an overload condition of voltage on terminals
for connecting to a lamp (hereinafter, "lamp
terminals"). Such sensing circuitry is typically used
with a.shut-down circuit for terminating the supply of
voltage to the lamp terminals. A typical prior art 
overload sensing circuit, however, suffers from the
drawback of only detecting one of the positive or
negative excursions of lamp voltage. Such circuit may,
therefore, fail to sense excessive excursions of lamp
voltage in the other polarity, wherein the lamp is
operating in a so-called rectification mode; such mode
may occur, for instance, where one of the lamp cathodes
has become damaged. Continued operation of the lamp in
a rectification mode places above-normal stress on the
components of the ballast circuit, and thereby risks
reduced ballast life.It would, therefore, be desirable to provide a gas
discharge lamp ballast circuit that includes a circuit
for sensing an overload condition of voltage on the
lamp terminals, including a rectification mode failure
of the lamp.A gas discharge lamp ballast circuit employing a
prior art overload sense circuit, as described above,
relates the use of a pair of switches that are
alternately switched into a conduction state, for
providing bidirectional current to a resonant load
circuit
