<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to pharmaceutical formulations containing human growth hormone (hGH). More particularly, this invention relates to such pharmaceutical formulations having increased stability in aqueous formulation.Human growth hormone formulations known in the art are all lyophilized preparations requiring reconstitution. Per vial, Protropin® hGH consists of 5 mg hGH, 40 mg mannitol, 0.1 mg monobasic sodium phosphate, 1.6 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, reconstituted to pH 7.8 (Physician's Desk Reference, Medical Economics Co., Orawell, NJ, p. 1049, 1992). Per vial, Humatrope® hGH consists of 5 mg hGH, 25 mg mannitol, 5 mg glycine, 1.13 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, reconstituted to pH 7.5 (Physician's Desk Reference, p. 1266, 1992).For a general review for growth hormone formulations, see Pearlman et al., Current Communications in Molecular Biology, eds. D. Marshak and D. Liu, pp. 23-30, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989. Other publications of interest regarding stabilization of proteins are as follows.U.S. 4,297,344 discloses stabilization of coagulation factors II and VIII, antithrombin III, and plasminogen against heat by adding selected amino acids such as glycine, alanine, hydroxyproline, glutamine, and aminobutyric acid, and a carbohydrate such as a monosaccharide, an oligosaccharide, or a sugar alcohol.U.S. 4,783,441 discloses a method for the prevention of denaturation of proteins such as insulin in aqueous solution at interfaces by the addition of up to 500 ppm surface-active substances comprising a chain of alternating, weakly hydrophilic and weakly hydrophobic zones at pH 6.8-8.0.U.S. 4,812,557 discloses a method of stabilization of interleukin-2 using human serum albumin.European Patent Application Publication No. 0 303 746 discloses stabilization of growth promoting hormones with polyols consisting of non-reducing sugars, sugar alcohols, sugar acids, pentaerythritol, lactose, water-soluble dextrans, and Ficoll, amino acids, polymers of amino acids having a charged side group at physiological pH, and choline salts.European Patent Application Publication No. 0 211 601 discloses the stabilization of growth promoting hormones in a gel matrix formed by a block copolymer containing polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene units and having an average molecular weight of about 1,100 to about 40,000.European Patent Application Publication No. 0 193 917 discloses a biologically active composition for slow release characterized by a water solution of a complex
