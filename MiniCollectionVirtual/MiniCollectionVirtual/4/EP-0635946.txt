<ABSTRACT>
The analogue-digital converter receives an analogue input signal (x(t)) to produce a digital offset signal (y(t)). It comprises a subtracter (1) for forming the difference between the input signal and a reference signal (Ur(t)), a series of conversions (2, 3, 4) for producing the offset signal from this difference, and a feedback loop for producing the reference signal by means of a digital-analogue converter (5) which delivers a comparison signal (Uc(t)) in response to the offset signal. According to the invention, with the input signal (x(t)) having a central frequency (f0), the feedback loop comprises a shifter stage (7) for shifting the frequency response of the digital-analogue converter (5) from the zero frequency towards the central frequency (f0), this shifter stage producing the reference signal (Ur(t)) from the comparison signal (Uc(t)).

Analogue-to-digital converter receiving an analogue
input signal (x(t)) to produce a digital error signal (y(t))

comprising a subtractor (1) to calculate the difference
between said input signal and a reference signal (Ur(t)), a

converter subsystem (2, 3, 4) to produce said error signal
from said difference and a feedback loop to produce said

reference signal by means of a digital-to-analogue converter
(5) which delivers a comparison signal (Uc(t)) in response to

said error signal, characterised in that, said input signal
(x(t)) being assigned a centre frequency (f
0
), said feedback
loop comprises a displacement unit (7) for displacing the

frequency response of said digital-to-analogue converter (5)
from the null frequency towards said centre frequency (f
0

comparison signal (Uc(t)) by means of a modulating signal

(md(t)).
Analogue-to-digital converter according to claim 2
characterised in that said modulating signal (md(t)) has a

spectral component at a modulation frequency (f
m
) equal to
said centre frequency (f

characterised in that said reference signal (Ur(t)) is the

product of said comparison signal (Uc(t)) and said modulating
signal (md(t)).
Analogue-to-digital converter according to claim 4
characterised in that said converter subsystem comprises a

sampler (3) operating at a sampling frequency (f
e
