<ABSTRACT>
Device installable on hygienic-sanitary plants like the 
hygienic toilets, to permit different water volumes to be 

discharged depending on the type of human waste discharged on 
the toilet. Device including valve means (16, 17; 26, 27; 30; 

39; 43; 552; 58, 59) arranged on conduits (18, 18; 24; 25; 
37, 38) entering at different levels the reservoir (13) 

collecting the drainage water, which are operable selectively 
by manual push buttons or automatically. 
Different versions of such valve means are provided, 
associated with the reservoir (13), with a box-like unit (42) 

interposed between such reservoir and the toilet, or directly 
with the same toilet, by providing in this case suitable 

sensor means (551, 554) arranged inside the same toilet and 
intercepting the discharged wastes, in order to select the 

drainage adjusted to the respective type of discharged waste.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a selective water distribution 
device for hygienic-sanitary plants like the toilets with 
water reservoirs, adapted to permit the water distribution to 
such plants to be metered depending on the actual need of the 
same water for cleaning said plants. As it is known, the present hygienic-sanitary plants like the 
toilets with water reservoirs are provided with toilets 
connected by means of ducts to underground sewer systems, for 
the drainage of the human excrement, as well as reservoirs of 
adequate capacity disposed at a position above the respective 
toilets and operating by water falling, which water is 
contained within such reservoirs and is introduced therein 
through proper water mains, at pre-established and invariable 
amounts, so as such amounts be able to insure always an 
effective drainage of all the excrement materials of the 
persons. These reservoirs are provided with suitable 
automatic regulating mechanisms for admitting water into the 
same reservoirs, generally having floating means, associated 
with sealing valve mechanisms, which are operated by means of 
manual operating push buttons and adapted to permit all the 
water amount contained within each reservoir to be drained in 
the toilet below it whenever cleaning of the excrement 
materials from this latter is required. In this way, it is 
evident that the water amount for cleaning is always the same 
for each type of waste materials to be drained, is it a 
matter of both the urines and solid excrement which normally 
are respectively emitted several times or once a day only, 
while for these functions on the contrary it would be needed 
limited water amounts, in the first case, and higher ones in 
the second case. Consequently, the present hygienic-sanitary 
plants do not allow to use on an optimum manner the water 
amounts being stored on the associated reservoirs of such 
plants, rather they involve water consumptions higher than 
those actually required, and thus need also higher electric  
 
energy consumptions for power supply of the aqueduct pumping 
plants for the distribution of a greater water amount through 
the hydraulic plants connected to said reservoirs. Therefore, it would be desirable, and is the object of the 
present invention, to provide a selective water distribution 
device for hygienic - sanitary plants of the above mentioned 
kind, and in particular for hygienic toilets having 
respective reservoirs for containing water for cleaning the 
same toilets, adapted to eliminate the
