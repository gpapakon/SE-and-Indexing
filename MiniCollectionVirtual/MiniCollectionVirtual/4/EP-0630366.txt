<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to substituted
heterocyclic derivatives which inhibit platelet
aggregation.Fibrinogen is a glycoprotein present as a
normal component of blood plasma. It participates in
platelet aggregation and fibrin formation in the blood
clotting mechanism.Platelets are cellular elements found in whole
blood which also participate in blood coagulation.
Fibrinogen binding to platelets is important to normal
platelet function in the blood coagulation mechanism.
When a blood vessel receives an injury, the platelets
binding to fibrinogen will initiate aggregation and form
a thrombus. Interaction of fibrinogen with platelets
occurs through a membrane glycoprotein complex, known as
gpIIb/IIIa; this is an important feature of the platelet
function. Inhibitors of this interaction are useful in
modulating or preventing platelet thrombus formation.It is also known that another large
glycoprotein named fibronectin, which is a major 
extracellular matrix protein, interacts with fibrinogen
and fibrin, and with other structural molecules such as
actin, collagen and proteoglycans. Various relatively
large polypeptide fragments in the cell-binding domain
of fibronectin have been found to have cell-attachment
activity. (See U.S. Patents 4,517,686, 4,589,881, and
4,661,111). Certain relatively short peptide fragments
from the same molecule were found to promote cell
attachment to a substrate when immobilized on the
substrate or to inhibit attachment when in a solubilized
or suspended form. (See U.S. Patents 4,578,079 and
4,614,517).In U.S. Patent 4,683,291, inhibition of
platelet function is disclosed with synthetic peptides
designed to be high affinity antagonists of fibrinogen
binding to platelets. U.S. Patent 4,857,508 discloses
tetrapeptides having utility as inhibitors of platelet
aggregation.Other synthetic peptides and their use as
inhibitors of fibrinogen binding to platelets are
disclosed by Koczewiak et al., Biochem. 23, 1767-1774
(1984); Plow et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 82, 8057-8061
(1985); Ruggeri et al., Ibid. 83, 5708-5712 (1986);

and Ruoslahti and Pierschbacher, Science 238, 491-497
(1987). Still other such inhibitory peptides are
disclosed in EP Patent Applications 275,748 and 298,820.U.S. Patent 4,879,313 discloses compounds
useful as inhibitors of platelet aggregation having the
formula:
