<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
transformation of vanadium/phosphorus mixed oxide 
catalyst precursors into active catalysts for the 
production of maleic anhydride. More particularly, this 
invention relates to a process for the transformation of 
catalyst precursors comprising vanadyl hydrogen phosphate, 
optionally containing a promoter component, into 
active catalysts comprising vanadyl pyrophosphate, also 
optionally containing a promoter component. The active 
catalysts are suitable for the production of maleic 
anhydride via the partial oxidation of nonaromatic 
hydrocarbons in the vapor phase with molecular oxygen or 
a molecular oxygen-containing gas. Maleic anhydride is of significant commercial 
interest throughout the world. It is used alone or in 
combination with other acids in the manufacture of alkyd 
and polyester resins. It also is a versatile intermediate 
for chemical synthesis. Significant quantities 
of maleic anhydride are produced each year to satisfy 
these varied needs. Numerous catalysts containing vanadium, phosphorus, 
and oxygen (sometimes referred to as mixed 
oxides of vanadium and phosphorus), substantially in the 
form of vanadyl pyrophosphate, optionally containing a 
promoter component, are disclosed in the prior art as 
being useful for the conversion of various organic feedstocks 
to maleic anhydride. In general, such catalysts, 
wherein the valence of the vanadium is less than +5, 
usually between about +3.8 and about +4.8, are 
considered as being Particularly well-suited for the 
production of maleic anhydride from saturated hydrocarbons 
having at least four carbon atoms in a straight  
 
chain (or cyclic structure). In many instances, these 
catalysts also contain added promoter elements or components 
which are considered to exist in the catalyst as 
oxides. Common organic feedstocks include nonaromatic 
hydrocarbons such as n-butane, 1- and 2-butenes, 1,3-butadiene, 
or mixtures thereof. Procedures for the preparation of catalysts 
containing the mixed oxides of vanadium and phosphorus, 
optionally containing a promoter component, are also 
disclosed and taught by the prior art. In general, such 
catalysts are prepared by contacting vanadium-containing 
compounds, phosphorus-containing compounds, and promoter 
component-containing compounds (when a promoter element 
is desired) under conditions sufficient to reduce pentavalent 
vanadium to the tetravalent state and form the 
desired catalyst precursor comprising vanadyl hydrogen 
phosphate,
