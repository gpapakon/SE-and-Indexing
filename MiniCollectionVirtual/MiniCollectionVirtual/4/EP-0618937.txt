<DESCRIPTION>
 CARBON-CONTAINING BLACK GLASS MONOLITHS Cross Reference to Related Applications This is a continuation-in-part of USSN 07/002,049 filed January 9, 1987. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCeramics have been known for many hundreds of years and have been used as coatings or as fabricated parts and are employed wherever their characteristics such as durability, nonporosity, electrical conductivity or nonconductivity, and heat protection are required- One of the more recent ceramic materials is a silicon-carbon-oxygen system, named as a black glass, which can find use in certain situations where extremely high temperatures are present. Traditionally, the introduction of carbon in glasses was made by impregnating porous glass with a concentrated solution of an organic compound and subsequently firing in a reducing or neutral atmosphere. The carbon-containing product is generally regarded as a composite containing carbon and silica. Elmer and Meissner (Journal of the American Ceramic Society. 59, 206, 1976) of Corning Glass Works reported that the annealing point of reconstructed 96% silicon dioxide glasses is markedly increased by incorporating carbon in porous glass. Furfury1 alcohol was used as the pyrolyzable organic compound. They attributed the increase of about 100*C in annealing point to the effect of hydroxyl removal from the internal surface of the porous glass by hydroxyl reaction with carbon. The resistivities of samples with less than 2% carbon content approached that of the glass whereas the electrical resistivities of carbon-containing silica with carbon between 4.5-7% are in the range of 1-3 ohm-cm, thus producing electrically conductive glasses. The highest carbon content in the final glasses they could produce is 8.59%. 

 Smith & Crandall reported in ϋ.S Patent 3,378,431 a method of making carbon-containing glass by hot-pressing to sintering temperature a mixture of colloidal silica and an organic compound known in the trade as MCarbowax" (polyethylene glycol) in an oxygen-free atmosphere. The black glass obtained from the mixture of 33% "Carbowax" and 67% silicon dioxide showed the presence of 1.2% by weight of carbon. A devitrification-resistantbondedmass of vitreous silicon dioxide and carbon physically inseparable and microscopically indistinguishable from silica was obtained. The black glass has a low thermal diffusivity and more resistance to crystallization than pure vitreous silica. Devitrification temperature increased by 150*C to 1250*C as compared with colloidal silica.Carbon-modified
