<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spot-welding or crimping machine head of the type comprising an electrode (2) intended, on the one hand, to deliver the welding or crimping current (IS) to a workpiece (component) (6a) to be welded to another (6b) or to be crimped and, on the other hand, to exert a force (F) on the said workpiece (6a) during the welding or crimping operation. It is characterised in that the said force (F) is derived from one or more electromagnetic forces, each of which is generated by the effect of a current (IS, IB) flowing in a conductor (8) immersed in a magnetic field.

Spot welding machine or crimping machine head 
comprising an electrode (3) designed on the one hand to supply the 

welding or crimping current (I
B
) to a part (6a) to be welded to another 
part (6b) or to be crimped and on the other hand to exert a force (F) 

on the said part (6a) during the welding or crimping operation, the said 
force (F) deriving from one or more electromagnetic forces each of 

which is generated by the effect of a current (I
S
, I
B
) circulating in a 
conductor (8) immersed in a magnetic field, characterised in that the 

said magnetic field is generated by an electromagnet (10). 
Head as per claim 1, characterised in that the current 
passing through the said conductor or each conductor (8) is the welding 

current or crimping current (I
S
). 
Head as per claim 1, characterised in that the current 
passing through the said conductor or each conductor (8) is the current 

supplied by a current source (9, 9') controlled by a control and 
actuator unit. 
Head as per one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the winding (10a) of the electromagnet (10) is supplied by a 

current source (11) whose intensity is controlled by a, or the said, 
control and actuator unit. 
Head as per one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the said conductor or each conductor (8) is designed to move in a 

plane intersecting the lines of the said corresponding magnetic field. 
Head as per one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the said conductor or each conductor (8) is designed to pivot in a  

 
plane intersecting the lines of the said corresponding magnetic field. 
Head as per claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the movable 
electrode (3) is integral with the said conductor (8). 
Head as per claim 6, characterised in that the said movable 
electrode (3) is fixed to the free end of the said conductor (8). 
Head as per claim 6, characterised in that the said electrode 
(3) is fixed to the free end of an aim (4) designed to pivot at the same 

time as the said conductor (8). 
Head as per claim 9, characterised in that the said aim (4) 
is isolated electrically from the said conductor (8) and that the ends of 

this conductor (8) are in turn linked to the terminals of a current source 
(9), the said welding current passing through this arm (4).
