<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lock actuable by a lock cylinder, particularly a mortise lock with a toothed drive ring (5) for receiving a lock cylinder (2) freely projecting with its locking bit (3) into a radial clearance (4) of the toothed ring (5), the toothed ring (5) being operatively connected to a locking element (37, 38, 40) via gear elements (29 to 36) and a detent being provided for preventing a displacement of the locking element without the actuation of the cylinder. In order to uncouple the mode of operation of the detent from the espagnolette, provision is made for the detent to have a detaining step (9) which cooperates with a detaining nose (26) and which is assigned to a first (7) of at least two segments (7, 13) of the toothed drive ring (5) which are displaceable coaxially in rotation relative to one another, and for the detent to be rendered inoperative, when the two segments (7, 13) lie one above the other in alignment, as a result of a run-on slope (16) assigned to the second segment (13).

Lock cylinder-operated lock, in particular mortise lock, 
with a driving toothed rim (5) for receiving a lock 

cylinder (2) with its lock ward (3) extending freely into 
a radial recess (4) of the toothed rim (5), wherein the 

toothed rim (5) is operatively connected by gear elements 
(29 to 36) to a locking element (37, 38, 40) and a catch is 

provided to prevent displacement of the locking element 
without cylinder operation,
 characterised in that the catch 
comprises a locking step (9) cooperating with a locking 

projection (26) and associated with a first one (7) of at 
least two coaxially relatively rotatable segments (7, 13) 

of the driving toothed rim (5) and is rendered inoperative 
when the two segments (7, 13) are in the aligned position 

one over the other as a result of an approach ramp (16) 
associated with the second segment (13). 
Lock according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
locking projection (26) is formed by a locking lever 

pivotable about a spindle (28) fixed to the housing. 
Lock according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the locking step (9) is formed by a 

first recess (8) arranged on an untoothed circumferential 
surface section (11) of the first segment (7). 
Lock according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the approach ramp (16) is formed by 

a second recess (14) arranged on an untoothed 
circumferential surface region (13') of the second segment 

(13). 
Lock according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
circumferential extent of the first recess (8) is greater 

than that of the second recess (14).  
 
Lock according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised by a circumferential arrangement of locking 

step (9) and approach ramp (16) such that when the two 
segments (7, 13) are in the aligned position one over the 

other (Figures 1, 3, 5) the approach ramp (16) is arranged 
in front of the locking step (9) in the direction of 

retraction of the lock. 
Lock according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised by a relative displacement of the two 

segments (7, 13) in the circumferential direction to each 
other, which occurs as a result of retraction movement 

without cylinder operation, such that the locking step (9) 
moves to a position over the second recess (14).
