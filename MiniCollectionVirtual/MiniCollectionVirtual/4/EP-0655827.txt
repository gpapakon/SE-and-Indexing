<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a constant voltage generating circuit having step-up 
circuit according to the opening portion of claim 1. EP-A-350 462 discloses a constant voltage generating circuit and a regulation 
of the output voltage of a voltage multiplier, which is configured to detect a 
potential of a high voltage output terminal HV. The value of the current through a clamp circuit is used for the regulation.  
 One example of a known constant voltage generating circuit is disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication JP-A-4-372571. Referring 
to Figure 1A, there is shown a circuit equivalent to the constant voltage 
generating circuit disclosed in this publication JP-A-4-372571, which is 
modified to have a step-up circuit composed of an increased number of 
elements so as to be compared with embodiments of the present invention 
explained hereinafter. This constant voltage generating circuit compromises a 
step-up circuit 50, a clamp circuit 60a, a voltage detecting circuit 70a and a 
clock control circuit 80a. The step-up circuit 50 includes a series-connected N-channel MOSFETs 
(gate-insulated field effect transistor) 51 to 55 each of which has a drain 
electrode and a gate electrode interconnected to each other and which are 
connected between a voltage supply voltage terminal 92 (Vdd) and a high 
voltage output terminal 100 (Vpp). A gate-drain connecting  
 
node of each of the N-channel MOSFETs 52 and 54 is connected through 
a capacitor 56 or 58 to an output of an inverter I51, and a gate-drain 
connecting node of each of the N-channel MOSFETs 53 and 55 is 
connected through a capacitor 57 or 59 to an output of an inverter I52. 
An input of the inverter I51 is connected to a clock input terminal 94 
(5), and an input of the inverter I52 is connected to the output of the 
inverter I51. With this arrangement, a high voltage Vpp is generated with 
a clock signal 5 applied to the clock input terminal 94. The clamp circuit 60a includes a P-channel MOSFET 61 having a 
gate connected to the voltage supply voltage terminal 92 (Vdd) and a 
source electrode connected to the high voltage output terminal 100 (Vpp), 
and an N-channel MOSFET 62 having a drain connected to a drain of the 
P-channel MOSFET 61, a gate connected to the voltage supply voltage 
terminal 92 (Vdd) and a source electrode connected to ground. The voltage detecting circuit 70 is composed of a inverter I71 
having an input connected to a connection node B between the P-channel 
MOSFET 61 and the N-channel MOSFET
