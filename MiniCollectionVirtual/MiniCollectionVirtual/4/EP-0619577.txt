<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-optical recording medium includes a 
first magnetic layer and a second magnetic layer. The 

first magnetic layer is a horizontal magnetization 
layer at room temperature but a perpendicular 

magnetization layer at a raised temperature. A 
transition temperature of the first layer continuously 

or stepwise increases from a light incidence side 
thereof light in a film thickness direction. The 

second magnetic layer is a perpendicular magnetization 
layer both at room temperature and at the raised 

temperature. In reproduction of information, an 
optical beam is applied onto the magneto-optical 

recording medium in which information is recorded by 
directions of magnetization. The information recorded 

in the second magnetic layer is transferred to the 
first magnetic layer and the information is read by the 

magneto-optical effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
magneto-optical recording medium and method for recording or
reproducing information therein with a laser beam by
utilizing the magneto-optical effect. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a
magneto-optical recording medium which can increase the
density of information recorded in the medium and a
method for reproducing information therein.As a rewritable high-density recording method,
attention has been directed to a magneto-optical
recording medium in which magnetic domains are written
on a magnetic thin layer by thermal energy of a
semiconductor laser to record information, and from
which the information is read using the magneto-optical
effect.A recent demand is high to increase a recording
density of the magneto-optical recording medium so as
to provide a larger storage recording medium.A linear recording density of an optical disc
such as the magneto-optical recording medium is
determined mainly by an S/N ratio of a reproduction 
layer, which depends considerably on a bit string cycle
of signal, a laser wavelength of a reproduction optical
system and a numerical aperture of an objective lens.Namely, once a laser wavelength λ of a
reproduction optical system and a numerical aperture NA
of objective lens are determined, a bit cycle f as
being a detection limit is also determined to be λ/2NA.On the other hand, a track density of optical
disc is restricted mainly by cross talk. The cross
talk depends mainly on a distribution (profile) of
laser beam on a surface of the medium and is
represented by a same function of λ/2NA as the
above-mentioned bit cycle is.Accordingly, in order to increase the density
of information to be recorded with a conventional
optical disc, the laser wavelength of reproduction
optical system needs to be shortened and the numerical
aperture NA of objective lens needs to be enlarged.However, there are limitations as to an
improvement in the laser wavelength and an improvement
in the numerical aperture of objective lens.
Therefore, such techniques have been developed that a
structure of recording medium or a reading method is
improved so as to increase the recording density.For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application No. 3-93058 attempted to improve the
recording density by using a medium having a 
reproduction layer and a recording layer. Namely,
magnetization in the reproduction layer is aligned with
one direction before reproducing information, and then
the information held in the recording layer is
transferred to the

a first magnetic layer (3, 4, 5) which has a
magnetization parallel to the layer in a temperature

range up to a transition temperature, and a magnetization

greater than said transition temperature; and
a second magnetic layer (6) which has a
magnetization perpendicular to the layer at least between

the lowest temperature in said temperature range and the

radiation onto the surface of the first layer remote from

the second layer is effective to heat a portion of the
first layer (5) adjacent to a portion of the second layer

coupling of the magnetization of said portion of the

second layer (6) to said portion of the first layer (5).
