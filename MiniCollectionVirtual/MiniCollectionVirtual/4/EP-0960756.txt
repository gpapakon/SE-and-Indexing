<ABSTRACT>
The air conditioning circuit has a first branch (1) containing a compressor (4) designed to receive the fluid in the gaseous state and to compress it to a super critical pressure. A second branch (20) containing a first heat exchanger (8) re-cools the fluid from the compressor to a sensibly constant pressure by transferring it to an exterior medium (F1). A first regulator (10) lowers the pressure of the fluid leaving the first heat exchanger and an evaporator (11) passes the gaseous fluid to its liquid state at a sensibly constant pressure by taking heat from a second exterior medium (F2) for vehicle interior cooling. The circuit has a third branch (3), in parallel with the second (2), containing a second regulator (25) and a second heat exchanger (26) designed to transfer the heat from the refrigerated fluid to the second exterior medium (F2) for space heating. A valve (22), according to choice, circulates the fluid into a cooling loop (1,2) formed by the first and second branches or into a heating loop (1,3) formed by the first and third branches.
