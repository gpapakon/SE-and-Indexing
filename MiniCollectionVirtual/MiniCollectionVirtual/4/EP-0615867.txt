<ABSTRACT>
A bead ring arrangement is described for vehicle 
tyres in which the wire layers (5,6,7) of the wire 

bundle are wound from a single wire (4) and the wire 
layer (7) at the core apex side has fewer turns than 

the wire layer (6) lying beneath it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bead ring assembly for 
vehicle tyres of a ring-like rubberised wire bundle 
of several wire layers arranged above one another 
and a bead apex comprising an elastomeric material, 
arranged adjoining the wire bundle and extending in 
the direction of the side wall of the tyre. Bead ring assemblies of the kind are generally known 
for example from FR-A-2374173 corresponding to the 
preamble of claim 1. In such assemblies the rings 
which are essentially non-extensible in the radial 
direction are so wound that several wires which lie 
alongside one another, and which have been combined 
by rubber material into a band-like strip, are wound 
into a ring with several wire layers above one 
another. As a rule wires are used with a relatively 
small diameter below 1mm. Despite this small 
diameter of the wires the start and end of the 
winding have an unfavourable effect with respect to 
the uniformity of the tyre, even with corresponding 
mutual displacement of the beginning and end of the 
winding.  
 Such bead rings are also known wound so that the 
ring surface defined by the radially inwardly 
disposed wire layer extends slightly conically so 
that an adaptation can be achieved to the shape of 
the associated surface of the rim seat. In this way 
a uniform contact pressure is achieved when the tyre 
is installed on a wheel rim. For bead ring 
arrangements formed in this way the danger exists 
that faulty installation of the bead ring takes 
place during tyre manufacture and that the angle of 
inclination of the radially inwardly disposed wire 
layer does not extend in correspondence with the 
inclination of the associated surface of the bead 
seat but rather opposite thereto. This faulty 
installation of the bead ring is practically not 
recognisable in the finished tyre but can however 
lead to the tyre provided with the faultily 
installed bead lifting in certain driving situations 
from the surface of the rim seat. A sudden pressure 
loss in the tyre can thereby occur causing critical 
driving situations. The object of the invention is to design a bead ring 
arrangement of the initially named kind in such a 
way that the effects resulting from the bead ring 
layout on the tyre uniformity can be at least  
 
substantially reduced, in particular with a 
simultaneous reduction of the manufacturing costs, 
and in such way that the danger of faulty 
installation of bead rings into the respective tyre 
is practically precluded by the bead ring layout. This object is satisfied in

<CLAIMS>
A bead ring assembly for vehicle tyres 
comprising a ring-shaped rubberised wire bundle (1) 

consisting of several wire layers arranged on top of 
one another, and a bead apex (2) comprising 

elastomeric material, arrange adjacent the wire bundle 
(1) and extending in the direction of the side wall 

of the tyre (3), the wire bundle (1) being wound 
from a single wire (4) and the number of wire turns 

lying alongside each other is different in at least 
two of the wire layers (5,6,7) which lie on top of 

one another, the number of 
wire turns lying alongside each other in the wire 

layer (7) at the bead apex side being smaller by at 
least two turns than the number in the wire layer 

(6) lying directly underneath it; characterised in that the mutually 
oppositely disposed surfaces of the wire bundle (1) 

and the bead apex (2) are of complementary shapes 
such that the bead apex (2) lies on the wires of 

both wire layers (6,7) in a form matched manner. 
A bead ring assembly according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the number of wire turns is 

smaller by two turns than the number in the wire 
layer (6) directly underneath it.  

 
A bead ring assembly in accordance with claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the diameter of the 

single wire (4) is larger than 1mm. 
A bead ring assembly according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the diameter of the single 

wire is in the range of 1 to 1.5mm. 
A bead ring arrangement in accordance with any 
or claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the wire 

bundle (1) is constructed with a substantially 
hexagonal cross-section. 
A bead ring assembly in accordance with any one 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

wire layer (7) at the side of the bead apex has one 
wire turn and in that the bead apex (2) extends 

beyond said wire turn on one side and also is 
supported by the underlying wire layer (6). 
A bead ring assembly in accordance with any one 
of claims 2 to 6, characterised in that the two wire 

turns of the wire bundle (1) at the bead apex side, 
lie on the side disposed towards the inner wall of 

the tyre; and in that the bead apex (2) engages over 
the two wire turns at one side. 
A bead ring assembly in accordance with any one 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that a 

single wire turn is used for the wire layer (7) on 
the bead apex side and the bead apex (2) overlaps  

 
this wire layer on one side and contacts the 

underlying wire layer (6). 
A bead ring assembly according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the bead apex (1) overlaps 

both sides of the wire layer (7). 
A bead ring assembly in accordance with one of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that the ring 

are (8) defined by the radially inwardly disposed 
wire layer (5) tapers down conically in the 

direction of the inner side of the tyre. 
A bead ring arrangement in accordance with 
claim 10, characterised in that the angle of 

inclination of the ring surface (8) is approximately 
5Â° relative to the associated tyre axis.
