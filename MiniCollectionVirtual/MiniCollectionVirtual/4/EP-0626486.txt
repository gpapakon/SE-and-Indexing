<ABSTRACT>
A roof-mounted light-transmitting frame (B) comprises: a pair of left and right 
longitudinal sash members (160); a light-transmitting sheet support sash member (420) 

mounted along an inner surface of each longitudinal sash member (160); a lower 
horizontal sash member (150) mounted between front ends of said light-transmitting 

sheet support sash members (420); an upper horizontal sash member (170) mounted 
between rear ends of said light-transmitting sheet support sash members (420); and a 

light-transmitting sheet (180) mounted inside a space defined by said light-transmitting 
sheet support sash members (420), said upper horizontal sash member (170) and said 

lower horizontal sash member (150). The light-transmitting support sash member 
(420) is mounted obliquely to said longitudinal sash member (160) such that a distance 

between its front end and a lower edge of said longitudinal sash member (160) is made 
larger than a distance between its rear end and a lower edge of said longitudinal sash 

member (160). A recess (434) is longitudinally formed on the front end of a lower 
portion of said lower horizontal sash member (150) to be fitted to said upper 

horizontal sash member (170).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a roof structure for 
collecting solar energy. There are two types of roof-mounted known structure 
for collecting solar energy, one, in which a heating 
medium sealed in a transparent sheet is heated by means 
of solar energy to make use of the resultant heat; and 
another, in which a solar energy collection member made 
of amorphous silicon or crystalline silicon is mounted 
on the back side of a light-transmitting sheet. However, when the entire surface of a roof is 
covered with solar energy collection members, the cost 
goes up and a large number of solar energy collection 
members of different dimensions are required to use in 
combination with each other to correspond to the size of 
the roof surface. Also, the roof increases in weight, 
so that rafters and sheathing boards have to bear 
substantial weight. Since each of these conventional 
structures is complicated in structure and includes a 
large number of members, the erection of such 
conventional roof-mounted structures is troublesome, 
and, the correction of dimensional errors is 
troublesome, so that it has been impossible to provide a 
roof with sufficient surface for use in collecting solar 
energy. JP-A-56085648 and GB 2000860 each disclose a structure 
which suffers from these problems.  The objects of the present invention are to provide 
a solar energy collecting structure, which can 
accommodate errors in dimension between a roof and the 
solar energy collecting roof member due to thermal 
expansion, which is simple to erect so as to be capable 
of easily providing a large-scale energy collecting 
structure, which does not need to cover the entire roof 
surface with light-transmitting frames, which is 
arranged to accommodate the dimensions of a portion of 
the roof for collecting solar energy according to a 
desired value, which permits erection of a structure 
using standard-sized light-transmitting frames, which 
reduce the weight on the roof itself and avoids 
burdening rafters or sheathing boards with excessive 
weight, and which has an excellent external appearance. In order to improve the efficiency of collection of light of a solar energy 
collecting portion of a small area entirely covered with light-transmitting sheets, the 
invention provides a roof-mounted light-transmitting frame according to Claim 1.  According to the solar energy collection structure 
of the present invention, since the usual roof members 
occupy the eaves part and the gable part, and the solar 
energy collection members

<CLAIMS>
A roof-mounted light-transmitting frame (B) comprising: 
   a pair of left and right longitudinal sash members (160); 

   a light-transmitting sheet support sash member (420) mounted along an inner surface 
of each longitudinal sash member (160); 

   a lower horizontal sash member (150) mounted between front ends of said light-transmitting 
sheet support sash members (420); 

   an upper horizontal sash member (170) mounted between rear ends of said light-transmitting 
sheet support sash members (420); and 

   a light-transmitting sheet (180) mounted inside a space defined by said light-transmitting 
sheet support sash members (420), said upper horizontal sash member (170) and 

said lower horizontal sash member (150); 
   said light-transmitting support sash member (420) being mounted obliquely to said 

longitudinal sash member (160) such that a distance between its front end and a lower edge of 
said longitudinal sash member (160) is made larger than a distance between its rear end and a 

lower edge of said longitudinal sash member (160); and 
   a recess (434) being longitudinally formed on the front end of a lower portion of said 

lower horizontal sash member (150) to be fitted to said upper horizontal sash member (170). 
A light transmitting frame (B) according to claim 1, wherein said lower horizontal sash 
member (150) has a light-transmitting sheet contact wall (431) with a height substantially 

equal to a thickness of the light-transmitting sheet (180) and longitudinally provided on an 
upper side of a front end of a belt-like light-transmitting sheet mounting piece, and a light-transmitting 

sheet press piece (436) provided at each of opposite upper ends of said light-transmitting 
sheet contact wall (431).
