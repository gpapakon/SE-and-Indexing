<ABSTRACT>
An assay to confirm the presence of antibodies to (T. cruzi) in a test sample. The assay comprises detecting the presence of antibody to three (T. cruzi) antigens, Gp90, Gp60/50 and LPPG in a test sample. The presence of antibody in the test sample to at least two of three (T. cruzi) antibodies is indicative of a confirmed reactive sample. Also provided are diagnostic reagents for detection of (T. cruzi), a process for purifying GP60/50, a process for linking a protein and LPPG, and diagnostic test kits for use when assaying for antibodies to (T. cruzi).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the detection of parenterally transmitted
diseases and their detection, and more particularly, relates to Trypanosomacruzi
which is the causative agent of Chagas' Disease, and assays for its detection in test
samples.The protozoan parasite Trypanosomacruzi is the causative agent responsible
for a disease known as Chagas' Disease or as American Trypanosomiasis. The
geographical range of this disease in the Americas is as far north as California and
Maryland and as far south as regions in Argentina and Chile. It has been estimated
that 90 million people are at risk, and that an additional 12 to 63 million individuals are
infected with this parasite. See, for example, G. A. Schmunis, Transfusion 31:547-557
(1991); Anonymous, WHO Technical Report Series 1991 811:1-93 (1991); and
S. Kingman, New Scientist 132:16-17 (1991). The first indigenous case of Chagas'
Disease in North America was reported in 1955. N. C. Woody et al., JAMA 159:676-677
(1955); R. J. Schiffler et al., JAMA 251:2983-84 (1984); J. D. Pearlman, Am.J.
Med. 75:10571060 (1983); T. R. Navin, Am.J.PublicHealth 75:366-369 (1985);
and Anonymous, TexasHealthBull. 159:111-13 (1955).Chagas' Disease is transmissible through blood products; the transmission of
Chagas' Disease through blood transfusion in the United States has been recognized
for some time. Two recent serological surveys in the Washington, D. C. area have
indicated that several individuals residing in that area, originally from El Salvador and
Nicaragua, had sera reactive for Chagas' Disease. L. V. Kirchhoff et al., JAMA
254:3058-3060 (1985); and L. V. Kirchhoff et al., Am.J.Med. 82:915-920 (1987).
It has been estimated from this survey that there are up to 100,000 individuals living in
the United States who are chronically infected with T.cruzi. A. Skolnick, JAMA
265:173 (1991). In a separate report, of 1027 consecutive blood donations in Los
Angeles County during a three-month period which were screened by a complement
fixation test for Chagas' Disease, there were ten initial reactives and one confirmed
case. P. Kerndt et al., Transfusion 28:31S Abstract s108 (1988) and P. Kerndt et al.,
Transfusion 31:814-818 (1991). Imported Chagas' Disease has been recognized in
Europe as well, with a documented case of congenital T.cruzi infection reported in
Sweden. P. O. Pehrson et al., Scand.J.Infect. Dis. 13:307-308 (1981). Trypanosomacruzi has one of the most complex life cycles of trypanosomes
found in man. Trypomastigotes circulate in the blood of
