cranked shaft portions (11a, 11b and 11c) having respective eccentric 
axes (CA
11a
, CA

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motion transforming 
mechanism for transforming a rotational motion to a curvilinear 
motion. The motion transforming mechanism of the kind for 
transforming the rotation motion to the straight motion is utilized 
widely in the mechanical fields as a fundamental mechanical structure 
and for example is represented by a so-called rack-and-pinion 
structure consisting of a rack and a pinion held in mesh with each 
other. The rack-and-pinion structure is so constructed that the 
rotational motion of the pinion is transformed to the straight motion 
of the rack by way of a small number, for instance, "1" or "2" of 
teeth of the rack and the pinion meshing with one another. As a 
consequence, the rack and the pinion are inevitably required to 
become large in width in order to obtain a large thrust force for 
moving the rack with respect to the pinion. This results in such a 
drawback that the rack-and-pinion structure cannot avoid to become 
large in size. In view of the foregoing drawback, there has so far 
been proposed by the present applicant a prior-art motion transforming 
mechanism disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication 
No. 4-160258 corresponding to EP-A482827 and comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1 and 15 respectively as shown in Figs. 11 and 12. Fig. 11 is a fragmentary 
schematic view showing an outline construction of the prior-art 
motion transforming mechanism and Fig. 12 is drawn for explaining 
the motion of the motion transforming mechanism. In Figs. 11 
and 12, the motion transforming mechanism comprises a first rotation 
shaft 1 driven by an electric motor not shown, three rotation plates  
 
2 to 4 each formed with a plurality of teeth 2a-2b, 3a-3b and 4a-4b 
and rotatably supported by the first rotation shaft 1, a straight rail 
6 formed with a plurality of teeth 6a held in mesh with the teeth 2a-2b, 
3a-3b and 4a-4b of the rotation plates 2 to 4 and a second rotation 
shaft 8 rotatably supporting the rotation plates 2 to 4 in cooperation 
with the first rotation shaft 1. As will be better seen from 
Fig. 12, the teeth 2a-2b, 3a-3b and 4a-4b of the rotation plates 2 to 
4 are in the form of semicircular shape, while the teeth 6a of the 
straight rail 6 are in the form of wave shape. The first rotation shaft 1 is formed with three cranked 
shaft portions 1a to 1c having respective eccentric axes displaced 
from and arranged equi-angularly around the center axis of the first 
rotation shaft 1 so that the cranked shaft portions
