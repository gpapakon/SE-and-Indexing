<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a pipe, particularly for a motor vehicle. This pipe (1) comprises an overmoulding (2) for fastening the pipe (1) onto a support of the vehicle, and is characterised in that it includes a split ring (4) clamped around the pipe (1) and around which the abovementioned overmoulding (2) is performed. The overmoulding (2) includes a metal armature forming a fastening lug (3). This invention applies in particular to the flexible pipes in a motor vehicle.

Pipe (1) in particular for an automotive vehicle of 
the kind comprising a mantle casting (2) for the 

fastening of the pipe onto a support in particular of a 
vehicle, characterized in that it comprises a split ring 

(4) clamped about the external portion of the pipe (1) 
and onto which the mantle casting molding (2) is made. 
Pipe according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
mantle casting (2) comprises a strap forming a fastening 

lug (3). 
Pipe according to claim 2, characterized in that this 
strap is metallic. 
Pipe according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the mantle casting (2) is made in a 

mold (6) bearing upon both ends of the ring (4) in order 
to avoid that the mantle casting material (12) runs over 

onto the pipe (1). 
Pipe according to any one of the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that the mantle casting (2) is made from 

a material comprised in the group comprising a 
thermoplastic material, a thermosetting material, a 

vulcanizable elastomer made adhesive and a vulcanizable 
elastomer not made adhesive. 
Pipe according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the split ring (4) is made from a 

material comprised in the group comprising a plastics 
material, a metallic material, a cross-linked elastomer 

and a thermosetting elastomer.  
 
Pipe according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the split ring (4) is self-clamping 

and comprises a limiting stop. 
Pipe according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the split ring (4) is perforated 

(4a) and comprises an inner circular groove. 
Pipe according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the split ring (4) comprises at 

least one outer circular groove (4d). 
Pipe according to any one of claims 2 to 9, 
characterized in that since the mantle casting (2) does 

not adhere to the ring (4), this mantle casting (2) may 
turn about the ring (4) under the action of a force so as 

to permit the orientation of the fastening lug (3). 
Pipe according to any one of claims 2 to 9, 
characterized in that the mantle casting (2) is made from 

a vulcanizable elastomer adhered to the ring (4) and may 
turn together with the ring (4) about the duct (1) under 

the action of a force exerted upon this ring (4) so as to 
orient the fastening lug (3). 
Pipe (7) according to any one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that it is made fast to other 

pipes (8) by a same mantle casting (11) provided on 
several corresponding split rings (9, 10) or one split 

ring of complex shape surrounding the different pipes 
with the metallic lug (3) being either incorporated or 

not incorporated into the mantle casting (2). 
Pipe according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the split ring comprises a thinned  

 
portion (A) forming a hinge on the side opposite to the 

slit (5a).
