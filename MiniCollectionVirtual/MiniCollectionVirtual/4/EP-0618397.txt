<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for machining the inner surface of a pipeline which is not accessible by foot contains a vehicle which can travel in the pipeline and, on a retaining device (10) which is mounted in the vehicle such that it can rotate about an axis of rotation, there is a machining apparatus which is mounted on a radial carriage (106). The radial carriage (106) is guided displaceably on a piston rod (104), mounted in each case at its ends in the retaining device (10) such that it is at rest transversely with respect to the axis of rotation, and is designed as a chamber through which the piston rod (104) is guided and which is divided up, by a piston (108), into sub-chambers (106a, 106b) which can be subjected to a pressure medium. This measure ensures reliable guidance and securing of the machining apparatus, with the result that bending moments and longitudinal forces acting on the machining apparatus are reliably absorbed and channelled further onto the vehicle.
