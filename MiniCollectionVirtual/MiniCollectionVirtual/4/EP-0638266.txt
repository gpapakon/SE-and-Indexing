<ABSTRACT>
An improved dual leg rest assembly (20) is adapted for use 
in single and multi-person articles of furniture (i.e. 

chairs, sectionals, sofas, loveseats, etc.). The mechanism 
causes coordinated articulating movement of a primary leg (26) 

rest panel and a secondary leg rest panel (28) (i.e. mid-ottoman). 
The assembly comprises a primary leg rest panel (26); 

a primary linkage assembly (30) interconnecting said primary leg 
rest panel (26) and the mechanism for articulated movement of 

said primary leg rest panel (26) from a stowed position to an 
extended position; the secondary leg rest panel (28); and a 

secondary linkage assembly (32) interconnecting said secondary 
leg rest panel (28) and said primary linkage (30) assembly for 

articulated movement of said secondary leg rest panel (28) in 
coordination with said primary leg rest panel (26) from the 

stowed position to the extended position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to articles of furniture of the type
having an extensible leg rest assembly and, in particular, to a dual leg rest assembly
having a primary leg rest panel and a secondary leg rest panel interconnected by a
linkage mechanism for concurrent articulated movement between stowed and
extended positions.Traditionally, reclining-type articles of furniture (i.e., chairs, sofas,
loveseats, sectionals, etc.) are equipped with an actuation mechanism for operatively
interconnecting a seat assembly to a stationary frame structure for reclining movement
between an "upright" position and various "reclined" positions. As an additional
comfort feature, the actuation mechanism may also be adapted to move an extensible
leg rest assembly between a retracted (i.e., "stowed") position and a protracted (i.e.,
"extended") position. The actuation mechanism typically includes a combination of
various mechanical linkages that can be selectively actuated for causing either
coordinated or independent reclining movement of the seat assembly relative to
extensible movement of the leg rest assembly.As is known, most conventional leg rest assemblies include an
upholstered leg rest panel and a pair of scissor-type linkages interconnecting the leg
rest panel to the actuation mechanism for movement between the stowed and
extended positions. In the extended position, a gap is created between a front edge
of the seat and a rear edge of the leg rest panel such that only the seat occupant's
feet and lower legs are supported on the leg rest panel. In an effort to provide 
additional leg support, it has been proposed to incorporate a second leg rest panel
(i.e., a mid-ottoman) into the leg rest assembly between the seat and the primary leg
rest panel to provide a substantially uninterrupted leg support surface. In essence,
such a "dual" leg rest assembly is operable for converting the reclining chair into a
chaise lounge chair. Various examples of reclining chairs equipped with a dual leg
rest assembly are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,774,412 (Luckhardt); 2,871,917
(Schliephacke); 2,914,114 (Fletcher); 3,537,747 (Rodgers); 4,674,794 (Pine); and
5,090,768 (Re). However, most conventional dual leg rest assemblies have a linkage
mechanism that is relatively complex, bulky, and expensive to manufacture.
Commonly, this complexity is due to the need to provide and maintain adequate
clearance between the two leg panels during the concurrent articulated movement
therebetween. In addition, some conventional

<CLAIMS>
A leg rest assembly (20) for an article of
furniture (10) having a seat assembly (16, 18) supported

from a chair frame (12) and an actuation means (22, 23) for
enabling said leg rest assembly to move between a stowed

position and an extended position, said leg rest assembly
comprising:


a primary leg rest panel (26);
a secondary leg rest panel (28); and
linkage means (24) interconnecting said primary and
secondary leg rest panels (26, 28) to said actuation means

(22, 23) for coordinated articulated movement such that in
said stowed position said secondary leg rest panel (28) is

oriented behind and in general parallelism with said
primary leg rest panel (26) so as to be concealed thereby,

and in said extended position said primary and secondary

leg rest panels lie in substantially the same plane so as
to provide a substantial continuous and uninterrupted

support surface with said seat assembly (16), said linkage
means (24) including a primary linkage (30) for causing

articulated movement of said primary leg rest panel (26)
and a secondary linkage (32) for causing articulated

movement of said secondary leg rest panel (28), and wherein
said secondary linkage (32) is supported on said primary

linkage (30) for movement in response to movement of said
primary linkage;
said primary linkage (30) comprising first and second 
board links (42,44) pivotally connected to said primary leg

rest panel (26), a first connector link (60) pivotally
interconnecting said first board link (42) to said chair

frame (12), a second connector link (48) pivotally
interconnecting said second board link (44) to one end of a

support link (56), and a drive link (70) interconnecting
said actuation means (22, 23) to the opposite end of said

support link (56), said first connector link (60) being
pivotably interconnected to an intermediate portion of said

support link (56) and said second connector link (48) being
pivotally interconnected to an intermediate portion of said

first board link (42); and
said secondary linkage (32) comprising a third board
link (82) having a first portion (84) on which said

secondary leg rest panel (28) is secured, a second portion
(92) pivotally interconnected to said first board link (42)

and a third portion pivotally interconnected to said second
board link (44) via a third connector link (90).
A leg rest assembly as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said third board link (82) pivots about said

pivotal interconnection between its second portion (92) and
said first board link (42) in response to pivotal movement

of said third connector link (90).
A leg rest assembly as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2, wherein said first portion (84) of said third

board link (82) has an angled bracket flange (84) to which
said secondary leg rest panel (28) is secured, said second 

portion (92) is an offset intermediate segment of said
third board link and said third portion is a distal end

segment thereof.
A leg rest assembly as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, wherein said primary and secondary

leg rest panels (26,28) are upholstered members having the
same thickness.
An article of furniture comprising:

a leg rest assembly (20) as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims;
a seat assembly supported from a chair frame; and
an actuation means for enabling the leg rest assembly
to move between its stowed position and its extended
