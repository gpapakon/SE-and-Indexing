<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a package according
to the preamble of claim 1 and an opening method therefor for an
exchangeable container cartridge for containing ink to be
supplied to a recording head according to the claims 13 or 14.
Types of container cartridge detachably mountable relative
to an ink jet recording apparatus are classified into
two groups. In one of them, it is connected with a
recording head fixedly mounted on a recording
apparatus, through a flexible tube, and it is
detachably mountable to the recording apparatus. In
this type, a flexible generally flat bladder is
accommodated in a casing of plastic material, and the
bladder is provided with a jointing portion of an
elastic material for supplying the ink out. The ink
is contained in the sealed bladder. Such an ink container
cartridge can be put on market or transported without
paying particular attention to the structure of a
package therefor.In a second type, an ink container cartridge is
integrally constituted by a recording head and an ink
container, and the integral ink cartridge is
detachably mountable to an apparatus as a unit. This
type is used, since downsizing is possible. An ink container cartridge, generally, is provided with
an ink absorbing material, and is provided with an air
vent for fluid communication between the inside of the
ink container and the outside thereof to permit supply
of the ink therein. The recording head is provided
with an ink ejection outlet or outlets, and therefore,
the possibility that the ink leaks out through the ink
ejection outlet or the air vent, is not avoidable.In order to prevent the ink leakage during
the transportation of the ink container cartridge, both of the
ink ejection outlet and the air vent or only the ink
ejection outlet when the air vent has a structure for
preventing the ink leakage, is sealed by an elastic
material or an adhesive sealing tape. It is contained
in a rigid casing, and an opening of the casing is
covered with a covering member having a property of
preventing water introduction. Then, it is packaged
and put on the market. When the sealing tape is used,
the portion of the sealing tape sealing the air vent
is first opened, and only then, the sealing tape
portion for the ink ejection outlet is removed
preferably, to assure the safe removal of the sealing
tape in case that the internal pressure of the ink
container is increased due to ambient condition change
(pressure change or temperature change) or due to the
transportation thereof.Recently, for the purpose of
