<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxygen absorbing
member having an oxygen absorbing property and formed into a
sheet like shape, and a method for manufacture thereof. The
oxygen absorbing member can be used in the field of a
container storing foodstuffs or pharmaceuticals. Oxygen
existing in the container can be removed by securing this
oxygen absorbing member in the container, and thus
deterioration or oxidization of foodstuffs or pharmaceuticals
can be prevented.In order to maintain quality or freshness of foodstuffs
or pharmaceuticals during their storage period, so-called
oxygen absorbing packaging, wherein an oxygen absorbing agent
is enclosed in the container together with articles to be
stored, has been widely used for the purpose of absorbing
oxygen existing in a package. This oxygen absorbing packaging
may prevent articles from deteriorating due to an influence of
oxygen or eroding due to microbes under the existence of
oxygen.. Therefore, various packages of articles delivered to
general consumers generally contain oxygen absorbing agent.The oxygen absorbing packaging can be attained by
enclosing foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals or the like to be stored
in a container having a property of blocking permeation of a
gas together with oxygen absorbing member in which oxygen
absorbing agent is contained. Generally, this oxygen
absorbing member is supplied in a form of a small bag of gas
permeable packaging member containing oxygen absorbing
composition in granular or powder shape.In many cases, it is desired that such a small bag of
oxygen absorbing agent (sometimes simply referred to as a
"small bag") is secured to inside a container. Thereby, an
oxygen absorbing agent is prevented from being mixed in and
eaten with articles (foodstuff), or being accidentally cooked
with articles.Various methods of securing this small bag are proposed.
Generally, small bags are attached to an inner wall surface of
packaging members, such as packaging bags or containers
(carton, box, etc.) by use of adhesive agent, hot melt agent
or pressure sensitive adhesive double coated tapes.However, it is also difficult, in many cases, to
sufficiently secure the small bag to a container by such
reasons as surface of the small bag is often uneven and a 
small bag is swollen. If a small bag is secured to a
container by any chance, it is often secured to a container in
part, but not entire surface of a small bag.As a result, an area of a small bag not in contact with
the surface of a container creates a gap. Such a gap causes
vario
