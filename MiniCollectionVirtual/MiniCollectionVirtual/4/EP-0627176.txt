<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a bulk stream (38) of 
equioriented filter-tipped cigarettes (2), whereby the 

cigarettes (2) in each of two orderly successions (9, 
10) of equioriented single cigarettes (2) are collected 

together to form a first (27) and second (28) orderly 
bulk stream of equioriented cigarettes; and the two 

streams (27, 28) are fed one into the other to form a 
single orderly bulk stream (38) of equioriented 

cigarettes (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
forming a bulk stream of equioriented cigarettes. The method according to the present invention is 
advantageously employed for bulk feeding a continuous 
stream of equioriented cigarettes to a one-input packing 
machine. As described, for example, in British Patent 
n. 2,241,866, filter-tipped cigarettes are formed on a 
filter assembly machine, along a first portion of which 
each portion in a first succession of cigarette portions 
with a given spacing is joined, at a rolling station and 
by means of a strip connecting element, to a 
corresponding portion in a second succession of 
cigarette portions, to form a tobacco item hereinafter 
referred to as a "double cigarette". Each double 
cigarette consists of two cigarette portions separated 
by a double filter connected integral with the two 
cigarette portions by said connecting element. Again according to the above British patent, once  
 
formed, the double cigarettes are fed successively 
through a cutting station where they are cut 
transversely in half to form two successions of 
oppositely-oriented single cigarettes, i.e. arranged 
with the respective filters facing and substantially 
contacting each other. The two successions of 
filter-tipped cigarettes are then fed to a turnover 
station where each cigarette in one succession is turned 
over and fed into the space between two adjacent 
cigarettes in the other succession, to form a single 
succession of equioriented cigarettes. The succession of equioriented cigarettes so 
formed is then fed through a quality control station 
where a single test unit successively tests the 
permeability and/or integrity and/or ventilation of the 
cigarettes and, if necessary, provides for rejecting 
them at a reject station. At this point, the cigarettes are fed one on top 
of the other onto a conveyor to form a mass of 
equioriented cigarettes which is fed continuously to the 
input of a packing machine. Recent improvements to filter assembly machines 
(see, for example, Italian Patent Application n. 
BO92A000311) now enable two successions of spaced 
equioriented cigarettes to be formed directly from the 
cut double cigarettes, for better performing the above 
tests, and which provide for obtaining two separate 
equioriented streams of single cigarettes at the output  
 
of the filter assembly machine. The two streams so 
formed may advantageously be supplied to the respective 
inputs of two separate packing machines, or to the two 
inputs of a two-line packing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a bulk stream (38) of 
equioriented cigarettes (2) from two streams (9, 10) of 

single cigarettes (2), the cigarettes (2) in each stream 
(9, 10) being equioriented in relation to the cigarettes 

(2) in the other stream (10, 9), and the method being 
characterized in that it comprises stages consisting in 

collecting together the cigarettes (2) in each said 
stream (9, 10) of single cigarettes, to form two bulk 

streams (27, 28) of equioriented cigarettes; and feeding 
the two bulk streams (27, 28) one into the other to form 

a single overall bulk stream (38) of equioriented 
cigarettes (2). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
in that the two bulk streams (27, 28) of cigarettes are 

fed one into the other by feeding one (27) of the two 
said bulk streams (27, 28) of cigarettes on top of the 

other (28). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said bulk streams (27, 28) of 

equioriented cigarettes are fed inside respective at 
least partially superimposed channels (31, 32) 

presenting respective superimposed outputs (35, 36). 
A method as claimed in Claim 3, characterized 
in that said overall stream (38) of equioriented 

cigarettes is formed in a respective channel (37), the 
input of which communicates with the outputs (35, 36) of 

 
the feed channels (31, 32) of said two bulk streams (27, 

28) of equioriented cigarettes.
