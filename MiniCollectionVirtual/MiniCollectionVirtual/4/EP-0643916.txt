<DESCRIPTION>
Conventionally, choux-mixes were prepared by heating a 
mixture of water, flour and fat. Then, eggs were added 
during the batter preparation. This process, however, is 
labour-intensive, because of the careful way the heating 
must performed, while the quality of the products obtained 
is not always satisfactory. An improvement was obtained by 
the introduction of powdered choux-mixes. These mixes could 
be free of eggs, however, they could also be made with eggs 
present. A disadvantage from these choux-mixes, however, 
is that they only could be baked in ovens provided with a 
steam regulating device. Moreover, often clumps were 
formed, when whole egg was added to the mix.
 
From JP 54/23167 choux-mixes are known that comprise starch 
and a dry, powdered mixture of fat and gluten or fat and 
sodium caseinate, the fat applied is spray-dried. The 
product obtained with such a mixture is completely hollow. 
We aim for products from which the internal texture is like 
a porous spiderweb without many big cavities. Further, we 
aim for choux-mixes that are completely mixable with both 
cold and hot water without clump-formation, while moulded 
batters, made from the mixes, must be suitable for baking 
in all types of ovens, including ovens without steam 
regulation. Our mixes should further have a good shelf-life, 
while the addition of chemical leavening agents 
should not affect the product performance negatively. We 
found that above aims could be fulfilled by applying fat in 
two different forms in our mixes, i.e. 1) as a homogeneous 
powder mixture together with a pre-gelatinized starch, 
wherein the mixture is made by spray-drying and 2) as a 
spray-crystallized powdered fat. Therefore, our invention concerns in the first place a 
choux-mix comprising 
A: 20-60 wt% of a free flowing, homogeneous powder 
mixture of at least:  (1) pre-gelatinized starch, preferably pre-gelatinized 
wheat flour, and (2) a fat,  
wherein the weight ratio of (1) : (2) ranges from 
1:1 to 3:1, while the fat is a spray-dried fat; B: 5-15 wt% of a free flowing, spray-crystallized 
powdered fat, containing an emulsifier system, 
preferably in such quantities that the total mix 
contains 0.1-3 wt% emulsifier; C: 2-15 wt% of a protein D: 30-50 wt% of a pre-gelatinized starch, 
while the weight ratio of the fat components (A) and 
(B) ranges from (1:2) to (2:1). The pre-gelatinized starch component (1) of component (A) 
can be derived from any gelatinizable starch. We, however, 
prefer to use a wheat-starch in the form of wheat
