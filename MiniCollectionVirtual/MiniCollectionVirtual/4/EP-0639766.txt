<ABSTRACT>
X-ray Fluorescence Inspection Apparatus comprises an 
X-ray tube (1) for generating X-rays having a range of 

energies which are directed towards a sample position. A 
first filter assembly (3) is mounted between the X-ray tube 

(1) and the sample position and is movable between at least 
two positions to enable the energy band of X-rays reaching 

the sample position to be controlled in two different ways. 
An X-ray monitor (8) monitors X-rays from the sample 

position; and a second filter assembly (6) mounted between 
the sample position and the monitor (8) is movable between 

at least two positions to enable the energy band of X-rays 
reaching the monitor to be controlled in two different 

ways.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to X-ray Fluorescence Inspection 
Apparatus for use, for example, in determining the content 
of specified elements within samples. Oxford Instruments, Analytical Systems Division has 
manufactured for a number of years an X-ray Fluorescence 
Inspection Apparatus known as the LAB-X. In this 
apparatus, the sample is placed onto a turntable which 
moves the sample to an inspection position. A source of X-rays 
such as Fe55 is located adjacent to the sample 
position and generates X-rays which cause elements within 
the sample to fluoresce and generate X-rays with energies 
which are characteristic of the elements. These X-rays are 
monitored using a proportional counter or the like to 
determine the intensity of the X-rays at each energy and so 
determine the concentration of the elements in the sample. Radioisotope sources are becoming much less acceptable 
environmentally and are subject to stringent conditions 
which vary from country to country. They are also 
uncontrollable and decay with time. As a result, there is 
a need to replace the radioisotope sources with equivalent 
X-ray tubes which generate X-rays in response to the 
excitation by electrons of a suitable target and can thus 
be used as a source of controlled energy and intensity 
which may be switched on or off at will. One of the 
problems with making this substitution is that X-ray tubes 
generate a much broader energy bandwidth of X-rays in 
comparison with radioisotopes. In accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention, X-ray Fluorescence Inspection Apparatus 
comprises an X-ray tube for generating X-rays having a 
range of energies which are directed towards a sample 
position; a first filter assembly mounted between the X-ray 
tube and the sample position and movable between at least 
two positions to enable the energy band of X-rays reaching 
the sample position to be controlled in two different ways; 
an X-ray monitor for monitoring X-rays from the sample  
 
position; and a second filter assembly mounted between the 
sample position and the monitor and movable between at 
least two positions to enable the energy band of X-rays 
reaching the monitor to be controlled in two different 
ways. We have developed a new X-ray Fluorescence Inspection 
Apparatus which enables X-ray tubes to be used but which 
generates results which are as good and usually even better 
than have been obtained using radioisotopes. This is 
achieved by providing a range of filters between the X-ray 
tube and the sample position
