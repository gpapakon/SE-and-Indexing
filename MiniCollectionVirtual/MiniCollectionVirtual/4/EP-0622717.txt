<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic temperature stable
circuit which is useful for current recycling while inductive
loads are being driven, and particularly to such a circuit
which is integrated monolithically.Within the scope of this invention, the problems connected
with inductive loads as used in motor vehicle fuel injection
control devices will be considered by way of example.In such devices, the driving of the current flow through an
inductive load representing the injector allows to open and
close the device.In such a case, as the inductive load is being driven, it
matters that the control current flowing through the load can
be cut off within the shortest possible time, in order for
the injector closing time to be made short and the amount of
fuel injected accurately metered out.It is recognized that, in general, the driving of inductive
loads brings about some problems during the transients.In fact, upon cutting off the current flowing through an
inductor, a voltage surge (positive or negative overvoltage)
occurs at the inductor.That overvoltage is due to the induced electromotive force
tending to clamp the current to the value attained during the
"on" period, i.e. during the charging phase.In the instance of fuel injection control in a motor car, as
herein considered, the load has a terminal at a fixed supply
potential, so that the potential increase will occur at the
linking node to the driver circuit.Accordingly, the amplitude of the voltage peaks at said node 
must be limited, since otherwise they may cause breakage of
the junctions in the semiconductor elements provided within
the driver or other circuits connected to that same inductive
load.In addition, with monolithically integrated circuits, such
peaks may be a triggering cause of parasitic transistors.A state-of-art approach provides for the introduction,
between the driver circuit and the inductive load, of
circuitry including power elements for the so-called
recycling of discharge current from the load.In that way, the energy stored within the inductive load can
be dissipated: the voltage thereat, after attaining a
predetermined maximum, will remain constant for a time and
then drop back to zero along with the current, following full
discharge through the power elements themselves.The discharge time is dependent on the maximum voltage value
attained at the inductor.In such prior approaches, therefore, the recycle circuit is
also to limit the voltage rise to a predetermined top value.
This voltage limiting effect is referred to
