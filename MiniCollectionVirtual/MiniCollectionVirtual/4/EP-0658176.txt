<ABSTRACT>
An elastic composite is provided having natural rubber and epoxidized natural rubber components. Compared to known composites, the present composition achieves reduced oil swell and absorption, lower permanent set, lower modulus of elasticity, and high tear strength. When formed in a tape, the composition is extremely useful for legbands, straps and contours of swimwear and other garments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to elastomeric compositions consisting 
essentially of a component of epoxidized natural rubber 
ENR, a component of natural rubber and a component of a non-reinforcing 
filler admixed with conventional additives. The various situations requiring elastic materials have led to 
the development of a wide range of natural and synthetic rubbers. 
Many of the more demanding situations have required blends 
of these rubbers to provide the proper mix of characteristics. 
For example, vehicle tires often include styrene-butadiene rubber 
(SBR), which is the most common synthetic elastomer, polybutadiene 
(BR), and even natural rubber. The characteristics usually 
associated with natural rubber, i.e., abrasion resistance, 
resilience, good high- and low-temperature performance, and tear 
strength are ideal for tires and similar applications, which 
experience great punishment. However, other environments have less demanding strength requirements, 
but make other strict demands on elastomers. For example, 
in the clothing industry, elastomers used for form fitting 
clothing have a unique set of requirements. These include 
a low stretch modulus, high dimensional stability (to retain the 
article's shape), low permanent set (to avoid losing the snug 
fit of a garment), and tear resistance (to avoid tearing while 
being punctured by the sewing needle). These demands are compounded, 
for example, when the garment is swimwear. In this 
area, in addition to the clothing fit requirements, the garment 
may be exposed to large amounts of sunlight, chlorine from pool  
 
water, salt-water, and oils from body perspiration and sun protection 
lotions. In US-A-4 341 672 a curable rubbery tread composition is disclosed 
consisting of rubber, filler, extender oil and a sulfur or 
peroxy curing system. The filler may be calcium carbonate, ion 
oxide, silica, calcium silica or alumina. These compositions may 
have improved skid resistance but will not meet the demand for 
good elastication and other requirements of the clothing industry 
mentioned above. A common choice of elastomer for clothing elastication purposes 
is natural rubber (cis-1,4 polyisoprene). It provides excellent 
elongation properties, can be made soft, has very good tear 
resistance and is strong. However, it is severely deficient in 
resistance to sunlight, oils, or chlorine. A common synthetic 
substitute for natural rubber in clothing is Neoprene tape, 
which has excellent resistance to oil, ozone, abrasion and solvents.
