<ABSTRACT>
A dual polarised flat plate antenna wherein a deliberate unbalance 
of phase and/or amplitude is introduced into the feed arrangement 

for one of the polarisations such that interactive coupling between 
colocated elements associated with the respective polarisations 

causes the beamwidth and/or shape of the radiation pattern for the 
other polarisation to be controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polarisation diversity antenna
constructed as a flat plate antenna.A well known form of flat plate antenna comprises a pair of closely
spaced correspondingly apertured ground planes with an
interposed printed circuit film providing probes extending into the
areas of the apertures and a feed network for the probes. This
antenna construction lends itself to a cheap yet effective
construction for an array antenna comprising either a linear array or
a planar array of aperturesA flat plate linear array antenna for a cellular telephone base station
is disclosed in our co-pending patent application 91 24291.7.The principle of diversity in antennas is also well known to combat
losses in different conditions. Space diversity consists of utilising
two spaced apart substantially identical antennas. Polarisation
diversity consists of using two antennas with respective orthogonal
polarisations to receive or transmit the same signals. Polarisation
diversity holds promise for improvements when co-located
antennas are used. This does not necessarily mean that the cross-polarised
antennas have to have co-incident phase centres; the
option is available to move the antennas closer together than
necessary for co-polarised spatial diversity. The ability to do this 
means that a compact dual diversity arrangement (spatial and
polarisation) may be effected, an option not workable with spatial
diversity alone.In the cellular base station context diversity is employed to combat
a propagation environment subject to deep multipath fading. Base
stations commonly employ sectored beam antennas for
omnidirectional coverage in azimuth. Conventionally sectored base
station antennas may comprise separate arrays for transmit and
receive. Cellular radio systems rely on antenna radiation properties
with sharp cut-off outside a beamwidth specific to the cellular
layout.The conventional dual polarised flat plate antenna comprises
substantially identical radiating elements except for their orthogonal
orientation. In the design of such antennas for cellular base
stations the factors of beamwidth and beamshaping are of
paramount importance.According to the present invention there is provided a dual
polarised flat plate antenna with each radiating element comprising
two co-located apertures characterised in that the feed
arrangement for one of the polarisations is adapted to provide an
unbalance of phase and/or amplitude such that interactive coupling

A dual polarised flat plate antenna with each radiating
element comprising two co-located apertures characterised in that

the feed arrangement (12e, Fig.2) for one of the polarisations is
adapted to provide an unbalance of phase and/or amplitude such

that interactive coupling between colocated apertures associated
with the respective polarisations causes the beamwidth and/or

shape of the radiation pattern for the other polarisation to be
controlled.
A dual polarised flat plate antenna arrangement according to
claim 1 wherein each aperture has a first pair of colinear probes

extending into the aperture, the first pair of probes having a first
orientation parallel to an axis about which the apertures are

disposed, a second pair of colinear probes extending into the
aperture, the second pair of probes having a second orientation

orthogonal to that of the first pair, and further comprising first feed
network means arranged to feed signals to the first pairs of probes

and second feed network means arranged to feed signals to the
second pairs of probes, wherein in each element the respective

probes for each orientation are fed as two pairs and each pair is fed
in a balanced antiphase manner, characterised in that for the two

pairs in at least one orientation for one polarisation the respective
feed network means (31j, 32j Fig.3) is arranged to introduce an

unbalance between the balanced pairs of probes (31d-31h, 32d-32h
Fig.3).
An antenna arrangement according to claim 2 characterised
in that the respective feed network means is arranged to introduce

a phase unbalance between the balanced pairs.
An antenna arrangement according to claim 2 characterised
in that the respective feed network means is arranged to introduce

an ammplitude unbalance between the balanced pairs.
An antenna arrangement according to claim 3 characterised
in that the phase unbalance is effected by alteration of the probe

terminations. 
An array antenna comprised of a plurality of antenna
arrangements as claimed in any preceding claim.
A method of controlling the radiation pattern of a dual
polarised array antenna having colocated radiation elements

associated with the respective polarisations, characterised in that
the method comprises introducing into a feed arrangement (31j, 32j

Fig.3) for one of the polarisations a deliberate unbalance of signal
phase and/or amplitude whereby interactive coupling between the

colocated elements results in an alteration of the radiation pattern
for the other polarisation.
