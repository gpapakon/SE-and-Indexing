<ABSTRACT>
The device consists of the presence, in each node of the network, of a cellular automatic unit, consisting of cells (0 to 8) linked together by connections in such a way that all the cells and the connections respectively represent the nodes and the links of the network, each of the cells being equipped with means for calculating the cost of a route, working asynchronously, and communicating with each of its closest neighbours and only with them. When the device is simulated in a sequential machine, the latter is programmed to choose the order in which the cells are activated, on the basis of the minimum number of links to be traversed in order to link two nodes, which are determined by making the cellular automatic unit run with link states which are all equal to each other. Applications: especially to telecommunication networks.
