A motor vehicle heating device (1) which is 
independent of the engine, with a means (24) for the 

measured feeding of fuel to a burner (8) to which 
combustion air is delivered by a blower (11) driven by an 

electric motor (10), with a means (14; 21) of varying the 
combustion air and/or fuel quantity as well as a control 

device (18) comprising a non-volatile data storage means 
(22) and a microprocessor (19), characterised in that it is 

possible via an input (26, 20) to feed to the control 
device (18) a correction value which is stored in the data 

storage means (22) and alter output signals from the 
control device (18) to the means (24) of feeding fuel 

and/or to the combustion air blower (11) to determine their 
respective rotary speed or cyclic frequency. 
A motor vehicle heating device (1) which is 
independent of the engine, according to Claim 1, 

characterised in that the correction value is input into 
the data storage means (22) via a serial interface (20). 
A motor vehicle heating device (1) which is 
independent of the engine, according to one of the 

preceding Claims, characterised in that the correction 
value can be adjusted by means of a potentiometer (21), 

detected by means of an analogue/digital converter (23) and 
input into the data storage means (22). 
A motor vehicle heating device (1) which is 
independent of the engine, according to Claim 3, 

characterised in that the analogue/digital converter (23) 
is integrated into the microprocessor (19). 
A motor vehicle heating device (1) which is 
independent of the engine, according to Claim 3 or 4,  

 
characterised in that the potentiometer (21) is disposed on 

a circuit board (15) of the control device (18). 
A motor vehicle heating device (1) which is 
independent of the engine, according to Claim 2, 

characterised in that the serial interface (20) can be used 
for read-out of operating parameters by means of a 

diagnostic unit. 
A motor vehicle heating device (1) which is 
independent of the engine, according to Claim 6, 

characterised in that the correction value is input by 
means of the diagnostic unit. 
A motor vehicle heating device (1) which is 
independent of the engine, according to one of the 

preceding Claims, which is adapted to be operated in a 
plurality of load stages, characterised in that the data 

storage means (22) stores correction values which are 
specific to each of the load stages.
