<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a powdery, melamine-coated
ammonium polyphosphate and a process for producing
the same. More particularly, it relates to a powdery,
melamine-coated ammonium polyphosphate used as a component
of flame-retardants to be added to or impregnated
in thermoplastic resins, paints, etc. or paper, etc.,
and a process for producing the same.Ammonium polyphosphate is very easily hydrolyzed
due to its chemical structure; hence when it is used
as a component of flame-retardants by adding it to or
impregnate it in thermoplastic resins, paints, etc. or
paper, etc., there are raised drawbacks that various
characteristics of the resulting product such as
electrical insulation properties, mechanical physical
properties and flame-retardancy notably lower due to
the hygroscopicity, water-solubility and hydrolytic
properties.In order to overcome these drawbacks, a number of
proposals have so far been made as regards the improvements 
in the water-solubility and hydrolytic properties of
ammonium polyphosphate. For example, Japanese patent
publication No. Sho 53-15478 discloses a process wherein
5 to 50% by weight of melamine or melamine phosphate as
a melamine component, ammonium phosphate and urea or
crystalline urea phosphate are mixed, followed by heat-condensation,
to produce a modified ammonium polyphosphate.
However, the modified ammonium polyphosphate disclosed
therein has a high solubility in water; hence its use as
a component of flame-retardants raises a problem.Japanese patent publication No. Sho 52-39930
discloses a process wherein powder of ammonium polyphosphate
(100 parts by weight) is uniformly mixed with
powder of melamine (60 parts by weight), followed by
heating the mixture at 320째C, cooling and crushing
the resulting melt to obtain powder of a melamine-added
ammonium polyphosphate. However, as to the powder of
melamine-added ammonium polyphosphate obtained according
to the process disclosed in the above publication, since
the melt is crushed, the surface of particles of ammonium
polyphosphate is not uniformly coated by melamine, and
the product is still insufficient in the hygroscopicity,
water-solubility and hydrolytic properties, and moreover
it is necessary to crush the melt.Further, Japanese patent application laid-open
No. Sho 59-207819 and No. Sho 61-103962 disclose that 
ammonium polyphosphate is microcapsulated using a thermosetting
resin such as melamine/formaldehyde resin to
improve the hygroscopicity, water-solubility and
hydrolytic properties. However, according to
