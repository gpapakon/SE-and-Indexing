<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a direction sensor and a method of calibrating a direction sensor having a relative heading sensor (14) and an absolute heading sensor (16). The method allows calibration (22) of both the relative heading sensor (14) and the absolute heading sensor (16) at the same time, by taking advantage of the known angular relationship between maxima and minima on the measurement curve of the absolute heading sensor (16). Such maxima and minima are found by rotating the sensors (12-18) through an angle of at least 360 DEG , reading the absolute and relative heading sensor outputs at numerous points and comparing each successive output. The relative heading sensor output at the minimum is subtracted from that at the maximum, and the difference divided by the known angle to arrive at a conversion constant for the relative heading sensor (14). The center and radii of the measurement curve of the absolute heading sensor (16) may be found by determining the maxima and minima of the curve in two perpendicular directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
direction sensors for route guidance systems for vehicle 
navigation and more specifically, to calibration of a 
relative heading sensor such as a gyroscope. Frequently, route guidance systems navigate 
using dead-reckoning, wherein a vehicle's current 
position is determined by considering a known previous 
position of the vehicle and the direction and distance 
travelled since the previous position. In such dead-reckoning 
systems, it is necessary to track the heading 
or direction of the vehicle relative to a reference 
direction. Usually, such systems utilize both an 
absolute heading sensor, such as a magnetic compass or 
geomagnetic sensor, for sensing vehicle heading relative 
to a reference direction fixed with respect to the earth, 
as well as a relative heading sensor, such as a 
gyroscope, for sensing vehicle heading relative to a 
previous vehicle heading, i.e., the change in vehicle 
heading. In automobile route guidance systems, the 
accuracy of such heading sensors can be significantly 
influenced by a number of factors. For example, the 
presence of local magnetic fields can significantly 
affect magnetic compass readings. Such local magnetic 
fields are created by, for example, mechanisms in the 
vehicle in which the compass is carried, other vehicles 
in the vicinity, or nearby structures. Without periodic 
calibration to compensate for local effects, a magnetic 
compass will produce heading readings with significant 
error. A geomagnetic sensor typically has two outputs 
from two separate windings which produce X and Y 
component signals corresponding to the Earth's magnetic 
field in two directions at right angles from each other.  
 
Ideally, if one was to plot the sensor's X and Y outputs 
at every point as the geomagnetic sensor is turned in a 
complete circle, the output would be a perfect circle 
such as shown in Figure 4. Thus, the direction a vehicle 
is pointing can be determined by comparing the X and Y 
coordinates output from the sensor to the center of the 
circle. In practice, however, the circle typically 
becomes an ellipse such as shown in Figures 5 or 6, due 
to effects discussed above. Relative heading sensors, such as gyroscopes, 
also require periodic calibration. Typically, two 
constants are critical in determining a relative heading 
from such a sensor. One is the sensor output at a 
reference or zero position, commonly called the "zero 
reading". The zero reading is subject to change with 
operating temperatures and
