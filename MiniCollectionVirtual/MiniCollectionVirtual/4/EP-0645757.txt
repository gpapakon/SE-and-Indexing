<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for automatically transcribing an input question from a form 
convenient for user input into a form suitable for use by a computer. The question is a 

sequence of words represented in a form convenient for the user, such as a spoken utterance 
or a handwritten phrase. The question is transduced into a signal that is converted into a 

sequence of symbols. A set of hypotheses is generated from the sequence of symbols. The 
hypotheses are sequences of words represented in a form suitable for use by the computer, 

such as text. One or more information retrieval queries are constructed and executed to 
retrieve documents from a corpus (database). Retrieved documents are analyzed to produce 

an evaluation of the hypotheses of the set and to select one or more preferred hypotheses 
from the set. The preferred hypotheses are output to a display, speech synthesizer, or 

applications program. Additionally, retrieved documents relevant to the preferred hypotheses 
can be selected and output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to systems and methods for transcribing words from a form 
convenient for input by a human user, e.g., spoken or handwritten words, into a form easily 
understood by an applications program executed by a computer, e.g., text. In particular, it 
relates to transcription systems and methods appropriate for use in conjunction with 
computerized information-retrieval (IR) systems and methods, and more particularly to speech-recognition 
systems and methods appropriate for use in conjunction with computerized 
information-retrieval systems and methods used with textual databases. In prior art IR systems, the user typically enters input--either natural-language 
questions, or search terms connected by specialized database commands--by typing at a 
keyboard. Few IR systems permit the user to use speech input, that is, to speak questions or 
search strings into a microphone or other audio transducer. 
An example of an information retrieval system permitting the user to 
use speech input is described in CA-A-1246745.  
 
Systems that do accept speech 
input do not directly use the information in a database of free-text natural-language documents 
to facilitate recognition of the user's input speech. The general problem of disambiguating the words contained in an error-prone 
transcription of user input arises in a number of contexts beyond speech recognition, including 
but not limited to handwriting recognition in pen-based computers and personal digital 
assistants (e.g., the Apple Newton) and optical character recognition. Transcription of user 
input from a form convenient to the user into a form convenient for use by the computer has 
any number of applications, including but not limited to word processing programs, document 
analysis programs, and, as already stated, information retrieval programs. Unfortunately, 
computerized transcription tends to be error-prone. An object of the invention is to provide a technique for using information retrieved 
from a text corpus to automatically disambiguate an error-prone transcription, and more 
particularly to provide a technique for using co-occurrence information in the corpus to 
disambiguate such input. Accordingly, the invention provides a method as claimed in independent claim 1 and 
a system as claimed in independent claim 11. Preferred embodiments of the 
invention are subject-matters of dependent claims. In one embodiment, a processor accepts an input question. The processor is used to 
generate a hypothesis, typically as to a first
