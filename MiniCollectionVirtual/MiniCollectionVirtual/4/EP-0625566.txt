<ABSTRACT>
An electrorheological fluid comprising an 
electrically insulating liquid and acid, iodine or 

alcohol-treated, or iodine-treated and subsequently 
electrically insulating film-coated, dispersible 

carbonaceous particles dispersed therein has a high 
electrorheological effect even without lowering in a 

high temperature region, though it is a water-free 
system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an water-free, 
electrorheological fluid capable of controlling 
the viscosity by application of an electric field. An electrorheological fluid is a suspension 
comprising an electrically insulating liquid and inorganic 
or polymeric particles dispersed therein, whose 
viscosity is rapidly and reversibly changed by applying 
an electric field to the fluid, for example, from a 
liquid state to a plastic state or a solid state and 
vice versa. This phenomenon is called Winslows' effect. Generally, particles whose surfaces can be 
readily polarized by application of an electric field 
are used as dispersible particles. As inorganic dispersible 
particles, silica is disclosed in US Patent No. 
3,047,507; British Patent No. 1,076,754; and Japanese 
Patent Application Kokai (Laid-open) No. 61-44998, and 
zeolite is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application 
Kokai (Laid-open) No. 62-95397. As polymeric dispersible 
particles, alginic acid, carboxyl-containing 
glucose and sulfone-containing glucose are disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-open) No.  
 
51-33783; divinylbenzene-cross-linked polyacrylic acid 
is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-open) 
No. 53-93186; and resol-type phenol resin is 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-open) 
No. 58-179259. Mineral oil, silicone oil, fluorocarbon oil, 
halogenated oil, etc. are known as an electrically 
insulating oil. In the above-mentioned prior art it is 
necessary that water is adsorbed on the surfaces of 
dispersed particles to enhance the electrorheological 
effect, and thus a small amount of water is contained in 
the electrorheological fluid. Mechanism of increasing the viscosity of an 
electrorheological fluid by application of an electric 
field thereto can be clarified according to the electrical 
double layer theory. That is, an electrical 
double layer is formed on the surfaces each of dispersed 
particles in an electrorheological fluid, and when no 
electric field is applied to the electrorheological 
fluid, the particles are repelled from one another on 
their surfaces and are never brought into an alignment 
of dispersed particles. When an electric field is 
applied thereto, an electrical deviation takes place on 
the electrical double layers of the dispersed particles, 
and the dispersed particles are aligned by an electrostatic 
attractive force to form a bridge of dispersed 
particles. Thus, the viscosity of the fluid is  
 
increased, sometimes resulting in
