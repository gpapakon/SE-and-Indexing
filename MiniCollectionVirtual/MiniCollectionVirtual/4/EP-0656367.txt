<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining the efficacy of a therapeutic againt, 
in vitro
, 
for a cancer expressing or overexpressing an oncogene product is described. 

The method is particularly useful for determining the efficacy of therapeutic 

agents that have a binding affinity for cancer that express HER-2/neu. N24, 
N28 and N29 monoclonal antibodies are described which have been identified 

by this method. One or more of these antibodies can be used as a therapeutic 
agent in the treatment of breast, stomach, ovarian or salivary cancers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods for selecting 
putative anti-cancer agents and for determining the efficacy of 
such agents useful in the treatment of a cancer characterized 
by expression of a surface oncogene product. This invention 
further relates generally to compositions selected by such 
methods. The transformation of a normal cell into a malignant cell 
characteristically results, among other things, in the 
uncontrolled proliferation of the progeny cells, which exhibit 
immature, undifferentiated morphology, and expression or 
overexpression of oncogenes not normally expressed by normal, 
mature cells. It is the goal of cancer therapy to selectively 
kill or inhibit the uncontrolled growth of such malignant 
cells, while not adversely effecting normal cells. Traditional chemotherapeutic agents are highly cytotoxic 
agents which preferably have greater affinity for malignant 
cells than normal cells or at least preferentially effect 
malignant cells based on their high rate of metabolic 
activity. Where an oncogene product unique to a malignant cell 
is expressed or overexpressed on its surface membrane, it may 
be used to target such malignant cells for destruction using 
chemotherapeutic agents designed to specifically interact with 
the oncogene product. Extremely precise methods of targeting 
malignant cells for destruction have become available with the 
advent of cytotoxic conjugates, consisting of a potent 
cytotoxin chemically linked to an affinity molecule, such as a 
monoclonal antibody, having specificity for a unique protein 
produced by a malignant cell, such as a cell surface antigen. 
Using immunocytochemical and molecular analyses, it is possible 
to precisely identify the composition and structure of an  
 
oncogenic protein and produce a monoclonal antibody which has 
the capacity to specifically bind the oncogenic protein, and 
thus, increase the accuracy of delivering the cytotoxin to the 
intended target cell. Besides cytotoxic conjugates, it has been proposed to use 
monoclonal antibodies which specifically bind to the surface of 
a cancer cell. Anti-tumor effects of monoclonal antibodies may 
be achieved through the effector function of the antibody 
molecule through natural immunological response to the 
antigen-antibody complex. In this respect, certain monoclonal 
antibodies have been shown to result in a reduction of tumor 
size. Undesirably, however, other monoclonal antibodies which 
specifically bind to such antigens on the surface of the 
malignant cell
