<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to N,N'-substituted asymmetrical imidodicarbonimidic 
diamides derived from hydroxylamines and their derivatives and to processes for 
making them. The related triazine derivatives (Onori, E. and Majori, G. Recent acquisitions 
on chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis of malaria. Ann 1st Super Sanita. 
25:659-74) (1989) are poorly absorbed and have been shown to be less 
effective in eliciting cures when administered orally, as compared to injection, to 
malaria-infected aotus monkeys. The related triazine derivatives, must be 
administered by injection to observe activity comparable to or exceeding other 
known antimalarial drugs. (Knight, D.J. and Peters, W. The antimalarial activity 
of N-benzyloxy dihydrotriazines. I. Ann. Tropical Med. Parasitol. 74:393-404 
(1980). The antimalarial activity of N-benzyl- oxydihydrotriazines. IV. Ann. Trop. 
Med. Parasitol. 76:9-14, Knight, D.J. and Williamson, P. (1982), U.S.-A-4,232,022, 
U.S.-A-4,179,562). Additionally such triazines have been reported 
as poorly tolerated when given by the oral route (Knight, D.J. and Williamson, P. 
(1982) supra). DE-A 824942 to Imperial Chemical Industries discloses 
antimalarial aryl biguanides wherein the aryl group is directly bonded to one of the 
biguanide nitrogens. There are provided novel, pharmaceutically active compounds of the formula 
  
 
and all of its tautomers such as, for example: 
 
all being subsumed under the general designation of formula I. Any one of these 
formulae used herein shall be considered as the equivalent of and subsume the 
others. In Formula I :  
 
R1 is a substituted or unsubstituted divalent aliphatic group of 1 to 16 carbon 
atoms; wherein the substituents are mono or poly and are selected from the 
group consisting of lower alkyl, aryl and aralkyl, R3 is selected from the group consisting of same group of values as R5 other 
than carbocycloaryl, and may also form, with the nitrogen to which it is 
attached a saturated heterocycle of 4-8 carbon atoms, R5 is selected from the group consisting of substituted and unsubstituted: alkyl 
of 1-10 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl of 3-8 carbon atoms, mono 
and polycarbocycloaryl of 4-7 atoms per ring, wherein the substituents are mono or poly and are selected from the group 
consisting of lower alkyl, halo lower alkyl, cycloalkyl of 3-8 carbon atoms, 
lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, nitro, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl,
