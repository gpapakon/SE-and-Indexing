<ABSTRACT>
In the detection of the movement of a yarn storage limit on the storage surface of a storage body of a yarn storage and feed device, different sensing properties of at least two storage-surface circumference portions offset in the circumferential direction are sensed simultaneously and are converted into non-identical storage-surface signals which are discriminated by the same sensors in relation to identical yarn signals which are formed from the sensing property of the yarn turns when the yarn store is present in the sensing zone. On a yarn storage and feed device (F) suitable for carrying out the method, there are provided first and second storage-surface circumference portions (8, 9) with sensing properties (A, B) different from one another and a plurality of sensors (SA, SB, S) which are spaced from one another approximately in the circumferential direction of the storage body (1), in such a way that at least one first storage-surface circumference portion (8) can be sensed by one sensor and simultaneously a second storage-surface circumference portion (9) can be sensed by at least one further sensor.
