<ABSTRACT>
A substituted or an unsubstituted phenylglyoxal is prepared from a corresponding substituted or unsubstituted acetophenone by oxidizing the substituted or unsubstituted acetophenone to form a corresponding substituted or unsubstituted phenylglyoxalacetal in a reactor and hydrolyzing the phenylglyoxalacetal in the same reactor to form the substituted or unsubstituted phenylglyoxal. Furthermore, the substituted phenylglyoxal is prepared from a corresponding substituted or unsubstituted acetophenone by reacting the substituted or unsubstituted acetophenone in water with a source of a nitrosonium ion in the presence of a strong acid.

 PREPARATION OF SUBSTITUTED OR UNSUBSTITUTED PHENYLGLYOXALSRELATED APPLICATIONS This application is related to correspondingUnited States Patent Application Serial No. 07/755,913 filed on September 6, 1991.TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to substituted and unsubstituted phenylglyoxals and, more particularly, to a method for the preparation thereof. Still more particularly, the present invention discloses methods for preparing substituted and unsubstituted phenylglyoxals from corresponding substituted and unsubstituted acetophenones.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Substituted phenylglyoxals such as hydroxyphenyl- glyoxal (hereinafter referred to sometimes as "HPGO") are well known compounds that are useful in the production of intermediate products which are utilized for the preparation of pharmaceutical products. In Organic Syntheses. Coll Vol. 2, A. Blatt, ed. , (1943) at p. 509, a method is disclosed for the production of unsubstituted phenylglyoxals from an acetophenone. That method uses the toxic substance selenium dioxide (Se02) thereby posing undesirable health hazards and disposal problems.D. T. Manning and H. A. Stansbury, Jr., J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 81, 4885-90 (1959) discloses the reaction of an unsubstituted acetophenone with nitrosyl chloride in ethanol to give a 12.4 percent yield of phenylglyoxal diethyl acetal. In addition other reaction products are generated in that reaction. 

 U.S. Patent No. 4,013,680 discloses a two-step method for the preparation of α-keto acids such as phenylglyoxylic acid by the oxidation of methyl ketones in aqueous solution with an inorganic nitrite salt and hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. It suggests that the reaction proceeds via the formation of a glyoxal intermediate.U.S. Patent No. 4,272,453 discloses a method for the preparation of 1-chloro-l-p-methoxybenzoylformal- doxime bytheadditionofp-methoxyacetophenone to nitrosyl chloride in carbon tetrachloride. U.S. Patent No. 3,794,620 discloses the reaction of nitrosyl chloride with aromatic acetyl derivatives. According to that patent, three moles of nitrosyl chloride are required for each acetal group.German Patent DE 2,432,563 discloses the oxidation of substituted acetophenones using alkyl nitrites in alcohol and hydrochloric acid to prepare substituted phenylglyoxalacetals. German Patent DE 3,539,629 discloses a method of oxidizing substituted acetophenones using dinitrogen trioxide in alcohol/hydrochloric acid to prepare appropriate substituted phenylglyoxal acetals.Copending
