<ABSTRACT>
Arranged within the peripheral border (3) of a floor panel (1) with a panel surface (2) is at least one prefabricated cutout (4, 5) which exhibits supporting surfaces (4a, 4b) for insert panels (6, 7, 8) as well as the insert panels themselves. In this arrangement, the vertical distance (S) of the supporting surfaces (4a, 4b) from the panel surface (2) corresponds essentially to the thickness (D) of the insert panels (6, 7, 8). In order to make provision for universal possible applications, with the smallest opening cross-sections possible, the at least one cutout (4, 5) has a rectangular outline and exhibits, on opposite sides of its periphery, the supporting surfaces (4a, 4b), which run parallel to one another in pairs. Furthermore, at least in each case two prefabricated insert panels (6, 7, 8) with a rectangular outline can be inserted one beside the other into the at least one cutout (4, 5), in the longitudinal direction of the cutout, which insert panels are optionally provided with through-passages (6a, 8b) or are designed at least in an essentially continuous manner.
