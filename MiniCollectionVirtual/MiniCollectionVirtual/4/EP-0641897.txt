<ABSTRACT>
A housing device intended for fitting in the pavement of a road 
surface, footpath and the like, such as a junction box for cables, opens 

out on the surface of the pavement, and has sides (2, 3) which form an 
interior space and bound an access opening near their top end. In order 

to also give the device a sufficiently great stability when made of 
plastic, the sides each have an inside wall (5) and an outside wall (4) 

which are situated a distance apart, which walls (4, 5) of one side (2, 
3) in each case are interconnected by ribs (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a housing device intended for fitting 
in the pavement of a road surface, footpath and the like, the device being 
made of plastic and opening out on the surface of the pavement, which device comprises sides 
forming an interior space and bounding an access opening near their top 
end, which sides each have an inside wall and an outside wall which are 
situated a distance apart. Such a housing device is known from US-A-5181793. This known 
housing device consists of a plastic and comprises double-walled sides 
and a bottom, the walls of each side and bottom being interconnected by 
horizontal ribs. In practice it has been found that such plastic housing device 
is unable to withstand the loads to which it is exposed. The sides of the 
device therefore have to be stabilized subsequently by pouring concrete 
around the device, which is time-consuming and expensive. The object of the invention is therefore to provide a device of 
the type mentioned above which is also sufficiently stable when made of 
plastic. This object is achieved through the fact that the walls of one 
side in each case are interconnected by vertical ribs, said ribs being 
mutually spaced and extending essentially over the entire height of the walls.  
 The walls which are interconnected by vertical ribs give the device 
great stability, also as regards pressure loads. This means that the 
plastic construction also has sufficient resistance to high traffic 
loads. On the other hand, the quantity of material can remain limited, 
which makes handling easier. A device designed in this way is also 
extremely easy to manufacture by injection moulding. The stability can be increased even further if the distance 
between the walls increases from the top end. The support in the ground below can be improved if the inside 
walls are interconnected at their bottom end by a bottom; the outside 
walls may, if desired, have an outward pointing flange at their bottom 
end. As already mentioned, the device according to the invention can  
 
be used for different purposes. We mention as a first example an 
embodiment as a junction box, comprising such a device and also a cover, 
which device has four sides which together form a square or rectangle, 
which sides have supporting means for the cover at their top end. The inside wall of each side can have at its top end an inward 
displaced area which forms a supporting flange for the cover. In that 
connection a supporting ring can also be provided, which supporting ring 
has a
