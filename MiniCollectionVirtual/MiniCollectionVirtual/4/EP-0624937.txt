<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a carbon brush (10) having an indicating braid (26, 28) for indicating a specific amount of wear of the carbon brush. The indicating braid is rammed into a blind hole (30) and is arranged at a distance from the base (32) of the blind hole. In order that unambiguous indication of the amount of carbon brush wear is ensured, the base of the blind hole is covered with a layer (40) consisting of insulating material.

<CLAIMS>
A carbon brush (10) with a braided indicator wire (26, 28) for indicating a defined 
wear of the carbon brush, wherein the braided indicator wire is embedded in a recess 

(30), such as a blind bore, preferably extending in the longitudinal direction (16) of 
the carbon brush and is spaced apart from the bottom (32) of the recess, wherein 

insulating material is disposed on the bottom,
characterized in that
 
the insulating material is an inherently rigid insulating layer (40) in the form of an 

insulating plate or an insulating lamina covering the bottom (32) of the recess (30). 
A carbon brush in accordance with Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the insulating plate (40) or insulating lamina, respectively, consists of a fiber material 

or resin-bonded paper. 
A carbon brush in accordance with Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 
the braided indicating wire (26, 28) touches the insulating layer (40) with its free end 

(42) or rests on it. 
A carbon brush in accordance with at least one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
the sides of the braided indicating wire (26, 28) are embedded in an insulating 

material, such as tamped-down powder. 
A carbon brush in accordance with at least one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
  
 

the thickness (b) of the insulating layer (40) is equal to the distance (a) between the 
outside of the core (36) of the braided indicating wire (26, 28) and the inner wall of 

the recess (30). 
A carbon brush in accordance with at least one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
the tamped-down powder and the material of the insulating layer (40) have the same 

or nearly the same specific resistances. 
A carbon brush in accordance with at least one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
a coating (44) covering the tamped-down powder extends between the braided 

indicating wire (28) and the surface of the carbon brush. 
A carbon brush in accordance with at least one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
the section (26) of the braided indicating wire (28) is enclosed by a sleeve (50) 

preferably consisting of metal, such as a crimped sleeve, wherein the outside and the 
rim of the sleeve are preferably completely enclosed by tamped-down powder. 
A method for disposing and fastening a segment of the braided indicator wire in a 
carbon brush in accordance with at least Claim 1 comprising the method steps 


a blind bore with a level or essentially level bottom is drilled, 
an inherently rigid insulating layer covering the bottom of the blind bore is 

inserted, 
the section of the braided indicator wire is inserted into the blind bore until its 
end touches the insulating plate, 
the braided indicator wire is embedded in insulating material and, if required, 
the tamped-down powder is coated. 
A method in accordance with Claim 9,
characterized in that
 
prior to its insertion into the blind bore the section of the braided indicator wire to be 

inserted into the blind bore is at least partially enclosed in a sleeve.  
 
A method in accordance with Claim 9,
characterized in that
 
a flat insulating material, which is to be wound off a roll, is passed over the blind 

bore and the insulating plate is punched out directly above the blind bore in such a 
way that immediately following this the insulating plate can be inserted into the blind 

bore by means of the punching tool or a part thereof. 
A method in accordance with at least one of Claims 9 to 11,
characterized in that
 
the braided indicator wire is cut to size by means of a cutting tool, wherein a voltage 

is applied between the latter and the carbon brush to check the insulated arrangement 
of the braided indicator wire section in the blind bore.
