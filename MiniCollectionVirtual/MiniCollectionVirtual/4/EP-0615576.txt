<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to operator carried
power tools and more particularly, to operator carried
power tools driven by a small internal combustion
engine.Portable operator carried power tools such as
line trimmers, blower/vacuums, or chain saws are
currently powered by two-cycle internal combustion
engines or electric motors. With the growing concern
regarding air pollution, there is increasing pressure to
reduce the emissions of portable power equipment.
Electric motors unfortunately have limited applications
due to power availability for corded products and
battery life for cordless devices. In instances where
weight is not an overriding factor such as lawn mowers,
emissions can be dramatically reduced by utilizing
heavier four-cycle engines. When it comes to operator
carried power tools such as line trimmers, chain saws
and blower/vacuums, four-cycle engines pose a very
difficult problem. Four-cycle engines tend to be too
heavy for a given horsepower output and lubrication
becomes a very serious problem since operator carried
power tools must be able to run in a very wide range of
orientations.The California Resource Board (CARB) in 1990
began to discuss with the industry, particularly the
Portable Power Equipment Manufacturer's Association 
(PPEMA), the need to reduce emissions. In responding to
the CARB initiative, the PPEMA conducted a study to
evaluate the magnitude of emissions generated by two-cycle
engines in an effort to determine whether they
were capable of meeting the proposed preliminary CARB
standards tentatively scheduled to go into effect in
1994. The PPEMA study concluded that at the present
time, there was no alternative power source to replace
the versatile lightweight two-stroke engine currently
used in hand held products. Four-cycle engines could
only be used in limited situations, such as in portable
wheeled products like lawn mowers or generators, where
the weight of the engine did not have to be borne by the
operator.US-A- 4,286,675 discloses a portable operator
carried power tool having a frame to be carried by an
operator, an implement co-operating with the frame and
having a rotary driven input member and an internal
combustion engine attached to the frame and provided
with an output member coupled to the implement input
member.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a hand held powered tool which is powered by an
internal combustion engine having low emissions and is
sufficiently light to be carried by an operator.It is a further object of the present
invention
