<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides the use in the manufacture of a medicament for 
treatment of graft-versus-host disease of hydroxychloroquine. The invention also 

provides the use in the manufacture of a medicament for suppressing alloreactivity 
arising from reaction of donor T lymphocytes against recipient cells of 

hydroxychloroquine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of treatments for graft-versus-host 
disease arising after transplantation of donor cells into a host. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to the use of hydroxychloroquine (2-[[4-[(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)amino]pentyl]ethylamino]ethanol) 
for prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host 
disease. Whenever a patient with a profound immunodeficiency (primary, secondary, or 
iatrogenic) receives a graft of an organ rich in immunocompetent cells there is a 
considerable risk that a graft-versus-host reaction may develop. Such reactions are a 
significant problem in infants and children with primary immunodeficiencies on whom 
a bone marrow transplant is performed with the goal of reconstituting the immune 
system and in patients receiving a bone marrow transplant for the treatment of 
malignancy. Many patients receiving bone marrow transplants have received 
cytotoxic/immunosuppressive therapy and their immune system is completely or 
partially destroyed. Allogeneic bone marrow transplants have been demonstrated to be of use in 
curing patients with hematological malignancies, aplastic anemia, and congenital 
immunodeficiency and metabolic diseases. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant 
involves the transfer of hematopoeitic and immunocompetent lymphoid elements from a 
donor into a recipient. The transfer is preceded by bone marrow ablative high-dose 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy aimed at eliminating the recipient's underlying 
malignancy and/or at suppressing the recipient's immune system (to prevent rejection of 
the foreign tissue). The recipient's bone marrow is then repopulated with donor stem 
cells. These donor cells also lead to reconstitution of the recipient's immune system. The major complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplant has been the 
development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) mediated by donor T lymphocytes 
that attack tissues (mainly skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver) of the recipient. Graft-versus-host  
 
disease can be manifested both acutely (within weeks of transplant) or 
chronically (lasting from months to years after bone marrow transplant and usually 
following acute graft-versus-host disease). Acute graft-versus-host disease is 
manifested by a maculopapular, erythematous rash, diarrhea and hepatitis. Immune 
reconstitution is also impaired resulting in a prolonged severe immunosuppression. 
Chronic graft-versus-host disease resembles autoimmune disorders in the development 
of sclerotic and mucous
