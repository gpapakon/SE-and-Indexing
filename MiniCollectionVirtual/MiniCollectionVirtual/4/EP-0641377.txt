<ABSTRACT>
Mild surfactant mixtures contain: (a) 10 to 40 % by weight of an alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglucoside having formula (I): R
<
1
>
-O-[G]p, in which R
<
1
>
 stands for an alkyl and/or alkenyl residue with 8 to 11 carbon atoms, [G] stands for a glucose residue and p represents a number from 1 to 10; (b) 10 to 40 % by weight of an alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglucoside having formula (II): R
<
2
>
-O-[G]p, in which R
<
2
>
 stands for an alkyl and/or alkenyl residue with 12 to 22 carbon atoms, [G] for a glucose residue and p represents a number from 1 to 10; and (c) 80 to 20 % by weight of an alkyl ether sulphate having formula (III): R
<
3
>
-(OCH2CH2)nO-SO3M, in which R
<
3
>
 stands for an alkyl and/or alkenyl residue with 6 to 22 carbon atoms, M for an alkali, earthy base, ammonium and/or alkanol ammonium ion and n represents a number from 1 to 20. These mild surfactant mixtures have a high dermatological tolerability and may be used to produce manual dish washing agents as well as cosmetics.
