<ABSTRACT>
A wheel load sensor (10), which is intended for building into a recess in the surface of a roadway for the selective detection of the vertical directional component of a pressure proceeding from a wheel load simultaneously comprises a piezoelectric measuring element (11), a conductor functioning as an inner electrode (12), and a hollow conductor (13') as outer electrode which, to fix a measurement axis necessary for the selective directional detection, clamps wall sections (16), running approximately parallel to the plane of the road surface, of the piezoelectric measuring element, while the remaining wall sections (16') of the piezoelectric measuring element are accommodated in the hollow conductor (13') at a distance from its other wall sections. In the built-in position, the measurement axis, which coincides with the clamping axis (P), is aligned perpendicular to the surface of the road surface. Since the wall sections (16') which are spaced apart from the hollow conductor (13'), of the piezoelectric measuring element (11) lie approximately transversely to the measurement axis, the transmission of horizontal pressure components of incoming pressure waves to the piezoelectric element (11) is largely avoided.

Wheel load sensor, which is positioned in a casting mass, for installation in a
recess of a road surface or the like, with a piezoelectric measuring element which is

constructed as a cable and encloses a conductor serving as an inner electrode and which
is enclosed by at least one hollow conductor as outer electrode as well as is installable in

the surface of a travel path, characterised thereby that those wall sections (16) of the
piezoelectric measuring element (11) which in the installed position extend approximately

parallel to the road surface are received, under predetermined pressure stress between
adjoining wall regions, of the hollow conductor (13') forming the outer electrode and the

remaining wall sections (16') of the piezoelectric measuring element (11), in the hollow
conductor at a spacing from the other walls thereof.
Wheel load sensor according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the expansion
of the hollow conductor (13') in the clamping-in direction of the piezoelectric measuring

element (11) is smaller than in a direction perpendicular thereto.
Wheel load sensor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the hollow
conductor (13) enclosing the piezoelectric measuring element (11) has an approximately

oval cross-section.
Wheel load sensor according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby that
the wall sections (16), which bear under pressure stress against the hollow conductor

Wheel load sensor according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby that the
piezoelectric measuring element (11) is positioned by an open upper side (23) in a profile

pipe (15) which - in the installed position - extends transversely to the travel direction.
Wheel load sensor according to claim 5, characterised thereby that the profile pipe

Wheel load sensor according to claim 6, characterised thereby that the web (20) of
the profile pipe (15') is constructed as a stand foot with edge flanges (25, 25') projecting at

both sides beyond its limbs (21, 21').
Wheel load sensor according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised by a protection
against the ingress of moisture between the inner electrode (12) and the piezoelectric

measuring element (11), which surrounds this, by means of a connecting adapter (31),
wherein the end of the inner electrode (12), which projects beyond the hollow conductor

(13'), is received in a slot (30) of the adapter (31) and the region of the adapter
surrounding the slot (30) is sealingly connected with the piezoelectric measuring element

(11).
Wheel load element according to claim 8, characterised thereby that the
connecting adapter (31) is an H-shaped metal conductor in which the slot (30), which

receives one end of the inner electrode (12), extends out from one end face and which at
the slot side is tightly enclosed by an end portion (32) of a casing forming the piezoelectric

measuring element (11).
Method of producing a wheel load sensor according to one of claims 1 to 9,

Method according to claim 10, characterised by use of a hollow conductor (13')
which is originally round in cross-section and which is brought, in the flattening process,

into a form which is oval in cross-section.
