<ABSTRACT>
In a lifting beam with two profiled rails (1) of identical design arranged in mirror image and connected to one another as well as elements (10, 12, 14) for hanging the beam on a lifting appliance or the like and for hanging a load on the beam, the cross-sectional profile of the profiled rails (1) consists of two hook-shaped sections arranged in mirror image relative to the longitudinal centre line. Furthermore, the two profiled rails (1) form a hollow box, the top side and bottom side of which are each formed by two of the end areas, pointing towards one another, of the hook-shaped sections of the cross-sectional profile.
