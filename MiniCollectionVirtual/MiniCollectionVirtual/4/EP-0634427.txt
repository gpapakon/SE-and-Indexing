<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel higher α-olefin
copolymer, a process for the preparation of the
copolymer, a rubber composition comprising the copolymer
and a rubber molded product comprising a vulcanized product
of the copolymer. More particularly, the invention relates
to a higher α-olefin copolymer, a rubber composition and a
rubber molded product which not only have excellent
dynamic fatigue resistance (flexural fatigue resistance),
weathering resistance, ozone resistance, thermal aging
resistance and low-temperature characteristics but also
processability, compatibility with aromatic ring-containing
polymers such as styrene/butadiene rubber (SBR) and
covulcanizability therewith and which can be used for, for example,
various rubber products and resin modifiers.Diene rubbers such as natural rubbers, isoprene
rubber, SBR and BR have been widely used for, for example, tyres,
automotive parts and industrial parts because of their 
excellent processability and strength. Further, natural
rubbers have excellent dynamic fatigue resistance.However, the diene rubbers have a problem of a short
life on account that they have a low weathering resistance
and ozone resistance; especially natural rubbers have
a low heat resistance and ozone resistance.As rubber materials for an automotive tyre tread, diene
rubbers such as blends of styrene/butadiene copolymer
rubbers and a polybutadiene rubber have generally been
used. However, the tyre tread formed from only the
styrene/butadiene copolymer rubber has a high rolling
resistance and low abrasion resistance because of its low
repulsion elasticity at 50 to 70 °C, though it has
relatively good damping properties on a wet road
surface (wet skid). For coping with this problem, there
has been used a blend obtained by blending 100 parts by
weight of the styrene/butadiene copolymer rubber with 10 to
50 parts by weight of the polybutadiene rubber.With the desire to save energy in recent years,
a drastic reduction in the fuel cost and a high abrasion
resistance have been demanded. In addition damping
properties on the wet road surface have been also demanded
from the viewpoint of safety. However, the blend of the
conventional styrene/butadiene copolymer rubber and the
polybutadiene rubber has insufficient damping
properties. For improving those properties, a blend of a
halogenated butyl rubber and a polybutadiene rubber has
been proposed, but this blend still has insufficient
damping properties, abrasion resistance and rolling
resistance.Hence, the advent of a rubber
