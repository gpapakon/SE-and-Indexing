<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for improving the 
selectivity of a gas separation membrane wherein a fluoropolymer is 
applied to the surface of the membrane to effectively seal defects in the 
membrane. Polymeric membranes are well known for the separation of 
one or more gases from a mixture of gases. The selectivity of one gas 
over another in a multicomponent mixture by permeation through a gas 
separation membrane is controlled, in part, by the integrity of the 
separating layer of the membrane. To obtain the intrinsic gas selectivity 
of a membrane, a substantially pinhole-free separating layer must be 
formed in the membrane formation process. The integrity of this 
separating layer must be maintained throughout the gas separation module 
to retain a high gas membrane selectivity. This idealized pinhole-free 
membrane separating layer could be prepared by increasing the thickness 
of the layer. In doing so, holes, defects or imperfections would not be 
able to protrude through the separating layer; however, this results in a 
reduction of the gas permeation rate through the membrane. Imperfections and defects in the dense separating layer of gas 
membranes arise in the membrane formation process and in subsequent 
membrane handling, module fabrication and system fabrication steps. 
The effective gas membrane separating efficiency can be advantageously 
enhanced by chemical treatment of the membranes to heal or seal most of 
the imperfections and defects. It is known to prepare composite membranes and/or posttreat 
membranes with materials that seal or heal defects or improve the stability 
of the membrane. For example, U.S. Patents 3,616,607 and 3,775,303 
exemplify gas separation membranes having superimposed membranes on 
a porous support.  U.S. Patent 4,230,463 deals broadly with the posttreatment of 
fluid separation membranes. It describes a wide variety of membranes for 
liquid and gas separations, particularly a multicomponent membrane 
where the separation properties of the membrane are principally 
determined by the porous separation membrane as opposed to the material 
of the coating. The coating cures defects in the surface of the membrane. 
U.S. Patent 4,767,422 also discloses a method of posttreating composite 
membranes to cure defects in the thin separation layer. U.S. Patent 
4,728,345 describes a multicomponent membrane for gas separation 
having a polyphosphazene coating in occluding contact with a porous 
separation membrane for the purpose of improving stability of
