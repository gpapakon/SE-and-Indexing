<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a process for the preparation of (+)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-hydroxybutylamine (I) by reaction of 3,4-dichlorophenylacetonitrile (II) with an alkaline (alkali metal) haloacetate, treatment of 3-cyano-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)propionic acid (III) with D-(-)-N-methylglucamine, with second-order asymmetric transformation, hydrolysis of the D-(-)-N-methylglucamine salt of (-)-3-cyano-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)propionic acid and reduction of the laevorotatory (levorotatory) cyanoacid thus obtained with a borane under conditions which preserve chirality.

Process for the preparation of (+)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-hydroxybutylamine 
of formula (I): 


 
characterized in that 


(a) the 3,4-dichlorophenylacetonitrile of formula (II): 

 
   is treated with an alkali metal halogenoacetate in liquid ammonia or in a 

polar aprotic solvent, in the presence of a strong base, at a temperature of 
-40°C to +25°C; 
(b) the resulting racemic 3-cyano-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)propionic acid of 
formula (III): 


 
   is treated with D-(-)-N-methylglucamine in order to crystallize all the acid 

(III) in the form of the D-(-)-N-methylglucamine salt of the levorotatory 
acid; 
(c) said salt is treated with a strong acid; and 
(d) the thus freed (-)-3-cyano-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)propionic acid of 
formula (IV):  

 

 
is subjected to an enantioconservative reduction with a borane. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that step (a) is 
carried out in liquid ammonia at a temperature of -40 to -30°C. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that step (a) is 
carried out in the presence of sodium amide or sodium 
tert
-butylate. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that step (a) is 
carried out in a polar aprotic solvent which is inert under the reaction 

conditions. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
sodium chloroacetate is used as the alkali metal halogenoacetate. 
Process for the preparation of (-)-3-cyano-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)propionic 
acid, characterized in that the racemic 3-cyano-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)propionic 

acid is treated with D-(-)-N-methylglucamine 
and the resulting D-(-)-N-methylglucamine salt of (-)-3-cyano-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)propionic 

acid is treated with a strong acid.
