<ABSTRACT>
A center-compensation master cylinder (10) has first (20) and second (30) pistons with center-compensation valve members (27, 37). The pistons (20, 30) have diametrically extending slots (22, 32) at central axial portions thereof through which extend pin members (53, 54) to effect opening of the valve members (27, 37) when the pistons (20, 30) are in at-rest positions. A first spring (29) extends between a head (24) of the first piston (20) and the second piston (30), and a second spring (39) extends between an end (15) of the bore (14) and the head (34) of the second piston (30). The first spring (29) is caged via a caging mechanism (60) ensuring that the first (20) and second (30) pistons will travel simultaneously when the centre-compensation valve members (27, 37) are closing. The caging mechanism (60) is adjustable to control accurately the location of the second piston (30) in an at-rest position. The caging mechanism comprises an end part (47) non-rotatably and axially coupled with longitudinal extensions (40) of the head (24) of the first piston (20), a member (65) adjustably coupled with a threaded end (47C) of the end part (47), and a head (66) of the member (65) abutting a cage end member (70) which seats at a back portion (31) of the second piston (30). The cage end member (70) is cup-shaped and includes a radially flared lip (74) providing a seat for one end of the first spring (29) while the other end of the first spring (29) is received at a diametral extension (28) of the first piston (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
 CENTER VALVE MASTER CYLINDER WITH ADJUSTABLE CAGED PRIMARY SPRINGThe present invention relates generally to tandem master cylinders, and in particular to tandem master cylinders with center-compensation valve members.Tandem master cylinders with center-compensation valve members have been provided previously such as in Schaefer U. S. Patent No. 4,550,567. A center-compensation valve member may be a part of a caging mechanism for the respective spring. It is desirable to provide a caging mechanism for the primary spring and which does not affect the center-compensation valve mechanism of the primary piston. The caging mechanism should be adjustable so that the at-rest position of the second piston may be accurately determined and thus minimize the tolerances involved in effecting the closing of the center-compensation valve member of the second piston. Additionally, the caging mechanism for the primary spring should ensure that the first and second pistons travel simultaneously while the center- compensation valves are closing during actuation.The present invention provides solutions to the above problems by providing a tandem master cylinder, comprising a housing having therein an axial bore, first and second pistons located within the bore and defining therewith respective first and second pressure chambers, each piston including a head part having a valve member located within a through opening of the head part, and a diametral opening, a pair of axially spaced- apart pins extending into said bore and received within the diametral openings of the respective first and second pistons, each valve member engaging a respective pin in a rest position of the respective piston so that the valve member is open and permits fluid flow through the respective through opening, a first spring extending between the head part of the first piston and a rear portion of said second piston, and a second spring extending between the head part of the second piston and end of said bore, the improvement comprising the first spring being maintained by a caging mechanism which controls the extension of the first spring such that the location of the second piston in an at-rest position is accurately controlled, 

the caging mechanism comprising the head part of the firs piston having a pair of longitudinal extensions definin diametrically opposed circumferential slots communicating wit a central opening located between the longitudinal extensions, the extensions having shoulders adjacent the central opening, an end part having
