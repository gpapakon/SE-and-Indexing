<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides drug-ligand
conjugates wherein the ligand is connected to the drug
moiety through a peptide linker made up of a protein
peptide specifier, an acyl unit, and a self-immolating
spacer, and which conjugates are activated
by lysosomal enzymes.Bipartate compounds consisting of a carrier or
linker moiety and a drug moiety are known. These
compounds have been particularly useful in the
formation of immunoconjugates directed against tumor
associated antigens. In certain cases, however,
bipartate compounds may be unstable due to the
inherent nature of the bond linking the antibodies to
the drug or due to the electronic or steric features
of the drug moiety which may hinder hydrolysis of the
bond by the desired target enzyme. Katzenellenbogen,
J. Amer. Chem. Soc., (1981) 24: 479-480.WO 90/03401 discloses conjugates in which a targeting
substance is bound to a diagnostic/therapeutic agent via
Schiff base linkages. A reversible (acid-cleavable) attachment
of the diagnostic/therapeutic agent to a targeting substance
is provided.Conjugates comprising a biodegradable polymeric carrier, such
as polyglutamic acid, are described in WO 88/00837.In Umemoto et al., Int. J. Cancer Vol. 43, 677-684 (1989) a
methotrexate-anti-MM46 monoclonal antibody conjugate via a
oligopeptide spacer is prepared and evaluated for its in vitro
cytotoxicity.Poly-L-glutamic acid derivates are used in Tsukada et al.,
JNCI. Vol. 73, 721-729 (1984) for conjugating daunorubicin
with an affinity-purified horse antibody to rat α-fetoprotein.In U.S. 5,013,547 daunorubicin is reacted with p-(isothiocyanato)-benzoylchloride
or p-(isothiocyanato)phenyl-propionylchloride
and the resulting daunorubicin analogs are
conjugated with an antibody to give cytotoxic conjugates.Lysosomotropic drug-carrier conjugates are described in Trouet
et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 79, 626-629 (1982).
These conjugates have a covalent linkage between daunorubicin
and proteins that is said to be stable in serum and reversible
by lysosomal hydrolysis. The best therapeutic results were
obtained with the conjugates formed with tri- and
tetrapeptidic spacer arms, i.e. albumin-Leu-Ala-Leudaunorubicin
and albumin-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu-daunorubicin.The present invention provides tumor specific,
drug-ligand conjugates composed of a ligand, a drug,
and a peptide linker, which conjugate is selectively
activatible at the site of the tumor.The drug-ligand conjugates of this invention
comprise at least one drug molecule, a ligand capable
of targeting a
