<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for treating or arresting the progress of pathologies characterized by an accumulation of extracellular matrix components by providing an agent to suppress the activity of transforming growth factor  beta  (TGF- beta ) a peptide growth factor which is anabolic and leads to fibrosis and angiogenesis. Pathologies which can be so treated include the various fibrotic diseases such as fibrotic cancer, fibrosis of the lungs, arteriosclerosis, post myocardial infarction, cardiac fibrosis, post-angioplasty restenosis, renal interstitial fibrosis, scarring and diabetic nephropathy. The present invention further provides methods for treating diabetes and pharmaceutical compositions useful in such methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
Various pathologies are characterized by a
deleterious accumulation of extracellular matrix materials.
For example, in progressive glomerular disease,
extracellular matrix accumulates in the mesangium or along
the glomerular basement membrane, eventually causing end-stage
disease and uremia. Similarly, adult or acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) involves the
accumulation of matrix materials in the lung, while
cirrhosis of the liver is characterized by deleterious
matrix accumulation evidenced by scarring in the liver.Diabetes is now the most common cause of
progressive kidney failure and also leads to conditions
characterized by the deleterious accumulation of
extracellular matrix components. The introduction of
insulin revolutionized the treatment of diabetes and
dramatically lengthened patient survival. However, insulin
has not been effective in preventing such serious
complications as diabetic nephropathy. Although strict
control of blood glucose, treatment of hypertension, and
restriction of dietary protein may slow the rate at which
kidney function is lost, there is a steady progression to
end-stage disease.The central pathological feature of diabetic
nephropathy is accumulation of extracellular matrix within
the glomeruli. The factors in the diabetic milieu
responsible for extracellular matrix accumulation are
poorly understood. Extracellular matrix is a mixture of proteoglycans, glycoproteins
and collagens assembled into a complex superstructure.
Although a variety of immunologic, hemodynamic and toxic factors
have been used experimentally to induce glomerular disease, none
of these factors has been shown to directly influence synthesis
or degradation of extracellular matrix components. Thus it seems
likely that there is another intervening process between acute
cell injury and buildup of glomerular extracellular matrix.Thus, a need exists to determine the factors which regulate
deleterious accumulation of matrix components in pathological
states such as kidney disease. Further, there exists a need to
control such factors so as to prevent, limit or treat pathogenic
conditions which include inappropriate matrix accumulation. The
present invention satisfies these needs and provides related
advantages as well. The present invention relates to the use of decorin or biglycan
for the preparation of a medicament for preventing or
treating a pathology characterized by an accumulation of extracellular
matrix in a tissue, wherein said pathology is diabetes-associated
pathology. In a particular
