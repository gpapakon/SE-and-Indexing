<ABSTRACT>
A method of separating, or destacking, sheets (3) from one another in a stack (2) comprises the steps that two separator devices (1) are brought into contact with opposing edges of the stack (2) and that the sheet (3) is subjected by each separator device (1) to a force with a first component at right angles up from the stack (2) and a second component in the plane of the sheet and from the separator device (1) in towards the stack (2). As separator device (1), use is made of a worm or screw (12). An apparatus for separating, or destacking, sheets (3) in a stack (2) comprises at least one separator device (1) with a number of engagement members which, seen from the stack, move in a feeding direction (5) in order, by engagement with the stack (2), to separate sheets (3) piecewise from the stack. At upper, opposing edges of the stack (2), separator devices (1) are disposed in engagement with the stack. The feeding directions (5) thereof incline inwardly and upwardly towards a point over the stack (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of destacking, or separating, from
one another sheet or panel-shaped, substantially planar objects such as
sheet metal members which form a stack, the separation being effected in a
separation direction which is substantially parallel with a normal to the
plane of those objects which are to be separated and is executed by at least
one separator device.The present invention also relates to an apparatus for destacking, or
separating, sheet or panel-shaped, substantially planar objects such as
sheet metal members which form a stack, comprising at least one separator
device such as a screw or the like which presents to the stack a number of
engagement members which, seen from the stack, are movable in a feeding
direction in order, by engagement with the stack, to separate objects
therefrom piecewise.In the production of various products of sheet metal by pressing, use is often
made of sheet metal blanks which are piled into stacks in which the
individual blanks lie directly on top of one another. The sheet metal blanks
often carry an oil film, which entails that they show a manifest tendency to
adhere to one another. On removal of the sheet metal blanks for further
processing in a press or press line, use is made of different forms of
gripping devices which, for example, may consist of suction cups which are
applied to the uppermost sheet in the stack and which lift the sheet from the
stack and move the sheet into the tool in the press.If the sheets consist of magnetic material, the adhesive action of the oil film
can be cancelled out by magnetic separators which prevent the suction
cups from taking two or more sheets at the same time, which would cause
immediate operational stoppage in the pressing operation. If the sheets consist of non-magnetic material, for example aluminium, the
technique employing magnetic separation will not function, for which
reason adhesion between the sheet blanks implies almost constant
operational stoppage.In other technical fields of application in which separation of members or
objects disposed in a stack has been brought into consideration, use has
been made of screw-shaped separator devices which, with their threads,
grip in between adjacent objects and lift out the uppermost object from the
stack. In such instance, the axes of rotation of the screws are parallel with
the edge of the stack, i.e. also parallel with a normal to the plane of that
object or member which is to be separated.This technique, known from the packaging
