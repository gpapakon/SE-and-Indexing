<ABSTRACT>
A method and article for microwave bonding of thermplastic closures such as that used in splicing telecommunications wires. The article is a composite bonding material (CBM) having a thermoplastic matrix (preferably polyethylene) which is miscible with the thermoplastic material of the closure, and a plurality of microwave susceptor particles dispersed throughout the matrix. A strip is fashioned from the CBM and may be applied to the sealing edges of the closure. Upon application of microwave energy in an amount sufficient to heat the susceptors and cause both the CBM matrix and the adjacent portion of the closure to melt and flow together, a fusion bond is produced which seals the closure. If the closure is being used with a cable having an inner conductive layer or sheath, a second CBM may be used at this seal, having magnetically reactive susceptors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
methods and devices used to attach structural members, 
and more particularly to a method and article for fusion 
bonding closures such as those used to protect electrical 
splices of wiring for power or telecommunications. Cables, such as those used for telecommunications 
and power supply, often carry hundreds of pairs of 
insulated wires enclosed within flexible shields or 
tubular sheaths. When two or more cable ends are joined 
together, for example when extending a cable, tapping 
into an existing cable, or repairing a severed cable, a 
splice or splice area is created. Generally, it is 
necessary to provide a closure for such splices to 
protect the splice against harmful environmental 
influences, regardless of whether the cable is aerial or 
buried. One persistent problem in the use of splice 
closures consequently involves the need for a complete 
seal around the splice. Most prior art splice closures 
accomplish sealing by providing a complex array of nuts 
and bolts, clamps, gaskets and heat shrink 
(thermoelastic) tubing, as well as potting gels and 
resins, in various combinations. Besides the fact that 
these closure methods require significant assembly time, 
the closures still often suffer leaks or ruptures,  
 
particularly along their seals. This problem is even 
more acute at the sealing of the closure to the cable 
jacket (the outermost layer of the cable), where even the 
slightest defect can result in the migration of moisture 
along the jacket or the inner surface of the closure. 
Such moisture progresses into the splice area and 
adversely affects the electrical connections therein, 
often even when heat shrink tubing is used, since such 
tubing provides at best only a weak adhesive bond to the 
cable jacket. The use of heat shrink tubing in the 
construction of splice closures is further limited by the 
requirement for an open flame, which in many cases (e.g., 
splices in trenches or manholes) can be very dangerous 
due to the possible presence of explosive gases. Leakage at seals may be somewhat reduced by the 
use of special closure designs such as so-called 
clamshell designs which include a hinge integrally molded 
with the top and bottom halves of the closure. One such 
exemplary closure is illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 
4,810,829, which is referred to as a SLiC splice closure 
(SLiC is a trademark of Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing Co.). Nevertheless, moisture migration is 
still possible along the longitudinal seal of such
