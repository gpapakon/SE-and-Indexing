<ABSTRACT>
Electronic timepiece including a dynamic display (2) consisting of a pattern (5) composed of n discrete elements Pj which can be selectively activated by a microprocessor or a logic circuit receiving at least one signal from a time base, and making it possible at once both to prescribe the rate of increase of the number of activated elements Pj and to perform a random selection of the said activated elements, in order to reveal or mask the pattern (5) progressively during the elapsing of a time period T and/or on approaching an event E relating to the functions or functioning of the said timepiece.
