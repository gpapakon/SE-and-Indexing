<CLAIMS>
An agricultural harvesting machine (1) with a trailable transport
wagon (2) for the acceptance of harvested material (6), during the

harvesting operation of the harvesting machine (1), whereby the
transport wagon (2) has at least one arrangement for the

acceptance of the harvested material (6), characterised in that the
transport wagon (2) is constructed, apart from the harvesting

operation of the harvesting machine (1), as a transport wagon for
at least one component of the harvesting machine (1), which can

be loaded onto it, whereby the component forms part of the
harvesting machine (1) and is required by the harvesting machine

(1) during the harvesting operation, and the transport wagon (2)
has fastening elements for the detachable component of the

harvesting machine (1).
An agricultural harvesting machine according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the arrangement for the acceptance of

harvested material (6) is a conveyor mechanism for the harvested
material (6) in the region of a loading surface of the transport

wagon (2).
An agricultural harvesting machine according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the harvested material can be loaded or

stacked on at least one level of a loading surface onto the transport
wagon (2).
An agricultural harvesting machine according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the conveyor mechanism

has rollers arranged crosswise to the longitudinal axis of the
transport wagon (2), which extend over a substantial part of the

loading surface of the transport wagon (2). 
An agricultural harvesting machine according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the rollers can at, least in

part, be driven.
An agricultural harvesting machine according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the conveyor mechanism is

a scraper floor (5), which after acceptance of the harvested
material (6) can be driven intermittently and can similarly be driven

for the unloading of the harvested material (6).
An agricultural harvesting machine according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the harvesting machine (1)

is a self-propelled large baling press, that the component of the
harvesting machine is a take-up device, e.g. a pick-up for the

harvested material (6) and that the harvested material (6), for
instance straw or hay, is in formed large bales with especially a

rectangular cross section.
An agricultural harvesting machine according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that guide devices (24) are

arranged in the region of the arrangement for the acceptance of the
harvested material (6), at least in part to the sides of the transport

wagon.
An agricultural harvesting machine according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that it has a delivery

arrangement for taken up and processed harvested material (6) and
is joined to the transport wagon (2) for the acceptance of the 

harvested material (6), in a position behind the harvesting machine
(1), and a transfer mechanism is arranged between the delivery

arrangement of the harvesting machine (1) and the transport
wagon (2), which leads the harvested material (6) at least

independently of the direction of travel onto the transport wagon.
An agricultural harvesting machine according to Claim 9,
characterised in that the transfer mechanism has at least one

depositing arrangement (7) which can be turned and tilted in height
of the delivery arrangement of the harvesting machine (1).
An agricultural harvesting machine according to Claim 10,
characterised in that the depositing arrangement (7) of the

harvesting machine (1) is attached to a capturing device (21)
arranged on the transport wagon (2) so that it can at least turn,

which can be moved under power in the direction of the
longitudinal axis of the transport wagon (2).
An agricultural harvesting machine according to one of the previous
Claims 10 or 11, characterised in that the transport wagon (2) has

a guide element (24), which takes up a guide arrangement of the
depositing arrangement (7) and guides this depositing arrangement

(7) in dependency on the processing status of the large bale (6)
and/or the direction of travel of the harvesting machine (1).
An agricultural harvesting machine according to one of the previous
Claims 11 or 12, characterised in that the capturing device (21) or

the guide arrangement (24) is attached to a resetting device, which
brings the capturing device (21) or the guide arrangement (24) into

a position essentially in the longitudinal direction of the transport
wagon (2). 
An agricultural harvesting machine according to any one of the
previous Claims, with a delivery arrangement for the delivery of the

harvested material (6), whereby the transport wagon (2) serves to
accept the harvested material (6) in a position behind the

harvesting machine (1), and between the harvesting machine (1)
and the loading surface of the transport wagon (2) a transfer

mechanism is provided, which leads the harvested material (6)
independently of the direction of travel of the harvesting machine

(1) onto the transport wagon (2), and the transfer mechanism has
a depositing arrangement (7) for the harvested material (6),

whereby the depositing arrangement (7) is mounted so that it can
pivot and is directed during the transfer of the harvested material

(6) from the harvesting machine (1) into the transfer direction in
the direction of the longitudinal axis of the harvesting machine (1)

and can be moved under power into the direction of the
longitudinal axis of the transport wagon (2) during the transfer of

the harvested material (6) from the transfer mechanism onto the
loading surface of the transport wagon (2).
