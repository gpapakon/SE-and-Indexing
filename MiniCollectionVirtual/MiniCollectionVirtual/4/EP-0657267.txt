<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to molding foamable 
thermoplastic materials employing an insulated mold 

structure, in order to improve the surface quality of the 
foamed article. In an exemplary embodiment, a first 

insulation layer (26) is deposited on the core (12) and a second 
or primer layer (28) is deposited on the first layer which 

includes a suspension in metallic particles in a resin. 
A hard metal coating may be deposited over the second 

layer. Foamed thermoplastic articles formed using the 
molds have uniform surface quality, and high adhesion 

to metal coatings exhibiting good electrical 
properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to molding of thermoplastic 
materials, and more particularly, to articles useful as 
molds for foamed thermoplastic materials and methods 
for molding employing such articles. Various types of molds have long been in use for 
preparing shaped articles from thermoplastic resins, in 
such operations as blow molding, compression molding, 
injection molding and injection compression molding. 
Molds for these purposes are typically manufactured 
from metal or a similar material having high thermal 
conductivity. Blow molding involves the extrusion of a molten 
tube of resin called a parison into a mold. The mold 
closes around the parison, pinching the bottom of the 
parison closed. A gas such as air is then introduced 
causing the tube to expand against the cool surfaces of 
the mold. When the parison comes into contact with the 
cool mold surface, the plastic at the surface quickly 
freezes. This results in surface imperfections such as 
die lines, fold lines, pores and voids. In compression molding, composite blanks of glass 
reinforced thermoplastic sheets are heated. The 
material is heated above its melting point or if an 
amorphous material at least substantially above its 
glass transition temperature. When the composite 
blanks are heated, they expand (loft) due to the recoil 
forces within the fibers. The hot blanks are then 
pressed between cool mold surfaces which are below the 
melting point or glass transition temperature. Contact 
with the cool mold surfaces results in frozen resin on 
the surface of the blank. This creates unfilled areas 
in the form of exposed fibers and surface porosity.  
 
The resin at the cold surface is frozen and does not 
flow. Thus, rough boundaries between the charged and 
newly formed areas are produced. Injection molding involves injecting molten 
thermoplastic resin into a mold apparatus. Molds for 
injection molding of thermoplastic resin are usually 
made from metal material such as iron, steel, stainless 
steel, aluminum alloy or brass. Such materials are 
advantageous in that they have high thermal 
conductivity and thus allow the melt of thermoplastic 
resin to cool rapidly and shorten the molding cycle 
time. Rapid cooling, the injected resin freezes 
instantaneously at the mold surface, resulting in a 
thin solid layer which restricts the flow of the molten 
material. Rapid quenching and resulting reduced flow of the 
melt at the mold surface creates several problems, 
particularly when molding resins which contain large 
amounts of
