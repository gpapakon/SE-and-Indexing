<ABSTRACT>
A process for inerting an interior of a 
container, the process comprising: 


(a) introducing an inert fluid rich stream 
into the interior of the container, the concentration 

of inert fluid in the inert fluid rich stream 
being greater than the inert fluid concentration 

in the interior of the container; 
(b) increasing the concentration of inert 
fluid in the inert fluid rich stream during its 

introduction into the interior of the container; and 
(c) withdrawing or purging a waste gas stream 
containing at least one impurity and inert fluid from 

the interior of the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates, in general, to a 
process for inerting at least one interior of a 
container and, in particular, to a process for 
increasing the rate of inerting the interior of a 
container, especially when at least one membrane is 
used as an inert fluid source. Inert fluids, particularly inert gases, are 
useful for controlling the atmosphere of the interior 
of a container or a vessel. Of these inert fluids, 
nitrogen gas is commonly utilized for inerting, for 
example, the interior of a container which is useful 
for transporting perishable goods or manufacturing 
semiconductor chips. To supply nitrogen or other inert 
gases to the interior of a container, various inert gas 
sources have been utilized. Some of these inert gas 
sources include cylinders, liquid tanks, membrane gas 
separation plants and pressure-swing or temperature-swing 
adsorption plants. The selection of a 
particular inert gas source for a particular inerting 
process, however, is dependent on the rate of inerting 
the interior of a container and the energy (power) 
consumption associated with the inerting inasmuch as 
they play important roles in commercial operations. 
Thus, there is a need to increase the rate of inerting 
the interior of a container while reducing the power 
cost associated with the inerting process, regardless 
what inert gas sources are employed. According to the present invention, the above 
need is achieved by a phased concentration purge  
 
process for inerting an interior of a container. The 
process comprises: 
(a) steadily introducing an inert fluid rich 
stream into said interior of said container, the 
concentration of inert fluid in said inert fluid rich 
stream being greater than the inert fluid concentration 
in said interior of said container; (b) increasing the concentration of inert 
fluid in said inert fluid rich stream during its 
introduction into said container; and (c) withdrawing or purging a waste gas stream 
containing at least one impurity and inert gas from 
said interior of said container. It is desirable to introduce initially the 
inert fluid rich stream into the interior of a 
container at the highest flow rate or substantially the 
highest flow rate which can be generated by any 
compression or pumping means associated with any inert 
fluid source for introducing the inert fluid rich 
stream into the interior of the container, e.g., at 
least one compressor or pumping means associated with 
at least one membrane gas separation system which is 
useful for producing a
