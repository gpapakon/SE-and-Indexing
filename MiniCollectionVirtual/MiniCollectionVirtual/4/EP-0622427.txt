<ABSTRACT>
Use of a coating comprising an acid-functional polymer formed from 0.1% to 
20% by weight, based on the total weight of said polymer, of at least one acid-functional 

monomer and from 0.1% to 20% by weight, based on the weight of 
said acid-functional polymer, of at least one organosilane having a number 

average molecular weight of from 100 to 10,000 as at least one of the following: a 
tannin stain block, a scrub resistant, a water whitening resistant, a hot block 

resistant, a fire and smoke block, a nicotine stain block, a pen and ink stain block, 
water stain block and an adhesive improver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to use of a coating comprising an acid-functional
polymer and an organosilane.Significant research efforts have been devoted towards the development
of water-based emulsion coatings as replacements for the solvent-based coating
formulations for use in industrial and architectural applications. However,
water-based coatings have found somewhat limited acceptance in wood finishing
operations. The use of water-based coatings is generally known to those in the
coatings industry to have at least two disadvantages over solvent-based coatings:
water-soluble chromophoric compounds, such as tannin, on and in the wood
surface bleed through the applied water-based coatings to stain, discolor and
detract from the resulting finish quality; and, when applied under and exposed to
certain environmental conditions, physical properties such as scrub resistance,
water whitening resistance, corrosion resistance, hot block resistance; and fire,
smoke, nicotine, pen and ink stain blocking and adhesion of the water-based
coating to the wood substrate can be a problem.In an attempt to improve the tannin stain blocking of water-based
coatings, reactive pigments have been incorporated into the coating. Although
reactive pigments are generally effective tannin stain blocking agents, they,
however, have limitations. Reactive pigments can cause stability problems, such
as viscosity increase and polymer gelation, and are known to be environmentally
unfriendly.US-A- 5,141,784 discloses a process for treating wooden substrates having
leachable chromophoric substances by applying an effective amount of a
carboxylic acid salt and/or a water soluble organic compound bearing one or
more salt-forming amine groups and having a molecular weight of about 50 to
about 300,000.US-A- 5,051,283 discloses a surface treating composition for wooden
surfaces that inhibits leachable compositions from staining after-applied
water-base
coating comprising about 1% to about 25% by weight of an alkali metal salt
of a monobasic or dibasic carboxylic acid and about 1% to about 50% by weight of
a water soluble organic compound bearing one or more salt-forming amine 
groups and having a molecular weight of about 50 to about 300,000 and from about 25% to
about 98% water.WO 91/18954 discloses paints which contain a compound or a mixture of compounds
of' the following general formula:
X-R1[SiR2R3-O]n[SiR2(OR5)-O]m-SiR2R3-R4-Y
   wherein n is between 2 and 25, and m, between 0 to 5. X and Y represent various
functional groups, and R1, R2, R3,
