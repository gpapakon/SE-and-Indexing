Binding device having removable clips for assembling
together document sections inside a binder, of the type

comprising two plates (3, 4) fixed to the inside of the
spine (2) of the binder, and clips (9) adapted to be

assembled to said plates in order to hold the document
sections in place, each plate (3, 4) having two protruding

edges (17, 18), a bridge (5) which itself protrudes on the
inside of the spine and is upswept in a manner enabling it

to be straddled by the clips (9) once the latter have been
placed in position, and an end cheek (7, 8) designed to

prevent the clips (9) from falling out once they have been
placed in position in order to assemble the document

sections, said end cheek (7, 8) forming with the bridge
(5) a free space sufficient to allow the clips (9) to

engage beneath said bridge.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
each clip (9) has a profile in the shape of a U with two

arms of practically equal length, the inner arm (14) being
of a uniform thickness whereas the outer arm which holds

the document section in place is profiled so as to present
an inclined plane (13) adapted to facilitate the

engagement of the clip in the document section.
Device according to either of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the inner arm (14) of each clip (9)

has at its free end a protruding portion (15) which
cooperates with a tooth (19) provided on the inside wall

of the bridge (5) for the purpose of improving the
stability of the clip by preventing it from turning when

a document section is placed in the binder.
Device according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that a number of clips (9) are fixed to

small bars (11) arranged so as to protrude from a flat 
support (10) rigidly joined to the inside wall of one of

the side panels of the binder, said clips thus being made
easy to detach in order to cooperate with one of the

plates (3, 4) fixed to the spine (2) of the binder.
Device according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the plates (3, 4) are fixed to the

inside of the binder by glueing or spot welding them.
