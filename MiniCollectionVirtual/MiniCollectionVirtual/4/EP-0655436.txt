<DESCRIPTION>
Cycloalkyl and haloalkyl o-aminophenyl ketones
are utilized as starting materials in the manu-facture of
herbicidal sulfamoyl urea derivatives. The regiospecific
preparation of o-aminophenyl ketone deriva-tives is
described in US-A-4 160 784. Said patent provides a broad
inclusive method to prepare a wide variety of aromatic and
nonaromatic, substituted and unsubstituted o-aminophenyl
ketones. However, in many instances the formation of
unwanted side-products can cause decreased yields and
cumbersome product isolation procedures.DD249208 describes a process for producing 4-fluorophenyl
cyclopropyl ketone by reacting fluorobenzene with gamma-chlorobutyryl
chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride
in methylene chloride, decomposing the acylation complex
with water, removing the aqueous phase and cyclizing the 4-fluoro-gamma-chlorobutyrophenone
with aqueous alkaline in a
two-phase aqueous-organic system in the presence of a phase
transfer catalyst.The compound o-aminophenyl cyclopropyl ketone is
particularly useful in the manufacture of 1-(o-cyclopropylcarbonyl)phenylsulfamoyl
urea derivatives which are
highly potent, yet environmentally benign, cereal crop
tolerant herbicides. Methods known to prepare o-aminophenyl
cyclopropyl ketone such as those described in
US-A-4 160 784 and US-A-5 009 699 use cyclopropylnitrile as
starting material. However, cyclopropylnitrile is not
commercially nor readily obtainable, whereas 4-chlorobutyronitrile
is obtainable commercially. However,
there is no effective method available to prepare o-aminophenyl 
cyclopropyl ketone from its 4-halo acyclic
precursor, 1-(o-aminophenyl)-4-halo-1-butanone.Therefore, it is an object of this invention to
provide an improved process for the preparation of
cycloalkyl and haloalkyl o-aminophenyl ketones which gives
significantly reduced side-product formation and increased
product yield.It is a further object of this invention to
provide an effective process for the preparation of o-aminophenyl
cyclopropyl ketone via the dehydrohalogenation
of 1-(o-aminophenyl)-4-halo-1-butanone.It is a further object of this invention to
provide an economic and convenient source of starting
materials for the manufacture of herbicidal sulfamoyl urea
derivatives.The present invention provides an improved
process for the manufacture of an o-aminophenyl ketone of
formula I

wherein R is C3-C6cycloalkyl or C1-C6haloalkyl, which
comprises the following steps:
(1) reacting a nitrile of formula II
R-CN 
with borontrihalide in the presence of
an organic
solvent
