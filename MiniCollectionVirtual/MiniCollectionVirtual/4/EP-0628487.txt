<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a casing comprising a U-shaped bottom (20) nested with a lid (1) of the same shape. Stop means between these two parts are provided at the two ends of the casing. In particular, at one end where the lid extends beyond the bottom, these stop means comprise a protrusion (12) carried by a side face (3) of the lid and extending parallel with a front face (22) of the bottom. The invention also relates to a special method of making this casing.

Box comprising: 

a base that is of U-shaped cross-section having a 
lower face, a front face and a rear face, the front face 

having an opening; 
a hood that is of U-shaped cross-section having 
an upper face and two side faces and that is arranged 

to co-operate with the base in such a manner that a 
rectangular paralleliped is formed, characterised in 

that the hood (1) extends in a continuation beyond the 
front face (22) of the base (20) towards the outside of 

the box, the side faces (3, 4) having, in the vicinity of 
the front face (22) and of the rear face (23) of the 

base, stop means (12, 8) which co-operate with the latter 
faces (22, 23), the stop means (12) that co-operate with 

the front face being located on the continuation in the 
vicinity of the lower face (21) of the base and comprising 

a projection (12, 30) that extends parallel to 
the front face (22) of the base. 
Box according to claim 1 in which each side face (3, 
4) of the hood has, along one free edge along the lower 

face (21) of the base, a flange (11) that extends 
perpendicularly towards the other side face, the projection 

comprising a cylinder (12) that extends perpendicularly 
to the flange in the direction of the upper 

face (2) of the hood. 
Box according to claim 2 in which the cylinder is 
hollow and is formed by an eyelet in the flange (11) that 

carries the cylinder.  
 
Box according to any one of the preceding claims 
in which the stop means that co-operate with the rear 

face (23) of the base comprise a flange (8) that is 
carried by an edge of each side face (3, 4) of the hood 

and runs along the rear face (23), which flange (8) 
extends perpendicularly to the side face in the direction 

of the other side face. 
Box according to any one of claims 1 to 3, in which 
the hood (1) extends in a continuation beyond the front 

face (22) and the rear face (23) of the base, the stop 
means associated with those two faces being located on 

the continuation and comprising the projection (12, 30). 
Box according to any one of the preceding claims, 
in which the upper face (2) of the hood has, along the 

two free edges along the front face (22) and the rear 
face (23) of the base, a perpendicular flange (5) that 

extends towards the lower face (21) of the base, and the 
front face (22) and the rear face (23) of the base each 

have, along an edge along the upper face (2) of the hood, 
a flange (40) that extends perpendicularly towards the 

outside of the box until it meets the flange (5) of the 
hood. 
Method for assembling a box according to any one of 
the preceding claims, the base (20) having on each free 

edge of each of its faces a perpendicular flange (25) 
that is oriented in such a manner that it is able to be 

positioned against a corresponding face of the hood, 
which method is characterised by the following steps: 


applying a strip of adhesive on one face of each 
of the flanges (25) of the base, which face is to be 

positioned against the hood; 
altering resiliently the shape of the hood (1) by 
pivoting its side faces (3, 4) outwards about an edge of  

 
those side faces, by which edge the side faces are joined 

to the upper face (2) of the hood, and maintaining the 
hood in that state; 
placing the base (20) inside the hood (1); and 
releasing the side faces of the hood so that they 
are positioned by resilience against the flanges (25) of 

the base, which flanges have been provided with adhesive.
