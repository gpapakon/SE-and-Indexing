<ABSTRACT>
A pin-type synchronizer mechanism (86) with self-energizing 
ramps is configured to provide self-energizing forces for reducing an operator 

applied shift force (F
o
) and/or shift time. The self-energizing forces are 
provided by self-energizing ramp surfaces (29e,29f,29g,29h) and 

(111a,111b,111c,111d) respectively, formed in external splines (29) of a 
shaft 28 and in internal teeth (111) extending radially inward from a shift 

flange (110). The ramp surfaces provide an additive axial force (F
a
) applied 
to friction rings (114,116) via shift flange blocker surfaces (110d,110e) 

reacting respectively against pin blocker surfaces (118c,118d). The shift 
flange carries improved pre-energizer and neutral position centering 

assemblies (120) including pre-energizer plungers (124) and neutral position 
plungers (126) respectively for axially retaining pins (118) and friction rings 

(114,116) in a neutral position relative to flange (110) and for neutral 
positioning flange (110) relative to recesses (128) in shaft (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pin-type synchronizer mechanism employed in 
a multi-ratio transmission. Additionally, the invention relates to synchronizer 
mechanisms of the self-energizing type. Pin-type synchronizer mechanisms for use in multi-ratio 
transmissions are well known. Such mechanisms include friction and jaw 
members for respectively synchronizing and positive clutching a gear to a shaft, 
a plurality of pins rigidly extending from at least one friction member and 
through openings in a radially extending shift flange, pre-energizer assemblies 
for engaging the friction members in response to initial engaging movement of 
the flange, and blockers defined by shoulders on the pins and about the flange 
openings for preventing asynchronous engagement of the jaw members. It is also known in the multiple ratio transmission art that 
synchronizer mechanisms may be used to reduce shift time of all or some of 
the transmission gear ratios. It is also known that the shift effort required by 
a vehicle operator, i.e., force applied to a shift lever, may be reduced by use 
of synchronizer mechanisms of the self-energizing type. Since operator shift 
effort generally increases with vehicle size and weight, synchronizer 
mechanisms of the self-energizing type are especially important for heavy duty 
trucks. U.S. Patent 5,092,439, discloses a pin-type synchronizer of the 
self-energizing type. An object of this invention is to improve neutral positioning of a 
pin-type synchronizer mechanism. Another object of this invention is to improve neutral positioning 
of a pin-type synchronizer mechanism having self-energizing means. According to this invention, a pin-type synchronizer 
mechanism for first and second axially spaced apart gears is mounted for  
 
rotation and secured against axial movement on a shaft means having an axis 
about which the gears and the shaft means rotate. The synchronizer mechanism, as disclosed in US-A-5 092 439 and which represents the pre-charactering portion referred to in claim 1, includes 
gear friction and gear jaw means affixed to each gear. The gear friction means 
is engagable with first and second axially spaced apart and axially movable 
friction means for respectively synchronizing the first and second gears with the 
shaft means. The gear jaw means is engagable with axially movable jaw means 
of an assembly which includes a flange extending radially between the first and 
second friction means and means axially connecting the flange to the axially 
movable jaw means.
