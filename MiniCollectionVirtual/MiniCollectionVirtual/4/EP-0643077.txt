can bind to CD28, CTLA-4 and is located on the activated B 

cell surface, i.e. B70, and its functional fragments are 
provided. A hybridoma which can produce the monoclonal 

antibody and a method for the production of a monoclonal 
antibody by using said hybridoma are also provided. The 

monoclonal antibody of this invention is useful for the 
study of the analysis of T-B cell interaction and for the 

clinical treatment including immunotherapy in 
transplantation, diagnosis of autoimmune diseases or the 

like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a monoclonal antibody 
and its functional fragments, more particularly a 
monoclonal antibody which reacts specifically with B70 
which is expressed on the surface of an activated B cell 
membrane, or its functional fragments, a method for 
producing the monoclonal antibody, and a hybridoma being 
capable of producing the monoclonal antibody. The 
monoclonal antibody of this invention is useful for the 
immunotherapy or diagnosis for rejection in 
transplantation, autoimmune diseases, allergic diseases, 
cancers, etc. The "functional fragment" of the monoclonal 
antibody means fragments of the antibody which have an 
antigen-antibody reactivity, and includes specifically 
F(ab')â‚‚, Fab', Fab, Fv, recombinant Fv and single chain Fv. Immune response happens based on the mechanism of 
complicated and interaction of various kinds of cells and 
regulatory factors. It is the same in the case of the 
interaction of T cell and B cell. The main immune response 
of T cell and B cell is recognized via the binding of an 
antigen/MHC class II complex expressed on the surface of B 
cell with a T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex on the  
 
surface of T cell. However, the TCR and the antigen/MHC 
complex has not high affinity, and the adhesion of between 
T cell-B cell is effected by using various kinds of 
molecules and submolecules, for example, LFA-1 and ICAM-1, 
ICAM-2, ICAM-3; CD2 and LFA-3; CD48; CD4 or CD 8 and MHC 
class I, II; etc., which are expressed in T cell and B 
cell, respectively. These molecules exhibit widely their 
functions not only in the interaction of T-B cells but also 
in the adhesion between leukocytes and target cells, 
tissues and blood tube endothelium, and the like. It is 
very important to clarify the functions of these adhesion 
molecules not only for the study of immunology but also for 
clinical study. It has recently been clarified that a molecule 
which has been considered to be a differential antigen 
specific to T cell or B cell, as well as the above 
molecules, play an important role in the interaction of T-B 
cells. Those cells include CD28-B7/BB1 system. CD28 is a 
homodimer having a 90 kd which can be expressed in the 
peripheral T cell surface membrane, and B7/BB1 are a 
membrane molecule of an immunoglobulin superfamily, which 
are expressed in an activated B cell or macrophage which 
are antigen-presenting cells, dendric cells, and the like. 
The mechanism of the reaction between T-B cells, to which 
adhesion molecules participate, is illustrated
