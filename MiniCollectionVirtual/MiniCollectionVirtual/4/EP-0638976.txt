<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sleeve end for a cable sleeve (1) having a sealing insert made of elastic material and having elements which produce pressure, preferably by means of screws (18), in order to compress the sealing insert (2). The cable sleeve (1) is expanded in the form of a cone in the entry region into which an initially matched, conical sealing insert (2) is inserted. After insertion of the cables (45), pressure is exerted in the axial direction on the sealing insert (2), by means of the elements (18) which produce pressure. The conical design on the circumference of the cable sleeve results in radial compression of the elastic material of the sealing insert (2), which results in the sealing. Cable trapping devices (28, 49, 41, 46), which are aligned with the cable entry openings (3, 13), are provided in the interior of the cable sleeve.
