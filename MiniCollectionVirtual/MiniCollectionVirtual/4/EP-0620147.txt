<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic cylinder is of a double piston rod type, in which a piston rod reciprocates in response to pressures of hydraulic 
fluid in a pair of pressure chambers, and which is used as, for example, an axle cylinder for industrial vehicles having a hydraulic 

power steering. The subject of the invention is the provision of a hydraulic cylinder, of which production cost is held low and 
which can enhance durability by protecting a piston rod from scratches and abrasion upon sliding. Interposed between a piston 

rod (14) and respective rod guides (12, 13) is a bush (37) which permits sliding of the piston rod (14). Formed on the inner peripheral 
surfaces of the respective rod guides (12, 13) are oil grooves (35, 36) for constituting oil passages (23, 26) which allows 

communication between oil passing ports (21, 24) and pressure chambers (18, 19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a double piston rod type 
hydraulic cylinder in which piston rods, provided in a pair 
of compression chambers, reciprocate due to varying hydraulic 
fluid pressures in both compression chambers. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a hydraulic cylinder 
suitable for an axle cylinder used with industrial vehicles 
having a hydraulic power steering system. Industrial vehicles, such as fork lift trucks, are typically 
driven in a reverse direction and frequently make tight turns. 
The conventional steering mechanism of such vehicles utilize 
the vehicle's rear wheels for turning the vehicle in a left 
or right direction and oftentimes incorporate hydraulic power 
steering to reduce the effort required by the driver to steer 
the vehicle. In particular such systems utilize a hydraulic 
rear axle cylinder. Fig. 5 illustrates a rear axle cylinder 51 that has a 
hydraulic fluid filled cylinder tube 52 having gray cast iron 
rod guides 53 and 54 attached at both ends. A piston rod 55,  
 
supported by rod guides 53 and 54 in the cylinder tube 52, 
reciprocates in a rightward and leftward direction. Both end 
portions of the piston rod 55 are coupled to the vehicle's 
roar wheels via tie rods, knuckles or the like (not shown). 
Upon movement of the piston rod 55 leftward, the piston's 
motion is converted to the tilting motion of the rear wheels 
via the tie rode, knuckles, etc. Compression chambers 57 and 58 are defined in the cylinder 
tube 52 by a piston 56 mounted on the outer surface of the 
piston rod 55. An oil inlet port 59 formed in the left rod 
guide 53 is connected to a hydraulic pump via a piping 60, and 
to the compression chamber 57 via an oil passage 61. 
Likewise, an oil inlet port 62, formed in the right rod guide 
54, is connected to the hydraulic pump via a piping 63 and to 
the compression chamber 58 via an oil passage 64. When the 
hydraulic pump supplies hydraulic fluid to the compression 
chamber 57 via the combination of the piping 60, the oil inlet 
port 59 and the oil passage 61, the hydraulic fluid in the 
compression chamber 58 is discharged via the oil passage 64, 
the oil inlet port 62 and the piping 63. This causes the 
rightward movement of the piston rod 55. Each of the oil passages 61 and 64 is formed having a vertical 
hole 65, an oblique hole 66 and an annular groove 67. The 
vertical hole 65 extends inward in the radial direction of the 
rod guide 53 or 54 from the oil inlet port 59 or 62. The  
 
annular groove 67 is formed entirely
