<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an electrostatic image developer with negative 
chargeability which can give clear image quality and high 

image density by virtue of the toner, contained therein, 
having a small-diameter or a high content of fine toner 

particle, surface-modified with a fluoropolymer fine 
particle. The toner primarily consists of a polyester 

binder resin and a coloring pigment, and the toner has an 
average particle size of 9 µm or less, or a ≦ 4 µm fine 

toner particle content of at least 0.1 % by weight. The 
toner is surface-modified with 0.1 to 10 % by weight of a 

fluoropolymer fine particle having an average particle size 
smaller than that of the toner, in such a way that the 

ratio of the surface area of the fluoropolymer fine 
particle to that of the toner may be 10⁻³ to 10⁻¹. Use of a 

polytetrafluoroethylene fine particle is preferred among 
other fluoropolymers, and a combination of the surface 

modification with the fluoropolymer fine particle and that 
with an inorganic fine particle is further preferred.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrostatic image developer
used for developing latent electrostatic images in
electrophotography, electrostatic recording, electrostatic
printing, etc. More particularly, this invention relates
to an electrostatic image developer with negative
chargeability which can give clear image quality and high
image density in spite of its small-diameter and the high
content of fine toner particles.There are well-known conventional developments of latent
electrostatic image, and, for example in
electrophotography, a uniformly charged photoconductor
layer consisting of selenium, zinc oxide, a vinyl carbazole
compound, cadmium sulfide, a phthalocyanine compound, etc.
is subjected to light exposure with the same light image as
depicted on a master drawing to extinguish the
electrostatic charge on the exposed portions of the
photoconductor to obtain a latent electrostatic image, on
which a toner consisting of a binder resin, a coloring
pigment and other additives is electrostatically deposited
to form a toner image. The thus formed toner image is, as
necessary, transferred to an image support such as paper,
and then the toner thus transferred is fused by heating,
softened or dissolved with a solvent or deformed by
application of pressure to be permanently fixed onto the
image support.While various processes such as cascade development, powder
cloud development, magnetic brush development, jumping
development and touch down development are well known as
the methods of latent electrostatic image development, the 
electrostatic image developers are roughly classified into
two-component developer and single-component developer.
The two-component developer consists of a toner and a
carrier such as iron powders, steel beads, ferrites and
glass beads, having a particle size larger than that of the
toner, and the latent electrostatic image is developed by
the toner charged through friction with the carrier. The
single-component developers are further classified into
magnetic single-component developers each of which consists
of a toner and a magnetic substance such as triiron
tetroxide, diiron trioxide and ferrite and forms a toner
layer on a developer carrying member with the aid of the
magnetic force and develops the latent electrostatic image;
and nonmagnetic single-component developers which develop
latent electrostatic images formed by the toner layer on
developer carrying member by means of contact on
electrification, triboelectrification, etc.As such a toner, small particles prepared by
