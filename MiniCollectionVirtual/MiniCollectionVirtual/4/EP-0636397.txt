<ABSTRACT>
A filter element has a support plate (10) with a mounting groove (24) which runs round a filter chamber recess (12). A fitted filter cloth (28) which covers said recess (12) has an integrally moulded mounting frame (26) which is seated in the mounting groove (24). Thus the filter cloth can be installed on the supporting plate (10) simply, rapidly and without folds or creases, and a barrier to the passage of liquid is obtained at the edge of the fitted filter cloth (28).

<CLAIMS>
Filter element for a chamber filter or diaphragm filter, 
having an essentially rigid, plate-shaped carrying body (10) 

in which apertures (14, 16, 18) for feeding in medium to be 
filtered and for conducting away filtrate are provided, having 

a flexible filter medium blank (28) and having fastening means 
for the detachable fitting of the filter medium blank (28) to 

the carrying body (10), characterized in that the fastening 
means have: a mounting frame (26) which is cast, injection-moulded, 

glued or heat-sealed onto the edge of the filter 
medium blank (28), and also a circumferential mounting groove 

(24) which is provided on the carrying body (10) and is 
adapted, in shape and cross-section, to the mounting frame 

(26). 
Filter element according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the mounting frame (26) consists of elastically yielding 

material, for example a synthetic elastomeric material having 
a Shore hardness of about 70Â°. 
Filter element according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the mounting frame (26) is produced from essentially rigid, 

elastic material. 
Filter element according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the mounting frame (26) is subdivided, by at least one 

elongated slot (32) provided in a holding section (34), into 
at least two arms which can be moved elastically in relation 

to one another. 
Filter element according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the mounting groove (24) is undercut.  

 
Filter element according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the mounting groove (24) and the 

mounting frame (26) have torque-absorbing wall faces (40). 
Filter element according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the mounting frame (26) consists of a 

material which is selected from the following group: 
polyurethane, silicon, epoxy resin, PP, PAN, PA, PES, PE, PVC, 

PVDF, PPS, PVDCL, PTFE, ceramics. 
Filter element according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the filter medium blank (28) consists of 

a material which is selected from the following group: woven 
fabrics, non-woven fabrics or needle felts made from 

monofilament, multifilament or staple fibres and combinations 
thereof, the fibrous material consisting of PP, PAN, PA, PES, 

PE, PVDF, PPS, PVDCL, PEEK, PFTE, aramite, glass, high-grade 
steel, or ceramics. 
Process for manufacturing a filter element according to one 
of claims 1 to 8, characterized by the following process 

steps: 

a) the mounting groove (24) is filled with a hardenable 
frame material until the latter protrudes above its 

exposed edges; 
b) the filter medium blank (28) is placed on the frame 
material applied. 
c) that strip of the filter medium blank (28) which lies on 
the frame material and is to be embedded, is thrust 

forward against the hardenable frame material, strip-shaped 
sections of the filter medium blank (28) which 

adjoin the strip to be embedded being firmly pressed 
against the upper face of the carrying body (10), for 

example using a squeezing roller or squeezing frame. 
Process for manufacturing a filter element according to 
one of claims 1 to 8, characterized by the following process 

steps: 

a) the filter medium blank (28) is temporarily fastened to 
the carrier plate (10) in the upper section, for example 

using adhesive strips; 
b) plastics material, which can be progressively hardened in 
the peripheral direction, is poured into the mounting 

groove (24) in the carrying body (10) and, essentially at 
the same time, hardenable frame material is applied to 

the aligning section of the outside of the filter medium 
blank (28). 
Process according to claim 10, characterized in that the 
application of frame material is carried out using a 

discharging head (50) which has a first discharging piece (52) 
which engages in the mounting groove (24), and a second 

discharging piece (60) which can be moved in conjunction with 
the said first discharging piece and engages over the edge of 

the filter medium blank (28). 
Process according to claim 11, characterized in that a 
holding-down device (64), which cooperates with the filter 

medium blank (28), is moved in conjunction with the 
discharging head (50).
