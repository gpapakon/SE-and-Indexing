<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for separating pieces (2), from a cardboard track (1) having transverse perforations (3), and being fed through a device incorporating two pairs of individually driven rollers (8, 9 and 12, 13 resp.) arranged one pair after the other in the feed direction, which rollers of each pair of rollers between themselves form a through-feed space through which the cardboard track is fed, and where separation is effected in that the second pair of rollers (12, 13) is caused to feed the cardboard track at a higher speed than the first pair of rollers (8, 9), whereby the presence of a perforation (3) in the cardboard track (1) between the two pairs of rollers (8, 9 and 12, 13 resp.) is detected, the rotation of the second pair of rollers (12, 13) at such presence being reversed, in order to feed with both pairs of rollers the cardboard track between the pairs of rollers towards the perforation (3) situated between the pairs of rollers, thereby forcing the cardboard track to bend upwards, whereby the fibres of the cardboard track are broken, and thereupon again reversing the rotation of the second pair of rollers (12, 13) and driving these at a rotational relative speed higher than that of the first pair of rollers (8, 9) for causing severing of the cardboard track at the perforation.

<DESCRIPTION>
A METHOD AND A DEVICE FOR SEPARATION OF PIECES FROM A PERFO¬ RATED CARDBOARD TRACKBackground of the inventionThe present invention refers to a method for separating of pieces, such as tickets, lottery tickets or the like from a perforated cardboard track, and a device for accomplishing the method.Such a device is preferably part of a vending machine for different types of tickets, lottery tickets or the like, where insertion of a coin or a token in the vending machine results in discharge of a ticket, a lottery ticket or the like which has been separated from the track. However, the use of the device is not limited to such vending machines. The cardboard track is provided with subsequent fields of printings and with a perforation perpendicular to the longi¬ tudinal direction of the cardboard track provided between each pair of subsequent fields, and the continuous track of fields with intermediate perforations is folded in zig-zag manner in the same manner as a data print-out.For advancing and separating such pieces from a cardboard track, e.g. US-A-3,672,551 has earlier proposed a separation machine for paper material in track-form with transverse lines of weakening, whereby the track is allowed to pass between a pair of infeed rollers, which are driven at one speed, whereupon the track is pulled in between a pair of outfeed rollers, which are driven at a higher relative speed, the speed difference thereby being so chosen that a piece of the track is severed by the outfeed rollers in that the material weakening is caused to burst due to the higher speed of the outfeed rollers. Such a separation of the material functions rather well, but at least at materials which are not all too thin, such as carton or cardboard, it is required quite big power to bring about the separation, 

 which is effected solely by means of a pulling force in the longitudinal direction of the track.Purpose and most important features of the inventionThe purpose of the present invention is to provide a method and a device for accomplishing the method, by means of which separation of pieces, also from rather thick cardboard tracks, can be effected at a substantially lower power requirement as compared to earlier methods and devices, and this has been obtained by the features defined in the cha¬ racterizing part of claim 1 and claim 5 resp..Description of the drawingsHereinafter the invention will be further described with reference to an embodiment shown in the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 shows in perspective and schematically a

 CLAIMS
1. A method for separating pieces (2) from a cardboard track (1) having transverse perforations (3), which track is fed through a device incorporating two pairs of individually driven rollers (8,9 and 12,13 resp.) arranged one pair after the other in the feed direction, which rollers of each pair of rollers between themselves form a through-feed space through which the cardboard track is fed, and where separa- tion is effected in that the second pair of rollers (12,13) is caused to feed the cardboard track at a higher speed than the first pair of rollers (8,9), c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n detecting the presence of a perforation (3) in the cardboard track (1) between the two pairs of rollers (8,9 and 12,13 resp. ), reversing the rotation of the second pair of rollers (12,13) at such presence, in order to feed with both pairs of rol¬ lers the cardboard track between the pairs of rollers to- wards the perforation (3) situated between the pairs of rollers thereby forcing the cardboard track to fold upwards, whereby the fibres of the cardboard track are broken, reversing thereupon the rotation of the second pair of rollers (12,13) again and driving these at a rotational relative speed, higher than that of the first pair of rol¬ lers (8,9) for causing severing of the cardboard track at the perforation.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n driving the first pair of rollers (8,9) in reversed rotatio¬ nal direction after folding of the cardboard track (1) between the two pairs of rollers (8,9 and 12,13 resp.) in order to stretch the cardboard track about the folded perfo- ration (3) before the second pair of rollers (12,13) are operated to cause severing of the cardboard track. 


3. A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d t h e r e i n that the rotation for the first pair of rollers (8,9) is stopped before effecting the severing of the cardboard track.
4. A method as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n providing the cardboard track (1) with a fractural impres- sion in a portion of the folded perforation (3) prior to separation.
5. A method as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 4, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n subjecting the cardboard track (1) to a pre-cracking at a position in front of the first pair of rollers (8,9).
6. A device for separation of pieces (2) from a cardboard track (1) having transverse perforations (3), which track is fed through a device incorporating two pairs of individually driven rollers (8,9 and 12,13 resp.) arranged one pair after the other in the feed direction, which rollers of each pair of rollers between themselves form a through-fee space through which the cardboard track is fed, and where separa- tion is effected in that the second pair of rollers (12,13) is caused to feed the cardboard track at a higher speed than the first pair of rollers (8,9), in accordance with the method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d t h e r e i n that means (16) are provided for detecting presence of a perforation (3) between the two pairs of rollers (8,9 and 12,13 resp.), and that the second pair of rollers (12,13) is reversible and adapted to be driven in a backward direction at detection of a perforation between the pairs of rollers. 


 7. A device according to claim 6, c h a r a c t e r i z e d t h e r e i n that the detection means is a photocell (16) arranged after the second pair of rollers (12,13) at a distance from the middle line between the two pairs of rollers, which distance corresponds to the distance between two subsequent perfora¬ tions (3) in the cardboard track (1).
8. A device as claimed in anyone of claims 6 or 7, c h a r a c t e r i z e d t h e r e i n that a knife (7) is provided in the area just between the two pairs of rollers, said knife being adapted to give the cardboard track (1) a f actural impression in a portion of the perforation situated between the pairs of rollers.
9. A device as claimed in anyone of claims 6 to 8 , c h a r a c t e r i z e d t h e r e i n that a deflection roller (7) is provided in the path of the cardboard track (1) before its infeed between the rollers (8,9) of the first pair of rollers, which deflection roller is arranged to give the cardboard track a pre-cracking as it passes the deflection roller.
