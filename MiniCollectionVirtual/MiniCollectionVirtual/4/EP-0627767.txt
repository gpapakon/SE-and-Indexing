<ABSTRACT>
A unified process flow for the fabrication of an isolated 
vertical PNP (VPNP) transistor, a junction field effect 

transistor (JFET) and a metal/nitride/polysilicon capacitor 
includes the simultaneous fabrication of deep junction 

isolation regions (36, 121) and a VPNP buried collector 
(28). Junction isolation is completed by the doping and 

diffusion of shallow junction isolation regions (46, 122) at 
the same time that deep collector regions (48) are formed. A 

JFET source region (74) and a drain region (76) are formed 

simultaneously with a VPNP emitter region (70). A JFET gate 
contact region (88) is formed simultaneously with a VPNP 

base contact region (84), a VPNP buried region contact (86) 
and optionally with the doping of a capacitor electrode 

(124).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the
fabrication of different integrated circuit devices using
a single semiconductor substrate, and more particularly to
a process for simultaneously fabricating
a junction field effect transistor
(JFET) and a capacitor. Operational amplifier designs have always been
limited in that conventional PNP integrated circuit
transistors used therefor can operate only to around 5
megahertz. These PNP transistors in combination with
conventional NPN transistors are typical devices found in
operational amplifier integrated circuits.Recently, a high-frequency isolated vertical PNP
(VPNP) transistor has been developed that is superior to
the conventional and substrate PNP transistors. This
isolated VPNP transistor is capable of 45-volt operation
and exhibits a maximum operating frequency around 150
megahertz. The current gain and breakdown voltages on the
isolated VPNP transistor are comparable to those achieved
on the standard double diffused NPN transistor. Finally,
the isolated VPNP is not limited to the emitter-follower
configuration taken by the normal vertical substrate PNP
transistor.Separately, a 50-volt (p) channel JFET has been
developed to extend the gate-to-drain breakdown voltage
past 45 volts. JFETs of this kind are conventionally used
as operational amplifier inputs. These JFETs are achieved
by using a thick deposited oxide over the gate oxide to
reduce the electric field intensification at the top
gate/drain reverse-biased p-n junction. This increases
the gate-to-drain breakdown voltage from the low 30 volt
range to approximately 50 volts. The gate-to-drain and
gate-to-source oxides overlap capacitances are also
reduced with the deposited oxide. This contributes to
higher bandwidths and slew rates. Another desirable integrated circuit component
is the metal/nitride/poly capacitor. The use of nitride
in the place of oxide provides a doubling of the
capacitance and allows for a dielectric breakdown in
excess of 100 volts, and the fabrication of these
capacitors on field oxide reduces parasitic junction
capacitance and tank leakage currents.From Elektrotechnik und Maschinenbau, vol. 85, no. 10, 1968,
pgs. 461-465, a monolithic integrated circuit including an
NPN transistor, an (n) channel junction field effect
transistor, a resistor and a capacitor formed within an (n)
type layer on a (p) type substrate is known. The layers of
the circuit are formed by diffusing dopants of different
conductivity types into the silicon substrate. Heavily (p)

A process for fabricating a junction field effect
transistor (JFET) and a capacitor using a single

semiconductor substrate of a first conductivity type,
comprising the steps of:


forming a buried region (16) of a first conductivity
type at a face of the semiconductor substrate (10);
simultaneously forming at least two deep junction
isolation regions at the face to be of the first

conductivity type, the first deep junction isolation region
(36) formed between a JFET area (19) of the substrate (10)

and a capacitor area of the substrate (10), the second
junction isolation region (121) formed within the capacitor

area;
forming an epitaxial layer (38) of the second
conductivity type on the face;
forming an insulator layer (40) on an outer face of the
epitaxial layer (38);
up-diffusing dopant to extend the buried region (16)
and the deep junction isolation regions (36, 121) into the

epitaxial layer (38);
simultaneously forming at least two shallow junction
isolation regions of the first conductivity type at the

outer face of the epitaxial layer (38), each shallow
junction isolation region formed to be continuous with a

respective deep junction isolation region (36, 121); 
forming a polycrystalline layer including silicon on
the insulator layer (40) over the second shallow junction

isolation region;
forming a middle-level insulating layer over the
polycrystalline layer and the insulating layer (40);
opening orifices in the middle-level insulating
layer to the polycrystalline layer and to a region of the

insulating layer over a gate contact region (88) of the
epitaxial layer (38) in the JFET area (19);
removing the region of the insulating layer to expose
the gate contact region (88); and
simultaneously doping the polycrystalline layer and
the gate contact region to respectively form a conductive

capacitor electrode (124) and a top gate contact.
The process of claim 1, wnerein said insulator layer (40)
comprises silicon dioxide, the process comprising the

further step of thermally growing at least a portion of the
insulator layer (40) during said step of up-diffusing

dopant.
