<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for igniting and operating a
high-pressure discharge lamp, provided with
switching means, inductive means and rectifying means together forming a Buck
converter, connected to input terminals for connection to a supply source and output
terminals for connection of the lamp, comprising means for supplying the lamp with a
current through periodic switching of the switching means alternately into a conducting and a
non-conducting state by means of a switch-on and switch-off signal, respectively,which inductive means comprise a primary and a secondary winding, the
secondary winding forming part of an integration network for generating the switch-off
signal.A circuit arrangement of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is
known from EP-A-0 401 931 = USP 5,068,572. The known circuit arrangement is highly
suitable for igniting and operating a high-pressure discharge lamp which forms part of a
projection TV installation.The type of switch mode power supply known as Buck converter is also
known under other designations such as downconverter, step-downconverter, inductor-coupled
step-downconverter and direct-downconverter. An electrical separation in the form of
a transformer may be present between input terminals and output terminals.The Buck converter operates in a self-oscillatory mode in the known
circuit arrangement.It is possible with the known circuit arrangements to supply a substantially
constant power to the connected lamp over a comparatively wide current and voltage range,
so that a very constant luminous flux is generated by the lamp. The self-oscillatory mode is
characterized by low switching losses in the periodic switching of the switching means,
especially in the current-voltage range where lamp operation is stable. Preferably, the
downconverter is so dimensioned that switching from the non-conducting to the conducting
state takes place with a frequency above the limit of human hearing during stable lamp 
operation. This also has the result that the dimensions of the inductive means can remain
comparatively small.For generating the switch-off signal, a comparison is made in the known
circuit arrangement between a separately set control signal and a signal prevalent at an output
of the integration network and proportional to the value of the current through the inductive
means. The moment the signal at the output of the integration network becomes equal to the
separately set control signal, the switch-off signal is generated, whereupon the
