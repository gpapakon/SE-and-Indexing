<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dermatological 
and cosmetic compositions and particularly to 
compositions having antiageing activity; said 
compositions are also useful in the treatment of burns, 
wounds and are characterized by a high stability such 
as to make them also suitable for the stabilization of 
active ingredients. 
The British Patent Application GB-A-2 143 841 deals with 
the stability problem of thickened aqueous surfactant compositions 
for use as shaving creams and liquid soap formulations.  
 Skin is formed by cells whose state affects the 
external appearance of epidermis. Skin ageing derives 
from a slowing of the derm functions, particularly 
nutrition, respiration, hydration, regeneration and 
cutaneous tissues protection. Skin ageing is a natural 
phenomenon whose causes are of different origin and can 
be more or less fast for each person. Generally, the 
function slowing of certain cells, whose role is very 
important in maintaining the integrity of derm 
structure, begins around one's thirties. This 
phenomenon may begin at a more or less early age, due 
to many factors, such as genetic set, general health 
state, each individual's peculiar way of life. The object of the present invention are 
dermatological and cosmetic compositions having 
antiageing activity and having high stability, also in 
the presence of active ingredients of various kind. The compositions according to the invention 
consist of: 
1) emulsifying and self-emulsifying agents, having o/w activity formed by a mixture containing (as % w/w) 1') polyethylene glycol mono- or distearate0.5-5.0 %  
 2') polyglycol esters of saturated or unsaturated C₁₄-C₂₀ fatty acids1.0-10.0 % 3') cetyl alcohol and optionally other higher alcohols, comprising free or esterified sterols1.0-16.0 % 2) sodium versenate and antioxidant agents0.1-5.0 % 3) anti-mould and bacteriostatic agents0.05-0.1 % 4) active ingredients1-30 % 5) purified water F.U.q.s. to 100 % Polyethylene glycols, having various molecular 
weight, for example ranging from 200 to 10,000, 
preferably from 400 to 2,000, more preferably 1,000, 
can be used. Polyethylene glycol 1,000 monostearate is 
particularly preferred. The antioxidant agents are selected from the group 
consisting of: 
a) polyunsaturated fatty acids, preferably belonging 
to vitamin F group; b) tocopheryl derivatives, preferably tocopheryl 
acetate. Examples of anti-mould and/or bacteriostatic 
agents are methyl or propyl p-oxybenzoates. The active ingredients preferably have derm 
reconstituting
