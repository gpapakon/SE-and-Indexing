<ABSTRACT>
A parallel movement mould mechanism for use in a 
glassware forming machine comprises mould supports (2,10) 

mounted for movement on horizontal shafts (6,14) and means 
for moving the mould supports comprising a cage assembly 

(24) in which a piston and cylinder device (38) linked to 
the mould supports is mounted, the cage assembly (24) being 

mounted for adjustable pivotal movement with respect to 
shafts so that adjustment of the position of the cage 

assembly adjusts the position of the centre line of moulds 
supported on the mould supports.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with mould mechanisms for 
use in glassware forming machines. A common type of glassware forming machine is the 
so-called 'individual section' or I.S. machine which 
comprises a bank of separate sections which are caused to 
operate in staggered time relationship one with another so 
that each section in turn produces glassware. I.S. machines 
comprising 10, 12 or even more sections are now common 
place. Problems arise in the operation of such machines if one 
of the mechanisms breaks down, as a major repair of the 
mechanism will entail removal of the section in question 
from the machine and replacement by another section, which 
is a lengthy and time consuming operation. Major repair 
work can be more simply and quickly carried out if the 
mechanism in question can be readily removed from the 
section as a unit, and replaced by a substitute unit while 
the defective unit is being repaired. In such circumstances 
it is desirable that the replacement unit shall be readily 
adjustable to ensure that its operating parts are precisely 
aligned with the remaining mechanisms in the section. A section of an I.S. machine normally contains two sets 
of moulds, a set comprising one, two, three or four pairs of 
mould halves, one set being adapted for forming a group of 
parisons from gobs of molten glass delivered to the machine, 
the other set being adapted for forming a group of blown 
containers from the parisons. It will be realized that it 
is essential that a replacement mould mechanism should have 
the facility to ensure that its set of moulds is correctly 
aligned with the remaining mechanisms of the machine. It is one of the objects of the present invention to 
provide a mould opening and closing mechanism which can be 
readily adjusted.  
 The present invention provides a 
mould mechanism for a glassware forming machine comprising 
   a frame member, 
   a first and a second mould support mounted for linear 
movement towards and away from each other to bring moulds 
supported on the mould supports between a closed and an open 
position, each mould support being mounted for sliding 
movement on a horizontal shaft supported in the frame member, and 
   means for moving the mould supports between such open 
and closed positions, known e.g. from EP-A2-0 373 769, which is, 
according to the invention, 
   characterized in that 
   the means for moving the mould supports between such 
open and closed positions comprises a cage assembly 
pivotally supported in the frame member
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mould mechanism for a glassware forming machine 
comprising
 
   a frame member (8),
 
   a first and a second mould support (2,10) mounted for 

linear movement towards and away from each other to bring 
moulds (18) supported on the mould supports between a closed 

and an open position, each mould support being mounted for 
sliding movement on a horizontal shaft (6,14) supported in 

the frame member, and
 
   means for moving the mould supports (2,10) between such 

open and closed positions,
 
   characterized in that
 
   the means for moving the mould supports between such 

open and closed positions comprises a cage assembly (24) 
pivotally supported in the frame member about an axis (22) 

parallel to the centre line of the moulds,
 
   a piston and cylinder device (38) mounted in the cage 

assembly (24),
 
   links (56,58) connecting each mould support with the 

piston and cylinder device (38) so that on operation of the 
piston and cylinder device the mould supports are moved 

between their open and their closed positions and
 
   means for adjusting the position of the cage assembly 

(24) about the pivotal support (22) whereby to adjust the 
position of the centre line of the moulds with respect to 

the frame member (8). 
A mould mechanism according to claim 1 characterized in 
that the piston and cylinder device (38) is pivotally 

mounted in the cage assembly (24) about a pivot (32). 
A mould mechanism according to claim 1 characterized in 
that it comprises positioning screws (33) mounted on the  

 
frame member (8) for adjusting the position of the cage 

assembly (24). 
A mould mechanism according to any one of claims 1, 2 
and 3 characterized in that the piston and cylinder device 

(38) is mounted in a generally vertical position in the case 
assembly (24). 
A mould mechanism according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterized in that the piston and cylinder device 

(38) comprises a piston rod (44) which supports rollers 
(60,62) which are constrained to run between substantially 

vertical guides mounted in the cage assembly (24), the links 
(56,58) being pivoted to the rod (44) about the same axis as 

the rollers (60,62). 
A mould mechanism according to anyone of the preceding 
claims wherein the mould mechanism is constructed as a unit 

which may be positioned in an appropriate cavity in a frame 
of a glassware forming machine.
