<ABSTRACT>
A control circuit (120) including a Hall sensor (124) for 
monitoring the position and movement of a magnetic member coupled to an 

actuator piston. The piston is typically part of a pneumatically 
actuated cylinder used to perform a manufacturing step. The Hall 

sensor is periodically powered up by a sensor clock at a 
sufficient voltage to cause the Hall sensor to make a magnetic 

field evaluation. The sensor clock then powers down the Hall 
sensor causing an output from the Hall sensor to be captured by a 

logic cirucit (126). The logic circuit, in turn, activates a 
switch (122) used to activate or de-activate a load (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a proximity switch for monitoring position 
of a magnetic or ferrous actuator such as a pneumatically actuated cylinder. Prior 
art pneumatic cylinders include a magnet, carried by a cylinder piston, which 
allows movement of the piston to be monitored. A sensing probe monitors the 
piston and provides an indication when the piston is fully retracted or fully 
extended. An output from the sensor can then be used to control other manufacturing 
operations or processes. As an example, the output from the sensor could 
be used to co-ordinate two processing steps where a first step is performed by the 
pneumatic cylinder piston and a second step is coordinated to occur after the 
cylinder actuation. U.S. Patent No. 4,571,501 to Crosby which issued February 18, 1986, 
concerns an electronic control circuit that is coupled in series with a load circuit 
for controllably actuating the load circuit. The load can, for example, constitute a 
drive motor or actuator which performs manufacturing processes. One use of the 
circuitry disclosed in the '501 patent is for use with a proximity switch. When the 
proximity switch detects the presence of an object, the switch opens and the electronic 
control circuit is forced into a regeneration mode. This effectively short-circuits 
the control circuit and applies power to a load circuit. One aspect of the 
'501 disclosure concerns the fact that the control circuit has only two wires in 
series with the load. U.S. Patent No. 4,994,738 to Soyck et al. which issued February 19, 1991, 
concerns an inductive proximity switch that uses a high-frequency oscillator, an 
oscillator coil, and analyzing circuit to detect inclination of a proximity switch. A 
circuit core is constructed of ferrite having a thin section with high permeability 
(common to internal and external magnetic fields) and includes a yoke body 
surrounded by the core. As the magnetic field in the vicinity of the highly permeable  
 
thin section changes, this change can be detected and used 
to change a switch output. Proximity switches have been used in conjunction with 
pneumatically actuated cylinders. Use of magnets that move with 
an actuator piston have enabled proximity switches which sense 
magnetic fields to be used as "through the wall" sensors to 
monitor cylinder position. It is believed prior art sensors 
utilize technology similar to that disclosed in the '738 patent 
to Soyck et al. Proximity sensors utilizing a wire coil 
surrounded by a magnetic core structure
