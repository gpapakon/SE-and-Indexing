<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a drive belt (6), in particular suitable 
for a continuously variable transmission, the configuration of the drive 

belt being such that the tilting of the transverse elements of the drive 
belt in the pulley of the continuously variable transmission is largely 

overcome. The drive belt can be produced in a relatively simple and cheap 
way, offers a higher efficiency and less wear.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a drive belt, in particular suitable for 
use in a continuously variable transmission, 
as defined by the features of the preamble of claim 1 known from EP-A 366 169. A further drive belt is known from US Patent Specification 5004450, 
and is used in particular in continuously variable transmissions. The 
drive belt in that case is placed around two pulleys. The pulleys each 
comprise two sheaves, the distance between which is adjustable. Varying 
the distance between the sheaves of the two pulleys will move the drive 
belt to different radial positions on the pulleys, with the result that 
the transmission ratio is adjustable. It is also known from US Patent Specification 4854919 that the 
geometrical design of the pulley/drive belt combination often causes the 
drive belt to run out of true between the two pulleys, so that it also 
runs slightly out of true into the pulleys. The transverse elements of 
the drive belt are consequently received in the pulley slightly tilted in 
a plane at right angles to the carriers. This phenomenon is recognized in 
US Patent Specification 5004450, and is overcome there by designing the 
contact faces of the transverse elements in such a way that the tilted 
transverse elements automatically correct their position in the pulleys 
and straighten up. This works well per se, but the transverse elements, 
on account of their configuration and narrow tolerances, are difficult to 
produce and are relatively expensive. Great forces also occur, with the 
result that overdimensioning of the transverse elements is necessary. The object of the invention is to provide a drive belt in which the 
tilting of the transverse elements is largely overcome, and which is also 
relatively simple to produce, is guaranteed to wedge well in the pulleys, 
and need not be overdimensioned. For this purpose, the invention is 
characterized  
 
by the features of claim 1. In the drive belt according to the invention, the transverse 
element, on the one hand, has sufficient play to position itself relative 
to the carriers and the pulleys, while, on the other hand, a tilting of 
the transverse elements is prevented in such a way that good wedging in 
the pulleys is ensured. The drive belt according to the invention is 
relatively simple and cheap to produce. The invention can be used in particular for drive belts which use 
one or two carriers. Particularly in the range in which the arc tangent is greater than 
0.2° and smaller than 0.8°, the effectiveness is increased, and
