<ABSTRACT>
A pair of plastic tubes (18) are welded together by mounting 
each tube in the clamp jaws (12) of a holder. 

A heated wafer (20) is movably 
mounted in the gap between the tubes to cause the ends of the tubes 

to melt. The melted ends of the opposed tubes are pressed into 
contact with each other to form a welded connection. Each side of 

the wafer has a scoop to remove excess plastic material at the ends 
of the tubes to control the size of the weld connection. A pair of 

structural cam elements is used to create a precise spacing between 
each set of clamp jaws for guiding the wafer to control the plastic 

volume of the weld. The resulting weld is independent of rheology 
of plastic. The same device could also be used for disconnect 

purposes by cutting through a single tube and forming two tube 
sections. Unique double jaw construction is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the total containment
welding of plastic tubes. Various prior art exists disclosing
different approaches for welding plastic tubes together. Prior
patents disclose processes where the weld connection depends on the
melt rheology of plastic resulting in non-uniform size of the weld
connection. No attempt was made in the prior art to gain control
of the size of the weld connection.Prior art also exists disclosing different approaches to
disconnect and seal plastic tubes. Such prior art patents relate
to processes where a single clamp jaw of a holder is used to shut
off the tubing and to form the seal during disconnect resulting in
uncontrolled, nonuniform sealing process.Further, attention is drawn to EP-A-483 478 which relates to a device for total
containment welding of plastic tubes. In said device, plastic tubes are welded by
placing a pair of tubes in a pair of aligned holders, with each tube folded towards
itself. A wafer is moveably mounted in the gap between the tubes and is heated
to cause the ends of the tubes to melt without actually cutting through the tubes.
The melted ends of the opposed tubes can be pressed into contact with each
other to form a welded connection.In accordance with the present invention, a device for selectively connecting and
disconnecting plastic tubes and a wafer for use in a device for selectively connecting
and disconnecting plastic tubes as set forth in claims 1 and 11, respectively,
are provided.Preferred embodiments of the invention are claimed in the dependent claims. An object of this invention is to provide techniques for
the sterile or total containment welding of plastic tubes.A further object of this invention is to provide such
techniques which are particularly adaptable for use with the
melt/wipe system.A still further object of this invention is to provide an
improved clamp jaw construction for effectively resulting in a
sterile sealing of the plastic tubes.In accordance with this invention a pair of aligned tube
holders are spaced from each other to form a gap between the tube
holders. Each of the tube holders has a first clamp jaw and a
second clamp jaw movable relative to each other to selectively 
releasably clamp a plastic tube in a general plane between the
first clamp jaw and second clamp jaw with a portion of the plastic
tube extending into the gap. A wafer is mounted for movement
through the gap. The wafer is in the form of a flat plate having
opposite sides, each of which is disposed toward a respective set
of
