<ABSTRACT>
A disc recording/reproducing system where 
recording/reproduced data rates change stepwise when spiral 

record tracks on a disc medium are divided in multiple zones 
in the radial direction and the disc is rotated and driven at 

a constant angular velocity or when a rotating and driving 
angular velocity changes stepwise for every zone, the disc 

recording/reproducing system is provided with a data rate 
control area provided at the boundary between a first and 

second zones on the disc medium for controlling the 
recording/reproduced data rate, a control area detecting 

means for detecting the data rate control area when 
continuously recording/reproducing data extending over the 

first and second zones and a frequency control means for 
controlling frequency of a recording/reproducing data 

extracting PLL or a recording reference frequency generating 
PLL when the data rate control area is detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a disc
recording/reproducing system, and more particularly, to a
disc recording/reproducing system for performing the
formatting of a disc according to the MCAV (Modified Constant
Angular Velocity) system or the MCLV (Modified Constant
Linear Velocity) system.So far, the CAV (Constant Angular Velocity) system has
been largely used for record formatting of a writable optical
disc for such merits as easy rotating system control, etc.
However, recording/reproducing of voluminous image data has
been demanded in recent years and the MCAV system of which
more large capacity increase is expected has been
increasingly adopted.In the MCAV system, as illustrated in FIGURE 1, it has
been intended to increase the recording capacity of the
entire disc by dividing the recording surface of a disc 600
into several zones concentrically and increasing the number
of sectors per track more at the outer zones than the inner
zones. In FIGURE 1. the numeral 601 shows the n-th recording
zone from the inside of the disc 600, and the numeral 602
shows the (n+1)-th recording zone that is one zone outside
the n-th recording zone.As the disc rotation is regulated to be constant likewise
the CAV system, the control of the rotating system is easy 
but there is such a problem that the data processor becomes
complicated as a recording/reproduced data rate differs for
every zone.The complication of a circuit at the recording side is
not so serious problem, but the processing at the reproducing
side would become complicated as it might become necessary to
adjust reproduced signal waveform equalization in consonance
with data rate changes and a change-over of a frequency in a
data extracting PLL. Furthermore, there is such a problem
that the high level of high-frequency processing technology
is demanded at the outer zones as recording/reproduced data
rate would become high at the outer recording zones.As a method for solving these problems, there is a disc
recording/reproducing system adopting the MCLV system. In
this system, the format on a disc medium is the same as the
MCAV system but the revolution speed for each zone is
variable and a recording/reproduced data rate is kept
constant. In order to change the disc revolution speed, the
rotating control would become somewhat complicated but as the
disc revolution speed has been fixed for each zone, the
control of the rotating system is relatively easy when
compared with the CLV system which requires the control of
the rotation system while

<CLAIMS>
A data recording/reproducing disc for use in
a disc recording/reproducing system in which

recording/reproduced data rates change stepwise when
spiral tracks on a disc medium are divided in multiple

zones in the radial direction and the disc is rotated
and driven at a constant angular velocity or in which

the rotating and driving angular velocity changes
stepwise for every zone, characterised in that the disc

comprises:

an unrecorded data area provided at a boundary
between each zone and the next zone, enabling detecting

means to detect the unrecorded data area, when
continuously recording/reproducing data extends over

said zones, and the frequency of a
recording/reproducing data extracting phase locked loop

or a recording reference frequency generating phase
locked loop to be controlled when the unrecorded data

area is detected.
