<ABSTRACT>
A motorised anti-plaque toothbrush comprises a handle (1) 
at one end of which is a cleaning/massaging head (3), in 

particular a brushing head, which rotates about an axis 
which is approximately perpendicular to the longitudinal 

axis of the handle (1) and is turned with a continuous 
one-way rotary motion or with a reciprocating rotary 

motion by a motor, preferably an electric motor, housed 
in the handle (1). According to the invention, the 

cleaning/massaging head (3) is composed of at least two 
separate cleaning/massaging tool parts (4, 5) that are 

supported coaxially with respect to each other in such a 
way that they can rotate relative to each other, being 

turned in mutually opposite directions in the case of 
continuous one-way rotation and in phase opposition to 

each other in the case of reciprocating rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a motorized anti-plague 
toothbrush comprising a handle at one end of which is a 
cleaning/massaging head, in particular a brushing head, 
which rotates about an axis which is approximately 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the handle and 
is turned with a continuous one-way rotary motion or with 
a reciprocating rotary motion by a motor, preferably an 
electric motor, housed in the handle. The object of the invention is to provide a 
toothbrush of the type described above that will provide 
a more effective cleaning action and plague-removal 
action, whilst at the same time guaranteeing excellent 
treatment of the gingivae from the point of view of 
massaging and cleaning of the gingivae. A further object is to improve the construction 
of a toothbrush of the type described at the outset in 
such a way that the drive parts and transmission parts, 
in particular, are easier to produce and assemble so that 
manufacturing costs are lower and the toothbrush is 
longer-lasting. The invention achieves these objects in the form 
of a toothbrush of the type described at the outset, in 
which the cleaning/massaging head is composed of at least 
two separate cleaning/massaging tool parts that are 
supported coaxially with respect to each other in such a 
way that they can rotate relative to each other, being 
turned in mutually opposite directions in the case of 
continuous one-way rotation and in phase opposition to 
each other in the case of reciprocating rotation.  The rotary drive means and the cleaning/massaging 
tools may be of any type. In the case of a brushing head, this head is 
composed of at least one tubular outer brush and at least 
one central inner brush that is coaxial with and rotates 
relative to the tubular outer brush, the bristles of both 
brushes lying genrally parallel to the axis of rotation 
or of oscillation. The free ends of the bristles of the tubular 
outer brush and central inner brush may terminate on the 
same flat or curved surface or they may be of different 
lengths from each other. The two contrarotating parts of the brushing head 
give enhanced cleaning action and plague-removing action. 
The advantageous gingivae massaging action is also 
improved. According to a further characteristic of the 
invention, the means for turning the two coaxial brushes 
in a reciprocating manner in phase opposition to each 
other comprise: 
a drive shaft that rotates continuously in one 
direction about its axis, which is perpendicular to the 
axis of rotation
