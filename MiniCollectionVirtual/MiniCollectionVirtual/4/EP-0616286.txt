<ABSTRACT>
For connecting the various stations of a data processing installation, a data BUS is used to which all subscribers can have access. According to the invention a method for the automatic allocation of BUS addresses is specified in which each subscriber generates a random address which addresses are interrogated by a controller. Following collisions recognized by the controller this process is repeated until an unequivocal address is allocated to each subscriber.
