<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CHLORINE DIOXIDEField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a method for produc¬ ing chlorine dioxide (CIO2) disinfecting solution which preferably minimizes the amount of residual chlorite ion (C102") so that the disinfecting solution can be used in the food, food processing, drinking water, pharmaceutical produc¬ tion and medical and dental related industries.The present invention also relates to a method for generation of chlorine dioxide (CIO2) in low acidity disin¬ fecting compositions which suitable for applications where corrosion, a pH related property, is a concern and is required to be either prevented or minimized so that the disinfecting composition can be used in the treatment of metal-containint substrates such as dental and medical instruments and devices.Background of the InventionChlorine dioxide, an indirect food additive, has been found to be especially useful as a disinfectant, antiseptic and sanitizer. It is widely used to disinfect drinking water and various water supplies. In addition, chlorine dioxide finds use as a bleaching agent for flour, fats, textiles and as an antiseptic.Although it has great beneficial chararacteristics, chlorine dioxide can not be transported commercially as a con¬ centrated gas for its use and instead has been generated at the site where it is used.Chlorine dioxide has shown great utility as an antiseptic for treating metal substrates such as dental and medical instruments and devices. However, the prior art meth¬ ods for generating chlorine dioxide suffer from the disad¬ vantage that large quantities of chlorite remain as a residue. Chlorite residues on food handling equipment and medical and dental surfaces that are to come in contact with humans are to be avoided or substantially minimized according to FDA and EPA regulations. 

 Separately, chlorine dioxide exhibits certain cor¬ rosive properties which are believed to be pH related. Thus, it is beneficial to generate chlorine dioxide at a pH which would avoid or minimize corrosion during the disinfecting process.The production of CIO2 solutions is well known in the art. The general prior art procedure has been to mix sodium chlorite (N Clθ2) with an acid. As a rule, the stronger the acid, the faster and more efficient will be the production of chlorine dioxide. The general formula for the production of chlorine dioxide using sodium bisulfate is as follows:(1) HNaS04 < > Na+ + S0 — + H+ (sodium bisulfate ionization)(2) .NaC102 + H+ < > HC102 (sodium chlorite
