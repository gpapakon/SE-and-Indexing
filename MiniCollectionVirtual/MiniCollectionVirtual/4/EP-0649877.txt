<CLAIMS>
Cross-linkable mixtures having self-lubricating
properties in the fully cured state, essentially

consisting of

a) 100 parts by weight of at least one cross-linkable
silicone rubber,
b) from 0.5 to 10 parts by weight, based on the
total amount of the mixture, of at least one

arylphosphoric acid ester which is not
compatible with the silicone compositions,

selected from the group consisting of
tri(isopropyl) phenyl phosphate, 2-ethylhexyl

diphenyl phosphate, diphenyl cresyl phosphate
and α-methylbenzyl phenyl phosphate, so that

a lubricating film is formed in the
cross-linked product, and
c) an unreactive, non-inhibiting silicone-incompatible
oil and/or filler.
Mixtures according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the cross-linkable silicone rubber (a)

consists of one or a mixture of a plurality of
silicone rubbers of the formula II


 
in which

R and R' are alkyl radicals having 1 to 8 carbon
atoms, aryl radicals, vinyl radicals and

fluoroalkyl radicals having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, so
that the polymer contains from 0.0002 to 3% by

weight of vinyl groups, and x is varied so that the
viscosity of the polymer is from 0.1 to 30,000 Pa · s,

where the silicone rubber can optionally contain
fillers and hydrophobicizing agents.
Mixtures according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the silicone rubber (a) is an addition-cross-linking

silicone rubber with hydrogensiloxane
as cross-linking agent.
Mixtures according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the silicone rubber (a) is a peroxidically

cross-linkable silicone rubber.
Mixtures according to Claim 1, characterized in
that component (c) is present in an amount of from

0.5 to 5 parts by weight.
Process for the preparation of mixtures according
to Claim 1, characterized in that components (a) to

(c) are stirred with one another.
Moulding having self-lubricating properties,
obtainable by introducing components (a), (b) and

(c) according to Claim 1 into a mould, followed by
vulcanization at excess pressure and a temperature

of from 50 to 250°C.
