(12) formed integrally with said membrane portion and 
arranged to abut against a fixed part (14) when the 

membrane portion is elastically deformed. The reaction 
of the said abutment portion to the deformation of the 

said membrane portion varies non-linearly, and as a

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sealed liquid vibration
damping apparatus such as a suspension mounting device
or an engine mounting device of a vehicle, and more
particularly such an apparatus which has non-linear
damping characteristics.Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 64-1566
discloses such a vibration damping apparatus comprising
a first bracket for attachment to a body, a second
bracket for attachment to a vibrating member, a rubber
portion provided between the two brackets, a liquid
chamber provided in the rubber portion, and a rubber
partition wall dividing the liquid chamber into two sub-chambers,
wherein the rubber partition wall is
integrally formed with an orifice providing
communication between two liquid chambers and a membrane
portion with a thin centre region.It is desirable for such a vibration damping
apparatus to display both a low dynamic spring
characteristic and a high vibration damping
characteristic, the low dynamic spring characteristic
effectively absorbing vibrations of higher frequency and
smaller amplitude (hereinafter referred to as small
vibrations) such as engine vibrations, while the high
vibration damping characteristic provides sufficient
damping when vibrations of lower frequency and smaller
amplitude are present, such as shake vibrations
resulting from tire imbalance, or when vibrations of
lower frequency and larger amplitude (hereinafter
referred to as large vibrations) occur, such as
vibrations from a suspension in response to an irregular
road surface.It is possible to provide such a known vibration
damping apparatus with a low dynamic spring 
characteristic by decreasing the spring constant of the
membrane portion, but if the deformation of the membrane
portion remains unchanged it then becomes impossible to
obtain sufficient high vibration damping, since the
elastic deformation of the membrane portion becomes
correspondingly larger when a large vibration is
applied. Accordingly, it becomes necessary to provide
the membrane portion with a deformation control portion
for controlling deformation in excess of a predetermined
amount. However, if the membrane portion is provided
with such a deformation control portion, it is not only
controlled in its deformation but also imparts a sudden
damping force, which can make a passenger feel an
uncomfortable shock. Also, since a striking sound
occurs when the membrane portion contacts the
deformation control portion, it may become an undesired
source of noise. Further, a step-like change of the
spring constant in such a
