<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automobile sunvisor 
structured on a hollow body formed by blow or injection 
moulding of a plastics material. Automobile sunvisors manufactured from a hollow body 
formed by blow moulding a plastics material, such as, 
among others, polypropylene and polythene, are well known 
and widely produced industrially. As a known embodiment of such sunvisors, there may be 
cited Spanish patent P 9100391 (corresponding to EP-A-0 
525 148) which discloses a sunvisor in which the said 
hollow body comprises a fixing spring for receiving the 
pivot pin of the support attached to the vehicle 
structure, so that the sunvisor may be rotated about such 
pivot pin and the support itself, a hanging bridge, which 
may engage a corresponding support, also attached to said 
structure, an external sheath-like covering formed by a 
sheet of thin plastics material, conferring on the 
sunvisor an external finish in accordance with the finish 
of the vehicle passenger compartment, and any additional 
device such as may be the so-called vanity mirror which 
is normally included as original equipment in the 
passenger side sunvisor. Further to the foregoing, the 
sunvisor hollow body according to Spanish patent P 
9100391 (corresponding to EP-A-0 525 148) is completely  
 
filled with a plastics material acting as structural 
reinforcement and avoiding, under normal conditions of 
use, the deformation of the sunvisor. A further known embodiment of said sunvisors is the one 
disclosed in Spanish patent P 9102450 (corresponding to 
EP-A-0 562 085 published on 29.09.93) which describes a sunvisor comprising 
the above mentioned functional members, i.e., a fixing 
spring, a hanging bridge, an external sheath-like 
covering and the said additional device. In this case, 
i.e. in the sunvisor of Spanish patent P 9102450 
(corresponding to EP-A-0 562 085), the structural 
reinforcement of the hollow body is achieved with a 
plurality of ribs disposed (on the inside of the larger 
facing sides. The structural reinforcing members described above 
included in the hollow bodies of the sunvisors of Spanish 
patents P 9100391 (corresponding to EP-A-0 525 148) and P 
9102450 (corresponding to EP-A-0 562 085) confer on said 
sunvisors a high degree of rigidity which gives the user 
a feeling of excessive hardness when handling such 
sunvisors and which in certain cases may mean that the 
finish of such sunvisors is clearly not in keeping with 
the interior finish of the vehicle passenger compartment 
when it is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An automobile sunvisor comprising the following 
members: a hollow body (1) formed by blow or injection 

moulding of a plastics material, preferably a polyolefin 
such as polypropylene, having an essentially rectangular 

prismatic shape and the contour of which is variable in 
accordance with the configuration of the automobile 

passenger compartment; a fixing spring (2) arranged in 
the inside of the hollow body (1) and dimensioned to 

receive the corresponding pivot pin (8) of a bent support 
(9) attached to the vehicle structure and having means 

(10-
10'
) which, when the sunvisor is attached to said 
support, enables the sunvisor to be rotated by the user 

about said pivot pin (8) and occupy stable positions of 
use and the rest position(s) of the sunvisor to be set; a 

hanging bridge (3) which, suitably disposed relative to 
the fixing spring (2), may engage a corresponding support 

also attached to the vehicle structure, said hanging 
bridge (3), when engaged with the said support, providing 

the sunvisor with an additional point of support for 
relieving possible mechanical overloads on the coupling 

of the pivot pin (8) of the bent support (9) with the 
fixing spring (2); structural reinforcing means (
RE
) 
which, arranged in the inside of the hollow body (1), 

prevents the sunvisor from being deformed under normal 
conditions of use; an external sheath-like covering (4) 

made from a plastics material, preferably polypropylene, 
providing the sunvisor with a surface finish in keeping 

with the interior finish of the automobile passenger 
compartment; a sheet of soft spongy material (17-
17'
) is 
comprised between the hollow body (1) itself and the 

external covering (4), wherewith the latter is provided 
defining a corresponding soft area (M-M') covering the 

zones where normally the user presses when he takes hold 
of the sunvisor; and, as a discretionary selected  

 
complementary feature, an additional device such as may 

be the so-called vanity mirror which is normally included 
as original equipment in the passenger side sunvisor;
 
and which is characterized in that: 


on one or both of the larger sides (15-
15'
) of the 
hollow body (1) there is a respective recess (16-
16'
) of 
substantially constant depth, the length and contour of 

which are variable, depending on the dimensions and shape 
of said hollow body (1), said recess (16-
16'
) forming the 
housing for the sheet of soft spongy material (17-
17'
) 
which is dimensioned in length and thickness to be housed 

snugly in said recess (16-
16'
), flush with the 
corresponding outer surface of the hollow body (1). 
An automobile sunvisor comprising the following 
members: a hollow body (1) formed by blow or injection 

moulding of a plastics material, preferably a polyolefin 
such as polypropylene, having an essentially rectangular 

prismatic shape and the contour of which is variable in

set; a hanging bridge (3) which, suitably disposed 
relative to the fixing spring (2), may engage a 

corresponding support also attached to the vehicle

said support, providing the sunvisor with an additional 
point of support for relieving possible mechanical 

overloads on the coupling of the pivot pin (8) of the 
bent support (9) with the fixing spring (2); structural  

 
reinforcing means (
RE
) which, arranged in the inside of 
the hollow body (1), prevents the sunvisor from being

sheath-like covering (4) made from a plastics material, 

preferably polypropylene, providing the sunvisor with a 
surface finish in keeping with the interior finish of the
