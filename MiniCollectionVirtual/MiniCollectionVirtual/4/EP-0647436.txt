<ABSTRACT>
An implant and method for use in reattaching a 
removed bone section following bone surgery by using a 

bone engaging clamp adapted to fit over the outer 
surface of the removed bone section and engage cables 

to attach the removed bone to the desired location. 
The bone engaging clamp is adapted to fit over at least 

a portion of the outer surface of the removed bone 
section and has an inner surface for engaging the bone 

section. Further, the bone engaging clamp has at least 
one means for holding a cable; and means for clamping a 

tensioned cable in a fixed position relative to the 
bone engaging clamp to hold the removed bone section 

securely in place at the point of reattachment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to an apparatus 
and method useful for the reattachment of a bone 
section removed during surgery and, more particularly, 
to a clamp and cable system for reattaching the dome 
portion of the greater trochanter to prevent migration 
of the removed bone section until it fuses to remaining 
bone. Hip surgery often requires osteotomy of the dome 
portion of the greater trochanter to access the hip 
joint. Following such surgery it is important that 
removed bone portions that are being replaced are 
secured in place to promote efficient healing through 
fusion of the replaced portion with the remainder of 
the femur. Many surgeons simply reattach the removed 
trochanter section after implanting a hip prosthesis by 
wiring the replaced section to the trochanter. This 
has proved unsatisfactory because of forces that cause 
the replaced section to shift or rotate when the 
patient is walking or rising up from a seat. It is not 
uncommon for surgical wires to break because of the 
magnitude of these forces.  A trochanter reattachment system used in the past 
is known as the Dall-Miles system, described in U.S. 
patent 4,269,180. This system utilizes an H-shaped 
clamp which is held in place on the reattached bone 
section by teeth that engage the outer surface of the 
domed segment and teeth that are embedded. Cables are 
passed through holes in the bridge of the clamp and 
through holes drilled in the femur. The bridge of the 
clamp is crimped onto the cables to fix them in 
position. The Dall-Miles system has experienced cable 
failure related problems, which are believed to be 
caused by sharp bends which the cables are forced to 
make as they exit the bridge of the clamp. Such cable 
failures not only result in the clamp loosening but 
also tissue irritation caused by frayed cable ends. The Dall-Miles system is not particularly 
effective in providing rotational and vertical 
stability for the trochanter segment. Since the 
attachment cables must pass through the single bridge 
of the H-shaped clamp, the clamp can rotate about the 
bridge. Vertical stability is also lacking because the 
clamp is configured such that the cables must pass 
through the femur only in a single direction in the 
vicinity of the lesser trochanter. U.S. patent application Serial Number 07/994,320 
describes a clamp contoured to fit the outer surface of 
the domed segment of the greater trochanter. The clamp 
is formed with angled grooves and insertable cable 
crimping devices for providing improved

A medical implant adapted to engage a bone surface and be 
held in place by a cable, the implant having a mating surface for 

mating with bone and an outer surface, the implant comprising: 

(a) a bone engaging member adapted to fit over at least a 
portion of the outer surface of a section of bone, the member having 

an inner surface adapted for engaging the bone section and an outer 
non-bone engaging surface; 
(b) at least one holding means, associated with the bone 
engaging member, for holding the cable in a fixed position relative to 

the bone engaging member; 
   and 
(c) clamping means movable between clamping and non-clamping 
positions for clamping the cable in a fixed position against 

the bone engaging member when the clamping means is moved to 
its clamping position. 
The implant of claim 1, wherein the outer surface of the bone 
engaging member is generally convex and the inner surface of said 

member is generally concave. 
The implant of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the bone engaging 
member comprises opposing sidewalls extending between the inner 

and outer surfaces thereof; and the cable holding means comprises 
a plurality of parallel through bores that extend through the bone 

engaging member to provide openings for insertion of cable at 
opposite side walls of the bone engaging member. 
The implant of claim 3, wherein one of the through bores has 
a centre and is flared outwardly from said centre as said bore 

extends to the openings at the opposite side walls of the bone 
engaging member. 
The implant of any preceding claim, wherein the clamping 
means comprises:

 
   means operatively associated with the outer surface of the 

bone engaging member and a second means, engaged with said 
operatively associated means, for clamping cable against inner 

surfaces of the through bores. 
The implant of claim 5, wherein the operatively associated 
means comprises a plurality of threaded openings extending into the 

through bores and the second means engaged with the threaded 
openings comprise a plurality of screws engageable in the threaded 

openings. 
The implant of any preceding claim further including a plurality 
of spikes projecting from the inner surface of the bone engaging 

member for engaging co-operating holes in a removed bone section. 
A system for reattaching a removed bone section from the 
greater trochanter of a femur, the femur having a greater trochanter, 

a lesser trochanter and a lateral cortex, the greater trochanter having 
a lower side adjacent to the lateral cortex, the removed bone section 

having a surface for mating with bone at a point for reattachment and 
an outer non-bone engaging surface, the system comprising: 


(a) a bone engaging member adapted to fit over at least a 
portion of the outer surface of the removed bone section to be 

reattached, the member having an inner surface for engaging the 
bone section and an outer non-bone engaging surface;

(c) a plurality of cables, at least one of which is for extending 
around the femur, across the lesser trochanter and into one of the 

cable holding portions, and another of said cables for wrapping 
around the lower side adjacent to the lateral cortex and extending 

around the femur, across the lesser trochanter into one of the cable 
holding portions; and 
(d) clamping means for holding the cables in tension in the 
cable holding portions.

entire width of the bone engaging member having openings at 
opposite sides of the bone engaging member, two cables for
