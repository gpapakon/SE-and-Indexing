<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a moisture-curable 
polyurethane composition. In another aspect, this 
invention relates to a moisture-curable hot-melt 
adhesive having improved heat resistance as well as 
good adhesion to substrates having low surface 
energies. Moisture-curable polyurethane compositions are 
well known. They are generally used as adhesives, 
coatings, sealers, and casting materials. Moisture 
curable adhesives that adhere to unprimed substrates 
are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,539,345 and 
4,661,542. These compositions comprise an isocyanate-functional 
prepolymer, a tackifier and, optionally, a 
plasticizer. U.S. Patent No. 4,891,269 describes hot 
melt, pressure-sensitive, moisture-curable polyurethane 
compositions that have high green strength, 
extended pot life, high ultimate strength, and high 
elongation at break. These compositions comprise (a) a 
liquid urethane prepolymer made by reacting a polyisocyanate 
with a polyhydroxy compound having a 
molecular weight of less than about 20,000; (b) a 
tackifying resin; and (c) a polyethylene-vinyl monomer 
component. Moisture-curable hot-melt type adhesives 
comprising urethane prepolymers made from hydrocarbon-based 
polyols with hydroxyl end groups and 
diisocyanates are described in Kokai Nos. 2-272013 and 
3-36015. In EP-A-420246, hot-melt adhesive compositions 
having improved heat resistance, reduced odor, 
and improved storage stability are disclosed. These  
 
adhesives comprise a urethane prepolymer, obtained by 
reacting a diisocyanate with a polyolefin diol having a 
hydroxyl group at each end, and a tackifier. Briefly, the present invention provides a 
moisture-curable hot-melt adhesive composition comprising 
a polyisocyanate-reacted maleated polyolefin. In another aspect, the present invention provides 
an article of manufacture comprising at least one 
substrate, preferably independently a transportation 
vehicle or a glazing material, and a layer of the above 
moisture-curable hot-melt adhesive composition, with 
the proviso that, where two or more substrates are 
present, said layer is between at least two of said 
substrates. In a further aspect, the present invention 
provides a method for preparing a moisture-curable hot-melt 
adhesive composition comprising the step:
 
   polymerizing a maleated polyolefin with at least 
one polyisocyanate, optionally in the presence of 
at least one of a catalyst and a tackifier. The present invention provides a hot-melt adhesive 
composition which can be moisture cured to a 
cro
