<ABSTRACT>
A gate drive circuit for a bidirectional blocking 
MOSFET, the bidirectional blocking MOSFET being 

characterized in the source region is not shorted to the 
body region. In one embodiment, the gate drive circuit 

includes diodes connected between the source/drain regions 
and a charge pump, the charge pump generating a gate drive 

voltage applied to a gate of the bidirectional blocking 
MOSFET. In a second embodiment, a charge pump generates a 

gate drive voltage which is applied to the gate of the 
bidirectional blocking MOSFET, and is also connected to 

the source/drain regions through zener diodes. In the 
second embodiment, the potential applied to the gate of 

the bidirectional blocking MOSFET is limited to a zener 
diode drop above the lower of the voltages of the 

source/drain regions. In a third embodiment, a charge 
pump generates a floating gate drive voltage which is 

applied to gate of the bidirectional blocking MOSFET 
through first and second depletion mode MOSFETS. In the 

third embodiment, the gate drive voltage is limited to the 
threshold level of the first and second depletion mode 

MOSFETs and the voltage present on the more negative of 
the source/drain regions. In the second and third 

embodiments, the limited gate drive allows for a minimal 
gate oxide thickness, thereby improving switch resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the subject matter of
copending European Application Published No. 660 520,
together with the subject matter of US Application Numbers
08/159,900 and 08/219,586 from which that European
Application claims priority and of which copies are filed
herewith and is also related to the subject matter of
European Application Published No. 656 662 together with
the US Application No. 08/160539 from which that European
Application claims priority and of which a copy is filed
herewith. Both of these related European applications are
filed on the same day as this application.The present invention related to a gate drive circuit
and a method for generating a gate drive voltage.The invention is particularly applicable to users of
battery-powered devices such as notebook computers who
require that the devices be usable for long periods of
time between battery recharges. This requirement has led
to cascaded battery arrangements, in which a primary
battery, a secondary batter, etc., are connected to the
device in succession. Frequently an AC/DC converter is
also provided to allow the user to conserve battery power
when he is near a source of AC power. A connection for an
external backup battery may also be provided.A known arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 1 wherein
a primary battery B1 and a secondary batter B2 are
connected via switches S1 and S2, respectively, to a load
L, which could be a DC/DC converter supplying, for
example, a notebook computer. The supply connections are
made through a bus which is designated B. Also connected to bus B is an AC/DC converter C3
which supplies power through a switch S3. The voltage
supplied by primary battery B1 is designated V1, the
voltage supplied by secondary battery B2 is designated V2,
and the voltage supplied by AC/DC converter C3 is
designated V3. A backup battery B4 is also connected to
bus B.In the operation of this multiple battery
arrangement, only one of switches S1, S2, and S3 would
normally be closed at any given time. The remaining
switches would be open. When power is supplied by primary
battery B1, for example, switch S1 is closed and switches
S2 and S3 are open.As the power sources are switched in and out, the
voltage across switches S1, S2, and S3 can vary both in
magnitude and direction. This is illustrated in Figs. 2A-2C.
As shown in Fig. 2A, for example, the output V2 of
battery B2 might be 14 V at a given point in time. If
battery B2 is then supplying power, the voltage Vbus would
also equal 14 V. If battery B1 is fully
