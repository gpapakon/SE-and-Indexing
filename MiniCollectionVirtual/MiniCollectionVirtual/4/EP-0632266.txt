<ABSTRACT>
A system for accurate and precise measurements of 
carbohydrate-containing compound(s) in a sample is 

provided. The system uses piezoelectric surface wave 
sample devices which have a receptor layer containing 

lectins, lectin subunits or lectin analogs which have 
been selected because they are complementary to and 

have affinity for the carbohydrate-containing 
compound(s) to be measured. At least one piezoelectric 

surface wave reference device is also used to account 
for interferences. The measurement instrument 

correlates the data from the sample and reference 
devices and provides data on the presence and/or amount 

of carbohydrate-containing compound in the sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to analytical 
chemistry, and more particularly, to devices and 
methods for analyzing carbohydrates. In the field of carbohydrate chemistry, there is a 
great need for the development of simple and reliable 
techniques for carbohydrate analysis. Novel 
carbohydrates, glycoproteins and other glycoconjugates  
 
which are useful for the treatment of such diseases or 
conditions as cancer and acute inflammatory disease, 
have been developed. Analysis of the specific 
structure of these compounds is important for 
understanding the carbohydrate's binding and receptor 
capabilities. If the compound is used therapeutically, 
the microheterogenicity of the oligosaccharide must 
also be monitored for FDA purposes. Monitoring of 
sugar levels in fermentation systems or bioreactors in 
the pharmaceutical, food or biotechnology industries 
can also be critical. Presently known analytical techniques for 
glycoconjugate characterization are difficult and 
require expensive instrumentation, such as x-ray 
crystallography and NMR. Other analytical techniques 
require the use of secondary "detection" reagents such 
as chromophores or radiolabelled compounds. The use of 
such methods as optical rotation to detect sugars in 
solution requires conditions of low signal response 
from other optically-active compounds and low 
scattering media, conditions which are not typically 
found in fermenters or bioreactors. Piezoelectric sensors have been used as 
microgravimetric immunoassay devices. (See, for 
example, Joy E. Roederer and Glenn J. Bastiaans, 
"Microgravimetric Immunoassay with Piezoelectric 
Crystals", Anal. Chem., 2333-2336 (1983). These 
sensors operate on the principle that changes in the 
amount of mass attached to their surface cause shifts 
in the resonant frequency. Selective mass detection is 
achieved by coating the surface of the piezoelectric 
crystal with a chemically reactive layer that 
preferentially reacts with the substance to be detected 
such that the mass of the chemically reactive layer  
 
changes. Such devices function as chemical sensors 
that can measure the concentration of the selected 
class of compounds in a solution into which the sensor 
or device is immersed. Radio frequency energy coupled 
into the device through the input transducer is 
converted to a surface acoustic wave confined to within 
a few wavelengths of the surface. The velocity of the 
surface acoustic wave will vary according to the mass 
loading of the top surface of the device. The
