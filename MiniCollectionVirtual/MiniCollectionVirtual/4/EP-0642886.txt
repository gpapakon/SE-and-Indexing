<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power transmission belts/belt sleeves and, more
particularly, to a method of forming at least one of a rib and groove on one or both of the
inside and outside belt/belt sleeve surfaces and, in the latter case, for maintaining precise
lateral alignment between the fibs and grooves on the inside and outside surfaces of the
belt/belt sleeve. The invention is also directed to an apparatus for carrying out the above
method, as per the preamble of claim 1. An example
of such an apparatus is disclosed by EP 533 505 A.In Examined Japanese Patent Publication No. 52-17552, one known method of
manufacturing a V-ribbed belt is disclosed. An outer canvas layer, an outer rubber layer,
a tension resistant layer, and an inner rubber layer are sequentially laminated, one against
the other, around a mandrel to define a belt sleeve. The sleeve is then vulcanized. A
grinding wheel, having alternating projections and recesses that are complementary to a
desired rib and groove configuration on the belt sleeve, is pressed against the exposed
inner rubber layer on the mandrel to form alternating ribs and grooves on the sleeve.In another known method, which has been recently practiced, a belt sleeve is
trained around spaced supports. One of the supports is driven to advance the belt sleeve
in an endless path. The belt sleeve is driven in an inside out orientation to expose the
inside belt layer. A grinding wheel with diamond abrasive on the peripheral surface
thereof is pressed against the moving belt sleeve to define the alternating ribs and grooves
on the belt sleeve. It is also known to construct a "double-rib" belt having
laterally spaced, longitudinally extending driving/driven ribs on
both the inside and outside surfaces of the belt.In one conventional method for manufacturing a double-rib belt,
shown in EP0533505, a belt sleeve is trained around spaced
supports. One of the supports has an element which is driven to
advance the belt sleeve in an endless path. A rotary grinding wheel, as described above,
is pressed against one of the inside and outside surfaces of the belt sleeve to define
alternating ribs and grooves thereon. The belt sleeve is then removed from the supports,
turned inside out and re-mounted on the supports. Using the same grinding wheel, the
other of the inside and outside surfaces of the belt sleeve is engaged to form alternating
ribs and grooves matching those on the first formed surface.To avoid "mis-pitch", it is important to maintain the lateral alignment of the ribs
and
