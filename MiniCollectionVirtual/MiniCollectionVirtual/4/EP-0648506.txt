<ABSTRACT>
A sterility indicator device for use in a steam autoclave to 
determine the degree of completion of a steam sterilisation 

process, the process being intended to result in 100% spore 
kill of any pathogenic spores. The device comprises an 

aluminium foil backing strip and a polymeric film adhesively 
laminated to the strip, the backing strip having a pocket or 

depression embossed in it. A quantity of an organic compound 
is located on the backing strip, the compound having a normal 

melting point which is greater than the predetermined control 
temperature for the process by from about 2.5°C to about 28°C, 

and which is depressed below the control temperature by the 
absorption of water into the organic compound when the organic 

compound is exposed to saturated steam at about the control 
temperature. One end of wicking means is in intimate contact 

with the compound, and the wicking means extending away from 
the compound to the distal end of the backing strip. A water 

vapour transmission rate controlling cover strip covers the 
compound and the wicking means, is permeable to water vapour, 

and has a water permeability coefficient at the control 
temperature such that sufficient water vapour will permeate the 

cover strip to reduce the melting point of the organic compound 
from its normal melting point at least to the control 

temperature. The device is unresponsive to heat at the control 
temperature in the absence of steam, and displays visual 

response of the integrated time/temperature exposure of a 
system to moist heat.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for indicating sterility, 
for example to indicate sterility in a steam sterilization 
process. In particular it relates to a steam sterilization 
process monitor of the integrating type. It is well known that heat will destroy microorganisms. The 
presence of moisture accelerates this destruction by denaturing 
or coagulation of the protein making up the microorganism. The 
importance of moist heat in the sterilization process has been 
known for about 100 years. While Pasteur had established the 
fact that temperatures above the boiling point of water were 
required to kill many organisms, it was not until 1880 that a 
steam pressure sterilizer was developed. However, there was no 
significant notice of the need for sterilization of hospital 
equipment and fabrics until the introduction of first 
antiseptic and then aseptic surgery. About the turn of the century manually controlled sterilizing 
autoclaves were introduce into hospitals. Their efficiency 
left much to be desired, but nonetheless, this was a definite 
step forward. As a result of advances in the food industry a 
fuller understanding of parameters required for spore kill were 
developed, and it was determined that the order of death was 
logarithmic. The most significant aspect in the development of safe and 
effect sterilization techniques was the recognition of the 
presence of moisture in the killing of microorganisms. Most 
microorganisms contain sufficient moisture so that moderate 
heat alone, for example to 80° to 100°C, will destroy the 
microorganism. Most bacterial spores, however, contain 
substantially no moisture. Their destruction by dry heat alone 
requires elevated temperatures in excess of 150°C. Such 
excessive temperatures can result in the destruction of the 
article to be sterilized, or otherwise seriously limit its  
 
useful life. Hence, in the hospital arena pathogenic spores 
are destroyed using a steam atmosphere in autoclaves. While the first effective steam sterilizers were conventionally 
operated at about 121°C (250°F) for sterilization cycles of 
about 12 to 15 minutes, the preferred sterilization conditions, 
presently, are about 132°C (270°F) for about 3 minutes. Lacking any adequate means of monitoring the process, to ensure 
an adequate safety margin, sterilization times as long as 
thirty minutes have been used, to ensure that all of the 
pathogenic spores have been killed. Such long sterilization 
cycle times give the operator a degree of confidence that steam 
has

A sterility indicator device for use in a steam autoclave 
to determine the degree of completion of a steam sterilisation 

process at or about a predetermined control temperature in the 
range of about 120°C to about 135°C, the process being intended 

to result in 100% spore kill of any pathogenic spores, the 
device comprising: 


(a) an aluminium foil backing strip and a polymeric 
film adhesively laminated to the strip, the backing strip 

having a pocket or depression embossed in it; 
(b) a quantity of an organic compound that is located 
on the backing strip, the compound having a normal 

melting point which is greater than the predetermined 
control temperature by from about 2.5°C to about 28°C, 

the said normal melting point being depressed below the 
control temperature by the absorption of water into the 

organic compound when the organic compound is exposed to 
saturated steam at about the control temperature; 
(c) wicking means of which one end is in intimate 
contact with the compound, the wicking means extending 

away from the compound to the distal end of the backing 
strip; and
