<ABSTRACT>
A method for shot peening a first tube (70) 
external to and concentric with a second tube (120) comprising 

the steps of forming a slot (190) through the 
second tube (120); positioning a shot peening device (200) 

adjacent the notch in the second tube (120) for propelling 
shot peening balls (245); propelling the shot peening balls 

(245) through the slot (190) in the second tube (120) for 
shot peening the second tube (120); and rotating the second 

tube (120) in increments for shot peening an entire 
circumferential portion of the first tube (70) positioned 

outwardly and radially from the slot (190).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to shot 
peening and, more particularly, is concerned with a system 
and method for shot peening reactor vessel penetrations. In nuclear power generation, a reactor vessel is 
the primary vessel wherein heat is created for producing 
steam. Uranium pellets positioned within the reactor 
vessel produce a controlled nuclear fission for generating 
this heat. The cylindrical reactor vessel includes a 
hemispherical bottom and a flanged, removable upper head. 
To control the nuclear fission process, a plurality of 
control rods are selectively inserted into or withdrawn in 
predetermined fashion from the reactor vessel. Control 
rods are typically stainless steel tubes encapsulating an 
absorber material, and extend into the reactor vessel when 
fully inserted. To accomplish this control rod insertion, 
a plurality of penetrations (stainless steel tubes) pass 
through the reactor head and into the interior of the 
reactor vessel. A tubular shaped thermal sleeve is disposed 
concentrically inside each penetration and external 
to the control rods ( i.e., between the penetration and the 
control rod). The thermal sleeve includes a flange at each 
end. One flange rests on a chamfered end of the penetration 
tube for support, and the other flange extends beyond 
the corresponding opposite end of the penetration. This 
arrangement, in effect, prevents the thermal sleeve from 
being removed. The thermal sleeve protectively covers the  
 
control rods and functions to protect the control rods from 
acute temperature changes. The penetrations are welded by conventional 
methods to the reactor vessel head for structural support. 
However, this welding, although structurally sound, causes 
stress on the penetrations adjacent the weldments. It 
becomes, therefore, desirable to relieve this stress on the 
penetrations. It is well known in the art that shot 
peening relieves this type of stress on such tubes. Although shot peening is efficient, it is not 
without drawbacks in certain situations. Conventional shot 
peening methods have drawbacks where a liner (such as the 
thermal sleeve) surrounds the tube to be shot peened. This 
is because, typically, there is only an eighth of an inch 
between the sleeve and the penetration. It is, therefore, 
difficult to effectively shot peen behind this liner 
without removing the thermal sleeve and, consequently, 
causing damage to the thermal sleeve during such removal. 
Replacing a damaged penetration is costly and time consuming.
