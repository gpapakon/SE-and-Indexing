<ABSTRACT>
A metal-halide discharge lamp having a ceramic discharge vessel (4) is sealed at its ends (6) by means of two glass solders (14a, b). They have the composition Al2O3, SiO2, MxOy. The first, high-melting glass solder (14a) is halide-resistant and is used for the fusing zone in the vicinity of the discharge. It contains 0-12 % by weight of SiO2. The second, low-melting glass solder (14b) is readily fusible and is used for the fusing zone remote from the discharge. It contains 20-40 % by weight of SiO2.

openings being sealed off in vacuum-tight fashion by 
using soldering glass (14), characterized in that a 

component which contains the lead-through is fitted in 
the opening while forming a gap, a first region of the 

gap, close to the discharge, being sealed off using a 
first, high-melting soldering glass (14a), and a second 

region of the gap, remote from the discharge, being 
sealed off with a second, low-melting soldering glass
