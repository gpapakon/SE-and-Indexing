<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a magnetic tape cassette apparatus with a tape guide for a magnetic tape near the magnetic gaps of a magnetic head of the apparatus, having tape-guiding elements (9) arranged in pairs and guiding the magnetic tape between themselves and in relation to the magnetic head or the magnetic gaps thereof. In this arrangement, in each case one pair of the tape-guiding elements is arranged on both sides of the magnetic head in the direct vicinity of the latter and a further pair, lying further outside, is provided at a distance from the magnetic head and the tape-guiding element alongside the latter. The tape-guiding elements are of a fork-shaped design with protruding guide legs, bounding the drawing-through path of the magnetic tape. The distance between the guide legs (9a) of all the tape-guiding elements (9) is set to the maximum tape width (Bmax) of the magnetic tape and the position of the guide legs (9b1,2,9c1,2) of the tape-guiding elements (9) with respect to the tape edges at the magnetic head (7) on the one hand and with respect to the tape-guiding elements (9a, 9d) further away to the outside on the other hand is set such that, with the minimum tape width (Bmin), the magnetic tape (11) in the transporting direction bears with its one edge (11d) against guide legs (9b1, 9c1) at the magnetic head (7) and with its other edge (11c) against guide legs (9a2, 9d2) of the guide elements (9) further to the outside. All the tape-guiding elements (9) and a positioning mount for the magnetic head (7) are formed on a one-piece plastic injection moulding.

A magnetic-tape-cassette apparatus having tape guide means for a magnetic tape with a
given minimum and maximum tape width (B
min
, B
max
), comprising tape guide elements (9)
arranged in pairs which guide the magnetic tape between them and relative to a magnet head

and the head gaps thereof, a first pair of tape guide elements (9b, 9c) being disposed directly
adjacent the magnet head on either side thereof and a second pair of tape guide elements (9a,

9d) being disposed further outward and at a distance from the magnet head and the tape guide
element adjacent this magnet head, the tape guide elements being fork-shaped and having

guide limbs which project so as to bound the transport path of the magnetic tape,
characterized in that

the mutual distance of the guide limbs (9a) of all tape guide elements (9) is dimensioned for
the maximum tape width (B
max
) of the magnetic tape, and in that the positions of the guide
limbs (9b
1,2
, 9c
1,2
) of the first pair of tape guide elements (9b, 9c) with respect to the tape
edges at the magnet head (7) on the one hand and with respect to the further outward tape

guide elements (9a, 9d) are adjusted such that, seen in the transport direction and given the
case of the minimum tape width (B
min
), the magnetic tape (11) has one edge (11d) in contact
with the guide limbs (9b
1
, 9c
1
) of the first pair of tape guide elements at the magnet head (7)
and the other edge (11c) in contact with guide limbs (9a
2
, 9d
2
) of the further outward, second
pair of tape guide elements (9a, 9d), and in that on either side of the magnet head the

respective outwardly situated tape guide elements (9a, 9d) have a distance (D) of
approximately 8 mm to the respective inwardly situated tape guide elements (b, 9c), within

which distance (D) the tape is not guided, in the case of a magnetic tape width of between 3.76
and 3.81 mm.
A magnetic-tape-cassette apparatus as claimed in Claim 1,
characterized in that

the contact faces (9e

edge (11d) of the magnetic tape (11) is in contact while the tape is moving past have a distance

from the central axis (7a) of the magnet gaps (7c) of the magnet head (7), said axis (7a)
extending in the transport direction, corresponding to half the tape width (B
max
) of the
magnetic tape (11) for which the magnet head (7) is aligned relative to the tape guide elements

(9). 
A magnetic-tape-cassette apparatus as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that

all tape guide elements (9) and a positioning holder for the magnet head (7) are constructed as
one integral injection-molded piece..
A magnetic-head/tape guide unit for a magnetic-tape-cassette apparatus having tape guide

them and relative to a magnet head and the head gaps thereof, a first pair of tape guide
elements (9b, 9c) being disposed directly adjacent the magnet head on either side thereof and a
