<ABSTRACT>
Offset active antenna with two co-focal reflectors (5,7) and radiofrequency lens (12) at their common focus, equipped with electronic scanning in azimuth and/or in elevation, especially for microwave imaging by synthetic-aperture radar from a satellite circulating in low orbit. The antenna is constructed according to the "Gregory" geometry, with an auxiliary reflector (7) illuminated by an active array (6) of elementary sources fed by fixed-gain amplifiers (9) with a phase imparted by variable phase-shifters (8). The beam (10) emitted by the elementary sources and reflected (14) by the auxiliary reflector (7) is focussed on the electronic lens (12), which reemits a divergent beam (17) towards the primary reflector (5), which will be reflected into a parallel beam (11). The electronic scanning of the final beam (11) is achieved by acting on the phases imparted by the primary phase-shifters (8), and possibly by phase-shifters (18) for fine adjustment in elevation.

An electronically scanned offset active antenna including:

an array (6) of individual sources (1,2,34) each of which is energized
by an amplifier (9) and an adjustable phase shifter (8);
a first cylindrical-parabolic reflector (7) and a second cylindrical-parabolic
reflector (5); and
a radio frequency lens (12) having two faces:

a first face including a first array (13) of receive sources which is
referred to as the collector, is disposed at the focus (F) of said first reflector

(7)and picks up the beam (10) radiated by said array (6) of individual sources
after it has been reflected by said first reflector (7) in the form of a

concentrated beam (14), and
a second face including a second array (15) of sources which is
referred as the primary array, is disposed at the focus (F') of said second

reflector (5), and relays towards said second reflector (5) energy that is
directed to it by said collector (13) via homothetic interconnections (16)

between the collector (13) and the primary array (15);

said homothetic interconnections (16) including phase shifters (18) and said
electronic scanning of the beam (11) being obtained by acting on the phases

with which the individual sources are excited via said adjustable phase
shifters (8) to divert the beam directed towards the first reflector (7) and

consequently the spot of radiation that falls on said collector (13) so that it
illuminates a nucleus of sources of the collector (13), so that said nucleus of

sources is able to move from a nominal position (n1) to an offset position (n2)
according to the orientation of the beam (11),

which antenna is 
characterized in that
 said amplifiers (9) for energizing the
individual sources have a fixed and predetermined gain and 
in that
 said
phase shifters (18) of said radio frequency lens (12) are adjustable phase

shifters (18) which are disposed between the elements of the first face (13)
and those of the second face (15) of said radio frequency lens (12) and are

controlled by associated control circuits (not shown) to obtain electronic
scanning with a finer resolution and over a wider range of the beam (17)

relayed towards the second reflector (5).
An antenna according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said two faces (13,
15) of said radio frequency lens (12) are parallel. 
An antenna according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said two faces (13,
15) of said radio frequency lens (12) are not parallel.
An antenna according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that

said collector array (13) is smaller than said primary array (15) and the two
arrays include substantially the same number of sources.
An antenna according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the sources of the
collector array (13) are smaller than the sources of the primary array (15).
