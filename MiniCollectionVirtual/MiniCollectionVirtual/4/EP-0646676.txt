<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a maintenance apparatus for maintaining substantially plane surfaces, such as for example green areas, paved surfaces or the like, having a chassis (2) which can be coupled via a drawbar to a drawing vehicle having a power take-off shaft and has at least one axle with at least two running wheels (4), a receiving device (12) which is fixed to the chassis (2) and intended for material picked up from the surface to be maintained, and having a maintenance unit which is arranged on the chassis (2) and possesses at least one rotationally driven maintenance tool (16). A maintenance apparatus of simple construction, which enables good ground adaptation and is adaptable in a simple way to various use conditions, is provided in that the maintenance tool (16) has a frame (14) or the like which can be connected to and detached from the chassis (2) in such a way that the constructional unit (40) thus formed can be removed from or inserted into the chassis (2) independently of other devices.

Maintenance device (1) for the maintenance of substantially plane
surfaces (5), preferably within the local, private or industrial domain,

such as green areas, consolidated surfaces or the like,
comprising a chassis (2) which can be coupled by means of a

drawbar to a drawing vehicle having a power take-off shaft, for
example a tractor or similar vehicle, said chassis (2) having at

least one axle with at least two running wheels (4), a receiving
container (12) fixed to the chassis (2) for receiving material collected

from the surface (5) to be treated, such as for example
parts of plants cut by mowing, swept-up dirt particles such as

leaves, garbage, sand, gravel or the like, and a maintenance aggregate
(15) arranged on the chassis (2) which includes at least

one maintenance tool (16; 17, 18, 19) driven for rotation, such as
a flail type mower (19), a sweeper roll (17) and/or a soil aerator

roll (18) or the like, 
characterized
 in that the maintenance tool
(16; 17, 18, 19) has a frame (14) or similar member which can be

coupled to or uncoupled from the chassis (2) in such a manner
that the modular unit (40) thus formed can be removed from or

slidingly inserted in the chassis (2), independently of other
equipment, and that said modular unit (40) is supported on the

chassis (2) for installation and removal in an approximately horizontal
direction laterally with respect to the travelling direction.
Maintenance device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that
the maintenance tool (16; 17, 18, 19) has an associated transport

roll (23), preferably in the form of a brush driven for rotation and
arranged between the maintenance tool (16; 17, 18, 19) and the

receiving container (12). 
Maintenance device according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that
the maintenance tool (16; 17, 18, 19) and the transport roll (23)

are driven by means of a driving apparatus (8, 9) which can be
driven by the drawing vehicle through the PTO-shaft.
Maintenance device according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that
both the maintenance tool (16; 17, 18, 19), the transport roll (23)

and the driving apparatus (8, 9) are equipped with pulleys (9, 21,
27) which are interconnected through at least one driving belt (22,

28), the rotational speed of the maintenance tool (16; 17, 18, 19)
and the transport roll (23) being adjustable by means of pulleys

(21, 27) correspondingly dimensioned in proportion to the pulley
(9) of the driving apparatus (8, 9).
Maintenance device according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized
 in
that the driving apparatus (8, 9) is rigidly connected to the chassis

(2).
Maintenance device according to one of the claims 2 to 5, 
characterized

in that the support of the maintenance tool (16; 17, 18,
19) within the frame (14) is formed to be displaceable, so that the

coordination in space of the maintenance tool (16; 17, 18, 19) and
the transport roll (23) with respect to each other can be changed.
Maintenance device according to one of the claims 2 to 6, 
characterized

in that the frame (14) with the maintenance tool (16; 16,
18, 19) and the transport roll (23) form a sweeper head (13) which

is supported for pivoting about a center of gravity. 
Maintenance device according to claim 7, 
characterized
 in that
the center of gravity is behind the running wheels (4) in the travel

direction of working.
Maintenance device according to one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterized

in that the chassis (2) includes longitudinal bars (3)
which are formed - preferably with an U-shaped cross section - in

a manner such as to allow for a limited torsion.
Maintenance device according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized

in that all the input respectively output members (9, 22,
21), from the transmission (8) up to the maintenance tools (16;

17, 18, 19), are arranged on the same side of the chassis (2) respectively
the frame (14).
Maintenance device according to one of the claims 1 to 10, 
characterized

in that on the chassis (2), near the maintenance tool
(16; 17, 18, 19), a height-adjustable support (11/10, 42/41) is

provided for contact with the ground (5) to be maintained.
Maintenance device according to claim 11, 
characterized
 in that
the support (41/42) includes a roll (41) rolling off against the

ground (5), which roll preferably extends over a major part of the
width of the maintenance device (1).
Maintenance device according to claim 12, 
characterized
 in that
the roll (41) is provided with a self-cleaning scraper means acting

upon the surface area of the roll. 
Maintenance device according to one of the claims 1 to 13, 
characterized

in that a housing which accommodates the maintenance
aggregate (15), particularly sweeper head (13), is provided in the

zone of the modular unit (40) with a recess at least on one side,
for the lateral removal of said modular unit (40).
