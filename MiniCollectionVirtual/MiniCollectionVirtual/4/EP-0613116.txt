<ABSTRACT>
A method of driving a liquid crystal that has a memory capability, wherein a 
reset voltage is initially applied to the liquid crystal during a reset period, to bring 

about a Frederick's transition in the liquid crystal. During a subsequent selection 
period, a selection voltage that is selected on the basis of a critical value that brings 

about one of two metastables states in the liquid crystal is applied to the liquid 
crystal, and, during a nonselection period that follows the selection period, a 

nonselection voltage that is less than or equal to a threshold value that maintains 
two metastable states is applied to the liquid crystal. A delay period is provided 

between the reset period and the selection period, in order to gain effective timing 
for applying the selection voltage to the liquid crystal after the application of the 

reset voltage has been turned off. This shortens the length of the selection period, 
and hence the write time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of driving a liquid crystal display device that uses a chiral
nematic liquid crystal having two metastable states. More specifically, it relates to a drive method that
improves the speed of writing. The present invention also relates to a drive method that can compensate
the drive voltage to cope with irregularities in the threshold value of the liquid crystal that are specific to
each liquid crystal panel, and provide temperature compensation of the drive voltage. The present
invention further relates to a drive method that ameliorates the imbalance between the voltages of two
different drive waveforms and makes it possible to turn the drive circuitry into an Integrated Circuit chip
(IC).The driving of a liquid crystal that has bistability, using a chiral nematic liquid crystal medium, has
already been disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Publication 1-51818, which includes descriptions of initial
orientation conditions, two metastable states, and a method of switching between these two metastable
states.However, the drive method described in Japanese Laid-Open Publication 1-51818 has many implicit
problems when it comes to practical implementation. For example, the above mentioned publication
discloses two methods for switching between metastable states.The first method obtains the two metastable states as follows: a 360° twist orientation state is
obtained by using a toggle switch to suddenly turn off the voltage (60 Hz, 15 V peak-to-peak) applied to
the liquid crystal; and a 0° uniform orientation state is obtained by using a variable-voltage device to allow
the voltage applied to the liquid crystal to slowly fall over approximately 1 second.The second method is as follows: if a high frequency of 1500 kHz is applied directly to the liquid
crystal after a low-frequency field is turned off, a 360° twist orientation state is enabled. If the 1500-kHz
high-frequency field is applied after a delay of approximately 1/4 second after the same low-frequency
field has been turned off, a 0° uniform orientation state is achieved.The first method is completely impracticable; it can never progress beyond simple verification in the
laboratory. When the present inventors came to experiment with the latter method, they discovered that, if
a high-frequency field is applied after a delay of approximately 1/4 second after the low-frequency field 
has been turned off, the same 360° twist orientation state is achieved, and it was thus impossible to
switch between the two metastable
