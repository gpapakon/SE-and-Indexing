<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flanging device (1) comprising an external flanging unit (6) and/or an internal flanging unit (7) as well as a clamping device (3). The clamping device (3) has one or more leading pressing and clamping elements (71) which are movable or deformable and can be adjusted in accordance with the place or time and/or force with which they act on the workpiece or workpieces (9). The pressing and clamping elements (71) are notably elastically deformable. They can also comprise a spring (72) or be fluidically pre-stressed.
