<ABSTRACT>
A thin film magnetic transducer (30) is formed in a 
plurality of layers and comprises a yoke (32) with at least one 

arm (36,38) having segments respectively lying in separate said 
layers and connected through a transition layer (B), and one or 

more coils; the coil (34) or (coils) and the yoke are intertwined 
to provide more than two flux interactions therebetween. In 

one aspect, the segments of the arm are oriented obliquely 
to each other and have easy axes of magnetization 

respectively transverse to the directions of flux conduction 
through said segments, and the segments are joined together 

so that flux can pass between them without flowing parallel 
to the easy axis of any of the segments.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thin film magnetic
transducers (i.e., heads).Referring to Fig. 1, a typical thin film magnetic
head 10 for writing information on or reading information
from a recording medium 12, such as a magnetic disk,
resembles a horseshoe-shaped yoke 14 of ferromagnetic
material (such as nickel-iron) around which a coil 16 is
wrapped. Yoke 14 includes a pair of pole pieces 18 the tips
of which are located closely adjacent to medium 12.Information is written on medium 12 by passing
electrical current through coil 16 to induce a corresponding
magnetic flux in yoke 14. The magnetic flux is conducted
through one of the pole pieces 18 to medium 12 via the tip
of the pole piece. Changes in the flux caused by varying
the electrical current are recorded as magnetic transitions
on medium 12. The flux circuit is completed by the return
of the magnetic flux to thin film head 10 via the other pole
piece. During reading, as head 10 is passed over a pair of
magnetic transitions 15, 16 (known as a di-bit) on medium
12, flux emanating from positive transition 15 is conducted
up through the one of the pole pieces 18 and returned by the
other pole piece to the negative transition 16. The flux
conduction through yoke 14 induces a corresponding
electrical signal in coil 16. The amount of flux imparted to the yoke during
writing by the coil depends upon the write current level,
the number of coil turns, and the reluctance of the pole,
among other factors. Similarly, the level of the voltage
induced in the coil during reading depends upon factors such
as the number of coil turns, the strength of the flux
presented to the coil as it travels through the yoke, and
the reluctance of the yoke. The flux-current relationship
in a magnetic head is termed the inductive coupling between
the yoke and the coil.Referring to Figs. 2A-2C, the ferromagnetic material
of the pole pieces 18 includes numerous microscopic regions,
called domains 20, within which magnetic dipoles 22 of the
material are aligned. The material is formed (by deposition
or annealing) in the presence of a directional magnetic
field to cause the dipoles 22 of some of the domains 20 to
become aligned with (i.e., oriented at an angle of 0 degrees
or 180 degrees to) the magnetic field direction. The
direction at which the dipoles are aligned represents the
preferred axis of magnetization of the pole piece and is
called the easy axis 24. The dipole alignment of the
domains in the interior of the material and the domains near
the edges of the material is such
