<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, a cloth (MA) unrolled from a rolled cloth (M) and spread and having at 
least laterally continuous patterns is fed downward with one longitudinal end thereof at the head via a feed means (4), 

and the surface of the downward extending portion of the cloth (MA) being fed downward is picked up by a CCD 
camera (5), an optical read means, the vertical position of the cloth (MA) being controlled on the basis of a signal 

from the CCd camera (5) so that the patterns on the cloth are lined up laterally, whereby it is rendered possible to carry 
out with very high reliability, accuracy and efficiency an operation, which has heretofore been found to be difficult 

to carry out, for matching the patterns on a cloth while removing curling such as skew and bend of the cloth by the 
weight of the cloth itself, and preventing the occurrence of imperfect products ascribed to the curling of the cloth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic fabric 
pattern-matching apparatus, and particularly to an 
automatic fabric pattern-matching apparatus with functions 
which are useful when a pattern formed on the 
fabric is continuous at least in a lateral direction, for 
example, when the pattern is a lateral stripe pattern, a 
lattice pattern, or the like. In recent years, fabrics of various materials have 
become commercially available as yard goods for European 
clothes, Japanese clothes, and the like. For example, a 
warp knitted fabric is generally produced as follows: A 
tubular knitted fabric is first dyed and finished, and 
then cut and unfolded. Thereafter, the fabric is wound on 
a core rod into a round form. In the case where a 
material fabric which is wound as described above is to 
be unwound for the purpose of tailoring, the fabric is 
drawn out from the wound fabric and cut into a predetermined 
size. Multiple fabrics thus obtained are piled up,  
 
and then cut out so as to have a desired shape by using 
a cutting device or the like. In this case, when the 
fabrics are piled up, it is necessary to perform the 
pattern matching for each of the fabrics. Particularly in 
the case where the pattern formed on the fabric is a 
stripe pattern or a lattice pattern, inaccurate pattern 
matching may result in poor products which include bias 
or bowed patterns or the like, or may result in undesired 
variations in pattern of products. In general, when such a fabric pattern matching is 
to be performed in the prior art, workers manually 
conduct the pattern matching carefully for each of 
fabrics so that the pattern on the fabric is not bowed, 
and the patterns are matched for all the piled fabrics. However, in the fabric on which the stripe pattern 
or the lattice pattern is formed as described above, 
there already exists a bias or bowed pattern or the like 
at some degree when the fabric is drawn out from the 
wound fabric. Such a bias or bowed pattern appears a kink 
on the drawn fabric. When the pattern matching is 
performed during the piling of fabrics, therefore, it is 
necessary to conduct a piling-up operation in which a 
number of workers pile the fabrics one by one while each 
of the workers confirms the pattern positions. Accordingly, 
an excess number of workers and labors are  
 
required, so that the operation is complicated and 
troublesome. This inevitably results in deterioration of 
operation efficiency and productivity. In addition, the 
above-described pattern matching is
