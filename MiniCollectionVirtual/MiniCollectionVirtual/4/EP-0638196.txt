<ABSTRACT>
An erasable optical disk (100K), for use with an erasable optical disk drive system, having a readout stimulation laser and a recording laser, is disclosed. The disk utilizes electron trapping optical memory material as the storage medium and comprises a disk substrate (10a), a layer of electron trapping optical memory material (14) coated on the disk substrate, a first light absorbing layer (120) coated on the layer of electron trapping optical memory material, a second light absorbing layer (122) coated on the first absorbing layer, and a reflective layer (20) coated on the second absorbing layer.

 Improved Optical Disk Structures For Electron Trapping Optical Memory MediaBackground of the InventionCross-Reference To Related Applications5 This application is a continuation in part of United States PatentApplication No. 07/449,005, filed December 12, 1989 and entitled "Optical Disk Structures for Electron Trapping Optical Memory Media. " The assignee is a related company to the assignee of United States Patent No. 4,864,536, issued September 5, 1989 and entitled "Optical Memory Method and System",10 United States Patent Application Serial No. 07/184,263, filed April 21, 1988 and entitled "Thin Film Photoluminescent Articles and Method of Making Same", United States Patent Application Serial No. 07/ 225, 846, filed July 29, 1988 and entitled "Optical Disk Drive System", United States Patent Application Serial No. 07/277,255, filed November 29, 1988 and entitled15 "Three Dimensional Optical Memory". Reference is also made to commonly assigned United States Patent Application Serial No. 07/449,002, filed December 12, 1989 and entitled "Three Laser Optical Disk Drive System".Background Of The InventionThe present invention relates to disks for use with optical mass storage20 devices for data storage. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for constructing an erasable optical disk for mass data or information storage which performs all of the erasing of data, in a purely photoelectric manner. »>Optical storage devices for use in storing computer and other data are25 presently known in the art. Such devices are desirable because of their ability to store vastly more information per disk than known magnetic disk storage devices. While most of the known optical disk drive devices perform read¬ only functions, write-once-read-many times (WORM) and erasable optical 

memory systems are also known. However, heretofore, erasable optical memory systems have encountered much greater developmental difficulty than the read-only or WORM systems, due in part to the increased technical complexity of the characteristics of the disk media itself. In order to overcome the problems of prior art erasable optical disk drives, a related company to the assignee of the present invention has developed a new approach to the optical storage materials which provide the storage function of the erasable optical disk drive. This development utilizes the phenomenon known as electron trapping in a class of materials which comprise an alkaline earth chalcogenide crystal typically doped with rare
