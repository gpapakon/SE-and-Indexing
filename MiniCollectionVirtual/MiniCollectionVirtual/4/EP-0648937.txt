<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid machine with
an induction motor, and more particularly to a fluid machine
having many types of design points which can be operated by the
same induction motor.Heretofore, a voltage and a frequency to be supplied
to a motor are uniquely determined at a site where the motor is
used. In order to enable the motor to be common use, it has
been customary to provide a design point where shaft powers
(motor outputs) are the same and to vary a flow rate and a
produced pressure.FIG. 4 of the accompanying drawings shows the
relationship between a flow rate (Q) and a head (H) of a
conventional fluid machine with an induction motor. A pump,
for example, will be described as a non-positive displacement
fluid machine having such characteristics that the flow rate is
proportional to the rotational speed, the produced pressure is
proportional to the square of the rotational speed, and the
shaft power is proportional to the cube of the rotational
speed.A motor α is combined with a pump A at a flow rate Q
and a head H, a motor β is combined with a pump B at a flow
rate (1/K)Q and the head H, and the motor α is combined with a
pump C at the flow rate (1/K)Q and the head KH, thereby
handling three particular points. Thus, three particular 
points are handled by two types of motors and three types of
pumps.Various specifications at the particular points are
shown in FIG. 4.With the conventional fluid machine arrangement,
however, it is necessary to have a fluid machine available at
each of the particular points, as shown in FIG. 4, and a motor
can be shared only at the same output point. As a result, the
number of types of design points of a fluid machine is enormous
as compared with the number of types of motors used.Further information relating to the prior art is given by "World Pumps, no. 12,
December 1985, Morden, GB, pages 361-365" which relates to the effects of
variable speed controllers on electrical submersible pump performance. A
variable speed controller (VSC) is a solid-state power electronic device which,
when interposed between an electrical submersible pump (ESP) and its power
supply, can control the pump's hydraulic output by varying its speed. Said
document furthermore states that a fixed-frequency motor of a particular frame
size has a specified maximum output torque, provided that the correct voltage is
supplied to its terminals The same torque can be achieved at other speeds by
varying the voltage in proportion to the frequency. In this manner, the
magnetizing
