<ABSTRACT>
This actuator (1) for a control valve (2) has a control circuit which sets the actuator (1) in accordance with a desired value preset by a superior plant control system. In addition, it has a main piston (6) sliding in a main cylinder (5), with a drive volume (7), to which oil under pressure can be admitted in a controlled manner, on one side of the main piston (6), and a plate valve (17) connected upstream of the drive volume (7). An actuator for a control valve is to be created which can be improved in its dynamic behaviour with comparatively simple means. This is achieved by the plate valve (17) being provided with a separate storage volume, connected to a drain device, for the oil leaking from the plate valve (17).

<CLAIMS>
Actuating drive (1) for a control valve (2),
having a control circuit which sets the actuating drive

(1) to correspond with a specified required value from
an overriding installation control system, having a

main piston (6) sliding in a main cylinder (5), having
a drive volume (7), on one side of the main piston (6),

which is controlled by a proportional directional valve
(25) and can be acted on by oil under pressure, and

having a plate valve (17) connected between the drive
volume (7) and the proportional directional valve (25),

the plate valve (17) having a plate (18) which is held
against a seal seat (14b) by a compression spring (19)

in a spring space (20) in such a way that the drive
volume (7) is separated from the spring space (20),

characterized

in that the plate valve (17) is provided with a
reservoir volume (21, 24) connected to a drain

appliance (24a) and separate from the buffer volume (8)
of the actuating drive (1), for oil emerging from the

plate valve (17), and
in that the separate reservoir volume (21, 24) is
arranged concentrically around the spring space (20) of

the plate valve (17).
