<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a drawer guide (14) for drawers (12) which can be drawn out of the body of a piece of furniture (10), comprising a guide rail (18) on the body of said piece of furniture and a guide rail (16) on the drawer as well as two bearing members (26) which can be mounted on the body of the piece of furniture (10) and bear the guide rail (18) on the body of the piece of furniture. In order to improve said drawer guide such that the mounting of the closure mechanism is simplified, it is proposed that a front bearing member (26) be designed such that it positions a closure strip (42) in a defined manner in a position in which the drawers (12) are released and in a position in which the drawers (12) are locked, and that there be provided, on a front bearing member (26), a latching device (114) which can be latched with a latching element (106), moving on a track, of the closure strip (42) in one of the positions of the closure strip (42).
