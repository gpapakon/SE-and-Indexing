<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates generally to postage 
meters and more specifically it relates to a disposable 
postage stamp marker. Numerous postage meters have been provided in prior 
art that are machines used in bulk mailing to print the 
correct amount of postage on each piece of mail. While these 
units may be suitable for the particular purpose to which they 
address, they would not be as suitable for the purposes of the 
present invention. A primary feature is to provide a disposable postage 
stamp marker overcoming the shortcomings of the prior art 
devices, and which provides a disposable marker with a postage 
stamp imprinter having a porous stamp member to make visible 
impressions of, e.g. small official government seals on mail, 
to show that postage has been paid for the mail. Another feature is to provide a disposable postage 
stamp marker that after making a predetermined number of 
visible impressions, a built-in disabler will automatically be 
activated to deface the porous stamp member and destroy the 
integrity of the postage stamp imprinter, so that it cannot be 
used again and must be disposed of. A still further feature is to provide an economical 
disposable postage stamp marker that has a tamper proof self 
destruct feature, whereby if someone tries to break into the 
marker, the built-in disabler will be activated to deface the 
porous stamp member. According to one aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a disposable postage stamp marker which comprises a 
frame; means carried within the frame, for making a  
 
predetermined amount of visible impressions of small official 
government seal on mail to show that postage has been paid for 
the mail; and means carried within the frame and coupled to 
the visible impressions making means, for enumerating the 
predetermined amount of visible impressions that can be made; 
the frame incudes a chamber therein having an aperture 
therein; the visible impression making means is an imprinter 
operable through the aperture; counter means for the marker 
programmed to a pre-set limit; means for manually actuating 
the marker; and ink means associated with the marker; a porus 
stamp member associated with the ink means. A preferred form of the above is where there is 
included means carried within the frame and coupled between 
the postage stamp imprinter and the electronic module, for 
automatically preventing operation of the postage stamp 
imprinter when the pulse counter reaches the pre-set limit. Figure 1 is a bottom front

chamber (40) therein having an open bottom (42);
 

   said visible impression making means (22) is a 
postage stamp imprinter (44) operable through the open bottom 

(42) from within the chamber (40) in said frame (20); 
   said enumerating means (28) is an electronic module 

(46) secured within the chamber (40) in said frame (20) and 
includes: 

   a pulse counter (48) activated by said postage stamp 
imprinter (44) and programmed to a pre-set limit; and 

   a visual display unit (50) connected to said pulse 
counter (48) and positioned behind the window (34) in said 

front wall (32), to indicate remaining visible impressions 
(24) that can be made; 

   said frame (20) having a compartment (52) therein; 
   a battery (54) installed within said compartment 

(52) to electrically connect to said visual display unit (50) 
in said electronic module (46); 

   and a door (56) to cover said compartment (52) in 
said frame (20); 

   said frame (20) further includes a base (112) 
extending under the open bottom (42), so that said frame (20) 

can sit upon a flat surface (114); 
   an operable handle (60) pivotally mounted into said 

top wall (38), so that it can be depressed by a hand (62) of a 
person; 

   a stanchion (120) having a bore (122) in a lower end 
and pivotally mounted at an upper end to an underside of said 

handle (60), so as to extend downwardly therefrom; 
   a leg (98) slidably extending outwardly from within 

the bore (122) in the bottom end of said stanchion (120);

(98) connected to said first end (90) of said locking pall 

(88) located at a distal end of said telescopic arm (84) of 
said solenoid (82), so that when said telescopic arm (84) of 

said solenoid (82) is extended said stamp lock (96) will ride 
within said downwardly angled slot (80) in said housing (64) 

of said postage stamp imprinter (44) to raise said housing 
(64) into the chamber (40) of said frame (20), causing said 

second end (94) of said locking pall (88) to release said 
 

score marking assembly (86) and move directly under said

which will produce score lines (108) on a face of said porous 
stamp member (70), so as to prevent continued use of said 

porous stamp member (70); and 
   a bracket (110) extending downwardly from said 

extended portion (92) of said casing (78) and under said saw 
blades (106), so as to guide and support said saw blades (106)
