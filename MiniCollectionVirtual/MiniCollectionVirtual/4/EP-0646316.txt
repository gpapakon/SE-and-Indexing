<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel fungicides, 
including fungicidal compositions, and a method for controlling 
diseases of fruit and vegetables. More specifically, the 
invention relates to fungicidal extracellular polymers derived 
from fungi. Postharvest diseases of fruit and vegetables cause 15 
to 25% losses yearly in the fruit and vegetable industry 
worldwide. The major weapon in combatting and controlling these 
diseases is chemical fungicides. These are sometimes inadequate 
and are often hazardous to humans and to the environment. 
Therefore, there is a constant incentive and need to find 
effective alternative products to combat these diseases, 
preferably products derived from nature. It is known that by treating fruit and vegetables post-harvest 
with certain antagonistic microorganisms it is possible 
to control postharvest diseases. Among such antagonists, yeasts 
were reported to control postharvest diseases of fruit and 
vegetables, see Wilson and Wisniewski, Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 
27: 425-444 (1989), Droby et al., Postharvest News and 
Information 2: 169-173 (1991) and Wilson et al. U.S. Patent No. 
5, 
41,384. Another naturally derived fungicidal material is 
chitosan, a high molecular weight polysaccharide obtained from 
crab shell, which was reported to reduce decay in strawberries, 
see El Ghaouth et al., Phytopathol. 82: 389-4 
2 (1992),  It is an object of this invention to provide novel 
fungicides derived from natural sources. Another object of the 
invention is to provide fungicidal compositions for preventing 
and treating diseases in fruit and vegetables. It is a further 
object of this invention to provide fungicides derived from 
extracts of yeast and other fungi and fungicidal compositions 
containing them. Yet another object of this invention is to 
provide a method of preventing diseases in fruit and vegetables. 
Still another object of the invention is to provide a method of 
curing diseases in fruit and vegetables. A further object of 
the invention is to provide a method of preventing and treating 
postharvest diseases in fruit and vegetables. Another object of the invention is to provide a process 
for preparing fungicidal compositions. Other objects of the 
invention will appear from the description which follows. In accordance with this invention, there are thus 
provided novel fungicides for treating fruit and vegetables 
comprising extracellular polymers (EP) isolated from fungi. 
Thus, the fungicides of the invention may either consist 
essentially of
