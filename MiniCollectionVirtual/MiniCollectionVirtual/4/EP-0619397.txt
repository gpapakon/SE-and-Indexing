<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a depositing apparatus for laundry, 
for instance sheets, which deposits the sheet in a 

simple manner and with few moving and driven parts. 
A spread-out upper edge of the sheet (13) is blown against a 
conveyor belt (11) by means of a gust of air. A suction chamber (6,7,8) 

under the conveyor belt ensures that the sheet remains 
sucked against the conveyor belt until the sheet has been 

conveyed over a sufficient distance. 
In cross section the suction chamber is advantageously in 
the shape of a venturi, a blow pipe (4) ensuring an effective 

suction by blowing air through the venturi.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a depositing apparatus for depositing 
a piece of laundry, after spreading or stretching 
thereof, on an endless conveyor belt, which can supply the 
deposited piece of laundry to an apparatus placed downstream 
of it. Such an apparatus is known from applicant's European 
patent specification 161,716. This document discloses a 
depositing apparatus, wherein a piece of laundry is 
fetched by means of a movable collector rod, and is subsequently 
placed on the conveyor belt by means of a reeling 
unrolling rod which can move around the collector rod. The 
piece of laundry is supplied with two corner points, each 
in a clamp, the piece of laundry being spread or stretched 
in front of the conveyor belt (a similar apparatus is known from EP-A-0 345 087). The drawback to this known apparatus is that many moving 
and driven parts are necessary in order to deposit the 
laundry. This renders the apparatus complicated and expensive. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a 
depositing apparatus which is more easy to manufacture and 
thus less expensive. According to the invention this is achieved with the 
measures, that the conveyor belt comprises a number of air 
passage openings, and that suction means are provided 
below the upper surface of the conveyor belt, for sucking 
in air through the upper surface of the conveyor belt, to  
 
suck the piece of laundry against the conveyor belt, said 
suction means comprising at least one chamber-like space 
having an open upper side and a discharge side, at least 
two facing sides of the chamber-like space defining a 
venturi. As a consequence, the supplied and spread-out piece of 
laundry will be sucked against the conveyor belt, without 
moving and driven means being required to deposit the 
piece of laundry. As a result of the action of the venturi, the suction 
means will suck the piece of laundry effectively. The suction means advantageously comprise at least one 
first blow pipe having openings, which first blow pipe is 
arranged for cooperation with the venturi. Because the first blow pipe blows the air through the 
discharge side of the chamber-like space, air is sucked 
out of the chamber-like space and the piece of laundry is 
sucked against the conveyor belt. It is advantageous to dispose the first blow pipe in or 
above the narrowing upper portion of the venturi. Hereby a more effective suction is obtained. In order to obtain sufficient suction, the sides of the 
narrowing part of the venturi define an angle of

Depositing apparatus for depositing a piece of laundry 
(13), after spreading or stretching thereof, on an endless 

conveyor belt (11), which can supply the deposited piece 
of laundry (13) to an apparatus placed downstream of it, 

wherein the conveyor belt (11) comprises a number of air 
passage openings, and suction means are provided below the 

upper surface of the conveyor belt (11), for sucking in 
air through the upper surface of the conveyor belt (11), 

to suck the piece of laundry (13) against the conveyor 
belt (11), 
characterized in that
 the suction means 
comprise at least one chamber-like space having an open 

upper side and a discharge side, at least two facing sides 
(7; 6, 8) of the chamber-like space defining a venturi.  

 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the suction 
means comprise at least one first blow pipe (9) hav
ing 
openings, which first blow pipe is arranged for cooperation 

with the venturi. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the first blow 
pipe (9) is disposed in or above the narrowing upper part 

of the venturi. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the sides of 
the narrowing part of the venturi define an angle of 

between 20° and 70°, and preferably 40°, with respect to 
each other, and the sides of the widening part of the 

venturi define an angle of between 6° and 30°, and preferably  
 

12°, with respect to each other, and the narrowing of 
the venturi is between 10 and 25 mm, and preferably 15 mm, 

wide. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the first blow 
pipe (9) is disposed centrally between the walls of the 

upper part of the chamber-like space, at a distance of 
between 40 mm and 150 mm, and preferably 90 mm, above the 

narrowing of the venturi, and the openings in the first 
blow pipe (9) are round and have a diameter of 1 mm, and 

are arranged at a distance of less than 35 mm, and preferably 
18 mm, from each other. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the chamber-like space forms a wall for collecting 

loose textile particles and for guiding these particles to 
the discharge side of the venturi, which defines an open 

bottom side of the chamber-like space. 
Apparatus according to one of the claims 2 - 6, wherein 
holes (18) are provided in at least one wall of the narrowing 

upper part of the chamber-like space, to allow air 
to flow gradually into the chamber-like space when switching 

off the supply of pressurized air, so that the 
deposited piece of laundry remains flat.
