<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for the sequential firing of electrical detonators in several firing circuits, the device consisting of a detonating machine, electric leads and switches for activating the firing circuits. The detonating machine (1) is connected by a lead (2) to an electronic firing switch (3) to which are connected the firing circuits (13a... 13n) which consist of one or more series-connected electrical detonators (14a... 14n) and explosive charges (4a... 4n) designed to be detonated by the detonators, the electronic firing switch (3) consisting of a firing-current detection circuit (7), a logic circuit (8), switching relays (10a... 10n), a power supply (9) and protective resistors (11a... 11n).

<CLAIMS>
A device for sequential firing of electrical detonators, comprising a source of current, 
electrical leads (2) and change-over switches (3) for activating detonating circuits. 

characterised in that firing apparatus (1) is connected by way of a lead (2) to an 
electronic firing change-over switch (3), to which are connected the detonating circuits 

(13a . . .13n), comprising a detonator or several electrical detonators (14a . . . 14n) 
connected in series and explosive charges (4a . . . 4n) fireable by the said detonators, and 

the electronic detonator change-over switch (3) comprises a firing current detection 
circuit (7), a logic circuit (8), change-over relays (10a . . . 10n), a source of current (9) 

and protective resistors (11a . . . 11n). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that a low voltage battery (9) is used as 
the current source of the detonator change-over switch (3) and protective 

resistors (11a. . .11n) are provided to restrict an arising fault current to a value which is 
no higher than 1/3 of the non-striking current of the electrical detonators (14a . . .14n). 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that in order to prevent bridging of 
the protective resistors (11a . . .11n) in the event of a fault, the battery (9) and the 

protective resistors (11a . . .11n) are housed separately in a container part (18) and a 
container part (19) respectively.
