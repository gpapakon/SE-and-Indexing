<ABSTRACT>
The fixator comprises a link rod (4) provided with a first part (4a) which interacts with clamping means (7) provided on pedicle screws (3) and a second part (4b), with smaller diameter than the first, which slides freely in guide means (5, 5') in order to allow reduction of the forces applied to the disc of the vertebra lying just above the last vertebra instrumented by means of the fixator (2).

Fixing member for osteosynthesis of the sacrolumbar
spine, comprising two substantially parallel assemblies

for fusing the damaged vertebral stages of a spinal
column, each assembly comprising grub screws (3), a

connecting rod (4) between the screws and gripping means
(7) for holding the rod, characterised in that the

connecting rod (4) has a first part (4
a
) which co-operates
with the gripping means (7) provided on the

grub screws (3), a second part (4
b
) smaller in diameter
than the first, and in that the fixing member comprises

guide means (5, 5') adapted so that said second part of
the connecting rod slides freely therein, so as to allow

the releif of the forces which are borne by the disc of
the vertebra (1
a
) located just above the last vertebra
(1
a
) secured by the fixing member (2).
Fixing member according to claim 1, characterised
in that the guide means (5) consists of a ring screw

(5
a
) comprising a head (5
b
) drilled with a bore (5
e
)
having two lateral notches (5
f
) for the positioning of a
disc (5
j
) in which is drilled a dished hole (5
k
) for
accommodating the second part (4
b
) of the rod (4),
whilst the disc (5
j
) is secured against rotation inside
the bore (5
e
) by a pressure screw (5
i
).
Fixing member according to claim 2, characterised
in that the bore (5
e
) has an internal profile shaped
like a portion of a sphere.
Fixing member according to claim 2, characterised
in that the disc (5
j
) has an external profile identical
to that of the bore (5
e
) to form a ball-and-socket
joint.
Fixing member according to claim 2, characterised
in that the disc (5
j
) is drilled with a first hole (5
k
) 
having a dished profile and a second hole (5
l
) which is
smaller in diameter.
Fixing member according to claim 2, characterised
in that the ring screw (5) comprises a rod (5
c
) provided
with a self-tapping thread (5
d
).
Fixing member according to claim 1, characterised
in that the guide means (5') consist of symmetrical

discs (5'
a
) each of which is provided with a through-bore
(5'
d
) which is conical in profile and of at least
one notch (5'
e
) which is formed perpendicularly to said
bore and inside which is provided, in the centre, a

groove (5'
f
) for retaining a Nylon ring (5'
g
) which
comprises a ball-and-socket (5'
h
) in which is drilled a
through-hole for the sliding of the second part (4
b
) of
the connecting rod (4).
Fixing member according to claim 7, characterised
in that the discs (5'
a
) are secured to a grub screw (3)
by a nut (6).
Fixing member according to claim 7, characterised
in that the groove (5'
f
) has a V-shaped profile.
Fixing member according to claim 7, characterised
in that the grub screw (3) comprises a self-tapping

thread (3
a
) and a spherical head (3
b
) which is fixedly
connected at its upper end, coaxially with said thread,

to a threaded rod (3
c
) of variable height, whereas the
spherical head (3
b
) has, in its inner part, a conical
profile (3
e
) the surface of which is rough so as to
allow the bone to take.
