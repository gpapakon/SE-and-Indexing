<ABSTRACT>
In order to achieve a smooth and gentle mode of operation, even at high operating speeds, in a sheet deliverer which has a stacking table (15) and a conveyor-belt system (1) arranged upstream of the latter, a perforated belt system (8) is provided, which overlaps the stacking-table end of the conveyor belt system (1) and the stacking table (15), can be driven at a variable speed, and whose perforated belts (9) in each case cover an assigned suction-air duct (19) which is connected to a suction-air generator (21) at its end facing the conveyor belt system. The drive motor (14) assigned to the perforated belts (9) is greatly accelerated after a sheet drops off and is decelerated again after a sheet has been picked up. Provided for this purpose is a sensor (22) which is adjustable in the running direction of the sheets.

<CLAIMS>
Device for depositing sheets on a pile table (15) provided 
with pile stops (16, 17), with a conveyor belt 

system (1) comprising a plurality of endless parallel 
conveyor belts (2) driven at the same speed and carrying 

the individual sheets at intervals on its upper 
side, [with]
 a perforated belt system (8) which overlaps 
the end of the conveyor belt system (1) and comprises 

a plurality of endless parallel perforated 
belts (9) which can be driven by a motor (14), and 

which extends over the pile table (15), [with] a 

plurality of suction ducts (19) each located above the 
lower strand of a perforated belt (9) and opening only 

towards the perforated belt, [and with] an aspirator 

(21) connected to the conveyor belt system ends of the 
suction ducts (19) and producing a suction airflow 

lowering the air pressure in the suction ducts (19), 
characterized in that the motor drives the perforated 

belts (9) at variable speed, and a motor control sensor 
(22) is also provided, which responds to the leading 

edge of the sheet and the release of the sheet by the 
perforated belt system (8) and which can be set, in the 

feed direction of the sheets, to a distance from the 
start of the suction ducts (19) which is less than the 

length of the sheets, and by means of which the motor 
(14) together with the perforated belt system (8) can 

alternately be accelerated to a high conveying speed 
following the release of a sheet, and slowed again 

following detection of the leading edge of a sheet. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
speed of the motor (14) and the perforated belt system 

(8) can be reduced to zero.  
 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
conveying speed of the perforated belt system (8) is 

approximately equal to the belt speed of the conveyor 
belt system (1). 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the conveyor belts (2) are 

laterally offset with respect to the perforated belts 
(9). 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least one air blower (24), 

located above the perforated belt system (8) and 
temporarily blowing air under pressure on to the upper 

side of a sheet, is provided. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a fixed sheet leading edge sensor 

(30) and a sheet trailing edge sensor (31) which is adjustable 
to the length of the sheets are provided above 

the conveyor belt system (1), and the sheet trailing 
edge sensor (31) is coupled with the motor control 

sensor (22), and preferably at least one associated 
pile stop, for sheet length adjustment, the sheet trailing 

edge sensor (31) and the motor control sensor (22) 
preferably being arranged on two supports (32, 33) 

coupled to one another by a common drive mechanism 
causing them to move in opposite directions. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that two sheet lateral edge sensors 

(39, 40), each detecting one lateral edge of the sheet, 
are arranged above the conveyor belt system (1) and 

these sheet lateral edge sensors (39, 40) are coupled 
together, preferably with the pile lateral stops and  

 
if required with lateral stops located in the region of 

the conveyor system (1), so that the two sheet lateral 
edge sensors (39, 40) move in opposite directions, the 

two sheet lateral edge sensors (39, 40) preferably 
being arranged on two supports (41, 42) coupled 

together by a common drive mechanism causing them to 
move in opposite directions. 
Device according to Claim 6 or Claim 7, characterized 
in that the sensors (22, 30, 31, 39, 40) are reflected-light 

switches. 
Device according to any one of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that when the device is in operation 

the sensors (30, 31, 39, 40) above the conveyor belt 
system (1) are activatable in a timed cycle as each 

sheet passes through the device, and upon detecting a 
defective sheet give a signal to switch on a sheet 

diverter (49) which carries the defective sheet to a 
specimen delivery rack (56) and is preferably manually 

activatable for the removal of specimen sheets, and 
which preferably has at least one belt conveyor (50) 

below the upper side of the conveyor belts (2) and 
pivotable about the axis of an end pulley (51) and at 

least one further belt conveyor (52) above the upper 
side of the conveyor belts (2) and pivotable about the 

axis of an end pulley, [the said belt conveyors (50, 
52)]
 being pivotable into a position in which an intake 
funnel is formed. 
Device according to any one of Claims 6 to 9, 
characterized in that [the]
 motor control sensor (22) 
is additionally adjustable in the sheet feed direction, 

or in the opposite direction thereto, to accommodate 
different weights of paper.
