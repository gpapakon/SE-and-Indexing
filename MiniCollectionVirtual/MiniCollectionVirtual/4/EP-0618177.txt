<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a glass forming 
composition for encapsulating selenium which includes, by 

weight percent of raw materials, 20 to 50% silica and 50 to 
80% alkali and alkaline earth materials. The composition has 

a liquidus temperature between 600 to 1200°C, preferably up to 
1000°C, and a viscosity up to 10,000 Poise at said liquidus 

temperature, preferably up to 5,000 Poise. The alkali and 
alkaline materials preferably include at least one group of 

materials combined in an approximate eutectic molar ratio. In 
one particular embodiment of the invention, the alkali and 

alkaline earth materials include groups of nitrates, such as 
KNO₃, NaNO₃ and/or Ca(NO₃)₂, and/or carbonates, such as K₂CO₃, 

Na(CO₃)₂ and/or Li₂CO₃.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of selenium 
for incorporation into a glass batch. Selenium is an important additive for making various 
heat absorbing and colored glass. It has been used in the 
glass industry for more than 100 years to produce colors from 
pink to red to blue and even as a de-colorizing agent by compensating 
for the blue green color resulting from the incorporation 
of ferrous (Fe²⁺) material. Its desirable coloring 
properties and long history of wide spread use, however, do 
not speak of the difficulties involved in its utilization. Selenium is considered one of the most expensive 
components of a soda lime silica glass batch. Fortunately, 
only parts per million (PPM) levels are needed for most 
coloring needs. However, concerns about selenium's extreme 
volatility outweigh the small amounts required for coloration. The volatilization of selenium and its compounds are 
of important technological significance to glass makers. 
According to conventional practice, in most cases the selenium, 
in the form of metal or selenium compounds, is mixed and 
melted with other total amounts of the raw materials for the 
glass. Selenium losses of nearly 85% are common in glass 
production facilities. Selenium is so thermally unstable that 
volatilization for the metallic state begins at about 200°C 
(which is below its melting point of 217°C). The economic and 
corresponding environmental costs of selenium volatility are 
therefore of great concern. There are only two forms of selenium which produce 
color in soda lime silica glass, namely, selenium in its 
elemental state (Seo) and polyselenide state (Sex²⁻). The 
neutral form creates a pink color whereas the polyselenide's 
contribution depends on the associated species, for example, 
FeSe produces red brown color. The other possible forms of 
selenium in the vitreous state, Se²⁻, Se⁴⁺ and Se⁶⁺ are colorless.  
 
Glass redox, therefore, will have great influence on 
the final color of the glass. Clearly the problems associated 
with selenium go beyond just its retention in the melt and 
must address the efficient development of the correct color of 
the final glass product. As a starting point, however, selenium 
must be retained before dealing with the resulting color. One method of retaining selenium is to combine the 
selenium with either glass cullet or a portion of the glass 
batch material and sinter the resulting mixture as disclosed 
in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,291,585 and 3,628,932. The sintered 
material is then recombined with
