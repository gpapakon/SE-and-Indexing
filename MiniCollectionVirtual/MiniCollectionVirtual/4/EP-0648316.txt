<ABSTRACT>
A system for connecting two parts (1, 2) by means of a pin (7) positioned axially in recesses in said parts. The pin (7) and one of the recesses (10) have a non-circular cross section, and the pin (7) is held by the force of a spring wire (11) to reduce its play in said recess (10).

<CLAIMS>
Device for connecting a yoke (1) and a caliper (2) of a sliding caliper 
disk-brake, comprising first and second housings (9, 10) of common axis (8) formed 

respectively in the yoke (1) and the caliper (2), a key (7) inserted axially into the first 
housing with a relatively small clearance and into the second housing with a relatively 

large clearance, and a retaining member (11) for the key (7) characterized in that the 
retaining member is made out of a wire spring and in that the second housing and the 

key adopt at least partially the form of cylinders with non-circular bases each of which 
has different minimal and maximal diameters, the diameters of the second housing being 

greater than the corresponding diameters of the key and the maximal diameter (DM) of 
the latter being greater than the minimal diameter of the second housing, the retaining 

member (11), resting on two points (11b, 1a) of one of the two parts and exerting on 
the key a resilient torsional torque about said common axis, tending to align the maximal 

diameter (DM) of the key and the minimal diameter of the second housing. 
Connection device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the wire 
spring (11) is secured to the key and to the yoke respectively at first and second 

attachment points (11a, 11b) spaced apart from one another by a portion of length of 
this wire extending at least partially in a direction different from that of said common 

axis (8) so as to be subjected to a flexion during a sliding of the caliper resulting from a 
braking action, and so as thus to be capable of bringing the latter back at the end of this 

action. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the first attachment 
point (11a) is obtained by inserting the wire spring into a transverse bore (7c) made in 

the key. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the wire spring is angled 
at the exit from said transverse bore, in that it is pressed onto the yoke at a point of 

rotation (1a) situated, along the length of this wire, between the first and second 
attachment points, and in that the second attachment point is situated apart from the 

plane formed by said common axis and said point of rotation.
