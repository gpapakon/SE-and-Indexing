<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic filter
useful for removing a dust from a dust-containing gas,
particularly from a high temperature dust-containing gas,
and a method for its production.Ceramics are usually excellent in refractoriness and
corrosion resistance and suitable as materials for
filters for high temperature or corrosive gasses. On the
other hand, there is an increasing need for ceramic
filters which can be used under severe environmental
conditions.Their applications cover not only pollution control
or improvement of the quality of products but also saving
of energy or development of an energy such as coal.
Therefore, it is desired to develop a high performance
ceramic filter for a dust-containing gas, which is a key
to accomplish these technical developments. When a filter is to be used at a high temperature,
rapid heating or quenching is often unavoidable.
Therefore, a material having a small thermal expansion
coefficient which is strong against thermal shock, is
required.Among various types of ceramics, a cordierite
ceramics has a particularly small thermal expansion
coefficient and is a material strong against thermal
shock. By utilizing this properties, a cordierite filter
for high temperature use has been developed for a certain
specific purpose.For example, JP-A-52133810
discloses a cordierite ceramic filter and
a method for its production, wherein a honeycomb type
filter is discussed which has a pore size suitable for
removing fine particulates in an exhaust gas from a
diesel engine, and a method is disclosed for producing a
cordierite ceramic filter having a relatively large
average pore size. Further, it is disclosed to add an
alkaline component such as a lithium oxide component for
the purpose of forming relatively large pores.
Further, as described in JP-A-63031517, one of
the present inventors has previously proposed a
tubular cordierite filter having a pore size
distribution hardly susceptible to clogging, for the 
purpose of removing a dust from a high temperature dust-containing
gas. As the filter, the smaller the pressure
loss, the better, since it is thereby possible to obtain
a large capacity filter apparatus for treating the dust-containing
gas. For this purpose, the larger the
porosity, the better. However, there is a problem that
the strength decreases substantially when the porosity is
increased. It is therefore common to find out a
compromise point and produce a filter on the basis of
such a compromise.With respect to alumina and silicon carbide which
have been
