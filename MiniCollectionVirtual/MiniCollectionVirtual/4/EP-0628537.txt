<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial 
No. 214,702 filed July 1, 1988 and relates to a low temperature 
process for making rare earth-barium-copper oxide 
superconductors and their precursors. Bednorz and Muller, Z. Phys. B64, 189 (1986), disclose 
a superconducting phase in the La-Ba-Cu-O system with a 
superconducting transition temperature of about 35 K. The 
presence of this phase was subsequently confirmed by a number of 
investigators [see, for example, Rao and Ganguly, Current Science, 
56, 47 (1987), Chin et al., Science, 235, 567 (1987), Chin et al., 
Phys. Rev. Lett., 58, 405 (1987), Cava et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 58, 
408 (1987), Bednorz et al., Europhys. Lett., 3, 379 (1987)]. The 
superconducting phase has been identified as the composition 
La1-x(Ba,Sr,Ca)xO4-y with the tetragonal K₂NiF₄-type structure and 
with x typically about 0.15 and y indicating oxygen vacancies. Wu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 58, 908 (1987), disclose a 
superconducting phase in the Y-Ba-Cu-O system with a 
superconducting transition temperature of about 90 K. The 
compounds investigated were prepared with nominal compositions 
(Y1-xBax)₂CuO4-y and x = 0.4 by a solid-state reaction of appropriate 
amounts of Y₂O₃, BaCO₃ and CuO in a manner similar to that 
described in Chu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 58, 405 (1987). This 
reaction method comprised heating the oxides in a reduced oxygen  
 
atmosphere of 2x10⁻⁵ bars (2 Pa) at 900°C for 6 hours. The reacted 
mixture was pulverized and the heating step was repeated. The 
thoroughly reacted mixture was then pressed into 3/16 inch (0.5 
cm) diameter cylinders for final sintering at 925°C for 24 hours in 
the same reduced oxygen atmosphere. Hundreds of other papers have since disclosed similar 
solid state reaction processes. Other papers have disclosed various 
solution and precipitation methods for preparing the reactants to 
be heated at temperatures of 800-850°C and above. Hirano et al., Chemistry Letters, 665, (1988), disclose a 
process for producing Y-Ba-Cu-O superconductors by the partial 
hydrolysis of a solution of Ba metal, Y(O-iPr)₃ and 
Cu-acetylacetonate or Cu-alkoxides in 2-methoxy or 2-ethoxy 
ethanol. The solution was stirred in dry nitrogen and heated at 
60°C for 12 hours. The solution was then hydrolyzed by the slow 
addition of water diluted with solvent. Stirring and heating 
continued for several hours. Stirring continued while the solution 
was evaporated under vacuum at about 60°C and an amorphous 
precursor powder was obtained. The
