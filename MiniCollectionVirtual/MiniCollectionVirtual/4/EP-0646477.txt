<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dispensers for sheets
from a coherent stack of sheets, each sheet bearing a
band of pressure-sensitive adhesive, such as a
repositionable pressure-sensitive adhesive, by which it
can be self-adhered to a variety of surfaces. The
invention is particularly related to such dispensers
which have a low profiles so that they can be adhered
to an inside page of a magazine, catalog, notebook,
personal organizer or the like without creating an
unsightly bulge.Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company or 3M
(the company to which this application is assigned) has
developed a rather low profile dispenser for a stack of
paper sheets that is described in co-assigned U.S.
Patent No. 5,158,205 (Bodziak et al.). In Figures 1-6
of the Bodziak patent, a dispenser made of folded card
stock forms a chamber closely containing a stack (12)
of paper sheets. Centrally across the top wall (22)
of that dispenser is a slot (30) through which paper
sheets can be successively pulled from the stack. Each
of the sheets has a narrow band of repositionable
pressure-sensitive adhesive (14) coated on one surface
adjacent one edge. When the uppermost sheet of the
stack is pulled through the slot, flanking slits (24)
at each end of the slot allow one of two opposed flap-like
portions (28) of the top wall to flex as shown in
Figure 4 while the other flap-like portion places a
drag on the next sheet so that the uppermost sheet will
peel away from the next sheet. The pop-up dispenser of the Bodziak patent is
being used for coherent stacks of Post-it (TM) brand
self-stick repositionable notes that consist of pieces
of paper, each having a narrow band of repositionable
pressure-sensitive adhesive coated on one surface
adjacent one edge. Among a variety of other pop-up
dispensers that have been described in the art for use
with coherent stacks of Post-it (TM) brand self-stick
repositionable notes are those disclosed in co-assigned
U.S. Patents Nos. 4,416,392 (Smith), 4,653,666
(Mertens), 5,080,255 (Windorski), 5,165,570 (Windorski
et al), 5,167,346 (Bodziak et al) and 5,158,205
(Bodziak et al). Figures 1-13 of U.S. Patent No.
5,165,570 illustrate dispensers having a base surface
bearing a pair of foam-backed pressure-sensitive
adhesive strips covered with a release liner by which
the dispenser can be adhesively anchored to a
substrate.The European patent application filed on August 2, 1994 under
N° 94401776.3 and which corresponds to U.S. Patent Application
N° 08/101,615 filed
August 3, 1993,
