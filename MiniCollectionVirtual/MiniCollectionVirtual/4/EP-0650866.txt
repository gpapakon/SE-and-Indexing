<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for removing a vehicle from a parking space is proposed, in which parking space neither the size nor the distance from obstacles is known. By means of sensors attached to the vehicle, both the distance and the steering angle of the moving vehicle are detected and the distance from the surrounding objects is continuously determined. On the basis of the data, an instantaneous local map of the surroundings is produced in a computer module. The detected obstacles are connected using a polygonal progression as a barrier. A model of surroundings is produced from these data and used to determine a driving strategy for removing the vehicle from the parking space. Appropriate travel direction indicators indicate the travel direction to the driver of the vehicle.

Method for driving a vehicle out of a parking 
space, the distance to the obstacle in the direction of 

travel being measured by means of sensors fitted to the 
vehicle, and having a controller which determines a 

driving strategy for the vehicle from the measured 
distances, characterized in that the controller (10), 

with the aid of the measured values, forms a local 
environment map (45) in the area of the vehicle (42), in 

which map spatial data and data about the obstacles (41) 
are plotted, and in that the controller (10), with the 

aid of the environment map, determines a model of the 
environment with which the driving strategy for the 

driving-out procedure is defined. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, during the driving-out procedure, the model of the 

environment is updated by means of data signals emitted 
by sensors, the sensor data being logically linked with 

the vehicle data in such a way that an open polygon (44) 
for the model of the environment is generated from the 

combination of the segment boundaries of the detected 
obstacles. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the driving strategy is adapted to the up-to-date 

model of the environment from the beginning until the 
completion of the driving-out procedure. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the driving-out procedure is 

started with an incomplete description of the obstacles 
in the model. 
Device for carrying out the method according to  
 

one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
device has a controller (10), the controller (10) is 

connected at least to one sensor (S

) for detecting an obstacle in relation to the vehicle 

position, in that the controller has means (4, 6) for 
forming the local environment map and the model of the 

environment, and in that an indicator (9) is provided 
which is designed to emit visual or acoustic control 

instructions to the driver of the vehicle, these instructions 
being derived from the model of this environment. 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that if the distance falls below a prescribed minimum, a 

visual or acoustic warning signal may be emitted.
