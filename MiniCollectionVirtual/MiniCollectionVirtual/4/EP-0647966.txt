a step of simultaneous forming of a wiring pattern in a 

functional circuit module and a dummy wiring pattern in a 
region close to the functional circuit module.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device and 
a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device. In a conventional semiconductor device as shown in Fig. 
3, a functional module 2 having wirings 3 is formed on a 
semiconductor substrate 1, e.g. silicon substrate. It is 
quite general to obtain such wiring patterns by performing 
a reactive ion etching (RIE) method using reactive gas, 
e.g. CF₄. Recent progress in miniaturization and integration of 
semiconductor has reduced width Lw (See Fig. 3) of wirings. 
Accordingly, in the case that wiring patterns are formed 
by RIE, there causes difference in sectional pattern 
configuration between portions at or near the end 3C of the 
wiring 3 which is near to sparse region 4 and at or near 
the inner part 3B of the wiring 3. More specifically, a 
sectional pattern configuration at the part 3B near inner 
part of the wiring shows a normal sectional pattern 
configuration as shown in Fig. 4 which is a sectional view 
along the line B-B. However, sectional pattern configuration 
at the end 3C of the wiring shows large side etching 
(See Fig. 5) which results in smaller dimension comparing 
to a desired width Lw (See Fig. 3). Such phenomenon can be explained as follows: In the 
case of forming wiring patterns using the RIE method, 
firstly a photoresist pattern 6 is formed by resist 
application and photoengraving then the wiring layer is 
etched by reactive ions using the photoresist pattern as 
an etching mask. At the part 3B near inner part, sides of 
the wiring patterns 3 are covered by protective side walls 
against etching. The protective side walls are compound 
(for example carbide) films 7 which are generated by 
reaction between reactive ions 8 and photoresist 6 as shown 
in Fig. 6. In contrast, at the end part 3C, since the part  
 
is close to sparse region 4, amount of the compound is 
small because reaction between the reactive ions 8 and the 
photoresist 6 is not go active. Accordingly the sides of 
the wiring patterns are not perfectly covered by the 
compound resulting in generating non-covered portions or 
spacing G from where the etching proceeds. Thus side etchings occurred in the wiring patterns may 
cause an electromigration, reduction of reliability, 
deterioration in characteristics, and decrease in yield. 
Furthermore, the adverse effect of the side etching becomes 
serious especially for patterns having width of submicron 
(which is under 1 micrometer) order because the more 
develops the miniaturization the less becomes the
