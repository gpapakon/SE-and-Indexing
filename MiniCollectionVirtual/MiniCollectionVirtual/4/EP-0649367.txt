<ABSTRACT>
In order to remove toxic substances from timber for disposal, the timber is ground and a suspension of water, a water-soluble organic solvent and the ground timber is centrifuged in a centrifuge (2). The mixture or water and solvent is extracted from the centrifuge (2) and, after the toxic substances in the mixture have been separated and the organic solvent has been distilled off from the water, the water is reintroduced into the circuit of the centrifuge (2) in order to form a fresh suspension of water, organic solvent and the timber (12) separated in the centrifuge (2). This process is repeated until the timber (12) has been freed from toxic substances.

A method for disposing of wood treated with toxic inorganic 
and organic substances, whereby a heated suspension 

of water, a water-soluble organic solvent with a lower boiling 
point than water and the shredded wood to be disposed of 

or reused is centrifuged in a centrifuge, the mixture of water 
and the organic solvent removed from the centrifuge and 

cooled and the sparingly soluble inorganic substances contained 
therein thereby separated, and after the organic solvent 

is separated by distillation from the water, the toxic 
organic substances being separated as distillation bottoms 

during said separation by distillation, the water and organic 
solvent are refed to the centrifuge in the circuit for new 

formation of a suspension of water, organic solvent and the 
wood separated in the centrifuge until the wood is freed from 

the toxic substances, and finally after the mixture of water 
and organic solvent is removed the wood separated in the centrifuge 

and freed from toxic substances is discharged from 
the centrifuge. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the 
shredded wood is fed to the centrifuge as pulp. 
The method of one of the above claims, characterized 
in that the organic solvent is acetone or alcohol. 
The method of one of the above claims, characterized 
in that a heat pump is used for cooling the mixture of water 

and organic solvent and for heating the mixture of water and 
organic solvent for the separation by distillation of the organic 

solvent. 
The method of one of the above claims, characterized 
in that the mixture of water and organic solvent is filtered 

with a filter after removal from the centrifuge. 
The method of one of the above claims, characterized 

in that the wood separated in the centrifuge and freed from 
toxic substances is discharged by flushing out with water.  

 
The method of one of the above claims, characterized 
in that the suspension is pressurized in the centrifuge. 
A plant for carrying out the method of one of the 
above claims having a centrifuge (2) with a heating device 

for centrifuging the suspension of water, the organic solvent 
and the shredded wood; a cooling device for cooling the mixture 

of water and organic solvent removed from the centrifuge; 
a settling tank (16) for the cooled mixture of water 

and organic solvent removed from the centrifuge (2), for 
separating inorganic substances; a distillation device (21) 

for distilling the solvent off the water and separating organic 
substances in the water; and return pipes (3, 4) for 

the organic solvent and the water, respectively, from the 
distillation device (21) to the centrifuge (2). 
The plant of claim 8, characterized in that a heat 
pump is provided for cooling the mixture of water and organic 

solvent and for heating the distillation device and/or the 
suspension in the centrifuge (2). 
The plant of claim 9, characterized in that the heat 
pump is driven by a combustion engine whose waste heat is 

used for heating the distillation device and/or the suspension 
in the centrifuge (2). 
The plant of one of claims 9 to 10, characterized in 
that a filter (10) is provided in a filter chamber (8) between 

the centrifuge (2) and the settling tank (16). 
The plant of claim 11, characterized in that a pipe 
(13) is provided for cleaning the filter (10), being connected 

to the filter chamber (9) upstream of the filter (10) 
and leading back in the circuit to the centrifuge (2).
