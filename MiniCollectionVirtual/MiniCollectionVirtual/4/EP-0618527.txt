<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display includes a plurality of 
capacitors which apply electric fields to liquid crystal 

material located between the capacitor plates. Each capacitor 
is associated with a sensor which detects the presence of a 

hand-held stylus. The detection can be done optically, 
acoustically, by pressure, by temperature, or by other means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid crystal display devices.
Figure 1 illustrates nine pixels of a Liquid-Crystal Display
(LCD). Each box labeled DEVICE represents one of the LCD
elements. Each LCD element is called a pixel. The transistors
labeled MOS turn their respective pixels on and off.The operation of the LCD can be explained, in a very
simplified manner, as follows. In Figure 2, liquid crystal
material M is contained between the plates P of a capacitor C.
(Each box labeled "DEVICE" in Figure 1 contains one of the
devices shown in Figure 2.) Each plate P in Figure 2 actually
takes the form of a thin coating of Indium Tin Oxide, ITO, on
GLASS, as indicated in Figure 3A. Each coating of ITO, in
turn, bears a coating of polyimide, as indicated in the insert
4. The polyimide has been rubbed, during manufacture, in a
unidirectional manner. The rubbing causes the molecules of
the liquid crystal material, which are adjacent to the
polyimide, to align with the direction of rubbing. For
example, molecules M1 and M2 align as shown. The polyimide
layers are arranged such that the aligned molecules M1 and M2
are perpendicular to each other, as shown. The molecules
located in the bulk of the liquid crystal try to align
themselves with M1 and M2, but, because M1 and M2 are
perpendicular, the bulk molecules align into a helix H which
bridges M1 and M2.Polarizing filters are affixed to each sheet of GLASS, as
indicated. When incoming LIGHT enters, as shown in Figure 3B,
the polarization of the LIGHT follows the twisted molecules,
and the LIGHT undergoes a continuous 90-degree twist, as 
shown, and exits through the bottom polarizing filter. The
human EYE, perceives the pixel as bright, because of the
exiting LIGHT. However, when a small voltage (such as 3 - 5
volts) is applied between the ITO plates, the voltage creates
an ELECTRIC FIELD in Figure 4, which disturbs the gradual
twist of the molecules. The helix no longer exists. The
light is no longer twisted as it travels, but is blocked by
the lower polarizing filter, as shown in Figure 5. The pixel
appears dark.In an actual LCD, the number of pixels is quite large.
For example, the display of a small computer can contain an
array of 480 x 640 pixels, giving a total of 307,200 pixels.
With such a large number of pixels, the voltage described in
connection with Figure 4 is applied to each MOS in multiplex
fashion. In multiplexing, there exists an external Random-Access
Memory (termed Video RAM, or V-RAM) which contains a
memory cell for each pixel. A video
