<ABSTRACT>
For the continuous monitoring of the concentration of methane in the air, gas sensors using semiconducting metal oxides and heat-of-reaction sensors are usually used. Because of the observed cross-sensitivity to other reducing gases, the selectivity of this type of sensor for methane is not particularly high. The aim of the invention is to widen the range of applications of prior art metal-oxide gas sensors. This aim is achieved by virtue of the fact that, at temperatures within the range 700 to 850  DEG C, oxygen-sensitive, semiconducting metal oxides such as Ga2O3 are extremely sensitive to methane, and no significant cross-sensitivity is observed to other reducing gases such as hydrogen or carbon monoxide. In addition, a high water-vapour concentration in the air has no effect on the conductivity of these metal oxides. Within the stated temperature range, Ga2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3, CeO3, SrTiO3, Nb2O3 or HfO2 sensors can thus be used as highly selective methane detectors. The invention is applicable to the detection of methane in the air.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a sensor, which is based on an oxygen-sensitive 
semiconducting metal oxide and has a temperature 

in the range from 700 to 850°C, for detecting 
methane. 
Method for operating a gas sensor which comprises 
two electrodes, conductively connected to one another via 

an oxygen-sensitive semiconducting metal oxide, and a 
heating element, characterized in that, for the purpose 

of the determination of methane, the metal oxide is 
heated to a constant temperature in the range of from 700 

to 850°C and its resistance, conductivity or relative 
permeability is measured. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the metal oxide is heated to a temperature of 775°C.
