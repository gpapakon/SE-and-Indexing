<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of aroma esters by esterifying a C2-6 aliphatic carboxylic acid or a mixture of such acids with a C2-6 aliphatic alcohol or with a mixture of such alcohols in an organic solvent at a temperature of 5-70  C in the presence of a hydrolase enzyme which is stable in the solvent applied, under maintaining the acid:alcohol molar ratio between 1:0.5 and 1:10. According to the invention the starting acid content of the reaction mixture is adjusted to 75-99 % of the acid concentration which causes substrate inhibition, the acid and the alcohol consumed in the reaction are supplemented continuously, at the rate of their consumption, and the water content of the reaction mixture is maintained at 0.01-2.0 % by weight throughout the whole reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation 
of aroma esters (i.e. C2-6 aliphatic esters of C2-6 
carboxylic acids) by esterifying the respective C2-6 aliphatic 
carboxylic acids with the respective C2-6 aliphatic 
alcohols in an organic solvent in the presence of an enzyme 
catalyst. The natural or nature-like aroma esters prepared 
according to the invention can be utilized, for example, 
in food industry.  
 In modern food industrial techniques foods and beverages 
should frequently be completed with aroma substances, 
since aroma, flavour and odour substances originally present 
may damage under the conditions of foodstuff production 
and/or preservation, or a part of them gets lost. Although 
a part of the lost aroma substances can be recovered and, 
after appropriate enrichment steps, returned into the products, 
due to the relatively low efficiency of the recovering 
and enrichment operations it is advisable to complete 
them with natural or nature-like aroma components in order 
to supplement the losses. Methods for preparing aroma concentrates can be 
classified into the following three main groups: distillation 
or rectification; adsorption followed by desorption; 
extraction. The process steps and their combinations applied 
to perform these methods are selected so that losses in 
aroma components can be suppressed to the minimum. However, 
even when operating with maximum care, the original combination 
of aroma substances can never be reproduced in the 
resulting concentrates; thus e.g. if a fruit juice is 
applied as starting substance, the ratio of the individual 
aroma components in the resulting concentrate will always 
differ in more or less extent, depending on the type and 
quality of the starting fresh fruit juice and on the combination 
of operations applied, from that observed in the 
fresh juice. These differences are not only due to the inevitable 
losses occurring in the various physical operations 
but undesired decomposition processes can be detected, 
too (Hochberg: Getränkeindustrie 9, 784 /1986/).  
 Aroma substances and aroma components produced by biotechnological 
methods from reactants of natural origin 
under applying naturally occurring reaction aids (such as 
solvents, catalysts etc.) or under ensuring that non-natural 
components do not appear in the product are regarded as 
natural substances in most of the countries. From biotechnological 
aspects the methods for producing such nature-like 
substances can be classified into the following two main 
group

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of aroma esters 
by esterifying a C
2-6
 aliphatic carboxylic acid or a mixture 
of such acids with a C
2-6
 aliphatic alcohol or with 
a mixture of such alcohols in an organic solvent at a 

temperature of 5-70°C in the presence of a hydrolase enzyme 
which is stable in the solvent applied, under maintaining 

the acid : alcohol molar ratio between 1:0.5 and 
1:10, characterized in that the initial acid content of 

the reaction mixture is adjusted to 75-99% of the acid 
concentration which causes substrate inhibition, the acid 

and the alcohol consumed in the reaction are supplemented 
continuously, at a rate of their consumption, and the 

water content of the reaction mixture is maintained at 
0.01-2.0 % by weight throughout the whole reaction either 

by passing the reaction mixture continuously and at a 
controlled rate through a solid or liquid desiccant, or 

by subjecting a portion of the reaction mixture to azeotropic 
distillation to remove water and supplementing 

the solvent removed. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the water content of the reaction mixture is 

maintained at 0.05-1.0 % by weight.
