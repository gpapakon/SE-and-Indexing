Disclosed herein is a printing process in which at 
least two inks are applied to a cloth according to an ink-jet 

system to conduct printing, which comprises at least 
three steps of: 


(a) applying the two inks to the cloth in such a 
manner that at least a part of the inks overlap each 

other; 
(b) subjecting the cloth, to which the inks have 
been applied, to a heat treatment; and 
(c) washing the heat-treated cloth, 
 
wherein the cloth is a cloth comprising fibers dyeable

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
printing a cloth by an ink-jet system, and
printed cloths obtainable thereby.At present, textile printing is principally
conducted by screen printing or roller printing. Both
methods are however unfit for multi-kind small-quantity
production and difficult to quickly cope with the fashion
of the day. Therefore, there has recently been a demand
for establishment of an electronic printing system making
no use of any plate.In compliance with this demand, many textile
printing processes according to an ink-jet system have
been proposed. Various fields expect much from such
textile printing processes.As conditions required for ink-jet textile printing,
may be mentioned the following:
(1) being able to achieve sufficient color depth
upon coloring of ink;(2) being able to provide a print high in color 
yield of coloring matter on cloth and to conduct a waste
water treatment after completion of washing with ease;(3) causing little irregular bleeding due to color
mixing between inks of different colors on cloth;(4) being able to achieve color reproduction within
a wide range; and(5) being able to always conduct stable production
of prints.In order to satisfy these requirements, it has
heretofore been conducted principally to add various
additives to ink, to control shot-in ink quantity, or to
subject cloth to a pretreatment.EP-A-0 212 655 discloses ink-jet printing on cloth with various disperse dyes. Overlapping printing with inks of different colours is not mentioned.EP-A-0 533 760 (published 04.08.93, filing date 26.01.93, priority date 27.01.92) discloses ink-jet printing on cloth
with different inks, forming mixed color regions. No specific disperse dye is mentioned.EP-A-605 730 (published 13.07.94, filing date 30.04.93,
earliest priority date 27.07.92) discloses ink-jet printing on cloth with different colors. The specific dyes according to the present invention are not mentioned.As an ink-jet printing method for cloth, for
example, a polyester fabric, on which disperse dyes are
used to conduct textile printing, a method making use of
disperse dyes having a sublimation temperature of 180Â°C or
higher is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
JP-A-61-118477. However, when textile printing is
conducted with inks making use, as coloring matter, of the
disperse dyes in which attention is paid to the
sublimation temperature only, good coloring is achieved
where the individual inks are used singly to dye, but the
color depth and color tone after the
