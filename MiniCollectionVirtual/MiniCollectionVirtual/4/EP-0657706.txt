<ABSTRACT>
An icemaker (10) for a refrigerator has a timer controlled solenoid 
operated 

water fill valve (26) for water fill of the receptacle (12) in which 
ice is to be formed. In 

the event of malfunction of the solenoid timer control during water 
fill, overheat 

of the solenoid (28) and flooding are prevented by a PTC resistor (54) 
in series with the 

solenoid (28) to limit the current to cause solenoid (28) de-actuation 
before the coil 

overheats and before receptacle overflow. The PTC resistance (54) 
may also be 

electrically in series with a heater (38) employed for facilitating 
ice extraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to valves of the type employed in icemakers 
used in household refrigerators where chunks of ice are formed in a freezer 
compartment and harvested in batches in a continuously repeated cycle of 
operation. Icemakers of this type typically employ an electrically operated 
water fill valve which dispenses a controlled amount of water to fill a 
partitioned receptacle in which the water is frozen to form the ice chunks or 
particles of a desired size and shape. Typically, a mechanical device is operated 
in timed sequence to extract the ice chunks from the tray; and, it is commonly 
known to employ a heater for localized heating of the receptacle to facilitate the 
mechanical extraction of the ice chunks from the receptacle. In the aforesaid type icemaker, the electrically operated water valve is 
typically of the solenoid actuated type; and, a timer control is provided in circuit 
with the solenoid to provide timed energization and de-energization of the water 
valve for filling the receptacle with the desired amount of water from a supply 
line connected to the refrigerator. In the event of a malfunction of the timer in 
a mode which would keep the fill valve solenoid energized beyond the normal 
fill time, the solenoid coil is subject to overheating and burnout leaving the 
icemaker permanently disabled. In addition, the fill valve can remain open for a 
sufficient period of time before burnout of the solenoid coil so as to result in 
overfill of the receptacle and flooding of the refrigerator. Thus it has been 
desired to provide a way or means of protecting an electrically operated valve 
and particularly a solenoid of the type employed in a refrigerator icemaker from 
damage resulting from malfunction of the timer for controlling the energization 
of the electrically operated water fill valve for the ice forming receptacle.  The present invention provides overheating protection for a time 
controlled solenoid operated valve and particularly provides such protection in 
the event of failure of the timing control employed for energizing and de-energizing 
the valve when the valve is in the energized condition for a prolonged 
period of time in which overheating and burnout of the solenoid coil can occur. 
In normal operation, the valve is operated only for a period of time necessary to 
permit a desired amount of flow and a time period which is insufficient to 
permit overheating of the solenoid coil. However, upon failure of the timing 
control while the valve is
