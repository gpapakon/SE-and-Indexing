<CLAIMS>
A process for the resolution of racemic verapamil, 
which comprises reacting the free base of the 

compound with optically active dibenzoyltartaric acid or 
ditoluoyltartaric acid 
in the molar ratio from 1:1 to 1:2 
in a methanol/water mixture in the ratio from 1:1 to 3:1 

or acetone/water mixture in the ratio from 0.5:1 to 2:1, 
separating the mixture of diastereomers obtained in this 

way by crystallization, and then converting the distereomers 
into the free bases and these into their salts, 

if required, with physiologically tolerated acids. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein up to 
50% of the optically active dibenzoyltartaric acid or 

ditoluoyltartaric acid is replaced by hydrochloric acid. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
verapamil is reacted with optically active dibenzoyltartaric 

acid or ditoluoyltartaric acid in the molar 
ratio 1:0.75 in the presence of 0.5 mol of hydrochloric 

acid.
