<ABSTRACT>
Non-steroidal compounds which are high affinity, high specificity ligands for progesterone receptors are disclosed. The compounds include synthetic derivatives of cyclocymopol and its diastereomers, spectroscopically and chromatographically pure (3R)-cyclocymopol monomethyl ether, which functions as a progesterone receptor antagonist, and spectroscopically and chromatographically pure (3S)-cyclocymopol monomethyl ether, which functions as a progesterone receptor agonist. Also disclosed are methods for employing the disclosed compounds for modulating processes mediated by progesterone receptors and for treating patients requiring progesterone receptor agonist or antagonist therapy.

 DESCRIPTIONNon-Steroid Progesterone Receptor Agonist And Antagonist Compounds And MethodsRelated ApplicationThis application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/872,710 filed April 21, 1992, whose entire disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.Field of the InventionThis invention relates to intracellular receptors and ligands therefor. More specifically, this invention relates' to compounds which are non-steroidal progesterone receptor antagonists or agonists, and methods for use of such compounds or ligands.Background of the InventionA central problem in eukaryotic molecular biology continues to be the elucidation of molecules and mechanisms that mediate specific gene regulation in response to molecular inducers such as hormones. As part of the scientific attack on this problem, a great deal of work has been done in efforts to identify molecular inducers which are capable of mediating specific gene regulation.Although much remains to be learned about the specifics of gene regulation, it is known that certain small molecule, non-peptide hormones and similarly acting vitamins and vitamin metabolites (collectively hereinafter called "hormones") modulate gene transcription by acting in concert with intracellular components, including intracellular receptors and discrete DNA promoter enhancer sequences known as hormone response elements (HREs) .These hormones, acting through, and as "ligands" for, their intracellular receptors, directly regulate hormone- 

responsive genes (and perhaps other important genes which are not directly hormone-responsive) . Natural ligands for intracellular receptors are synthesized in the body or may be taken in as a component of food. It has also been shown that compounds other than the natural ligands can act upon intracellular receptors to regulate hormone- responsive genes. For example, some natural product derivatives and synthetic compounds also function as ligands for these receptors. Intracellular receptors form a class of structurally- related genetic regulators scientists have named "ligand dependent transcription factors." Regulation of a gene by such factors requires both the intracellular receptor itself and a corresponding ligand which has the ability to selectively bind to the intracellular receptor in a way that affects gene activity. Until bound by a ligand, the intracellular receptor is unable to exert an effect on the gene. Hormone or other ligand molecules in the fluid surrounding a cell pass through the outer cell membrane by
