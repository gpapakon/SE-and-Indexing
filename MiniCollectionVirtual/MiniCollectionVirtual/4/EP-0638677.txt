Device for feeding weft threads to a weft thread insertion element (17) in
looms, the device comprising a spatially adjustable supporting and guiding

device having a carrier part (1), a guide part (2) and a connecting piece (3)
and electric motor-driven weft thread selection and feeding devices (8), each

of the devices (8) comprising at least one thread feeder (5) and each device
(8) furthermore being in independent connection with the carrier part (1) and

with the guide part (2) in the manner of an interchangeable unit, characterised
in that the guide part (2) comprises a base part (2a) having linear guide

halves (10a) and a top part (2b) that is arranged to be releasably connected
to the base part (2a), the top part having linear guides (10b) of laterally

reversed construction to that of the linear guide halves (10a) of the base part
(2a), and the top part (2b) being arranged displaceably on the base part (2a)

for the purpose of removing the thread feeders (5).
