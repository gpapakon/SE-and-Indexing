<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new class of tricyclic indole-2-carboxylic
acid derivatives which are selective antagonists of glycine binding
site of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor. Particularly, the compounds
provided by the present invention show in vivo antagonism against the
excitation of the NMDA receptors under systemic administration and therefore,
are especially useful for minimizing damage of the central nervous system induced
by ischemic or hypoxic conditions such as stroke, hypoglycemia, cardiac arrest,
and physical trauma, (see, J. McCulloch, Br. J. clin. Pharmacol., 34, 106
(1992)). The compounds are also useful in treatment of a number of
neurodegenerative disorders including epilepsy, Huntington's chorea,
Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (reviews: G. Johnson, Annu.
Rep. Med. Chem., 24, 41 (1989) and G. Johson and C. F. Bigge, ibid., 26, 11,
(1991)). The present compounds also have analgetic, antidepressant,
anxiolitic, and anti-schizophrenic activities, by virtue of this NMDA-glycine
antagonism, as indicated by recent reports, e.g. A. H. Dickenson and E. Aydar,
Neuroscience Lett., 121, 263 (1991), R. Trullas and P. Skolnick, Eur. J.
Pharmacol., 185, 1 (1990), J. H. Kehne, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 193, 283
(1991) P. H. Hutson, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 103, 2037 (1991), in which the
reagents affecting glycine-binding site of NMDA receptors have shown such
activities. Excessive release of glutamic acid and/or glycine from neuronal and
glial cells results in overexcitation of NMDA receptor-Ca2+ channel complexes
and successive massive amount of Ca2+ influx into the cell, which leads to
neuronal cell death. NMDA-glycine antagonists described in the present
invention would obviously regulate the amount of Ca2+ influx from the glycine
modulatory site of NMDA receptor-channel complex to maintain normal
activities of neuronal cell. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention
may be potential therapeutic agents for any diseases of animals including
human caused by excessive glutamic acid and/or glycine release in addition to
the diseases indicated above. Certain indole-2-carboxylic acid derivatives are known to act as an antagonist of
the glutamate receptors, especially the NMDA receptor subtype (J. Med. Chem.,33, 2944 (1990)). Unsubstituted tricyclic indole-2-carboxylic acid, 1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz[cd]indole-2-carboxylic
acid has already been described in J. Am.
Chem. Soc.77, 3334 (1957). However, tricyclic indole-2-carboxylic acid
derivatives having a substituent
