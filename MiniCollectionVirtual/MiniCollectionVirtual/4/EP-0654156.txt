<ABSTRACT>
A circuit (100) for powering fluorescent lamps (102, 104 and 106) includes a switch (50) having "open" and "closed" positions. When power is initially applied to the circuit, the lamps are powered at full power to enable them to "strike". After a short period, the power is reduced to the lamp. A control circuit (300) thereafter senses if the switch has been "toggled". If toggled, the power to the lamps is increased, and the lamps brighten. The circuit uses a conventional two-position switch and conventional wiring and avoids the need for additional switches and additional wiring.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TOGGLE BRIGHTENING CIRCUIT FOR POWERING GAS DISCHARGE LAMPS AND METHOD FOR OPERATING GAS DISCHARGE LAMPSField of the InventionThis invention relates to a circuit for powering gas discharge lamps and a method for operating gas discharge lamps.Background of the InventionA control circuit is typically used with one or more lamps to control the illumination of lamps from a switch having an "ON" and an "OFF" position. In such an application the control circuit senses when the switch is in the "ON" position and in response produces a signal to enable the lamp or lamps to produce illumination. The control circuit senses when the switch is in the "OFF" position and in response thereto produces a signal to disable the lamp or lamps from illuminating.Such a control circuit provides control of the lamps in one of two conditions: full illumination or no illumination, depending on whether the switch is instantaneously in the "ON" position or "OFF" position respectively.In some applications it is desired to control the lamps or lamps in a third condition: for example, at a level of illumination intermediate between full illumination and no illumination. In such an application it has heretofore been necessary to use either an alternative switch having three positions (for example, an "OFF" position, an "intermediate-ON" position and a "full-ON" position) instead of the two- position switch described above, or to use a further 

two-position switch in addition to the two-position switch described above in order to provide an additional switch position for the intermediate illumination condition of the lamp or lamps. In either case, whether a substitute switch or an additional switch is used to provide the additional switch position for intermediate illumination, additional wiring is typically required to connect the additional switch position to the control circuit. If it is desired to "retro-fit" lighting having abilities of both "full-ON" and "intermediate-ON" (often referred to as "dimmable" lighting) as well as "OFF" into an existing installation having just "ON" and "OFF" abilities as described above, this will thus require the installation of a different or an additional switch and also require the installation of additional wiring, which will significantly increase the cost of the retroÂ¬ fitting exercise if the switch or switches are wall- mounted and the additional wiring needs to be hidden within the wall and/or ceiling, as is typically the case.In U.S. patent 5,194,781, assigned to the assignee herein, such

Claims
We claim :
1. A circuit for powering a gas discharge lamp from a source of AC power, comprising: lamp energizing means for energizing the lamps at a high energy level and a low energy level; a capacitor arranged to become charged when power is provided to the circuit; a control circuit for controlling the lamp energizing means so that when power is applied to the circuit : if the level of charge of the capacitor is below a predetermined level, the lamp energizing means energizes the lamps at a high energy level for a short period of time, and then energizes the lamps at a the low energy level after the short period of time; but if the level of charge of the capacitor is above a predetermined level, the lamp energizing means energizes the lamps at the high energy level.
2. The circuit of claim 1 including a switch having a first and second state coupled to the lamp energizing means and to the source of AC power, such that when the switch is in its first state, no power is supplied to the lamp energizing means, and when the switch is in its second state, full power is applied to the lamp energizing means;
3. The circuit of claim 2 where the lamp energizing means comprises an inverter. 


4. The circuit of claim 3 wherein the low level of energy is about one-half the high level of energy.
5. A method of operating fluorescent lamps, comprising the steps of: energizing the fluorescent lamps at from a source of AC power so that the lamps strike; automatically decreasing the energy supplied to the fluorescent lamps after a predetermined length of time so that the lamps operate at a low energy level; increasing the energy supplied to the fluorescent lamps so that the lamps operate at a high energy level if power to the fluorescent lamps is interrupted for a brief period of time.
6. The method of claim 5 where the brief period of time is less than one-half second.
7. The method of claim 6 including the steps of: charging a capacitor when the lamps are energized; discharging the capacitor when the lamps are not energized; if the energy supplied to the lamps is interrupted, sensing if the capacitor is discharged; if the capacitor has not discharged during the interruption of energy, operating the lamps at a high energy level.
8. A circuit for powering fluorescent lamps from a source of AC power at a first frequency comprising: a rectifier controllably coupled to the source of AC power for converting the AC at a first frequency to DC power; 


 a boost circuit coupled to the rectifier for increasing the voltage of the DC power to a high level or a low level; an inverter coupled to the rectifier for converting the DC power to AC power at a second higher frequency; a connector circuit for connecting the AC power produced by the inverter to the fluorescent lamps; a control circuit for causing the boost circuit to:
(1) produce DC power at the high voltage level when power is first applied to the rectifier;
(2) produce DC power at a low voltage level after a short period of time after power is first applied to the rectifier; and
(3) produce DC power at a high voltage level if power to the rectifier is momentarily interrupted.
9. The circuit of claim 8 including a switch for controlling whether AC power at a first frequency is coupled to the rectifier.
10. The circuit of claim 9 including a capacitor coupled to the control circuit such that the capacitor charges when the switch is closed, and discharges when the switch opens .
