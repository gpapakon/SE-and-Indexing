<ABSTRACT>
An in vitro method is disclosed which is useful for 
detecting the presence of invasive stimuli in mammals. The 

method uses anti-cachectin antibodies to test for the 
presence of cachectin in a sample. Furthermore, a test kit 

is disclosed for effecting this method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an in vitro method for 
detecting the presence of invasive stimuli in mammals, 
wherein an anti-cachectin antibody is used to test for the 
presence of cachectin in a sample. Furthermore, the 
invention relates to test kits for effecting said method. The Applicants are authors or co-authors of several 
articles directed to the subject matter of the present 
invention. These articles are (1) Beutler et al.,

in part by grants from the National Institute of Health 
and the Rockefeller Foundation. The present invention is directed to in vitro methods for 
detecting the effects of invasive stimuli such as infection 
upon animal hosts. In particular, it discloses the 
identification of materials which may participate in the 
host response to such invasive stimuli. Several common physiological and biochemical derangements 
have been observed in various mammalian hosts responding 
to a variety of invasive stimuli such as bacterial, viral 
and protozoan infections, as well as tumors and 
endotoxemia. For example, these responses include fever, 
leukocytosis, hyperlipidemia, reduced food intake 
(cachexia) and activity, and other modifications in 
muscle, white blood cell and liver metabolism. In 
particular, recent studies aimed at elucidating the 
biochemical mechanism of cachexia in rabbits infected with 
Trypanosoma brucei noted that animals with a minimal 
parasite burden became moribund and exhibited an extreme 
hypertriglyceridemia, with a marked elevation of plasma 
very low density lipoprotein (VLDL); see C.A. Rouser and 
A. Cerami, MOL. BIOCHEM. PARASITOL. 1:31-38 (1980). The  
 
hypertriglyceridemic state was remarkable in view of the 
severe wasting diathesis that accompanied this 
experimental infection. The elevation of plasma VLDL was 
shown to result from a clearing defect, caused by a loss 
of peripheral tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. LPL activity has been observed by
