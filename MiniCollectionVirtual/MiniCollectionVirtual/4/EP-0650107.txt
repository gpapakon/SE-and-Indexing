<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a control system for motorised drives, especially for gates, conveyor systems, transport devices, lifts for the disabled and the like, in which predeterminable stop positions are implemented whilst carrying out comparison processes between current and stored signals. In this case, use is made of a position comparator, designed as a multifunction unit, with associated counter unit, which comparator is combined with a pulse generator provided for the determination of the current position in a compact unit having a minimised signal transmission path, while the connecting lead which is provided between the position comparator and the external control unit, which is separate therefrom, is used as a data line for the transmission of [lacuna] in the form of information telegrams and associated test telegrams.
