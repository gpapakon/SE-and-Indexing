<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cleaning installation (1) for separating off and/or filtering out water-soluble, dispersed or other constituents from a liquid, in particular for treating washing water containing dye (colorant) and/or glue, comprising a reaction vessel (3), a receiver (2) and also optionally comprising a filter vessel (4) or similar filter unit. It is characteristic of the cleaning installation (1) of the invention that the reaction vessel (3) is connected to the receiver (2) via a liquid line (12) which can, at least in its line section on the inflow side, be positioned in the interior space of the reaction vessel (3) and on the outflow side opens into the receiver (2). In the cleaning installation of the invention, the line section on the inflow side of the liquid line (12) can be positioned in the reaction vessel (3) in such a way that the inlet orifice of this liquid line (12) is directly above the interface between two liquid layers.

A cleaning installation (1) for separating and/or 
filtering out water-soluble, dispersed or other 

constituents from a fluid, in particular for treating 
washing water containing paint and/or glue, including a 

reaction vessel (3), a collecting vessel (2) as well as 
a filter vessel (4) or similar filter unit, the 

discharge opening(s) (25) of said filter unit being 
arranged above the collecting vessel (2), 
characterized 
in that
 in order to pour out the fluid contained in the 
reaction vessel (3) said reaction vessel is adapted to 

be tipped or swung about an approximately horizontal 
pivot (5) arranged spaced above the collecting vessel 

(2), that the filter vessel (4) or the like is provided 
on that side of the pivot (5) which is averted from the 

reaction vessel (3), and that the feed opening or inlet 
of the filter vessel (4) is arranged beneath at least 

one outlet (8) of the reaction vessel (3). 
A cleaning installation as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the reaction vessel (3) is 

connected to the collecting vessel (2) by way of a 
fluid duct (12) of which at least the inflow portion is 

adapted to be positioned inside the reaction vessel (3)  
 

and of which the outflow portion ends in the collecting 
vessel (2). 
A cleaning installation as claimed in claim 1 or claim 
2, characterized in that at least the inflow portion of 

the fluid duct (12) takes the form of a pipe having at 
least one segment (13, 14, 15) held so as to be capable 

of swivelling approximately vertically and preferably 
also horizontally for positioning the pipe inlet(s) 

(19). 
A cleaning installation as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the pipe is adapted to be 

swivelled into a position in which the inlet(s) is 
(are) arranged above the liquid level in the reaction 

vessel. 
A cleaning installation as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that the reaction vessel (3) 

and possibly also the filter vessel (4) or the like are 
arranged above the collecting vessel (2) and that the 

outlet(s) (17) of the fluid duct (12) in the reaction 
vess
el (3) are preferably arranged at approximately the 
level of the bottom (16) thereof. 
A cleaning installation as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the filter unit takes the 

form of a filter basket permeable to fluid at least at 
its bottom facing the collecting vessel (2) and adapted 

to receive preferably a filter bag or similar 
replaceable filter element. 
A cleaning installation as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that the cleaning installation 

(1) has a flush pipe for cleaning paintbrushes,  
 

rollers, utensils or other items in the region of the 
reaction vessel (3), said pipe having in the region of 

its preferably manipulable and/or flexible outflow end 
a shower head or similar cleaning head (21). 
A cleaning installation as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the inflow region (20) of 

the flush pipe is arranged in the collecting vessel (2) 
to draw off the fluid contained therein and that 

preferably a liquid pump (23) is interconnected in the 
flush pipe and in particular is operable by way of a 

foot actuated switch. 
A cleaning installation as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that the liquid pump (23) 

takes the form of a submersible pump or booster pump. 
A cleaning installation as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 9, characterized in that the reaction vessel (3) 

preferably has above its liquid level a perforated 
plate, grid tray or similar cleaning receptacle (9). 
A cleaning installation as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 10, characterized in that the reaction vessel (3), 

the collecting vessel (2) and/or the filter vessel (4) 
or the like are made essentially of plastic, preferably 

of polypropylene, or of metal, particularly of special 
steel. 
A cleaning installation as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 11, characterized in that associated with the 

collecting vessel (2) there is a make-up water supply 
line with an inserted check or control element operable 

in dependence on the liquid level of the collecting 
vessel (2).  

 
A cleaning installation as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 12, characterized in that a stirring mechanism, in 

particular an electric or pneumatic one, is associated 
with the reaction vessel and is preferably controllable 

by way of a timing unit.
