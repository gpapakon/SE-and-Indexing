<ABSTRACT>
A safety shielding device as used in welding and welding torches, having an electro-optical protective light filter (5) and a control device (6). The electronic system of the control device (6) is designed in such a way that the protective light filter (5) darkens as quickly as possible in the case of glare, but that upon extinguishing the source of glare the brightening time can be controlled as a function of the duration and intensity of the glare.

Glare protection device suitable for glasses, helmets
and masks as are used in the welding and cutting torch

technology, with a photosensor (2), with detector electronics
(3) for generating a darkening signal, with

evaluation electronics (4) for controlling an electro-optical
light protective filter (5), whereby for controlling

the brightening time of the light protective
filter (5) a control device (6) is provided, characterized

in that the control device (6) registers at
least the intensity of the light impacting on the sensor

(2) and which control device is connected to a
timer (7), in order to at least detect the duration of

the darkening signal generated by the detector electronics
(3), and which control device (6) comprises a

multiplicator circuit (9) and a memory (8) in order to
logically and/or chronologically combine the registered

intensity of the light impacting the sensor (2) and the
registered duration of the darkening signal generated

by the detection electronics (3).
Glare protection device according to claim 1, characterized
in that the control device (6) registers the

progression of the light intensity impacting on the
sensor (2) and generates a signal for controlling the

brightening time of the light protective filter (5).
Glare protection device according to claim 1, characterized
in that the control device (6) generates a

reset signal after each glare phase which deactivates
the multiplicator circuit (9), thus resetting the memory

(8).
Glare protection device according to claim 3, characterized
in that the reset signal is delayed with respect

to the end of the glare phase. 
Glare protection device according to claim 2, characterized
in that the control device (6) registers the

absolute value of the amount of light impacting on the
sensor (2) and generates a signal for controlling the

bright-up time of the light protection filter (5).
Glare protection device according to one of claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the control device (6) generates

a signal which controls the steepness of the dark /
bright transition during the bright-up time.
Glare protection device according to claim 6, characterized
in that this signal is dependent upon a manually

adjustable setting of the protection factor.
