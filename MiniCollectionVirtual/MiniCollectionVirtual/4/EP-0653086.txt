<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, generally, to a device for alerting an
individual that a particular case, file or collection of documents requires
attention or immediate action, and more specifically to a paper clip,
binder or other means for physically maintaining the organization of
papers or documents coupled with a device informing that individual that
such collection of papers or documents require attention or action.Executives, secretaries, entrepreneurs, office workers and
individuals have employed countless techniques, methods, systems and/or
aids, ranging from simple reminder notes to complex computerized
docketing systems, to assist them in tracking critical deadlines associated
with specific files or documents. However, as Murphy's law would have
it, all systems can and will fail usually doing so at the worst possible
time. Another common problem is the dissociation of the deadline
reminder and the file. Either the individual knows that a certain action is
needed but can not find the file, or the individual has the documents but
has mislaid information regarding the due date. Oftentimes, the
documents or files are simply filed away in a file cabinet or buried in a
virtual sea of paperwork on top of "someone's" desk.US-A-5 097 429 shows use of an electronic timing
apparatus.For the foregoing reasons, the applicant has developed and herein
presents the following invention. The present invention presents a device for the monitoring of at least one
critical deadline associated with at least one document or file having an
edge portion, the device comprising a document attachment member
having a base portion and means for physical attachment to at least one
file or document, with said attachment member selectively retained in
association with said at least one file or document; and
an electrical circuit means including a housing supported on said
base portion of said document attachment member, to allow said electrical
circuit means to be selectively attached to said at least one document or
file, said electrical circuit means comprising a timing circuit means for
monitoring elapsed time and for producing one or more timing signals at
predetermined times relative to said at least one critical deadline, a
signalling means for producing a signal capable of human detection, and a
control means for receiving said timing signal and energizing said
signalling means.The device may be programmed to provide a visual and/or audible
signal at a prescribed time in advance of the critical date(s) or time(s).The device
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device (10) for the monitoring of at least one critical deadline associated
with at least one document (14) or file (12) having an edge portion, the

device (10) comprising:

a document attachment member (16) having a base portion and
means (28) for physical attachment to at least one file (12) or

document (14), with said attachment member selectively retained in
association with said at least one file or document; and
an electrical circuit means including a housing (32) supported on
said base portion of said document attachment member, to allow said

electrical circuit means to be selectively attached to said at least one
document or file, said electrical circuit means comprising a timing circuit

means (50) for monitoring elapsed time and for producing one or more
timing signals at predetermined times relative to said at least one critical

deadline, a signalling means (60) for producing a signal capable of human
detection, and a control means (52) for receiving said timing signal and

energizing said signalling means.
The device (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said device further
comprises a manual operable means (36) for actuating and deactivating

said electrical circuit means.
The device (10) as recited in claim 1, wherein said signalling
means is a display means (34) for producing a visual signal.
The device (10) as recited in claim 3 wherein said display means
(34) comprises a liquid crystal display. 
The device (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said signalling
means (60) generates an audible signal to indicate that said predetermined time

relative to said critical deadline has been reached.
The device (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said signalling means
comprises alarm means (37), the alarm means being coupled to said

control means (52) to receive at least one timing signal and produce an
alarm signal indicating that said predetermined time relative to said critical

deadline has been reached.
The device (10) as recited in claim 6 wherein said alarm means
includes a visual display means (34) for producing a visual indication that

said critical deadline has been reached.
The device (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said signalling
means (60) generates both audible and visual signals.
The device as recited in claim 1 wherein said means (28) of physical
attachment has a clip portion, said clip portion having a first and

second end, said first end attached to said base member and at least said
second end biased into contact with said at least one file or document.
The device (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said document
attachment member is a paper clip (48).
The device (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said document
attachment member is a binder clip (40).
The device (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said document
attachment member is a spring biased clasp (28'). 
The device (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said electrical circuit
means is detachably supported on said document attachment member.
The device (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said document
attachment member (16) and said electrical circuit means are combined

into a unibody construction (16').
The device as recited in claim 1 wherein said timing circuit
means (50) includes a housing (32) which is supported in association with

said base portion of said attachment member (16), and said housing of
said timing circuit means is supported at an outer edge portion of said

base portion and exterior to said edge portion of said at least one file or
document.
The device (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said control means
includes processing means (52) for repeated programming,

processing and storing of critical deadline information.
The device (10) as recited in claim 3, wherein said display
means (34) is supported on said base portion in a manner such that said

display means is visible exterior to said at least one file (12) or
document (14) to which said device (10) is attached.
