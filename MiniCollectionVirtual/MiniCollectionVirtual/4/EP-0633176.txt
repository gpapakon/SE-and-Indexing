<ABSTRACT>
A display-pallet lifting-truck for handling loading and/or transportation aids, in particular partial pallets of various sizes, has a vehicle frame (1) which is supported in the front region on castors and in the rear region on castor wheels and which cannot be changed in height. Attached to the vehicle frame (1) is a load-supporting part (14) which can be changed in height relative to the latter and has at least two load-bearing elements (16) which are parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. The display-pallet lift-truck is moreover provided with a lifting device (19) for changing the height of the load-supporting part (14) and with a steering handle (22). For handling partial pallets of various sizes in tight spaces, according to the invention the vehicle frame (1) of the display-pallet lift-truck has a U-shaped longitudinal portal (7) on its end side, the portal width (8) of which is at least slightly larger than the length of a quarter pallet or the width of a half pallet and/or the spacing widthwise between the outer edges of castors of a rolling container. The height (23) of the vehicle frame (1) is, at least over the region of the longitudinal portal (7), slightly smaller than the distance between the carriageway surface and the lower edge of the rolling container.

Transporting system having a display-pallet
lifting truck, a rolling container and a 1/4-pallet or

1/2-pallet located on the rolling container, it being the
case that the display-pallet lifting truck has a vehicle

frame (1), which is supported by castors in the front
region and by running rollers in the rear region and

cannot be changed in height, and a load-bearing part
(14), which can be changed in height relative to the

vehicle frame (1) and has at least two load-bearing
elements aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the

vehicle, as well as a lifting device (19), for changing
the height of the load-bearing part (14), and a steering-handle

(22) for removing the pallet lifting truck, and it
being the case that the vehicle frame (1) has an end-side,

U-shaped longitudinal portal (7) whose width (8) is
at least slightly greater than the length of the 1/4-pallet

and/or than the width of the 1/2-pallet, characterized
in that the portal width is at least slightly

greater than the distance widthwise between the outer
edges of castors (12) of the rolling container, and in

that the height (23) of the vehicle frame (1) at least
over the region of the longitudinal portal (7) is

slightly smaller than the distance between the surface of
the carriageway and the bottom edge of the rolling

container.
Transporting system according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the load-bearing elements (16) can be

lowered at least to the level of the vehicle frame (1).
Transporting system according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the load-bearing elements (16) on 

the load-bearing part (14) can be displaced laterally,
and arrested, independently of one another in the direction

transverse to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.
Transporting system according to one of Claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the load-bearing elements

(16) are designed rigidly at right angles and, at their
top end, are mounted such that they can be displaced

horizontally in a fork carrier shaft (17) fixed on the
load-bearing part (14), arresting pins being fastened in

the bottom region of the vertical angle leg of the load-bearing
elements (16) and being in operative connection

with corresponding latching bores (18) in the load-bearing
part (14).
Transporting system according to one of Claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the vehicle frame (1) comprises

two carrying arms (2, 3) which are spaced apart
from one another parallel to the longitudinal axis of the

vehicle and, at one end, are supported by in each case at
least one running roller (4) and, at the other end, are

connected transversely and supported by at least one
castor (12), and in that a roller guide (13), in which

the load-bearing part (14) is arranged such that it can
be changed in height, is fixed centrally on the transverse

carrier (6).
Transporting system according to one of Claims 1
to 5, characterized in that two front castors (12), on

both sides, are arranged within a wheel housing (9) which
is closed on all sides by the vehicle frame (1), the axes

of rotation of the castors (12) being arranged at a
distance in front of the axis of a lifting cylinder of

the lifting device (19).
Transporting system according to one of Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that a steering handle (22) is

connected directly or indirectly to the transverse
carrier (6), and its top end, on the one hand, is angled

away from the centre vertical on both sides to the
outsides of the vehicle and, on the other hand, is angled

downwards towards the user.
