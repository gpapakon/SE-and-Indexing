<DESCRIPTION>
 COMBINATION DISPLAY BACKLIGHT AND LIGHT SENSORField of the InventionThis invention relates in general to information displays, and more particularly to displays having a backlight for improving the visibility of information presented on the display.Background of the InventionVisual displays for presenting information exist in several known devices such as calculators, watches, and selective call receivers. Conventionally, the display comprises a liquid crystal display (LCD) that may be selectively programmed to display the information. Typically, the display includes either a reflective element contiguous to the display for reflecting light or a backlight mechanism for providing light through the display to improve the readability of the information. Still some previously known electronic devices having displays have included a light sensor separate from the display for enabling the backlight mechanism in low ambient light conditions.However, the light sensor requires additional space on the electronic device housing the display and may cause environmental problems by allowing dust, humidity, etc. access to the circuitry.Summary of the InventionA display device comprises a display for displaying information and an electroluminescent panel located contiguous to the display for sensing ambient light and lighting the display when the ambient light is below a threshold.Brief Description of the DrawingsFIG. 1 is a block diagram of a previously known selective call receiver.FIG. 2 is a cross section of a visual display and electroluminescent panel in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. 

 FIG. 3 is a partial schematic diagram in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.Description of a Preferred EmbodimentReferring to FIG. 1, a selective call radio receiver 10, e.g., a pager, comprises an antenna 11 that provides an RF carrier signal that is demodulated by the receiver 12 to provide a signal suitable for processing by the decoder 13 in a manner well known to one skilled in the art. The decoder 13 processes the recovered signal to decode the address and optional message data contained therein, and if the selective call receiver includes an optional voice output, the recovered audio components of the original signal received by the antenna 11. For selective call receivers with message storage, the recovered message or voice output is stored in the memory 14 for subsequent "playback" by an output 15. In operation, the microcomputer 16 compares information contained in the
