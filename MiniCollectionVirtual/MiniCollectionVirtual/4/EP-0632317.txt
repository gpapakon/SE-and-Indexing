<ABSTRACT>
An image printer (1) includes a projection exposure 
unit (5) for projecting and exposing a film (2) image on to a 

photosensitive material, an image exposure unit I for 
exposing the photosensitive material (3) based on exposure 

image information with setting an exposure amount for 
each of a plurality of areas, an image reader (15) for 

reading information of the film image with the 
information being divided into a number of areas, and 

a correction-information instructing unit for 
instructing correction information for correcting the 

image information read by the image reader. The image 
exposure unit I generates the exposure image information 

based on the image information read by the image 
reader means and on the correction information 

instructed by the correction-information instructing 
unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image printer.As an image printer for exposing a photosensitive
material with an image recorded on a film, there is
generally used an image printer for projecting and
exposing the film image on to the photosensitive
material.With such image printer, if the image quality of
the image recorded on the film is not favorable,
correction for improving the image quality is possible
in the projection-exposure of the photosensitive
material.This correction for image quality improvement
includes correction of contrast and correction of
color tone. As specific methods of such correction,
in the case of correction of contrast, the correction
has been effected by inserting, into an optical path 
extending from the film to the photosensitive
material, a mask having a shape corresponding to a
portion of the film image to be corrected, thereby to
adjust the amount of light passage.For the correction of color tone, there has been
used, as the mask, a filter capable of inhibiting a
light component of a particular color.According to the conventional image printer, a
film image is projected and exposed on to the
photosensitive material, with effecting the above-described
correction when necessary. On the other
hand, in the case of a film image not requiring such
correction, this film image is projected and exposed
as it is.Therefore, according to the conventional art, in
the case of the film image which does not require any
correction, the film image as it is may be projected
and exposed on to the photosensitive material, such
that a high-speed exposure operation is possible.
However, in case a correction of the film image is
needed, it is necessary to prepare a mask for each
film image which requires a correction. As a result,
the exposure operation requires a significant amount
of time and labor, thereby to considerably reduce the
exposure operation efficiency. The present invention attends to the above-described
state of the art. A primary object of the
present invention is to provide an image printer with
improved exposure operation efficiency by facilitating
the correction of the film image when needed while
retaining the advantage of the possibility of a high-speed
exposure operation by projection and exposure of
a film image which does not require any correction.For fulfilling the above-noted object, an image
printer, and a method of controlling an image printer
according to the present invention, are provided
as defined respectively in claim 1 and claim 3. EP-A-0 615 378, which was

<CLAIMS>
An image printer comprising:

a projection exposure unit (5) for projecting and exposing a film image onto
a photosensitive material (3);
reader means (15) for reading image information of the film image;
a memory (40) for storing the image information read by the reader means
(15);
a control unit (100) for controlling a light modulating filter (11) of the projection
exposure unit (5) based on the image information stored in memory

(40); and
an image exposure unit (I) for exposing the photosensitive material (3)
based on exposure image information;
characterised by
a monitor device (M) for displaying the image information and for allowing an operator to judge
whether or not the image of the film (2) needs contrast correction;
contrast correction keys (51a-52c) for inputting contrast correction information as the result of the judgement and
for determining the degree of contrast enhancement;
an exposure mode instructing means (E) for instructing
the control unit (100) to do a switch over between

a projecting exposure mode and an image exposure
mode so that said image exposure unit generates the image

exposure information based on the image information read by
the reader means and on the contrast correction information

instructed by the contrast correction keys ; and
a transporting system (M 2) for effecting, in cooperation with the image exposure
unit (I), exposure of one-line amount of the exposure image information after another

onto the photosensitive material (3) with switching over the exposing colours.
An image printer as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 the control unit (100) includes a projection exposure
mode wherein the projection exposure unit (5) generates the film image

on the photosensitive material (3) when no contrast correction
is required, and an image exposure mode

wherein the image exposure unit (I) generates the film image on the photosensitive
material (3), and in that the exposure mode

instruction means (E) effects a mode selection between the projection
mode and the image exposure mode. 
Method of controlling an image printer having a projection exposure unit
(5), a reader means (15), a control unit (100) including a memory (40), an

image exposure unit (I), comprising the steps of:

reading image information of the film image by the reader means (15);
storing the image information in the memory (40);
displaying of the image information;
correcting the display image information according to the correction-information
and displaying of corrected image information;
selecting of a corrected image information;
calculating exposure time period of the projection exposure unit (5) and the
image exposure unit (I);
exposing the photosensitive material (3) at the projection exposure unit (5)
or the image exposure unit (I) to generate the film image on the photosensitive

material (3);

characterised by the steps of :

displaying the read image information on a monitor device (M) for allowing an operator to judge
whether or not the image of the film (2) needs contrast correction;
inputting contrast correction information as the result of the judgement by contrast correction keys (51a-52c) so as to
determine the degree of the contrast enhancement;
instructing the control unit to do a switch over between a projection exposure mode and an image
exposure mode by an exposure mode instructing

means (E) so that said image exposure unit generates the image exposure information
based on the image information read by the reader means and on the

contrast correction information instructed by the contrast correction keys ; and
effecting, with a transporting system (M2) and the exposure unit (I) in cooperation,
exposure of one-line amount of the exposure image information after another
