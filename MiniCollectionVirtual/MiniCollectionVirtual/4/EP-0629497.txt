<ABSTRACT>
A multi-wall film (10) comprises two layers (11,12) of barrier 
film material which are peripherally sealed (13) one to 

another to form an enclosure (14), the enclosure (14) 
including a material (15) which is colour sensitive to 

presence or absence of a gas. A flexible container formed of 
such a film (10) is tamper evident because, if the film (10) 

is severed, the gas to which the material (15) is sensitive 
escapes from or enters in the enclosure (14) and the material 

(15) thereby changes colour and the colour change is visible. 
The enclosure (14) may be provided with spacing means, such as 

a mesh (16), the presence of which increases diffusion rate of 
gas into and out of the enclosure (14) when the film (10) is 

severed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multi-wall film particularly, but 
not exclusively, for use in manufacture of flexible 
containers. One of the major requirements for security envelopes and other 
packages which are formed of plastics film is for the film to 
change colour when it has been severed so that a flexible 
container formed of such a film is tamper evident. According to the present invention, there is provided a multi-wall 
film comprising two layers of barrier film material 
characterised in that the layers are sealed one to another to 
form an enclosure and there is provided within the enclosure 
a material which is colour sensitive to presence or absence of 
a gas so that, when the film is severed, the gas to which the 
material is sensitive escapes from or enters in the enclosure 
and the material thereby changes colour and the colour change 
is visible. Preferably, the material is sensitive to one of the gases in 
air, particularly oxygen or carbon dioxide. If the material 
is sensitive to oxygen, the multi-wall film is prepared in an 
atmosphere containing less oxygen than that present in air, 
for example pure nitrogen. If the material is sensitive to 
carbon dioxide, the multi-wall film is prepared in an 
atmosphere containing more carbon dioxide than that present 
in air, for example pure carbon dioxide.  When the multi-wall film is severed, the gas sensitive 
material will be exposed to air along the severed edges. The 
material will change in colour and the colour change will 
extend away from the edges as air diffuses in between the two 
outer layers and as gas contained within the enclosure 
diffuses outwardly therefrom; even a pinpoint puncture will be 
evident. An example of a suitable gas sensitive material is the 
indicator material disclosed in WO 91/05252 which can be 
formulated to change colour when exposed to a small amount of 
carbon dioxide, e.g. 0.03%, in air. The multi-wall film 
including the material would be prepared in the absence of 
carbon dioxide. Alternatively, the material can be formulated 
to change colour at a level of carbon dioxide higher than 
0.03% and the multi-wall film including the material would be 
prepared a carbon dioxide atmosphere. In this case, when the 
film is severed, carbon dioxide contained inside the film 
would be released and the material would change colour. It will be appreciated that other air sensitive materials 
would be suitable for the gas sensitive material. The colour change observed when the multi-wall film is severed 
occurs at

<CLAIMS>
A multi-wall film (10, 20) comprising two layers (11,12; 
21,22) of barrier film material characterised in that the 

layers (11,12; 21,22) are sealed one to another to form 
an enclosure (14) and there is provided within the 

enclosure (14) a material (15,23) which is colour 
sensitive to presence or absence a gas so that, when the 

film (1,20) is severed, the gas to which the material 
(15,23) is sensitive escapes from or enters in the 

enclosure (14) and the material (15,23) thereby changes 
colour and the colour change is visible.
