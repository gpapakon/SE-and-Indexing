<ABSTRACT>
An optical spectrum analyzer (FIG. 2) is provided with 

a user selectable sensitivity (160). Required operating 
parameters (172, 174, 176) are set in response to user 

selection of sensitivity (162) to permit measurement of 
an input light beam (12) at the selected sensitivity 

(160). Setting the required parameters (172, 174, 176) 
includes setting a required gain (172) of a video channel 

(48, 90, 92, 94, 96) to permit measurement of a specified 
maximum input signal and to provide the selected 

sensitivity (160), setting a required video bandwidth 
(174) of the video channel (48, 90, 92, 94, 96) to 

provide the selected sensitivity (160) at the required 
gain (172) of the video channel (48, 90, 92, 94, 96) and 

setting a sweep rate (176) to provide the selected 
sensitivity (160) at the required video bandwidth (174). 

When the normal bandwidth of the video channel (48, 90, 
92, 94, 96) is not adequate to provide the selected 

sensitivity (160), the electrical signal is passed 
through a digital filter (100) having a filter 

coefficient (FILTER COEFFICIENT) set to provide the 
required video bandwidth (174). A peak detector (90) is 

incorporated in the video channel (48, 90, 92, 94, 96) to 
accurately measure signal amplitudes in a fast scanning 

condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to instruments for
analyzing the spectrum of a light beam and, more
particularly, to optical spectrum analyzers.Optical spectrum analyzers are used for
analyzing the output light beams from lasers,
light-emitting diodes and other light sources.
Optical spectrum analyzers are particularly useful
for analyzing light sources for optical
telecommunication, where it is preferable to ensure
that the optical carrier includes only a single,
spectrally pure wavelength. In optical spectrum
analyzers, the light intensity of a light beam is
displayed as a function of wavelength over a
predetermined wavelength range. Parameters of
importance in optical spectrum analyzers include 
wavelength range, wavelength and amplitude accuracy,
sensitivity, resolution, measurement speed,
polarization insensitivity and dynamic range.Optical spectrum analyzers frequently use a
diffraction grating for separating the light beam to
be analyzed into its component wavelengths. The
input light beam to be analyzed is collimated and is
directed at the diffraction grating. The light beam
is spatially dispersed by the grating, since
different wavelengths are diffracted at different
angles. The grating is rotated so that the
dispersed light beam is scanned over a slit. The
light that passes through the slit is detected to
provide an output signal that represents amplitude
as a function of wavelength. The width of the slit
establishes the resolution of the monochromator.
Prior art optical spectrum analyzers have used
single stage monochromators as described above and
two stage monochromators, wherein two monochromators
operating in series provide improved performance.
The output electrical signal is displayed as a
function of diffraction grating position to provide
an optical spectrum of the input light beam.Optical spectrum analyzers should operate over a
wide range of parameter values for maximum
versatility. For example, the selected wavelength
span may range from a few nanometers to a few
hundred nanometers. In some cases, the user may
wish to accurately measure low amplitude signals,
thereby requiring long sweep times. In other cases, 
accurate measurement of small amplitude signals may
not be important to the user, and the sweep rate can
be increased. Prior art optical spectrum analyzers
have not adequately addressed the wide variety of
user requirements.Optical spectrum analyzers with optical fiber
inputs sometimes receive low power signal levels,
which require long sweep times. Long sweep times
are required
