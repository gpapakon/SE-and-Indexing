Punch, having a bottom part (10) placeable on a support,
at least two punching units (20) disposed adjustably in

terms of their distance apart on the bottom part (10) and
each comprising a punching bottom die (46), an insertion

slot (44) and a punching die (56), a pressure element
(18) preferably in the form of a pressure lever pivotally

supported or displaceably guided on the bottom part (10)
for displacing the punching dies (56), and a scale (24')

extending in the region in front of the insertion slots
(44) of the punching units (20) over the insertion length

of the bottom part (10) for adjusting the hole spacing
between the punching units (20), 
characterized in that
 an
upwardly open recess (22) extending over the insertion

length of the bottom part (10) is disposed in the bottom
part (10) in the region in front of the insertion slots

(44) and that disposed in the recess is a scale carrier
(24), which is rotatable 
about its longitudinal axis and
carries a plurality of scales (24') which, in various

rotary positions, are directed upwards and become visible
in the recess (22).
Punch according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
scale carrier (24) with its respective upwardly directed

scale (24') projects beyond the recess.
Punch according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

the scale carrier (24) is arrestable or latchable in
predetermined rotary positions on the bottom part (10).
Punch according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
that
 the scale carrier (24) is in the shape of a round
rod.
Punch according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
that
 the scale carrier (24) is in the shape of a
polygonal rod or a flat bar. 
Punch according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by

bearing journals (68, 70) which project in an axially
central manner from the ends of the scale carrier (24)

and engage into journal bearings (72, 76) non-rotatably
connected to the bottom part (10).
Punch according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 at
least one of the journal bearings takes the form of a

bearing sleeve (72) which is detachably fastenable,
preferably latchable, on the bottom part (10).
Punch according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that

disposed between at least one of the journal bearings
(72) and the scale carrier (24) are spring-assisted

detent means for arresting the scale carrier (24) in the
predetermined rotary positions.
Punch according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterized in that

formed on the, preferably plastic, bearing sleeve (72) is
a flexible spring tongue (80) having a detent cam (84),

which latches radially into detent recesses (82)
distributed over the periphery of the scale carrier (24).
Punch according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the
detent recesses (82) are elongated in an axial direction

of the scale carrier (24).
Punch according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the
detent means are formed by a spring-assisted detent ball,

which is disposed in an eccentric, paraxial recess of the
journal bearing, preferably the bearing sleeve (72), and

by a number of detent recesses arranged so as to be
peripherally distributed over the end face of the scale

carrier (24) facing the respective journal bearing at the
radial pitch of the detent ball.
Punch according to one of claims 7 to 11, 
characterized
in that
 one of the bearing journals (70) engages through
the associated journal bearing, preferably through the 

bearing sleeve (72), and carries on its part which
projects beyond the journal bearing a turning knob (74)

which is non-rotatably connected, preferably glued, to
the scale carrier (24).
Punch according to one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized
in that
 the scale carrier (24) is formed by two
longitudinally slit rod halves (25) which complement one

another in a mirror-image manner and may be latched
and/or glued to one another.
Punch according to claim 13, 
characterized in that
 the
rod halves (25) take the form of preferably identically

fashioned injection-moulded parts made of plastic
material.
Punch according to one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized
by
 a stop rail (30), which is disposed on the bottom part
(10) so as to be longitudinally displaceable parallel to

the scale carrier (24), is latchable in various sliding
positions and comprises a stop, which projects beyond the

bottom part (10), for a side edge of the paper to be
punched.
