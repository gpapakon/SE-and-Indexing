<ABSTRACT>
An improved coal pulverizer associated with a 
rotary classifier which can be operated always safely 

regardless of change of a species of coal, is disclosed. 
In a coal pulverizer associated with a rotary classifier 

which is applicable to the use of a pulverized coal burning 
boiler or the like, there are provided a function generator 

1 having a signal C.F. representing a coal feed rate input 
thereto for outputting signals representing a preset proper 

range of a motor current of the coal pulverizer corresponding 
to the coal feed rate, a computing unit 2 

responsive to a signal A representing the same motor current 
and signals representing a proper range of the motor current 

for outputting a command signal to maintain a number of 
revolution of the rotary classifier when the motor current 

represented by the motor current signal A is within the 
proper range while outputting a command signal to decrease 

or increase a number of revolution of the rotary classifier, 
respectively, in the case where the same motor current has 

increased beyond the proper range or in the case where the 
same motor current has decreased beyond the proper range, 

and a rotational speed controller 3 having the command 
signal input thereto for regulating a number of revolution 

of the rotary classifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coal pulverizer
provided with a rotary classifier applicable to a fuel
feed system of a pulverized coal burning boiler or the like
and to a method for operating the same.In a heretofore known coal pulverizer associated
with a rotary classifier applicable to a pulverized coal
burning boiler, a method for controlling a rotational speed
of a rotary classifier was such that either it
was preset always at a constant number of rotation as a
function of a coal feed rate as indicated by a curve a in
Fig. 5 or it was preset to take a number of revolution
represented by a number of segments as a function of a coal
feed rate as indicated by a curve b.Under a same coal feed rate, if a rotational speed
of the rotary classifier is increased, a grain
size of pulverized coal at the outlet of the coal pulverizer
becomes fine, hence a load factor of the coal pulverizer
increases and a motor current also increases. On the
contrary, if a rotational speed of the rotary classifier
is decreased, a gain size of the pulverized coal at the 
outlet of the outlet of the coal pulverizer becomes coarse,
and hence a load factor of the coal pulverizer as well as
the motor current decrease.In the event that property (brand) of the coal fed
to the above-described coal pulverizer has changed, for
instance, in the case where it has changed from coal having
high grindability (soft coal) to coal having low
grindability (hard coal), a motor current of the coal
pulverizer for the same coal feed rate increases. In the
case of very hard coal, sometimes the motor current exceeded
a rated current and resulted in motor trip. On the other
hand, in the case where coal is very soft, in view of
operation at a high efficiency of the boiler, it is
desirable to operate at an as high as possible degree of
pulverization, and to that end it is necessary to increase
a motor current of the coal pulverizer by increasing
a rotational speed of the rotary classifier.As a counter-measure against the above-mentioned
problem, a method shown in Fig. 6 has been
proposed, in which setting of a rotational speed of
a rotary classifier is manually changed depending upon
a brand of used coal.However, since coal is once fed to a large hopper
called "coal bunker", it is difficult to precisely know when
the brand of coal has changed. In addition, even with 
respect to a same brand of coal, it is not scarce that
property (especially grindability) changes widely, and so,
it was very difficult to properly set a rotational speed of
the rotary

A method for operating a coal pulverizer associated
with a rotary classifier which is applicable to the use of a

pulverized coal burning boiler or the like, wherein a
rotational speed of said rotary classifier is controlled so

that the motor current of said coal pulverizer falls within a
preset range for any arbitrary coal feed rate to prevent the

motor from tripping.
A coal pulverizer provided with a rotary classifier
which is applicable to the use of a pulverized coal burning

boiler or the like, comprising a function generator (1)
responsive to a coal feed rate signal (C.F.) input thereto

for outputting signals representing a proper range of a motor
current of said coal pulverizer corresponding to a given feed

rate;

a computing unit (2) responsive to a motor current
signal (A) of said coal pulverizer and the range signals (A

) of the motor current of the coal pulverizer output from
said function generator (1), for outputting a command signal

(ΔN) to maintain a rotational speed (N) of said rotary
classifier when the motor current of said coal pulverizer

represented by said motor current signal (A) is within the
before mentioned proper range, while outputting a command

signal (ΔN) to decrease or increase the rotational speed (N)
of said rotary classifier in the case where said motor

current has increased or decreased, respectively beyond said
proper range; and
a rotational speed controller (3) responsive to the
command signal of said computing unit (2) for regulating the

rotational speed (N) of said rotary classifier.
