<ABSTRACT>
Following an intravascular operation, the puncture channel is sealed as near to the vessel as possible with a two-part fibrin sealant. This is done by means of a device which comprises a sealing cannula (2) longitudinally transfixed by the working cannula (1). Either the working cannula (1) or the sealing cannula (2) is fitted with a medical connector (3). The sealing cannula (2) has a reinforced sleeve (4) with a connecting stub (5) in which the two fibrin sealant components are mixed (13) and introduced into the axial gap between the working and sealing cannulas. The fibrin sealant (F) is taken to the region of the vessel to be sealed via radial outlets (6).

Device for introducing two-component fibrin sealant into a puncture channel 
in the vicinity of an arterial or venous puncture point, the latter 

comprising a sealing cannula (2), which is axially traversed from top to 
bottom by a working cannula, which is used for the intravascular introduction 

of instruments into a vessel, characterized in that the working cannula (1) is 
surrounded in spaced manner by the sealing cannula (2), so that when using the 

device the fibrin sealant is guided from a connecting stub (5) to several 
slot-like, radially directed outlets (6) in the sealing cannula between the 

latter and the working cannula. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that at the upper end the 
sealing cannula (2) is provided with a one-piece shaped, reinforced sleeve 

(4). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the connecting stub (5) 
is laterally shaped in one piece onto the reinforced sleeve (4). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the connecting stub 
(5) is separately manufactured and is connectable (17) to the reinforced 

sleeve. 
Device according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that a mixing member 
(13) is insertably held in the connecting stub (5). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the internal diameter 
of the sealing cannula (2) decreases from the vicinity of the mouth of the 

connecting stub to the outlets (6). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the sealing cannula 
(2) has inwardly directed support ribs (9), which ensure a cavity (7) for 

guiding the fibrin sealant (F) from the connecting stub (5) to the outlets (6). 
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the support ribs (9) 
are oriented at least approximately radially. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the working cannula (7)  
 

is fixed to a medical connector (3), which running in positively and/or 
non-positively sealing manner and axially with respect to the working cannula 

(1) is held (15) in the reinforced sleeve (4) of the sealing cannula (2). 
Device according to claim 9, characterized in that the sealing cannula (2) 
has in the vicinity of the lower passage (10) of the working cannula (1) 

through the sealing cannula (2) a radially inwardly directed, circular sealing 
bead (11). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the sealing cannula (2) 
is closed at the top by a passage plug (18), in which is sealingly held a 

tubular support cover (20), which itself traverses the entire sealing cannula 
(2) and is sealingly held in the sealing cannula (2) at the opposite, lower 

end, and that the working cannula (1) is guided in freely movable manner in 
the support cover (20), so that the fibrin sealant (F) can flow in the radial 

free space (21) between the support cover (20) and the sealing cannula (2) 
from the connecting stub (5) to the outlets (6). 
Device according to claim 11, characterized in that the support cover (20) 
is provided with several, radially outwardly directed reinforcing ribs (16) 

directed towards the inner wall of the sealing cannula (2). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that at the lower end at 
which the working cannula (1) passes out of the sealing cannula (12), the latter 

has a suddenly widened, rounded head region (12). 
Device according to claim 12, characterized in that the head region (12) 
has an axially directed, circular sealing lip (22) bearing on the working 

cannula.
