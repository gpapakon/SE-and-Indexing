<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phase ambiguity
elimination device and, more particularly, to a phase ambiguity
elimination device which uses a detected synchronizing word in
eliminating phase ambiguity from a QPSK signal. The
synchronizing word may be a unique word (UW) of frame
synchronizing system used in a modulation/demodulation apparatus
of a satellite communication, quadrature phase shift keying
(QPSK) system.In a frame synchronizing system of a QPSK modulation system,
each of the Pch and Qch data signals is provided with a UW. The
UW is detected and used for phase synchronizing purposes at a
receiving side. However, there are four phase states (P, Q), (Q,
P), (P, Q) and (Q, P) due to phase slip, as described in, for
example, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 134951/1984
(JP-A-59-134951). P and Q stand for inversions of P and Q
channel signals, respectively. Therefore, when such data is
demodulated in the receiving side, there is a phase ambiguity.
In order to remove the ambiguity, it is necessary to determine
the phase of the received signals, and correct the phase, when
necessary, to a determined, correct phase. This may be achieved
by using a phase ambiguity elimination or removing device, as it 
may also be called. The phase ambiguity removing device compares
a demodulated UW with a reference UW stored in the receiving
side, calculates an error value and decides the correct phase
according to the error value.As described above, since the position of the UW in a frame
is predetermined in accordance with system criteria, subsequent
UWs can be detected at fixed intervals once a first UW is
detected.However, if there is a failure to detect the UW a change in
phase is not detected and last detected phase information is used
continuously, since there is no new phase information. As a
result, if the phase of the received data changes due to phase
slip, the phase ambiguity removing device can not properly
correct the phase for it operates on received data with erroneous
phase information. Consequently, the received data becomes
different from the transmitted data, resulting in an error.US-A-5 025 455 discloses a phase ambiguity resolution for offset QPSK modulation
systems. A demodulator for OQPSK signals modulated with two unique words
resolves eight possible combinations of phase ambiguity which may product data
error by first processing received IR and QR data in an integrated carrier
loop/symbol synchronizer using a digital Costas loop with matched filters for
correcting four of eight
