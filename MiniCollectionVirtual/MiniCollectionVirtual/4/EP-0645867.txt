<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to switching device according to the precharacterising
part of claim 1.The invention relates especially to switching devices in
circuits for high direct currents and/or high direct voltages,
such as plants for power transmission by means of
high-voltage direct current (HVDC plants/HVDC transmissions).In a plant for HVDC power transmission switchings of the direct
current in a converter station between different current
paths are made in certain operating cases.In a monopolar HVDC transmission, or during monopolar operation
of a bipolar transmission, the operating current of a
converter station flows in undisturbed operation via a
ground electrode. Normally, this ground electrode is located
at a distance from the station and is connected thereto 
through an electrode line, often of considerable length. An
HVDC station normally has a neutral busbar, by which is
meant in this application a busbar in an HVDC station which
is intended, during normal operation, to lie at a potential
near ground. Such a busbar is connected to or connectible to
the ground electrode via the electrode line. Neutral busbars
normally exist in the converter stations both in monopolar
and in bipolar HVDC transmissions.In connection with certain faults, for example an interruption
in the electrode line, it is known to temporarily connect
the neutral busbar to a station ground with the aid of
a mechanical circuit breaker, the station ground being a
ground electrode arranged in the station or near the station.
After termination of the disturbance, the circuit
breaker has.been opened, whereby the operating direct current
has been transferred from the station ground back to
the electrode line and the ordinary ground electrode. This
has caused high overvoltages to arise on the neutral busbar
because of the impedance of the electrode line, which has
necessitated overvoltage protective devices in the form of
surge arresters, which have had to be amply dimensioned both
from the point of view of voltage and energy. The overvoltage
protection devices have therefore become costly. Further,
the mechanical circuit breakers have constituted an
undesirable complication of an HVDC station.Because of the impedance of the electrode line, overvoltages
on the neutral busbar in an HVDC station can also occur at
an overcurrent on the electrode line. Also such overvoltages
necessitate amply dimensioned surge arresters in known HVDC
stations.Similar problems arise if, in case of a fault in one of the
poles of a bipolar transmission, it
