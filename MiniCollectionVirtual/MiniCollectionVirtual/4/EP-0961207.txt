<ABSTRACT>
The device includes an activity/frequency converter by neuron (2(i,j)), designed to provide at its output pulses whose frequency represents the activity of this neuron. The outputs of the converter associated with the matrix of neurons are connected to a coder (4) by means of which the pulses are given their own binary code at the neuron which causes there production. The coder (4) is connected to a bus (5) with transmits the codes to the user system (6). The system also includes an arbiter, which determines the order of succession on the bus (5) of the different codes produced by the neurons.

Apparatus for communication via a transmission bus (5) between a user
system (6) and a neural network (1) made of up of neurones connected in an

addressable matrix, said device including an activity/frequency converter for each
neurone (2 (i, j)) adapted to provide at its output pulses whose frequency represents the

activity of said neurone, the outputs of said converters associated with said neurones of
said matrix being connected to an encoder (4) by which said pulses are allocated a

binary code specific to the neurone that caused them to be produced and said encoder
(4) being connected to said bus (5) for transmitting said codes to said user system (6),

said device also including arbitration means for determining the order of succession on
said transmission bus (5) of the various codes produced by said neurones of said

network,
characterized in that
 said arbitration means comprising, for each of said converters, a
circuit (18 (i, j)) for controlling inhibition of operation of its associated converter and

blocking means (14, 15, 16, 17) connected in common to all said converters to
transmit to them a temporary blocking command, each inhibition control circuit being

adapted to detect the presence of a pulse at the output of its associated converter and,
while any such pulse is present, to activate said blocking means so that they transmit to

the other converters said command temporarily blocking their operation.
Communication apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
blocking means comprise a reference voltage source (14) connected to a voltage divider

(15, 16) having an intermediate node (17) connected to each control circuit and to a
blocking input (19 (i, j)) of each converter, and 
in that
 each control circuit is adapted to
modify the potential of said intermediate node (17) while a pulse is present at the

output of the associated converter, the modification of the potential, by activating said
blocking inputs of all the other converters, preventing the production of any pulse

thereby.
Communication apparatus as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said
voltage divider comprises the series-connected combination of a resistor (15) and a

capacitor (16) the common point of which forms said intermediate node (17) and 
in
that
 said series-connected circuit is connected between said reference voltage source
(14) and ground. 
Communication apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein each converter
comprises a Schmitt trigger (26) to whose input (27) the activity signal (V
IN
) from the
neurone connected to that converter is applied and whose output (36) is connected to

said encoder (4), said trigger (26) being connected to two hysteresis voltage sources
(VHP, VHM) between which hysteresis voltages said activity signal (V
IN
) must evolve to
cause said trigger (26) to change state and thereby determine the length and the

spacing of said pulses, said apparatus being 
characterized in that
 one of said hysteresis
voltage sources (VHM, VHP) is said intermediate node (17) of said voltage divider.
Communication apparatus as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 each
inhibition control circuit (18A) comprises a transistor (21) whose gate is connected to

said output (36A) of the associated converter (2A) and whose source-drain path is
connected between a current source (22) and said intermediate node (17).
Communication apparatus as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 each
inhibition control circuit (18B) comprises a transistor (21) whose gate is connected to

said output (36B) of the associated converter (2B) and whose source-drain path is
connected between said intermediate node (17) of said divider and ground.
Communication apparatus as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 each
inhibition control circuit (18C) comprises a capacitor (24) connected between said

output (36C) of said converter and said intermediate node (17) and a diode (25)
connected between said reference voltage source and said intermediate node (17) of

said divider.
