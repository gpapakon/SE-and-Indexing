<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the stabilization of luciferase catalyzed
luminescence. The invention relates as well to compositions and methods for
improving the lifetimes of the luminescence reaction. This invention also includes
assay kits for detection of an expressed luciferase gene used in reporter-gene
techniques.Luciferases are found in a wide variety of organisms including fireflies,
photobacteria, jellyfish and many others. Luciferases are enzymes which catalyze
the production of light by oxidizing luciferin to oxyluciferin in a process known
generally as bioluminescence.The production of photons by luciferase occurs through a two step reaction
which consumes luciferin, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and O2. In the first step,
luciferase catalyzes the formation of luciferyl adenylate from luciferin and ATP.
In this first step pyrophosphate is released and a Mg+2 cofactor or another divalent
cation is required for proper luciferase function. Upon formation, luciferyl
adenylate remains within the active site of luciferase. In the next step, luciferase
oxidizes luciferyl adenylate to an electronically excited oxyluciferin with the
consumption of oxygen. Light production occurs when the electronically excited
oxyluciferin decays to the ground state oxyluciferin. The decay from the 
excited state to the ground state occurs with the concomitant emission of a photon.
The color of the light produced differs with the source of the luciferase and appears
to be determined by differences in the structure of the various luciferases. An
example of a method using the luciferase system is disclosed in EP-A-0015 437.Luciferases have recently become useful in reporter-gene technology. In
this technique, a reporter gene, such as a luciferase encoding polynucleotide is used
as an indicator for the transcription and translation of a gene in a cellular expression
system. The reporter gene is operatively linked to a promoter that is recognized by
the cellular expression system. Other commonly used reporter genes include β-galactosidase,
and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). In a typical reporter
gene assay, a DNA vector containing the reporter gene is transfected into a cell
capable of expressing the reporter gene. After a sufficient amount of time to allow
for the expression of the reporter gene has passed, the cellular membrane is
disrupted to release the expressed gene product. The reagents necessary for the
catalytic reaction of the reporter gene are then added to the reaction solution and
