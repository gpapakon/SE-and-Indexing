<ABSTRACT>
This display case is of the kind comprising, on the one hand, a support (12) suitable for holding the spectacle lens (10) that is to be displayed and, on the other hand, two half shells (13A, 13B) mounted so as to pivot on the edge of the support (12) and each movable between a closed position, in which they come together to form a protective shell around the support (12), and an open position in which, as shown, they reveal it. In accordance with the invention the support (12) is circular in overall outline, it has no raised edge around at least part of its circumference, and it possesses locally at least three projecting pins (23, 23A, 23B) for holding the spectacle lens (10) firmly in place.

A presentation case for a spectacle lens, of the kind 
comprising on the one hand a plate (12) which is capable of receiving the 

spectacle lens (10) to be presented and on the other hand two half-shell 
portions (13A, 13B) which, mounted pivotably at the edge of the plate (12) 

at a pivot axis which is generally perpendicular to the plate are each 
movable between a closure position in which, in mutually facing 

relationship, they together form a protective shell (13) around the plate 
(12) and an open position in which in contrast they expose same, the plate 

(12) being of generally circular contour, the plate (12) being without any 
rim on two portions (15A, 15B) of its periphery which are diametrally 

oppositely disposed relative to each other, and locally having in 
projecting relationship at least three securing projections (23, 23A, 23B) 

for holding the spectacle lens (10). 
A presentation case according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the plate (12) locally has in projecting relationship right on the surface 

thereof an additional securing projection (26). 
A presentation case according to either one of claims 1 and 2 
characterised in that one at least of the securing projections (23A, 23B, 

26) that the plate (12) comprises is disposed at the end of a blade 
portion (27) which is elastically deformable radially with respect to the 

plate (12). 
A presentation case according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the plate (12) is essentially in the general shape 

of a flat disc. 
A presentation case according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the two half-shell portions (13A, 13B) are mounted 

pivotably at the same point on the plate (12).  
 
A presentation case according to claim 5 characterised in that 
the plate (12) locally has in projecting relationship at the edge of its 

periphery a back portion (16), to the back of which both of the two half-shell 
portions (13A, 13B) are pivotably mounted. 
A presentation case according to claim 6 characterised in that 
abutment means are operative between the back portion (16) and the half-shell 

portions (13A, 13B), for arresting the half-shell portions (13A, 
13B) in the open position. 
A presentation case according to claim 7 characterised in that 
said abutment means comprise, for each of the two half-shell portions 

(13A, 13B), a shoulder (44A, 44B) on the back portion (16), and a tongue 
portion (45A, 45B) which, in projecting relationship on the half-shell 

portion (13A, 13B), comes to bear against said shoulder (44A, 44B) in the 
open position. 
A presentation case according to any one of claims 6 to 8 
characterised in that the back portion (16) is in two pieces (30, 31), 

namely a piece (30) which, moulded with the plate (12), is in one piece 
therewith, and a piece (31) on which the two half-shell portions (13A, 

13B) are pivotably mounted. 
A presentation case according to any one of claims 6 to 9 
characterised in that, at a position in diametrally opposite relationship 

to the back portion (16), the plate (12) locally has in projecting 
relationship at the edge of its periphery a rim (17) on which the two 

half-shell portions (13A, 13B) each engage by way of a recess (18A, 18B) 
in the closure position. 
A presentation case according to any one of claims 5 to 10 
characterised in that, in the open position, the two half-shell portions 

(13A, 13B) are generally aligned with each other tangentially with respect 

to the plate (12).  
 
A presentation case according to any one of claims 1 to 11 
characterised in that each of the two half-shell portions (13A, 13B) 

comprises two main walls (39, 39') which, generally parallel to each other, 
extend generally parallel to the plate (12), and a side wall (40) which, 

generally perpendicularly to the plate (12), connects the main walls (39, 
39') to each other in a pocket configuration. 
A presentation case according to claim 12 characterised in 
that, over a part at least of the contour of the main walls (39, 39') as 

considered from their pivot axis, the side wall (40) extends generally 
perpendicularly to the free edges (41, 41') of said main walls (39, 39'). 
A presentation case according to either one of claims 12 and 
13 characterised in that the main walls (39, 39') of the half-shell 

portions (13A, 13B) are locally prolonged by ears (42, 42') for pivotal 
engagement thereof on an axis portion (34). 
A presentation case according to any one of claims 1 to 14 
characterised in that latching means are associated with the half-shell 

portions (13A, 13B) for releasable locking thereof in the closure 
position. 
A presentation case according to claims 12 and 15 in 
combination characterised in that said latching means are carried by two 

tongue portions (46A, 46B) which, each locally prolonging one of the main 
walls (39, 39') of the half-shell portions (13A, 13B) along the free edge 

(41, 41') of same, are in superposed relationship in the closure position.
