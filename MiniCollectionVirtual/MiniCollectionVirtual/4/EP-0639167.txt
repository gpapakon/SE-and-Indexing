Composting plant having 

a) a central ventilation device (10, K1, 12, 
K2, K3, 14) which is constructed as a regulated air 

circulating system; 
b) a plurality of separate reactors (1, 2, ... 
N) which can be individually connected (L1

) to the central 
ventilation device (10, K1, 12, K2, K3, 14); and 
c) means (Fig. 2) which are designed for the 
independent and individual adjustability per 

reactor (1, 2, ... N) of the process parameters 
determining the microbial metabolic rate and for this 

purpose 
c1)a controllable diversion loop serving as 
bypass (K3, 14; L20, R22; L32, R34, R28; L24, R30, 

L31; R26, L25, L14, V16, R18) and/or the reactor's own 
circulating air conduction (L20, R22, L32, R34, R28, 

L24, R30, L31; R26, L25, L14, V16, R18). 
Composting plant according to claim 1, in which the 
central ventilation system (10, K1, 12, K2, K3, 14) 

has a circulating air conditioning system (10) for 
conditioning the temperature, humidity and/or gas 

composition. 
Composting plant according to claim 2, in which the 
circulating air conditioning (10) has means for 

condensate separation, heat recovery, filtering for 
odoriferous substances and/or washing for airborne 

hazardous materials. 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims with pipes (L1, L2, LN) for the infeed and 

discharge of partial flows from/into the central  
 

circulating air to/from the separate reactors (1, 2, 
... N). 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, having set-up means for the individual setting 

in keeping with requirements of the temperature, 
humidity and/or gas composition of the process air as 

a partial stream of the circulating air per reactor 
(1, 2, ... N). 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims having a separate air circulating system (Fig 

2) for at least one or more, preferably all, reactors 
(1, 2, ... N) which can be connected optionally, 

preferably through regulating valves (R1 to RN), to 
the central air circulating system (10, K1, 12, K2, 

K3, 14). 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, in which the reactors (1 to N) are each 

equipped with a separate, controllable fresh air 
infeed (L11, R12). 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, in which the volumes of exhaust air 

corresponding to the fresh air infeed can be led off 
through the central air circulating system (10, K1, 

12, K2, K3, 14). 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, having control means which control the partial 

streams of all connected or connectable reactors (1, 
2, ... N) in a relationship to the total volume of the 

central air treatment system in such a way that 
unproblematic conditioning of the circulating air is 

guaranteed.  
 
Composting plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, in which the units controlling the determining 

parameters of the process, especially the circulating 
air conditioning system (10), all ventilators and 

regulating valves, can be controlled manually or with 
computer assistance.
