<ABSTRACT>
Process for the isomerisation of relatively unsubstituted external olefins to more substituted external olefins and/or internal olefins, in the absence of diolefins, in the presence of a catalyst based on palladium deposited on a support, the said catalyst being, before it is charged into the reactor, treated with at least one sulphur compound diluted in a solvent, and then activated under neutral or reducing atmosphere between 20 and 300 DEG C, 1 and 50 bars and with an HSV of 50 to 600 h
<
-1
>
. The catalyst containing 0.05 to 10 % of sulphur (by weight) is brought into contact with the feedstock and hydrogen between 20 and 200 DEG C, 1 and 50 bars, an HSV of 0.5 to 10 h
<
-1
>
 and an H2/olefins molar ratio of 0.01 to 1.

Process for the isomerisation of external olefins
contained in a feedstock of more substituted

external olefins and/or internal olefins, said
liquid feedstock being substantially free of

diolefins, in the presence of a palladium based
catalyst and in the presence of hydrogen, the

isomerisation conditions of the process
corresponding to a temperature of between 20°C and

200°C, a pressure of between 1 and 50 bars, a VVH of
between 0.5 and 10 h
-1
 and an H
2
/olefin molar ratio

catalyst is treated, before loading into the
isomerisation reactor, with at least one sulphur-containing

compound dissolved in a solvent and in
which the catalyst containing 0.05 % to 10 % by

weight of sulphur is loaded into the reactor and
activated in a neutral or reducing atmosphere at a

temperature of between 20°C and 300°C, a pressure of
between 1 and 50 bars and a VVH of between 50 and

600 h
-1

contact with said activated catalyst under

isomerisation conditions.
