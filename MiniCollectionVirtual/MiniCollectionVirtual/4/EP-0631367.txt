<ABSTRACT>
A drive system comprising an integrated gearhead motor system that produces 
relatively high torque output with minimal backlash. The present invention uses two 

axially mounted electric or air motors and gearhead assemblies integrated into a single 
unit. The two 
motor and gearhead assemblies are connected to concentric output drive 
shafts, and each output shaft mates to a respective gear of a split gear assembly. The 

split gear assembly is coupled to a drive shaft of a device that is to be driven by the 
system. A tachometer is coupled between the first motor and a position sensor is 

coupled to the drive shaft of the device that is to be driven. The tachometer and 
position sensor are coupled to a controller that is used to control the respective torques 

provided by the two motors in response to rate and position signals provided thereby. 
By controlling the relative amount of torque provided by the two motors, the split gear 

assembly removes the backlash from the gearheads and gear interfaces to the drive shaft 
of the device that is to be driven. The present invention incorporates the two motors 

and two gearhead assemblies into a single assembly, reducing weight and space 
requirements. The design of the present invention also permits retrofitting of the drive 

system into existing single motor drive systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to motors, and more particularly, to an 
integrated gearhead motor assembly incorporating two motors and two gearhead 
assemblies that provides for relatively high torque output with minimal backlash for use 
in precision servo systems. In the past, hydraulically controlled drive systems have been employed to 
provide for a drive system that produces a large amount of torque. Such drive systems 
are used in antenna control systems, for example. The hydraulic drive systems inherently 
produce little or no backlash, and are therefore very accurate when used to control 
the pointing of an antenna. However, conventional hydraulic drive systems are prone 
to leakage which is a definite drawback. Previous anti-backlash electric motor drive systems required two independent 
motors acting on a drive assembly. The only known single assembly electrical drive 
device developed for low backlash applications is a direct drive torquer motor, but this 
device provides only limited torque output. A backlash-free drive having two coaxial wave drives is disclosed in SU-A-727 919. Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an integrated 
electric gearhead motor assembly incorporating two motors and two gearhead assemblies 
integrated into a single housing that provides for relatively high torque output and 
minimal backlash. It is a further objective of the present invention to provide for an 
integrated gearhead motor assembly incorporating either two electric motors or two air 
motors and two gearhead assemblies integrated into a single housing.  
 In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided a gearhead motor system as specified in Claim 1 
hereinafter. In order to meet the above and other objectives, there 
is provided an integrated gearhead motor system that 
produces relatively high torque output with minimal 
backlash. The system may incorporate AC or DC electric 
motors or air motors, for example. In one embodiment, the 
system uses two axially mounted electric motor and gearhead 
assemblies. The two motor and gearhead assemblies are 
connected to concentric output drive shafts, and each output 
shaft mates to a respective one of the gears of a split gear 
assembly. The split gear assembly is coupled to a gear of 
the drive shaft of a device that is to be driven by the 
integrated gearhead motor assembly. A tachometer is 
coupled between the first motor and a controller that is 
used to control the respective torques provided by the two
