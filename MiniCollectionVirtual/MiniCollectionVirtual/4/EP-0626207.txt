<ABSTRACT>
An adapter for a centrifuge tube comprises two adapter 
segments (12,14), each of which has an exterior surface and a mating 

surface thereon. Each segment has a pair of indentations (26A,26B) in the 
mating surface. When the segments are joined along their 

mating surfaces the indentations cooperate to define a pair of 
recesses therein. Each recess so defined is configured to 

surround totally a centrifuge tube (T) disposed therein. Each 
recess has an axis (A2) extending therethrough, with the axes of the 

recesses (60A,60B) being collinear. The collinear axes of the 
recesses are 

aligned parallel to the axis of rotation (VCL) of the rotor, and 
preferably also align collinearly with the axis of the rotor 

cavity in which the adapter is disposed. Each adapter segment (12,14) 
is fabricated of a material that has sufficient strength to 

withstand the vertical forces created by the pressure of a 
liquid under centrifugation. At least one of the adapter 

segments has an effective weight sufficient to balance forces 
created by the pressure of a liquid carried in the tubes under 

centrifugation that act transversely to the central axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
an adapter for holding a pair of centrifuge tubes in a centrifuge
rotor cavity, and in particular, to an adapter having two
segments which, upon mating, cooperate to define a pair of
tube-receiving recesses.PCT publication WO
91/06373 discloses an adapter for supporting a sealed
centrifuge tube within a cavity of a centrifuge rotor. The
adapter comprises a pair of matable adapter segments, each of
which has an indentation therein. When the segments are 
joined along mating surfaces the indentation in each segment
cooperate to define a recess having a size and shape that
(within a certain range of manufacturing tolerances) closely
corresponds to the size and shape of some portion or all of the
sealed centrifuge tube. US-A-3,674,197
and
US-A-4,692,137 are each exemplary of an
adapter formed from two segments.WO-A-92/19382 discloses an adapter for holding a centrifuge
tube in a centrifuge rotor cavity comprising two
segments which may be hinged along a hinge axis that
extends perpendicular to the axis of the adapter. The
inboard segment is subjected to deflections and stress
as set out above.In some instances it may be desirable to increase the
number of sealed tubes that a given rotor can carry.
US-A-4,306,676 and US-A-4,360,150
are each directed to an arrangement facilitating the
accommodation of two or more containers within a single
cavity of a vertical angle centrifuge rotor.
US-A-3,050,239; US-A-3,674,198; US-A-3,891,140;
US-A-3,905,772; US-A-4,032,066; and
US-A-4,141,489 each discloses an adapter arrangement
which carries many tubes in a swinging bucket centrifuge
rotor. It is an object of the present invention to improve the
performance of an adapter for supporting a pair of centrifuge
tubes so that the adapter will maintain complete
containment of the tubes during centrifugation.This object is solved, according to the invention, with
the features of claim 1.The present invention is directed to an adapter for
supporting a pair of closed centrifuge tubes each having a
predetermined size and configuration within a single cavity in
a vertical angle centrifuge rotor. The rotor is rotatable to a
predetermined maximum speed. The adapter has a central axis
extending therethrough that, in use, aligns in parallel
relationship both with the axis of the rotor cavity in which the
adapter is disposed and, thus, with the axis of rotation of the
vertical angle rotor.The adapter comprises a first and a second adapter
segment, each of which has an exterior surface and a mating
surfac
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An adapter (10) for supporting a closed centrifuge
tube (T) within a cavity (C) of a vertical angle

centrifuge rotor (V) for rotation about an axis of
rotation (VCL), the adapter (10) comprising:


a first, inboard, adapter segment (12) and a second,
outboard, adapter segment (14), each segment (12,14)

having an exterior surface (16) and a mating surface
(18) thereon, each segment (12,14) having an indentation

(26A) in the mating surface (18) thereof, the
indentation (26A) in each segment (12,14) being

shaped such that when the segments (12,14) are
joined along their mating surfaces (18) the indentations

(26A) cooperate to define a recess (60A) able
to totally surround a centrifuge tube (T) disposed

therein, the recess (60A) having an axis (A
r
) therethrough,
the axis (A
r
) of the recess (60A) being
parallel to the axis of rotation (VCL),
the adapter segments (12,14) being fabricated of a
material that has sufficient strength to withstand

vertical forces (F
T
) created by the pressure of a
liquid in the tube (T) while under centrifugation,
at least the first, inboard, segment (12) of the
adapter (10) having an effective weight sufficient

to balance forces (F
T
) created by the pressure of a
liquid carried in the tube (T) under centrifugation

that act transversely to the axis of the recess
(60A), 
so that, in use with the adapter (10) inserted into
a cavity (C) of a rotor (V) with the mating surfaces

(18) of the adapter segments (12,14) being in contacting
relationship with each other, the effective

weight of the inboard segment (12) while under centrifugation
is sufficient to maintain the mating

surfaces (18) of the adapter segments (12,14) in
such contacting relationship,
characterized in that
each segment (12,14) has a second indentation (26B)
in the mating surface (18), the second indentations

(26B) defining a second recess (60B) able to totally
surround a centrifuge tube (T) when the segments

(12,14) are joined, the second recess (60B) having
an axis (A
r
) being collinear to the axis (A
r
) of the
first recess (60A), wherein the two indentations

(26A,26B) of each segment (12,14) are separated by a
web portion (28) being integral with the adapter

(10).
The adapter of claim 1, wherein the first, inboard,
segment (12) has two openings (62) in the

first indentation (26A) and second indentation
(26B), respectively, located in areas in which the

centrifuge tubes (T) impart stress while being spun,
thus reducing the deflection of the adapter (10) in

that area.
