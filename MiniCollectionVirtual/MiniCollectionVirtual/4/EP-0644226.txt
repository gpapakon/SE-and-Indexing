<ABSTRACT>
In order to obtain a film having a practical 
strength and a high tearableness using a general-purpose 

thermoplastic resin, not less than two kinds of 
thermoplastic resins having different repeating units, 

such as a styrene polymer and an olefin polymer are 
subjected to a T-die method or film blowing method 

without stretching the materials. In the continuous 
phases of a film thus obtained, dispersed phases having 

an average aspect ratio of not less than 3 and a 
thickness of not more than 1 µm scatter in layers. 

The ratio of the continuous phases to the dispersed 
phases is 35-98:2-65 (wt%). The maximum tearing 

torque of the film is not more than 60 g.cm/µm, and 
the maximum tearing tensile force thereof not more 

than 10 g/µm, the film being torn substantially linearly 
in at least one direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an easy tearable
film useful as a packaging material and to a method of
producing the same.As packaging materials, there are generally used
biaxially-stretched films such as polypropylene film
and polyethylene terephthalate film. These films,
however, are poor in tear properties.There is also known scored films to improve the
tear properties of the films. Still, when a pouch is
formed with a scored film, an article is affected adversely
by the exterior atmosphere, or the exterior
atmosphere is adversely affected by an article, in some
cases, depending on the species of the content article.On the other hand, in order to provide a readily
openable packaging bag, there are also known films
which are subjected to stretching in one direction to
afford tear properties thereto. For example, Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open Nos. 125844/1986 (61-125844),
208349/1987 (62-208349), 242746/1990 (2-242746)
and 258342/1990 (2-258342) disclose a packaging
material wherein a film extensively stretched in one 
direction is laminated on a paper or film as a base
material.Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.
22537/1989 (64-22537) discloses a method of producing
an easy tearable film which comprises mixing or blending
olefinic polymers such as a low-density polyethylene
or a high-density polyethylene in a predetermined
proportion, extrusion-molding the mixture and stretching
the resulting film in the radial direction to
provide a flexible film having an islands-sea structure.
This film, however, not only is poor in heat
resistance and mechanical strength but also has a large
tear resistance when torn by hand.Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.
180976/1990 (2-180976) also discloses an easy tearable
film. However, a copolymer of ethylene component and a
cyclic olefin of a specific structure is required to
produce such a film and the film is poor in heat resistance.Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 17632/1978 (53-17632)
and 35832/1978 (53-35832) disclose a directly
tearable film comprising polypropylene and an ethylene-α-olefin
copolymer or others.As thus described, when tear properties are imparted
to a film by means of stretching treatment, a
stretching step for stretching the film in one direction
is required, thus the resultant film is high-costed 
and can be torn only in one direction. Further,
even when the film is subjected to the stretching
treatment, it is occasionally hard to tear without
forming notches, and whiskers or palpi are branched
from the film with tearing
