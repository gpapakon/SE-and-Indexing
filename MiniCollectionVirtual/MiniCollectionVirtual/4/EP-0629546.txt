<ABSTRACT>
The hull described above is a hull which surrounds the boat propeller and together with the propeller forms a sort of turbine. One of the characteristics of the construction is that, when the hull leaves the water, the water eddies are greatly reduced in such a manner that the bottom of seas or rivers which are not very deep is protected from the excavation caused by the eddies due to the movement of the propeller of boats.
