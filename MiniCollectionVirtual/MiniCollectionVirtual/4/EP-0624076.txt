<ABSTRACT>
A catheter comprises a catheter body (10) having a proximal end, a distal end, and an electrode array disposed near the distal end(12). The electrode array includes a plurality of isolated electrode terminals (18). The electrode array and a common electrode (16) are connected to a high frequency power supply (32) and the common electrode (16) may be located on the catheter, may be secured separately to a patient's skin, or may be formed as part of a movable guidewire. By contacting the electrode array against a target location in the patient's body, the target location may be selectively heated, with current density being contacted at the points of contact between the electrode terminals (18) and the tissue or stenotic material. For example, by positioning the common electrode within a stenotic region and contacting a leading surface of the stenotic region with the electrode array, the stenotic material can be heated by applying a high frequency voltage between the electrode array and the common electrode. The stenotic region can thus be recanalized by advancing the distal end of the catheter body through the heated stenotic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
construction and use of catheters for interventional and
diagnostic procedures. In particular, the present
invention relates to apparatus for advancing
catheters through restrictions and occlusions within body
lumens and cavities.Atherosclerosis is a form of arteriosclerosis
which is characterized by irregularly distributed
deposits on the walls of a patient's arteries. Such
deposits frequently fibrose and calcify over time,
seriously compromising the patient's health.A number of catheter-based approaches have been
developed for diagnosing and treating atherosclerosis and
other forms of arteriosclerosis. The most common
interventional technique for treating atherosclerosis is
balloon angioplasty where a balloon-tipped catheter is
introduced to the vascular system, and the balloon
expanded within a region of stenosis. Other
interventional techniques include atherectomy, where, for
example, a catheter having a cup-shaped rotating cutter
is introduced to the vascular system and used to severe
and capture at least a portion of the stenotic material.
Other interventional techniques include laser ablation,
mechanical abrasion, chemical dissolution, and the like.
Catheter-based diagnostic techniques include ultrasonic
imaging where an ultrasonic transducer disposed at the
distal end of a vascular catheter is introduced to the
region of stenosis. With most of these techniques, it is necessary
to advance the distal end of the catheter at least partly
through the stenosed region before the interventional or
diagnostic procedure can be commenced. While such
initial advancement is often not a problem, it can be
very problematic when the occlusion is severe and little
or no lumen remains to receive the catheter. Under such
circumstances, it is necessary to at least partly
recanalize the occlusion before the catheter procedure
can begin.A number of methods for recanalizing severe
occlusions have been proposed, including the use of hot-tipped
catheters, laser catheters, and drill-tipped
catheters. In general, these approaches rely on very
aggressive treatment of the stenotic material to open up
a passage, where such aggressive techniques can expose
the blood vessel wall to significant injury, for example,
vessel perforation. The risk of injury is exacerbated by
the unconstrained path which the catheter can follow.An improved technique for advancing an
angioplasty catheter into and optionally through a severe
occlusions is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,998,933
