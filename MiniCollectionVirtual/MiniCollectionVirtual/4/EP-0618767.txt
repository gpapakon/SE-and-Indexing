<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is intended to provide an
insecticidal and acaricidal composition having excellent
insecticidal and acaricidal activities.US-A-5,120,721 discloses an acaricidal composition
comprising synergistically effective amounts of two compounds.
The compounds are:
(a) either α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl 2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylate
or a α-cyano-3-phenoxy-benzyl N-(2-chloro-α,α,α-trifluoro-p-tolyl)-valinate;
and(b) O,O,O',O'-tetraethyl S,S'-methylene bis(phosphorodithioate).The present inventors made study in order to develop an
excellent insecticidal and acaricidal agent and, as a result,
found that the composition shown below exhibits striking
insecticidal and acaricidal effects by the synergistic actions
of the active ingredients contained therein. The finding has
led to the completion of the present invention. The present
invention provides an insecticidal and acaricidal composition
comprising, as active ingredients,
α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl 2,2,3,3,-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylate
(hereinafter referred to as
"compound 1") andethyl (Z)-N-benzyl-N-[{methyl(1-methylthioethylideneamino-oxycarbonyl)amino}thio]-β-alaninate
(commonly
called "alanycarb" and hereinafter referred to as "compound 2"),
in synergistically insecticidally and/or acaricidally effective
amounts and further comprising agriculturally and/or
horticulturally acceptable carriers.The invention also provides a method for controlling
insects and acarines using such a composition.There are shown below the structural formulae of compound
1 and compound 2, which are both the active ingredients of the
insecticidal and acaricidal composition according to the present
invention (hereinafter 
referred to as the present invention composition).
The compound 1 includes stereoisomers. The
compound 1 used in the present invention includes any
isomers having insecticidal activities and mixtures
thereof.The compound 1 includes, for example, the
following compounds.
(RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl 2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylate
(commonly
called fenpropathrin, hereinafter referred to
as "compound 1-a") (S)-α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl 2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylateThe compound 2 can be produced by the process
described in USP 4444786.The injurious insects and acarines which can
be controlled or exterminated by the present invention
composition, include, for example, the followings.Scirtothripsdorsalis (yellow tea thrips),
Frankliniellaintonsa (flower thrips) and the like.
HEMIPTERAAphids such as Myzuspersicae (green
