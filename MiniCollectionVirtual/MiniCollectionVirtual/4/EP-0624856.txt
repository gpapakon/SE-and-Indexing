<ABSTRACT>
What is proposed is a tachograph for motor vehicles which, by the use of a microprocessor, serves for determining the distances covered, the running speeds and at least the work-time data, such as driving periods, rest periods, etc. The output of the value determined takes place on record charts (5, 6) and in semiconductor memories of data cards (3, 4) assigned to the drivers. The centring and take-up means (7) for the record charts (5, 6) and the wells (19, 20) for receiving the data cards (3, 4) are arranged jointly in a drawer (2) guided in the housing (1) of the tachograph and interlockable with the housing (1).

<CLAIMS>
Tachograph for motor vehicles having a microprocessor
for determining driving data such as distance travelled and

speed from sensor signals and also for supplying working-time
data such as driving time or rest time etc., having

slots (19, 20) for data cards with semiconductor memories
(3, 4), which are allocated to the drivers and can be

inserted into the tachograph, and having a device for the
visual display of determined data on a recording medium (5,

6), characterized

in that tachograph discs (5, 6) are provided as the
recording medium,
in that centring and driving means (7), which are driven
with the correct time by a clockwork, for the tachograph

discs (5, 6) are associated with a carrier movable relative
to the housing (1) of the tachograph,
in that the carrier can be locked to the housing (1) of the
tachograph, and
in that the slots (19, 20) for receiving the data cards (3,
4) are designed such that they can be closed so as to be

inaccessible, by the locking of the carrier to the housing
(1).
Tachograph for motor vehicles according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that the carrier is designed as a drawer (2) mounted
slidably in the housing (1) of the tachograph.
Tachograph for motor vehicles according to Claim 2,

characterized

in that the tachograph discs (5, 6), and their recording
bases (16, 17), and the slots (19, 20) for receiving the

data cards (3, 4) are arranged one beside the other in
planes situated substantially at right angles to one 

another.
Tachograph for motor vehicles according to Claim 2,

characterized

in that the tachograph discs (5, 6) and the slots (19, 20)
are arranged in planes inclined with respect to one

another.
Tachograph for motor vehicles according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that the scanning devices associated with the data cards
(3, 4) are fixedly arranged in the housing (1) of the

tachograph.
Tachograph for motor vehicles according to Claim 2,

characterized

in that the front wall of the tachograph is formed by a
wall part (18) fixed to the housing and a wall part (9)

associated with the drawer (2), and
in that at least one lock (11) is arranged in the wall part
(9) of the drawer (2).
