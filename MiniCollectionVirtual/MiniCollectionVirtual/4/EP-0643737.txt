<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the form in which polymers are provided, said polymers for use, in combination with a liquid medium, to form a gel from which products such as liquid detergents, cosmetics and toiletries can be produced. The invention provides the polymer, which is typically a carbomer or cross-polyacrylate in a granulated, pelletised or tablet form rather than in the conventional fine powdered form. This conversion of the polymer into either of a granular, pelletised or tablet form is shown to improve the handling of the dry polymer and mitigate many of the problems with the conventional powder and further to improve the rate of blending of the polymer with the liquid medium to form the required gel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to carboxylic acid polymer
compositions and particularly relates to powdered concentrates of
acrylic acid polymers and their use to prepare gels of diluted and
neutralised polymer. These are hereinafter referred to as
carbomers, a term defined in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient
Handbook as a homopolymer of acrylic acid cross-linked with an
allyl ether of pentaerythritol or an allyl ether of sucrose.The carbomers to which the invention relates are widely used as
thickeners, stabilisers and emulsifiers in many industries. Said
carbomers are produced and sold under a number of trade names for
example Carbopol (B F Goodrich), Acrisint (Sigma), Pemulen (B F
Goodrich) Junlon (Nihon Kogakyu) etc. They are however most
often referred to by the generic term of carbomer as developed by
the Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association (CTFA) and it
is this name referred to in this application.Said carbomers so described are supplied in the form of very fine
powders with poor flow properties, and handling of these products
is not easy. However, it has always been considered that the
products must be in the form of very fine powder if complete
wetting and reasonably rapid hydration of each particle is to take
place when the products are added to a liquid medium such as water
to form a gel from which products such as liquid detergents,
cosmetics, toiletries or pharmaceutical products can be made. A
consequence of the products being in the form of a very fine
powder is that they have a pronounced tendency to dust and fly
about the work place even when care is taken to minimise this. It is conventionally regarded therefore that, despite the handling
difficulties, the products must be supplied in the form of fine
powders as, when they are to be converted to a gel, and in the initial
stage of hydration for this conversion i.e. wetting of the powders,
the formation of a very stiff gel on the outside of the powder
particles occurs which delays and restricts the entry of further water
to hydrate the remainder of the particle. The stiff gel on the
outside of the particle therefore tends to prevent further water
ingress into the particle, thereby retarding the formation of a
smooth gel. In addition agglomerates of the powder particles form
lumps which increases the problem of wetting out and dispersion.Furthermore, when disturbed, the dry powder tends to develop
strong electrostatic charges which impairs further the ability of the
powder to flow in the required direction and, in the extreme,

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing an end product in the form of any of a
liquid detergent, cosmetic, toiletry, pharmaceutical or other end

product or into an intermediate therefor from a carbomer within the
meaning developed by the C.T.F.A. 
characterised in that
 the process
includes the steps of forming the carbomer into a granular,

pelletised or tablet form, converting the carbomer into a gel by the
addition of a liquid medium thereto, neutralising the resultant gel

and forming the gel into the end product.
A process according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the liquid
medium is any of water, an organic solvent, or a blend of a polar

hydroxylic solvent and non-swelling solvent.
A process according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 said
carbomer is in granular form.
A process according to claim 3 
characterised in that
 the
granulation of the carbomer includes the compression of an initial

powder form of the product to form a flake and subsequent
breaking of the flake into granules of the required dimension by

passing the flake through a plurality of sieves.
A process according to claim 3 
characterised in that
 a liquid is
added to the carbomer in a powder form to swell the same and the

product is then dried to form granules.
A process according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the
carbomer in powder form is formed into the granular, pelletised or

tablet form.
