<ABSTRACT>
The use of thermoplastic moulding compositions comprising   A) from 32.5 to 74.5 parts by weight of polyalkylene terephthalate,    B) from 5 to 20 parts by weight of pentabromobenzyl acrylate, C) from 0.5 to 7.5 parts by weight of antimony trioxide or antimony pentoxide, and   D) from 10 to 40 parts by weight of reinforcing agents,  where the sum A + B + C + D is 100, and where up to 20 parts by weight of polyalkylene terephthalate may be replaced by aromatic polycarbonates and/or graft polymer, and where from 1 to 10 parts by weight (based on 100 parts by weight of A + B + C + D) of polyolefins can be added, for the production of flame-retardant mouldings having high tracking resistance.

<CLAIMS>
Use of thermoplastic moulding compositions consisting
of


A) 32.5 to 74.5 parts by weight polyalkylene
terephthalate,
B) 5 to 20 parts by weight pentabromobenzyl
acrylate,
C) 0.5 to 7.5 parts by weight antimony trioxide or

antimony pentoxide and
D) 10 to 40 parts by weight of reinforcing agents,

the sum of A + B + C + D totalling 100,

and with up to 25 parts by weight polyalkylene
terephthalate being replaceable by aromatic

polycarbonate and/or graft polymer, and wherein 1 to
10 parts by weight (based on 100 parts by weight

A+B+C+D) polyolefins can be added,
for the production of moulded articles which have a
high tracking resistance and are flame-resistant.
Use according to claim 1,

polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate
or mixtures thereof 

being used as component A).
Use according to claim 1, up to 20 parts by weight of
component A being replaceable by reprocessed

polyalkylene terephthalate and/or by aromatic
polycarbonate.
Use according to claim 1, glass fibres being used as
component D).
Track-resistant, flame-resistant moulded articles,
capable of being produced from moulding compositions

according to claim 1.
