<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of dibenzylamine through hydrogenation of 

benzaldehyde in the presence of ammonia and a catalyst 
containing palladium using a small amount of solvent or 

dispersion medium. 
With the process according to the invention 
dibenzylamine can be prepared with high selectivity in a 

relatively short reaction time and with complete 
conversion of the benzaldehyde in a particular 

commercially attractive process. In the process according 
to the invention, use is preferably made of a palladium-carbon 

catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for 
preparation of dibenzylamine through the hydrogenation of 
benzaldehyde in the presence of ammonia and a catalyst 
containing palladium. Such a process is known from WO-A-9313047. In the known process the reaction is carried out 
in a homogenous solution of benzaldehyde in methanol. In 
order to safeguard a homogeneous solution relatively high 
amounts of solvents (850 wt% methanol calculated with 
respect to benzaldehyde) are used, which leads to a 
commercially less attractive process in view of e.g. low 
produciton capacities and high destillation costs. 
Moreover a relatively large amount of catalyst is used (2 
wt.% calculated with respect to benzaldehyde). The invention provides a process which does not 
have the above-mentioned disadvantages and with which 
dibenzylamine can be obtained with a high selectivity 
(>90%) with complete conversion of the benzaldehyde in a 
particularly attractive commercial process. According to the invention this is accomplished 
in that the reaction is performed in the presence of a 
solvent or dispersion medium in an amount of 3-60 wt.% 
calculated with respect to benzaldehyde. It was found that, when using small amounts of 
solvent, a two-phase system, consisting of an agueous 
phase (containing the catalyst as a solid) and an organic 
phase, is formed at least at the end of the reaction. In 
addition, it was found that the reaction can be carried 
out with very small amounts of solvent (less than 40 wt.% 
calculated with respect to benzaldehyde) so that high  
 
production capacities can be achieved. Moreover, a simple 
recovery procedure can be accomplished. Examples of suitable solvents are lower alcohols 
such as methanol and ethanol. Furthermore, it was found 
that the reaction can be carried out without a separate 
solvent being used. In that case, only a dispersion medium 
is present in the reaction mixture. The reaction then 
takes place in a two-phase system from the beginning. In principle, any liquid not completely miscible 
with benzaldehyde or dibenzylamine can be used as the 
dispersion medium. Water is preferably used as the 
dispersion medium. The advantage of this is that, at the 
end of the hydrogenation, a 2-phase system is obtained 
with almost all the dibenzylamine formed present in the 
organic phase. The aqueous phase, in which the catalyst is 
included and in which virtually no dibenzylamine or other 
organic components are present, can, if required, be 
recirculated as such. The aqueous phase can
