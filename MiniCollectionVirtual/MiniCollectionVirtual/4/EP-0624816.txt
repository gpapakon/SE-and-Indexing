<ABSTRACT>
A cut end (18) of a web (14) is held by a vacuum 
shuttle head (105, 106, 108, 136, 138) and a central vacuum 

finger (114-124) holds a central tongue (22) of the web 
during insertion into a preassembled cartridge (50, 52, 26). 

During winding the cartridge is rotated (174-184) to avoid 
scraping the web on the cartridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns apparatus and methods for
winding lengths of material onto spools. More particularly,
the invention concerns such apparatus and methods for
winding elongated webs, such as strips of photographic film,
onto a spool enclosed within a light tight cartridge.Conventional 35mm film cartridges comprise a
cylindrical metal shell with formed lips covered by strips
of velvet material which serve as a lightlock to prevent
light from entering the cartridge and exposing the enclosed
spool of film, plus annular metal end caps staked onto each
end of the metal shell. As shown in commonly assigned U.S.
Patent 2,940,232, the trailer end of the film is taped to
the core of the spool. The spool of film is wound and then
inserted axially into a preformed assembly of the metal
shell, lightlock and one end cap, with the leader of the
film strip extending through the lightlock, after which the
second end cap is installed to complete the cartridge. An
alternative approach to loading such a cartridge is shown in
U.S. Patents 3,586,258 and 3,910,516 which describe
processes in which a guide tongue is inserted between the
strips of velvet lightlock material of a fully assembled
cartridge. An end of a film strip is inserted along the
guide tongue and engaged with features on the spool of the
cartridge, after which winding proceeds through the
lightlock to the spool.Various modifications to this familiar film cartridge
have been suggested in the literature over the years as 
results of efforts to simplify and improve the structure of
the cartridge and the apparatus and process for assembling
and loading the cartridge. Recently, however, an improved
cartridge has been developed which comprises a pair of
mating cartridge halves, which may be injection molded and
which totally enclose a spool for film. An elongated, axial
slot is provided between the halves to permit film to be
inserted into or withdrawn from the cartridge, the slot
being provided with a pivotable lock or door to replace the
conventional velvet lightlock. One example of a cartridge
of this general type is shown in U.S. Patent 4,333,615.Figure 1 illustrates a web 10 of a material such as
photographic film, the web having longitudinal edges 12, 14
extending between a leader end 16 which will extend first
from the completed film cartridge to engage a camera, and a
trailer end 18 which will engage the spool for the film. A
plurality of imaging areas 20 are spaced along web 10
between ends 16, 18 in the familiar manner. Leader end 18
is formed of a

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for spooling web (10) of predeterminate
length, said apparatus being of the type including a

supply of said web, a winding station for receiving a
cartridge (50,52) comprising a

longitudinal opening (76) through which an end of said web may be
inserted and enclosing an empty spool (26) having a

core (28) with means (34,36) for engaging said end (18) of
said web, means for rotating said spool to draw said web

through said longitudinal opening and wind said web onto
said spool and means for guiding said web from said

supply to said winding station;

vacuum means (105) for gripping said web (10) between
said supply and said winding station, said vacuum means

comprising a first surface through which vacuum is
applied to grip said web behind said end;
vacuum finger means (124) extendable from said
vacuum means for gripping said end, said vacuum finger

means comprising a second surface through which vacuum
is applied to grip said end when said vacuum finger

means is extended;
means for extending and withdrawing said vacuum
finger means (124); and
means for moving said vacuum means and said vacuum
finger means (124) between a first position where said

web (10) may be gripped by said vacuum means and a
second position where said end may be inserted, while

gripped by said vacuum finger means, through said
longitudinal opening into engagement with said means for

engaging; 
characterized by
means (180, 186, 188) for rotating said cartridge (50,52) during
winding of said web (10) onto said spool (26) to prevent

contact of said web (10) with said longitudinal opening of said cartridge as said web

passes through said longitudinal opening (76) and as the diameter of the web wound on the core increases.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said vacuum
means (105) comprises a pair of tines (106,108)

extending on either side of said vacuum finger means
(124), said first surface extending along each of said

tines (106,108), and means mounted on
said tines for supporting said vacuum finger means for

movement between said tines.
A process for spooling web (10) of predeterminate
length including the steps of providing a cartridge comprising a

longitudinal opening (76) through which a leading end of said web
may be inserted and

(50,52) enclosing an empty spool (26) having a core (28)
with means (34,36) for engaging the leading end (18) of

said web (10) ; inserting said leading end through said
longitudinal opening into engagement with said spool;

and rotating said spool to draw said web through said
longitudinal opening and wind said web onto said spool,


characterized by the step
 of:

rotating said cartridge (50,52) during winding of
said web (10) onto said spool (26) to prevent contact of

said web (10) with said longitudinal opening of said cartridge (50,52) as said web
(10) passes through said longitudinal opening (76) and as the diameter of the web wound on the core increases
