<ABSTRACT>
Assemblies - such as printed circuit boards for example - fitted with electronic, electromechanical and mechanical components or individual components are subjected, after being fitted with the components using a soldering method, to one or more test phases at high temperature and low temperature in order to be able to take any immediate correction measures which may be necessary if defects occur. For this purpose, the assemblies are soaked at a temperature in the range from 40 to 125 DEG C, using the solder temperature, in a first test phase and are soaked at a temperature in the range from -40 to 10 DEG C in a second test phase, the assemblies being subjected to a component test and/or functional test, in order to detect defective assemblies, in the respective test phase. Assemblies which are confirmed to be serviceable are subsequently passed to an output device, while defective assemblies are ejected from the route to the output device and a defect message is emitted. For improved defect monitoring, the assemblies can be provided with a digital coding, which can be read before the respective test phase, so that it is possible to control defective and serviceable assemblies by means of a digital computer.
