<CLAIMS>
Toolholder receptacle (8) with a toolholder (1) 
accommodated therein having a tool head (10) for a 

cutting tool, the toolholder (1) projecting into an 
opening in the said receptacle and being locked in terms 

of its movement in the axial direction by a coupling 
device, and also, for the purpose of avoiding rotary 

movement, having a guide part (2), on the underside of 
which is arranged a first guide (4) which runs in the 

axial direction and is in operative connection with a 
similar groove (6) in the toolholder receptacle (8), 

while on the side opposite to the first guide (4) the 
guide part (2) has a second guide (5), likewise running 

in the axial direction, the guide part (2) being arranged 
in the centre portion of the toolholder (1), and a chuck 

wedge (9), which is arranged in the toolholder receptacle 
(8) so as to be displaceable in the direction of the 

second guide (5), engaging on the second guide (5), 
characterized in that the second guide (5) is designed as 

a guide groove and the rear portion of the toolholder (1) 
is designed as a shank (3), on which a longitudinal 

detent (13) is arranged, the rear surface of which forms 
a vertical longitudinal seat (14), that cutting edge of 

the tool head (10) which is being used being arranged at 
a predetermined longitudinal distance (a) from the 

longitudinal seat (14), and a chuck jaw (15), which is 
arranged in the toolholder receptacle (8) so as to be 

vertically displaceable with respect to the longitudinal 
axis of the toolholder (1), which can be secured in 

position and which bears flush against the longitudinal  
 

seat (14), engaging in the longitudinal detent (13), the 
chuck jaw (15) in front of the chuck wedge (9) fixing the 

position of the toolholder (1) during the chucking 
operation. 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the guide part (2) of the 

toolholder (1) has a rectangular cross-section. 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the longitudinal detent (13) of the 

toolholder (1) is formed as a turned recess in the shank 
(3), the front side of which recess is conical and the 

rear side of which is formed by the vertical longitudinal 
seat (14). 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the toolholder receptacle (8) is a 

machining magazine (16), in which a plurality of 
toolholders (1) are combined with the associated chuck 

wedges (9) and chuck jaws (15), the machining magazine 
(16) being connected via a chucking location (17) to a 

machine head (18). 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the machining magazine (16) is used 

on a turret lathe or an NC automatic machine. 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claims 4 and 
5, characterized in that the lateral distance (b) between 

that cutting edge of the tool head (10) which is being 
used and the axis running in the longitudinal direction 

is constant along the shank centre of each toolholder 
(1). 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that the distance (c) between the axis 

of each toolholder (1) and a reference point (20) is 
constant. 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the toolholder receptacle (8) is a 

milling head (21), in which a plurality of toolholders 
(1) are combined with the associated chuck wedges (9) and 

chuck jaws (15). 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claim 8,  
 

characterized in that the toolholders (1) are combined in 
the milling head (21) in groups in a plurality of 

chucking locations which chuck independently of one 
another. 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claims 8 and 
9, characterized in that the toolholders (1) are chucked 

counter to the milling direction by the chuck wedges (9), 
the milling head (21) having holding devices (22) which 

support the tool head (10) from the rear side. 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that the tool head (10) of the 

toolholder (1) has a cutting tip (11). 
Toolholder receptacle according to Claims 1 to 
11, characterized in that the toolholder (1) can be 

chucked hydraulically or pneumatically via the chuck 
wedge (9) and the chuck jaws (15).
