<ABSTRACT>
A switched mode power converter includes a periodically switched 
power switch (103) which is switched under the control of a multiple loop feedback 

controlling the power switch in order to supply a regulated output (across 120). The 
output voltage and power switch current are sensed (on 113, and by 124 respectively). 

An error voltage is generated (by 115) which is representative of the deviation of the 
output voltage from a regulated value. A voltage (on 124) derived from the power 

switch current is limited in its low frequency response (by 131,135,132,133) and is 
then combined with the error voltage. The low frequency response of the current 

loop gain is used to maintain an advantageously low output impedance for the power 
supply. This shaped loop gain response advantageously allows accurate adjustment 

of the current loop gain and reduces the system to a lower order while maintaining 
adequate loop stability. The low frequency response may be attained by limiting the 

low frequency response of the sensed current or by inserting an operational amplifier 
(121) in the feedback path to limit its low frequency response.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to switch mode power converters. Multiloop feedback arrangements, including both current and voltage 
control, are used in switching mode power converters to improve many of its 
operating characteristics over those of similar power converters with single loop 
feedback control. Not all the changes in characteristics are improvements however. 
The closed loop output impedance of a switching mode power converter with a 
multiloop feedback control is normally greater than that of a converter with single 
loop feedback control. This increase in output impedance is due mainly to the 
presence of the current mode feedback loop. At low frequencies, below the resonant 
frequency of the output filter of the power converter the current loop adds further 
output impedance and in addition is not effective in significantly enhancing the 
closed loop performance of the converter. The low frequency output impedance of 
the converter is significantly increased below the output filter resonant frequency. In 
addition, at frequencies approaching one half the switching frequency, excessive 
current loop gain may introduce instability into the feedback loop. Since a voltage 
source (i.e. the voltage regulated switching mode power converter) should have a 
relatively low output impedance, it is desirable to reduce the high output impedance 
introduced by the current feedback loop. US-A-5 177 676 discloses a voltage source (an inverter) for providing 
AC/DC to AC output voltage conversion and including a current feedback loop 
which is applied to a voltage source amplifier. It is used in combination with voltage 
feedback to control the output impedance of the voltage generating means of the 
voltage source. According to this invention there is provided a switched mode DC to 
DC power converter as claimed in claim 1. A current feedback loop in a multiloop feedback arrangement has its 
frequency response shaped at low frequencies so that its loop gain is negligible 
below the output filter resonant frequency in order to reduce the output impedance of 
the power converter. In the Drawing:
