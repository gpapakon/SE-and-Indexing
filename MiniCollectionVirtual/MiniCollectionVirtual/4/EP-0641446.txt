<ABSTRACT>
In switching devices in which current contacts are made by actuating a magnetic armature, the test may include an analysis of vibrations or sound emitted in operating conditions. According to the invention, the sound emitted by the switching device when it is actuated is detected by a sensor and transmitted to an evaluation device for the discrimination of the time and/or frequency curve of individual sound components. It is possible in particular with the proposed process to discriminate between the sound signals produced by the making of the contacts and the armature. In addition, a sound analysis in the suitable time range permits a classification of any faults in the switching device. Finally, with particular reference to its application to flashing signal relays, it is possible to obtain an objective determination of the ''proper sound'' of the relay. In all cases it is especially the high sound components which are evaluated.

Testing process for the quality control of 
electromagnetically actuated switching devices, in which

individual sound components, characterized in that the 

sound signals caused on the one hand by the making of the 
contacts and on the other hand by the striking of the 

armature are detected and discriminated from each other

Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, for the digital evaluation after triggering the
