A switching controller system for converting an input 
voltage (U
E
) into an output voltage (U
A
) comprising a 
control amplifier (600) and pulse width modulator (500) in 

the control loop, and a power end stage (800) with storage 
choke (L) as controlled system, wherein the power end stage 

has a down converter (T801, D802, L) and an up converter 
(L, T803, D803) so that an input voltage range of U
E
 
<
 U
A
 
to U
E
 
>
 U
A
 can be corrected by the switching controller 
system, and the storage choke (L) is commonly used by the 

down converter (T801, D802, L) and the up converter (L, 
T803, D803), characterised in that the storage choke (L), 

which is common to the down converter and the up converter, 
has two end tappings and two central tappings, that in the 

closed state the switch of the down converter (T801) 
connects the input voltage (U
E
) via a first diode (D801) in 
the forwards direction to the input-side end tapping of the 

storage choke (L) and via a second diode (D802) in the 
reverse direction to the earth potential (GND), that in the 

closed state the switch of the up converter (T803) connects 
the output-side central tapping of the storage choke (L) to 

the earth potential (GND), that the output-side end tapping 
of the storage choke (L) is connected via a third diode 

(D803) to a filter capacitor (C) from which the output 
voltage (U
A
) is tapped, and that a further switch (T802) is 
provided which in the closed state connects the input-side 

central tapping of the storage choke (L) to the input 
voltage (U
E
). 
A switching controller system according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the switch of the down converter 

(T801) is actuated by the pulse-width-modulated control 
signal (PWM) of the pulse width modulator (500). 
A switching controller system according to Claim 1 or 
2, characterised in that the switch of the up converter  

 
(T803) and the further switch (T802) are actuated only when 

the input voltage is in the lower range. 
A switching controller system according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a voltage detector 

(101) is provided which generates a voltage detection 
signal (LVD) which indicates whether the input voltage (U
E
) 
is in the lower range. 
A switching controller system according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that a lo
gic stage (300) is provided which 
logic-links the voltage detection signal (LVD) to the 

pulse-width-modulated control signal (PWM) and to a clock 
signal to form a second control signal (VLV) which actuates 

the switch of the up converter (T803). 
A switching controller system according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the logic stage (300) also logic-links 

the voltage detection signal (LVD) to the pulse-width-modulated 
control signal (PWM) to form a third 

control signal (LVR) which actuates the further switch 
(T802). 
A switching controller system according to one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the switches of the 

down converter and of the up converter (T801, T803) and the 
further switch (T802) are switching transistors. 
A switching controller system according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the base electrodes of the respective 

switching transistors (T801 - T803) are supplied with the 
assigned control signal (PWM, LVR, VLV). 
A switching controller system according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the switching transistors (T801 - 

T803) are driven by clocked current sources (T805 - T807)  
 

which are themselves clocked by the respective control 
signals (PWM, LVR, VLV). 
A switching controller system according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that the clocked current sources each 

consist of a current source transistor in each case with a 
parallel circuit, arranged in the emitter arm, comprising a 

current-determining resistor and a capacitor, so that at 
the instant of switch-on the respective current source 

transistor is overmodulated and temporarily operates as 
amplifier.
