<ABSTRACT>
A dispersion of an enteric coating agent which can hold its 
uniform and stable dispersed condition over a long period of 

time without causing any aggregation even if it is exposed to 
any temperature change and which has high safety as a 

component for preparing pharmaceutical preparations is herein 
disclosed. The dispersion comprises an enteric coating base, 

a plasticizer and an anionic surfactant and is characterized 
in that the enteric coating base having an average particle 

size of not more than 10 µm is dispersed in water in a 
concentration ranging from 5 to 15% by weight on the basis of 

the total weight of the dispersion and that the ratio, the 
enteric coating agent: the plasticizer: the anionic surfactant 

is 100 parts by weight: 15 to 40 parts by weight: 0.1 to 
10 parts by weight. The enteric coating base is preferably 

either hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate or hydroxypropyl 
methyl cellulose acetate succinate and the plasticizer 

is preferably either triethyl citrate or triacetin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dispersion of a coating 
base which is applied onto the surface of a solid enteric 
pharmaceutical preparation. The solid enteric pharmaceutical preparation is provided with 
an enteric coating film for the purposes of protecting drugs 
showing low resistance to acids from the attack of the acid 
in the stomach, of protecting the gastric mucous membrane 
from the attack of drugs which may stimulate and damage the 
wall of the stomach and is dissolved after the arrival at the 
intestines in which the pharmaceutical preparation shows its 
pharmacological action. There have been used acrylic polymers and cellulosic polymers 
as enteric coating bases for such dispersion. The acrylic 
polymer may be, for instance, an emulsion polymer of 
methacrylic acid and ethyl acrylate. Examples of cellulosic 
polymers are cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), hydroxypropyl 
methyl cellulose phthalate (HPMCP), hydroxypropyl methyl 
cellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) and carboxymethyl ethyl 
cellulose (CMEC). These coating bases are used in the coating 
treatment of drugs in the form of a solution in an organic 
solvent or an aqueous latex or an aqueous dispersion. 
Recently, the use of organic solvents has been regulated due  
 
to the problem of environmental pollution and correspondingly, 
coating methods which make use of an aqueous system such 
as a latex or an aqueous dispersion have widely been adopted. There have already been proposed a variety of coating 
techniques which make use of aqueous systems, such as those 
described below. Japanese Patent Application Publication 
No. 60-43334 discloses an emulsion of an acrylic coating 
base. The acrylic coating base is an emulsion polymer of 
methacrylic acid and ethyl acrylate, has a particle size of 
not more than 1 µm and forms a stable emulsion. However, a 
polymerization initiator, a chain-transfer agent, unreacted 
monomers or the like are included in the enteric coating film 
as impurities and thus the coating film serving as a component 
of a medicine may suffer from a problem of safety. To disperse a cellulosic coating base in water, there have 
been known a method comprising adding salts along with the 
coating base or neutralizing the carboxyl groups of the 
coating base and a method comprising dispersing an enteric 
polymer in water in the form of fine particles. With regard to the former method, Japanese Patent Application 
Publication No. 61-56221 discloses a method which comprises 
the steps of emulsifying CAP, then
