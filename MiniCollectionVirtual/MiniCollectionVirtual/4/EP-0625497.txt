<ABSTRACT>
Bisphenols are prepared from cyclic 
monoterpene precursors and high glass transition 

temperature polymers are prepared from bisphenols. More

-1-methylethyl] 

phenol and 4,4'-[1-methyl-4-methylethyl)-1,3-cyclohexandiyl] 

bisphenol are 
isolated and high glass transition temperature bisphenol 

polycarbonates are prepared.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new compositions of 
matter, and more particularly to novel substantially pure 
bisphenols prepared from cyclic monoterpene precursors as 
well as high glass transition temperature polycarbonates 
comprising bisphenols. Further, a method is disclosed for 
isolating the above-mentioned substantially pure 
bisphenols. Polycarbonates are a well known class of high 
impact resistant thermoplastic resins characterized by 
optical clarity, high ductility as well as other advantageous 
properties. They are frequently employed as lenses and 
windows as a result of their transparency. Bisphenol A 
(BPA) polycarbonate is the predominant commercially 
available resin of this type. It is derived from 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane 
and ordinarily has a glass transition 
temperature of about 150°C. It is of increasing interest to prepare 
polycarbonates which, while retaining the ductility of BPA, 
have higher glass transition temperatures and are therefore 
more resistant to softening when heated. Polycarbonates possessing increased glass transition 
temperatures are very desirable, for instance, in the 
automotive and aircraft industries. Particularly, they may 
be used in the preparation of automotive headlamp lenses 
which are becoming smaller in size and characterized by  
 
closer proximity of the lenses to the heat-generating light 
source. The present invention is based on the discovery 
and method of isolation of substantially pure bisphenols; in 
particular, 4-[1-[3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methylcyclohexyl]-1-methylethyl]phenol 
(hereinafter 
referred to as BPT-1) and 4,4′-[1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-1,3-cyclohexandiyl]bisphenol 
(hereinafter 
referred to as BPT-2) and homologs thereof and 
homopolycarbonates and copolycarbonates prepared from 
bisphenols. Substantially pure is defined as at least about 
95% pure. The resulting homopolycarbonates possess 
increased glass transition temperatures on the order of 
about 198°C when employing BPT-1 and about 249°C when 
employing BPT-2. Moreover, copolycarbonates of BPT-1 and 
BPA as well as BPT-2 and BPA may be prepared which are 
also expected to display increased glass transition 
temperatures. Accordingly, attempts have been made to 
prepare polycarbonates that possess high glass transition 
temperatures in addition to clarity, high ductility and 
superior impact strengths. In commonly assigned, 
copending applications, Serial Nos. 07/989,309 and 
07/989,310, it is disclosed that polycarbonates prepared 
from
