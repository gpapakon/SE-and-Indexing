<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to alleviating congestion 
and reducing buffer requirements in a network which uses 
packet switching. Communication switching systems provide communication 
between sources and destinations in networks such as 
telephone networks and computer networks. One type of 
communication switching system is packet switching. In 
packet switching, a message from a source is split up into 
smaller pieces or packets. Routing information is added to 
each packet so that the packet can be delivered to its 
proper destination. The packets are output from a source to 
an intermediate packet switch, stored at that packet switch, 
then forwarded to subsequent intermediate packet switches, 
which also store and forward the packets, in the same 
manner, until the packets reach their destination. Packet switching systems are generally of two types: 
(1) datagram and (2) virtual circuit systems. In datagram 
packet switching systems all routing information is 
contained in the packet in an address header. The packet 
can be output on any communication line. Each packet can 
take a different path and therefore a sequence number is 
required so that when the packets reach their destination 
they can be put back together in the correct sequence to 
form the original message. Datagram packet switching has 
drawbacks in that the packets can get out of sequence. In a virtual circuit packet switching system, all 
packets are output over the same path for a certain period 
of time. The source and the destination agree on the path  
 
before packets are transmitted. After the path is agreed 
upon, routing information is setup in each intermediate 
packet switch which will be part of the path. The routing 
information in the intermediate packet switches is used in 
conjunction with an address header in the packets and with 
the input port or line that the packets come in on to route 
the packets. The drawback to current virtual circuit packet 
switching systems is that unlike datagrams, packets must use 
the same path for a certain period of time. This is true 
even if several communication lines are provided from one 
intermediate packet switch to another. Using the same path 
allows a packet switch to route packets to an output port 
based on the input port or line that the packet come in on. 
Because delay and or loss of packets may result when a large 
number of source-destination combinations use the same 
communication line, there is a need for the use of multiple 
communication lines. Packet
