<ABSTRACT>
A continuous manufacturing line for preparing gypsum fiberboard is provided. The manufacturing line includes equipment for admixing hydratable gypsum, paper, and a quantity of water to form a substantially homogeneous slurry, dewatering apparatus for removing a portion of the excess water from the slurry to produce a substantially continuous wet web, pressing equipment (36, 40, 44) for configuring the wet web with a compression means to form a substantially continuous green board, a cutting station (41) for cutting the substantially continuous green board into individual uncured lengths (57), and a heating station for curing the individual uncured lengths to form gypsum-dihydrate-containing fiberboards.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to equipment for the continuous
processing of gypsum-containing fiberboard, and more particularly, to wet
processing equipment for producing fiberboards of high strength at
minimum cost.Gypsum fiberboard is a construction material made from
admixing water, stucco and cellulosic fibers to form a wet mixture, and
permitting the stucco, also known as gypsum hemihydrate, to cure to form
a set gypsum dihydrate-containing board. Unlike paper-faced wallboard,
which is really a laminar construction including a weak gypsum core
disposed between two relatively heavy paper sheets, fiberboard is typically
unfaced. It is generally known that wallboard relies upon these paper
facings to provide as much as 90% of the requisite bending strength,
whereas fiberboard relies upon an intimate mixture of gypsum dihydrate
crystals and cellulosic fibers which adhere together to distribute applied
forces uniformly throughout the composite structure. This unique feature of
fiberboard has made it attractive in applications requiring a high degree of
mechanical strength, such as in fire door cores and edge banding.Early fiberboard manufacturing processes, such as the one
disclosed in Porter et al, U.S. Patent No. 2,076,349, taught the mixing of
calcined gypsum hemihydrate, paper fibers, and "excess water" (over and
above that required to fully hydrate the hemihydrate gypsum) together to
form a slurry. The slurry was placed into a mold and then subjected to a
pressure of up to about 6.9 MPa (1,000 psi) so that most of the excess
water could be squeezed from thq mixture. The resulting "green board", i.e.
not fully set, contained about 30-35 wt.% moisture which was later
removed by drying in a kiln oven. Fiberboards produced by this process 
were strong, having modulus of rupture values approaching as high as 12
MPa (1,750 lbs. per square inch), but low efficiency and the costs
associated with removing all that water made the boards too expensive.
Porter suggested a continuous operation for producing endless webs of
fiberboard, which could have helped to alleviate these costs, but his
disclosure failed to provide sufficient details for practising such an
operation.In some of the more modern processes, such as in the
method described in Take et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,645,548, sheet making
equipment has been employed to promote more continuous manufacturing
of fiberboard. Moreover, readily available and inexpensive forms of
gypsum dihydrate, such as flue gas desulfurization and phosphoric acid
dihydrate industrial

A gypsum board manufacturing plant, capable of alternatively
producing wallboards or fibreboards, which comprises:


(a) a wallboard manufacturing apparatus itself comprising
substrate introduction equipment (49) for providing a continuously moving

substrate (57), pin mixing means (51) for distributing a gypsum slurry onto
the substrate, and a moving carrier means (48) for permitting said gypsum

slurry to set, and
(b) a fibreboard manufacturing apparatus itself comprising:
admixing means (26) for mixing a hydratable gypsum, paper fibre, and

water to form a substantially homogeneous slurry (17);

dewatering means (28,29) for removing a portion of said
water from said slurry to produce a substantially continuous web (37);
pressing means (30,32,36,40,44) for configuring said wet web
with a compressive force to form a substantially continuous green board

said individual uncured lengths of fibreboard are permitted to at least
partially set on said moving carrier means; as well as
(c) an adjustment table (49) for displacing a portion of said

substrate introduction equipment so that, when in use for fibreboard
manufacture, there is uninterrupted passage of the setting, uncured,

fibreboards from said cutting means to the apparatus for drying said
fibreboards.
