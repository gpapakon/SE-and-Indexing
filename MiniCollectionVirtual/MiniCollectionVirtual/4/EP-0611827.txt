<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a substrate sensitive 
membrane having a thin metal film layer, specifically a 
substrate sensitive chitin membrane having a thin metal film 
layer, more specifically a substrate sensitive β-chitin 
membrane having a thin metal film layer, and to an enzyme 
electrode using the membrane. Enzyme sensor is a measuring device which is 
constructed in principle by equipping an electrode with an 
immobilized enzyme membrane, namely a substrate sensitive 
membrane, and its basic function is to detect a compound 
formed or digested by an enzyme reaction using an electro-chemical 
device and convert the detected data into electronic 
signals, thereby indirectly measuring a substrate specific 
for the enzyme. In this instance, the enzyme membrane 
functions as a molecular recognition site, and the 
electrochemical device functions as a transducer. Since the enzyme sensor makes use of excellent 
substrate specificity of an enzyme employed, it has excellent 
selectivity of substances to be measured. Various enzymes 
which are available have been applied to enzyme sensors for 
measuring the corresponding substrates.  Though the enzyme sensor has originally been 
developed with the aim of measuring a single substrate of 
interest, great concern has recently been directed toward the 
development of a multi-functional enzyme sensor which can 
measure a plurality of components simultaneously. Studies of the enzyme electrode, on the other hand, 
are now directed toward the prolongation of the shelf life 
and increase in the number of substances to be analyzed. 
While one of the characteristic advantages of the enzyme 
electrode is its economical cost for analysis, it has been 
desired to develop techniques for prolonging the shelf life 
and simplifying analytical operation. Since demands for the enzyme electrode seem to 
increase more and more in the future especially in the field 
of clinical inspections, such as emergency clinical test and 
bedside inspection, it is necessary to develop various types 
of electrodes. It has become more and more important to 
develop enzyme electrodes comprising a single support 
membrane having a plurality of enzymes immobilized thereon. In addition, enzyme membranes are most important for 
the development of an enzyme sensor, because properties of 
the enzyme sensor, such as the rate of response, sensitivity 
and stability, vary greatly depending on the characteristics 
of the enzyme membrane to be used. Especially, development 
of carriers for immobilization
