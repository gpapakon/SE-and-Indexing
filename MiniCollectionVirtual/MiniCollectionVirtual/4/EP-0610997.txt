<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a steam iron comprising a water reservoir, a 
steam chamber and a water-supply system for conveying water from the reservoir to the 

steam chamber. By using phosphonate compounds as a scale-growth inhibiting agent, in 
particular, obstruction of the water-supply system is overcome. It has been found that, 

in particular, poorly soluble phosphonate compounds are very suitable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a steam iron comprising a water reservoir, a 
steam chamber and a water-supply system for conveying water from the reservoir to the 
steam chamber, said iron comprising an agent for reducing the deposition of scale in the 
water-supply system. Such a steam iron is known per se from United States Patent Specification 
US 5,063,697. Said Specification more particularly describes a steam iron comprising a 
detachable cartridge which contains an ion exchanger. When the iron is in operation, 
the water reservoir is filled with tap water which, dependent on the quality of the local 
tap water, is hard or not so hard. This water is conveyed from the reservoir via the 
cartridge to the steam chamber. By means of the ion exchanger, the tap water is 
(partially) softened, so that the deposition of scale (predominantly calcium carbonate) 
during operation of the iron is substantially reduced at the location of the water-supply 
system and the steam chamber. In particular the deposition of scale in the water-supply 
system constitutes a major problem because it may cause the conduit of the water to be 
vaporized to become obstructed. Obstruction of the conduit renders the steam iron 
unserviceable. The drawback of the known steam iron is that the detachable cartridge 
containing the ion exchanger must be replaced by a "fresh" cartridge after it has been 
used for a number of hours. This is caused by the fact that the capacity of the 
customary ion exchangers to soften tap water is relatively small. Partly due to the 
limited volume of the water reservoir it is impossible, in practice, to provide the steam 
iron with a quantity of ion exchanger which is sufficient to soften the overall quantity of 
water used during the entire life of the device. Owing to this limitation, exchangeable 
cartridges containing ion exchanger are used at present. However, this solution to the 
problem of scale deposition in the iron is inconvenient. In addition, this solution causes 
constructional problems due to the exchangeability of the cartridge, which may be 
subject to leakage. It is an object of the invention to obviate the above drawbacks. The  
 
invention more particularly aims at providing a steam iron having a means for reducing 
the deposition of scale and hence for reducing obstruction of the water-supply system. 
Said means for reducing the deposition of scale is to be effective throughout the life of 
the iron. The invention further aims at solving the problem of scale deposition in the 
water-sup
