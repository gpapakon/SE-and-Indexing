<ABSTRACT>
A method for combining a first 
digital generated image and one or more prestored 

digital images. The method uses means for selecting 
one of the prestored digital images for and the steps 

of selecting an output format for printing the first 
digital generated image and the selected prestored 

image, providing the first digital generated image, 
combining the first digital generated image with the 

selected prestored digital image such that the 
generated image is placed in the predetermined location 

so as to form a merged image in accordance with the 
requirements of the selected output format, and for 

printing out the merged image in a desired format.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part application 
Serial No. 08/126,617, filed September 24, 1993. A method is disclosed for producing customized 
images by merging at least two images obtained from 
different sources and imprinting the merged image on at 
least one output format from a plurality of output forms 
that are available. This application is related to and 
continues subject matter disclosed in prior copending 
Buckley et al, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 
07/602,439, filed October 22, 1990, which was related to 
and continued prior copending Buckley et al, U.S. Patent 
Application Serial No. 07/282,013 which issued as 
US-A-5,036,472 on July 30, 1991, and Banks et al, U.S. 
Patent Application Serial No. 07/514,670, filed April 
25, 1990. This application is also related to and 
continues subject matter disclosed in prior copending 
Buckley et al, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 
07/876,389, filed April 30, 1992, which was a divisional 
application of prior copending Buckley et al, U.S. 
Patent Application Serial No. 07/735,985, filed July 25, 
1991, which was a division of prior U.S. Patent 
Application Serial No. 07/282,013 which issued as 
US-A-5,036,472 on July 30, 1991. The disclosures of said 
applications Serial Nos. 07/282,013, 07/514,670, 
07/602,439, 07/735,985 and 07/876,389 are incorporated 
herein by reference.  Applicants' related application 
07/282,013, now US-A-5,036,472, discloses 
examples of personalized greeting cards and the 
production of those cards. Designs have also been 
imprinted on various other articles such as hats, 
notebook covers, signs, bumper stickers, umbrellas, 
cloth, or canvas items, cups, coffee mugs, 
certificates, key chains, balloons, buttons, business 
cards, and other custom designed items. For instance, 
US-A-4,873,643 discloses the imprinting of 
designs by a customer using an apparatus which has a 
central processing unit (computer) programmed with 
design rules that restrict the placement and size of 
certain print design elements to assist the customer in 
providing the customized imprinted articles. In addition, EP-A-0 326 515 has addressed 
imprinting, or transferring of a complex image which 
has been obtained from the merging of a video/photo 
image into a decorative background and printing the 
complex image onto an ordinary blank card. A problem sometimes associated with previously 
available systems is that they have been limited either 
by the number of output formats, or in the type of 
input that may be provided, or in artifacts

<CLAIMS>
A method of combining a first digital generated image 
with one or more prestored digital images, comprising 

the steps of: 

a) selecting one of said prestored digital images, each 
of said prestored digital images having at least one 

predetermined location wherein said first digital 
generated image may be placed; 
b) said prestored digital images each being derived by 
combining a plurality of prestored individual design 

elements such that when combined together they will 
form said prestored digital image with said at least 

one predetermined location; 
c) providing said first digital generated image; 
d) combining said first digital generated image with 
said selected prestored digital image such that said 

generated images are placed in said predetermined 
location so as to form a merged image; and 
e) displaying, storing, transmitting, or printing said 
merged image. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein one of said 
plurality of individual design elements comprises a 

color. 
The method according to claim 2 wherein only a 
sufficient amount of computer memory is used to store 

the information necessary to create a single pixel fo 
said color. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein only a 
sufficient amount of computer memory is used to store 

information so as to create a single design element. 
The method according to claim 2 wherein one of said 
plurality of individual design elements comprises the 

form of a person, place, or object. 
A method of combining a first digital generated image 
with one or more prestored digital images, comprising 

the steps of: 

a) selecting one of said prestored digital images, each 
of said prestored digital images having at least one 

predetermined location wherein said first digital 
generated image may be placed; 
b) at least one of said prestored digital images being 
generated by taking a prestored design element and 

repeatedly modifying it, and combining the modified 
design elements; 
c) providing said first digital generated image; 
d) combining said first digital generated image with 
said selected prestored digital image such that said 

generated images are placed in said predetermined 
location so as to form a merged image; and 
e) displaying, storing, transmitting, or printing said 
merged image. 
The method according to claim 6 wherein one of said 
plurality of individual design elements comprises the 

form of a person, place, or thing. 
The method according to claim 6 wherein one of said 
plurality of individual design elements comprises a
