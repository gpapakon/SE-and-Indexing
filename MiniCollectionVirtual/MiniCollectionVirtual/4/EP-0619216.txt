<ABSTRACT>
A flooring material for use in the back of mini buses 
and vans, which is made up of a layer of elastomer, typically 

polyurethane (2), injection moulded onto a layer of plywood 
(4). The lower layer of plywood may be made of two adjacent 

pieces so that the whole floor material may be folded. The 
invention also includes a method of making this flooring 

material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flooring material 
which may be, but need not be, used in vehicles, for example 
road vehicles, and particularly in the rear of buses, mini 
buses, and vans. More particularly it relates to a 
composite, load bearing material and floor unit to be 
supplied by manufacturers with such vehicles. It also 
relates to a method of producing such a material. In many vehicles a surface is needed, above the basic 
metal of the floor shell, to make up the floor. The floor is 
usually required to be flat, strong with good load bearing 
capabilities, hard wearing and durable. Conventionally the 
floors in the rear of motor vehicles are made up from a 
number of hardboard boards fixed into set positions and 
covered over with rubber matting which may, or may not be 
glued to the under-layer of boards. Installing such a 
flooring system in a vehicle is usually labour intensive and 
time consuming, since it involves placing each of the boards 
individually and securing them by separate fittings to the 
underfloor of the vehicle, and then the further step of 
laying the rubber matting over the top, either in separate 
pieces or as a whole piece. Such a flooring system requires 
the storage of a number of different shapes of board for use 
in a single design of vehicle, and an even greater number if 
there are variations in the range provided by the 
manufacturer. This conventional system also suffers from the 
disadvantage that the rubber matting may not always lie flat 
against the boards, but may have ridges in it. This, if it 
is not solved immediately, may well be a nuisance, if only  
 
visually, further down a production line or once the vehicle 
is in use. It may well result in further time being taken 
over assembling the vehicle. A further disadvantage of using a number of boards is 
that unless they are fitted tightly they will rattle, or 
scrape against each other and cause added noise within the 
vehicle above any noise which may have passed through from 
underneath the vehicle or elsewhere. The hardboard also acts 
as an acoustic sounding board. Many of these problems are considered in document US 
1,776,510. This discloses a flooring made from sheathing 
floor members, e.g. wood, in vulcanisable rubber and pressing 
and treating the assembly in a mould. Although this document 
was filed in 1928, the other, "conventional system" is still 
what is used. The present invention is intended to overcome at least 
some of these problems associated with known systems. According to

comprising the step of providing a flexible elastomer 

material (2) on a first surface of one or more rigid 
substrate members (4); characterised in that said providing 

step comprises the step of injection moulding said elastomer 
material (2) directly onto said first surface. 
A method according to claim 1, further comprising 
the step of moulding support members (16) onto a second 

surface of said one or more substrate members (4). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
flooring material includes a plurality of adjacent substrate 

members (4), and further comprising the step of applying tape 
(20) to bridge adjoining edges of said substrate members, 

prior to said injection moulding step. 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, further 
comprising the step of shaping said flooring material and 

cutting holes through it, preferably by the use of a waterjet 
cutter. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims further comprising the step of pre-bending said one or 

more substrate members prior to the step of injection 
moulding. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims further comprising the step of integrally moulding a 

lip seal around a substantial part of the perimeter of the 
flooring material.  

 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein said one or more substrate members (4) 

comprise waterproof and boilable plywood. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the depth of said elastomer is varied across 

its width and/or its length. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein said elastomer is a polyurethane.

elastomer is a filled polyurethane material, and preferably 

filled with calcium carbonate and/or barium sulphate. 
A flooring material or method according to any 
one of the preceding claims wherein said elastomer is formed 

from mixing a polyol stream and/or an isocyanate stream.
