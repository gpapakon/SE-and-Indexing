<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel dioxacycloalkane 
compounds having renin-inhibitory activity, which are usable in 
the pharmaceutical field as a therapeutic agent for 
hypertension and the like. A renin-angiotensin system is one of the vasopressor 
systems in the body and an important blood pressure-humoral 
electrolyte adjusting system. Renin is a protease consisting of 
340 amino acids, which specifically cleaves angiotensinogen in 
plasma. It acts on angiotensinogen in plasma to cleave same 
into angiotensin I (AI) consisting of 10 amino acid residues. 
AI is further cleaved by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
into angiotensin II (AII) consisting of 8 amino acid residues. 
AII has a strong pressor activity and renin is a rate limiting 
enzyme for this system and important factor for blood pressure 
control. The physiological activity of AII includes, besides 
the above-mentioned pressor activity, stimulation of secretion 
of aldosterone, which is a kind of adrenocortical hormones, and 
AII promotes storage of Na⁺ and Cl⁻, and discharge of K⁺ 
and H⁺ in the body. Accordingly, a renin inhibitor is useful 
as a therapeutic agent for hypertension due to renin excess and 
a diagnostic for identification of patients with hypertension 
caused by renin excess, and various studies have been done in  
 
recent years. As to the peptide compounds having renin-inhibitory 
activity, there are WO90/07521, Japanese Patent 
Unexamined Publication Nos. 19071/1989, 221357/1989, 
204860/1991 and 503802/1992 and many other reports. It has been also reported that the compounds having renin-inhibitory 
activity are effective as therapeutic agents for 
HIV-infected diseases (Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication 
No. 47196/1991). However, the conventionally-known peptide derivatives 
having renin-inhibitory action cannot fully exert their 
pharmacological effects by oral administration. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel 
compound which has superior renin-inhibitory activity and can be 
administered orally. The present inventors have conducted intensive studies in 
an attempt to solve the aforementioned problems and found that 
the C terminal structure of the formula

R⁴ and R⁵are the same or different and each is a hydrogen 
atom or a lower alkyl; and  Eis -C(R²⁹)(R³⁰)- or -CH₂CH₂-
