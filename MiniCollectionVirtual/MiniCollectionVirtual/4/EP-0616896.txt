<ABSTRACT>
Main scanning is performed by reciprocating a 
recording head having a plurality of recording elements. 

After the main scanning is completed, sub-canning is 
performed by conveying the recording paper for a 

distance corresponding to the recording width of the 
recording head to record an image corresponding to 

received image data on the recording paper. At this 
time, the minimum transmission time for data is set in 

correspondence with the recording speed of the set 
recording mode. For example, a decision is made as to 

whether a one-direction recording mode or a 
bidirectional recording mode is set, and when the one-direction 

recording mode is set, the minimum 
transmission time for data is set to a time longer than 

that set in the bidirectional recording mode. This 
prevents overflow of memory f
or storing the received 
image data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image recording 
apparatus for recording an image corresponding to 
received image data on a recording medium by moving a 
recording head having a plurality of recording elements 
relative to the recording medium. In a previously known image recording apparatus of 
this type an ink jet recording head having a plurality 
of discharge openings and a corresponding plurality of 
recording elements, e.g., a plurality of heating elements 
is reciprocated in a primary scanning direction relative 
to a recording medium by a carriage, and, after the 
primary scanning is completed, the recording medium is 
conveyed in a sub-scanning direction substantially at 
right angles with the primary scanning direction in 
accordance with the recording width. Such a recording 
apparatus is sometimes designed so that the user can 
freely select one of a  
 
one-direction recording mode for recording during 
movement of the recording head in one of the 
reciprocation directions thereof, and a bidirectional 
recording mode for recording during movement of the 
recording head in both reciprocation directions thereof. 
A facsimile equipment using such a recording apparatus 
as a section for recording data transmitted through 
lines has also be proposed. In this apparatus, when noticeable deviation 
occurs in dots during printing of ruled lines by 
bidirectional recording, a user may select the 
one-direction recording mode in order to improve the 
quality of the recorded image. However, when one-direction 
recording is set, the ink jet recording head must be 
returned to the printing start position after one block 
is completely printed by one primary scanning. The 
printing time is thus 1.2 to 1.5 times that of 
bidirectional recording. Thus, even when the recording mode is set to either 
the one-direction recording mode or the bidirectional 
recording mode, if the minimum transmission time 
declared by a receiver is the same, more time is 
required for recording data in image memory for storing 
received data therein in the one-direction recording 
mode. There is thus the problem that, when a great  
 
deal of data is received, the image memory easily 
overflows. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided an image recording apparatus for 
recording an image corresponding to received image data 
on a recording medium by moving a recording head having 
a plurality of recording elements relative to said 
recording medium, said recording apparatus comprising:
