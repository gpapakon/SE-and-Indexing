<ABSTRACT>
A chip card is proposed having a microcomputer located on the chip card and a program and data connected to the said microcomputer, in which the data are stored compressed in the memory. In addition, the chip card contains a decoding table, so that the microprocessor is capable of decompressing the compressed data before reading out. By this means, significantly more information can be stored on the chip card in the same memory volume, without the connected device noting this. By means of a corresponding reading device it is possible to cause the cards to be read out in compressed or in decompressed form. Through this, the data throughput in chip card readers can be considerably increased, if large quantities of data are to be read out within a short time. Reading devices in chip cards are particularly advantageously applied in broadcast receivers in which data, for example RDS data, are transmitted as information additional to the broadcast programme.

<CLAIMS>
Smart card having a microcomputer (12) located
on the card and having a memory (11), connected to said

microcomputer, for programs and data and having an
input/output unit (14) which can be used to output

information to connection contacts (15) and to receive
information, the data being stored in the memory (11)

in compressed form, and the microcomputer (12)
decompressing the compressed data, characterized in

that a decoding table (13) is stored in the memory, in
that, after the smart card has been initialized, an

instruction is received via the input/output unit (14)
and is evaluated in the microcomputer, and in that the

data in the memory is sent to the input/output unit
(14) in decompressed or compressed form, depending on

the evaluation result.
Smart card according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the memory (11) stores data for decoding

traffic announcements transmitted in coded form.
Smart card according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the memory (11) 
stores
data for voice reproduction of digital information.
Reader for a smart card according to one of
Claims 1 to 3, having a computer (4), a program and

data memory (5) connected to the computer (4), an
input/output unit (7) which can be used to output

information to connections (8) and to receive
information, characterized in that, after the smart

card connected to the connections (8) has been 
initialized, a data word is transmitted from the reader

to the smart card, and in that, when a predetermined
data word occurs, the data on the smart card is

transmitted to the reader in compressed form, in that
the computer (4) has a decoding table (6), and in that

the computer uses the decoding table (6) in the
computer to decompress the compressed data which has

been received.
Use of a smart card according to one of Claims
1 to 3 for a radio receiver having a reception part (2)

and a decoder (3) for decoding digitally transmitted
supplementary information, in particular an RDS

decoder, having a card reader for reading the smart
card inserted into the radio receiver, characterized in

that the radio receiver reads in, from the smart card,
data for evaluating the digitally transmitted

supplementary information, and/or digitally encrypted
voice modules, in that the radio receiver transmits a

predetermined data word to the smart card, and in that,
depending on the predetermined data word, the data to

be read out is output in compressed form or the data in
the memory is decompressed.
