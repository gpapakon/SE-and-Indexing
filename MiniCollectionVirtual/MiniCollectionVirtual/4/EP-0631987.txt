<ABSTRACT>
A method for removing hazardous contaminants such as radon gas 
and volatile synthetic organic chemicals from domestic water 

supplies uses a perforated, horizontally-oriented tray which 
is baffled to define a curved (e.g., serpentine, spiral) 

liquid flow path. Contaminated water is distributed upon a 
portion of the tray and flows as directed by the baffles to a 

downcomer and into a storage tank. Air is blown into the 
storage tank, which is located below the perforated tray, and 

up through the perforations. The forced air causes the water 
flowing across the tray to froth, and evaporates the 

contaminants out of the frothing water. The forced air, 
carrying the volatilized contaminants, is then vented outside 

the home.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to removing hazardous contaminants
such as radioactive radon gas (radon-222) and volatile
synthetic organic chemicals (VOC's) from potable water
supplies, particularly for residential use, and a process,
apparatus and system therefor.Radon is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas produced
from the natural decay of uranium. In outdoor air, radon is
diluted and not recognized as a health hazard. However,
when radon gas is trapped indoors in air or water, in
sufficiently high concentrations, it can be dangerous.
Radon has been shown in several epidemiological studies to
be a very potent carcinogen that causes lung cancer in
humans. In the 1986 publication "A Citizen's Guide to
Radon", OPA-86-004, the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) stated that scientists have estimated
that about 5,000 to about 20,000 of the 130,000 lung cancer
deaths in the United States in 1986 may have been caused by
long term exposure to radon gas. This is considered to be
the second leading cause of lung cancer, after cigarette
smoking. Of these 5,000 to 20,000 deaths, about 500 to 1500
have been attributed to radon from residential potable
water supplies. The risk from water-borne radon is considered
to be higher than the combined risk from all of the
other manmade chemical contaminants in residential drinking
water.Since radon is an alpha emitter, the inhalation of radon
gas is considered to be a much greater problem than the
ingestion of water containing radon. If the radon is located
within the digestive tract, the easily shielded alpha
particles are likely to be absorbed by the fluids in the
digestive tract, where the energy is harmlessly dissipated. On the other hand, there is no shielding material within
the lungs to keep the alpha particles from impinging on the
delicate lung tissue, if the radon is inhaled.Uranium, and therefore radon, is frequently found in granite
bedrock deposits, which are common throughout the
United States and the world. It is estimated that there are
approximately 10 million private bedrock wells in the
United States, and that approximately 10% of them are
contaminated with radon in excess of 37 becquerel per liter
(Bq/l) (1000 pico-curies per liter (pc/l)). Radon typically
enters a home along with the water from a bedrock well.
Because radon is a volatile gas, it is given off by the
water during common household activities such as bathing,
showering, and washing dishes. Thus the radon given off by
the water becomes an inhalation hazard. It has been

A system for removing hazardous contaminants from
water comprising:


a tray (12, 126) having an intake portion (20, 134)
and an output portion (22, 136), the tray (12, 126) further

having a plurality of holes (14, 128) therethrough adapted
to distribute air along the flow path from the intake

portion (20, 134) to the output portion (22, 136),
walls defining a fluid flow path for frothing water
across the tray (12, 126), which flow path has a length

extending from the intake portion (20, 134) to the output
portion (22, 136) and being of substantially constant width

throughout the length thereof,
and means (82, 154) for providing air to the tray,
wherein the length of the flow path is significantly longer

than the width of the flow path.
A system according to claim 1 characterized in that
it comprises in combination: an aeration device, including

the perforated tray (12, 126) and an inlet (30) which is
adapted to distribute said contaminated water above said

aeration device, an accumulator tank (68) located below
said aeration device, whereby water which has flowed

through said aeration device may be accumulated, a blower

(82, 154) located below said aeration device, whereby air
may be forced upwardly through said aeration device, an

exhaust outlet (58) located above said aeration device and
in fluid communication with the atmosphere, whereby contaminated

air may be vented, inlet piping (32, 14)) adapted
to connect said inlet (30) with a source of contaminated

water, a solenoid valve (48, 142) in said inlet piping (32,
14), adapted to prevent or permit the flow of water through

said inlet piping (32, 140) and a water level switch (90)
having a high water level setting and a low water setting

located within said accumulator tank (68), said water level
switch (90) being electrically connected to both said

solenoid valve (48, 142), and said blower (82, 154), whereby
said solenoid valve (48, 142) is energized to permit 

water to flow through said inlet piping (32, 140) in response
to said water level switch (90) reaching its low

level setting, whereby said blower (82, 154) is energized
to force air through said accumulator device in response to

said water level switch (90) reaching its low level setting,
whereby said solenoid valve (48, 142) is de-energized

to prevent water from flowing through said inlet piping
(32) in response to said water level switch (90) reaching

its high level setting, and whereby said blower (82, 154)
is de-energized from forcing air through said accumulator

device in response to said water level switch (90) reaching
its high level setting.
The system according to claim 2 further comprising
timer means (86, 156) for keeping said blower (82, 154)

from de-energizing for a predetermined period of time after
said water level switch (90) has reached its high level

means (86, 156) comprises a timer electrically connected to
