<ABSTRACT>
A coin sorting and counting machine (1200) and a method for operating it
to automatically dispense cash vouchers based on the value of the counted coins,

manufacturer's coupons and store coupons. Coins are placed in a hopper tray
(1206) angled downwards from the horizontal. When the hinged tray is lifted, the

coins travel over a peak structure, through a waste management system (1304) and
into the coin sorting and counting apparatus (1202). The value of the coins and the

number of coins within each denomination are displayed as the coins are counted.
The coins fall into a storage area (1608) and the user is issued a cash voucher and a

series of manufacturer coupons.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/940,931, filed September
4,1992, and incorporated herein by reference.The present invention relates to coupon dispensing machines and coin sorting machines.There are a variety of machines which dispense stamps, tickets, coupons, money orders, bank
transactions or the like. One type of machine, shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,039,848 to Raymond Stoken,
dispenses coupons in exchange for money. A display area indicates the different coupons available as
well as the specific amount of money required to obtain each particular coupon. Money is inserted into
the machine via a coin slot. Control circuitry determines which coupon has been selected, the amount
of money required to purchase this coupon, and if the correct amount of money has been inserted into
the coin slot. The control circuitry then causes the coupon dispenser to dispense the requested coupon.Other machines dispense other types of products. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,021,967 to
Lawrence Smith is a money order dispensing machine. This machine is meant to be operated by a
system operator, not a customer, and therefore does not require the capability to receive money. The
machine prints money orders on a dot matrix printer after receiving the necessary data inputs from the
operator.Such previous devices are deficient from the point of view of a consumer with an arbitrary
amount of coins, since they require the input of an exact coin value. Further, the device requires a
mechanism for determining if the required amount has been deposited and for taking an appropriate
action depending on whether the required amount is deposited.A different variety of machines has been patented which sort coins. One such machine, shown in
U.S. Pat. No. 4,995,848 to David Goh uses two methods to sort coins, both methods based on the
diameter of the coins. In this machine the coins are loaded into a hopper. A rotating wheel feeds the
coins individually onto an inclined ramp. The coins roll down the ramp with their rear surfaces resting
against a support surface. Specific denominations are selected when they fall through slots of varying
site located in the support surface. Specific denominations are also selected using peeler knives which
are arranged at different distances from the ramp surface. These knives topple the coins from the ramp
into bins. Using both techniques allows a short ramp to be employed. Another type of machine shown
in U.S. Pat. No. 4,059,122 to Yoshio Kinoshita counts the number of

<CLAIMS>
A coin disposal system including:

means (120) for receiving a plurality of coins of arbitrary denomination
from a user;
coin sorting and counting means (1306) operable to determine the total
value of received coins;
voucher issuing means (1310) operable to output a voucher for an amount
related to the total counted value; characterised by clearing means operable

automatically on detection of a coin jam in the system.
A coin disposal system according to claim 1, wherein said clearing means
includes means (1432) for suspending flow of coins into the sorting and counting

means.
A coin disposal system according to claim 2, wherein said flow suspending
means (1432) can be disabled to provide for a sudden flow of coins after a

suspension of flow.
A coin disposal system according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the flow
suspending means includes a gate (1432) located between the receiving means

(120) and the coin sorting and counting means (1306).
A coin disposal system according to claim 4, wherein the gate (1432) when
in an open position prevents the passage of a flow of coins greater than a

predetermined thickness.
A coin disposal system according to claim 5, wherein the predetermined
thickness is a single layer or plane of coins.
A coin disposal system according to any preceding claim, including means
for providing a problem report relating to a jam.
A coin disposal system according to any preceding claim, including means
for outputting instructions for clearing a jam.
