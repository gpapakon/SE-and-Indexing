<ABSTRACT>
A connector device (10) for forming an angled interconnection of two tubes has a first member (11) provided with a part spherical recess (30) and a second member (12) having a hollow head portion (40) the outer surface (41) of which is part spherical to conform to and seat against the recess (30) in the first member. The confronting surfaces (30, 41) are held together by a retainer (48) which extends through the hollow head portion (40) of the second member and locates with the first member. The retainer (48) extends through a slot (46) in the hollow head and that slot extends radially outwards from the center (47) of the part spherical outer surface so that by adjusting the position at which the retainer (48) extends through the slot (46) the angular interconnection of the two members (11, 12) may be varied selectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a handrail assembly which is 
adjustable for interconnection of two handrail components, 
such as two tubes, to lie in any of a range of positions 
relative to one another. Examples of known handrail connector devices are 
described in DE-U-8832774 and BE-A-883102. Connector devices for securing a tubular member to 
another tubular member or for example to support structure 
are used commonly in the construction of handrails and 
balustrades. The connector devices usually are required to 
provide a smooth surface in combination with the end of a 
tube to which they are connected and to interconnect with 
that tube in a tamper resistant manner. A difficulty 
arises in that a considerable number of such connectors are 
needed, and are required to be held in stock, in order to 
interconnect different size tubes and allow interconnection 
of the tubes at any of a range of relative positions. 
Articulated type connection devices have been proposed but 
these generally suffer the disadvantage of being 
incompatible with providing a smooth and tamper resistant 
interconnection. The present invention seeks to provide an improved 
handrail assembly which lends itself readily to provision 
of an interconnection between a handrail and a support post 
whereby said handrail and support post can lie in a 
position relative to one another selected from any of a 
range of relative positions. In accordance with one of its aspects the present 
invention provides a handrail assembly comprising a 
substantially continuous length of handrail and a connector 
device which enables a support post to be secured in a 
selected orientation relative to the length of the 
handrail, the connector device comprising a first member 
which is an insert located in part of said continuous 
length of handrail, a second member adjustably associated 
with the first member by means of a retention assembly, the  
 
first member having formed in an external surface thereof 
a recess of part spherical shape, the second member 
comprising a substantially elongate body having a hollow 
head portion and a substantially tubular tail portion, said 
portions being substantially aligned with one another along 
the longitudinal axis of the body, the head portion of the 
second member comprising a part spherical outer surface 
which conforms substantially with the shape of the recess 
in the first member, said head portion being shaped to 
provide a slot, the retention assembly being arranged to 
extend at least in part through

<CLAIMS>
A handrail assembly comprising a substantially 
continuous length of handrail (70) and a connector device 

(12,72) which enables a support post to be secured in a 
selected orientation relative to the length of the 

handrail, characterised in that the connector device 
comprises a first member (72) which is an insert located in 

part of said continuous length of handrail (70), a second 
member (12) adjustably associated with the first member by 

means of a retention assembly (48), the first member having 
formed in an external surface thereof a recess (30') of 

part spherical shape, the second member (12) comprising a 
substantially elongate body having a hollow head portion 

(40) and a substantially tubular tail portion (43), said 
portions being substantially aligned with one another along 

the longitudinal axis of the body, the head portion (40) of 
the second member comprising a part spherical outer surface 

(41) which conforms substantially with the shape of the 
recess (30') in the first member, said head portion being 

shaped to provide a slot (46), the retention assembly (48) 
being arranged to extend at least in part through said slot 

(46) and be adjustable such that the first and second 
members may be either restrained against said relative 

movement or be substantially free for relative pivotal 
movement upon relative sliding movement of said confronting 

part spherical surfaces (30',41). 
A handrail assembly according to claim 1 characterised 
in that said slot (46) extends through at least 30° 

relative to the longitudinal axis (47) of the second 
member. 
A handrail assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that said slot (46) extends substantially 

only to one side of the longitudinal axis (47) of the 
second member. 
A handrail assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the part spherical 

recess (30'), as considered in cross-section, subtends an 
angle of at least 80° about its centre of curvature.  

 
A handrail assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the hollow head 

portion (40) of the second member has a part spherical 
internal surface (42) which is dimensioned such that the 

wall thickness of the head portion, at least in the 
vicinity of the slot (46), is substantially uniform. 
A handrail assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the tail portion 

(43) of the second member is adapted for location in and to 
abut the end of a support post (63), the axial length of 

the tail portion (43) preferably being less than twice the 
axial length of the head portion (40). 
A handrail assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that a washer (35) of 

resilient material is provided in a base region of the 
recess (30) whereby it may provide resistance to relative 

movement of said first and second members. 
A handrail assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the handrail (70) 

comprises a longitudinally extending groove (71) in which 
the first member (72) is slidable. 
A handrail assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that said first member 

(72) of the connector device has an outer surface region 
which is part cylindrical. 
A handrail assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that it includes a 

support post (63) secured to the second member (12), the 
handrail (70) and support post (63) each being of a kind 

having a longitudinal or major axis and the connector 
device being orientated such that said axes are offset. 
A handrail assembly according to claim 10 
characterised in that the handrail (70) comprises a curved 

portion and is secured to a corner post (63) at a position 
where the handrail is curved as viewed vertically in plan, 

the connector device being orientated such that the 
longitudinal axis of the post (63) is offset locally 

relative to the major axis of the handrail.
