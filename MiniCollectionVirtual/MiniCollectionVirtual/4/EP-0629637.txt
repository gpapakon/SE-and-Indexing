<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing liquid starch
having a solids content of 15% or more (high solids liquid starch) using a modified two step batch cooking procedure.The ability to provide high solids liquid starch products which are stable
and readily useful is highly desired for various end uses. Such starch products
have been available and produced for many years in continuous cooking processes
using a heat exchanger or jet cooker. Illustrative processes and equipment used
therein are described in US-A-2,919,214;
US-A-3,133,836; US-A-5,131,953
and in Chapter XVIII of Starch:Chemistry and
Technology, edited by Roy Whistler et al., 1984, pp. 555-557.While the continuous cooking processes as described above, do provide high
solids starch products, they involve the use of high pressure steam and specially
modified jet cooking equipment and conditions which may not always be available.
Furthermore, in some situations it may not be economically feasible to build and
install the needed equipment. In such circumstances, standard batch operations
may be employed, however, they usually require special mixing equipment such as
"gate" or "racker arm" type agitators in order to provide high solids starches.
When using standard batch cooking processes with other common or conventional
mixers, the desired levels of high solids content, i.e. 15% or more, cannot be
attained because the cooked starches have such high final viscosities and peak
viscosities during cooking that they are not easily mixable, pumpable, or
handleable. This is especially true in batch tanks containing turbine type
agitators which can be easily "overloaded" by the extremely high peak viscosity
during the cooking process. In this instance the drive motor might "burn out"
or the agitator could either "bend" or "bore a hole" in the starch gel produced.Accordingly, there is need for a process of providing stable,
liquid starch products having a solids content of 15 % or more wherein the use of special and costly equipment such as
involved in continuous cooking operations are not required.Now it has been found that liquid starch products having a high solids
content of 15 % or more and suitable viscosity for easy mixing during the cooking process plus 
easy handleability and pumpability in final applications are provided via a
modified two step batch cooking operation.More particularly, this invention involves a method of preparing a
predispersed liquid starch having a solids content of 15 % or more in a batch process comprising:

<CLAIMS>
A method of preparing a predispersed liquid starch having a solids content of 15% or more in
a batch process comprising:


a) heating an aqueous slurry of a waxy starch having a solids
content of 0 to 25% by weight and maintained at a pH of at least 4.0

to a temperature in the range of 26.6 to 98.9°C (80 to 210°F), and
b) slowly adding an aqueous slurry of waxy starch having a solids
content of 30 to 50% while maintaining a temperature at least as high as

the gelatinization temperature of the starch.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the temperature is maintained at 82.2°C (180°F)
or higher during the slow addition of the higher solids starch.
The method of Claim 2 wherein the waxy starch has a water fluidity
(WF) of 20 to 85.
The method of Claim 3 wherein the waxy starch contains a tertiary
amine or quaternary ammonium ether cationic group.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the first aqueous slurry has a solids
content of 0 to 15% by weight and the slow added high solids slurry has a

solids content of 35 to 45%.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the waxy starch has a water fluidity
(WF) of 30 to 40 and the temperature is maintained at 82.2°C (180°F) or higher

during the slow addition of the higher solids starch.
The method of Claim 6 wherein the waxy starch contains a tertiary
amine or quaternary ammonium ether cationic group, the first aqueous slurry has

a solids content of 0 to 15% by weight and the slow added high solids
slurry has a solids content of 35 to 45%. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the first aqueous slurry has a pH of
7 or more.
The method of Claim 8 wherein the temperature is maintained at 26.6°C
(80°F) or higher during the slow addition of the higher solids starch and the waxy

starch has a water fluidity (WF) of 20 to 85.
The method of Claim 9 wherein the first aqueous slurry has a solids
content of 0 to 15% by weight and the slow added high solids slurry has a

solids content of 35 to 45%.
