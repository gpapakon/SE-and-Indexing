<ABSTRACT>
A suspended microstructure fabrication process. Photoresist pedestals (38a) are inserted in a sacrificial layer (30) between the suspended microstructure (20) and the substrate (14) and photoresist spacers (38) are inserted in the microstructure layer between non-contacting portions of the suspended microstructure so that the photoresist pedestals and spacers support the microstructure bridge during the wet etching and drying process used to remove the sacrificial layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a method for 
fabricating integrated circuits having suspended 
microstructures. More particularly, the invention 
pertains to a method and structure for preventing 
parts of the microstructure from sticking to the 
substrate or other parts of the microstructure during 
fabrication. U.S. Patent Application No. 07/569,080 filed on 
August 17, 1990 (corresponding to WO-A- 92/03740) and entitled Monolithic Accelerometer 
discloses an integrated circuit comprising a 
suspended microstructure acceleration sensor and 
conditioning and resolving circuitry on the same 
chip. The device disclosed therein can be fabricated 
by the process generally outlined therein but is more 
preferably fabricated using the improved process 
disclosed herein. The sensor 
portion of the accelerometer disclosed in that 
application comprises a polysilicon bridge suspended 
above a substrate by a series of posts. The 
polysilicon bridge comprises a suspended longitudinal 
beam having a plurality of fingers extending 
transversely therefrom. For each finger extending 
from the beam, there is a corresponding stationary 
finger positioned parallel and close thereto. The 
bridge is electrically conductive and is charged to a 
different voltage than the stationary fingers. The  
 
polysilicon bridge is resilient such that, under 
accelerative force, the bridge, including the 
fingers, will move relative to the corresponding 
stationary fingers. The capacitance between the 
movable fingers and the stationary fingers is 
observed and resolved to determine the magnitude of 
the accelerative force to which the sensor is 
subjected. Other suspended microstructures for sensing 
acceleration and other phenomena are disclosed in 
U.S. Patents Nos. 4,711,128; 5,025,346 and 5,054,320. The fabrication of wafers embodying suspended 
microstructures is difficult and usually produces a 
relatively low yield of acceptable chips. A 
particularly troublesome problem during fabrication 
is contact and sticking of the microstructure to the 
substrate. Also, surfaces of the suspended 
microstructure frequently stick to other surfaces of 
the suspended microstructure or to other surfaces on 
the chip during processing. It is extremely 
difficult to separate the polysilicon microstructure 
from the substrate, another polysilicon 
microstructure , or other components of the chip once 
it has come in contact therewith. Liquid surface tension effects are among the most 
significant causes of the microstructure coming in 
contact with

<CLAIMS>
A method of fabricating a suspended 
microstructure (12) comprising the steps of; 


depositing a layer of sacrificial material (30) on 
a substrate (14), 
selectively removing portions of said sacrificial 
material (30) so as to create holes in said sacrificial 

layer for formation of posts (16) for said 
microstructure, 
depositing a second material (31) over said 
substrate and said sacrificial layer, said microstructure 

(12) to be formed of said second material, said second 
material (31) filling in said holes in said sacrificial 

layer and forming a second layer over said sacrificial 
layer, and 
selectively removing portions of said second layer 
to form gaps (32) in said second layer and to pattern 

said second layer into a shape (18, 20) comprising said 
suspended microstructure, whereby portions of said 

sacrificial layer are exposed beneath said second layer; 
 
   characterised by: 


selectively removing sections of said exposed 
portions of said sacrificial layer as well as sections of 

said sacrificial layer adjacent to said exposed portions 
which are beneath said microstructure so as to form gaps 

(36) in said sacrificial layer, 
depositing a photoresistive material (38) over said 
substrate, sacrificial layer and second layer, said 

photoresistive material filling in said gaps (36, 32) in 
said sacrificial layer and said second layer, 
selectively removing portions of said photoresistive 
material (38) from said gaps in said sacrificial layer 

and said second layer such that some (38a) of said 
photoresistive material remains beneath said 

microstructure forming pedestals between said substrate 
and said second layer, 
removing any remaining portions of said sacrificial  
 

layer, and 
removing any remaining portions (38a) of said 
photoresistive material. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
sacrificial layer (30) comprises an oxide film, and said 

step of removing any remaining portion of said 
sacrificial layer comprises wet etching. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
second material (31) comprises a polysilicon film. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said 
step of removing any remaining portions (38a) of said 

photoresistive material comprises exposing said material 
to an oxygen plasma. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
said step of selectively removing portions of said 

sacrificial layer (30) comprises etching said sacrificial 
material. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
said step of selectively removing portions of said second 

layer comprises etching said second material (31). 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
said step of selectively removing said photoresistive 

material (38) is performed such that said photoresistive 
material remaining after said selective removal forms 

spacers (38c) between adjacent portions (20) of said 
microstructure.
