<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for regenerating and preserving skins or leathers, specially bindings, and which consists 
in applying to the skin, during a first step, a nutritive cream comprised of saponified greasse, excipient, distilled glycerin, liquid 

paraffin, cod-fish liver oil, mink oil, castor oil, wool fat, collagen, elastin, sodium tetraborate and essence of bitter almonds in 
preestablished proportions. In a second step, an agglutinating-hydrating solution is sprayed on the leather or skin, said solution 

being comprised, by excipient, of trisodium phosphate, biodistilled glycerin, polyethyleneglycol 400, collagen, elastin, sodium tetraborate 
in solution and essence of bitter almonds, and in the third step, a protection cream is applied, said cream being comprised 

of native wax, wool fat, liquid paraffin, biodistilled glycerin, sodium tetraborate and essence of bitter almonds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers, as previously stated in the
title, to a treatment designed to regenerate and preserve
leather, with the intention of returning their genuine
characteristics to very deteriorated leather and parchment.A special application of the invention is directed to
obtain these results with binding leather, which deteriorates
progressively with age to the point where it becomes nearly
destroyed.The application of this method is very easy to use, and
implies great advantage in libraries, files, and the like, where
large number of bound volumes are held. This permits them to be
kept in the original binding without having to replace or repair
them, which could result in a loss of their historic value as an
antique.The method applicable to this invention is the result
of many years of research, after testing on over eighty
ethnografic pieces and many other old leather-bound books.The composition and methodologie used represent
innovative state of the art techniques. Contacts have been
established with national and foreing institution dedicated to
the restoring and preserving of these type of materials and they
have stated that there is no product in the market similar to
the invention, nor one which obtains such positive results.In summary, the method consists in the use of three
different compositions, which are comprised of different
components and are applied in a specific order and through a
conveniently designed methodology.Given the nature of the material to be treated and
considering the great variety available (different types and
characteristics, tanning processes, tanning materials, and types
of degradation) the components of this process may be varied
depending on the pieces to be treated.Thus, the proportion of
these components should be used within an ample range of 
proportions so as to permit their application to specific cases.
The desciption given refers, in any case, to citeria for a
standard use.The method for the regenerating and preserving of
leather, comprises the following phases:
a) Applying a nutritive cream to the leather to be
treated and spreading over the entire surface. This nutritive
cream is made from saponified grease (75 to 150 ml.); excipient
(150 to 300 ml.); distilled glycerin (50 to 100 ml.); liquid
paraffin (25 to 50 ml.); cod-fish liver oil (15 to 50 ml.); mink
oil (15 to 50 ml.); castor oil (15 to 50 ml.); wool fat (25 to
50 ml.); collagen (solution) (40 to 75 ml.); elastin (solution)
(40 to 75 ml.);sodium tetraborate (5 to 10 gr.), essence of
bitter

METHOD FOR THE REGENERATIVE AND PRESERVATIVE
TREATMENT OF LEATHER, SPECIALLY BINDINGS, it consists on a first

stage to extend on the leather to be treated, a cream comprising
75 to 150 ml. of saponified grease; 150 to 300 ml. of excipient;

50 to 100 ml. of biodistilled glycerin; 25 to 50 ml. of liquid
paraffin; 15 to 50 ml. of cod-fish liver oil; 15 to 50 ml. of

mink oil; 15 to 50 ml. of castor oil; 25 to 50 gr. of wool fat;
40 to 75 ml. of collagen (solution); 40 to 70 ml. of elastin

(solution); 5 to 10 gr. of sodium tetraborate and 10 to 15 ml.
of esence of bitter almonds, this cream is prepared to the bain-marie,

stirring constantely to obtain an homogeneous mixture,
with a pH between 8 and 9. This cream is applied to the leather

after being cooled down and it will be kept extended on the
leather during a time depending on the state of deterioration of

the leather. After its action on the leather the cream will be
removed with cotton.
METHOD TO THE REGENERATIVE AND PRESERVATIVE
TREATMENT OF LEATHERS,SPECIALLY BINDINGS, according with the

first claim, on a second stage the leather is subjected to the
action of an agglutinating-hydrating solution, comprising 250 to

400 ml. of excipient with trisodium phosphate; 75 to 150 ml. of
biodistilled glycerin; 25 to 75 ml. of polyethyleneglycol 400;

20 to 50 ml. of collagen (solution) 20 to 50 ml. of elastin
(solution); 3 to 6 gr. of sodium tetraborate (solution) and 5 to

10 ml. of essence of bitter almonds, this solution is prepared
at cool temperature, stirring constantly all the components to

obtain an homogeneous mixture. 
METHOD FOR THE REGENERATIVE AND PRESERVATIVE
TREATMENT OF LEATHER, SPECIALLY BINDINGS, according with the

first and second claims, the third stage which begins after the
solution has been absorved by the leather, it consists in

spreading by rubbing with a chamois or similar, a protective
cream, comprising 100 to 150 gr. of native wax; 100 to 200 gr.

of wool fat; 75 to 150 ml. of biodistilled glycerin and 5 to 10
gr. of sodium tetraborate (solution) and 5 to 10 ml. of esence

of bitter almonds.
