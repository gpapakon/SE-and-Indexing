<ABSTRACT>
The spectacles hinge comprises a first knuckle (1) integral with the face part (2) of the spectacles frame and a second knuckle (3) connected via a spring device to the side (4) of the spectacles, the said device (5) comprises a casing (10) integral with the side (4) including a longitudinal housing (11). The second knuckle (3) is integral with a prolongation (12) mounted so as to slide in the housing (11). A coil spring (16) surrounds a screw (15) of the prolongation (12) and includes one turn (19) of a diameter greater than that of the other turns and intended to engage in a groove (20) in the wall of the housing (11). The spring (16) bears, on the one hand, on this turn (19) locked in the wall of the housing (11) and, on the other hand, on the head (17) of the screw (15) in order to urge the prolongation (12) in the direction of the bottom of the housing (11) and to urge a bearing surface (26) of the casing (10) against a cam (25) integral with the first knuckle (1), thus determining open and folded-up positions of the side (4). Because of the particular shape of the end of the spring (16) interacting with the groove (20) in the housing, particularly simple construction, rapid and easy fitting and reliable operation of the spring hinge are achieved.

A hinge with a spring for the frame of spectacles, including two 
knuckles (1, 3), of which one (1) is intended for fastening to the 

front part (2) of the frame and the other one (3) is intended for 
connection to a branch (4), and a spring device (5) for connecting said 

other knuckle (3) to the branch (4), this device including a housing 
(11) extending longitudinally with respect to the branch (4), an extension 

(12) integral with said other knuckle (3) and designed for being 
mounted slidably in the housing (11) and a coil spring (16) disposed 

along this extension, this spring (16) abutting, on the one hand, by a 
first end, against a part of said extension (12) and, on the other 

hand, by its second end, against the walls of the housing (11), so as 
to bias the extension (12) in the direction of the bottom of the housing 

(11), characterized in that said second end of the coil spring 
(16) exhibits a portion (18) consisting of at least one coil, which is 

deformed or compressed or has a diameter greater than that of the other 
coils of the spring, extending at least partly beyond the outer surface 

of the coil spring (16), this portion (18) being designed for cooperating 
with a step (20) provided on the inner wall of the housing (11) so 

that this step (20) acts as a support stop for said portion (18) of the 
spring (16). 
A hinge according to claim 1, characterized in that said portion 
(18) of the spring is formed with at least one coil (19) having a diameter 

greater than that of other coils of the coil spring (16), the inner 
wall of the housing (11) exhibiting a circular groove (20) into 

which said portion (18) of the spring is engaged.  
 
A hinge according to claim 1, characterized in that said portion of 
the spring is comprised of at least one coil (133) of the spring (132) 

shifted sideways with respect to the other coils of the coil spring 
(132) and designed for engagement in a hollow (136) provided in the inner 

wall of the housing (111). 
A hinge according to claim 3, characterized in that the wall of the 
housing (11) has a hole (138) made in such a manner as to enable to disengage 

by means of a tool, said portion (133) of the spring (132) from 
the hollow (136) to extract the extension (112) from the housing (111). 
A hinge according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the extension (12) is comprised of a rod (15) integral with said other 

knuckle (3), the coil spring (16) being arranged on this rod (15) which 
has an end (17) of a straight section greater than the rod (15) against 

which the spring (16) abuts by its first end, the second end abutting 
by said portion (18) against the step (20) of the inner wall of the 

housing (11). 
A hinge according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the extension (112) incudes a hollow (131) in which is housed, at least 

partly, the coil spring (132), with its first end abutting against the 
bottom of the hollow (131).
