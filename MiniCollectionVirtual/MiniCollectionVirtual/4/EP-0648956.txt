<ABSTRACT>
A divided flywheel device has a first flywheel (3), connected to the crankshaft (1) of an internal combustion engine, provided with an axial bearing arrangement (19, 20) for a hub (10) and formed in the circumferential area with a radial bearing (16) for the hub (10), as well as a second flywheel (12), rotatable in synchronism with the hub (10) and capable of limited rotation relative to the first flywheel (3). In this flywheel device, the axial bearing (19, 20) is to be arranged in such a way that sufficient supply of the same with lubricant is always ensured on the one hand and optimum axial guidance of the hub (10) can be achieved on the other hand. To achieve this object, the axial bearing (19, 20) is provided with travel limits for the hub (10). The travel limits extend on both sides of the hub (10) up to the radial bearing (16).
