<ABSTRACT>
An automatic screw-feeding device including a 
sliding box (3) and a sprocket (34) to move a screw belt 

(N1) through the sliding box (3), the sprocket (34) 
being locked at one of various positions to keep a screw 

(N) on the screw belt (N1) at a secured position for a 
driver (27) rotated by an electric motor to fix in 

something, the sprocket (34) being rotated by a shaft 
(36) rotated by pulling the sliding box (3) forward and 

backward forcing an orienting rod (17) to move along in 
a non-straight groove (361) in the shaft (36) fixed 

through a side wall of the sliding box (3) contained in 
a housing (1) so that the shaft (36) is rotated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a screw feeding device 
for advancing belt-mounted screws into a predetermined 
position for being driven by a driving means. There are automatic screw driving tools such as are 
shown in U.S. Patents No. 4,059,034, 3,930,297 and 
4,059,034, which include a sprocket member to move a 
screw belt and a pawl and a pin to prevent the sprocket 
member from rotating reversely. But the stopping 
function of the pawl and the pin is not good in these 
known devices, and in addition, a slide member has a 
cylindrical recess which is unadjustable so that each 
screw-driving device is only suitable for one size of 
screws. So a user has to prepare a plurality of screw-driving 
devices for 13-51mm screws. Another drawback is 
that the sprocket member does not work accurately to 
move a screw belt because of difficulties in locking the 
sprocket member firmly. The arrangements shown in U.S. Patents Nos. 
3,930,297 and 3,910,324 can only fix screws in a 
horizontal direction, and are limited in practical 
function. Viewed from one aspect, the present invention 
provides a screw feeding device for advancing belt-mounted 
screws into a predetermined position for being 
driven by a driving means, which feeding device 
comprises a housing and a sliding member in sliding 
engagement with said housing, the sliding member having 
a passageway for receiving a belt carrying said screws, 
an opening connecting said passageway with the exterior 
and sprocket means mounted on a shaft within said 
sliding member for advancing said belt-mounted screws 
into a predetermined position adjacent said opening for 
being driven therethrough, wherein said housing has 
means adapted to engage with and to rotate said shaft as  
 
said sliding member is moved relative to said housing, 
locating means are provided resisting rotation of said 
sprocket means relative to said sliding member, and said 
spocket means is mounted on said shaft through a one-way 
bearing, said locating means and said one-way bearing 
cooperating to permit said sprocket means to rotate 
relative to said sliding member only in a direction 
which advances said screws towards said predetermined 
position. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example only, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, wherein: 
Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a screw 
feeding device according to one embodiment of the 
present invention; Figure 2 is a perspective view of the screw feeding 
device of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a
