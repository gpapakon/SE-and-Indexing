<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polysilanes which are useful 
as functional polymers such as nonlinear optical materials 
or electroconductive polymers, and to a method for 
synthesizing the same. Polysilanes are known to be useful as functional 
polymers such as nonlinear optical materials or 
electroconductive polymers ["Synthesis and Application of 
Organic Silicon Polymers" JMC (1989); Report of the National 
Chemical Laboratory for Industry, 8, 569 (1989); J. Chem. 
Rev. 89, 1359 (1989)]. Synthetic methods of polysilanes of Formula [I] 
include: 
(1) polycondensation of dichlorosilanes with an alkali 
metal such as sodium [J. Chem. Rev. 89, 1359 (1989)], (2) dehydrogenative coupling of polyhydrosilanes catalyzed 
by a transition metal complex [Can. J. Chem., 65, 1804 
(1987); J. Organomet. Chem., 27, C31 (1971)],  
 (3) anion polymerization of disilabicyclooctadiene which is 
an equivalent of disilene [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 111, 7641 
(1989)],  (4) electrochemical polymerization of 
dichlorodiorganosilanes [J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 1160 
(1990)], and (5) ring-opening polymerization of cyclotetrasilanes with a 
catalytic amount of butyllithium [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 113, 
1046 (1991)]. Of these methods, the methods (1) and (4) have problems 
in that the functional group which can be introduced is 
limited, and the molecular weight distribution is dispersed. The method (2) has problems in that the substrates are 
limited to a monosubstituted silanes, and the molecular 
weight distribution is dispersed. The method (3) has a problem in that the disilene 
equivalent used as a starting material is difficult to be 
synthesized. In the method (5), usable substrate is structurally 
limited. Physical properties of a polysilane are affected by the 
molecular weight distribution and the sequence order of 
substituents on the main chain. Therefore, to obtain a 
polysilane which has uniform electrical or optical 
properties, it is necessary to synthesize a polysilane which  
 
has homogeneous molecular distribution. Further, in order 
to achieve desired functions, it is preferable that the 
substituent arrangement order can be controlled. The inventors have conducted intensive studies on a 
polysilane which has homogeneous molecular weight and has 
various functional groups and an industrially applicable 
synthetic method. As a result, it has been found that a 
polysilane having a completely homogeneous molecular weight 
can be synthesized by reacting a small-ring polysilane with 
an organolithium reagent, followed by
