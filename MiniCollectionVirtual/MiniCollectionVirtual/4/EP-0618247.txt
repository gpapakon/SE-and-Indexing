<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyesters of 
2,6-naphthalenecarboxylic acid having a reduced crystallization 
rate. More specifically the present invention relates to 
polyesters of 2,6-naphthalenecarboxylic acid, having 
a reduced crystallization rate, modified with the 
introduction of co-monomers consisting of dihydroxyterminated 
polyether poliols. The food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries 
at present use packaging composed of various polymeric 
materials to preserve food, drugs, cosmetics, detergents, 
fine chemicals etc. One of the most interesting groups of polymers is 
that of saturated polyesters and in particular polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET) whose use in the preparation 
of biorientated hollow containers is widely 
illustrated in U.S. patent 3.733.309. This material has interesting physico-chemical 
characteristics such as gas-barrier properties and good  
 
mechanical properties. For some applications, however, 
for example beer containers, the oxygen-barrier properties 
are not sufficient. It has been observed, in fact, 
that when bottled in PET, beer deteriorates from an 
organolectic point of view due to contact with oxygen 
which is able to migrate throught the walls of the 
container. To reduce or eliminate this inconvenience, proposals 
have been made in literature to modify PET with 
co-monomers such as isophthalic acid or naphthalendicarboxylic 
acid or mixtures of PET with other polyesters. 
Examples of said literature are U.S. patents 
4.403.090, 4.398.017, 4.622.268, 4.388.456 and 
4.578.437. It has been generally recognized however that the 
homopolymer of ethylene glycol and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic 
acid, i.e. poly(ethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate) 
(PEN) has not only shown improved barrier 
properties with respect to PET but also much higher 
glass transition temperatures. A negative characteristic of PEN lies in the high 
crystallization rate. This negative characteristic is 
particularly felt in the production by blow-moulding of 
food containers, especially refillable bottles. In this 
case it is necessary to produce parisons with a greater 
thickness than that of the parisons used in traditional 
bottles.  A greater thickness creates problems concerning 
the crystallization of the internal part of the parison 
owing to a greater difficulty in discharging the heat 
and also a crystallization rate of the PEN which is 
too high. Crystallization of the parison causes a lower 
mechanical resistance and the opacification of the end 
product with evident
