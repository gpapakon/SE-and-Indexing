A method for the diagnosis of non-Insulin dependent 
Diabetes Mellitus or a genetically determined 

predisposition therefor, characterised in that skeletal 
muscle cells of given people are examined for the 

presence of the human Insulin Receptor of type B (HIR-B). 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the examination is carried out with the help of special 

oligonucleotides, which can be used as primers in a PCR 
amplification reaction of cDNA derived from RNA of a 

tissue so as to distinguish between HIR-A and HIR-B RNA. 
A method according to claim 2 characterised in that 
an oligonucleotide primer is used in producing cDNA from 

the RNA of a tissue which is complementary to nucleotides 
2858 to 2879 of the human insulin receptor A cDNA 

sequence. 
A method according to claim 2 or claim 3 
characterised in that a first oligonucleotide is used 

which is complementary to the sequence of nucleotides 
2327 to 2348 of a cDNA sequence which codes for human 

insulin receptor A and a second oligonucleotide is used 
which corresponds to the sequence of nucleotides 2136 to 

2257 of a cDNA sequence coding for human insulin receptor 
type A. 
A method according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the skeletal muscle cells are 

obtained through a biopsy. 
The use of an oligonucleotide as a primer in a 
method according to one of claims 2 to 5, characterised 

in that it comprises a sequence that is complementary to  
 

nucleotides 2327 to 2348 of the human insulin receptor A 
cDNA sequence. 
The use of an oligonucleotide as a primer in a 
method according to one of claims 2 to 5, characterised 

in that it comprises a sequence which corresponds to the 
cDNA sequence of nucleotides 2136 to 2257 of human 

insulin receptor A. 
The use of an oligonucleotide as a primer in a 
method according to one of claims 2 to 5 in the 

production of cDNA from RNA of skeletal muscle cells 
characterised in that it comprises a sequence which is 

complementary to the sequence of nucleotides 2858 to 2879 
of the human insulin receptor A cDNA sequence.
