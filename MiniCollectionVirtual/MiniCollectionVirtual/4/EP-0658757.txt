<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for non-intrusive, in-situ chemical 
analysis of a lubricant film in running reciprocating machinery 

under true operating conditions by means of infrared reflection-absorption 
spectroscopy. A moving first member (5) of the reciprocating 

machinery is illuminated with I.R. radiation; reflected I.R. 
radiation is collected; its intensity at selected wavelengths which 

are specific to chemical species of interest, is analyzed; I.R. 
absorbance data are generated for the lubricant film intervening at 

the interface of a second member (4) of the said reciprocating machinery 
and the said first moving member; and from the data, thus obtained, 

information on the chemical species of interest, is derived.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
non-intrusive in situ chemical analysis of a lubricant film in 
running reciprocating machinery under true operating conditions by 
means of infrared (I.R.) absorption - reflection spectroscopy. The interaction with matter of electromagnetic radiation of 
wavelength in the infrared region induces either rotational or 
vibrational energy level transitions, or both, within the molecules 
involved. The frequencies of infrared radiation absorbed by a molecule 
are determined by its rotational levels and by the force constants 
of the bonds in the molecule. Since these energy levels and force 
constants are usually unique for each molecule, so also the infrared 
spectrum of each molecule is usually unique. Although almost every 
organic compound has a unique infrared spectrum, various groupings 
within a molecule have well-defined regions of absorption. For example, hydroxyl groups in alcohols absorb strongly at 
2.8, 7.3 and about 8.5 µm (wavelength); ester carbonyls absorb from 
5.7 to 5.8 µm (wavelength); and free amino groups absorb at 3.0 and 
from 6.1 to 6.4 µm (wavelength). Because of their individuality, 
infrared spectra of organic compounds are considered equivalent to, 
or superior to, the preparation of chemical derivatives for the 
identification of species in organic chemistry. For this reason the infrared portion of the spectrum 
(wavelengths about 1 to about 300 µm) is often called the 
fingerprint region. In reciprocating machinery such as e.g. an I.C. (Internal 
Combustion) engine the piston lubricant will be affected by 
oxidation and/or will be contaminated by fuel combustion products. For such machinery there is a need to monitor the chemical fate  
 
of lubricants at the critical combustion/lubrication interface in 
order to assess additive/base oil effectiveness. Further, there is a need to measure the time evolution of 
chemical species of interest such as oxidation degradation products 
of piston lubricants. It is an object of the invention to provide a method and 
apparatus based upon the I.R. reflection-absorption principle which 
allow a chemical analysis and characterization of a lubricant-film 
in a harsh reciprocating machinery environment. The invention therefore provides a method for non-intrusive, 
in-situ chemical analysis of a lubricant film in running 
reciprocating machinery under true operating conditions by means of 
infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy, comprising the steps of 
illuminating a moving
