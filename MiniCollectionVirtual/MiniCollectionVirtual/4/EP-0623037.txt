<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING PARAMETERS OF THE MOTION OF AN OBJECTTechnical Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining desired parameters of the motion of an object, such as, for example, the estimated carry distance of a golf ball.Background of the InventionVarious methods and apparatus have been devised for measuring characteristics of the motion of an object, such as velocity, estimated distance the object will travel ("carry distance") , spin, momentum, and trajectory. Radar devices have been developed which utilize the Doppler frequency shift to measure the velocity of the moving object. Very briefly, electromagnetic energy, such as microwave radar energy, which is transmitted toward and reflected by a moving object undergoes a frequency shift, the magnitude of which is proportional to the velocity of the object relative to the transmitter. Samples of the transmitted and reflected radiation are mixed and processed to obtain a difference signal having a frequency which is equal to the difference between the transmitted and reflected frequencies, this difference being the Doppler shift. Once the difference frequency has been obtained, the relative velocity of the object can be readily calculated.Many Doppler radar devices count the number of pulses i the difference signal during a predetermined period of time o "window." If the width of the window (i.e., the period o time) is chosen properly, the number of pulses which ar 

counted will equal the velocity of the object in the desired units (such as miles per hours or kilometers per hour) . To determine the width of the window, it is necessary to apply the f 

 fd = (2ftvr)/vc where fd s the Doppler frequency; ft is the frequency of the transmitted radiation; vr is the relative velocity of the object; and vc is the velocity of light in appropriate units. For a transmission frequency ft of about 10.5 GHz (a typical operating frequency for Doppler radar), fd equals about 31.3 vr (in miles per hour) . The width of the window is the inverse of 31.3, or about 31.9 milliseconds, and the number of difference frequency pulses counted will give the object's velocity in miles per hour. For example, an object moving 100 miles " per hour would produce a signal with a Doppler difference frequency of about 3,130 Hz. The number of pulses in the signal counted during a window having a width of 31.9 milliseconds is about 100, which is the velocity of the object in miles per hour. A significant disadvantage of pulse
