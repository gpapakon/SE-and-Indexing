<ABSTRACT>
A lock useful for a motor vehicle in which a housing (1) carries a key receiving barrel (2), the barrel is capable of axial movement in an axis X, a solenoid (14) acts to constrain the axial movement is provided in the housing which can be actuated by an infrared or magnetic strip receiver (61, 64). The lock is such that until the barrel is held by the solenoid a key inserted and turned in the lock will merely turn the lock barrel without actuating the lock bolt (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
 A LOCK PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR MOTOR VEHICLESThe present invention relates to a lock primarily intend for motor vehicles but which may be used for oth purposes.Motor vehicle locks commonly comprise a barrel type lock which the key when inserted is turned to switch on vehic services then to actuate the starter motor. It is comm to include a steering column lock to prevent the steeri wheel from being turned when the key has been removed fr the lock. Many of these locks have, however, only limit security in that they can be picked, forced, shimme drilled or extracted without great expertis Consequently, there has been a tendency to fit alarms t vehicles. These, however, are increasingly ignored and ca themselves be circumvented.An improved lock is shown in my US Patent No. 1,794,796 however, this has certain disadvantages in that it is to easy to disable or "upset".It is an object of the present invention to provide a improved lock suitable for a motor vehicle.A lock according to the invention comprises a housing, key receiving barrel mounted in the housing, the barre capable of axial movement relative to the housing, means t constrain the axial movement of the barrel, sai constraining ' means comprising an electrically operabl solenoid arranged to be actuated by an initiating signal. 

 An advantage of the lock according to the invention is that if the barrel is unconstrained any attempt to force the lock will cause the barrel to move axially to an upset position such that rotation of the barrel cannot unlock the lock. A further advantage of this arrangement is that when a correct key is in the lock and it is desired to quickly disable the lock in the event of a highjack, it is only necessary to punch the key to upset the lock.In a preferred embodiment of the invention the lock is arranged to actuate an electrical switch to provide electrical supplies to a vehicle and may also actuate a starter motor. The lock may also be adapted to move a bolt into and out of a steering column.In the embodiment where the initiating signal is derived from an infrared receiver within the housing, a sensor is mounted to a front face of the lock housing. The receiver circuitry is housed within the housing. If a correct infrared signal is received by the receiver the solenoid will be actuated to prevent axial movement of the lock barrel. This enables a correct key to be inserted in the lock barrel without upsetting the lock. The key can then be turned to remove a steering wheel lock where this is fitted. The key can be then

1. A lock comprising a housing , a key receiving barrel mounted in the housing, the barrel being capable of axial movement relative to the housing, means to constrain the axial movement of the barrel, said constraining means comprising an electrically operable solenoid arranged to be actuated by an initiating signal.
2. A lock as claimed in claim 1 wherein the lock is arranged to actuate an electrical switch to provide electrical supplies to a vehicle.
3. A lock as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein rotation of the barrel is arranged to move a bolt into and out of a steering column.
4. A lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein an infrared signal receiver is housed within the housing and is so arranged to actuate the solenoid.
5. A lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein a magnetic strip reader is housed within the housing and is so arranged to actuate the solenoid.
6. A lock as claimed in claim 3 wherein an operating block is arranged in the housing to act on the bolt and to retract the bolt, said block being arranged to be obstructed from locking the steering until the key is removed from the barrel.
7. A lock as claimed in claim 6 wherein the block is obstructed by means of a lever actuated by a plate slidably 


arranged in a key entry, the plate being slidable sideway relative to the barrel axis.
8. A lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7 wherei a plunger is sprung mounted to the solenoid armature t normally apply pressure on a sleeve of the lock barrel t inhibit rearward movement of the barrel. 

AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 21 June 1993 (21.06.93); original claim 8 cancelled; original claim 1 amended; new claim 9 added; other claims unchanged (2 pages)]
1. A lock comprising a housing, a key receiving barrel 5 mounted in the housing, the barrel being capable of axial movement relative to the housing characterised by said axial movement of the barrel is between a key inserting position and an upset position and wherein means are provided to constrain the axial movement of the barrel in 0 - the key inserting position, said constraining means comprising an electrically operable solenoid arranged to be actuated by an initiating signal.
2. A lock as claimed in claim 1 wherein the lock is arranged to actuate an electrical switch to provide electrical supplies to a vehicle.
3. A lock as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein rotation of the barrel is arranged to move a bolt into and out of a steering column.
4. A lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein an infrared signal receiver is housed within the housing and is so arranged to actuate the solenoid.
5. A lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein a magnetic strip reader is housed within the housing and is so arranged to actuate the solenoid.
6. A lock as claimed in claim 3 wherein an operating block is arranged in the housing to act on the bolt and to retract the bolt, said block being arranged-- to be obstructed from locking the steering until the key is removed from the barrel. 


 7. A lock as claimed in claim 6 wherein the block is obstructed by means of a lever actuated by a plate slidably arranged in a key entry, the plate being slidable sideways
"
relative to the barrel axis.
8. A lock as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein the receiver or reader includes a predetermined time delay operable so that if the key is not operated within a predetermined time, the solenoid will release the constraint on the key barrel.
9. A lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8 wherein a plunger is sprung mounted to the solenoid armature to normally apply pressure on a sleeve of the lock barrel to inhibit rearward movement of the barrel.
