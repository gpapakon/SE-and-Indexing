<ABSTRACT>
It would be desirable to produce stabilised aqueous alkaline hydrogen peroxide compositions for domestic use as a general purpose bleach and disinfectant as an alternative to hypochlorite solutions, in view of fears concerning the effect environmentally of chlorinaceous compounds. A stabilised buffered alkaline hydrogen peroxide solution is obtained by incorporating disodium tetraborate decahydrate and cyclohexane-1,2-diaminotetramethylene phosphonic acid as buffer and stabiliser respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aqueous alkaline 
hydrogen peroxide formulations, and more particularly to 
a stabilised and buffered formulation. Households, for many years have employed a general 
purpose bleach and disinfectant for cleaning and 
disinfecting hard surfaces such as floors, work surfaces 
or walls, and especially for disinfecting sanitaryware 
and waste pipework. One class of formulation which has 
been especially popular is based on aqueous alkaline 
hypochlorite solutions. Such formulations have been 
very effective, but the general public has become aware 
of academic studies which have shown that in certain 
circumstances, chlorinaceous compounds can interact with 
the organic compounds in the environment with the 
generation of carcinogens or other noxious substances. 
In consequence, a need has arisen to develop substitute 
products to offer a "green" alternative for those who 
wish to avoid contacting hypochlorite with domestic waste 
or introducing it into effluents that will eventually 
pass into the municipal sewage treatment works. Hydrogen peroxide is a product which is generally 
acceptable environmentally, because its decomposition 
products are oxygen and water. It has been supplied to 
the household market in acidic formulations, but it would 
be preferable to employ alkaline formulations in order to 
enhance the performance of hydrogen peroxide. However,  
 
its employment in the past in aqueous alkaline media has 
been hindered because alkaline peroxide solutions are 
prone to decomposition during storage, such as occurs 
inevitably during the period of distribution from the 
manufacturer to sales outlets in supermarkets or the 
like, and storage on their shelves and subsequently in 
the home of the consumer. The net result of excessive 
decomposition is that the product progressively loses its 
efficacy and thereby its shelf life is curtailed. 
The stability of aqueous alkaline hydrogen peroxide 
solutions has been improved in GB 2 072 643 and EP-B-00 
76 166, both to Interox Chemicals Limited, by 
employing an aminomethylene phosphonic acid together with 
a low weight alcohol such as ethanol or isopropanol as a 
stabiliser system, but the presence of the alcohol 
inevitably reduces the flash point of the composition and 
introduces additional processing costs. The 
incorporation of certain aminomethylene phosphonic acids 
as stabiliser in alkaline hydrogen peroxide solutions has 
also been described in International Application WO 
91/09807 also to Interox Chemicals

<CLAIMS>
A storage stable composition suitable for use 
domestically as a general purpose household bleach and 

disinfectant which consists essentially of an aqueous 
alkaline solution of from about 1 to about 10% w/w 

hydrogen peroxide, at least 0.2% w/w of a borate buffer 
introduced as sodium tetraborate decahydrate, alkali 

metal hydroxide in an amount which is sufficient 
together with the borate buffer to generate a pH in the 

range of from at least 7 to about 9.5, as stabiliser 
cyclohexane-1,2-diaminotetrakismethylene phosphonic 

acid or water soluble salt thereof in a concentration 
calculated as the acid of at least 150 ppm and 

optionally a surfactant. 
A composition according to claim 1 in which the 
concentration of stabiliser is selected in the range of 

from 200 to 1000 ppm 
A composition according to either preceding claim in 
which the concentration of borate buffer is from about 

0.4 to about 0.6% w/w calculated as disodium 
tetraborate decahydrate. 
A composition according to any preceding claim which 
has a pH of from about 7.5 to about 8.5. 
A composition according to any preceding claim which 
contains at least 0.25% w/w surfactant. 
A composition according to any preceding claim which 
contains an amine oxide surfactant. 
A composition according to claim 6 in which the amine 
oxide contains a linear C10 to C16 alkyl and two short 

chain alkyl substituents.  
 
A process for producing a stabilised aqueous alkaline solution of 
hydrogen peroxide in which hydrogen peroxide is introduced to a 

concentration of at least 3% w/w in the presence of an effective amount of 
cyclohexane-1,2-diaminotetrakismethylene phosphonic acid or water soluble 

salt thereof as stabiliser into an aqueous solution of at least 0.2% w/w 
disodium tetraborate decahydrate, the composition is adjusted to a pH of 

from 8 to 9.5 where necessary, by the introduction of an alkali metal 
hydroxide, and at least 1% w/w of a surfactant is introduced, either before 

or after the hydrogen peroxide.
