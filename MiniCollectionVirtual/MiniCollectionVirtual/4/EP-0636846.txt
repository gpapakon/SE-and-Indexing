<ABSTRACT>
A system (40) for distributing air in rooms (1) 
intended for the processing of food products comprises 

a conditioning unit (8) which sends air into two pipes 
(14, 15) and from these into two distribution manifolds 

(23, 24). Variable-speed fans (19, 20) are interposed 
between the pipes (14, 15) and the manifolds (23, 24) 

for separately and precisely regulating the flow-rate 
of air to the manifolds (23, 24) in order to perform 

food-processing cycles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a system 
for distributing air in rooms for the processing of 
food products. In particular, some examples of use relate to 
charcuterie-curing cycles using dehumidifying systems, 
for example, for salami, dry-cured ham and the like, or 
relate to cooking systems using dry- or moist-air 
ovens, for example, for mortadella and cooked 
charcuterie, and possibly also smoked products, or 
relate to the production of cheeses and the like. For example, suitable rooms dehumidified by appropriate 
conditioners are used for processes such as drying and 
curing during the commercial production of charcuterie. The product is subjected to cycles providing for 
conditioned air-flows which pass over the charcuterie 
to remove the moisture therein. The charcuterie then needs a period of rest in order to 
recover, after which the cycle starts again. The process takes place in a suitable room which has at 
least two substantially flat, facing walls, and into 
which the air is blown vertically in two separate flows 
which descend along the walls. When they reach the floor, the flows are diverted in 
contact with the floor until they meet, forming a  
 
vertically ascending column of air. The position of the column relative to the facing walls 
along which the flows descend is determined by the 
flow-rates of the two starting flows. If their flow-rates are equal, the ascending column 
will form in the centre of the room. If one of the 
two flow-rates is greater than the other, the ascending 
column will form nearer to the flow with the lesser 
flow-rate. By adjusting the two flow-rates, it is therefore 
possible to vary the position of the ascending column 
which will pass over the charcuterie, which is stowed 
in the room, raised from the floor. Normally, the flow-rates of the two flows are adjusted 
with the use of shutters or plates in the delivery 
ducts of the conditioner. These enable the cross-section reserved for the passage 
of the individual flows to be varied but generates 
non-uniform flow-resistance. These systems have the disadvantage that they do not 
allow for fine adjustment of the flow-rates and their 
behaviour cannot easily be predicted at the design 
stage. The same problem is also encountered in the other 
applications mentioned above. The technical problem upon which the present invention 
is based is that of providing an air-distribution  
 
system which overcomes the problems mentioned whilst 
satisfying the requirements mentioned above with 
reference

<CLAIMS>
A system for distributing air (40) in rooms (1) for 
the processing of food products, comprising at least 

one air-delivery pipe (11), characterized in that the 
pipe (11) divides into two ducts (14, 15) which direct 

the air into separate distribution manifolds (23, 24), 
fans (19, 20), driven at variable speeds, being 

interposed between the ducts (14, 15) and the manifolds 
(23, 24). 
An air-distribution system (40) according to Claim 
2, characterized in that the delivery pipe (11) 

comprises at least one thermal conditioning unit (8). 
An air-distribution system (40) according to Claim 
1, characterized in that the fans (19, 20) are driven 

by respective electric motors (22, 22a) supplied with 
alternating electrical current of variable frequency 

and/or voltage, regulated by respective inverters (41, 
41a). 
An air-distribution system (40) according to Claim 
3, characterized in that the inverters (41, 41a) are 

controlled by a suitable microprocessor (42) using a 
programme which takes account of the hygrothermal and 

air-speed data relating to the room (1) for the 
processing of the food products.
