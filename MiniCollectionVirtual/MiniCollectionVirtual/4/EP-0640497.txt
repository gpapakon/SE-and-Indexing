<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tyre has a block pattern which is 
divided by a centre main groove extending straight 

on the tyre equator, two outer main grooves 
extending straight outside the centre main groove, 

inner lateral grooves crossing between the centre 
and outer main grooves, and outer lateral grooves 

crossing between the outer main grooves and tread 
edges so as to make two inner block rows and two 

outer block rows. The outer lateral grooves cross 
the outer main grooves, and the inner lateral 

grooves cross the centre main groove at an 
inclination opposite to an inclination direction of 

the outer lateral grooves. The block pattern is 
satisfied with the following relation; 


0.3 ≦ Ni/No ≦ 0.7 
0.1W ≦ WG1 ≦ 0.17W 
0.1W ≦ WG2 ≦ 0.17W

0.3W ≦ WBo ≦ 0.6W

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre 
capable of reducing pass-by noise while maintaining 
steering stability, wet grip performance and other 
running performances. As vehicle speeds are getting higher along with 
advancement of automotive technology in recent 
years, the vehicle running noise is increasing, and 
its control is demanded. In the tread of the tyre, a block pattern, typically 
shown in Fig. 4, is formed by a plurality of 
circumferential grooves (a), (b) extending 
continuously in the tyre circumferential direction 
and multiple lateral grooves (d), (e) crossing these 
circumferential grooves. Therefore, when running in 
rain, the water between the tread surface and the 
road surface is discharged through these grooves, 
and the wet grip performance is enhanced. When such lateral grooves are provided in a 
multiplicity, the air compressed between the tread 
surface and the road surface passes through the 
grooves suddenly, and occurs intermittently, which  
 
causes a noise called a pumping noise. Such noise 
is often noted in block pattern tyres having 
multiple lateral grooves. To suppress such noise, it has been attempted to 
lower the speed of the air passing the lateral 
grooves by 
1. decreasing the sectional area of the 
lateral grooves, or 2. bending the lateral grooves. By these measures, although the noise is slightly 
reduced, measure 1 causes a loss in grip 
performance, especially wet grip performance, and 
measure 2 causes uneven wear on the sides of the 
lateral grooves, thereby lowering the travelling 
performances and durability of the tyre. It is hence a primary object of the invention to 
present a pneumatic tyre capable of reducing the 
pass-by noise while maintaining the running 
performances. The present inventor has discovered:  
 
(1) The noise frequency is dispersed and the 
noise is lessened by differing the pitch of blocks 
between the block rows. (2) The wet performance is enhanced by 
increasing the sectional area of the main grooves 
extending in the circumferential direction. (3) The turning performance is enhanced by 
setting the block pitch in the inner block rows 
larger than the outer block pitch so as to make the 
shape of the outer blocks oblong, while 
strengthening the grip force and brake performance. (4) The water discharge performance is 
enhanced and noise generation is further suppressed 
by smoothly continuing between the lateral grooves 
in the inner block rows and lateral grooves in the 
outer block rows. According to the present
