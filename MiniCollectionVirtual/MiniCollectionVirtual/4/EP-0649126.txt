<ABSTRACT>
A heat resistant label and a process for making the 
same are disclosed. The label is composed of a film made of a 

silicone resin in an amount of 20 to 95 wt% and an inorganic 
monocrystalline fiber in an amount of 80 to 5 wt%, together 

with an adhesive made of silicone resin in an amount of 10 to 
80% and a metal powder in 90 to 20 wt%.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a label. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a heat-resistant 
label which can be printed on a heat-resistant material by a 
heat treatment at an elevated temperature as high as 200 to 700 
°C. In various industrial fields such as food, machinery 
and chemical, a label on which letters, symbols, patterns, etc. 
have been printed, i.e., patterned label is stuck on products 
or their packaging materials to control the production process. 
A typical example of such a process control is a system 
utilizing a bar code printed label. In the bar code control 
system, data such as production conditions and price of 
products are electro-mechanically read out from the bar code 
label to control the production process and sales management. However, an ordinary bar code label with adhesive obtained by 
applying an adhesive made of acrylic resin or the like to a 
film for label made of a resin or paper having a poor heat 
resistance is liable to be decomposed and evaporated both the 
film and adhesive under severe temperature conditions as high 
as not lower than 300 °C. Thus, it cannot be used in industries 
requiring high temperature treatment processes such as 
ceramics, iron industry and glass industry, e.g., process for  
 
the preparation of television cathode ray tubes including 
sealing and annealing steps conducted at 400 to 600 °C. Thus, 
films for label and adhesives which can withstand elevated 
temperatures as high as not lower than 300 °C have been 
desired. On the other hand, heat-resistant films obtained by a 
process which comprises impregnating a woven cloth of long 
inorganic amorphous fiber, such as glass fiber and rock wool, 
with a heat-resistant binder resin such as silicone resin and 
polyamide resin, and then curing the binder have been 
heretofore known. Some of these heat-resistant films can 
withstand an elevated temperature as high as higher than 300 °C 
only for a short period of time. However, if such a heat-resistant label is used to 
prepare a label which is used in the foregoing application, the 
label can be attached only on products having a plain and 
smooth surface because the film is rigid and thus exhibits an 
insufficient flexibility. When the label is exposed to a high 
temperature while being attached on the surface of a cathode 
ray tube or metal plate, it is discolorated or cannot withstand 
the thermal expansion of the cathode ray tube or metal plate 
and thus suffers from cracking and peeling. Thus, the use of 
such a
