<ABSTRACT>
A pallet made of plastic consists essentially of a plate (15) and a plurality of feet (6 to 14). The plate (15) is, for its part, constructed in a sandwich method from an upper plate part (1) and a lower plate part (2). The plate parts are connected tightly to each other at the edge by butt-welding and are provided with reinforcing ribs (17). The feet (6 to 14), likewise welded by the butt-welding method to the underside of the plate (15), are terminated flush at the outside on their underside. This takes place by means of a peripheral frame (27) which is stiffened by a central batten (4).
