<ABSTRACT>
The feeders (35 to 42) for forming portions of the product, 
the product supply reservoir (44) and the valve means (34 - 

43) which switch the connection of the feeders between the 
said reservoir and the feed nozzles (5) located on the 

feeding and packaging carousel (1-2) are separate from the 
carousel itself and are mounted in any position in which 

they can be easily inspected, and the feeders are connected 
to the said nozzles by means of the fixed part (17) of at 

least one rotary joint (2-17) disposed coaxially on the 
carousel. This joint is characterized by high reliability in 

operation, is designed to facilitate washing and sterilization 
of all the circuits through which the product flows, 

and if necessary can be easily dismantled for inspection of 
the various components. The rotary joint may be designed to 

form distribution chambers for the monitoring of the residual 
product in the nozzles during the inoperative transit 

of these components and/or for the monitoring of a flow of 
any sanitizing gas which the said nozzles are required to 

blow into the containers at the filling stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to automatic machines for the 
metered feeding and packaging in bottles, flacons or other 
containers of fluid products in general and in particular 
liquid or cream products, for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, 
food, or other use. Known high-output machines are normally 
of the carousel type and have at each operating point a 
metered volume feeder which is alternately connected to the 
product supply reservoir and to the nozzle which discharges 
the portion into the packaging containers. These machines 
are remarkably bulky and complex in construction and 
therefore present maintenance problems due to the difficulty 
of access to the many components installed in the machines. 
Owing to the considerable quantity of the various 
components, the stages of washing and sterilization of the 
machine require relatively long periods, the more so because 
of the necessity of thermally treating the said components. 
In order to partially avoid these disadvantages, carousel or 
transfer machines have been devised, with a limited number 
of metered volume feeders which operate in sequence, with an 
alternating movement, while the containers to be filled 
advance with a continuous movement. These machines, which 
are less complex and less bulky than the former type, still 
have the disadvantage of disturbing, with the alternating 
movement of the feeders, the flow of sterile air which is 
normally created in the environment in which the machine 
operates when the products to be packaged require this  
 
condition. Moreover, even if the feeding stations are 
operated with appropriate acceleration and deceleration, the 
latter machines are markedly slower than the former and give 
rise to vibrations which, inter alia, may cause the product 
to drip from the feed nozzles. From DE-A-3 024 271 a mechanichal device is known for 
filling containers with dosed amounts of fluid or powdered 
products. From FR-A-657 427 a machine is known for filling 
containers with powdered products or the like, of the kind 
in which the containers to be filled as well as the 
corresponding flow ducts are carried by a rotating device of 
the machine. The invention as defined in claim 1 
is intended to avoid these and other 
disadvantages with the following idea for a solution. Within 
a high-output automatic machine of the carousel type, the 
feeders, present in the proportion of one for each operating 
point of the carousel, or in another appropriate quantity, 
are arranged outside the carousel, together with the supply

<CLAIMS>
Automatic carousel machine, for the metered feeding and 
packaging of fluid products, characterized in that it has, 

coaxially with the carousel, at least one rotary joint, of 
which one part (2) rotates with the carousel and is 

connected to product feed nozzles (5), the said part of 
the joint comprising a number of fluid flow channels 

corresponding to the number of nozzles, each channel being 
connected to a corresponding nozzle, while another part of 

the joint (17) is fixed and is connected by fixed ducts (26 
to 33) to a set of metered volume feeders (35 to 42) and 

to corresponding valve means (34-43) which, together 
with a supply reservoir (44) of the product to be fed, may 

be located in any suitable position including one remote 
from the carousel, within or outside any environment (45) in 

which the said carousel operates in a controlled atmosphere, 
in a convenient and accessible position for any routine or 

special maintenance requirement, means being provided to 
synchronize the rotation of the carousel with the sequence 

of operation of the metered volume feeders and the 
corresponding valve means, so that, through the said rotary 

joint, the metered volume feeders are caused to be connected 
with the nozzles of the carousel in the stage of discharge 

of the portion of product into the containers, and to be 
isolated from the said nozzles and connected to the supply 

reservoir at the stage in which a subsequent portion of 
product is drawn from the reservoir.  

 
Machine according to Claim 1, in which the rotary joint 
is formed by at least two discs of suitable material, for 

example ceramic material, with one overlying the other, the 
lower disc (2) being fixed to the turret (1) of the  

 
carousel, rotating with it and carrying, laterally and at 

equal angular intervals, the nozzles (5) which interact with 
the containers to introduce the portion of product into 

them, these nozzles being connected by corresponding holes 
(9 to 16) to apertures (109 to 116) of any suitable form 

disposed on the upper face of the said lower disc, and 
communicating, at least for the period necessary for the 

discharge of the product into the containers, with 
corresponding apertures (226 to 233) of any suitable form 

provided in the lower face of the upper disc (17) of the 
joint, which is fixed and which meets ducts (26 to 33), in 

the proportion of at least one for each nozzle of the 
carousel, and which are connected to the assembly of metered 

volume feeders (35 to 42) and corresponding valve means 
(34-43) which switch at the precise moment when the feeders 

move from the suction to the delivery stage, for connection 
respectively to the reservoir (44) or to the feed circuits 

passing through the rotary joint. 
Machine according to the preceding claims, in which the 
upper face of the lower rotating disc (2) of the rotary 

joint has open concentric circular channels (209 to 216), 
suitably spaced apart, in the proportion of at least one for 

each nozzle (5) and with their centres in the axis of 
rotation of the disc, while on the lower face of the upper 

fixed disc (17) of the said joint there are open holes (226 
to 233) in the proportion of at least one for each duct 

connected to the metered volume feeders, these holes being 
arranged for connection with the corresponding circular 

channels mentioned previously.  
 
Machine according to Claims 1 and 2, in which the upper 
face of the lower rotating disc (2) of the rotary joint has 

open holes (109 to 116), in the proportion of one for each 
product feed nozzle (5), disposed in separate concentric 

tracks, these holes being made to communicate, during the 
rotation of the carousel, with curved concentric channels 

(326 to 333) open on the lower face of the fixed upper disc 
(17) of the said joint, each of which channels is connected 

or connectable to a corresponding metered volume feeder and 
has an angular extent sufficient to permit connection to 

each nozzle (5) for the introduction of the portion of 
product into the container which rotates on the carousel, 

for example an extent of the order of approximately 180°, 
while over the remaining rotation path the said holes 

interact with closed parts of the upper disc and with any 
chamber (48) which may be connected to suction means (49) to 

prevent the dripping of the product from the nozzles as they 
leave the filled container and move towards the next 

container. 
Machine according to Claim 4, in which the said 
concentric curved channels (326 to 333) extend for an angle 

minor of 180°, and for instance in the order of 140°, and 
the said open holes (109 to 116) are doubled by providing 

for each of said hole a diametrically opposed simmetric hole 
(109' to 116') on the rotating disc 2. 
Machine according to any one or more of the preceding 
claims, in which each product feed nozzle (5) has at least 

one supplementary longitudinal channel (205) to blow inert  
 

or sanitizing gas and/or gas for other suitable purposes 
into the containers (6) for packaging the portions of 

product, these channels meeting holes (50) which open on the 
upper face of the lower disc (2) of the rotary joint and 

which, when the nozzles interact with corresponding 
containers, communicate with a curved channel (51) opening 

on the lower face of the upper disc (17) of the said rotary 
joint, and connected by at least one duct (52) to the gas 

supply source. 
Machine according to any one or more of the preceding 
claims, in which the lower disc (2) of the rotary joint is 

provided at its top with an axial projection (102) with a 
lateral seal (21) which works in a corresponding coaxial 

socket (22) in the upper disc (17) which in turn carries on 
its circumference an integral ring (23) which with an 

internal annular seal (24) interacts with the outer lateral 
surface of the lower disc of the joint, means being provided 

to enable a relative axial displacement to be imparted, when 
required, to the two discs of the joint, the displacement 

being sufficient to form, between the opposing faces of the 
discs, a space (47) which, by means of the said seals, is 

sealed with respect to the exterior and in which the liquid 
for washing and sterilizing the circuits of the machine can 

circulate, so that the machine is prepared for a new 
operating cycle, the carousel being preferably halted in 

this stage. 
Machine according to Claim 7, characterized in that when 
the two discs (2-17) of the rotary joint are in contact with  

 
each other and in the active operating position, the annular 

seals (21-24) providing the seal in the washing and 
sterilization stage interact with recessed parts (122-25) of 

the opposing surfaces, so that they are not touched by these 
and so that friction which might damage the said seals is 

avoided. 
Machine according to the preceding claims, in which the 
upper fixed disc (17) of the rotary joint is integral with 

an axial shaft (18) associated with means which, when 
required, can lower or raise it to bring the joint into the 

operating condition or into the washing and sterilization 
condition respectively.
