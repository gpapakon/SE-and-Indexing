<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for filling 
such contents as cleanser, edible oil, etc., into a container and attaching a closing 
member on the container. Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication H1-58498 discloses 
a method of filling, which comprises a step of filling a content into a bottle 
(container) and a step of fitting a cap (closing member) on the bottle with the 
content therein. FR-A-2 606 006 discloses an apparatus provided with a conveyor 
for delivering closing members to a predetermined position. EP-A-0 535 946 relates to a filling apparatus comprising a 
closing member fitting unit for fitting a closing member on the 
container with the contents therein to close the container, a 
container conveyor, container holders carried by the container 
conveyor and each able to hold a container supplied from a 
container feed unit via the filling unit, the closing member 
fitting unit and a container take-out unit back to the 
container feed unit. Thus, bottles, conveyed on a conveyor, can be fed at a predetermined 
conveying speed and in a constant conveying position to a filling unit and also to 
a cap fitting unit. In other words, the bottles can be fed reliably in a timed relation 
to the cycle of operation of the filling and cap fitting units. In addition, the bottles 
can be fed such that they are stable in a predetermined filling position in the filling 
unit and a predetermined cap fitting position in the cap fitting unit.  
 It is an object of the invention that when filling contents into 
containers and fitting closing members thereon, the containers are fed at a 
predetermined conveying speed and in a predetermined conveying position to the 
filling and closing member fitting units, while the closing members are fed at a 
predetermined conveying speed and at a predetermined conveying position to the 
closing member fitting unit.  
 As claimed a filling apparatus comprises a filling unit for 
filling contents into a container, a closing member fitting 
unit for fitting a closing member on the container with the 
contents therein to close the container and a container 
conveyor. It further comprises container holders carried by 
the container conveyor and each able to hold a container 
supplied from a container feed unit via the filling unit, 
the closing member fitting unit and a container take-out 
unit back to the container feed unit. According to the 
invention the filling apparatus further comprises a closing 
member conveyor and closing member holders carried by
