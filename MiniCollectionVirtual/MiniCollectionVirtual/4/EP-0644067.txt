<ABSTRACT>
In order to insert a document (44) into an envelope (43),   (a) document delivery means (46) and envelope delivery means (45) are actuated, together with a device (11, 12, 16) for conveying the document between the document receiving station and the envelope receiving station; (b) the rotary assembly (32, 32') rotates from the envelope receiving position to the envelope ejecting position, while the conveying device (11, 12, 16) continues to be actuated; (c) when the rotary assembly is in the envelope ejecting position, the envelope removal means (47, 47') are actuated; and (d) the rotary assembly (32, 32') is returned to the envelope receiving position.

Apparatus for inserting a document into an envelope, cooperating 
with document delivering means (46) for delivering documents to the 

apparatus, envelope delivering means (45) for delivering envelopes to the 
apparatus and envelope collecting means (47, 47') for collecting envelopes 

from the apparatus, characterized in that it comprises :
 
   a rotating assembly (32, 32') displaceable between an envelope 

receiving position and an envelope discharging position, said rotating 
assembly comprising an envelope receiving station (1, 1') and a document 

receiving station (35, 36) as well as a transferring means (11, 12, 16) for 
transferring a document between said document receiving station and said 

envelope receiving station,
 
   said envelope receiving station (1, 1') and said document 

receiving station (35, 36) being located respectively in front of the envelope 
delivering means (45) and the document delivering means (46) when said 

rotating assembly is in said envelope receiving position,
 
   said envelope receiving station (1, 1') being located in front of the 

envelope collecting means (47, 47') when said rotating assembly is in said 
envelope discharging position,
 
   control means being provided for achieving the following 

operation cycle : 

a) said rotating assembly being in said envelope receiving 
position, the document delivering means (46) and envelope delivering means 

(45) are actuated, as well as said document transferring means (11, 12, 16) 
between said document 
receiving station and said envelope receiving station, 
b) said rotating assembly (32, 32') rotates from said envelope 
receiving position to said envelope discharging position, while said 

transferring means (11, 12, 16) is still operated, 
c) said rotating assembly being in the envelope discharging 
position, the envelope collecting means (47, 47') is operated, 
d) said rotating assembly (32, 32') is brought back to said 
envelope receiving position. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
document transferring means includes at least a set of endless belts (11, 12) 

cooperating with a drum (16). 
Apparatus according to any one of the previous claims, 
characterized in that said document receiving station (35, 36) includes fixed 

means for guiding said document towards said transferring means. 
Apparatus according to any one of the previous claims, 
characterized in that said envelope receiving station (1, 1') includes two 

moveable gripping and guiding fingers whose distance therebetween is 
controlled by control means, and onto which the envelope delivering means 

engages an open envelope, said open envelope (43) having then its inside 
located directly downstreams of said document transferring means (44). 
Apparatus according to any one of the previous claims, 
characterized in that at least a portion of the envelope collecting means (47, 

47') can be shifted away during step 
b
 of the movement cycle.
