<ABSTRACT>
The invention is concerned with plastic containers, which 
may be refilled with granular product many times. A means 

for fitting a dispensing device (12) to the outside of the 
plastic container (11) in such a way that it is safely stored 

and yet cannot come into direct contact with the granular 
product during storage is provided. The dispensing device (12) 

is easily removable from the plastic container (11) when 
required for use, and may then be fitted back on to the 

outside of the container after use. This may be repeated 
many times. 
In this way, any risk of caking of the granular product 
caused by the presence of water on a wet dispensing device 

(i.e. after the device has been removed from the washing 
machine) is eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a package assembly containing a 
granular product, said package assembly comprising a 
reclosable container of thermoplastic material and a device 
for dispensing said granular product. In general such packages are often supplied with a 
measuring device such as a spoon with graduated marking to 
indicate volumes. Such a device may be used to pour the 
product into the dispensing compartment (such as a 
dispensing drawer) of a washing machine. Dispensing devices 
are also known; the purpose of these devices being to carry  
 
the granular product directly into the washing machine and 
to release it during the wash cycle itself. A package for storing and dispensing granular materials has 
been described in US5115966, May 26th 1992. A corner cap 
suitable for measuring quantities of the granular material 
is provided and may be clipped over the corner of the 
package. The package disclosed is made from paperboard, and 
the corner cap which is intended for use as a measuring or 
dosing device, is not suited for use as a dispensing device 
to deliver the granular product into the washing machine 
during the course of the wash cycle itself. Various dispensing devices have been suggested in the prior 
art including German Design Registration MR26344, published 
on September 30th, 1986. This design registration discloses 
a plastic canister for liquid detergents which has a recess 
in the middle of one side which can accommodate a dosing 
ball. However it has been common practice in the past to provide 
granular detergent products in a carton and to encourage 
the consumer to store a dispensing device inside that 
carton along with the granular product. This has been the 
case for both paperboard packages, and more recently for 
plastic refillable containers. However, this can give rise 
to problems. The dispensing device is often still damp when 
it is removed from the washing machine at the end of a  
 
completed cycle. If this device is immediately placed 
inside the package with the granular product, then this 
dampness can easily cause caking of the product which is 
clearly undesirable. If the device is not immediately 
placed inside the package however, there is a risk that it 
easily becomes lost or damaged. The present invention offers a solution to this problem. 
The invention is concerned with plastic containers, which 
are suitable for refilling with product many times. A means 
for fitting a dispensing device to the outside of the 
plastic container in such a way that it

<CLAIMS>
A package assembly (10) containing a granular product, 
said package assembly comprising a reclosable container 

(11) of thermoplastic material having an internal volume 
and an external surface; a device (12) for dispensing said 

granular product; and a means for the releasable attachment 
of said dispensing device (12) to the external surface of 

said container (11), wherein the internal volume of said 
container (11) is not in direct communication with 

releasably attached dispensing device (12) when the 
container is closed. 
A package assembly according to claim 1, wherein said 
dispensing device (12) comprises a body (13), said body 

having at least one opening (14), said opening allowing for 
a quantity of granular laundry detergent required for one 

washing cycle of an automatic washing machine to be 
admitted to the body (13) and to release said granular 

laundry detergent from said body (13) directly into the 
drum of the automatic washing machine during the washing 

cycle. 
A package assembly according to claim 2 wherein said 
means for releasable attachment comprises one projection, 

or a plurality of projections (124) on the external surface 
of said container (11) which engage in an opening (14) of 

said dispensing device (12). 
A package assembly according to claim 2 wherein said 
means for releasable attachment comprises a recess or 

cavity (125) in said external surface of said container 
(11), wherein said body (13) of said dispensing device (12) 

may be wholly or partly retained within said recess or 
cavity (125) by frictional interference between said 

container (11) and said dispensing device (12). 
A package assembly according to claim 1 wherein said 
reclosable container (11) comprises side walls (20), a 

bottom surface (21) and a top surface (22) defining an 
internal volume, wherein at least a substantial part of 

said top surface (22) is a removable lid (126) allowing 
access to the contents of said container (11). 
A package assembly according to claim 5 wherein said 
removable lid (126) is connected to said reclosable 

container (11) by means of a hinge device (123), said hinge 
device being located adjacent to, and parallel with, part 

of said side wall (20). 
A package assembly according to either of claims 5 or 6 
wherein said hinge device (123) is at least as long as the 

adjacent, parallel side wall (20). 
A package assembly according to any of claims 5 to 7 
wherein said means for releasable attachment of the 

dispensing device (12) to the container (11) is present on 
said lid (126). 
A package assembly according to any of claims 5 to 8 
wherein said dispensing device (12) comprises a body (13) 

having at least one opening (14), said means for releasable 
attachment comprising one, or a plurality of more 

projections (124) on the external surface of said container
