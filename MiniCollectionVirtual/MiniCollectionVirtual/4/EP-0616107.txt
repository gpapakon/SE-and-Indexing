<ABSTRACT>
2.1 A butt connection in the form of a corner connection or T-connection is intended to be configured such that the reinforcement mouldings for the alignment of the butt joints can be inserted into the respective corner region or butt-joint region subsequently, i.e. after connection by means of the profile connectors. Furthermore, there is to be the possibility of sealing the butt-joint region subsequently by sealing means. 2.2 The reinforcement moulding (24) of the butt connection according to the invention is an elastically deformable sheet-metal or plastic moulding which is supported under stress on the inner-side profile webs (18, 20, 21) which define the respective stop (12). The reinforcement moulding (24) can be inserted subsequently into the inner corner or outer corner. For this purpose, it is also not necessary for the grooves to be undercut. In the case of the corresponding design of the reinforcement moulding (24) with bores (28, 29), a sealing composition can be subsequently injected into the butt-joint region by means of a cartridge. 2.3 The butt connection according to the invention can be used particularly for windows and doors produced from interconnected aluminium profiles.

<CLAIMS>
A butt connection in the form of a corner or T-connection between 
profile portions (22, 23) which are disposed at an angle relative to each 

other and which are each provided with at least one respective outer limb 
forming an abutment (12), which profile portions are connected by means of 

profile connectors (27) engaging therein, forming a butt joint, and in 
which a shaped stiffening portion (24) which bridges over the butt joint in 

the inside thereof is fixed in the corner region, wherein the shaped 
stiffening portion (24) is elastically deformable and is supported under 

stress against the inside profile limbs (18, 20, 21) defining the 
respective abutment, characterised in that all profile portions are in the 

form of hollow profile portions (22, 23), the thickness of the shaped 
stiffening portion (24) is relatively small relative to the limbs of the 

profile portions (22, 23), each shaped stiffening portion (24) is in the 
form of an elastically deformable shaped sheet metal or plastics portion 

which is elastically deformable and which has a main body (30) of angular 
cross-section and angled spring plates (31, 32; 35, 36 and 33, 34; 37, 38) 

are provided both at the one and the other of the angular ends, wherein the 
angle between the surfaces of the angular main body (30) and t
he plates 
(31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38) is an obtuse angle, wherein the spring 

plates (33, 34, 35, 36) engage behind a T-shaped groove-defining limb (18) 
and the other resilient plates (33, 34 and 37, 38) engage behind a limb (20 

and 21 respectively) defining a water channel. 
A butt connection according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
limbs (20, 21) defining a water channel are respectively displaced towards 

the other limb relative to the insulating limbs (15, 16) which determine 
the profile channel depth, wherein said displacement preferably corresponds 

to the thickness of the limbs of the hollow profile portions (22, 23). 
A butt connection in the form of a T-connection according to claim 1 
characterised in that the middle region of each main body (30) has a 

constriction engaging over limbs forming a seal-receiving groove.  
 
A butt connection according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
angle included by the surfaces of the angular main body (30) is just over 

90Â°. 
A butt connection according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that each shaped stiffening portion (24) is provided with 

at least one bore (28, 29) for the injection of a sealing material into the 
connecting region.
