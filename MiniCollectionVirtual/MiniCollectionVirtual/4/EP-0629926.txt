<ABSTRACT>
An image reading apparatus includes a first reading 
element for receiving visible light in reflected light 

from a color document and reading image data corresponding 
to the visible light as electric signals, and a second 

reading element for receiving infrared light in reflected 
light from the color document and reading image data 

corresponding to the infrared light as electric signals. 
The image reading apparatus thus reads the image data not 

only from the visible light but also from the infrared 
light. Consequently, the image reading apparatus is 

capable of reading a special distinguishing pattern of 
copy-prohibited printed matter printed with special ink, 

such as infrared absorbing ink, as well as ordinary image 
data, and thereby preventing counterfeiting of 

copy-prohibited printed matter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processor
such as a digital full-color copying machine and a full-color
scanner incorporating an image reading apparatus
which reads an image on a color document by converting
image data of the color document into electric signals.Some of conventional image reading apparatuses,
which are incorporated into an image processor such as a
copying machine and read an image on a document by
converting the image data of the document into electric
signals, are 
capable of reading an image on a color document. As
illustrated in Fig. 15, such an image reading apparatus
includes a document platen 171 on which a color document M
is placed, a lamp unit 172 for applying light to the color
document M on the document platen 171, mirrors 173, an
infrared-light cut-off filter 174, an imaging lens 175,
and a reading element 176 for reading a color document.
When reflected light from the color document M falls onto
the reading element 176 through the mirrors 173, the
infrared-light cut-off filter 174 and the imaging lens
175, the image data of the color document M is converted
into electric signals and an image on the color document M
is read.The reflected light from the color document M is
composed of visible light and infrared light. The
infrared light is cut off by the infrared-light cut-off
filter 174. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 16, only the
visible light including blue light B, green light G and
red light R falls onto the reading element 176.The reading element 176 has three lines of light
receiving sections 180, 181 and 182 including filter
members 177, 178 and 179, respectively. Each of the
filter members 177, 178 and 179 selectively transmits blue
light B, green light G or red light R. The reading
element 176 reads the image data of the color document M 
by converting the visible light (the blue light B, green
light G and red light R) from the color document M into
electric signals.The light
receiving sections 180, 181 and 182 are sensitive not only
to visible light but also to infrared light.Thus, in an image reading apparatus capable of
reading a color document, the infrared-light cut-off
filter 174 is disposed in front of the imaging lens 175 as
described above or an infrared-light cut-off film, not
shown, is deposited on the imaging lens 175 so as to
accurately read the image on the color document M from the
visible light from the color document M. As disclosed in
Japanese Publication for Unexamined Patent Application No.
