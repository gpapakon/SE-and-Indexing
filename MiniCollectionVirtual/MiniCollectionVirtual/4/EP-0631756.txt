<ABSTRACT>
A spectrophotometric apparatus can be used for non-invasively 
measuring an activity in a body organ. 

Typically an optical fiber bundle (5) transmits light 
generated by a plurality of lasers (3) to the surface of 

the body (4). The light penetrates the body (4) into the 
organ. A light collector (600) collects the light as it 

emerges from the body (4) at a position several centimeters 
from the point of irradiation at the body surface (4). The 

light collector (600) is typically integrated with the 
optical fiber bundle (5) in a mountable support structure 

(12) for mounting on the body (4) while maintaining a fixed 
distance between the optical fiber bundle (5) and the light 

collector (600). Improved performance is achieved by 
having the light receiving surface (60) of the light 

collector elongate and arranged so that its smaller width 
dimension (W) extends in the direction towards the point of 

initiation and its longest length dimension (L) is substantially 
tangential to an imaginary circle centered on the 

point of irradiation. For example, the length (L) is 10 mm 
and the width (W) is 2 mm to 3 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
non-invasively monitoring a selected activity in an object, 
and more particularly to an apparatus for non-invasively 
monitoring metabolism, blood flow, blood volume, hemoglobin 
content of blood, and the like of an in vivo organ such as 
the brain. Many methods of irradiating an object with certain 
wavelength light and measuring the amount of light reflected 
or absorbed by the object to accurately analyze 
characteristics of the object are well known in the art. For 
example, oximeters have been used to measure the oxygenated 
fraction of hemoglobin in blood circulating in the body. A 
thin body part, such as an earlobe, a finger tip, or nose 
tip, is irradiated and the absorption of light after 
transmitting through or reflecting from the blood is 
measured. Recent advances in technology have produced 
devices such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,281,645 for 
measuring changes in blood volume, the oxygenation state of 
hemoglobin, and the rate of blood flow in the brain, heart, 
kidney, other organs, in limbs, or other parts of a human or 
animal body characteristics by measuring the amount of light 
these components absorb. Such devices allow non-invasive, 
continuous, bedside monitoring of blood volume in tissue 
under investigation and blood oxygen levels, and for 
intermittent monitoring of blood flow rate, particularly in 
the head, as determined by relative levels of oxidized 
hemoglobin, HbO2 and reduced hemoglobin, Hb.  
 A conventional system for measuring amount of 
disoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood flowing in the brain as 
a function of absorption of 760 nm wavelength light is shown 
in Fig. 1A. The system includes a light irradiating optical-fiber 
bundle 5 and a light collecting optical-fiber bundle 
6. One end of the light irradiating optical-fiber bundle 5 
is optically connected to a light source 3. The other end 
surface of the light irradiating optical-fiber bundle 5 
(which will be referred to as a "light irradiating surface 
50," hereinafter) is affixed to the surface of the head 4 so 
as to define a light irradiating area Li of the head. One 
end of the light collecting optical-fiber bundle 6 is 
optically connected to a photomultiplier 7. The other end 
surface of the light collecting optical-fiber bundle 6 (which 
will be referred to as a "light collecting surface 60," 
hereinafter) so as to define a light collecting area Lo of 
the head. The light irradiating area Li and the light 
collecting area Lo are separated by a
