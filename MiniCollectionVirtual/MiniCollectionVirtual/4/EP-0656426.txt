<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a new crystalline sugar 
product and method of making same which includes forming a 

bi-dimensionally stabilized sugar crystalline frame from 
an outer portion of an amor
phous shearform sugar mass, 
and, subsequently, converting the remaining portion of the 

mass to a substantially completely crystalline structure 
which retains the cross-sectional dimension of the sugar 

crystalline frame. The present invention also includes 
co-crystallizing an additive, especially a bio-affecting 

additive, during the process to provide a co-crystallized 
product. The structure of the crystallized product can

capillary action in the space created within the structure 

during the conversion from amorphous mass to crystalline 
structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
preparing crystalline sugar which provides unique 
structure and controlled crystal size, and the product 
resulting therefrom. Crystallization is one of the oldest industrial 
chemical transformation processes known. Vast quantities 
of crystalline substances are produced for commercial 
purposes, e.g., in excess of 100 x 10⁶ metric tons per 
year. One of the most common products prepared by 
crystallization is sugar. Crystallization of sugar is complex. The growth of 
crystals involves simultaneous transfer of heat and mass 
in a multi-phase, multi-component system. While the coexistence 
of these conditions alone present complex 
control problems, fluid and particle mechanics and 
thermodynamic instability create further complications. Conventional wisdom in the science of sugars teaches 
crystallization by supersaturation. Supersaturation 
requires removal of water. Cooling, evaporating, and 
precipitating are used. Manufacturing procedures for 
crystallizing sugar are heat and energy intensive. 
Moreover, nucleation of sugar crystals during 
supersaturation is relatively uncontrollable. 
Consequently, the size and shape of the resulting crystals 
are unpredictable. The drawbacks of known sugar manufacturing procedures 
are especially manifested when preparing sugar having 
reduced-size crystals. Reduced-size crystalline sugar 
product is referred to herein as microcrystals.  
 
Individual particles of microcrystalline product are no 
greater than 50 µm. For example, one method of manufacturing reduced-size 
crystals involves grinding and sieving crystalline sugar. 
Grinding is energy intensive. Moreover, fracturing sugar 
results in a wide distribution of ground sugar crystals. 
The large crystals must be reground and sieved. Much of 
the product is lost as fines. Thus, grinding and sieving 
is expensive and inefficient. U.S. Patent No. 3,981,739 to Dmitrovsky, et al. 
discloses preparation of crystalline sugar from solution 
by 1) concentrating a solute in the presence of seed 
crystals added thereto, followed by 2) further removal of 
solvent through heating and evaporation of the stream 
resulting from the first stage concentration. This energy 
intensive procedure produces sugar crystals having an 
average size in the range of 325-425 microns. The 
Dmitrovsky, et al. '739 disclosure is a solution process 
which relies on nucleation by addition of seed crystals 
while concentrating by high heat and vacuum evaporation. 
The same procedure is disclosed
