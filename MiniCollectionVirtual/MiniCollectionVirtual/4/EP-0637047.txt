<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electron tube cathode comprising a hollow cylindrical structure of thermo-emissive wires which is mounted between two conducting supports (5,6). The two supports (5,6) are firmly mechanically attached to one another. In order to avoid deformation of the cathode during ignition and extinguishing of heating, use is made of at least one spring (53) integrated with one of the supports and placed in proximity to the thermo-emissive wires. The spring is made of a material which has, at ambient temperature, elastic properties which are less good or equal to that which it has at a temperature greater than ambient temperature. Application: grid electron tubes.

switch-off of heating having a hollow cylindrical 

structure, comprising thermoemissive wires, mounted 
between two conductive supports (5,6), the supports (5,6) 

being mechanically fixed to each other, and at least one 
spring (53,85) integrated with one of the supports (5) to 

neutralize the tensile and compressive stresses in the 
wires, the spring (33) being situated in proximity to the 

thermoemissive wires, characterized in that the spring 
(53) is made of a non-metallic material possessing a

(52) on one side and being fixed on the other side to the 

plate (51). 
Electron tube cathode according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the spring (53) is 

a hollow cylinder comprising, crosswise, an alternating 
succession of portions comprising at least one spring
