<ABSTRACT>
A friction clutch (440) for use with a 360 degree dual pivot point hinge (106) permits rotation about but one pivot point axis (444 or 445) at a time to assure proper 180 degree operation of each hinge member (411, 413 and 412, 414) associated with the hinge (106), thereby eliminating the misalignment problems typically experienced by dual pivot point hinges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to hinges, and particularly,
to dual pivot point hinges. Specifically, the present invention relates to a
clutch mechanism for use with a dual pivot point hinge adapted for use
with electronic housing assemblies and the like.Electronic housing assemblies for enclosing portable computing
and/or communicating devices such as portable computers, palm-top
computers, electronic notebooks, portable personal organizers, portable
intelligent communicators (PICs) and the like are known. Typically, such
enclosures employ a lid or cover which is pivotally connected by a hinge or
an equivalent mechanical mechanism to a device base or body. A display
screen, integral to the cover, may be employed such that when the cover is
closed, the display screen is protected from damage.In most instances, the cover can only pivot to a limited extent (i.e.,
90° to about 180°). As a result, known palm-top and lap-top computers and
communicators typically provide a very limited number of screen or
display orientations and generally offer the user only one or two ways of
orienting the display screen.WO-A-9301700 describes a lap-top computer with a hinged display.
The hinge can consist of a pivot plate comprising a pair of pivot pins at
each end. One of each pair of pivot pins may be engaged by an 'inboard'
shaft, which itself rotates inside an 'outboard' shaft. A clutch spring may
control the resistance to rotation of the inboard shaft within the outboard
shaft. During opening and closing, the display may rotate about one of the
pivot pins prior to rotating about the other.The present invention relates to a friction clutch according to claim 7 and to a
corresponding electronic assembly enclosure according to claim 1.Briefly described, the present invention concerns a friction clutch for use
with a dual pivot point hinge. The clutch comprises a support structure
having two parallel end flanges, each end flange has a pair of apertures 
for accepting first and second clutch axles. The parallel end flanges are
connected by a center beam disposed between the pair of apertures. The
center beam employs spring anchors which establish spring member
position and prevent spring member rotation. Each spring member has a
loop that determines a spring wrap direction.During assembly, the first clutch axle is inserted into the first
aperture of the first end flange, through the loop of the first spring member
and through the first aperture of the second end flange. Likewise, the
second clutch axle is

<CLAIMS>
An electronic assembly enclosure comprising:

a body (102);
a cover (104);
hinging means (106) for hinging said cover to said body such that said cover is
movable relative to said body and locatable in a plurality of positions over

substantially the whole range from 0 to 360 degrees relative to said body, said
hinging means including first and second hinge axles (430) for permitting said

cover to move relative to said body about a first and a second pivot axis; and
a friction clutch (440), having first and second clutch axles (444, 445) coupled

to the first and second hinge axles for receiving torque from the first and second
hinge axles during rotation of the cover relative to the body, said friction clutch

further comprising first and second spring members (447, 448) wrapped
around and in frictional contact with the first and second clutch axles for

exerting a braking friction upon the first and second clutch axles in response to
the torque exerted upon the clutch axles, said braking friction varying

according to the direction of relative rotation between each clutch axle and its
spring member so as to permit said cover to move relative to said body about

but one pivot axis at a time.
The electronic assembly enclosure of claim 1 wherein the friction clutch
further comprises an H-shaped support structure having two parallel end

flanges (442), each end flange having a pair of apertures (449) for accepting a
second end of the first and the second clutch axles, the parallel end flanges

being connected by a center beam (443) disposed between the pair of
apertures, the center beam having spring anchoring means (501,502). 
The electronic assembly enclosure of claim 1 further comprising detachable
hinge members, each member having end caps and a center section for

coupling the first and second parallel and hollow hinge axle members of the
body to the first and second parallel and hollow hinge axle members of the

cover to form a 360 degree dual pivot point hinge having first and second pivot
point axes defined by the parallel and hollow hinge axle members of the body

and the cover, for permitting the cover to rotate relative to the body about the
first and the second pivot point axes through a plurality of positions from 0 to

360 degrees relative to the body.
The electronic assembly enclosure of claim 3 wherein the first hollow hinge
axle member of the cover and the first hollow hinge axle member of the body

are fashioned to define a hollow channel for accepting electrical conductors
which provide an electrical connection between the body and the cover.
The electronic assembly enclosure of claim 3 wherein the second hollow
hinge axle member of the cover and the second hollow hinge axle member of the

body are fashioned to comprise means for transferring torque to the friction
clutch in response to movement of the cover relative to the body.
The electronic assembly enclosure of claim 1 wherein the hinging means
comprises a first hollow hinge axle member and a second hollow hinge axle

member fashioned to define a hollow channel for accepting electrical
conductors which provide an electrical connection between the body a
nd the
cover at a first end of the hinging means. 
A friction clutch having first (444) and second (445) clutch axles for use with
a dual pivot point hinge, said hinge having first and second hinge axles for

transferring torque to said first and second clutch axles, said friction clutch

a support structure (441) having first and second parallel end flanges (442),
each end flange having a pair of apertures (449) for accepting an end of said

first and said second clutch axles (444, 445), respectively, said first and second
parallel end flanges (442) being connected by a center beam (443) disposed

between said pair of apertures, said center beam (443) having spring anchoring
means (501, 502); and
first and second spring members (447, 448), anchored to the support structure

clutch axle (445) is inserted into the second aperture of the first end flange,

through the loop of said second spring member and through the second
aperture of the second end flange such that the first and second spring

members exert a braking friction upon the first and second clutch axles, in
response to torque exerted upon the axles by the hinge members, said braking
