<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in photographic 
apparatus - conventional photographic apparatus has been 
used, for instance, for photographing a personal photo to 
be stuck on an identification card, a passport or a name 
card. With such conventional photographic apparatus, a user 
sits on a chair provided at a specified location, and 
operates the apparatus according to an announced message or 
an instruction shown on an operation panel, thereby 
photographing an image of the user using a photographing 
camera on a photo-sensing material comprising a silver 
halogenide, and developing and printing using a developing 
solution and a printing solution. A first problem related to conventional photographic 
apparatus is that, where the apparatus is a type using a 
photo-sensing material containing a silver halogenide and 
a developing solution, a considerable length of time is 
required for developing and drying a photo, that is, for 
instance, more than 2 minutes for finishing the photo. In 
addition, processing solutions such as a developing 
solution and printing solution deteriorate as the 
photo-sensing material of silver halogenide is processed 
and the solutions are oxidized by atmospheric air. 
Consequently, the quality of a finished photo may sometimes 
not be satisfactory. In addition, a considerable amount of 
cost is required for managing processing solutions such as 
supplying of a developing solution and a printing solution. 
Furthermore, since processing solutions contain toxic 
substances, recovery and disposal of wasted solutions is 
costly. Hence, a novel photographic apparatus using a 
recording paper in substitute of a photo-sensing material  
 
of a silver halogenide is demanded, for recording a 
photographed image of a shooting object in order to create 
a certificate photo to be used in an identification card, 
a passport or a name card A new recording system proposed for this purpose is 
that a photographed image of a shooting body, using an 
electronic camera, is recorded on a recording paper, for 
example. With such a system in use, time required for 
finishing a photo can be reduced more than that with a 
recording system using a photo-sensing material of a silver 
halogenide. In addition, the quality of a finished photo is 
guaranteed to be higher than a specified level, while also 
reducing maintenance cost. A second problem would still exist even with such a 
new recording system; with a photographic apparatus used to 
take a picture for personal identification, such

unit, and 

   a control unit (50) for controlling the operation of 
the photographic apparatus. 
Photographic apparatus according to claim 1, in which 
a photographing operation unit (13) is provided for setting 

a recording condition of a photographed image and 
outputting a photographing instruction, and said control 

unit (50) controls said electronic camera (22) and said 
recording unit (29), according to said recording condition 

and said photographing instruction, as set in said 
photographing operation unit (13). 
Photographic apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 
2, in which said recording unit (29) is provided with a 

plurality of printers (30) for recording a photographed 
image of a shooting object stored in said image storage 

unit (28), and said control unit (50) monitors an operation 
state of said plurality of printers and selects an operable
