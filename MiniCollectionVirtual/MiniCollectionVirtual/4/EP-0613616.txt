<ABSTRACT>
The harvester according to the invention consists of a main chassis (4) mounted on rolling members (7, 8) and associated with means which allow it to be moved along the harvesting bed. This main chassis (4) carries a secondary chassis (6), called the collecting chassis. The collecting chassis (6) is fitted with a cutting blade (12) which is arranged substantially perpendicularly to the direction of advance (13) and which is driven in a reciprocating transverse movement, and an endless conveyor (16) arranged downstream of the cutting blade (12) over the entire working width. It also comprises means (18) for permanently adjusting the positioning of the collecting chassis (6) with respect to the ground, in order to correctly position the cutting blade (12) with respect to the base of the plant crop to be harvested. This harvester is particularly well-suited for harvesting lettuce of the lambs' lettuce variety on market gardening beds.

A salad harvester, of the type of corn, salad, for example, consisting of the
following elements:


a main chassis (4) mounted on rolling members (7, 8) and associated with means
enabling its movement along the harvest board (1),
a secondary chassis (6), so-called picking-up chassis, carried by the main chassis (4),
whereas the said picking-up chassis (6) is fitted with a cutting blade (12, 12') arranged

more or less perpendicular to the forward direction (13) and which is driven by an
alternate transversal movement,
an endless conveyor (16), comprising an endless belt (24) winding around a sabre (23,
27) at the level of its nose (22), just behind the cutting blade (12, 12') and on a

motorised drum (33) at the rear, and extending over the whole working length,
and means (18) for permanent position adjustment of the picking-up chassis (6) with
respect to the ground (1) for correct positioning of the cutting blade (12, 12') with

respect to the foot of the vegetable to be harvested.
A harvester according to claim 1, characterised in that it comprises a sabre (23)
composed of a winding circle or semi-circle (25) whose diameter ranges from 8 to 10

mm, associated with a stiffening flat (26) extending backwards.
A harvester according to any of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that it comprises a
sabre (27) composed of juxtaposed revolving circles (32) mounted on bearings (31)

interconnected with a stiffening profile (28) extending backwards.
A harvester according to any of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it comprises
a device (42) preventing side offset of the belt (24), active on the lower edge of the said

belt (24), just behind the end sabre (23, 27), whereas the said device (42) is made of an
idle stem (43) mounted on bearings, arranged more or less parallel to the said sabre (23,

27), over the whole length of the endless belt (24), whereby the position of the said stem
(43) is adjustable laterally, at the level of its bearings, along a direction more or less

perpendicular to the belt plane (24).
A harvester according to any of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that it comprises 
a motorised drum (33) fitted with side cheeks (34) shaped as disks or crowns, arranged

to guide the endless belt (24) and to force it to maintain a correct position, centred on
the secondary chassis (6).
A harvester according to any of the claims 1 to 5, characterised in that it comprises
an automatic tensioning system of the endless belt (24), whereas the said system

consists of a stiff frame (38) pivoting on the secondary chassis (6), whereas the said
frame (38) carries the lateral bearings of the motorised drum (33) and is controlled by an

elastic recall device (40) provided or pulling on the drum (33) in order to stretch the
belt (24).
A harvester according to any of the claims 1 to 6, characterised in that it comprises
a cutting blade (12, 12') whose leading border (20, 20') is sharp and which is fitted with

openings or orifices (46).
A harvester according to claim 7, characterised in that it comprises a cutting blade
(12, 12') whose border (21, 21') opposite the sharp edge (20, 20') looks like a comb

with a large number of longitudinal end openings (46).
A harvester according to any of the claims 7 or 8, characterised in that it comprises
a cutting blade (12') shaped as an arc of a circle or as a dyhedron.
A harvester according to any of the claims 1 to 9, characterised in that it
comprises a picking-up chassis (6) interconnected with the main chassis (4) via a joint

(9), at the rear, and via two lateral jacks (10) at the front.
A harvester according to any of the claims 1 to 10, characterised in that it
comprises at least one vertical slide (70), for guiding the picking-up chassis (6), in the

vicinity of the lateral jack(s) (10).
A harvester according to any of the claims 1 to 11, characterised in that it
comprises a main chassis (4) mounted on four wheels (7, 8) designed to operate on

either side of the harvest board, possibly in the lateral stock holes (3).
A harvester according to claim 12; characterised in that it comprises front wheels
(7), adjustable in height using a safety jack (75) connected to an upper and lower stop

system (74), connected to the lateral gauge jack (10) of the secondary chassis (6)
provided nearby.
A harvester according to any of the claims 1 to 13, characterised in that the
permanent adjustment means of the picking-up chassis (6) consist of one or several 

wheel-shaped detectors (48) provided just in front of the cutting blade (12, 12') and
operating on the harvest board, whereby the said detectors (48) are each associated with

a hydraulic slide distributor (54), in the form of a flow control valve, connected to the
jacks (10) which interlock the main chassis (4) and the picking-up chassis (6) at the

level of their front section.
A harvester according to claim 14, characterised in that it comprises two
detectors (48) each associated with a hydraulic slide distributor (54) each controlling

one of the lateral jacks (10).
A harvester according to any of the claims 14 or 15, characterised in that the
hydraulic slide distributors (54) associated with the detector(s) (48) are interconnected

with the picking-up chassis (6) and consist of a body (55) fitted with a pressure supply
(59) and a return output (60) connected to a pump (61) or to the hydraulic system of the

tractive unit, whereas the said supply (59) feeds in parallel one of the chambers (63) of
the related double-action jack (10), and the said output (60) feeds in parallel the other

chamber (65) of the said jack (10), whereas the body of the distributor (55) is fitted with
a slide (56) whose position is adjusted by the related detector (48), whereas the said

slide (56) connects the supply (59) and the output (60) of the body of the distributor (55)
and adjusts the flow rate in relation to its position.
