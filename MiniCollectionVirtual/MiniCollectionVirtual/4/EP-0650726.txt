<ABSTRACT>
A medicine for the treatment of tumor. The medicine 
contains 4-piperidino-piperidine or a physiologically 

acceptable salt thereof as the effective component. 
Although 4-piperidino-piperidine or a physiologically 

acceptable salt thereof do not exhibit tumor cell killing 
effect 
per se
, they suppress propagation of tumor cells, 
dissolve resistance of other antitumor drugs, and enhance 

the antitumor activity of antitumor drugs. Therefore, when 
the medicine according to the present invention is used in 

combination with other antitumor drugs, their inherent 
antitumor activity is enhanced. Since the dose of antitumor 

drugs which are to be used along with the medicine of the 
present invention can be reduced, adverse side effects are 

reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medicine for the
treatment of tumor, which is useful in the therapy of
various cancerous diseases.Antitumor agents which are used in the treatment of
cancerous diseases are generally accompanied by severe
adverse side effects, which impose restrictions on the
amount of the agents to be dosed. As a result, a problem
arises in that expected therapeutic effects cannot be
obtained. When a same antitumor drug is repeatedly
administered to a patient for a long time, another problem
occurs: tumor cells acquire tolerance against the antitumor
drug, hindering the expected therapeutic effect from being
exhibited. In order to solve these problems, conventional
regimens have employed a combined use of plural antitumor
agents.However, the above problems, i.e., restricted dosage,
adverse side effects, and drug resistance which are involved
in conventional antitumor drugs have not yet been fully
solved by the reliance on a combined use of plural antitumor
agents.The inventors of the present invention have 
investigated the action of wide-range substances and the
action exhibited when an antitumor drug is used in
combination with another drug, and as a result, have found
that 4-piperidino-piperidine or its physiologically
acceptable salts can suppress propagation of tumor cells,
dissolve resistance against other antitumor drugs, and, when
used in combination with other antitumor drugs, can enhance
the antitumor effect of such other antitumor drugs.4-Piperidino-piperidine is known as a metabolite of the antitumor
drug CPT-II (Chemical Abstracts, Vol.116,1992, 118h, corresp. to
Yakubutsu Dotai, 1991,6(1), 105-25) and it is used as a synthetic
intermediate in the preparation of antitumor medicaments (Derwent
Publications, World Patent Index, abstract number 88-202979,
corresp. to JP-A-63141964).Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide a medicine for the treatment of tumor, which solves
a problem of poor therapeutic effects due to the restricted
dosage of a drug for avoiding adverse side effects, as well
as resistance acquired by tumor cells occurring after a long
term dose of a drug.In one aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a medicine for the treatment of tumor which
comprises, as its effective component, 4-piperidino-piperidine
or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof.In another aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a medicine for the treatment of tumor, in which 4-piperidino-piperidine
or a physiologically acceptable salt 
thereof
