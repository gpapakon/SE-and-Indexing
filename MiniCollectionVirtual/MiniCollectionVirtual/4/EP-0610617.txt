<ABSTRACT>
An oil filtering device (1) for use in a swing-type 
power unit (8) of a motor bicycle (2) having a four-stroke-cycle 

engine (4) including a crank case (26), comprises an oil pan (12) for 
storing oil (11), an oil pump (18) for conveying the oil (11) in the 

oil pan (12) to engine portions such as a crank shaft (16) involving 
friction, a lubrication passage through which the oil (11) 

conveyed by the oil pump (18) is supplied to the engine portions 
involving friction, an oil strainer (22) provided in the 

lubrication passage (20) for first filtering the oil (11), and an oil 
filter (24) for further filtering the oil (11) which has been 

filtered by the oil strainer (22). The oil (11) to be fed to the 
crank shaft (16), for example, involving friction is conveyed by 

way of the oil strainer (22) and the oil filter (24) through the 
lubrication passage (20) before being supplied thereto. The oil 

strainer (22) and the oil filter (24) are arranged below and spaced 
apart from the crank shaft (16) and detachably provided on a 

surface of the crank case (26) composed of two halves. The 
swing-type power unit (8) is provided with a suspension arm (8a) 

having a suspension boss (29) to which the oil filter (24) is 
provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oil filtering 
device for a motor bicycle and, more specifically, to an 
oil filtering device for use in a swing-type power unit of 
a scooter having a four-stroke-cycle engine. Fig. 10 shows an engine 100 having a conventional 
oil filtering device 101 for a scooter. With this oil 
filtering device 101, a lubricating oil 102, the flow of 
which is indicated by arrows in an oil pan, is conveyed to 
a crank shaft 105 by an oil pump 104 immediately after any 
relatively large particles of dirt have been filtered out 
therefrom by an oil strainer 103, serving as a first 
filtering section, provided on the lower surface of the 
engine 100. Thereafter, the oil is conveyed to portions of 
the engine 100 at which a friction occurs, for example, a 
connecting rod 107 and a cylinder head 108, through a 
centrifugal oil filter 106 provided on the crank shaft 105 
and serving as a second filtering section. The mounting of 
the oil strainer 103, which is detachably provided on the 
lower surface of the engine 100, is rather troublesome. 
Further, since the centrifugal oil filter 106 is formed on 
the crank shaft 105, its mounting is also rather 
troublesome. Further, the crank shaft 105, on which the  
 
centrifugal oil filter 106 is provided, is subjected to 
strong vibrations during travelling, so that the oil 102 
supplied to the crank shaft 105 is liable to be mixed with 
air, which results in that the lubricating performance of 
the lubricating oil 102 is liable to deteriorate. In addition, since the centrifugal oil filter 106 
is situated above and spaced apart from the oil strainer 
103, the load on the oil pump 104 due to the weight of 
dust, dirt, etc. which has not been filtered out by the oil 
strainer 103 is considerably large, which also is not 
desirable from the viewpoint of the lubricating performance 
of the lubricating oil 102. An object of the present invention is to 
substantially eliminate defects or drawbacks encountered in 
the prior art and to provide an oil filtering device for a 
scooter capable of facilitating the replacement of the 
filtering sections for filtering lubricating oil, such as 
the strainer and improving the durability of the crank 
shaft by making the lubricating function of the oil less 
subject to deterioration. This and other objects of the present invention 
can be achieved by providing an oil filtering device for 
use in a swing-type power unit of a motor bicycle having a 
four-stroke-cycle engine including a crank case, the oil
