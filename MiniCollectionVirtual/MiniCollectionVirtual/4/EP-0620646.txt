<ABSTRACT>
Static current consumption in a low-side output driver stage is 
eliminated by employing a switch (M5) in series with a current 

generator (J2) that is employed for controlling the discharge process of 

the driving node (gate) of the output power transistor (P
w
) and 
by controlling the switch (M5) with the voltage that is present on the 

driving node of the output power transistor (P
w
).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to output power 
stages employing a power switch for connecting 
to a ground node a load and wherein static 
power consumption within the driving circuit is 
substantially eliminated. A circuit for switchingly connecting to ground 
(low-side driver) an external load employing a 
power switch has a basic diagram as shown in 
Fig. 1. Commonly the power switch Pw is a transistor 
and often an integrated DMOS transistor 
that notably offers definite advantages over a bipolar 
junction transistor. The integrated transistor 
structure intrinsically contains a junction 
(diode) Dr through which, in case of 
reactive loads, transient currents may recirculate. 
The power transistor Pw constitutes the 
output stage and is controlled by a driving circuit 
which determines a state of conduction or 
of nonconduction of the transistor, according 
to a certain "duty cycle" (in most applications). In this way, an output signal having an 
amplitude comprised between Vl=Rdson*Idand Vh=H.V. 
is produced, where H.V. is the supply voltage 
to which the external load is connected, Rdson 
is the saturation resistance of the power 
transistor Pw and Id is the current through the 
load. In order to ensure a low voltage drop 
through the power transistor Pw when it is 
conducting, and therefore a low power dissipation, 
it is necessary to minimize the Rdson value. 
This is achieved by driving the power transistor 
with a (gate) voltage that is higher  
 
than the voltage that is necessary for switching-on the 
transistor. Normally, for a DMOS transistor such an 
overdrive voltage may reach about 10V, i.e. Vgs=10V, 
that is it may be equal to the supply voltage Vcc of 
the control circuit. Moreover, the output signal (OUT) is often required 
to have certain slew-rate characteristics (Tf and Tr) 
and delays (Tphl and Tplh), as referred to the control 
signal (IN), controlled and equal to each other, as 
depicted in Fig. 2. On the other hand, in order to switch-on the power 
transistor Pw, it is necessary to charge the capacitance 
of the driving node (gate node) up to a voltage 
that is higher than the threshold voltage Vth of 
the transistor. If, during a switch-on phase, driving 
is effected through a constant current generator I1 
(Fig. 1), the gate voltage will have a diagram versus 
time as the one depicted in Fig. 3. Three different 
zones of operation of the power transistor may be 
distinguished, as determined by the actual input 
capacitance that varies from zone to zone. In a first zone I of
