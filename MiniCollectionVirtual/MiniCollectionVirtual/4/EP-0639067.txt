<ABSTRACT>
Gas, gaseous precursors and perfluorocarbons are presented as novel potentiators for ultrasonic hyper-thermia. The gas, gaseous precursors and perfluorocarbons which may be administered into the vasculature, interstitially or into any body cavity are designed to accumulate in cancerous and diseased tissues. When therapeutic ultrasonic energy is applied to the diseased region heating is increased because of the greater effectiveness of sound energy absorption caused by these agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of
perfluorocarbons for the preparation
of hyperthermia potentiators for use in combination with
ultrasound to facilitate the selective heating of the
tissues and fluids.The usefulness of heat to treat various inflammatory
and arthritic conditions has long been known. The use of
ultrasound to generate such heat for these as well as other
therapeutic purposes, such as in, for example, the treatment
of tumors has, however, been a fairly recent development.Where the treatment of inflammation and arthritis
is concerned, the use of the ultrasound induced heat serves
to increase blood flow to the affected regions, resulting in
various beneficial effects. Moreover, when ultrasonic energy 
is delivered to a tumor, the temperature of the tumorous
tissue rises, generally at a higher rate than in normal
tissue. As this temperature reaches above about 43°C, the
tumorous cells begin to die and, if all goes well, the tumor
eventually disappears. Ultrasound induced heat treatment of
biological tissues and fluids is known in the art as
hyperthermic ultrasound.The non-invasive nature of the hyperthermia
ultrasound technique is one of its benefits. Nonetheless, in
employing hyperthermic ultrasound, certain precautions must
be taken. Specifically, one must be careful to focus the
ultrasound energy on only the areas to be treated, in an
attempt to avoid heat-induced damage to the surrounding, non-targeted,
tissues. In the treatment of tumors, for example,
when temperatures exceeding about 43°C are reached, damage to
the surrounding normal tissue is of particular concern. This
concern with over heating the non-target tissues thus places
limits on the use of hyperthermic ultrasound. Such
therapeutic treatments would clearly be more effective and
more widely employed if a way of targeting the desired
tissues and fluids, and of maximizing the heat generated in
those targeted tissues, could be devised.The present invention is directed toward improving
the effectiveness and utility of hyperthermic ultrasound by
providing agents capable of promoting the selective heating
of targeted tissues and body fluids. WO93/05819, which forms part of the state of the art by virtue of Article 54(3)
EPC, describes gaseous ultrasound contrast media comprising microbubbles of gases that
have life spans in solution that are long enough to enable in vivo imaging. The long life
spans in solution are achieved by selection of suitable gases for forming the microbubbles.US-A-4865836 describes the use of
