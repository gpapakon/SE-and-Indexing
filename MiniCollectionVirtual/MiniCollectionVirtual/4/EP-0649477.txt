<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a direct current electric furnace for melting a ferrous raw material such as scrap iron, comprising a vessel (1) closed by a removable cover (13), at least one consumable electrode (5) passing through at least one aperture (16) in the cover (13), at least one stationary electrode (50) placed at the bottom (2) of the vessel (1), and at least one direct current source, said vessel (1) being bounded by a bottom (2) shaped as a basin (21) and a side wall (12). According to this invention, the height (H1) and cross-section (S1) of the basin (21) are determined according to the operating conditions so that the basin (1) may contain a prescribed quantity of molten metal, with the height (H2) of the side wall (12) of the vessel (1) being such that the vessel (1) is capable of containing a sufficient load of scrap iron (7) to provide, in a single melting operation, said prescribed quantity of molten metal.

Direct current electric furnace for the melting of a
ferrous raw material, such as scrap iron, comprising a

vessel (1) closed in its upper region by a removable
cover (13) for the introduction of a charge (7) of

material to be melted, at least one consumable electrode
(5) which is placed in position substantially in the axis

of the vessel (1) and is mounted to slide vertically so
as to be lowered into the interior of the vessel (1),

passing through at least one opening (16) in the cover
(13), at least one stationary electrode (50) placed in

position in the bottom (2) of the vessel (1), and at
least one source of direct current having two poles

connected, respectively, to the consumable electrode (5)
and the stationary electrode (50), said vessel comprising

a bottom (2) covered by a bed plate of refractory
material and forming a basin (21) having a raised edge

(22) and a height (H1) and a maximum cross-section (S1),
and a lateral wall (12) placed in position substantially

in the extension of the edge (22) of the basin (21) and
defining a cylindrical space having a cross-section (S2)

which is substantially equal to the maximum cross-section
(S1) of the basin (21), the height (H1) and the cross-section

(S1) of the basin (21) being determined according
to the making conditions so that the capacity of the

basin (21) corresponds to a prescribed quantity of the
molten metal to cast in an alone casting operation,

characterized by the fact that the lateral wall (12) of
the vessel (1) extends to a height (H2) such that the

vessel (1) is liable to contain a sufficient charge of
scrap iron (7) to produce in a single melting operation

said prescribed quantity of molten metal corresponding to
the maximum capacity of the basin (21). 
Electric furnace according to claim 1, characterized
by the fact that the height (H2) of the lateral wall (12)

of the vessel (1) is such that the volume defined by said
lateral wall (12) is between six and twelve times the

capacity of the basin (21) which capacity corresponds to
the prescribed quantity of molten metal.
Electric furnace according to claim 1, characterized
by the fact that it is associated with a single

consumable electrode which penetrates into the furnace
with a length (L) starting from the cover, the ratio of

said length (L) to the diameter of the electrode not
exceeding a factor of 10.
Electric furnace according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized by the fact that the

vessel (1) of the furnace is associated with additional
heating means for the preheating of the charge within the

interior of the vessel (1).
Electric furnace according to claim 4, characterized
by the fact that the additional heating means comprise at

least one burner (4) which opens into the interior of the
vessel (1) at the bottom of the lateral wall (12).
Electric furnace according to any one of claims 4
and 5, characterized by the fact that the additional

heating means comprise at least one pipe for the
injection of hot gas which opens up into the interior of

the vessel (1) immediately above the junction of the
lateral wall (12) and the bottom (2).
Electric furnace according to claim 6, characterized
by the fact that the pipe for the injection of hot gas is

connected to a combustion chamber which is provided with
a burner and is supplied with fuel gas.
