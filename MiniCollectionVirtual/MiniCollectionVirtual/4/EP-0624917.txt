<ABSTRACT>
An antenna system comprises a main antenna (11) for use of 
transmission and reception and a dedicated sub-antenna for use 

of reception. The antenna beam of the antenna system is scanned 
in the direction of a beam width to be compressed. Both received 

signals of the main antenna and the sub-antenna are fed to a 
signal processing circuit (14) and a multiplying circuit (14), and 

converted to power signals and then multiplied by each other. In 
this processing, only if the cosine value corresponding to the 

phase difference between the received power signals of the main 
antenna and the sub-antenna is positive, is the multiplication 

between the received power signals carried out and the 
result further multiplied by the cosine value. The 

obtained signal is then output as a final output signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of performing
beam compression of radar antenna patterns, which can provide
better performance in the beam compression process of an
antenna pattern of a radar utilizing the multiplicative array
principle.In general, the beam width is one of the indexes representing the
performance of an antenna pattern of a receiving antenna or
other type antennas. A narrower beam width of an antenna
pattern will give a better performance. However, there is a
relationship of inverse proportion between the beam width and the
size (length) of an antenna. Therefore, if the beam width is
reduced, then the size of the antenna will be increased.
Conversely, if the dimension of the antenna is reduced, then
the beam width will be broadened.For example, in an antenna for a radar system, if it is
desired to double the ability or the resolution to discriminate
objects, it is required to halve the beam width and thus it is
required to double the size of the antenna. The doubling of the 
size leads to not only a larger occupied region but also various
disadvantages such as an increase in the weight of the antenna
and in the size of a structure for supporting the antenna.
Conversely, if the size of an antenna is halved, then the beam
width will be doubled and the discrimination ability will be
degraded by a factor of two.It is well known that there is such a conflicting
relationship between the beam width and the size of an antenna.
In most cases, an actual antenna has a limitation in the region
it can occupy. Therefore, under these limited conditions, a
certain degree of compromise associated with the beam width has
to be made.One known beam compression technique to alleviate the
above-described problems is to reduce the beam width by means
of multiplication of received signals of a plurality of
antennas according to the multiplicative array principle.
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings is a schematic diagram illustrating
the configuration of a radar system which can perform beam compression in
such a manner described above. In this figure, reference numeral 101
designates a main antenna such as an array antenna comprising
a plurality of radiation elements which are equally spaced
along a straight line. Reference numeral 102 designates a
sub-antenna disposed apart from the main antenna 101 in the
X-direction which is the direction of the beam-width to be
reduced. Reference numeral 103 designates a transmission 
circuit which generates transmission power, which is in turn
fed to the main
