<ABSTRACT>
An integrable transceiver for relatively high frequencies with a receiving branch mixer (1), which multiplies a received signal (2) and a carrier frequency signal (3) by one another, with a controlled first intermediate-frequency oscillator (5), which can be switched off by a switching signal (8) and the frequency range of which can be switched by a first range control signal (8), with a demodulator which follows the receiving branch mixer (1) and which is also supplied with the output signal of the first intermediate-frequency oscillator (5) directly and phase-shifted by 90@ and which outputs an output signal (17), with a phase detector device (7) which follows the first intermediate-frequency oscillator (5) and, in turn, controls the latter and the frequency range of which can be switched by a second range control signal (10), with a second controlled intermediate-frequency oscillator (11) which is connected in parallel with the first intermediate-frequency oscillator (5) and which can be switched on by the switching control signal (9), with a transmitting branch mixer (13), one input of which is connected to the outputs of the first and second intermediate-frequency oscillator (5, 11), and to the other input of which the carrier frequency signal (3) is applied, and with a modulator (14) which follows the transmitting branch mixer (13) and which is also supplied with an input signal (15) and which outputs a transmitting signal (16).

Transmitter/receiver arrangement having a
receiving path mixer (1) which multiplies a received

signal (2) and a carrier frequency signal (3) by one
another, having a controlled, first intermediate

frequency oscillator (5) which can be switched off by a
switching control signal (9) and whose frequency band

can be changed by a first band control signal (8),
having a demodulator which is connected downstream of

the receiving path mixer (1) and to which, in addition,
the output signal from the first intermediate frequency

oscillator (5) is supplied both directly and
phase-shifted through 90Â° and which emits an output

signal (17), having a controlled, second intermediate
frequency oscillator (11) which is connected in

parallel with the first intermediate frequency
oscillator (5) and can be switched on by the switching

control signal (9), having a phase detector device (7)
which is connected downstream of the first and the

second intermediate frequency oscillator (5, 11),
controls the latter and whose frequency band can be

changed by a second band control signal (10), having a
transmission path mixer (13) one of whose inputs is

connected to the outputs of the first and of the second
intermediate frequency oscillator (5, 11) and to whose

other input the carrier frequency signal (3) is
applied, and having a modulator (14) which is connected

downstream of the transmission path mixer (13), emits a 
transmission signal (16) and to which an input signal

(15) is additionally supplied.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the first intermediate frequency oscillator (5)

is switched on and the second intermediate frequency
oscillator (11) is switched off, and in that the first

intermediate frequency oscillator (5) and the phase
detection device (7) are switched to the same frequency

band.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the first intermediate frequency oscillator (5)

is switched on and in that the first intermediate
frequency oscillator (5) and the phase detection device

(7) are changed between two frequency bands for the
transmission mode and reception mode.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that, in the transmission mode, the first

intermediate frequency oscillator (5) is switched off
and the second intermediate frequency oscillator (11)

is switched on, in that, in the reception mode, the
second intermediate frequency oscillator (11) is

switched off and the first intermediate frequency
oscillator (5) is switched on, in that the first and

the second intermediate frequency oscillator (5, 11)
have different frequency bands, and in that the phase

detection device (7) is switched, in the transmission
mode, to the frequency band of the second intermediate

frequency oscillator (11) and, in the reception mode,
to the frequency band of the first intermediate

frequency oscillator (5).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the phase detection device (7)

comprises a phase detector (21) and an upstream
frequency divider (22) whose division ratio can be

changed via the second band control signal (10).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the carrier frequency signal is

produced by a controllable oscillator (20).
