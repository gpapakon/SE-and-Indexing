<ABSTRACT>
Differences in thermal expansion properties between integrated circuit chips, especially of gallium arsenide, and the dielectric substrates (especially diamond and aluminum nitride) on which said chips are mounted are accommodated by interposing between the substrate and the chip a base having diamond pedestals in combination with a material of higher coefficient of thermal expansion than the substrate, typically a metal such as copper or tungsten. The base may be integral with a diamond substrate or may be a shim interposed between the substrate and the chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRONIC APPARATUS WITHIMPROVED THERMAL EXPANSIONMATCHThis invention relates to electronic apparatus, and more particularly to apparatus having one or more integrated circuit chips affixed to an electrically insulating substrate. Integrated circuit chips are now a major factor in the fabrication of electronic devices. In particular, multichip modules are in common use. Such modules are frequently constructed by affixing a number of chips to a dielectric substrate, typically ceramic, and connecting the chips through conductive paths or vias which may pass through holes in the substrate. A typical chip material is gallium arsenide.Electronic activity in the chip is accompanied by the generation of varying amounts of heat, which is discharged in large part by transmission to and through the substrate. As the packing density of chips increases, the amount of heat which must be discharged naturally also increases. It is usually desirable to employ a substrate material with a high thermal conductivity. Aluminum nitride is an example of a ceramic substrate material having the desired thermal and electrical properties.A problem arises, however, by reason of the differing degrees of thermal expansion of gallium arsenide and aluminum nitride. Their coefficients of thermal expansion are 5.85 and 4.5 ppm./°C, respectively. Thus, thermally induced tensile stresses are generated along the adhesion interface between the chip and the substrate.When the size of the chips, and especially the area of attachment of a chip to the substrate, is relatively small, such thermal stresses are fairly easily discharged 

and do not present a problem. This is true, for example, in the case of laser diodes whose lateral dimensions are typically on the order of 0.5 mm. However, chips employed for other purposes are increasing in size, typically being as large as 12 mm. in length and/or width with dimensions up to 6 mm. being commonplace. Such chips are also typically very thin, often on the order of 100 microns. When this is the case, the large tensile stresses between the chip and the substrate can result in various detrimental effects such as cracking of the chip or its separation from the substrate.By reason of its extremely high thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity, diamond is becoming of greater and greater interest as a substrate material for integrated circuits. While single-crystal diamond as exemplified by natural diamond may be used for this purpose, synthetic polycrystalline diamond is more common because of
