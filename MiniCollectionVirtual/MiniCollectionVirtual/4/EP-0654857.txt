<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electrical socket provided with a retractable shutter designed to close off the openings of the socket in the absence of a plug corresponding to this socket. This socket (10) includes an element (11) for supporting the current-distributing cavities (12), a cassette (13) serving for mounting the shutter (14) and containing a return spring (15), and a front shell (body) (16) mounted at the front of the socket. The shutter includes two pads (27) intended to shut off the openings (31) made in this shell in order to allow the pins (33) of a plug (32) to pass through. It is urged in the closure position by a return spring of the leaf-spring type. This shutter is balanced on the spring in such a way that it opens only if the pins (33) are inserted simultaneously.

<CLAIMS>
A current socket base comprising a support element for current distribution
recesses, a front plate arranged to receive a plug of a piece of electrical equipment, a

cylindrical element arranged between said support element and said front plate and
supporting a retractable blanking plate designed to occupy a rest position in which it

blanks off openings made in the front plate and intended to give access to said
current distribution recesses, and a retracted position in which it frees said openings,

wherein

the base (10, 10a) comprises an independent spring (15, 15a) mounted on said
cylindrical element (21, 21a) to urge the blanking plate (14, 14a) up against the rear

face of the front plate (16, 16a), the spring (15, 15a) being of the leaf type shaped as
a rocker,
a guide ramp (22) is arranged on said cylindrical element to operate in conjunction
with a circular opening (28) of the blanking plate, said ramp having a first section

(22a) appreciably parallel to the axis of the cylindrical element (21) and a second
section (22b) inclined with respect to said axis, to generate a combined movement of

axial translation and rotation of the blanking plate around the axis of said cylindncal
element.
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that the guide ramp (22) has
partially an appreciably spiral-shaped profile.
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that leaf spring (15, 15a)
comprises an annular central part and at least two arms (23, 23a) raised with respect

to this annular part to exert a bearing pressure on the blanking plate (14, 14a) in the
rest position.
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that the blanking plate (14, 14a)
comprises at least two arms (26, 26a) equipped with studs (27, 27a) located at the

end of these arms, these studs being arranged to engage at least partially in said
openings (31, 31a) of the front plate. 
The base according to claim 4, characterized in that said studs (27, 27a) have a
flat or convex surface.
The base according to claim 4, characterized in that it comprises a seal (40) fitted
between the front plate (16, 16a) and the blanking plate (14, 14a).
