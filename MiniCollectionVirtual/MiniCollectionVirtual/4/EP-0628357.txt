<ABSTRACT>
Method for processing sheets in a processing apparatus comprising 
a plurality of processing stations and a control system 

controlling at least one processing station for printing sheets 
and/or assembling sheets to form at least one document to be 

mailed. By means of a text unit not belonging to the processing 
apparatus, at least one digital document in digital form is 

generated, in which at least one digital code also generated with 
the text unit is included. This code comprises information about 

the manner in which the control system is to control the 
processing stations. The digital document is supplied to the 

control system in digital form, whereafter the control system 
records the digital document in digital form, recognizes the code 

and controls the processing station depending on the code.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for processing sheets in a
mail processing apparatus comprising a number of processing
stations, at least including a printer and an inserter, and a
control system controlling at least one processing station for
printing sheets and assembling sheets to form at least one
document to be mailed, wherein utilizing a text unit not
belonging to the mail processing apparatus, at least one digital
document is generated in digital form, in which at least one
digital code also generated with the text unit is included, said
digital code comprising information about the manner in which the
control system is to control the processing stations, the digital
document is supplied to the control system in digital form, the
control system records the digital document in digital form,
recognizes the digital code from the recorded digital document in
digital form and, depending on the recognized digital code,
controls at least one processing station other than the printer.The invention also relates to a mail processing system
comprising a mail processing apparatus comprising a plurality of
processing stations, at least including a printer and an
inserter, and a control system capable of controlling the
printer and at least one other processing station for printing
sheets and assembling sheets to form at least one document to be
mailed, wherein the system further comprises a separate text
unit, not belonging to the mail processing apparatus, capable of
generating at least one digital document in digital form, in
which at least one digital code also generated with the text
unit is included, said digital code comprising information about
the manner in which the control system is to control the
processing stations for printing and assembling sheets; and
wherein the control system, when the digital document is being
supplied to it in digital form, is capable of recording the
digital document in digital form, recognizing the digital code
from the recorded digital document and, depending on the code,
controlling at least one processing station other than the
printer. Such a method, and a mail processing system for practising
that method, are often used when large amounts of documents, such
as letters, bills, bank statements and the like are to be mailed.
A difficulty involved here is that no efficient method is
available for indicating how exactly a document to be mailed is
to be assembled. Thus, it is often necessary to indicate whether
a letter is merely to be printed, is to be inserted in an
en
