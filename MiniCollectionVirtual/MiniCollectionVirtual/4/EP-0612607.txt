<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tensile body or a tie rod with at least one integrally formed profile, comprising an inner part produced preferably by pultrusion from a first polymer, which is reinforced with continuous fibres, and at least one enveloping layer of at least one further fibre-reinforced polymer. The invention also relates to a method for fabricating such tensile bodies or tie rods which is characterised by the following steps:     - penetration of the continuous fibres with the first polymer,   - forming of the tensile body inner part blank by pultrusion, - application to the blank inner part of the at least one enveloping layer (3,7,8) of at least one chopped-fibre-reinforced further polymer, - optionally, partial curing or temperature controlling of the blank,   - forming of an integrally formed profile (4) in the at least one enveloping layer (3,7,8) of the blank over at least part of the overall length of the blank,   - complete curing of the tensile body blank, - cutting to size of the tensile body from the tensile body blank
