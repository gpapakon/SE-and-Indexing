<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to short carbon fiber 
reinforced hydraulic composite materials exhibiting 
excellent strength properties suitable for use mainly in the 
field of civil engineering and construction industry. Carbon fiber reinforced hydraulic composite materials 
have been developed to improve the poor strength of commonly 
used materials such as mortar etc. by making use of high 
tensile strength and modulus exhibited by carbon fibers. 
These composite materials are excellent in bending strength, 
tensile strength and toughness. There has been known a process in which carbon fibers 
are bound together by means of a water-soluble polymer 
binder and are individually dispersed during kneading to 
give a carbon fiber reinforced hydraulic composite material 
(see Japanese Patent Application Laying Open No.63-162559). A problem of the material obtained from the known 
process referred to above is that when a water-soluble 
binder was used, the obtained material was poor in bending 
strength and an intimate bonding of fibers and cement was 
made impossible, thus failing to impart satisfactory  
 
strength to the final composite material. Another problem is that since cement particles have a 
large particle diameter often reaching about 100 µm at 
maximum, cement particles are unable to penetrate between 
carbon fibers so that it becomes difficult for carbon fibers 
to be securely bonded to cement. There have also been reported the results in which the 
strength of cement was increased by the addition of silica 
having particle diameter of 0.02 to 0.5µm. However, when 
such silica was added to cement in an amount of 10 wt% or 
more ( "%" used herein means wt% unless otherwise noticed) 
based on the weight of cement, flowability was decreased and 
operation was made difficult. An increase of water/cement 
ratio for keeping proper flowability gives rise to another 
problem of a significant decrease of strength. On the other 
hand, when silica is added in an amount less than 10%, the 
presence of silica in the vicinity of carbon fibers becomes 
less probable, thus difficult to take advantage of a micro 
filler effect for achieving an improved bonding of carbon 
fibers and cement. There is also a process in which a two-pack epoxy 
emulsion binder having a high content of dispersed silica is 
employed in order that the silica may be deposited onto 
carbon fibers (see Japanese Patent Publication No.4-2715). 
But, when such binder is used, short carbon fibers in the  
 
form of strands are not likely to
