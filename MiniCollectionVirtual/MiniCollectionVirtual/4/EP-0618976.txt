<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation in part application
of U.S. serial no. 772,027 filed October 4, 1991, which
disclosure is herein incorporated in its entirety.The present invention relates to DNA sequences encoding
insecticidal proteins, and expression of these sequences in
plants.Expression of the insecticidal protein (IP) genes
derived from Bacillusthuringiensis (Bt) in plants has proven
extremely difficult. Attempts have been made to express
chimeric promoter/Bt IP gene combinations in plants.
Typically, only low levels of protein have been obtained in
transgenic plants. See, for example, Vaeck et al., Nature
328:33-37, 1987; Barton et al., Plant Physiol. 85:1103-1109,
1987; Fischoff et al., Bio/Technology 5:807-813, 1987.One postulated explanation for the cause of low
expression is that fortuitious transcription processing sites
produce aberrant forms of Bt IP mRNA transcript. These
aberrantly processed transcripts are non-functional in a plant,
in terms of producing an insecticidal protein. Possible
processing sites include polyadenylation sites, intron splicing
sites, transcriptional termination signals and transport 
signals. Most genes do not contain sites that will
deleteriously affect gene expression in that gene's normal host
organism. However, the fortuitous occurrence of such
processing sites in a coding region might complicate the
expression of that gene in transgenic hosts. For example, the
coding region for the Bt insecticidal crystal protein gene
derived from Bacillusthuringiensis strain kurstaki (GENBANK
BTHKURHD, accession M15271, B.thuringiensis var. kurstaki,
HD-1; Geiser et al. Gene 48:109-118 (1986)) as derived directly
from Bacillusthuringiensis, might contain sites which prevent
this gene from being properly processed in plants.Further difficulties exist when attempting to express
Bacillusthuringiensis protein in an organism such as a plant.
It has been discovered that the codon usage of a native Bt IP
gene is significantly different from that which is typical of a
plant gene. In particular, the codon usage of a native Bt IP
gene is very different from that of a maize gene. As a result,
the mRNA from this gene may not be efficiently utilized. Codon
usage might influence the expression of genes at the level of
translation or transcription or mRNA processing. To optimize
an insecticidal gene for expression in plants, attempts have
been made to alter the gene to resemble, as much as possible,
genes naturally contained within the host plant to be
transformed.Adang et al., EP
