<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a pharmaceutical composition for 
treating or preventing allergic rhinitis which comprises a 

quinone or hydroquinone derivative having thromboxane Aâ‚‚ 
receptor antagonism. This compound is hardly inactivated by 

in vivo metabolism and can maintain its effective blood level 
for a long term and exhibit excellent pharmacological activity 

in a low dose.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use for formulation of
a pharmaceutical composition for treating or preventing allergic
rhinitis of a quinone or hydroquinone derivative having
thromboxane A2 receptor antagonism.Allergic rhinitis is a type I allergic disease of
nasal mucosa causing paroxysmal and repetitive sneeze, nasal
mucus and nasal congestion as three major symptoms. Although
antihistamic agents have widely been used to treat and prevent
allergic rhinitis, they are not necessarily satisfactory
because they are not so effective against nasal congestion of
allergic rhinitis and have side effects such as sleepiness,
malaise, sedation due to inhibitory action on the central
nervous system and cholilytic action. Chemical mediators
other than histamine, such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins,
platelet-activating factor (PAF) and thromboxane A2,
particularly leukotrienes, are believed to be related to nasal
congestion on the basis of onset mechanisms of allergic
rhinitis (Minoru Okuda, Allergy, Vol. 39, p. 301-306 (1990)). Compounds having thromboxane A2 receptor antagonism,
for example, quinone compounds disclosed in USP 5,180,742 and
JP-A 63-101322 have been known to be useful as anti-allergic
agent, but have never been known to be useful as medicaments
for treating and preventing allergic rhinitis.The main object of the present invention is to
provide a pharmaceutical composition for treating or
preventing allergic rhinitis which comprises a quinone or
hydroquinone derivative having thromboxane A2 receptor
antagonism.This object as well as other objects and advantages
of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled
in the art from the following description.The present invention provides the use for formulation of
a pharmaceutical composition for treating or preventing allergic
rhinitis of a quinone derivative of the formula (Ia):
 
wherein
R1 and R2 are each independently a methyl group or
methoxy group, or R1 and R2 are linked together to form
-CH=CH-CH=CH-;R3 is a phenyl group, naphthyl group or thienyl group
each of which may optionally be substituted as defined below;R4 is a carboxyl group or a group convertible to a
carboxyl group in vivo;n is an integer of 3 to 15;
or said compound in hydroquinone form.EP-A-92136 and J. Int. Med. Res., 18(2), 1990, p. 75-88 teach the
use of quinone derivatives for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.Preferably, both of R1 and R2 are a methyl group.Examples of the naphthyl group represented by R3 in
the above formula (Ia) include 1- or 2-naphthyl.
