<ABSTRACT>
A metering system (10) is provided which controls the amount of fuel 
supplied to the combustion chambers of a multi-cylinder internal 

combustion engine comprising a fuel pump (12) for supplying fuel at low 
pressure to a first and a second group of unit fuel injectors (14,16), a 

first 
solenoid-operated fuel control valve (20) controlling the flow of fuel 

to the first 
set of injectors (14) and a second solenoid-operated fuel control valve 

(24) controlling the flow of fuel to the second set of injectors (16). 
The system may 

also include first and second solenoid-operated timing fluid control 
valves (18,22) 

associated with the first and the second group of injectors (14,16), 
respectively. 

The injectors are capable of being in the fuel receiving mode, 
establishing 

a metering period, and the timing receiving mode, establishing a timing 
period, at the same time to increase the amount of time available for 

metering both timing fluid and fuel. By grouping the various injectors 
based on the order of injection so that the injectors from each group are 

placed in the injection mode in spaced periods throughout each cycle of 
the 

engine, e.g. injectors from other groups injecting in the period of time 
between each injection mode, the system can be designed to permit longer 

metering and timing periods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a metering system for controlling the amount of fuel supplied 
to the combustion chambers of a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine and in 
particular to such a metering system as described in the preamble of claim 1. It is known from JP-A-58-131 388, which represents the closest 
prior art to divide the plurality of unit injectors in an injector system 
into two groups and to operate the two sets of unit injectors in 
a specific way. The construction of unit injector for an injector system as 
described in JP-A-58-131 388 is well known prior art as well (GB - A - 
2 030 222). In such unit injector particular attention has to be given to the different 
control of a fuel supply on the one hand and timing fluid supply to the unit injectors 
on the other hand. In general there is a continuing need for a simple, reliable, low cost yet high 
performance fuel injection system which can effectively and predictably control both 
fuel injection timing and metering. However, the design of such a fuel injection 
system necessarily involves acceptance of some characteristics which are less than 
optimal since the basic goals of low cost, high performance and reliability are often in 
direct conflict. For example, distributor-type fuel injector systems 
having a single centralized high pressure pump and a distributor 
valve for metering and timing fuel flow from the pump to each of a 
plurality of injection nozzles are in this way 
less expensive than systems with individual cam operated unit injectors 
at each engine cylinder location such as illustrated in US-A-4,392,612. 
The unit injectors disclosed in US - A - 4,392,612 are designed 
so that each solenoid valve must close and open during a single injection stroke of 
the injector pump or plunger as the plunger moves inwardly to control the beginning 
and end of injection, respectively. Since each injection stroke of the plunger must 
occur in an extremely short period of time near the top dead center position of the 
corresponding engine piston as it completes the compression stroke and commences 
the power stroke, the design, operation and control of the solenoid valve becomes a 
critical, and often costly, consideration in the design of the unit fuel injector. In fact, it 
has been found that these types of unit injectors are not always capable of achieving 
predictable and effective control of the timing and metering of fuel injection over a 
wide range of operating conditions. Commercially competitive fuel injector systems of
