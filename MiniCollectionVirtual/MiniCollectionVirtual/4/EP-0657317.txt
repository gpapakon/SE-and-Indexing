<ABSTRACT>
This arrangement comprises a pipe for filling the tank, equipped at one end (12) delimiting an opening (20) for introducing a fuel filler nozzle (14) including, in its lower part, an orifice (16) for detecting an overflow of fuel, and a flap (22) for sealing off the introduction opening (20), the flap being articulated at its lower part while being elastically urged into its shutting-off position. The flap (22) has two parts (22A, 22B) which are articulated respectively about two coplanar axes substantially transverse with respect to the end (12) of the pipe, forming an angle between them so that in the shut-off position of the flap, the two parts (22A, 22B) thereof are contiguous and so that in the open position of the flap the two parts (22A, 22B) thereof are separated from one another in order to free the orifice (16).

An arrangement for filling a motor vehicle fuel tank of the type comprising a duct for 
filling the tank provided with an end (12) bounding an opening (20) for inserting a fuel 

delivery gun nozzle (14) comprising in its lower section a port (16) for detecting fuel 
over-flow, and a valve (22) for closing the insertion opening (20), which valve is 

articulated in its lower part by being resiliently acted upon in the direction of its closed 
position, characterised in that the valve (22) comprises two sections (22A, 22B) 

respectively articulated about two coplanar axes (X, Y) which are substantially 
transversal in relation to the end of the duct and form an angle (α) therebetween, in such 

a manner that when the valve is closed, the two sections (22A, 22B) of the said valve 
abut, and when the valve is open, the sections (22A, 22B) of the valve are separated from 

each other to open the port (16) for detecting fuel over-flow. 
An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the opening (20) for inserting 
the nozzle of the gun is bounded by a calibration collar (18) preventing the insertion of a 

gun nozzle larger in diameter than the diameter of the collar. 
An arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the valve (22) is acted 
upon in the direction of its closed position by a generally U-shaped resilient pin (44), the 

two branches (44A, 44B) of the pin cooperating respectively with the two sections (22A, 
22B) of the valve and being wound around spindles (28, 30) for articulating these 

sections. 
An arrangement according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
valve (22) has a generally round shape when it is closed, since the two sections (22A, 

22B) of the valve are substantially bounded by the diameter of the valve, which diameter 
bisects the angle (α) formed by the axes (X, Y) for articulating these sections.
