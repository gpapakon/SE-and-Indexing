<ABSTRACT>
A non-resealble vent closure for galvanic cells, such as 
nonaqueous oxyhalide cells, which comprises a member (56) 

force-fitted within a vent orifice (25) and wherein a corrosion-Â­
resistant material (27) which is not an integral part of the 

force-fitted member (56) is disposed between the wall 
defining the vent orifice (25) and the force-fitted member (56) 

so as to predictably insure venting after a predetermined gas 
pressure build-up within the cell.
