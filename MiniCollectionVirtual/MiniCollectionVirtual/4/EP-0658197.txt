<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for replacing a gene or a gene segment in the germ line of a non-human mammal by a homologous gene or by a homologous gene segment of another mammal. The process comprises the following steps: (i) an embryonic parent stem line is transfected by a selectively marked recombination vehicle; (ii) stably transfected cell clones are selected on the basis of the presence of the marker gene; (iii) these are selected in a targeted way by PCR and/or Southern Blot; (iv) these are injected into the blastocysts of the non-human mammal; and (v) the blastocysts are transferred into surrogate mothers. The process is characterized in that during recombination the endogenous gene or the endogenous gene segment is functionally replaced in a single step by the homologous gene or by the homologous gene segment thanks to the selectively marked recombination vehicle.

A method of producing a homozygous transgenic mouse by homologous recombination, comprising the step of replacing an antibody gene or antibody gene segment in the germ line of the mouse by a homologous antibody gene or a homologous antibody gene segment of a human, wherein:

(i) the embryonic stem cell line of the mouse is transfected with a recombination vehicle comprising a selectable marker, wherein said recombination vehicle is a replacement vector comprising the homologous gene segment to be introduced or the homologous gene to be introduced, sequences being homologous to the sequences flanking the endogenous DNA segment to be replaced, and a marker gene, and in the recombination event, the endogenous gene or gene segment is functionally replaced by said homologous gene or said homologous gene segment in one step by means of said recombination vehicle comprising a selectable marker;
(ii) stably transfected cell clones are selected for the presence of the marker gene; and
(iii) purposefully selected by PCR and/or Southern blotting.
The method according to claim 1, wherein:

(i) in said recombination vehicle comprising a selectable marker, said marker gene is selected from neomycin and hygromycin, especially neomycin; and/or
(ii) said recombination vehicle comprises additional functional gene sequences, especially viral recognition sequences, sequences for enhancing gene expression, and target sequences for prokaryotic and eukaryotic recombination systems, especially the Cre recognition sequence LoxP and flip recognition sequence Frt.
The method according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said marker gene is neomycin.
The method according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 said recombination vehicle comprising a selectable marker is pTZ2-CkN (PA-) (DSM 7211).
The method according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 marker genes and any target gene segments still present are removed in a second reaction step by means of target sequences.
A homozygous transgenic mouse obtainable by a method according to one or more of claims 1 to 5.
Use of the homozygous mouse according to claim 6 for the expression of humanized monoclonal antibodies.
