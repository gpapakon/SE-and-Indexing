<ABSTRACT>
A device for turning rotary motion into translatory motion, which device comprises at least three concentrically arranged threaded elements (2, 3, 4, 5). An externally threaded first element (2) is in engagement with an internally threaded second element (3). The second element (3) is furthermore provided with external screw thread (15), which is in engagement with an internally threaded third element (4). The second element is tubular, whereby the internal and external screw threads have been provided simultaneously by hydromechanical deformation of a metal tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
DEVICE FOR CONVERTING ROTARY MOTION INTO RECIPROCATING MOTIONThe invention relates to a device for turning rotary motion into translatory motion, which device comprises at least three concentrically arranged threaded elements, wherein an externally threaded first element is in engagement with an internally threaded second element, which second element is furthermore provided with external screw thread, which is in engagement with an internally threaded third element. In a similar device, which is known from British patentGB-827 , 271 , the second element is rotated, as a result of which the first and the third element are moved in opposite axial directions. The second element is provided with internal and external screw threads, which have been formed in a tube by means of for example a metal -removing technique. One drawback of such a method of manufacturing and internally and externally threaded tube is that it is a relatively labour- intensive process, whereby furthermore a relatively great deal of material must be discharged.The object of the invention is to provide a device which comprises an internally and externally threaded element which is relatively easy to manufacture.This objective is accomplished with the device according to the invention in that said second element is tubular, whereby the internal and external screw threads have been provided simultaneously by hydromechanical deformation of a metal tube.By hydromechanical deformation of a tube a metal tubular element with internal and external screw thread can be obtained in a relatively simple and inexpensive way.When a hydromechanical deformation operation is carried out, a metal tube is placed into a mould, whereby said mould is provided with a profile which corresponds with the desired external shape of the second element.The ends of the tube are closed by movable, cyl indrical pistons. Then a fluid, such as oil or water, is introduced into the tube under pressure, whereby the tube is deformed by the fluid pressure. During said deformation the cylindrical pistons are moved in a direction towards each other, whereby the pistons exert an axial pressure force on the tube. 

The axial pressure force ensures a proper sealing action between the tube and the pistons, whilst the tube may also be upset, if desired. The axial pressure force and the fluid pressure press the tube against the walls of the mould, and the tube takes a shape which corresponds with the profile. It is also possible to use a deformable, non-compressible material such as
