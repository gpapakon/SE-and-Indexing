Method for branching off and inserting digital
signals (DSA1, ... DSB1) transmitted in channels of a

multiplex signal (MSE1, MSA1; MSE2, MSA2),

characterized

in that the incoming multiplex signals (MSE1, MSE2) are
converted, word by word, into transformed multiplex

signals (MDE1, MDE2) in which data words having twice
the bit rate are respectively followed by gaps of equal

length,
in that one transformed multiplex signal (MDE2) is
synchronized to the other transformed multiplex signal

(MDE1) by a controllable delay device (ES),
in that the digital signals (DSA1, DSB1 ...) which are
to be branched off from the associated channels (KA1,

KB1, ...) of each transformed multiplex signal (MDE1,
MDE2) are allocated an uneven or an even bus time slot

(BZL), and, having been combined to form a time-division
multiplex signal (ZME), are supplied to all

the line modules (KK1 ... KKn),
in that the digital signals (EDSA1, EDSB1 ...) which
are to be transmitted by the line modules (KK1 ... KKn)

are combined, to the same extent for both transmission
directions, to form a time-division multiplex signal

(ZMS),
in that a digital signal (EDSA1) which is to be
inserted is respectively inserted into the associated 

data channel (KA1) of a transformed multiplex signal
(MDA1) and converted into a multiplex signal (MSA1)

Method according to Claim 1,

characterized

characterized

in that the transformed multiplex signals (MDE1, MDE2;
MDA1, MDA2) are transmitted in series or byte by byte

in parallel.
