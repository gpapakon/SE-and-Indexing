<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to 
provide a power line connection circuit which obtains a 

desired turn-on resistance and a turn-off resistance 
without using a complex external circuit. The power line 

connection circuit provides a MOS transistor 10 
arranged in a power supply line 200, whose continuity 

is changable by applying a control signal from a 
control unit 6; a voltage conversion means for 

converting the voltage of the control signal; and a 
clamp means 9 for clamping the converted voltage output 

from the voltage conversion means 2 so as to have a 
predetermined voltage difference with respect to the 

voltage of said power supply line 200.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power line
connection circuit for controlling the connection of an
electrical device to a power supply line and a switching
IC for a power supply line. More specifically, the
invention relates to a power line connection circuit
which has a small turn-on resistance and has a
discharge circuit in order to stabilize a voltage of the
power supply line.In electrical devices, it is important to reduce
power consumpution. Particularly, when a battery is
used as a power supply, power consumption is very
important because power consumption influences the life
of the battery. Namely, power consumption determines
the time for which the battery can be used without being
exchanged or charged. There has been proposed a power
conservation method in which a device is divided into a
plurality of portions, and the supply of power to non-operating
portions is shut-off. Many kinds of
electrical devices include functional portions which
must always operate even if the devices are not being
used. For example, in an electrical device having a
timer function, the timer function must operate even
when the device is not being used. However, if power is
supplied to the whole device in order to operate the
timer function even when the device is not used, there
occurrs a problem that large power is consumed because
standby currents flow in the portions which are not 
needed. Therefore, when the above power conservation
method is applied to this device, the device is divided
into a main portion and a sub-portion having a timer
function. Power is not supplied to the main portion when
the device is not used but power is supplied to the
sub-portion even when the device is not used.Further, in a computer system, a plurality of
peripheral devices such as a display, a disk unit, a
printer, etc. are connected to a computer. These
peripheral devices may not always operate even when the
computer operates. Therefore, power consumption of the
computer system can be reduced by stopping the supply
of power to peripheral devices which are not needed.In order to perform the above method, it is
necessary to freely stop the supply of power to each
portion. A power line switch IC is used to control
connection between the power supply line and each
portion. The switch IC is controlled by a control signal
output from a control portion included in the sub-portion
which always operates.In general, a power FET has been used as the
power line switch, and the power line connection
circuit has heretofore been realized as a
