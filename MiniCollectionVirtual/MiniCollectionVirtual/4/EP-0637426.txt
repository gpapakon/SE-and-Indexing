<ABSTRACT>
The lying plane (1) comprises one or more superimposed 
layers (3). Each layer is as wide as the surface of the 

bed and has uniform thickness and is elastically yielding 
under the weight of the user. Said layer or at least one 

of said layers (3) is crossed by transverse straight 
channels (5) longitudinally spaced apart along the lying 

plane. Elements (7) having the same length and similar 
cross section as the channels (5) are inserted within at 

least some of such channels; said elements (7) are closen 
among types which, as far as the constructional material 

and the conformation thereof are concerned, have different 
flexural rigidities in the plane perpindicular to the 

lying plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
Bed lying planes usually comprise one or more layers 
of uniform thickness characterized by being more or less 
pliable in a direction perpendicular to the lying plane. One example of said layers are mattresses made up of 
bags of suitable shape and filled with natural or 
artificial fibres: said type of mattresses possess a poor 
transverse yielding characteristics, so that they are 
usually employed by having them supported by planes, which 
are in turn yelding and made up of a metal springbed or of 
thin and slightly curved woodden slats, or spring sacks. Further examples are the so-called spring mattresses, 
comprising two fabric layers with interposed springs 
yielding in a direction perpendicular to the lying plane, 
or mattresses made of rubber foam or synthetic elastic 
foamed material, or inflatable mattresses. All these types 
of mattresses, owing to their compliance in the thickness 
direction, may be simply laid down on a rigid plane. All the above cases refer to systems having a 
predetermined rigidity which can be varied only by 
substantially changing the system itself, for example, by 
putting more mattresses one on top of the other or 
changing the type of support. In any case, the system has 
an approximately uniform compliance in the lying plane,  
 
possibly enhenced in the middle, so that it may be 
detrimental to the correct orthopedic posture, especially 
if the mattress support is a springbed. Solutions embodying regions with different compliance 
have in any case fixed compliance characteristics, which 
do not always meet the requirements of the user. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
lying plane comprising one or more layers with rigidity 
varying according to the dimensions of the body of the 
user, such as height and bulkiness, and to the different 
personal requirements and wishes of the user. The or each 
layer is as wide as the surface of the bed and has uniform 
thickness but elastically yielding under the weight of the 
user, and is crossed by transverse channels having 
straight development. Such channels are spaced apart is 
the longitudinal direction of the lying plane, and 
inserted within at least some of them are elements having 
length and cross-section mostly similar to those of the 
channels. Said elements are chosen among types which, as 
far as the constructional material and the conformation 
thereof are concerned, have different characteristics of 
flexural rigidity in the plane perpendicular to the lying 
plane, and/or of compression

<CLAIMS>
1) Lying plane (1; 101) for beds, comprising one or 
more superimposed layers (3; 103), each layer having 

sobstantially uniform thickness and being elastically 

yielding under the weight of user resting on said plane, 
characterized in that said layer (3; 103) or at least one 

of said layers (3; 103) is crossed by transverse channels 
(5; 105) having straight development and spaced apart 

along the lying plane, and that in at least some of such 
channels, elements (7; 107) are inserted having 

approximately the same length as the channels (5; 105), 
said elements (7; 107) being chosen among types which, as 

far as the constructional material and conformation 
thereof are concerned, have different properties of 

rigidity in the plane perpendicular to the lying plane, 
and/or of compression in the direction of the layer 

thickness.

that said channels (5; 105) are uniformly spaced apart. 
3) Lying plane according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that said channels (5; 105) are through channels, open 

at both ends. 
4) Lying plane according to one or more of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that said elements (7) are rods of 

wood, plastics or other compact material, and may have 
 

rectangular cross-section with the minor side 
perpendicular to the lying plane. 
5) Lying plane according to one or more of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that said elements (7) have tubular 

cross-section and are made up of elastic material such as 
rubber, rubber reinforced with fabric or variously 

disposed threads and the like, and have a cross-section 
sufficient to give a suitable flexural strength. 
6) Lying plane according to one or more of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that said elements (7) have 

cylindrical cross-section and are made of spongy material, 
or the like, of such characteristics as to provide 

different flexural properties.

elements (107) are further provided with a valve (109) for 
the admission of air and/or water or other suitable
