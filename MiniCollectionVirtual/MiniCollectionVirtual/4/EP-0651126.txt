<ABSTRACT>
The method according to the invention has the characteristic 
that gypsum or similar fire-resistant material (29) 

is arranged in the frame profiles (5) during prefabrication, 
wherein cavities (30) for frame clamps and mitre joints are 

left open, and that the thus prefabricated frame profiles 
are transported to their mounting location in the building 

structure and are fixed to the wall edges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for manufacturing
a fire-resistant partition as designated in the
preamble of claim 1.EP-A-0 140 436 discloses a method for manufacturing
a partition for a zone of a building structure,
comprising a frame fixed to wall edges of a wall passage
and a door received therein, which frame comprises substantially
U-shaped, steel frame profiles which are
arranged on edges of the wall opening with deforming of
the U-shape of the frame profiles and are fixedly clamped
to said edges by means of clamps arranged in the frame
profiles and provided with adjusting means, wherein the
frame profiles are mutually connected by means of mitre
joints.Although not disclosed in EP-A-0 140 436 it is
known in the art that in case the partition should be
fire-resistant, a fire-resistant door is mounted in the
frame and the profiles and gypsum is injected through an
opening arranged for this purpose in the frame into the
space bounded by the wall edges and the inner side of the
frame profiles. The frame clamps and the mitre joints are
herein embedded in the gypsum.In practice the operation of filling the frame
is often found to have been carried out poorly because
the filling is not performed adequately. It is in any
case not possible to see from outside whether filling has
taken place correctly or not.In the case the frame is placed at a late stage
in the building, for example after wallpapering has
already taken place and/or floor covering has been laid,
there is the danger of liquid or plastic material being
spilt on wallpaper and/or floor covering. This danger
then occurs particularly when gypsum is injected in 
considerable pressure, which is otherwise necessary to
realize an adequate filling in a short time.The invention provides a method as designated
in claim 1 with which the above stated problems are
resolved.It is possible on the one hand to guarantee
arrangement in simple manner of sufficient fire-resistant
material in the frame profiles during the manufacturing
process, while on the other hand the danger of causing a
mess in a practically finished building structure is
avoided.DE-U-84 37574 discloses a method for
manufacturing a fire-resistant partition for a zone of a
building structure, comprising a fire-resistant frame
whereto wall edges of a wall passage are fixed and a
fire-resistant door is received therein, which frame
comprises substantially U-shaped, steel frame profiles
whereto edges of the wall opening are arranged, wherein
the frame profiles will be mutually connected by

Method for manufacturing a fire-resistant partition
for a zone of a building structure, comprising a

fire-resistant frame fixed to wall edges of a wall passage
and a fire-resistant door received therein, which

frame comprises substantially U-shaped, steel frame
profiles which are arranged on edges (7) of the wall

opening with deforming of the U-shape of the frame profiles
(4-6) and are fixedly clamped to said edges by

means of clamps (10) arranged in the frame profiles (4-6)
and provided with adjusting means (9), wherein the frame

profiles (4-6) are mutually connected by means of mitre
joints (8) and wherein in the space bounded by the inner

side of the frame profiles (4-6) and the wall edges (7)
gypsum or similar crystalline bonded, water-containing,

fire-resistant material (29) is arranged, 
characterized
in that
 gypsum or similar fire-resistant material (29) is
arranged in the frame profiles (4-6) during prefabrication,

wherein cavities (30, 31) for frame clamps 10 and
mitre joints 8 are left open and that each of the thus prefabricated

frame profiles (4-6) are transported to their
mounting location in the building structure and are fixed

to the wall edges (7). 
Method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 strips (29) of gypsum or similar water-containing
material are fixedly adhered to the inside of the profiles

(4-6).
Method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 gypsum (29) or similar water-containing material is
arranged in plastic or liquid form in the frame profiles

(4-6) during a prefabrication.
Fire-resistant partition manufactured as claimed
in claim 1, 2 or 3 for a zone of a building structure,

comprising a fire-resistant frame disposed in a wall
passage and a fire-resistant door (26) received therein,

which frame comprises substantially U-shaped, deformable
profiles (4-6) in which are fixed clamps (10) provided 

with adjusting means (9) and mitre connecting means (8)
and wherein gypsum or similar water-containing, fire-resistant

material is arranged, 
characterized in that

gypsum (29) or similar crystalline bonded, water-containing,
fire-resistant material is arranged in the frame

profiles (4-6) during prefabrication, wherein cavities
(30, 31) for frame clamps (10) and mitre corner joints

(8) are left open.
Fire-resistant partition (1) as claimed in claim
4, 
characterized in that
 the frame has a locking pin (45)
received therein which moves outward out of the frame

profile (4) under the influence of fire heat into a
recess (47) arranged for this purpose in the closing edge

of the door (26).
Frame for a fire-resistant partition (1) as
claimed in claim 1, which frame comprises substantially

U-shaped deformable profiles (4-6) in which are fixed
clamps (10) provided with adjusting means (9) and mitre

connecting means (8) and in which gypsum or similar
crystalline bonded, water-containing, fire-resistant

material (29) is arranged,
