<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clarifying 
composition, and more specifically, to a clarifying 
composition which is useful as an additive for improving the 
stabilization and transparency of crystalline propylene 
polymer materials at lower processing temperatures. Typically, crystalline propylene polymer materials, such 
as polypropylene and propylene polymer based copolymers have 
found extensive use in various formed articles, such as 
injection-molded articles, blow-molded articles, films, sheets 
and fibers, because of their excellent mechanical properties. 
However, due to their nature, crystalline propylene polymer 
materials have the problem of being poor in transparency. To 
improve the transparency of polyolefins, nucleating or 
clarifying agents are generally incorporated therein such as 
described in U.S. 4,388,119 which discloses a composition 
consisting essentially of a solid powdery dibenzylidene 
sorbitol coated with a higher fatty acid. U.S 5,001,179 discloses the use of a dibenzylidene 
sorbitol based compound and a cyclodextrin in a crystalline 
polyolefin type composition to obtain transparency and odor-non-emitting 
properties. While incorporating the sorbitol based compounds in 
polyolefin resins improves the transparency of the polyolefin 
resin, high processing temperatures must be used in order to 
melt and properly disperse the sorbitol-based compound which 
have melting points of at least 220°C. Low processing temperatures are preferred in the industry 
to prevent the degradation or decomposition of the propylene 
polymer material. However, at lower processing temperatures  
 
white specks of unmelted and poorly dispersed sorbitol-based 
compounds are found in the resulting molded articles because 
the processing temperature is lower than the melting points of 
the sorbitol based compounds. Thus, there is a desire to find 
clarifying agents which can be used at lower processing 
temperatures, without the problem of obtaining white specks in 
the final product. It has been found in accordance with the present 
invention that by forming an intimate mixture of a particular 
phosphonite stabilizer with certain sorbitol-based clarifiers, 
the melting point of the sorbitol-based compound is depressed 
or lowered, which enables the polyolefin composition 
containing sorbitol-based compound to be processed at a lower 
temperature and provides products without the white specking 
due to unmelted or poorly dispersed additives. According to one embodiment of the present invention
