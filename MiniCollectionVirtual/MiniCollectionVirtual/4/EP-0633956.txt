<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a composition
having high thermal stability and good sealability
properties. More particularly, the invention relates
to improved gasket materials.Gaskets and other seals are required for use
in many applications where adjacent surfaces are to
be sealed to prevent fluid or gas leakage. One
application where gaskets are particularly important
are as head gaskets for automobile engines.A variety of materials are used in gasket
manufacture. Among the different types of gasket
materials are composite gasket materials made by a
wet laid process (often known as Beater Addition
gasket material), expanded graphite gasket materials,
and multilayer steel gasket materials.Expanded graphite gasket materials are
comprised of expanded graphite flake which may
contain a small amount (1.0% or less) of a polymeric
resin such as phenolic resin or polyvinyl alcohol,
serving as binder material. These gasket materials
can be rather expensive and are effective at
relatively high operating temperatures, up to about
550°C. However, one disadvantage of these materials
is their low resistance to compressive forces,
especially after exposure to fluids such as oil or
antifreeze. Multilayer steel gasket materials are made
of multiple layers steel, both flat and embossed, and
may include a coating such as fluorine, silicone,
epoxy, or nitrile butadiene rubber. These gasket
materials are intended for harsh environments and may
be used at operating temperatures above about 550°C.
A drawback of such materials is that they require
excessively smooth and expensive joint surfaces.Composite gasket materials made by a wet
laid process (Beater Addition gasket materials) are
comprised of a fiber component which is distributed
within an elastomeric binder matrix, together with
property improving solid fillers. These materials
may be modified by silicone saturation to improve
their thermal and sealability properties. Moreover,
these materials may be used alone as "soft" gasket
materials for some applications, or they may be
laminated to steel, forming "hard" gasket materials
for other applications. The maximum operating
temperature at which these gasket materials normally
may be used is between about 200°C and 250°C.Some gasket applications, particularly for
use as automobile head gaskets, use Beater Addition
gasket material. This type of gasket, as noted
above, includes a fiber component and a filler
dispersed in an elastomeric binder matrix. The fiber
can include various synthetic or mineral fibers which
help to
