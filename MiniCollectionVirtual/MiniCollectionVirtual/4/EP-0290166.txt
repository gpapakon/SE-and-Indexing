<ABSTRACT>
Stable emulsions and dispersions of both the 
water-in- oil and oil-in-water types are prepared by 

subjecting mixtures of the two phases to shear stress in 
the presence of nitrile group-containing copolymers 

capable of forming hydrogels containing at least 90% by 
weight of water at room temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stable emulsions and 
dispersions containing a polar aqueous phase, a 
water-insoluble non-polar phase, and a nitrile containing 
copolymer emulsifying or dispersing agent, and to a 
method of making such emulsions and dispersions. By 
"stable" is meant emulsions and dispersions which do not 
exhibit phase separation when maintained at room 
temperature for prolonged periods, say 2 days or more. Acrylonitrile copolymers capable of forming 
hydrogels containing at least 90% by weight of water at 
room temperature are well known in the art. Preferably, 
the total number of nitrile groups (-CH₂-) in such


 
copolymers is between 5 and 75 percent (more preferably 
between 10 and 50 percent) of all substituent groups 
present, and at least 1/5 of such nitrile groups 
(preferably at least 1/2) are arranged in sequences 
containing at least 5 adjacent nitrile groups; they may 
be considered either graft or block copolymers, 
preferably the latter. One group of such acrylonitrile-based hydrogels 
is linear polymers having a hydrocarbon backbone to 
which are bonded nitrile groups along with other 
substituent groups such as carboxyl, carboxylate salt, 
carboxylic ester, and amide and imide groups. They may 
or may not be covalently cross-linked. For the most 
part such copolymers are made by partial hydrolysis of 
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) under appropriate conditions; 
the hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either acid or base. 
They are described, for example, in Stoy U.S. Patent 
No. 4,107,121, which is incorporated herein by reference.  Another group of such acrylonitrile-based 
hydrogels is polysaccharides, e.g., starch, grafted with 
polyacrylonitrile segments (SPAN), which are then 
hydrolyzed with base to acrylic acid or acrylamide 
segments to form the hydrogels. Under certain 
controlled hydrolysis conditions, however, the 
hydrolyzed copolymer contains residual nitrile groups in 
sequences of 5 or more. The acrylonitrile copolymer emulsifying and 
dispersing agents of the present invention are those 
acrylonitrile copolymers which are capable of forming 
hydrogels containing at least 90% by weight of water at 
room temperature, i.e. hydrogels which retain their form 
and shape without liquid flow when allowed to stand at 
room temperature. Such copolymers are, as a rule, not 
crosslinked by covalent bonds. The three-dimensional 
network in such hydrogels is formed by interactions 
between the nitrile group (-CH₂--) sequences which


 
form crystalline clusters. The clusters are
