<ABSTRACT>
Oscillation damper for a shaft rotating about an axis, comprising an inertia ring which is secured in the shaft in a relatively rotatable manner by at least one spring ring of rubber. The spring ring bears directly against the outer periphery of the shaft and is pressed non-rotatably against the shaft 3 by the inertia ring.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of a vibration absorber 
for a shaft (1) rotating about an axis, comprising an 

inertia ring (3) which is fixed in a manner which allows 
relative rotation on the shaft (1) by at least one spring 

ring (2) made of rubber, the spring ring or rings (2) being 
in direct contact with the outer circumference of the shaft 

(1) and being pressed against the shaft (1) by the inertia 
ring (3) in a manner which prevents rotation, characterized 

in that two such spring rings (2) are arranged on the shaft 
(1) and are pressed simultaneously in opposite directions 

into respective recesses which are open in the axial 
direction and are arranged at the ends of the inertia ring 

(3). 
A method according to claim 1, in which the spring 
rings (2) are adhesively bonded to the shaft (1) and/or the 

inertia ring (3) and an adhesive in microencapsulated form 
is used to carry out the adhesive bonding and is applied to 

at least one of the parts of the surface zones to be brought 
into engagement with one another before the parts are fitted 

together.
