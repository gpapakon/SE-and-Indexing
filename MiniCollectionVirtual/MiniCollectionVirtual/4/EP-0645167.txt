<ABSTRACT>
Free organic acids, hydroxy acids, fatty alcohols, sugars and hydroxy-substituted steroids are recovered from complex mixtures by mixing the material to be extracted with a polar solvent, drying the resulting mixture, then silylating, esterifying or acylating it and extracting the resulting material with a supercritical fluid at a pressure of more than 200 bar.

<CLAIMS>
A process for obtaining free organic acids, hydroxy 
acids, fatty alcohols, sugars and hydroxy-substituted 

steroids and esters of the aforementioned compounds 
from complex mixtures of substances, which 

comprises 

A) mixing the material to be extracted with a polar 
solvent or a mixture of polar solvents, and 

concentrating the resulting mixture to dryness, 
B) silylating, esterifying or acylating the material 
obtained from A) and 
C) extracting the material obtained from B) with a 
supercritical fluid under a pressure of more than 

200 bar. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein CO
2
 is 
used as supercritical fluid. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a methanol/water 
mixture in the ratio 2:1 by volume is used 

as polar solvent. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein extraction 
is carried out under a pressure of 430 to 

480 bar. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein fatty 
acids, monosaccharides, cholesterol or bile acids 

are extracted.  
 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein β-phenylpropanoic 
acid, myristic acid, indolecarboxylic 

acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, 
stearic acid, coprosterol, cholesterol, lithocholic 

acid, β-sitosterol, deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 
ursodeoxycholic acid or esters of the aforementioned 

compounds as well as mixtures of the compounds are 
extracted. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein silylation 
is carried out with hexamethyldisilazane or 

trimethylchlorosilane, esterification is carried out 
with boron trifluoride in methanol, or acylation is 

carried out with p-dimethylaminopyridine/acetic 
anhydride.
