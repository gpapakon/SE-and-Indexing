Device for fitting labelling sleeves over 
packages (3) or the like, comprising a sleeve feed 

device, a device for stretching the sleeves including two 
pairs of stretchers (6), a horizontal conveyor (2) for 

the packages (3) to be labelled, the sleeve feed device 
being arranged above and vertically in line with this 

conveyor (2), each pair of stretchers being arranged on 
either side of the conveyor pathway, the device being 

characterized in that the two pairs of stretchers can 
move vertically between the conveyor and the feed device 

for taking hold of a sleeve, by entering the lower 
opening, and putting it in place on a package. 
Device in accordance with Claim 1, characterized 
in that the stretchers (6) are arranged obliquely with 

respect to the direction of conveying of the packages and 
can move horizontally in a curved path. 
Device in accordance with either of Claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that the stretchers (6) can move 

horizontally in translation. 
Device in accordance with any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the stretchers 

(6) of the two pairs of stretchers are oriented radially 
and form angles substantially of the order of 90° between 

them and are arranged obliquely with respect to the 
conveyor substantially at angles of 45°. 
Device in accordance with Claim 3, characterized 
in that the stretchers (6) include a deformable 

parallelogram structure (6
2
). 
Device in accordance with any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the stretchers  

 
(6) are connected, for moving them horizontally and 

vertically, to one and the same motor member (7, 8). 
Device in accordance with Claim 6, characterized 
in that the motor member (7, 8) drives two cams (9, 19) 

which are kinematically linked together.
