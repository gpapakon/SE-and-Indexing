<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a disposable diaper provided with 
a liquid permeable bodyside inner liner and an at least 
substantially liquid impermeable outer layer, which form a 
front panel and a rear panel, with a liquid-absorbent batt 
sandwiched between the inner liner and the outer layer. It is noted that the term disposable diaper in this context 
is not only understood to mean a disposable device which is 
provided on small children's bodies for collecting urine 
and faeces therein, but also a disposable device in 
particular for incontinent adults. A disposable diaper of this kind is known from 
international patent application No. WO 84/04242 (Johnson & 
Johnson Products, Inc.). The known disposable diaper has a 
synthetic outer layer of polyethylene and a non-woven 
synthetic inner liner, with a batt of a fluff-like 
cellulosic material sandwiched therebetween. A drawback of the known disposable diaper is that it is 
very environment-unfriendly - because of its use of 
synthetic materials - on the one hand because its 
production requires the use of materials which are harmful 
to the environment, and on the other hand because the 
processing into waste of said materials seriously harms the 
environment. The fact of the matter is that apart from the 
fact that known disposable diapers comprising a synthetic 
outer layer and a synthetic inner liner will lie on a 
mountain of waste for a considerable period of time, they 
will also generate noxious ash remnants plus gases (CO₂ 
emission) upon being incinerated. The problem described 
herein is certainly not an imaginary one, in view of the 
enormous scale on which the known disposable diapers are 
being used. In order to overcome the above-mentioned 
drawback a so-called "diaper service" has already been 
proposed. This "diaper service" is based on the  
 
distribution of clean cotton diapers of the time-honoured 
type to users who are members of this "diaper service", 
collecting and cleaning used cotton diapers from such users 
and subsequently distributing the cleaned, used cotton 
diapers again, etc. Although the "diaper service" enjoys a 
growing popularity, a large part of the diaper users have a 
continued need for disposable diapers. The object of the invention is to provide an environment-friendly 
disposable diaper, which has excellent diaper 
properties, especially as regards absorption, comfort and 
strength, and which are easy to produce and attractively 
priced. In order to accomplish this objective a disposable diaper 
of the kind
