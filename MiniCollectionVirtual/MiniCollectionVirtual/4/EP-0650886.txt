<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bicycle with a gear change mechanism, in which the transmission of force from the shaft of the pedal 12 to the rear wheel 18 takes place via a deflecting gear 34 and a multi-stage, changeable main gear 38. A common shaft 36 is provided as the input shaft of the deflecting gear 34 and as the input shaft of the main gear 38. The gear case 26 is preferably arranged substantially within the wheel hub 28 and only protrudes out of the wheel hub 28 on the side on which the drive takes place. In this arrangement, the gear case is preferably connected to the frame 10 of the bicycle by means of a single-arm rocker 16.

<CLAIMS>
Bicycle with a change-speed gear arrangement wherein the
transmission of power from the pedal crank spindle to the

rear wheel is by way of a direction-changing transmission
means (34) and a multi-stage shiftable main transmission

means (38), and wherein a common shaft (36) serves as the
driven shaft of the direction-changing transmission means

(34) and as the drive shaft of the main transmission means
(38) characterized in that the rear wheel is fixed directly

on the driven shaft (40) of the main transmission means (38),
so that at the same time said driven shaft forms the spindle

of the rear wheel.
Bicycle according to claim 1, characterized in that the
transmission means (34, 38) are in the form of a spur geardraw

key shift arrangement.
Bicycle according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the transmission of force is further by way

of a toothed belt (22) and two belt pulleys (20, 30) of almost
equal size, one (20) of them being connected to the

pedal crank spindle and the other being connected to the
drive shaft (32) of the direction-changing transmission means

(34).
Bicycle according to claim 1, characterized in that the
spur gear set on the drive output side of the main transmission

means (38) is rotatably mounted on the driven shaft of
the main transmission means coaxially with respect thereto, 

and a freewheel means (42) is disposed between the spur gear
set and the output shaft (40).
Bicycle according to claim 4, characterized in that said
freewheel means (42) is disposed under the largest gear of

said spur gear set of the main transmission means (38).
Bicycle according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the direction-changing transmission means

(34) and the main transmission means (38) are arranged in a
common sealed oil-fillable transmission housing (26).
Bicycle according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the direction changing transmission means

(34) is disposed outside and the main transmission means (38)
is disposed within the rear wheel hub (28).
Bicycle according to claim 1 and 6, characterized in that
the transmission housing (26) is arranged substantially

within the wheel hub (28) and projects out of the wheel hub
(28) only at the side at which the drive is provided and that

it is connected to the bicycle frame (10) by means of a single-sided
swing arm (16).
Bicycle according to claim 8, characterized in that a
brake disk (56) is fixed to the hub (28) on the side towards

the swing arm (16) and that it co-operates with a brake caliper
(58) fixed on the swing arm (16) to constitute a disk

brake (44).
Bicycle according to claim, characterized in that a drum
brake means (80, 84) is disposed within the hub (28) beside 

the transmission housing (26) on same, which co-operates with
the inside surface of the hub (28).
Bicycle according to claim 7, characterized in that a

coil means (60) is rotatably mounted within the hub (28) beside
the transmission housing (26) on the same coaxially with

respect to the hub (26) and corresponding permanent magnets
(68) are arranged opposite the coil means (60) on the hub

(28) so that the coil means (60) and the permanent magnets
(68) together form a self-excited electrical generator, and

that for switching on the generator a means (70, 72, 74) for
securing the coil means (60) to the transmission housing (20)

and a current pick-up means are provided.
Bicycle according to claim 11, characterized in that the
current pick-up means is in the form of a spring slip brush

member (64) running on a slip ring (66) fixed to the housing.
Bicycle according to claim 12, characterized in that the
current pick-up means and the means for securing the coil

means (60) comprise a projection (70) of electrically conductive
material on the coil means (60) and an electrically conductive

arm (72) which is mounted in insulated relationship
on the transmission housing (26) and which is adapted to

pivot into a position in which it secures the coil means (60)
and serves at the same time to carry off the electrical current

generated.
Bicycle according to claim 1, characterized in that a
coil means (50) is mounted within the hub (28) beside the

transmission housing (26) on the same coaxially with respect
to the hub (28) and a suitable further coil means (48) is arranged 

opposite the first coil means (50) on the hub (28) so
that both coil means (48, 50) together form a separately excited

electrical generator, wherein a current transmission
means (52, 54) for supplying the further coil means (48) with

excitation current is provided.
Bicycle according to claim 1, characterized in that an
electrical auxiliary motor is mounted within the hub (28) beside

the transmission housing (26) on the same.
