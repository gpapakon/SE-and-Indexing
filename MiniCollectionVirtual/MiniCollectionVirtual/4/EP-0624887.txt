<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ignition device 
for internal combustion engines and, in particular, 
relates to an ignition device for internal combustion 
engines and a distributor which are suitable for use 
under high temperature conditions. JP(U)-B-59-34105(1984) discloses an example of 
conventional devices in which a divided type secondary 
coil bobbin for the ignition coil is formed of a 
thermoplastic synthetic resin. Now, in case of, in particular, an in-distributor 
built-in type and an engine direct mounting type 
simultaneous firing ignition coil, the inner temperature 
of the ignition coil rises extremely high, because the 
same is directly suffered to heat of the engine in 
addition to its self heating. For this reason there 
arises such problem with the conventional secondary coil 
bobbin formed of a thermoplastic synthetic resin that 
dielectric break-down is caused in a high temperature 
region exceeding 150°C between secondary coil layers and 
between a secondary coil high voltage side and the  
 
grounding, which is caused because of reduction of 
insulating property due to covering film damage through a 
local heating of enamel film covering the secondary coil 
by a corona discharge generated at a peeled boundary of 
the secondary coil bobbin in the ignition coil. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
ignition device for internal combustion engines and an 
ignition device mounting type distributor which can be 
used under high temperature conditions and has an 
excellent durability. The above object is achieved by an ignition device 
for internal combustion engines comprising a primary coil 
and a secondary coil which is electrically coupled with 
the primary coil via an iron core and is formed by 
continuously winding a wire conductor over a divided type 
secondary coil bobbin on which a plurality of winding 
grooves are formed, wherein the divided type secondary 
coil bobbin is formed of a thermosetting synthetic resin. Further, an ignition device for internal combustion 
engines which achieves the above object comprises an 
ignition coil having a secondary coil of which coil 
bobbin is formed of a thermosetting synthetic resin and 
two high voltage terminals connected to the secondary 
coil. Still further, an ignition device mounting type  
 
distributor which achieves the above object comprises a 
housing, a high voltage tower portion provided at the 
housing for feeding a high voltage for an ignition plug 
and an ignition coil which is attached to the housing
