<ABSTRACT>
A container for producing popcorns in a microwave oven, characterized 
in that it is constituted starting from two parts (2) 

and (3) made of a heat-resistant plastic material which with-stands 
the temperature prevailing inside the oven, and adopting 

a plantar quadrangular shape, the part (2) having, on its upper 
portion, an opening (4) perimetricaly surrounded by a surface 

occupying the remaining of the face (2), there being on the middle 
lower portion of the side faces, a plurality of ventilation 

perforations or holes (9) and being completed below by a perimetric 
projection (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification refers to 
a container for producing popcorns in a 
microwave oven, the obvious purpose of which is to provide 
a container being capable of withstanding, owing to its own 
characteristics with regard to the material used, the 
temperature prevailing inside the oven, the transformation 
of the grains of corn into popcorns being carried out inside 
said container during its permanence in the oven for a 
predetermined time, with the help, of course, of the 
ingredients necessary for cooking this product, such as an 
adequate amount of salt and oil. This invention is applicable to the industry devoted to 
the manufacture of cooking containers, especially made of a 
plastic material. It is known by the Patent U.S. No. 4.563.561 an utensil 
applicable to grains to be swollen, such as corn grains, 
being usable whitin a microwave since it is built in a 
transparent material for this type of radiation. This 
utensil is constituted by two mutually adaptable 
receptacles, in invested respective positions, the lower or  
 
swollen receptacle having a chamber delimited by downwardly 
converging walls, while the upper receptacle or lid 
possesses a cavity in which interior the swollen grains are 
received, having on its upper base suitable openings to 
evacuate the steam detached by the grains when are swollen. 
These openings are distributed close the upper external 
edge, throughout all the perimeter of the corresponding 
base. When both receptacles are held together the upper 
receptacle open edge becomes adapted to a rising elevation 
and to a perimetral seat provided in the lower receptacle 
open edge, both receptacles having furthermore in their 
faced edges external perimetric flaps, the lower being wider 
than the upper, said flaps becoming into contact when both 
receptacles are together, and having lateral projections in 
faced opposed positions which are used in a manner of 
handles for the manipulation of the ensemble. The mentioned 
receptacles have a frustrumpyramidal form with a 
quadrangular base, and the lower is fitted with a deposit 
for the receipt of a butter portion, being said deposit 
delimited by a lower concave surface and by the side walls, 
departing from the lower part of the deposit a series of 
segments in -the form of ribs, mutually spaced, which 
radially extended to direct the melted butter toward the 
periphery of said deposit. It is also known by the Patent U.S. No. 4.823.863 a 
blower for popcorns suitable to be used within a microwave 
oven, which is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A container for producing popcorns in a microwave 
oven, constituted by an 

upper body (2) and a lower body (3) in which the corn grains 
are deposited, being both mutually adaptable by means of an 

external perimetric projection (10) provided on the upper 
body to surround its open lover edge and a perimetric 

stepping provided on the open upper edge of the lower body 
(3) delimited by an also perimetric internal elevation (11), 

the lower body being fitted with internal depressions (5)in its base, 
characterized in that the upper body (2) has on 

its upper wall a wide opening (4) delimited by a perimetric frame-like 
flap being a constituent part of the upper 

wall, the upper body furthermore having a 
plurality of small size ventilation windows (9), distributed in 

its side walls according to a perimetric line located at 
an intermediate height; in that said depressions (5) of the 

lover body (3) adopt the form of a cross 
configured in prismatic form, being delimited by side walls 

which are downwardly converging and are termined in their 
respective extremes by means of smooth triangular surfaces, 

said depressions (5) 
forming legs and 

being directed from the center of the 
base of the lower body (3) toward the corners of the base, 

and in that the height of the upper body (2) is substantially 
greater than the height of the lower body (3). 
A container according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the upper body (2) has in each of two opposed 

sides at least a protuberance (8) in a sloped upward 
position, which rise from said perimetric projection (10), 

while the lower body (3) has in each of two opposed sides at 
least a tab (6, 6') outwardly extendeding in coincident  

 
positions with respect to those of said protuberances (8) of 

the upper body (2), each tab (6, 6') being provided with a 
transverse opening suitable to receive and house the 

corresponding protuberance (8).
