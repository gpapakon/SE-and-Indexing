<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to processes for local ground treatment, especially the testing and cleaning of a polluted ground in which a sample taken from the ground or polluted liquid arising from the polluted soil layer or polluted ground water is forced to the surface and any treating agent and/or pollution converting agent is previously or subsequently added to the soil layer which is to be treated or is polluted. According to the process of the invention, oblique connecting pipes (5, 6) or a perforated piping system (6) are constructed so as to fit into the upper part of the layer which is polluted or to be treated, e.g. taking up a horizontal position and forming a uniform piping system or the piping system is made up from flow circuits, whereby the polluted liquid and ground water are collected and conveyed further in the system itself or the appropriate part of the flow circuit, in which treatment agent and/or purifying agent or pure water are fed through the aforementioned section or another section of the flow circuit into the polluted ground layer (1).

<CLAIMS>
Process for the local treatment of soils, in
particular examining and cleaning of contaminated soil,

using a delivery (pumping) system comprising pipes
connecting the surface with the contaminated layer (1)

intended to be treated for pumping a treating medium,
particularly cleaning medium to the contaminated layer

and recycling the treating medium and/or the liquid,
containing the contamination to the surface,
characterised in
, that

the delivery (pumping) system contains at least one flow
circuit comprising an underground pipe-system (6) with

perforated, in particular horizontal pipes, said
underground pipe system being guided through and adapted

to the contaminated layer (1) intended to be treated, and
further said flow circuit comprising connecting pipes

(4,5) for pumping and recycling liquid to the layer and
back to the surface, with said connecting pipes being

guided in an oblique angle from said pipe system (6) to 
the surface and being connected to each other through

said pipe system (6).
Process as claimed in Claim 1,

wherein
the contaminated liquid being delivered (pumped) to the
surface will be analysed continuously or

discontinuously.
Process as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2

wherein
the layer (1) intended to be treated is monitored
independently of the pipe-system (6) by means of

observing well (10).
Process as any of the Claims 1 to 3

wherein
the layer (1) intended to be treated will be examined by
means of carotage cable, being installed at least into a

part of the pipe-system (6) and being connected to
surfacial measuring unit.
Process as any of the Claims 1 to 4

wherein
the liquid delivered (pumped) to the surface will be 
cleaned, thereafter the clearwater will be recycled to

the contaminated layer (1).
Process as any of the Claims 1 to 5

wherein
the treating medium comprises bacterial culture or
chemical agents.
