<ABSTRACT>
Angular motion sensor signals (S1, S2) from an inertial integrating rate sensor (10) are provided to a translation device that provides a translated output signal (U1, U2) that is substantially the same as an input sensor signal (S1, S2) translated in frequency by an amount equal to a reference frequency (R1, R2). The translated output signal (U1, U2) is provided to a phase detector (34, 36) that provides a detector output signal (e1, e2) indicative of phase differences between the translated output signal and a feedback signal. The phase detector output signal is provided to a voltage controlled oscillator (42) which provides an oscillator output signal that is related to the phase detector output signal. The voltage controlled oscillator signal is provided to a counter (44) that is capable of providing a count that is representative of a highly resolved measure of angular rotation. In addition, the counter (44) is capable of providing the feedback signal that is related to the variable frequency output signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to angular rate 
sensors and, more particularly, to apparatus and 
techniques for providing high resolution output signals 
representative of increments of angular velocity and/or 
increments of angular rotation. Ring laser gyroscopes or inertial integrating 
rate sensors are generally known, one of which is 
described in US-A-3,373,650. 
The ring 
laser gyroscope described in this patent makes use of two 
quasi-monochromatic beams of light that are generated in 
two opposite directions around a closed loop path about 
an axis of rotation in an optical resonator. Rotation 
about the axis causes the effective path lengths for the 
two beams to change, thus producing a frequency 
difference between the two beams since the frequency of 
oscillation of a laser is dependent upon the length of 
the lasing path. The frequency difference between the two 
beams causes a phase shift between these beams which 
changes at a rate proportional to the rate of change of 
angular rotation; thus, the accumulated phase shift over 
time between the two beams is proportional to the 
integral of the rate of angular rotation. In other words, 
the integrated rate sensor output is representative of 
the integral of the input angular rate. The phase difference between the two 
quasi-monochromatic beams is typically determined using 
a beam combiner. The beam combiner produces an 
interference or fringe pattern which impinges upon a pair 
of photodetectors. The fringe pattern represents the beat 
frequency of the heterodyned optical frequencies of the  
 
quasi-monochromatic beams. This fringe pattern consists 
of a pattern of alternate light and dark bands of light 
which move to the left or right depending on the 
direction of rotation of the gyro or angular rate sensor. 
If these two detectors are positioned one-quarter 
wavelength apart, then two sine waves 90Â° out of phase 
are obtained and their relative phase lead or lag is an 
indication of the direction in which the laser gyroscope 
is rotating, such as shown in US-A-3,627,425. However, at low rotation rates when the 
difference in frequency between the two beams is small, 
the two beams tend to resonate together or "lock-in" so 
that the two beams oscillate at only one frequency. 
Thus, measuring low rotation rates with the gyroscope 
becomes impossible because expected frequency differences 
between the beams, proportional to the rotation rates, do 
not exist at these low rates. To avoid or reduce the effects of lock-in, 
laser angular
