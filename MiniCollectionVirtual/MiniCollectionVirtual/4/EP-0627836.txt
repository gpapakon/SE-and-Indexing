<ABSTRACT>
An enhanced power saving method for operating a battery powered 
handhold communication system, particularly a cordless phone system, and the 

communication system constructed in accordance with the power saving method are 
disclosed. The power saving method comprises an algorithm which divides the standby 

time of the communication system into a scanning mode and a sleep mode of several 
different levels to allow the system to enter the scanning mode intermittently. Each level 

of the sleep mode corresponds to a given length of delay time between two successive 
scanning periods. The communication system enters different levels of the sleep mode 

in accordance with the standby time history. The longer the standby time has passed, 
the longer the sleep time of the level that the system may enter is to cut down the scan 

rate when the system is not used for a long while.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a battery powered handhold 
communication system, such as a cordless phone system and a mobile phone system, 
and in particular to an enhanced power saving method for operating the battery powered 
communication system in an enhanced power saving standby mode in which the receiver 
of the communication system changes the scan rate as a function of the standby time 
and enters a sleep mode if no incoming signal is received or no outgoing signal is 
transmitted in order to save the power consumed by the receiver. The invention is also directed to an enhanced power saving cordless 
communication system which comprises a controller to change the scan rate of the 
receiver as a function of the standby time in order to save the power consumed in the 
standby duration. Prolonging the standby time of a battery powered cordless communication 
system, especially a handhold cordless communication system, is a challenge to the 
communication industry. A handhold cordless communication system comprises in 
general a receiver for incoming signals and a transmitter for outgoing signals. For a 
conventional handhold cordless communication system, its operation is divided as a talk 
mode TM in which both the receiver and the transmitter are active and a standby mode 
in which the transmitter is inactive with the power supplied thereto completely cut off 
and the receiver remains active to scan incoming signals from the surrounding air. For a conventional cordless phone system, the power consumptions of the 
transmitter and the receiver thereof are respectively illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 of the 
attached drawings. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the transmitter consumes no power at all 
under the standby mode. However, as shown in Fig. 2, the receiver takes the same 
amount of power under both the talk mode and the standby mode to maintain itself 
active. As a result, the overall system power consumption of the conventional handhold 
cordless communication system is generally the sum of those of Figs. 1 and 2 and is as  
 
illustrated in Fig. 3. An interpretation of Figs. 1, 2 and 3 indicates that in the talk mode, both 
the transmitter and the receiver consume power, while in the standby mode, only the 
receiver takes power to maintain active. Since the receiver has to be maintained active, 
power supplied thereto cannot be cut off. Such a system requires quite a power 
consumption to maintain the receiver active all the time. Since the incoming signals are 
coming in a random

A power saving method for a cordless communication system wherein the 
cordless communication system comprises a receiver to scan and receive signals from a 

surrounding air, which receiver enters a period of a standby mode when no signal is 
coming in to be received thereby and which is activated to scan the signals from the 

surrounding air in accordance with pre-set scan rates and deactivated for a length of 
preset delay time to reduce power consumption in an alternate fashion within the 

standby mode period, said power saving method comprising: 
   dividing the standby period into a number of sections to define a 

corresponding number of successive time zones; 
   establishing a delay level for each of said time zones, each delay level 

being associated with a delay time period; 
   setting a scan rate for each of said delay levels; 

   continuously allowing the receiver to be activated in accordance with the 
delay level and the scan rate associated with the time zone where the receiver belongs to 

establish a standby time history of the receiver; 
   recording the standby time history and comparing the standby time history 

with the definition of said time zones to determine which time zone the receiver belongs 
to; 

   updating the standby time history to allow the receiver to enter the time 
zone next to the zone that the receiver originally belongs to to scan with the scan rate 

and to sleep for the delay time associated with the next time zone when the original 
time zone is exceeded; and 

   repeating the comparing and updating procedures until being interrupted 
by an attempt to make a communication via the cordless communication system. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the standby period is divided to 
define at least three time zones of which the first one has a highest scan rate and a least 

delay time, the second one has a second highest scan rate and a second least delay time 
and the third one has the lowest scan rate and the greatest delay time.
