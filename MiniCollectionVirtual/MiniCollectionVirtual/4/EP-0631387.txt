<ABSTRACT>
A technique for maintaining a center frequency of 
an input signal at a nominal center frequency. Apparatus 

which implements this technique divides, using a pair of 
bandpass filters (122, 124), the modulation bandwidth of the 

input signal into two halves (half-bands) and measures the 
signal strength of the input signal in each half-band. 

Then, circuitry (126, 128, 130), connected to each filter, 
compares the signal strengths of the signals passing through 

each filter. The circuitry produces a difference signal 
representing a difference between the strength of each 

signal passing through each respective filter. The 
difference signal is used to adjust a frequency of a local 

oscillator signal produced by a local oscillator (112) 
within a tuner (104) such that the center frequency of the 

input signal is maintained by the tuner at the nominal 
center frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus and methods for
performing automatic frequency control in communications
receivers and, particularly for performing automatic
frequency control using split-band signal strength
measurements.In general, a communications receiver receives
transmissions of modulated signals and reproduces
information carried by those signals. Typically, each
modulated signal is allocated a defined channel having a
center frequency and a bandwidth. The modulated signal
within the channel has a center frequency and modulation
bandwidth, i.e., the spectral width of the modulation.
Under user control, the receiver is tuned to a channel from
which the user wishes to receive information. In practice,
such tuning involves initially tuning the receiver to
receive a modulated signal centered at the channel center
frequency. However, in many instances, the modulated signal
is not precisely centered at the center frequency of the
channel. If the modulated signal is not centered within the
channel and the receiver contains an automatic frequency
control circuit, the receiver adaptively retunes itself to
compensate for the frequency offset of the modulated signal.
Consequently, the modulated signal automatically becomes 
centered in the channel. As discussed below, circuitry for
adaptively tuning the receiver is costly and complex.In general, a conventional analog communications
receiver for receiving and demodulating modulated signals
contains a tuner, a demodulator and an automatic frequency
control (AFC) circuit. Typically, the tuner is user
controllable to enable individual channels to be selected
for demodulation. After a channel is selected by the tuner,
the demodulator demodulates the modulated signal within that
channel. The demodulator also detects any frequency offset
of the modulated signal center frequency from the channel
center frequency. The AFC circuit compensates for such
frequency offset. If the offset is not compensated, the
demodulation process is not optimally accomplished.
Consequently, any information thereby reproduced may be
distorted.The input lead of the tuner is typically connected
to a transducer such as an antenna, photodiode, and the
like, to convert electromagnetic energy into an electric
signal. Alternatively, such a transducer may not be used
and a cable transmission may be connected directly to the
input lead of the tuner. For simplicity, I will assume, for
the following discussion, that the receiver is utilized for
over-the-air radio-frequency (RF) broadcasts such
