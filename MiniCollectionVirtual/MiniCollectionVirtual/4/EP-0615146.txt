<ABSTRACT>
A colour wheel comprised of two or more interference 
filters deposited on or bonded to a substrate glass disk without the 

use of a frame or spokes. Filters 32, 34, and 36 preferably 
abut and are typically made from multiple layers of 

materials having different indices of refraction. The 
colour wheel does not require extensive machining or 

balancing, and is optically efficient because the 
duration of single colour light periods is maximized. The 

colour wheel does not have frame or spokes and is 
therefore more aerodynamically efficient resulting in less 

work required to spin it and less wind noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of color visual display systems, more particularly to 
color wheels for such systems. Full color images can be displayed by creating multiple one-color displays of the 
appropriate colors. Often this is done by using filters to create three one-color displays. The 
simplest example involves the use of three independent projection systems, each with its own 
light source and filter. The filtered light from each of these sources is independently modulated 
and projected onto a shared screen. The viewer's eye integrates the three simultaneous color 
images, giving the appearance of colors other than the three displayed. An alternative to three parallel projectors involves sequentally projecting three one-color 
images onto the screen at a rate fast enough to allow the viewer's eye to integrate the three 
successive images. This creates a full-color image with just one light source, modulator, and 
projector. To implement such a color system requires the filters to be switched rapidly between 
the display of each image. Typically this is done by mounting the three filters in a wheel 
configuration using a machined metal or molded plastic frame. The filter wheel, called a color 
wheel, is then spun in front of a white light source to filter out the three desired colors from the 
white light. Color wheels in the prior art have typically been made by holding the three filters in a 
machined aluminum wheel. Because of the forces generated by spinning the wheel, a metal hub 
and rim are needed to keep the wheel intact. Metal spokes run from the hub to the rim along  
 
the joint between the filters to hold the filters in place. The metal wheel must be precisely 
aligned and balanced to ensure the smooth operation of the color wheel. The color wheel described above has several drawbacks due to the construction of the 
color wheel. First, because the system relies on the filtered light being a single color at all 
times, the projection system must not operate during the time it takes for each spoke to cross the 
aperture of the projection system. Therefore, the wider the spokes, the less efficient the display 
system and the dimmer the resulting image. Secondly, the spinning metal spokes create wind 
resistance requiring more power to spin the wheel and generating much more noise. Also the 
cost of the color wheel tends to be high due to the labor involved in building and precisely 
balancing the wheel.  According to one embodiment of the present invention 
there is provided a
