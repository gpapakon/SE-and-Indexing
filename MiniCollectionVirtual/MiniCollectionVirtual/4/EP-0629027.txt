<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a rotating electrical contactor of the type comprising: a first, fixed, housing element (120), a second housing element (130) concentric with the first, fixed, housing element (120) and rotationally movable with respect to it, and a flexible electrical conducting member (140) wound spirally between the fixed housing element (120) and the moving housing element (130), characterised in that: it includes a referencing index (150) placed on the conducting member (140) at an intermediate point between the ends (142, 144) of this member, fixed respectively to the fixed element (120) and the moving element (130), and one of the elements (120, 130) includes a localised window facing the index (150) in a known relative position between the elements (120, 130).
