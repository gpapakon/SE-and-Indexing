<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for reducing the noise level in an integrated circuit with several levels of conductors. The device comprises at least one electric capacitor (1 to 5) linking two power supply lines, whether or not of different conductor levels. The capacitor may be an electric charge storage capacitor, making it possible to meet local demands for electric current in order to reduce the voltage drops on the stray resistors, and/or a capacitor for coupling power supply lines, which makes it possible to conjugate the noise between the power supply lines and to distribute the noise energy over the whole of the circuit.
