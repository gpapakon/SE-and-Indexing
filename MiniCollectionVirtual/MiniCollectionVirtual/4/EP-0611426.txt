<CLAIMS>
Motor vehicle gearing, in particular a multi-speed 
synchronized transmission gearing, in which the gears (1 

and 3 or 2 and 4) associated in each case in an adjacent 
manner with a gear shift packet (28, 29) are not 

successive gears and an operating device (12, 13) as well 
as synchronizing devices are associated with each gear 

shift packet (28, 29), 

characterized in that 
the operating devices (12, 13) are provided with means so 
that the operating devices are operated and controlled 

independently of one another in such a way that the 
synchronizing devices of a plurality of gear shift 

packets (28, 29) are simultaneously loaded. 
Motor vehicle gearing according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the means of each operating device (12, 13) 

comprise an electric motor in conjunction with an 
electronic controller. 
Motor vehicle gearing according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the electric motor is connected to a linear 

device, e.g. a three-dimensional cam mechanism or 
threaded spindle and nut, for converting the rotation of 

the electric motor into a linear gear shift motion for 
operating the gear shift packet (28, 29).
