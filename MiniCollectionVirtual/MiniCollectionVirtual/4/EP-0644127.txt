<ABSTRACT>
A reclosable chewing gum packet, and a blank for 
making that packet. The packet (30) includes a multitude of 

side panels (16a-16e) and a tear strip (14) attached to and 
transversely extending across each of those side panels. 

The tear strip is cut through, adjacent a first end 
thereof, to separate the tear strip into first and 

second sections (14a,14b). The first section of the tear strip is 
torn away from the packet to form a lateral tear line (34), 

separating the packet into a cover (36) and a body (40). When 
this is done, the transverse cut (42) through the tear strip 

prevents the first section of the tear strip from 
tearing the second section of the tear strip away from 

the packet. That second section of the tear strip 
remains attached to the packet and forms a flexible 

hinge (44) connecting the cover of the packet to the body 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
reclosable cartons or packets and to blanks for making 
such cartons or packets; and, more specifically, this 
invention relates to such cartons or packets that are 
well-suited for holding sticks of chewing gum. Conventionally, a chewing gum packet is opened by 
pulling a narrow tear strip that extends around a top 
portion of the packet to separate that top portion from 
the rest of the packet. That top portion is then 
removed, providing access to the individual chewing gum 
sticks in the packet. There are several disadvantages of this 
conventional prior art procedure. First, after the top 
portion of the packet is removed, the chewing gum sticks 
may slide out of the packet and scatter in, for 
instance, the pocket or purse of the person carrying the 
packet. Second, after the chewing gum packet has been 
opened, the chewing gum sticks inside the packet may 
loose water vapor and other molecular ingredients, so 
that the chewing gum sticks, over time, may become dry 
and breakable and loose their flavor and aroma. Prior art chewing gum packets are disclosed, for 
example, in US-A-2,118,849, US-A-1,329,056, and US-A-1,132,781. 
US-A-2,118,849 and US-A-1,329,056 
disclose chewing gum packets having top covers that are 
separated from the bodies of the packages either by 
removing a tear strip or by tearing along a perforated  
 
line. US-A-1,132,781 discloses a chewing gum package having 
a top flap that can be selectively opened and closed. This 
top flap, however, is formed by a separate strip of material 
that is pre-folded and then inserted into the gum package. EP-A-0 456 506 discloses a package intended for 
packaging, for example, detergent. Figure 17 of this 
document shows a blank made from cardboard, corrugated 
cardboard or the like which can be folded to form a generally 
parallelepipedal package. This blank includes four panels 
connected together, the first of which forms a lateral panel, 
the second forms a front or back panel of greater width than 
the first panel, the third forms another lateral panel, and 
the fourth forms a back or front panel; attached to the 
fourth panel is a narrow joining strip which is glued to the 
first panel when the package is folded into shape. In order 
to facilitate removal of a tear-off strip for opening the 
package a tape extends the width of the blank across all four 
panels and the narrow joining strip. This tape is cut 
transversely in two places in the section extending across 
the fourth panel so as
