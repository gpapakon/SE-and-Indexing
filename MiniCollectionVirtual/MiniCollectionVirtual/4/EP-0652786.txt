<ABSTRACT>
This disclosure is directed to the design of a dilatation catheter having two or more associated fluid-carrying tubes (12, 13), the operative or distal end of one (20) of which supplies fluid to inflate an expansible balloon (11) and the operable or distal end of the other (21) of which supplies an injectable dye or contrast enhancing fluid adjacent the proximal end of the balloon (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed generally to intravascular
catheters, and more particularly to the design of a
dilatation catheter having a pair of associated fluid-carrying
tubes, the operative or distal end of one of which
supplies fluid to inflate an expansible balloon and the
operable or distal end of the other of which supplies an
injectable dye or contrast enhancing fluid adjacent the
proximal end of the balloon.Dilatation catheters of the general class of the
present invention are well known and generally described in
references such as the American Journal of Cardiology,
Volume 49, April 1, 1982, pages 1216-1222. They are
basically employed to enlarge constrictions in larger
vessels or arteries, or even other internal cavities by
employing a precisely placed inflatable balloon device to
compress plaque or other obstructing material against the
arterial wall or the outer surface of the cavity of
interest thereby reopening a larger channel for blood flow
or the like. This method of treatment of stenotic
lesions in the vascular system is known as transluminal
balloon angioplasty. The procedure involves the use of an
elongated, flexible, plastic catheter having an inflatable
expander member or balloon proximate its distal tip. The
catheter describes a tubular lumen suitable to conduct an
amount of fluid introduced from without the body to and
from the balloon to accomplish inflation and deflation of
the balloon as required. One such device is illustrated
and described in U.S. Patent 4 762 129 upon which the preamble of
claim 1 is based. The system is
introduced at an appropriate site in the vascular system,
commonly in the femoral artery, and routed through the
system using a guide wire to the site of the lesion of
interest to be treated. Once the deflated balloon is
positioned in the desired relationship to the lesion, the 
appropriate fluid is introduced into the proximal end of
the catheter and flows to inflate the balloon which, in
turn, compresses the stenotic lesion against the wall of
the blood vessel.In order for the balloon to be precisely positioned
with respect to the stenosis to be compressed and the
result easily evaluated, a contrast medium or dye is
utilized to enhance the contrast at the site so that the
scene can be viewed with greater resolution by the operator
of the device. Normally, this involves injecting an amount
of contrast fluid or dye material into the femoral artery
and waiting until the diluted dye makes its way through the
vascular system to the site of the stenotic lesion.

<CLAIMS>
A dilatation catheter comprising:

an expandable balloon (11) having distal and proximal
ends;
a first, relatively long, hollow tube (12) having
distal a
nd proximal ends, and describing a
continuous lumen therebetween (12A), at least one

opening adjacent to the distal end (20)
communicating with the interior of the expandable

balloon (11), and an opening in the proximal end
(17) for receiving fluid from without the

catheter for inflating the balloon (11), the
first tube (12) further extending into and being

sealably connected at the proximal end of the
balloon (11); and
a second, relatively short, hollow tube (14) in parallel
association with the first tube (12), having

distal and proximal ends with openings in the
distal and proximal ends and a lumen extending

therebetween of substantially uniform cross-section
along its length adapted to receive a

guide wire (15) in a sliding fit, the second tube
(14) traversing the interior of the expandable

balloon (11) from the distal end to the proximal
end of the balloon (11) and being sealably 

connected with the first tube (12) to the proximal end of the balloon (11) and to
the distal end of the balloon (11), the second tube (14) terminating at its

proximal end a short distance from the proximal end of the balloon (11) in an
aperture open to the exterior of the catheter;

   characterised in that the dilatation catheter further comprises a third, relatively long, hollow
tube (13) in parallel association with the first tube (12) having distal and

proximal ends with opening (21,24) in the distal and proximal ends, and
describing a continuous lumen (13A) extending therebetween, the opening (21)

in the distal end being a short distance from the proximal end of the expandable
balloon (11) and the opening (24) in the proximal end being accessible from

and adapted to receive a fluid from without the catheter and deliver it for
injection from the distal opening.
The dilatation catheter of claim 1 wherein the
first hollow tube (12) and the third hollow tube (13) are

substantially coaxial.
The dilatation catheter of claim 2 wherein the
first hollow tube (12) is contained within the third

hollow tube (13).
The dilatation catheter of claim 1 wherein the
first and third hollow tubes (12, 13) are juxtaposed

in spaced parallel relation.
The dilatation catheter of claim 4 further
comprising a relatively long hollow tubular member

encasing the first and third tubes (12, 13).
The dilatation catheter of claim 4 wherein the
first and third tubes (12, 13) are formed as separate

parallel lumens contained in a single member.
The dilatation catheter of claim 1 wherein the
second hollow tube (14) is coaxial with respect to the first

hollow tube (12) and wherein the opening (21) in the distal
end of the third hollow tube (13) is adjacent the opening

in the proximal end of the second hollow tube (14).
The dilatation catheter of claim 1 wherein the
second hollow tube (14) is coaxial with respect to the

third hollow tube (13) and wherein the opening (21) in the
distal end of the third hollow tube (13) is adjacent the

opening in the proximal end of the second hollow tube (14).
