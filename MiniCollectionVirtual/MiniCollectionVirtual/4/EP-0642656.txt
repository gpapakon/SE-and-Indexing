<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for recording an IR-image of an object, comprising a focal plane array (FPA) (18) of IR-detectors and an optic (1-7) which images the object on the focal plane IR-detector array. At least one temperature reference (10, 11) is arranged in the beam path to the focal IR-detector array. At least one IR-reference detector (12, 13) is allotted to reference purposes among the IR-detector elements in this array. Each temperature reference is coordinated with at least one of the IR-reference detector elements, so that each of the IR-reference detector elements is impinged upon by radiation deriving essentially solely from one of the temperature references. An IR-detector reference output signal is intended to be produced for each temperature reference. Each IR-reference output signal is intended to set an individual reference level for the output signals from the remaining IR-detector elements in the IR-detector array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement according to the preamble of
Claim 1.Hitherto, IR-cameras have been constructed with optical scanning systems
provided with rotating and/or oscillating scanning components. These systems
scan an object and direct the beam path onto only a few detectors which are
responsive to infrared light, these detectors producing a varying video signal
which can be recorded on a TV-type screen. In recent times, however, a new
technique has been introduced in which image scanning is effected with a focal
plane array of detectors placed in an image plane, instead of using movable
components. According to this new technique, each pixel itself creates an
individual detector element. Although this technique was initially expensive, it
has now begun to reach reasonable price levels. Neither is the technique completely
novel, since a number of FPA-systems are available, although it is primarily
the different detector materials which distinguish from one another. For instance,
the detector elements may be pyroelectrical, Schottky PtSi, InSb, MCT, PbSe,
GaAs, etc. This type of technique is used particularly in military systems, as
described in "JR Focal Plane Arrays Application and System Design", by M.M.
Sirieix in SPIE Volume 865, 19-20 November 1987, Cannes, France.That which primarily distinguishes IR-cameras for civilian use, particularly those
cameras retailed by Applicant's AGEMA INFRARED SYSTEMS AB, from at
least the majority of military systems, is that the military systems solely show a
picture of the temperature distribution of scanned objects, whereas IR-cameras for
civilian use also measure the temperature at all pixels or picture elements.Consequently, an IR-camera intended for civilian use will have higher demands
on absolute temperature accuracy than the military systems. Accordingly, the IR-camera 
has incorporated temperature references which are moved automatically
into the beam path of the detector or the detector elements at least once with each
image and the IR-camera is self-calibrating in accordance with these references.The FPA-systems hitherto presented commercially include no actual temperature
references, and neither can they measure temperature particularly well. On the
other hand, the FPA-systems often include a disc of uniform temperature which
can be brought into the beam path, often automatically at given time points, so as
to enable all of the detector elements to be calibrated to deliver the same output
signal when they look at object points

An arrangement for recording an IR-image of an object, comprising a focal
plane array (FPA) of IR-detectors, an optic which images the object of the focal

plane IR-detector array, 
characterized

detector (12,13; 36,37) is allotted to reference purposes among the IR-detector
elements in said array; each temperature reference is coordinated with at least one

of the IR-reference detector elements, so that each of the IR-reference detector
elements will be impinged upon by radiation which derives essentially solely from

one of the temperature references; an IR-detector reference output signal is
produced for each temperature reference; and in that each IR-reference output

signal sets an individual reference level for the output signals from
the remaining IR-detector elements in the IR-detector array.
An arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the temperature
references are several and have mutually different temperatures arranged in a

predetermined division.
An arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the temperature

An arrangement according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the temperature

pattern, for instance ramp-like or sawtooth-like.
An arrangement according to any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized

in that the IR-reference detector elements (12,13) are integrated detector elements
among the imaging IR-detector elements. 
An arrangement according to Claims 1-4, 
characterized
 in that the IR-reference

elements in the element array.
An arrangement according to any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized

by at least one calibrating unit (17) having a specific temperature and intended for
insertion into the beam path to all IR-detector elements in the IR-detector array

for the purpose of calibrating the arrangement; and in that all IR-detector elements
in the IR-detector array are calibrated against one another when the

calibrating unit is inserted in the beam path, therewith to produce mutually equal
output signals.
