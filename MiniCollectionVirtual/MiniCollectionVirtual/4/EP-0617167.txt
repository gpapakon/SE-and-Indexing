<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for limitation of 
the coating width and/or for prevention of damage 

to the roll ends in coating or surface-sizing of paper 
or of an equivalent web material. In the method, the 

coating agent, such as size, coating paste or equivalent, 
is introduced into the coating device to an 

application zone defined by a coating member (10), 
by a moving base (1), by lateral seals (20), and by 

a front wall (15) and spread onto the moving base 
by means of the coating member (10) loaded against 

the moving base. Into the areas outside the coating 
width, substantially over the width defined by the 

lateral seals and the roll ends, liquid is sprayed onto 
the moving base (1), in its running direction, immediately 

before the coating member (10) or directly 
into the nip between the moving base (1) and the 

coating member (10). The liquid jets are supposed 
to lubricate said nip and to dilute the coating agent 

that has entered into the areas outside the coating 
width. The excess amount of the sprayed liquid is 

collected off to prevent its entering into the 
recirculation of the coating agent, so as to prevent 

the coating agent from being diluted. The invention 
also concerns a corresponding equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for limitation of the coating width and/or for 
prevention of damage to the roll ends in coating or surface-sizing of paper or of an 
equivalent web material, in which method the coating agent, such as size, coating 
paste or equivalent, is introduced into the coating device to an application zone 
defined by a coating member, by a moving base, by lateral seals, and by a front wall 
and spread onto the moving base, such as a roll face or a paper or board web that 
is passed over the roll, by means of the coating member loaded against the moving 
base. The invention also concerns an equipment for limitation of the coating width and/or 
for prevention of damage to the roll ends in coating or surface-sizing of paper or of 
an equivalent web material in a coating device, which comprises an application zone 
defined by a coating member, by a moving base, such as a roll face or a paper or 
board web that is passed over the roll, by lateral seals, and by a front wall, the 
coating member that is loaded against the moving base being fitted to spread and to 
smooth the coating agent, such as size, coating paste or equivalent, which has been 
introduced into the application zone, onto the moving base. In coating and surface-sizing of paper or of an equivalent web material, two alternative 
methods and devices are used commonly, i.e. a blade coater or a bar coater. In 
particular in the surface-sizing technique, bar coaters have been used increasingly in 
recent years, because their usability has proved very good. In coating and surface-sizing, 
a bar coater is used for spreading and smoothing the coating agent onto the 
face of the paper or of an equivalent web material, the coating agent being usually 
applied to the web face by means of an applicator roll. In film size presses, the  
 
coating agent may also be applied directly onto the faces of the size-press rolls, from 
which rolls it adheres in the roll nip to the web running through the nip. As was 
already stated above, either a revolving coating bar or a coating blade can be used 
as the coating member. When the coating agent is applied, e.g., by means of a grooved coating bar onto the 
rolls in a size press, the roll end areas placed outside the web must be doctored 
clean by means of lateral doctors, because otherwise this coating agent remaining in 
the end areas of the rolls would cause considerable splashing in the roll nip. The 
doctoring of the lateral areas has proved very difficult, and it also abrades the roll
