<ABSTRACT>
In a process for cooling a dust-laden raw gas from the gasification of a solid carbon-containing fuel in a pressurised reactor, in which the gas from the reactor is introduced into a quench section to which is applied a quenching medium for direct cooling and thence into cooling section included in a water-vapour circuit and extracted therefrom, in order to improve the cooling after the application of the quenching medium, the gas is extracted from the reactor into a quench pipe with a smaller cross-section than that of the reactor, the gas emerging from the outlet end of the quench pipe is deflected substantially through 180  DEG  and taken against the flow of the gas in the quench pipe through a cooling section surrounding said quench pipe.

Method of cooling a dust-laden raw gas from the gasification of a solid 
carbon-containing fuel in a reactor under pressure, with the gas from the 

reactor being introduced into a quench section that is supplied with a 
quenching medium for a direct cooling, and thereafter being introduced 

into a cooling section that is incorporated in a water-steam circuit, and 
being withdrawn therefrom,
 
characterized in that the gas from the reactor is passed into a quench pipe 

having a cross-sectional area that is smaller than the cross-sectional area 
of the reactor, in that the gas issuing from the discharge end of the quench 

pipe is deflected essentially by 180°, and in that the gas is guided through 
a cooling section that surrounds the quench pipe in a direction of flow 

opposite to the direction of flow of the gas in the quench pipe. 
Method according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the withdrawal of the gas from the cooling section is 

accompanied by deflection thereof. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that additional heat is withdrawn by thermal radiation from 

the gas during the defletion into the cooling section. 
Device for the gasification of a solid carbon-containing fuel in a reactor 
under pressure and for the cooling of the generated hot gas including a 

pressure vessel for accommodating the reactor, a quench chamber that is 
connected to the outlet of the reactor and is supplied with a quenching 

medium, and a cooling device that is connected to the gas output side of 
the quenching chamber and includes at least one heat transfer surface 

that is incorporated in a water-steam circuit and is disposed in the 
pressure vessel,
 
characterized in that the quenching chamber is a quench pipe (7) having a 

corss-sectional area that is less than the cross-sectional area of the 
reactor, in that at the discharge end of the quench pipe there is disposed a  

 
deflection chamber (9) for the 180° deflection of the gas stream that issues 

from the quench pipe, and in that the quench pipe (7) is along a given 
length annularly surrounded by at least one bundle of heat transfer 

surface means (12) through which flows the deflected gas stream, and in 
that at the discharge end of the bundle of heat transfer surface means (12) 

there is formed a gas collection chamber (18) that communicates with at 
least one gas withdrawal conduit (20) that extends through the wall of the 

pressure vessel (1). 
Device according to claim 4
 
characterized in that where the outwardly disposed boundary surface of 

the bundle of heat transfer surface means is freely exposed relative to the 
inner wall of the pressure vessel, the inner wall is provided with a lining 

(21) at least in the region of the bundle of heat transfer surface means 
(12). 
Device according to claim 4
 
characterized in that the bundle of heat transfer surface means is 

disposed in an annular chamber (14) that is delimited toward the inside by 
the quench pipe (7) and toward the outside by an outer cooling wall (11) 

that is disposed at a distance from the inner wall of the pressure vessel 
(1). 
Device according to at least one of the claims 4-6,
 
characterized in that the quench pipe (7) is embodied as a cooling wall. 
Device according to at least one of the claims 4-7,
 
characterized in that the outer diameter of the coolig wall (11) or of the 

bundle of heat transfer surface means (12) approximately corresponds to 
the outer diameter of the reactor, so that a passable space still remains 

toward the inner wall of the pressure vessel.
