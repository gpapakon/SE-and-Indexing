<ABSTRACT>
In order to permit the timely reduction of remaining waste, priority is given to the associated composting of valuable substances of an organic nature from kitchen and garden waste. Central composting by means of large scale installations is generally expensive and the large amount of transportation it entails causes the environment to be polluted. In addition, such works frequently find it difficult to sell their product owing to a lack of trust on the part of potential customers in it (because the raw material is sometimes polluted). In many countries (for example Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany) governments have therefore issued guidelines/regulations which favour composting which is carried out on as decentralised a basis as possible. In addition to the existing small compost installations, this entails a considerable demand for medium-sized installations which are to be operated in a semi-decentralised or decentralised fashion and save space while at the same time being available to users everywhere, which is an advantage in view of the fact that the amount of living space is decreasing. With its large annual capacities, the small amount of space it requires, its large capacity for integration and combination (not requiring permission or permission being granted through a simple channel), universal handling, integrated system for returning percolating water, housing, high oxygen supply levels, natural rotting facilities, all-year-round operation and a high-grade compost product which is produced in a transparent fashion, the pavilion compost installation series is geared towards balancing accounts both ecologically and economically and is designed for the wide range of private, commercial and local authority users.
