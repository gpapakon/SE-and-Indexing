<ABSTRACT>
The invention, in one embodiment, is an apparatus for controlling the roll, pitch, and yaw attitudes of an air or sea vehicle. The apparatus includes an actuator (20) including an actuation plane (22) and an actuation mechanism (24), capable of displacing the actuation plane at three points (26); at least three non-propulsive fins (12); and a linkage (28) between the actuator and each one of the fins, the linkage communicating the actuation plane's displacement to the respective one of the fins.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to non-propulsive fin control in an air or sea
vehicle and, more particularly, to such a method and apparatus using planar actuation.An air or sea vehicle's control system provides a mechanism to control the
vehicle's direction of travel. The directional control may be accomplished by directing
the vehicle to travel with a particular vehicle attitude with respect to the relative
movement through a fluid in which the vehicle is traveling. Typically the control
system, whereby the non-propulsive fins are independently commanded, provides the
attitude control required to traverse a given path.A vehicle's attitude can be divided into roll, pitch, and yaw attitudes. The control
of the vehicle's attitude can be theoretically realized through the use of three fins to
control the vehicle's roll, pitch, and yaw attitudes. Typically, however, four fins are
implemented, and occasionally five or more are used.The number of fins implemented depends on the vehicle's application.
Increasing the number of fins will in turn increase the amount of control force the fins
will provide. However, increasing the fin control force does not necessarily increase the
maneuverability of the vehicle. Increasing the number of fins in a traditional manner
will also increase the weight and complexity of the vehicle. which may offset the
increased control force produced.The vehicle's roll, pitch, and yaw attitudes can be controlled by rotating the fins
in a predetermined fashion to obtain a desired vehicle attitude, regardless of the number
of fins. Typical implementations use a separate actuator for each fin so that each fin may
be commanded independently. The use of separate actuators for each fin has some
undesirable effects. For instance, separate actuators increase vehicle weight, complexity
and the possibility of relative fin rotation error. Minimizing vehicle weight is a high
priority in vehicle design because vehicle mass directly contributes to maneuverability
potential. Slight increases in mass can make significant changes in vehicle agility and/or
range performance. Decreasing vehicle complexity is important from a standpoint of
vehicle reliability and cost. Reduced complexity designs are in general less costly to
produce and operate more reliably than higher complexity designs. Control system
relative rotation error is induced when individual actuators per fin are employed because 
of positional errors associated with each actuator. The
positional errors can corrupt the desired relative
