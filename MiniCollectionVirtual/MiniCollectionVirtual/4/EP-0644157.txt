<ABSTRACT>
A cation-substituted clay mineral obtained by substantially substituting a low-valency metal-ammine complex 
and/or a low-valency metal-amine complex for the interlayer cations of a water-swellable clay mineral. A 

chromatographic packing comprising the above mineral permit a sharp peak to be obtained for a highly unsaturated 
compound and is resistant to a change caused by solvents, thus being usable stably for long.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cation-exchanged clay
mineral, a packing material for chromatography using the same and a
method of producing the same. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an improvement of an exchanging cation thereof.Chromatography is generally used for analysis or separation and
refinement of various substances. Liquid chromatography is divided
largely into adsorption chromatography and partition chromatography
according to the separation mechanism.Partition chromatography is further divided into normal-phase
partition chromatography and reversed phase partition chromatography
according to the polarities of the eluate and the packing material.Most of the packing materials used for adsorption chromatography
and normal phase partition chromatography are totally porous silica gel
packing materials in which macropores and micropores are dispersed
reticulately. Alternatively, inorganic supports such as alumina and
porous glass materials, and porous polymers such as polystyrene-divinyl
benzene, polyvinyl alcohol and polyhydroxy methacrylate are used.
Calcium hydroxide powder, calcium phosphate gel, etc. are used for 
specific purposes.Above-described chromatographic supports (e.g., silica gel)
modified with alkyl groups, such as octadecyl groups, are often used for
reversed-phase chromatography.Other packing materials are also used, for example, packing
materials for cation-exchange liquid chromatography such as silica gel
or a porous polymer with a compound having a sulfonyl group or carboxyl
group combined therewith and packing materials for anion-exchange liquid
chromatography such as silica gel or a porous polymer with a quaternary
ammonium or a diethylamino group combined therewith.All of these packing materials, however, suffer from various
problems. Especially, the discrimination between saturation and
unsaturation is so poor that the discrimination among substances having
similar molecular weights is very difficult. An improvement at this
point has therefore den in strong demand.As a packing material for meeting such a demand, the present
inventors developed a packing material disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 199155/1989.This packing material is a swelling clay mineral with the ions
between layers substantially replaced by cations other than sodium ions,
especially, silver ions. Since this packing material shows a
discrimination between saturation and unsaturation, it is possible to
separate a wide variety of unsaturated compounds according to the
