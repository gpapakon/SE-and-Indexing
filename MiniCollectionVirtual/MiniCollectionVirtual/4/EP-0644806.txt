<ABSTRACT>
A heat sink comprises a thick base plate (1), a plurality of parallel pins (2) running outwardly from the base plate and spaced close to each other to define a labyrinthine air path, and a guide plate (3) in which an axial fan (4) is mounted to direct air parallel to the pins towards the base plate (1) which is mounted on the object to be cooled. The heat sink is produced by solidifying a mould (15) of resin coated sand around a tool (11-14), then withdrawing the tool, then gravity die casting through the mould, then destroying the mould.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MULTIPIN STRUCTURES This invention relates to raultipin structures comprising a plurality of pins (e.g. elongate members or rods), connected at at least one end, and extending longitudinally in a direction (for example parallel one to the other). In a further aspect, this invention relates to heat exchangers including such multipin structures. A further aspect of the invention comprises a method for the manufacture of such multipin structures, and heat exchangers made therefrom.One example of a heat exchanger is a heat sink comprising a structure made of a material with good thermal conductivity (generally a metal), which presents a relatively large surface area, and is placed in contact with an article which it is desired to cool. The heat sink conducts heat away from the portion thereof in contact with the article and onto the large surface area, at which heat is dissipated to the surrounding atmosphere. Heat sinks are widely used in electrical applications, where resistive losses, for example, often generate substantial heat, which may lead to one or more of thermal expansion, cracking, fatigue, chemical reaction, and alteration 

or deterioration in electrical performance of components. Heat sinks may also be used for non-electrical application.The performance of the heat sink depends, amongst other things, on the rate at which heat is removed from the surface area of the heat sink by the surrounding atmosphere and this in turn depends upon motion of the atmosphere; air currents improve the performance of the heat sink.Accordingly, in one aspect, we provide a method of manufacture of a heat sink comprising a plurality of features co-extensive in a first direction, defining air channels generally transverse to said first direction, in which the air channels are such as to render the air flow transverse to said direction generally turbulent, the features being interconnected by means for transmitting heat thereto. For example, the interconnection means may be a plate connecting the heat sink to the article to be cooled. The features may for example be pins. 

A turbulent air flow is much more efficient at dissipating heat than a laminar flow, and so this has a high efficiency.In a preferred embodiment, there may be provided means for guiding air currents to follow a path transverse to said first direction; for instance, the guide means may be a plate or plates transverse to the direction of the features.The heat sink may be adapted for cooperation with means for generating an air current to the
