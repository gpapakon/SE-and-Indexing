<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an apparatus (1) having at least one battery (12, 13) which is fitted to a printed circuit board (14), the printed circuit board (14) has supporting regions (23, 24, 25, 26) which can be broken off said printed circuit board (14) and to which solder tabs (19, 20, 21, 22), which project from the terminals (15, 16, 17, 18) of the battery (12, 13), are permanently connected via one solder joint (27) in each case. In this case, each supporting region (23, 24, 25, 26) of the printed circuit board (14) is surrounded by the rest of the printed circuit board (14) all round and an orifice (28, 29, 30, 31), which partially surrounds the relevant supporting region (23, 24, 25, 26) is provided between each supporting region (23, 24, 25, 26) and the rest of the printed circuit board (14), and each supporting region (23, 24, 25, 26) is connected to the rest of the printed circuit board (14) via a connecting section (40, 41, 42, 43) of the printed circuit board (14), which connecting section is located between the two ends (32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39) of one orifice (28, 29, 30, 31).

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (1) having a printed circuit board (14) and at least one 
battery (12, 13) mounted on the printed circuit board (14), which battery is intended for 

powering the apparatus (1) and has two terminals (15, 16, 17, 18), each provided with a 
solder lug (19, 20, 21, 22) which is fixedly connected to a mounting portion (23, 24, 

25, 26) of the printed circuit board (14) by means of a solder joint (27), which 
mounting portions (23, 24, 25, 26) of the printed circuit board (14) can be severed from 

the remainder of the printed circuit board (14) to enable the at least one battery (12, 13) 
to be removed from the apparatus (1), characterized in that each mounting portion (23, 

24, 25, 26) of the printed circuit board (14) is surrounded by the remainder of the 
printed circuit board (14), and an opening (28, 29, 30, 31) is formed between each 

mounting portion (23, 24, 25, 26) and the remainder of the printed circuit board (14), 
which opening partly surrounds the relevant mounting portion (23, 24, 25, 26), and 

each mounting portion (23, 24, 25, 26) is connected to the remainder of the printed 
circuit board (14) by a connecting portion (40, 41, 42, 43) of the printed circuit board 

(14), which connecting portion is situated between the two ends of each opening (28, 
29, 30, 31), which mounting portions (23, 24, 25, 26), which are each situated within 

an opening (28, 29, 30, 31), can each be severed from the remainder of the printed 
circuit board (14) substantially at the location of a connecting portion (40, 41, 42, 43), 

preferably by means of a tool (44). 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that each opening 
(28, 29, 30, 31; 28) extends transversely of the longitudinal axis (12a, 13a) of a battery 

(12, 13; 12), and the two ends (32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39; 32, 33) of two openings 
(28, 29, 30, 31; 28) each time face one another, which openings partly bound two 

mounting portions (23, 24, 25, 26; 23) to which the two solder lugs (19, 20, 21, 22; 
19) of a battery (12, 13; 12) are each fixedly connected by means of a solder joint (27) 

(Figs. 2, 3, 4; 5; 6; 7; 8). 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that each 
opening (28, 29, 30, 31; 28) is substantially C-shaped (Figs. 2, 3, 4; 5; 6; 8; 9; 10).  

 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that each mounting 
portion (23, 24, 25, 26; 23) is rectangular in shape, and each opening (28, 29, 30, 31; 

28) consists of straight parts (Figs. 2, 3, 4; 9).
