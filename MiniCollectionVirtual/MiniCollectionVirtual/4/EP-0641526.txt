<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shoe made of high-quality natural materials and a method for making such a shoe, the shaft 1 of which, made of leather tanned using vegetable products, is connected to an insole 2 made of natural materials such as leather, cork etc. and fastened to an outsole. To produce a shoe without using adhesives, the shaft 1 is according to the invention bent over outwards at its edge 4 and sewn together with the edge 5 of the insole 2. The edges 4 and 5 sewn together are inserted into an inner groove 12 of a lateral bead 11 on the outside wall of the outsole 3 and the bead 11 is sewn together with the edges 4 and 5 of the shaft 3 and the insole 2 lying in the groove 12.

A method of making a shoe having an upper (1) of 
vegetable-tanned leather connected to an insole (2) 

made of natural material such as leather, cork or the 
like and fastened to an outsole (3), an edge (4) of the 

upper (1) being bent outwards and the outwardly bent 
edge (4) of the upper (1) being sewn to the edge (5) of 

the insole (2),
 
characterised in that
 
the sewn-together edges (4, 5) are inserted into an 

inner groove (12) in a lateral bead (11) on the outer 
wall of the outsole (3) and
 
the bead (11) is sewn to the edges (4, 5) of the upper 

(3) and the insole (2) in the groove (12). 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the edges (4, 5) and/or the groove (12) are coated 

with liquid pitch before being sewn together. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the upper (1) and the insole (2) are sewn with 

a natural hemp thread coated with pitch. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the bead (11) is sewn to the 

edges (4, 5) with natural hemp thread coated with 
pitch.  

 
A shoe having an upper (1) made of vegetable-tanned 
leather and connected to an insole (2) of 

natural material such as leather, cork or the like and 
fastened to a natural latex outsole (3), the upper (1) 

having an outwardly projecting edge (4) which is 
connected to the edge (5) of the insole (2),
 
characterised in that
 
a lateral bead (11) is integrally formed on the outer 

wall of the outsole (3) and defines an inner groove 
(12) and
 
the interconnected edges (4, 5) of the upper (1) and 

the insole (2) are disposed in the groove (6) and the 
upper (1) and the insole (2) are secured to the outsole 

(1) by an outer seam (13) through the bead (7) and the 
edges (4, 5). 
A shoe according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the upper (1) and the insole (2) are interconnected by 

a peripheral seam (7).

characterised in that
 the edges (4, 5) of the upper (1) 
and of the insole (2) disposed in the groove (12) are 

coated with liquid pitch.
