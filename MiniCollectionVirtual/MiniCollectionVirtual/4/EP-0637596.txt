<ABSTRACT>
Copolymers of vinyl aromatic monomers and propoxylated allyl alcohols having 
an average of 2 or less oxypropylene groups are disclosed. The copolymers, which 

have hydroxyl numbers of 80-260 mg KOH/g and number average molecular weights 
from 500-3500, are particularly useful for polyurethanes, alkyd resins and coatings, 

melamine-based coatings, and unsaturated polyester resins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to copolymers made from vinyl aromatic monomers and 
low molecular weight propoxylates of allyl alcohol. The copolymers, which have 
hydroxyl and olefin functionalities, are resinous polyols that are particularly useful for 
polyurethanes, alkyd resins and coatings, melamine coatings, and unsaturated 
polyesters. Allyl alcohol, which is made commercially by isomerizing propylene oxide, is 
widely used to make allyl ether and allyl ester derivatives for pharmaceuticals, 
fragrances, and chemical intermediates. Allyl alcohol advantageously features both 
hydroxyl and olefin functional groups; however, because it is flammable and highly 
toxic, allyl alcohol must be handled carefully. For many applications, propoxylated allyl 
alcohols, i.e., reaction products of allyl alcohol and an equivalent or two of propylene 
oxide, are favorable replacements for allyl alcohol because they have the same 
functional groups (and similar reactivity), but are less volatile and less toxic. Allyl alcohol copolymerizes with vinyl aromatic monomers such as styrene 
(See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,894,938 and 2,940,946). Because of the large 
reactivity difference between the monomers, the process is run with a large excess of 
allyl alcohol; unreacted allyl alcohol is recovered by distillation and is then recycled to 
the polymerization reactor. The resulting styrene/allyl alcohol copolymers are used in 
a variety of products, including polyesters, fatty ester emulsions, and uralkyds. The  
 
insolubility of styrene/allyl alcohol copolymers in polyether polyols limits their 
usefulness in polyurethane foams. Hult and Johansson (J. Polym. Sc., Part A, Polym. Chem. Ed.29 (1991) 9) 
polymerized styrene in the presence of up to 12 mole percent of ethylene glycol 
monoallyl ether or propylene glycol monoallyl ether, and concluded that allyl ethers do 
not copolymerize with styrene, but inhibit styrene polymerization. Copolymers of vinyl aromatic monomers and higher molecular weight polyether 
polyols containing unsaturation are known. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,823,201 
(Pizzini et al.) teaches graft copolymer dispersions made by reacting vinyl monomers 
with polyether polyols having functionalities of 2 to 6, preferred equivalent weights of 
250 to 5000, and unsaturations of 0.10 to 0.70 meq/g. U.S. Patent No. 4,264,755 
(Cross) teaches hydroxy-functional vinyl copolymers produced by copolymerizing 
styrene with a mono- or diallyl ether of a saturated aliphatic polyol having a hydroxyl 
functionali
