Device for inhaling a powdery, micronized and formulated,
pharmacologically active drug in the form of

an aerosol, comprising of a supply container (3) for
the drug, which supply container is completely or

partially closed off at its lower end by a rotatable
or displaceable, manually actuated metering plate

(4) with at least one depression (5) for the
repeated reception and delivery of a predetermined,

reproducible quantity of the drug from the container
(3), and a mouthpiece (14) for inhaling, upstream of

which a dispersing chamber (12) is connected,
characterized in that - seen in the flow direction -

an acceleration channel is arranged ahead of the
dispersing chamber (12), which acceleration channel

(8) partially covers the metering plate (4) with
part of its longitudinal surface and opens out

tangentially into a cylindrical dwell-time chamber
(9) and in that the dwell-time chamber (9) is

connected via a central outlet (10) of smaller
diameter than the cylindrical dwell-time chamber (9)

to a circular discharge chamber (11) which the
dispersing chamber (12) adjoins tangentially.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that
a diffuser (13) is connected upstream of the outlet

aperture (15) in the mouthpiece (14) to delay the
aerosol emerging from the dispersing chamber (12). 
Device according to Claims 1 to 2, characterized in
that the acceleration channel (8) can be closed by

an exhalation barrier in the form of an elastic
valve flap (17) which opens during inhalation and

releases the aerosol flow.
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that
the valve flap is constructed as a volute spring

(17) which simultaneously covers and closes the
acceleration channel (8) and the depressions (5) in

the metering plate (4).
Device according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the container (3) has a kidney-shaped cross-section,

the side walls being vertical or being
constructed at a maximum inclination of 30Â° to the

vertical plane.
Device according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that a partial area of the metering plate (4)

partially closes off the lower region of the acceleration
channel (8).
Device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the depressions (5) in the metering plate (4)

have a rectangular, oval or circular contour, the
greatest width of the depressions being smaller than

or equal to the width of the supply container (3).
Device according to Claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that there is a desiccant in a separate receptacle

in the reservoir lid (19) in the container (3) above
the bulk of the drug.
