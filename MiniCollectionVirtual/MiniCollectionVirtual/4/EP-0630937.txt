<ABSTRACT>
Compositions containing polyacrylate rubbers having dual curing sites are 
cured using an improved curing system comprising an alkali metal of a long chain 

carboxylic acid, a tertiary amine having a two methyl groups and a longer chain 
alkyl group, and a disubstituted urea. The compositions are shelf stable, have a 

high degree of scorch safety and cure rapidly at curing temperatures without 
adversely affecting the compression set of the cured article.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method for curing 
compositions containing a polyacrylate rubber having dual curing sites and to the 
cured compositions so obtained. In particular, it relates to curable polyacrylate 
rubber compositions which contain a novel curing system making those 
compositions more resistant to scorch during processing without adversely affecting 
the compression set of the cured compositions. Polyacrylate rubbers having dual cure sites, when cured, exhibit good 
weatherability, high temperature serviceability and resistance to oil. Such rubbers 
are particularly suitable for use as gaskets, seals, packings, belts and hoses, 
particularly under-the-hood in automobiles, and for out-of-door uses such as 
weather stripping. Various curing systems for compositions containing polyacrylate rubbers 
having dual cure sites are taught by Morris, U.S. Patents Nos. 3,910,866, 
3,912,672 and 3,919,143. However, articles fabricated from such compositions 
may not be completely cured and may charge their properties during normal use. 
It is apparent that fabricated articles, depending on their intended uses, as required  
 
to meet certain specifications, and changes in properties which take the articles out-of-specification 
would be unacceptable. Such changes can generally be avoided by 
adding a post-curing step when the articles are being fabricated. However, the 
post-curing step can be very time consuming. Wolf, U.S. Patents Nos. 5,008,345 and 5,081,194, teaches a no-post-cure 
method for curing compositions containing polyacrylate polymers having dual cure 
sites, particularly halogen and carboxyl cure sites, using a metallic acid salt and an 
ammonium or phosphonium quaternary salt as the curing system. The 
compositions are shelf stable prior to curing and give products having good 
compression set when cured. Scorch is the cross-linking which occurs during processing of a curable 
system prior to curing and is a problem encountered with reactive curing systems. 
A retarder can be added to the curable system to retard search, and De Marco, 
U.S. Patent No. 5,079,304 teaches using a substituted urea as the retarding agent 
with the acid salt and quaternary salt curing system of Wolf. However, those 
curable compositions generally have insufficient scorch safety for use in high speed 
injection molding. Curable compositions exhibiting improved resistance to scorch, but where 
compression set of the cured compositions is not adversely affected are required 
for high speed
