 PREPARATION BY FLOTATION OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE ALIPHATIC CARBOXYLIC ACIDSField of InventionThis invention relates to an improvement in a process for the preparation optically active carboxylic acids and the esters thereof. More particularly this inventio relates to an improved process for the preparation of aliphatic carboxylic acids an the esters thereof by adding to a mixture of the diastereomeric salts of such material an inert liquid that has a density less than the density of the mixture and the separating the diastereomeric salts.Background of the InventionResolution of racemic aryl-substituted aliphatic carboxylic acids has bee described in the literature. Kaiser et al., J. Pharm. Sc Vol. 65, No. 2, 269-27 (February 1976) formed the S(-) α-methy.benzylamine salt of S( + )-ibuprofen, remove it from the reaction mixture by filtration, and recrystallized it from isopropanol an then from methanol. After acidifying the 3N aqueous sulfuric acid and extracting wit ether, S( + )-ibuprofen was obtained, m.p. 50-52, [α]D +57*, with 95% optical purit as determined by GLC analysis. Cox et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then. Vol. 232, N 3, 636-643 (March 1985), using the Kaiser et al. method, were able to obtain an S( + ibuprofen preparation which was 99% S isomer and 1% R iso er (w/w). Other methods of separating the enantiomers of racemates can be effected b preparing a salt of the acid with an alkaloid or similar resolving agent such cinchonidine, then separating the products by fractional crystallization from a solve in which the salt of the dextrorotatory isomer is less soluble. The ( + )-salt can the be acid cleaved to yield pure enantiomer. See, for example, U. S. Patent No.4,209,63 issued June 24, 1980, and U. S. Patent No. 3,637,767 issued January 25, 1972, whic relate to resolution of naproxen and related compounds.U. S. Patent No. 5,015,764 discloses and claims a process for increasing th amount of the desired enantiomer obtained from a racemic mixture of Cj to C6 linea or branched aliphatic carboxylic acid or ester thereof. The process comprises: (i forming a salt solution comprising the racemic mixture of the C>. to C6 linear 

branched aliphatic carboxylic acid or ester thereof and an organic or inorganic base; (ii) treating said salt solution with a chiral organic nitrogenous base having a base strength no stronger than said organic base, inorganic base or mixtures of an organic base and an inorganic base; (iii) precipitating from the reaction solution produced in the treatment of step (ii) the less
