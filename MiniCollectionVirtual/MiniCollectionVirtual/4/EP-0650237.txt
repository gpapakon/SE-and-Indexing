<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separating tool
for separating a multi-core ribbon fiber with a plurality
of optical fibers arranged in a plane and integrated with
a common coating.As a separating tool capable of separating a
multi-core ribbon fiber, one in which two boards are
coupled to each other to be openable is known (Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 3-213804).However, the conventional separating tool merely
divides a multi-core ribbon fiber into two portions and
cannot separate it into three portions having arbitrary
numbers of optical fibers, or into single-core optical
fibers. A ribbon cable splitting device is known from US-A-4
179 964 and comprises an opposing pair of slitting elements
having a number of equally specially spaced teeth brought
together in an interlaced fashion to separate individual
conductors of a similarly spaced ribbon cable. The shape,
spacing and quantity of teeth on each of the splitting
elements may be varied to accommodate various sizes of ribbon
cable for splitting or subsequent connection to the cable
connectors, circuit boards or terminals. In particular, the
known device has cutting elements shaped to engage the wires,
cut the material joining them together and space the cut
sections so as to separate each individual insulation covered
electrical wire from the adjacent wires by means of the
separating and spacing elements having the cutting elements.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
provide a separating tool capable of separating a multi-core
ribbon fiber into arbitrary numbers of optical fibers in
various divisional states.This object is solved in accordance with the present
invention by a separating tool comprising the features of
claim 1. Detailed embodiments are described in the dependent
claims.According to the present invention, there is provided a
separating tool for separating the multi-core ribbon fiber
with a 
plurality of optical fibers arranged in a plane and
integrated with a common coating, into single-core
optical fibers, comprising a fiber container such as fiber
accommodating means for containing or accommodating the
multi-core ribbon fiber in an accomodating or containing area, a fiber
holder such as fiber holding means for holding the
multi-core ribbon fiber in the containing area, a cutter
such as scratching means for forming a scratch on a
surface of the common coating of the multi-core ribbon
fiber held by the fiber holder, an arrangement holder such
as arrangement defining means for detachably holding the
cutter or
