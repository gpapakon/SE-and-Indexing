<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-optically readable device is used to identify an article to which it is attached. The device may form a part of an optically readable bar code, the optically readable portion providing the location of the magneto-optically readable portion. The device comprises a transparent substrate material such as polycarbonate film upon which is deposited an optical coupling layer, a magneto-optic layer, a protective layer and a reflection layer. The device may be bonded to any convenient material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to identification and information storage 
systems, and more particularly to bar code systems utilising a combination of 
optical and magneto-optical methods of information storage. It is now commonplace to use optically scanned bar codes to identify 
articles upon which the bar code is printed, embossed, engraved or otherwise 
applied. In a typical application, such as the identification of products being 
sold in a supermarket, a plurality of bars having one of two possible widths are 
printed onto the merchandise according to a predetermined code in order to 
represent a combination of alphanumeric characters. An example of such a 
code is the USS Code 39 shown in figure 1, where two alphanumeric 
characters are encoded using combinations of bars having one of two possible 
widths according to the binary representations indicated in the figure. These bar codes are typically read by a laser scanning device, or light 
pen which passes over the bar code, the light reflected therefrom being detected 
by a sensor which converts the reflected light intensity pattern generated into 
a binary code. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that in order to provide unique 
identification to more than several thousand articles, the number of bars, and 
the length of the bar code will have to increase. Thus, a fundamental problem 
with these bar codes is the limited quantity of information which may be stored 
in a given area. A further limitation is that they are generally printed 
permanently on the article, and there is no possibility of conveniently updating 
the information carried thereon.  
 It is known in the field of disk drives and other magnetic recording 
media to use a magnetic layer on a substrate to record binary data patterns into 
the magnetic layer which may be read by a suitable means, and also, commonly 
may be written to to erase and/or update the information stored therein. WO-A-9 010 916 discloses a card having an erasable 
recording strip made from a magneto-optical material. 
The features in the preamble of claim 1 are known 
from this document. It is an object of the present invention to provide an identification and 
information storage device which is optically readable and which is further 
capable of storing and/or reading substantial additional data using magneto-optic 
techniques. According to the present invention there is provided an identification and 
information storage device for attachment to an article to be identified, 
said device
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An identification and information storage device (20,20',20") for attachment to an 
article (28) to be identified, said device comprising a magneto-optical strip (24) formed on a substrate (22) 

and attached to the article, said magneto-optical strip being adapted to store first 
information readable by the reflecting and modifying of the polarization state 

of a light beam directed thereon, characterised in that the storage device 
includes an optically detectable pattern portion comprising an optical bar code (30) 

for storing second information relating to the identification of the article, and 
in that the magneto-optical strip is positioned in a known location relative to the 

optical bar code (30) such that on identification of information represented by the bar code, the location 
of the magneto-optical strip can be determined. 
An identification and information storage device as claimed in claim 1 
in which the position of the magneto-optical strip is determined by decoding the 

bar code to provide a location relative to the bar code. 
An identification and information storage device as claimed in claim 1 
in which the position of the magneto-optical strip is in a fixed relationship to 

the start and/or stop characters of the bar code. 
An identification and information storage device as claimed in claim 1 
in which the bar code also identifies the presence of the magneto-optical strip, 

the location of the magneto-optical strip then being predetermined 
relative to the start or stop characters of the bar code. 
An identification and information storage device as claimed in claim 1 
in which the magneto-optical strip is located immediately below one of the bars 

in the bar code.  
 
An identification and information storage device as claimed in any one 
of claims 1 to 5 in which the device is formed on a flexible tape. 
An identification and information storage device as claimed in claim 6 
in which a plurality of the devices are formed in a continuous manner on an 

elongate strip. 
An identification and information storage device as claimed in any one 
of claims 1 to 7 in which the device comprises multiple layers deposited in the 

order of a first transparent polycarbonate substrate (22), a dielectric oxide or nitride 
optical coupling layer (23), a magneto-optic layer (24), a protective dielectric layer (25), a 

mirror coating layer (26), and an adhesion layer (27) for adherence to the surface of an 
article (28).
