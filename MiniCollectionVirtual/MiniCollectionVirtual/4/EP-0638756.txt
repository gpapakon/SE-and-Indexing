<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises a clamp (1) composed of two articulated half-shells (10, 11) designed to trap and retain at least one tube (t1, t2), one (10) of the shells being secured to a baseplate (4) which is equipped with a member (41) for fastening to the support (S); in accordance with the invention, the device includes two vibration-damping means such as linings made of an elastomeric material which provide double acoustic filtration between the tube (t1, t2) and the support, a first means (2, 3) being interposed between the tube and the shells, while a second means (5) is interposed between the shell (10) and the baseplate (4).

Device for mounting a pipe on a support, which 
comprises a clamp (1) composed of two hinged shells (10, 

11) capable of gripping around the pipe and retaining it, 
one (10) of these shells, called the fixed shell, being 

fastened to a base (4) provided with a member (41) for 
attachment to the said support (S), the device including 

two vibration-damping means ensuring double acoustic 
filtering between the pipe and the support, a first means 

(2, 3) being inserted between the pipe and the shells 
(10, 11) while a second means (5) is inserted between the 

fixed shell (10) and the base. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the said vibration-damping means are masses (2, 3; 

5) of elastomeric material, the masses (2, 3) making up 
the first means having gutter-shaped half-cavities that 

complement a half-section of the pipe. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the two shells (10, 11) and the base (4) are 

elements made of moulded thermoplastic to which the 
masses (2, 3; 5) made of elastomeric material are added 

by overmoulding. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the two shells (10, 11) are made from a 

single piece having a deformable region (12) forming the 
articulation hinge of the shells. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the two shells (10', 11') are separate 

pieces connected to each other by an articulated catching 
system (13, 14).  

 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that it includes snap-fastening members (110, 

101) capable of automatically locking the clamp in the 
closed positio
n. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 6, characterized 
in that the elastomeric mass (5) making up the 

second vibration-damping means is in the form of a layer 
having a substantially constant thickness, one of the 

faces of which adheres to the fixed shell (10) and the 
other to the base (4). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the base (4) consists of a plate, the external face 

(40) of which is slightly concave such that, when attaching 
it to a plane support (S), it is subjected to a 

slight bending stress. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the member for attaching the base (4) to 

its support (S) consists of a split frustoconical stud 
(41) capable of snap-fastening in a hole in the support. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 9, characterized 
in that the elastomeric masses (2, 3) making up 

the first vibration-damping means comprise several 
parallel cavities (21-31, 22-32), each shaped so as to 

retain a pipe (t
1
, t
2
).
