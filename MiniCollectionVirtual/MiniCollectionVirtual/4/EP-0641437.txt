<ABSTRACT>
A method of testing for a malignant or pre-malignant condition of the cervix by examination of a cervical cell sample, in which the test is performed on a fraction of the sample consisting predominantly of epithelial cells, which have been separated by a buoyant density method such as a discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. Following separation of the epithelial cells the cells are tested for an abnormal level of an enzyme associated with proliferating cells. Typically, the enzyme tested for is one selected from the group consisting of pentose phosphate shunt enzymes, ornithine decarboxylase, thymidine kinase, and ribonucleotide reductase, e.g. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and/or 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the detection of malignant
and pre-malignant conditions of the uterine cervix and
more particularly to test procedures based on
examination of cell samples derived by cervical smear.Cancer of the cervix is a world-wide problem and in
some countries a major cause of death by cancer in
women. In its early and pre-malignant condition, known
as cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN grades 1 to
3), the treatment of the disease is safe and
successful. This emphasises the importance of early
and accurate diagnosis.The standard procedure for detection of abnormal cells,
malignant or pre-malignant, is the Papanicolaou test,
commonly known as the Pap-test. It was introduced in
the 1940s and has to date never been subjected to any
major clinical trial to test its accuracy and
reliability as an indicator of early lesions of the
uterine cervix. However, epidemiological evidence
suggests strongly that there are disturbingly high
error rates associated with this test (Mitchell &
Medley, The Lancet, 1991, 337, 265-267). The methodology
consists of taking samples of material from the uterine
cervix and smearing this onto a glass microscope slide
followed by a staining procedure. The major criticisms
are that the method relies on optimum sampling and
experienced but subjective diagnosis by the cytologist.
The test involves tedious microscopic examination
carried out for long periods which introduce boredom
and consequential errors. Above all, the method is not
quantitative. Alternative approaches have been devised 
which include measurements based on DNA staining and
estimation of degrees of aneupolidy but many of these
methods are time-consuming and depend on sophisticated
instrumentation for diagnosis, thus preventing an obstacle
to automation.It is an object of the present invention to provide a test
for the medical conditions specified above which is more
accurate and reliable than the existing Pap-test.It is a further object of this invention to provide a test
of the foregoing kind which enables a quantitative estimate
to be made of the condition of the patient under test.It is a still further object of this invention to provide
a test of the foregoing kind which is amenable to automated
procedures.The present invention comprises a method of testing for a
malignant or pre-malignant condition of the cervix by
examination of a cervical smear, which comprises selecting
a fraction of the smear consisting predominantly of
squamous epithelial cells and examining the selected
fraction to

<CLAIMS>
A method of testing for a malignant or pre-malignant
condition of the cervix by examination of a cervical smear,

which comprises selecting a fraction of the smear
consisting predominantly of squamous epithelial cells and

examining the selected fraction to determine
characteristics indicative of the said malignant or pre-malignant

condition.
A method according to claim 1, in which separation is
effected by density gradient centrifugation.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, in which the
separated fraction is, or corresponds to, the fraction of

density range from about 1.035 to about 1.055 g/ml as
measured in a Percoll density gradient.
A method according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the
separated cells are further purified by gradient

centrifugation.
A method according to any of the preceding claims, in
which the test is performed on intact cells.
A method according to claim 5, which comprises the
quantitative estimation of a marker formed in or taken up

by the cells.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, in which
the test is performed on lysed cells.
A method according to any of the preceding claims, in
which the test is for an abnormal level of an enzyme

associated with proliferating cells.
A method according to claim 8, in which the enzyme 
tested for is one selected from the group consisting of

glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate
dehydrogenase, ornithine decarboxylase, thymidine kinase,

and ribonucleotide reductase.
A method according to claim 8 or 9, which comprises
also measuring the level of an enzyme which is repressed

in the condition tested for and determining the ratio of
the levels of the two respective enzymes.
A method according to claim 10, in which the repressed
enzyme is catalase or xanthine oxidase.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, which
comprises subjecting the smear to discontinuous gradient

centrifugation, harvesting cells corresponding to combined
fractions of cells having densities within the range 1.035

to 1.055 g/ml as measured in a Percoll gradient, counting
and then lysing the harvested cells, determining the

amounts in the lysate of two enzymes one of which is
enhanced and the other repressed in the condition under

test, and calculating the ratio of the amounts of the two
enzymes.
A reagent kit for use in the detection of a pre-malignant
or malignant condition of the cervix by testing

a cervical smear, said kit comprising reagent material for
separating squamous epithelial cells from the smear, a

substrate for an enzyme which is present at an increased
level in the condition tested for, a cycling electron

acceptor for the enzyme, and a final electron acceptor
which upon reduction provides a measurable indication which

correlates with the level of said enzyme present in the
smear.
A reagent kit according to claim 13, comprising
separate solutions of gradient materials to provide a 

suitable density range for a discontinuous gradient, or dry
materials for reconstitution as such solutions.
A reagent kit according to claim 14, comprising
