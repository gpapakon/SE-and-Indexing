<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process
cartridge and an image forming apparatus to which the
process cartridge is detachably mountable.The image forming apparatus includes a laser
beam printer, LED printer, an electrophotographic
copying machine, a facsimile machine and a word
processor, for example.In an image forming apparatus such as a
printer, a uniformly charged photosensitive drum is
selectively exposed to light so that a latent image is
formed, and the latent image is visualized by toner
into a toner image, which in turn is transferred onto
a recording material. In such an apparatus,
maintenance operations for various parts have to be
performed by an expert service man with the result of
inconveniences on the user side.In view of this, a photosensitive drum, a
charger, a developing device and a cleaning device or
the like are unified into a cartridge. In this case,
by loading the cartridge into a main assembly of the
image forming apparatus by the user, replenishment of
toner, exchange of parts such as image bearing member
having reached the ends of service lives, are
accomplished, thus facilitating the maintenance 
operations (process cartridge system). The process
cartridge system is disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos.
3,985,436, 4,500,195, 4,540,268, 4,627,701 and so on.With such a system, in order to provide high
quality images, reliable electric connection
established between the process cartridge and the
image forming apparatus, has been desired. U.S.
Patent No. 4,591,258 which has been assigned to the
assignee of this application, has proposed that a
contact for supplying voltage from the main assembly
to a charger and a contact for supplying a voltage
from the main assembly to a developing device, are
disposed adjacent the same side as for receiving a
driving force. In this structure, the photosensitive
drum is grounded through a drum shaft. With this
structure, when the process cartridge is inserted into
the main assembly of the image forming apparatus along
an axis of the photosensitive drum, mechanical
connection for drive transmission and electrical
connection between the main assembly and the process
cartridge, are assuredly established. These
structures are practically very effective in the case
of a process cartridge which is mounted in a direction
along the axis of the photosensitive drum to the main
assembly of the image forming apparatus. Patent document JP-A-63-004253 describes a
cartridge which is arranged to be located with an
openable cover of a main assembly of an image
</DESCRIPTION>
