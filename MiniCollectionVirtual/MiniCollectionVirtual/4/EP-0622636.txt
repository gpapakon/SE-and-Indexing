<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve accuracy of memory access time measurements, 
a preliminary step of tester autocalibration is 

performed. It consists to determine the propagation delays 
of the global transmission lines (13) which connect the 

output terminals of the tester (11) to the adequate I/O 
contact pads of the DUT (Device Under Test), typically a 

memory chip (12), each of said global transmission line 
being comprised of an ideal transmission line element: the 

coaxial cable (13-1) and an imperfect transmission line 
element: the probing head (13-2) which includes the contact 

probe (16-1). The novel method of auto-calibration 
includes the steps of: 


the DUT being removed (to have contact probes disconnected 
from the DUT contact pads), measure the reflection 

delay To for each open terminated global transmission line 
as standard; 
all the contact probes now being grounded, measure the 
reflection delay Ts for each short terminated global 

transmission line; 
determine a reflection coefficient G for each global 
transmission line that is given by 


G = (R-Rc)/(R+Rc) 
 
wherein R is either the DUT input impedance (case the 

global transmission line is connected to a DUT receiver) 
or DUT output impedance (case the global transmission line 

is connected to a DUT driver) and Rc is the characteristic 
impedance of the coaxial cable of the global transmission 

line;  
compute the value of the real propagation delay Ti of 
each global transmission line using the following formula: 


Ti = To (1+G)/4 + Ts (1-G)/4 
 
; 
load the obtained values in the memory of the tester for 
automatic calibration of each of the global transmission 

lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the testing of electronic 
components such as high performance bipolar and CMOS VLSI 
semiconductor chips embedding logic and memory arrays and 
more particularly to a method for accurately calibrating 
the global transmission lines between the tester output 
terminals and the I/O (Input/Output) contact pads of a 
product SRAM silicon chip to allow accurate memory address 
access time measurements thereof at the wafer level. The 
address access time (AAT) is a measurement of importance 
in the quality of SRAM memories because this parameter 
measures the speed at which the memory responds. Prior to perform said access time measurements, state of 
the art testers need a preliminary step of auto-calibration 
to get rid of the propagation delays caused by the 
global transmission lines. By global transmission line it 
is meant the line which connects a tester output terminal 
and a chip I/O contact pad. A global transmission line 
essentially consists of two elements: first, a substantially 
ideal transmission line formed by a piece of a 
coaxial cable and second, a far from ideal transmission 
line due to the structure of the probing head. Unlike, the 
first element which has a relatively constant characteristic 
impedance, the second element formed by a space transformer 
and a contact probe terminated by a tip, has a 
variable characteristic impedance. Typically, the characteristic 
impedance of the coaxial cable is resistive (referred 
to hereafter as Rc) and its value is about 50 ohms. 
The characteristic impedance of the probing head is also 
resistive but may vary from 40 to 200 ohms. As known for 
those skilled in the art, all the tips of the probing head 
are arranged in a matrix that perfectly matches the chip 
contact pad array.  A classical tester autocalibration technique uses a single 
reflectometry measurement on each global transmission line 
let open on the side opposite to the tester. To that end, 
a signal is emitted by the tester and propagates along the 
line. The time needed to get the reflected signal back to 
the tester is measured. The propagation (or transmission) 
delay of the global transmission line is supposed to be 
half of the measured time so-called the reflection delay. 
Propagation delays of all global transmission lines are 
stored in a table and values of this table are used to 
correct driver and receiver signal edges. It is to be 
noted that modern semiconductor chips may include up to 
1000 I/O contact pads. Consequently, the table
