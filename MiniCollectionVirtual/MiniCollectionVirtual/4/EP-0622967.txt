<ABSTRACT>
A traffic generator (TFG) for generating a packet 
information stream (OUT) with predetermined characteristics 

based on individual characteristics of a plurality of traffic 
sources (S0-255, G240-241) is proposed. Such a traffic 

generator is an essential test tool for Asynchronous Transfer 
Mode or ATM networks and thus plays an important role in the 

emergence of such networks. 
The traffic generator includes a generation memory 
(GT) storing a series of individual data (Group A-E) related 

to said sources, and a generation means (GM) to cyclically 
read said series of individual source related data. Each of 

said individual source related data (Group A-E) relates to at 
least one of said sources (S0-255, G240-241) as well as to 

generation decision data (GD, GEOT) associated thereto. The 
generation means generates for this one source based on its 

associated generation decision data. 
Thanks to the generation decision data it can be 
avoided that a complicated and time-consuming algorithm for 

calculating a new series of individual source related data 
needs to be run every time the actual bitrate of one of the 

sources is updated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a traffic
generator for generating a packet information stream
comprising information packets of a plurality of traffic
sources, said generator including a generation memory storing
a series of individual data related to said sources, and a
generation means to cyclically read said series of individual
source related data and to generate a packet for each
individual source related data read.The paper by Mignotti et al., "Performance evaluation of
broadband connections and services under varying
traffic loads", Electronics & Communication Journal
4 (1992) August, No.4, London, GB, discloses the use
of a traffic generator for the evaluation of ATM
network performance.The paper by Audexser et al., "ATM -Meßtechnik für das
Breit band-ISDN", NTZ Nachrichten Technische Zeitschrift,
46(1993) Februar, No. 2, Berlin, DE, discloses ATM
test equipment for protocol testing, conformance testing
and the measurement of bit errors, cell loss and all
delay variation.A traffic generator is an essential test tool
for devices which are to be used in Asynchronous Transfer
Mode or ATM networks and thus plays an important role in the
emergence of such networks. To realize this goal, the packet
information stream generated needs to have predetermined
characteristics based on individual characteristics of the
traffic sources, such as their mean and peak bitrates.This necessitates the calculation of the actual
characteristics of the traffic sources, i.e. their actual
bitrates, from their mentioned individual characteristics as
well as the selection of the source for which a packet has
actually to be generated. This computation is slow compared
to the transmission rates in ATM networks, even if state of
the art technology is used, and has therefore to be done off-line.In a possible traffic generator each individual
source related data relates either to exactly one source or
to none of the sources, and the mentioned generation means
generates, upon reading the latter data, a packet for this
source or an idle packet respectively. This memory is
initialized on beforehand according to the individual
characteristics of the traffic sources.In order to realize a long non-repetitive
information stream without having to provide an unfeasibly
large amount of memory, modifying means have to be provided
for performing a periodic off-line computation to update the  
actual bitrates of the traffic sources according to their
characteristics and to modify the individual source related
data accordingly.A drawback
