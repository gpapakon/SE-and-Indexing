<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a toilet flushing system comprising a water reservoir (6) provided with a water inlet (7), and a water outlet (12, 13) for directing water into or towards an associated toilet bowl (3); a discharge chamber (4) communicating with the discharge outlet (29) of the toilet bowl (3), the discharge chamber (4) having at a downstream location thereof an exit opening provided with closure means (30); and air conduit (5) extending between an upper end of the water reservoir (6) and the discharge chamber (4) such that reductions in air pressure within the upper end of the water reservoir (6) caused by a fall in water level in the water reservoir (6) are transmitted to the discharge chamber (4) to produce temporarily a partial vacuum therein thereby to draw water from the toilet bowl (3) through the discharge chamber (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vacuum assisted toilet 
flushing system and is concerned with a toilet flushing system according to the preambles of claims 1 and 2 which 
comprises a water reservoir provided with a water inlet, 
and a water outlet for directing water into or towards an 
associated toilet bowl; a discharge chamber connected to 
the discharge outlet of the toilet bowl, the discharge 
chamber having at a downstream location thereof an exit 
opening provided with closure means; an air conduit 
extending between an upper end of the water reservoir and 
the discharge chamber such that a reduction in air 
pressure within the upper end of the water reservoir caused by a fall in water level in the water reservoir is 
transmitted to the discharge chamber to produce 
temporarily a partial vacuum therein thereby to draw 
water from the toilet bowl into the discharge chamber. Toilet flushing systems are well known and generally 
have either a wash down or vacuum assisted mode of 
operation. A typical toilet flushing system comprises a 
water reservoir, a toilet pan or bowl, and a discharge 
outlet connected to a waste pipe. A problem with the 
toilet flushing systems currently available is that 
relatively large volumes of water are required to flush 
the toilet bowl. In recognition of this problem, it has 
been proposed that all new toilet flushing systems should 
be adapted such that the maximum volume of water utilised 
in a single flushing operation is 7 litres. However, 
this is still a large volume of water, and there remains 
a need for a toilet flushing system which utilises 
smaller volumes of water. An example of a toilet flushing 
system of the type referred to above and according to the preambles of claims 1 and 2 is described in US-A-380,854 
in the name of James E Boyle. This makes use 
of an inverted bell in the water reservoir, the bell 
being connected to the discharge outlet of the toilet. 
Raising the bell causes a partial vacuum to be generated  
 
therein which is transmitted to the discharge chamber to 
assist flushing. However, there is no suggestion that 
flushing can be achieved using greatly reduced volumes of 
flushing water. It is an object of the present invention to overcome 
the aforesaid problems and to provide a toilet flushing 
system which in general requires much smaller volumes of 
flushing water. According to one aspect of the present invention in 
addition to the air conduit the water reservoir is 
provided with a second air inlet for initially admitting 
air when

<CLAIMS>
A toilet flushing system comprising a water 
reservoir (6;36) provided with a water inlet (7;39), and 

a water outlet (13;27;73) for directing water into or 
towards an associated toilet bowl (3); 


a discharge chamber (4;81) connected to the discharge 
outlet of the toilet bowl, the discharge chamber (4;81) 

having at a downstream location thereof an exit opening 
provided with closure means (30;80;82); 
an air conduit (5) extending between an upper end of the 
water reservoir (6;36) and the discharge chamber (4;81) 

such that a reduction in air pressure within the upper 
end of the water reservoir (6;36) caused by a fall in water level in the water reservoir (6;36) is transmitted to the 

discharge chamber (4;81) to produce temporarily a partial 
vacuum therein thereby to draw water from the toilet bowl 

(3) into the discharge chamber; characterised in that in 
addition to the air conduit (5) the water reservoir is 

provided with a second air inlet (17;64) for initially 
admitting air when the water level in the reservoir 

(6;36) falls and means (21;71) for closing the second air 
inlet (17;64) in response to a fall in wat
er level in the 
reservoir (6;36). 
A toilet flushing system comprising a water 
reservoir (6;36) provided with a water inlet (7;39), and 

a water outlet (13;27;73) for directed water into or 
towards an associated toilet bowl (3); 


a discharge chamber (4;81) connected to the discharge 
outlet of the toilet bowl, the discharge chamber (4;81) 

having at a downstream location thereof an exit opening 
provided with closure means (30;80;82) ; 
an air conduit (5) extending between an upper end of the 
water reservoir (6;36) and the discharge chamber (4;81) 

such that a reduction in air pressure within the upper  
 

end of the water reservoir (6;36) caused by a fall in 
water level in the water reservoir (6;36) is transmitted 

to the discharge chamber (4;81) to produce temporarily a 
partial vacuum therein thereby to draw water from the 

toilet bowl (3) into the discharge chamber; characterised 
in that an air pipe (45;72) is provided which extends 

between a down pipe (43;73), extending from the water 
reservoir (6;36) to the water outlet (13;27;73), and the 

interior of the water reservoir (6;36) such that initial 
outflow of water from the reservoir (6;36) through the 

downpipe (43;73) displaces a limited volume of air from 
the downpipe (43;73) to the interior of the water 

reservoir (6;36). 
A toilet flushing system according to claim 1 
wherein the means (21;71) for closing the second air 

inlet (17;64) is a flap, plunger or valve operatively 
linked to a float (20). 
A toilet flushing system according to claim 2 which 
is provided with a siphonic mechanism (42) disposed 

within the water reservoir (6;36), actuation of the 
siphonic mechanism (42) serving to initiate the fall in 

water level in the reservoir (6;36) thereby generating 
the partial vacuum.

preceding claims wherein the closure means (30) at the 

exit opening of the discharge chamber (4) is 
unidirectional. 
A toilet flushing system according to claim 5 
wherein the closure means takes the form of a one-way 

flap valve (30).

of the reservoir (6;36) after a fall in the level of 

water therein. 
A toilet flushing system according to claim 9 
wherein the water inlet (7;39) is linked to a second 

reservoir (8;35) provided with a float valve 
(9;10;37;38). 
A toilet flushing system according to any one of the
