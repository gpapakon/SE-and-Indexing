<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a semiconductor memory device
having a memory cell array, a write/read circuit which

writes during the test mode a plurality of identical data
to the memory cell array in response to input addresses

and reads the plurality of data from the memory cell array
in response to the same addresses, a comparison data

register which stores data identical to the plurality of
data written to the memory cell array during the test mode,

a decision circuit which compares the plurality of data
read from the memory cell array and the data stored in

the comparison data register to decide the coincidence or
noncoincidence of the levels of all the data, and outputs

a decision signal of a coincidence level of a noncoincidence
level, and a decision result register which is reset

immediately after the start of the test mode and is set
to a set level in response to a decision signal of

noncoincidence level and holds the state until it is
reset again.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device and, more particularly, to a semiconductor memory
device capable of executing data write and read test
operation on a plurality of bits in parallel to one another.In recent years, the increase in testing time of a
memory device is concerned in accordance with increase in
number of bits or memory cells (called hereinafter "bit
number") thereof. This is because each memory cell is
required to be written with test data and the test data
is then read out therefrom so that the testing time is
increased in proportion to the increase of the bit number
of the memories. In particular, the memory capacity has
been quadrupled in every 3 or 4 years, so that the increase
in the testing time has become a problem that cannot be
affored to be ignored.In order to deal with such a problem, a semiconductor
memory device equipped with a test circuit which is
activated during a test mode to write and read test data
in and from a plurality of memory cells was proposed as 
disclosed in ISSCC 85 Digest of Technical Papers, pp.
240-241, titled "A 90ns 1Mb DRAM with Multi-Bit Test Mode".
Namely, during the test mode, the test data having logic
"1" or "0" is written simultaneously into four memory cells,
and the test data thus written are then read out therefrom
simultaneously, to detect whether or not the four test
data are coincident with one other. If any one of them
14 incoincident with the remaining data, a noncoincidence
detection signal is output as a defective bit detection
signal to inform the defectiveness of the memory cell or
cells. By the provision of such a circuit, a reduction
in the testing time is effected.However, in this test circuit, the noncoincidence
detection signal is in valid only during one test access
operation for four memory cells. For this reason, the
defective bit detection signal has to be monitored every
one test access operation, i.e., every four memory cells.
As a result, while the test time for one memory device is
shortened, the total test time for one test board including
a plurality of memory devices are not reduced as expected.
This will be further described in the following by
referring to FIG. 1.Specifically, it is general to carry out tests for
a large number of memory devices in parallel by loading
memory devices on a monitor burn-in-test board 101 in a
matrix form of m x k, as shown in FIG. 1. However, in order 
to carry out the test for all memories simultaneously in
a batch, there are needed signal lines for m x k defective
bit
