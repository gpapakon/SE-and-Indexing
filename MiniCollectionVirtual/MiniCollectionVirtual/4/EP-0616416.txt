<ABSTRACT>
A conversion apparatus including a plurality of 
high-speed switching devices (51-56), each being operable in latch 

type operation and non-latch type operation and a power 
source (1) for supplying a first current to the high-speed 

switching devices (51-56), thereby forming a current path of the 
high-speed switching devices (51-56). The high-speed switching 

device is turned off after changeover from the latch type 
operation to the non-latch type operation. The conversion 

apparatus further includes a current regulation circuit (30) 
provided in the current path for regulating a second 

current flowing through the current regulation circuit (30) from 
a time when the second current reaches a prescribed value. 

In a case of overcurrent malfunction, the high-speed 
switching device is changed from the latch type operation 

to the non-latch type operation, and then is caused to be 
turned off during when the current regulation circuit 

regulates the second current.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conversion
apparatus which uses high-speed switching devices
(abbreviated below to HSDs) possessing two functions, latch
type and non-latch type functions.Power devices conventionally used in conversion
apparatus for converting DC power to AC power to DC power,
AC power to AC power with a different frequency or DC
power to DC power with a different voltage include gate
turn off (GTO) thyristors (called GTOs below) and transistors. A
GTO is a latch type device, which means that once the
GTO is brought to an ON state by applying a signal to its
gate, anode current continues to flow even if the gate
signal is made "0".A transistor, on the other hand, conducts when a base
signal is supplied but the collector current becomes "0"
when the base signal is removed. A device such as this
will be called a non-latch type device here.GTOs are widely used as high-voltage, high-current
semiconductor devices whose turn-on voltage is
comparatively low. But since current filamentation occurs
when they are switched OFF, their breakdown withstand
capability is low and large snubber circuits are necessary. 
Also, their switching speed is not fast.In contrast, an insulated gate bipolar transistor
(called IGBT below) is not liable to break down, since there
is no current filamentation, and its switching speed is
fast, but it is not suitable for high-voltage applications.
Progress has been made in the development of devices with
fast switching speeds at high voltage, and one candidate is
a device for which the concept is that when the device is in
an ON state its structure is made a latch type so as to
reduce conduction losses and immediately before turn-off the
device structure is changed over to a non-latch type so as
to avoid current filamentation. A specific example is the
device shown in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No.
64-758.An example of a conventional conversion apparatus using
the latch type devices GTOs is disclosed in EP-B-0 105 510.
A typical apparatus in shown in Fig. 8. In the figure, 1 is
a DC power source, 2P and 2N are DC circuit breakers, 3 is a
DC reactor, 4 is a DC capacitor, 5 is a reactor, 6 is a
diode, 7 and 8 are DC buses, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are
GTos, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 are feedback diodes and 25U,
25V and 25W are AC circuit breakers. This circuit is widely
used and is well-known as ah inverter and, although not
shown, snubber circuits and gate circuits, etc. are needed,
but a description of the operation of this circuit will be
omitted here.If,
