<ABSTRACT>
In a radio paging receiver for receiving a pager 
signal comprising a succession of frames each of which 

consists of first through n-th group signals, a first 
clock generating unit (21) generates a first clock signal 

having a first clock rate. A synchronization clock 
generating unit (23) generates a synchronization clock signal 

which is synchronized with digital word data derived from 
a receiving section and which has a synchronization clock 

rate equal to the first clock rate. A selecting circuit (27) 
selects either the first clock signal or the 

synchronization clock signal as a selected clock signal. 
A counter (29) carries out a counting operation by the use of 

the selected clock signal and produces a counted signal. 
Responsive to the counted signal, a control circuit (30) 

produces a control signal to make a battery saving switch 
has an on state and to make the synchronization clock 

generating unit has an active state. The selecting 
circuit selects the synchronization clock signal while 

the control circuit produces the control signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radio paging receiver
for receiving a pager signal comprising a call number
signal and a message signal.A recent remarkable development of an integrated
circuit technique has rendered the radio paging receiver
compact or portable and multifunctional. Preferably, the
radio paging receiver has a long life. Inasmuch as a
battery is used as a power source in the radio paying
receiver, the radio paging receiver has a life time
dependent upon the life of battery. Therefore, electric
power must not be wasted in the radio paging receiver.
In other words, useless operation should strictly be
restricted. For this purpose, a battery saving operation
is carried out in such a radio paging receiver.As an example of the radio paging receiver, a
synchronous type is well known in the art. In the
synchronous type, the radio paging receiver receives a
pager signal comprising a succession of frames each of
which has a frame period Ft and which consists of first
through n-th group signals where n represents a positive
integer greater than unity. Each of the first through 
the n-th group signals has a signal duration Dt and
comprises a call number signal representative of a call
number and a message signal representative of a message.As known in the art, the radio paging receiver
has a preassigned call number which belongs to one of the
first through the n-th group signal. The radio paging
receiver comprises a receiving section for receiving the
pager signal, a battery saving switch connected between a
battery and the receiving section, and a control unit for
controlling said battery saving switch. The battery
saving switch has on and off states and supplies electric
power to said receiving section in the on state. The
control unit puts the battery saving switch into the on
state so that the receiving section receives only the one
of the first through the n-th group signals to which the
preassigned call number belongs. In other words, the
receiving section periodically carries out a receiving
operation at the frame period Ft and receives the one of
the first through the n-th group signals as a reception
group signal. This means that the battery saving
operation is carried out in the radio paging receiver.
Thus, the control unit serves as a switch driving unit
for carrying out the battery saving operation.The receiving section supplies the reception
group signal to the control unit. The control unit
carries out a decision operation whether or not the
reception group signal contains the call number
