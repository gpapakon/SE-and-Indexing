<ABSTRACT>
A phase locked loop (PLL) (40) simultaneously has both 
relatively-low power consumption and relatively-low jitter on a 

clock output signal. The PLL (40) includes a phase detector (41) 
and a phase error accumulator (42) connected to the output of the 

phase detector (41). The phase error accumulator (42) samples an 
output of the phase detector (41) at a relatively-high clock rate, 

but accumulates these samples and provides an output thereof to 
a loop filter (43) at a relatively-low clock rate. Thus the PLL 

(40) captures short periods of phase delay to maintain low clock 
output signal jitter, while at the same time, however, the loop 

filter (43) need only adjust its output periodically, at the 
relatively-low rate, thereby saving power. The phase detector 

(41) detects a metastable condition on a phase detector latch (60) 
and resolves to an up pulse or a down pulse to further reduce 

clock output signal jitter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrical circuits, and 
more particularly, to phase locked loops. A basic phase locked loop (PLL) has a phase detector which 
provides a phase detect output signal indicative of the phase 
difference between a loop clock signal and a reference clock 
signal. The phase detector provides the phase detect output 
signal to an input of a loop filter. The loop filter is a lowpass 
filter which provides an output voltage level indicative of the 
length of time the phase detector detects the two clock signals 
are out of phase. The output of the loop filter drives an input of a 
voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). The VCO then provides a 
clock output signal having a desired frequency. The clock output 
signal is divided in a loop divider to provide the loop clock signal. 
Thus, the PLL is able to generate the clock output signal having a 
frequency that is many times greater than that of the reference 
clock signal, based on the value of the loop divider. In a digital implementation, a phase detector provides a 
digital output to indicate a phase difference between the two 
input clock signals. For example, a three-state phase detector 
may provide a single output signal in a logic high state to indicate 
a leading phase between the reference clock signal and the loop 
clock signal, in a logic low state to indicate a lagging phase, and 
in a high impedance state to indicate a lock condition. Another 
type of digital phase detector, known as a type IV phase detector, 
provides one output signal in an active logic state, such as a logic 
high, to indicate the leading phase between the reference clock 
signal and the loop clock signal. The type IV phase detector also 
provides a second output signal in the active logic state to 
represent the lagging phase between the reference clock signal 
and the loop clock signal. The type IV phase detector provides  
 
both output signals in an inactive logic state to indicate the lock 
condition. The digital loop filter then samples the output of the phase 
detector at a relatively high rate to accurately detect the amount 
of time the signals are out of lock. The loop filter provides a 
digital code based on the current and prior value of the samples. 
This type of PLL presents an inherent tradeoff between power 
consumption and sensitivity to clock jitter. If the loop filter 
samples the output of the phase detector at a relatively high rate, 
it more accurately represents the phase difference, and thus the 
PLL provides the clock
