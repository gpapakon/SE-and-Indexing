<ABSTRACT>
Long wavelength, narrow emission bandwidth fluorescein dyes are provided for detecting spacially overlapping target substances. The dyes comprise 4,7-dichlorofluoresceins, and particularly 2',4',5',7'-tetrachloro-4,7-dichloro-5- (and 6-) carboxyfluoresceins. Methods and kits for using the dyes in DNA analysis are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to fluorescent labelling techniques, and more particularly,
to the use of 4,7-dichlorofluoreceins for detecting multiple target substances in the same
sample.Many diagnostic and analytical techniques require that multiple target substances in the
same sample be labelled with distinguishable fluorescent tages, e.g. Lanier et al, J. Immunol.,
Vol. 132, pgs. 151.156 (1984)(flow cytometry); Gray et al, Chromosoma, Vol. 73, pgs. 9-27
(1979)(flow system karyotyping); Fung et al, U.S. patent 4,855,225 (DNA sequencing); and
Mayrand et al, Applied and Theoretical Electrophoresis, Vol. 3, pgs. 1-11 (1992)(analysis of
electrophoretically separated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products). This requirement is
particularly difficult to satisfy in DNA sequence analysis where at least four spectrally resolvable
dyes are needed in most automated sequencing approaches.Presently, there are two basic approaches to DNA sequence determination: the dideoxy
chain termination method, e.g. Sanger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., Vol. 74, pgs. 5463-5467
(1977); and the chemical degradation method, e.g. Maxam et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., Vol. 74,
pgs.560-564 (1977). The chain termination method has been improved in several ways, and
serves as the basis for all currently available automated DNA sequencing machines, e.g. Sanger
et al, J. Mol. Biol., Vol. 143, pgs. 161-178 (1980); Schreier et al, J. Mol. Biol., Vol. 129, pgs. 169-172
(1979); Smith et al, Nucleic Acids Research. Vol. 13, pgs. 2399-2412 (1985); 35Smith et al,
Nature, Vol. 321, pgs. 674-679 (1987); Prober et al, Science, Vol. 238, pgs. 336-341
(1987),Section II, Meth. Enzymol., Vol. 155, pgs. 51-334 (1987); Church et al, Science, Vol 240,
pgs. 185-188 (1988); and Connell et al, Biotechniques, Vol. 5, pgs. 342-348 (1987).Both the chain termination and chemical degradation methods require the generation of
one or more sets of labeled DNA fragments, each having a common origin and each terminating
with a known base. The set or sets of fragments must then be separated by size to obtain 
sequence information. In both methods, the DNA fragments are separated by high resolution gel
electrophoresis. In most automated DNA sequencing machines, fragments having different
terminating bases are labeled with different fluorescent dyes, which are attached either to a
primer, e.g. Smith et al (1987, cited above), or to the base of a terminal dideoxynucleotide, e.g.
Prober et al (cited above). The labeled fragments are combined and loaded onto the same
