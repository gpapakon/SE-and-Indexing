<DESCRIPTION>
 THERAPEUTIC INHIBITION OF PLATELET AGGREGATION BY NUCLEOPHILE-NITRIC OXIDE COMPLEXES AND DERIVATIVES THEREOFFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is concerned with providing a novel method of inhibiting platelet aggregation in an in vivo setting by utilizing nucleophile-nitric oxide complexes which possess at least one -N202" moiety and release nitric oxide in vivo in a stable and controlled fashion.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONU.S. Patent 4,954,526, issued on September 4, 1990, discloses stabilized nitric oxide - primary a ine complexes which release nitric oxide in vivo and discloses that they are useful in treating cardioÂ¬ vascular disorders. U.S. Patent 5,039,705, issued August 13, 1991, discloses anti-hypertensive compositions of secondary amine-nitric oxide adducts which release nitric oxide in vivo and that they are useful in lowering blood pressure in mammals. U.S. Patent application Serial Number 07/585,793, filed on September 20, 1990, discloses complexes of nitric oxide with polyamines which release nitric oxide in vivo in a sustained and controllable fashion, and discloses that the compounds are useful in treating cardiovascular disorders. U.S. Patent application Serial Number 07/743,892, filed on August 12, 1991, discloses anti- hypertensive compositions of additional secondary amine- 

 nitric oxide adducts which release nitric oxide in vivo and which are disclosed to be useful in controlling blood pressure in vivo. U.S. Patent application Serial Number 07/423,279, filed on October 18, 1989, discloses anti-hypertensive compositions and methods of lowering blood pressure in mammals, which each utilize certain active compounds containing an N-oxo-N-nitrosoamine sub- stituent, the compounds are disclosed to decompose under physiological conditions to release nitric oxide in vivo. U.S. Patent application Serial Number07/764,908, filed on September 24, 1991 by Keefer et al discloses oxygen substituted derivatives of nucleophile- nitric oxide adducts which are prodrugs for nitric oxide release in vivo and which are useful in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.Each of the above disclosed U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. None of the above U.S. patents and/or U.S. patent applications discloses that the nitric oxide complexes disclosed therein inhibit platelet aggregation.Among the most widely used clinical antiplatelet agents is aspirin, which acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzymes responsible for the arachidonic acid

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
Claim 1. A method of inhibiting platelet aggregation in vivo, in a patient in need thereof, the method comprising: administering to the patient an effective platelet aggregation inhibiting amount of a physiologically compatible compound containing at least one N-oxo- N-nitrosoamine moiety in a molecule thereof, wherein the physiologically compatible compound releases nitric oxide in vivo in a controllable and sustained fashion.
Claim 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the physiologically compatible compound is (C

)
2
-N-N(ONa)- N=0.
Claim 3. The method of claim l, wherein the physiologically compatible compound is spermine bis (nitric oxide)adduct.
Claim 4. The method of claim l, wherein said physiologically compatible compound is administered to the patient by intravenous injection.
Claim 5. The method of claim , wherein said physiologically compatible compound is administered in an amount of 0.01 to 10.0 mg/kg/day.
