<ABSTRACT>
An article of sport footwear with a shell (2) 
formed with two, respectively forward and rearward, 

longitudinally opposite openings (9,10) which extend from a 
shell entrance (8) and identify two lateral sides (11a,b), 

with a bootleg (4) pivoted on the shell and at least one 
fastening device (21a,24a;21b,24b) bridging the 

corresponding opening and being adjustable in length, whose 
opposite ends are anchored on respective lateral sides of 

the shell proximate to the entrance to limit the rearward 
swing range of the bootleg and/or the forward flex of the 

boot.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an article of sport 
footwear, in particular to a ski boot, a skating boot, or 
the like, having a shell with a main longitudinal spread and 
formed with two longitudinally opposite, respectively 
forward and rearward, openings being so located on said 
shell as to respectively allow the skier's leg to lean 
forwards and rearwards, said openings extending from a shell 
entrance and defining two transversely opposite lateral 
sides on said shell, a bootleg pivoted on the shell and 
embracing said lateral sides at least partway, and a means 
on the shell of limiting the allowable bootleg rearward 
swing and/or limiting the allowable boot forward flex. The bootlegs of ski boots of the above kind are 
usually arranged to return, from a normal skiing position 
where the skier's leg is imposed a slight forward bend, to a 
rest position which allows for increased stretching, and 
hence enhanced relaxation, of the leg muscles. The ability 
to switch to this position is specially appreciated while 
walking or during rest breaks. Also known is that such boots 
are provided with a means of adjusting the allowable forward 
flex of the leg, i.e. toward the toe of the boot, from the 
above-mentioned skiing position. A boot type which incorporates both features is 
known, for example, from European Patent Application NÂ° 
93201691.8 by this Applicant. That document discloses a boot having a bootleg 
which is pivoted by means or pins to the shell and secured 
to the shell through a knob affording three position 
settings, namely: a setting where the bootleg is locked 
relative to the shell for the skiing position, a setting 
where a rearward swing is allowed from the skiing position 
toward a rest position, and a setting where a forward swing  
 
is allowed from the skiing position toward a more 
forward-leaning position. While that boot is technically satisfactory, and 
its adjustable feature beneficial, it still has a drawback 
in that it affords no freedom of adjustment for the stop 
positions to the forward or rearward swings of the bootleg, 
except as allowed for by the knob control. In addition, due 
to the relative proximity of the elements attaching the 
shell to the bootleg and providing such limitations and the 
pins whereby the bootleg is pivotably connected to the 
shell, a comparatively large stress is imposed on such 
attachment elements and the shell, for a given resisting 
torque provided to limit said swing movements. Also, the imposable limitations, but for the 
locked

An article of sport footwear, in particular a 
ski boot, having a shell (2) with a main longitudinal spread 

and formed with two longitudinally opposite, respectively 
forward and rearward, openings (9,10) being so located on 

said shell as to respectively allow the skier's leg to lean 
forwards and rearwards, said openings extending from a shell 

entrance (8) and defining two transversely opposite lateral 
sides (11a,b) on said shell, a bootleg (4) pivoted on the 

shell and embracing said lateral sides at least partway, and 
a means on the shell of limiting the allowable bootleg 

rearward swing and/or limiting the allowable boot forward 
flex, characterized in that said means comprises at least 

one fastening device (21a,24a;21b,24b;30a-34a,30b-34b) which 
extends between said lateral sides of the shell to bridge 

the corresponding opening, said fastening device comprising 
respective fastening elements attached to the corresponding 

lateral sides (11a,b) at a location close to said entrance 
and coupled adjustably together. 
An article of footwear according to Claim 1, 
wherein said fastening device (21a,24a;30b-34b) extends 

through the rearward opening (10) and is so attached to the 
bootleg (4) as to limit the rearward swing of said bootleg 

relative to the shell. 
An article of footwear according to either 
Claim 1 or 2, wherein said fastening device 

(21b,24b;30a-34a) extends through the forward opening (9) 
and acts on a forward support (3a) of the boot to limit the 

forward flex of said support and/or said bootleg relative to 
the shell. 
An article of footwear according to Claims 2 
and 3, wherein corresponding fastening elements 

(21a,24a;30b,34b;21b,24b;30a,34a) of said fastening devices 
respectively provided on the forward and the rearward 

 
openings (9,10) of the shell are secured at common locations 

(20,23;31) on a respective one of the lateral sides (11a,b). 
An article of footwear according to one or more 
of the preceding claims, wherein fastening arrangements 

(14,16,17) are provided on at least one of said shell and 
bootleg for closing the boot, said fastening arrangements 

being independent of said at least one fastening device 
(21a,24a;30b,34b; 21b,24b;30a,34a). 
An article of footwear according to one or more 
of the preceding claims, wherein the lateral sides (11a,b) 

of the shell are extended to below the bootleg (4) such that 
they will project beyond it on the side of said entrance 

(8). 
An article of footwear according to Claim 6, 
wherein said elements of the fastening devices are anchored 

on their respective lateral sides (11a,b) at the locations 
of said portions thereof projecting beyond the bootleg (4). 
An article of footwear according to one or more 
of the preceding claims, wherein said fastening devices 

(21a,24a;30b,34b;21b,24b;30a,34a) are a pull-apart type. 
An article of footwear according to one or more 
of the preceding claims, wherein the bootleg (4) has a lug 

(18) providing hind support for the skier's leg, the 
corresponding fastening device (21a,24a) extending around 

the bootleg at said lug (18). 
An article of footwear according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, wherein said fastening devices 

comprise a first band-like flexible element (21a,b) attached 
at the middle to one corresponding lateral side (11a) and 

carrying on its opposite ends complemental fastening means 
(22), whereby both ends of said band-like element can be 

closed on each other, and a second band-like element (24a,b) 
attached at the middle to the other corresponding lateral 

side (11b) and carrying on its opposite ends a respective 
 

ring (25) wherethrough the corresponding end of the first 
band-like element is passed.
