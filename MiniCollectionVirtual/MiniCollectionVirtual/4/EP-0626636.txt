<ABSTRACT>
An information processing system which comprises an 
integral input and display unit comprising a display (101) 

which enables an object to be selectively displayed at one 
of a plurality of positions in a display area and a tablet 

(112) having an input face overlaid on a display face of the 
display, the input and display face being disposed substantially 

horizontally, and a display (121) whose display face 
is disposed substantially uprightly, wherein when an object 

is presented to a user in the display area of the display, a 
display position of the object is determined in response to 

at least one of a state of the user, a state of the input 
and display face, and a display state of the display, 

thereby enabling the object to be displayed at an easy-to-use 
position relative to the user's position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an information processing system
having an integral input and display unit with a display and a tablet,
wherein an input face is overlaid on a display face.A system described in the paper "The Digital Desk
Calculator: Tangible Manipulation on a Desk Top Display,"
Proceedings of UIST'91, ACM, 1991 by Pierre Wellner is taken as a
conventional example of an information processing system using
the full surface of a desk as a display area and an input area. The
system comprises a computer-controlled camera and projector
above a desk. The projector is used for display and the camera for
input. The system provides a "digital desk" having the functions
of reading a paper document on the desk by the camera, for
conversion to an electronic document and displaying it on the desk
by the projector or printing the electronic document by a printer
for conversion to a paper document, for example. Also disclosed
is a user interface on which a position or articles on the desk is
pointed to by a user's finger on the desk. Further, the paper
suggests that actual stationeries such as an eraser can be used
for performing processing related thereto.However, in the related art such as the digital desk, the 
user interface does not care to make full use of an integral input
and display unit (or a digitizing tablet overlaying a display
screen) of a large screen or a plurality of displays.That is, the related art teaches the idea that motion of a
user's hand or an actual stationery is detected for use as a user
interface, but fails to disclose an idea that the display position
of the object to be displayed, which will be hereinafter referred
to as the object, is determined by the user position or that the
display position is determined avoiding places hidden by
obstacles on the desk. This means that little or no consideration
is given to possible problems which will occur when the integral
input and display unit is enlarged to the size of the entire desk.For example, the problems of the integral input and display
unit of a large screen are as follows: If a display 40 inches wide,
namely, about 1 m diagonal, is positioned with its screen face
placed horizontally just in front of a user, unlike a conventional
CRT display viewed by the user at a distance therefrom, it is
difficult for the user to see the displayed object depending on the
positional relationship between the object display position and
the position where the user sits, or there is a chance that it will
be difficult for the user to perform
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An information processing system which displays an object on a display,
comprising:

   a large-screen integral input and display unit comprising a display (101, 121) which
enables an object to be selectively displayed at one of a plurality of positions in a

display area and a tablet (112) having an input face overlaid on a display face of
said display (101), the input and display face being disposed substantially

horizontally,

   
characterized by

   a display position determination means (159) having a user position
detection means (159, 1000) 
for detecting a position of the user's head, face or body relative to said
integral input and display unit for determining a position near the detected user

position as a display position presenting the object, wherein said display position
determination means (159), when an object is to be presented to a user in the

display area of said display (101,121), determines a display position of the object
in response to the position of the user, a position of any

article placed on the input and display face, and a display state of said display
(101, 121).
The information processing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
user position detection means is made up of means (108) for inputting an image

of the user and means (152) for processing an image inputted by said input
means (108).
The information processing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
display position determination means has means (107) for detecting an article

placed on the input and display face for determining the display position of the
object so as to avoid a position of the articles detected by said article detection

means.
The information processing system as claimed in claim 3, wherein said
article detection means has 


means for inputting the input and display face;
means (151) for processing an image inputted by said input means; and
display control means for temporarily stopping display of the object at a
time when an image is inputted by said input means.
The information processing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
display position determination means (159) has means for storing display

position information of an object displayed on the input and display face for
determining the display position of that object so as to avoid the display position

of the object stored in said position information storage means.
The information processing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
display position determination means (159) provides a plurality of decision

conditions concerning the state of the user, the state of any article placed on the
input and display face, and the display state of said display, assigns priority levels

to said plurality of decision conditions and combinations thereof, and finds a
position at which the object is to be displayed in sequence according to the

priority levels.
The information processing system as claimed in claim 1, further
comprising:


an additional display device whose display screen is upright with respect to
said integral input and display unit; and
pen detection means for determining whether or not the user picks up a
pen (104) of said tablet (112),
wherein said display position determination means (159) displays the object
on said integral input and display unit if it is recognized that the user picks up the

pen (104) based on a determination result of said pen detection means.
The information processing system as claimed in claim 1, further
comprising:


an additional display device whose display screen is upright with respect to
said integral input and display unit; and
keyboard position detection means for detecting a relative position between
the user and a keyboard (105), 
wherein said display position determination means displays the object on
said additional display device, if it is recognized that the keyboard (105) is placed

in front of the user based on a detection result of said keyboard detection means.
