<ABSTRACT>
A small-size loudspeaker (1) which is essentially cuboid and has a sound-radiating front, exhibits indentations (9.1, 9.2) at its front and its rear (2) parallel to the front. These are intended for engaging corresponding projecting parts formed on a clamping holder. As indentations, grooves (9.1, 9.2) which, in particular, are in each case perpendicular to one another, are provided at front and rear (2) so that the small-size loudspeaker (1) can be clamped in the clamping holder in two mutually perpendicular positions. Furthermore, an, in particular, angular recess (6) for the at least partially recessed attachment of a swivel holder in optionally two mutually perpendicular swivel directions is preferably provided at its rear (2).
