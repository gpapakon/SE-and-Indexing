<ABSTRACT>
A weldable plastic pipe (2), especially for gas and fluid conduits, has on the surface at least one electrophysically locatable longitudinal strip (3), preferably of metal. To avoid the longitudinal strip becoming separately detached before welding, the longitudinal strip (3) is kept at a distance from the pipe surface by an underlay (4).

<CLAIMS>
A weldable plastic pipe (2), more particularly for
pipes conveying gases and liquids, provided on its

surface with at least one electrophysically locatable
longitudinal strip (3), preferably of metal, the

longitudinal strip (3) being spaced apart from the pipe
surface by an underlay (4), characterised in that the

thickness of the underlay (4) is at least 0.5 mm,
preferably 2 to 3 mm, so that the total diameter of the

plastic pipe (2, 3, 4) in the region of the
longitudinal strip (3) exceeds the inside diameter of a

heating muffle (1) for subsequent fusion welding.
A plastic pipe according to claim 1, characterised
in that the underlay (4) is made of the same or similar

material to the pipe or of a foamed plastic or non-woven
or a composite fabric made up of non-woven and

foamed plastic.
