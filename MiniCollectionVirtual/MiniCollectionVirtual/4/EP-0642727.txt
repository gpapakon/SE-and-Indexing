<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for controlling a number of electrical loads, for example lights, comprises a main telecommunications network (1). Connected to this are various modules, each comprising one or more switches (11, 12, 13) operating loads (21, 22, 23) in response to control means (10) and commands entered at input stations (2, 3). The communications network is adapted so that commands entered at one module and intended for a switch within that module are not entered on the main communication line. Commands entered at one module and intended for another module, are transmitted along the main communication network using asynchronous transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for 
controlling electrical loads, and relates particularly though 
not exclusively to apparatus for installation in buildings to 
allow lighting, heating and other circuits to be controlled. The conventional system for providing lighting in a room 
of a building is by means of an electrical circuit which 
includes a source of power (mains electricity supply or 
generator), a light, a switch, and electrical power cables 
linking these circuit components. In a private dwelling the 
light switch will typically be located quite near the light. 
In larger buildings the light switch may be some distance 
from the light, an extreme example being buildings such as 
factories where all the widely separated lights can be 
controlled from a single switchboard. Proposals have in the past been made for providing a 
system for controlling the lighting of a building. One 
approach, illustrated for example by US4,240,011, US 
4,388,567 and US 4,716,344 has been to use a centralized 
control system such as a computer. Such arrangements, while 
providing control, do not offer much flexibility and are 
quite complex. US 5,059,871 illustrates an alternative 
approach in which control of the system is distributed to a 
series of input control units communicating via a network. 
In this arrangement, however, all control units are connected 
directly to a single communications network. When a large 
number of units are provided this can cause congestion on the 
network requiring sophisticated, and therefore expensive, 
communications hardware and software. According to the present invention there is provided  
 
apparatus for controlling a number of electrical loads 
comprising an electrical switch for each load, a network 
of telecommunication lines including a connection to each 
electrical switch, command input stations connected to the 
telecommunication network, and control means whereby a 
command entered at one of said input stations travels along the 
network and operates a switch thereby switching on or off 
a load, wherein said network comprises a 
plurality of network modules connected to each other by a 
main telecommunication line, each module comprising 
a said input station and one or more of said switches, characterised in that 
in the case of commands from an input station to 
one of said switches within the same module said control 
means is adapted to send these commands from the input station 
to that switch without entering the command on the main 
communication

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for controlling a number of electrical 
loads (21,22,23,39,40,41,59,60,61,76,77,78,83,84,85) 

comprising an electrical switch 
(11,12,13,36,37,38,56,57,58) for each load, a network of 

telecommunication lines including a connection to each 
electrical switch, command input stations (2, 3, 30,50,70,71,80) connected to the 

telecommunication network, and control means whereby a 
command entered at one of said input stations travels along the 

network and operates a switch thereby switching on or off 
a load, wherein said network comprises a plurality of 

network modules (a,b,c,d,e) connected to each other by a 
main telecommunication line (1), each module comprising 

a said input station and one or more of 
said switches, characterised in that in the case of 

commands from an input station to one of said switches 
within the same module said control means is adapted to 

send these commands from the input station to that switch 
without entering the command on the main communication 

line and wherein in the case of commands from an input 
station to one of said switches within a different module, 

said control means is adapted to enter the command onto 
the main communication line. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein at least some 
of said modules (a,b,c,d,e) comprise one or more sub-modules, each 

said sub-module comprising an input station, one or more 
switches and control means, whereby said network is formed 

with a branched structure. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2 in which 
communications are transmitted asynchronously. 
Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein messages are 
transmitted on said network in either a first protocol or 

a second protocol, said first protocol being shorter than  
 

said second and being used for messages of greater 
urgency. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 in which the 
asynchronous transmission takes place at speeds in the 

range of 50 baud to 56 kilobaud in the form of a logic 
inversion to command attention followed by an eleven byte 

first protocol transmission comprising a starting byte, 
two source identification bytes, two destination 

identification bytes, two command or enquiry bytes, two 
data information bytes, a cyclic redundancy check byte, 

and an end byte. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 in which the 
asynchronous transmission takes place at speeds in the 

range of 50 baud to 56 kilobaud in the form of a logic 
inversion to command attention followed by a thirty-four 

byte second protocol transmission comprising twenty-one 
command information bytes. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim including 
an electrical switch status indicator means for indicating 

the status of the electrical switches connected to the 
network. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim comprising 
means for connection to an external communication line so 

as to enable the apparatus to receive commands from the 
external communication line and enter these commands on to 

the network. 
Apparatus according to claim 8 wherein said external 
communications line comprises a directly wired-in 

telephone line, a remote telephone, or a computer link. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein 
each input station comprises a keypad (90) consisting of  

 
keys for entering commands on the network and a light 

(401) associated with each key of the keypad for 
indicating the status of the electrical switches within 

the same module as said input station. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim in which 
each command input station is independently programmable 

to store complex commands which may be recalled upon 
receipt of a relatively simple command either directly at 

said command input station or by means of a command 
received from the network. 
The apparatus according to any preceding claim 
wherein one of said input stations comprises a telephone 

(91) having a keypad consisting of keys for entering 
commands on the network and a light (401) associated with 

each key of the keypad for indicating the status of 
electrical switches of the apparatus.
