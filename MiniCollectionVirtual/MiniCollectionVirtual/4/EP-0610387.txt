<ABSTRACT>
A luminescence measuring system comprises means (26) for supplying samples located in separate test tubes (25). In the measuring chamber of a luminometer, the samples are in turn presented to a light detector, such as a photomultiplier. Two mutually displaceable components (1, 2), which are cup-shaped and fit into one another with the cup bottoms facing outwards, define the measuring chamber (5). The component shells are provided with holes (11, 12, 11', 12', 14, 15, 16, 17) which can be aligned by displacement of the components so as to admit the test tube into the luminometer and the measuring chamber (5) and to discharge it therefrom under the action of gravity. The test tubes are conveyed to the luminometer by a sleeve-chain conveyor having a bottom with a through hole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a luminescence measuring
system and a luminometer device, i.e. a device
which is designed for making bioluminescence and chemi-luminescence
measurements and in which test tubes with the
substances to be analysed by luminescence are conveyed, in
a series of test-tube holders, past a measuring station
having a light detector, such as a photomultiplier.EP-A-0 226 374 and US-A-4,863,690, for instance, disclose
luminescence measuring systems. The former publication
describes a complex rotary device for removing the
test tubes from the holders one after the other and introducing
them into a measuring chamber, which itself is of
complex design. The latter publication describes a measuring
system having special holders for the test tubes. GB-A-2 223 095 discloses a luminometer arranged to receive
containers, comprising two mutually displaceable components having
holes for admitting under the action of gravity, when said holes are aligned,
the container into a measuring chamber defined by said components.The objects of the invention are to provide a luminescence
measuring system and a luminometer device which is
simple, does not require any special holders for the test
tubes, and is reliably lightproof during the measurements.According to the invention, these objects are achieved
by a luminescence measuring system and a luminometer
device as defined in the appended claims.The invention will be described in more detail below
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the inside of a movable
component of the device;Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the outside of a
fixed component;Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the outside of the
movable component;Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the inside of the
fixed component;Fig. 5 is a sectional view of the fixed component
taken along the line V-V in Fig. 4; and Fig. 6 schematically illustrates the operation of the
inventive device in association with a chain conveyor for
test tubes, forming a luminescence measuring system.The luminometer comprises a cup-shaped component 1
which is fixedly mounted on a frame, and a cup-shaped component
2 which is rotatable round the fixed component 1
about a common axis and which forms a lid for the fixed
component 1 when an annular flange or side wall 3 of the
fixed component has been fitted into an annular groove 4
in the movable component 2. The annular flange 3 encloses
a measuring chamber 5 in the fixed component 1. This chamber
can be accommodated in a space 6 in

<CLAIMS>
A luminescence measuring system comprising

a conveyor (26) for containers (25) with samples to
be subjected to luminescence measurements, and
a luminometer (1, 2) arranged to receive the containers
one after the other from the conveyor and comprising

two mutually displaceable components (1, 2) having
holes (11, 12, 14, 15) for admitting, under the action of

gravity, a container into a measuring chamber (5) defined
by said components, as well as holes for removing the container

from the measuring chamber,

   wherein

the conveyor comprises a translationally drivable
chain of tubular sleeves (27), each adapted to receive

a container, and a bottom (28) provided with a hole (29),
said chain of sleeves being adapted to be displaced along

the bottom above the hole (29) for dropping a container
through said hole under the action of gravity, and
the luminometer is arranged below said bottom and the
mutually displaceable components thereof (1, 2) are both cup-shaped,

their open ends fitting into one another such that the cup bottoms face
outwards, the side walls of said components exhibiting

said admission holes as well as other holes (11', 12', 16,
17) which can be brought into alignment with each other by said displacement

for discharging the container from the measuring
chamber and the luminometer under the action of gravity.

claim 1, 
characterised
 in that said components
(1, 2) are mutually displaceable by rotation.
A luminescence measuring system as set forth in
claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
 in that the two
cup-shaped components (1, 2) both have double side walls.
A luminescence measuring system as set forth in
any one of claims 1-3, 
characterised
 in that
the inner side wall (9) of the one cup-shaped component is 

covered by a top (10) and defines the measuring chamber
(5).
A luminescence measuring system as set forth in
any one of claims 1-4, 
characterised
 in
that said top (10) is provided with a guide (23) for a

spring-loaded cam (20) projecting from the bottom of the
other component and adapted to sense, respectively, the

presence and the absence of a test tube in the measuring
chamber (5).
