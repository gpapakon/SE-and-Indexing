<DESCRIPTION>
Interlocking divider panels are utilized to provide a self-supporting 
grid structure which divides a cargo space into a 
plurality of desired size compartments. Almost all automotive vehicles in use today provide some 
type of cargo storage space. Pickup trucks have beds which 
provide storage space. Vans make storage space available on 
floor areas in and around rear seating areas. Automobiles have 
enclosed trunks or flat areas behind the seats which may be 
utilized as storage space. Although such storage spaces allow some items to be 
conveniently transported within a vehicle, these spaces are 
inconvenient for storage of items which spill easily if tipped or 
which do not tend to remain in one position in the cargo storage 
space when the vehicle is in motion. These items may include 
grocery bags, liquid containers, tools, advertising brochures, 
salesperson's samples, briefcases, suitcases, sports equipment, 
etc. The problem stems from the fact that most vehicle cargo 
storage spaces are little more than a horizontal planer floor or 
bed area enclosed by vertical walls which define the perimeter of 
the cargo spaces. For the most part, the distances between the 
walls defining the spaces are far too great to provide any type  
 
of restraint to horizontal movement of items stored within the 
space. Grocery bags set in a pickup truck bed, a van floor or an 
automobile trunk almost invariably tip over when the vehicle is 
in motion. Similarly, a sport's item such as a bowling ball will 
roll or slide across the horizontal surface of a cargo storage 
space during the time the vehicle is in motion because of lack of 
restraint. Of course there are many other items which will 
behave in a similar manner when placed upon the planer surface of 
a cargo space during movement of the vehicle. Cargo stored within a vehicle storage area may be prevented 
from spilling, rolling, sliding or otherwise moving across the 
planer surface of the space by utilizing one of a number of 
different types of restraints. Cargo may be fastened in place by 
means of a rope, a resilient cord known by the trademark Bungie 
Cord, a strap, etc. These restraints are inconvenient and 
difficult to apply to many items. Items also may be restrained 
by vertical barriers such as nets or rigid, vertical, cargo space 
divider elements. One problem with making a suitable vehicle cargo space 
divider structure resides in the fact that cargo spaces have many 
different dimensions. Consequently, it becomes difficult to 
provide a cargo
