<ABSTRACT>
Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are produced from a low 
molecular weight hydrocarbon by contact thereof, at high temperature 

in the presence of oxygen, or steam and oxygen, with a fluidized bed 
comprising particulate, essentially nonleachable barium hexaluminate 

in admixture with a particulate catalyst containing a metal, e.g. 
nickel, catalytic for synthesis gas production.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production of 
hydrogen and carbon monoxide from hydrocarbons in high temperature 
reactions utilizing fluidized beds of 
admixtures of synthesis gas generation catalysts and heat 
transfer solids. Particulate refractory inorganic oxide solids, e.g. alumina, 
have been employed for many years as catalyst supports, or carriers, 
in natural or synthetic form. For example, synthesis gas, or syn gas 
(hydrogen and carbon monoxide) is produced from low molecular weight 
hydrocarbons, primarily methane, by contact with a bed of fluidized 
catalyst, e.g. nickel on an alumina support, in the presence of steam 
(steam reforming process), or oxygen (partial oxidation process), or 
both steam and oxygen, at high temperature. Suitably, particulate 
refractory inorganic oxide solids, notably alpha alumina solids, are 
admixed with the catalyst of the fluidized bed as heat transfer solids 
to control the temperature of reaction. Processes wherein low 
molecular weight hydrocarbons are converted to syn gas within the 
presence of both steam and oxygen offer particular advantages in that 
the syn gas can be better controlled to provide hydrogen:carbon 
monoxide ratios particularly suitable for conducting Fischer-Tropsch 
reactions; i.e. about 2:1. Fluidized bed processes offer particular advantages in that 
they provide superior heat, and mass transfer characteristics as 
contrasted with fixed bed processes. They permit substantially 
isothermal reactor conditions in conducting exothermic and endothermic 
reactions, provided that the fluidized characteristics of the bed can 
be maintained throughout the operation. To maintain the required 
fluidization characteristics, it is essential that the particulate bed 
solids have the capacity to resist melting and agglomeration at the 
high temperatures required for syn gas operations. Sintering and 
agglomeration of the solids reduce fluidization quality, produce large  
 
gas bubbles, and decrease mass transfer. Moreover, the particulate 
bed solids must mechanically withstand the stress and strain of 
process operations since the amount of mechanical fracturing and 
attrition of the particles that can be tolerated is severely limited. 
Process economics often militates against the use of devices which 
prevent the escape of any fines from the process, and generally, with 
the devices that are used, some fines are lost from the reactor. In a fluidized bed operation a gas, or gases, must be 
injected upwardly into the bed at
