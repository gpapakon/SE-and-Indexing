<ABSTRACT>
An assay for determining the presence of HCV IgM in a test sample. A test sample is contacted with at least one HCV antigen, incubated to form antigen/antibody complexes, and then contacted with an indicator reagent in order to produce a detectable signal. The amount of HCV IgM present in the test sample is proportional to the signal generated. The assay also can include the step of contacting the complexes with an enhancer compound prior to the use of an indicator reagent. Also provided is a test kit useful for performing the assay of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMMUNOASSAY FOR DETECTING HCV IyM ANTIBODYBackground of the InventiopThis invention relates generally to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and more particularly, relates to the detection of HCV IgM in test samples.Greater than 90% of cases of transfusion hepatitis worldwide are attributed to non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). The predominant etiological agent of NANBH, termed Hepatitis C virus (HCV), has been cloned. An immunodominant region designated as c-100, encoded by the putative nonstructural (NS)-4 genomic region, has been expressed, purified, and incorporated into immunoassays which are useful in the detection of antibody to HCV in infected test samples. See, for example, Q.-L. Choo et al., Science 244:359-362 (1989); H. J. Alter et al., N. Engl. J. Msd. 321:1494-1500 (1989); J. I. Esteban et al., Lancet ii:294-297 (1989); G. Huo et al., Science 244:362-364 (1989); T. Miyamura et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:983-987 (1990); and C. L. Van der Poel et al., Lancet Ï‹:297-298 (1989).Recently, a study of 20 well-documented cases of post-transfusionNANBH reported that the mean delay to the development of anti-HCV was 21.9 weeks after transfusion and 15 weeks after the onset of hepatitis Alter et al., supra. Seroconversion occurred after six months in 40% of these cases and at approximately one year in one patient. Similar result have been reported for post-transfusion NANBH by J. I. Esteban et al., supra, and for chimpanzees that were experimentally infected with the Hepatitis C Virus by Y. K. Shimizu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:6441-6444 (1990). The delay in seroconversion to anti-HCV detected by recombinant clOO antigen may account for its relatively low prevalence (15-30%) in individuals diagnosed with acute NANBH. Thus, anti-HCV- negative cases may actually be caused by HCV infection that does not elicit an immune response detectable by current anti-HCV c-100 assays (the so-called first generation assays).Whereas previous studies have established HCV as the primary cause of transfusion-associated hepatitis, immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to HCV detected by the HCV c-100 antigen are likely to be 

absent during acute infection. Vallari et al. recently have discovered that the addition of recombinant HCV CORE and HCV NS3 (33c) polypeptides to IgG anti-HCV assays significantly reduces the post-transfusion period when anti-HCV is undetected. D. Vallari et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1991, submitted for publication). In this study, the earliest IgG response to HCV was detected more
