<ABSTRACT>
A ferrofluid controlled switch for a light pipe has a 
light pipe (10) having a first index of refraction, a fluid 

(18) responsive to a magnetic field having a second index of 
refraction, and an enclosure (14) concentrically located 

around at least a portion of the light pipe for retaining 
the fluid such that the fluid is capable of assuming two 

configurations, one adjacent to the light pipe and one 
separate from the light pipe. A controllable magnetic field 

device (22,23) such as a permanent magnet or wire coils are 
used to transfer the magnetically responsive fluid (18) 

between said two configurations to reduce the output of the 
light pipe (18) when the fluid is adjacent to the light 

pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a switch for
a light pipe, and more specifically to a device for
modulating the intensity of light travelling through a light
pipe using ferrofluid to scatter the evanescent field of the
light in the light pipe.In the operation of light pipes it is often desirable
to control the intensity of the light propagating in the
light pipe. When using high intensity discharge lamps as
the light source for light distribution via light pipes, it
is desirable to control the light in the light pipe without
modulating the light source. Several methods have been used
in the past to control the modulation of the light through
the light pipe.A light switch using ferrofluid is described in US
Patent 4,384,761. The light pipe is physically separated by
a chamber containing ferrofluid. When the coil near the end
of the light pipe is energised, the two light pipes cease to
be optically coupled. Several problems exist with a system
that breaks the continuity of the light pipe. For example,
the intensity of propagating light is reduced when the light
travels through media with different indices of refraction.
The present invention seeks further improvements in
manufacturability.It is a primary advantage of the present invention that
light modulation is achieved without breaking the optical
continuity of the light pipe in an easily manufactured
switch.According to claim 1 the present optical switch
includes a light pipe having a first index of refraction,
fluid responsive to a magnetic field having a second index
of refraction, and an enclosure concentrically located
around at least a portion of the light pipe for retaining 
the fluid so that the fluid is capable of assuming two
configurations, one adjacent to the light pipe and one
separate from the light pipe. A controllable magnetic field
device such as a permanent magnet or wire coils are used to
transfer the magnetically responsive fluid between the two
configurations to selectably reduce the light transmission
of the light pipe when the fluid is adjacent to the light
pipe.The invention will now be described further, by way of
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in
which:
Figure 1 is an axial cross section of a light pipe of
the present invention.Figure 2 is a longitudinal cross section of a light
pipe of the present invention in the on state;Figure 3 is a longitudinal cross section of a light
pipe of the present invention in the off state, andFigure 4 is an alternative embodiment of the present
invention having
