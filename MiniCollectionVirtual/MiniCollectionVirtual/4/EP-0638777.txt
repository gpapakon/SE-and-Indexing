<ABSTRACT>
Liquid lines (5LA, 5LB) and gas lines (5GA, 5GB) are connected to a main liquid line (4L) and to a main gas 
line (4G), respectively, so that a master outdoor unit (2A) and a slave outdoor unit (2B) can be connected in parallel. 

The gas line (5GB) for the outdoor unit (2B) is provided with a gas stop valve (V2) which is fully closed when the 
slave outdoor unit (2B) is not in heating mode. The liquid line (5LB) for the outdoor unit (2B) is provided with a 

liquid stop valve (V1) which is fully closed when the slave outdoor unit (2B) is not in either cooling or heating mode. 
This construction can prevent liquid compression and insufficiency of a cooling medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refrigeration apparatus
having a plurality of thermal source units.Conventionally, there has been known an air conditioner
as a refrigeration apparatus in which a plurality of indoor
units are connected in parallel with one another through
refrigerant piping with respect to a single outdoor unit in
order to form multi-type indoor units, as disclosed in the
Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Gazette No.4-208370. The
outdoor unit has a compressor, a four-way selector valve, an
outdoor heat exchanger, an outdoor motor-operated expansion
valve and a receiver. The indoor unit has an indoor motor-operated
expansion valve and an indoor heat exchanger.At a cooling operation, a refrigerant discharged from the
compressor is circulated, so as to be condensed at the outdoor
heat exchanger, reduced in pressure at the indoor motor-operated
expansion valve, evaporated at the indoor heat exchanger
and then returned to the compressor. At a beating operation, a
refrigerant discharged form the compressor is circulated, so
as to be condensed at the indoor heat exchanger, reduced in 
pressure at the outdoor motor-operated expansion valve,
evaporated at the outdoor heat exchanger and then returned to
the compressor.Further, in the outdoor unit, the capacity of the compressor
is regulated according to the load of the indoor unit.In the above-mentioned air conditioner, since only a
single outdoor unit is provided, it is required that many
kinds of outdoor units having different capacities from one
another are produced in correspondence with the indoor load,
i.e., the number of indoor units to be connected. In addition,
when the indoor load does not accord with the capacity of the
outdoor unit, the capacity of the outdoor unit is disadvantageously
increased in spite of a small indoor load.To cope with the above problems, a plurality of outdoor
units, for example, two outdoor units, having different capacities
from one another, may be combined with one another in
order to form multi-type outdoor units.In such a case, when the outdoor unit under cooling or
heating operation and the outdoor unit in deactivation exist
at the same time, the refrigerant must be prevented from being
stored in the outdoor unit in deactivation in order that a
fixed circulation amount of refrigerant is retained. That is, 
it is necessary to prevent lack of a circulation amount of
refrigerant.Further, when one of the outdoor units is deactivated
during heating operation, a large amount of gas refrigerant
can be condensed in
