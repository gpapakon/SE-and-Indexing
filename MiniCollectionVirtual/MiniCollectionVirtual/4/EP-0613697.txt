<ABSTRACT>
A packaging comprises a sealed peel-apart flexible 
pouch (4) in 
which the preshaped stem (101) of a medical 
appliance is maintained by elastic pressure of the 

walls of a sheath (60) open at its ends formed by a 
wall (61) having two parallel lateral edges forming 

slides (8) in which are engaged the lateral edges of 
two spaced apart portions of a second wall (71-72). 

The two walls (61, 71-72) are flat and deformable by 
their own elasticity. The spacing between the two portions 

of the second wall (71-72) constitutes a retaining 
window (100) for a handling and connecting hub (3) 

connected to the stem (101).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a packaging for an elongated 
medical appliance, such as for instance a catheter 
or a fiber optic surgical unit which have to be unpacked 
under sterile conditions, having at least a stem of 
predetermined shape connected to a handling and connecting 
hub, said packaging comprising a sealed peel-apart 
flexible pouch, an elongated support member inside 
the pouch, said support member being longer than the 
medical appliance, means for maintaining the stem 
and means for retaining the hub, said means for maintaining 
the stem and means for retaining the hub being 
capable to give way in order to permit withdrawal 
of the medical appliance. The known packagings of that kind are designed to 
protect the medical appliance against the risks of 
contamination as well as those of shocks and deformation 
during storage and transit. They are also designed 
to facilitate withdrawal of the medical appliance 
in conditions appropriate to preserve sterility, in 
particular of the portions of the stem which have 
to be inserted into a patient, and to preserve as 
well the predetermined shape of the stem. Within this frame, the sealed flexible pouch protects 
the medical appliance against the risks of contamination 
while the support member is intended to maintain the 
medical appliance and to protect it against shocks, 
its length being greater than that of the medical 
appliance in order to avoid that the extremities thereof 
run through the flexible pouch. The means for maintaining the stem and retaining the 
hub on the support member differ as they may be integrated 
to the support or partly integrated thereto and 
partly fitted in an adaptable piece essentially intended 
to maintain the shape of the stem.  
 When such means are integrated to the support member, 
they generally consist of grooves the contour of which 
corresponds to the contour of the stem, and the stem 
is maintained within these grooves by retaining tongues 
respectively located on both sides of such grooves, 
which tongues give way to the stem upon raising thereof. 
The support member also comprises a hollow housing 
in which the hub is immobilized in the plane of the 
support member, withdrawal of the hub being achieved 
by merily lifting it. Of course, there is needed a 
different support member for each different shape 
of the stem and hub. Upon use of the medical appliance, one person first 
peels apart the pouch at least up to the level of 
the hub; another person then grasps the hub and lifts 
it out of its

<CLAIMS>
A packaging for an elongated medical appliance having 
at least a stem (1) of predetermined shape connected to 

a handling and connecting hub (3), said packaging comprising 
a sealed peel-apart flexible pouch (4), an elongated support 

member (6) inside the pouch, said support member being 
longer than the medical appliance, means for maintaining 

the stem and means for retaining the hub, said means 
for maintaining the stem and means for retaining the 

hub being capable to give way in order to permit withdrawal 
of the medical appliance, characterized in that 

the support member is a sheath (6, 60, 11, 13) with 
open ends formed by two flat walls (61-62, 71-72, 110-111) 

which are superposed and deformable by their own 
elasticity, which walls are connected to each other 

at their lateral edges, said walls being at a distance 
from one another which is smaller than the minimal 

thickness of the stem (1, 2, 101) of the medical appliance, 
and said sheath having on at least one of said 

two flat walls a retaining window (10, 100, 12, 14) 
for partly housing the hub (3). 
A packaging according to claim 1, characterized 
in that one of the two flat walls (61) of the sheath 

(6, 60) comprises two parallel lateral edges forming 
slides (8) in which the two lateral edges of the other 

wall (62, 71-72) are slidingly engaged. 
A packaging according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the wall the two edges of which are engaged 

in the slides (8) of the other wall (61) comprises 
the retaining window (10, 100) for the hub (3). 
A packaging according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the wall (71-72) engaged into the slides (8) 

of the other wall (61) is divided in two portions spaced  
 

apart from one another in the longitudinal direction 
of the sheath (60), wherein the spacing between these 

two portions forms the retaining window (100) for the 
hub (3). 
A packaging according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the slide structure of the two lateral edges 

of one of the two walls (61) of the sheath (6, 60) 
is made by a turned down U shaped fold (8) of each 

of said edges. 
A packaging according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the two walls (110, 111) of sheath (11) connected 

at their edges are forming one single piece the cross 
section of which is a continuous contour. 
A packaging according to claim 6, characterized 
in that the two walls (110, 111) of the sheath (11) 

have each a retaining window (12) for the hub, said 
windows being equal and superposed. 
A packaging according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the sheath (13) is divided in two portions 

(130, 131) having each a cross section which is a continuous 
contour, wherein these two portions are nested 

one into the other in the longitudinal direction of 
the sheath, and wherein at least one of the walls of 

one of these two portions comprises at one end an open 
cut (14) forming the retaining window for the hub (3) 

when the two portions are nested into each other.
