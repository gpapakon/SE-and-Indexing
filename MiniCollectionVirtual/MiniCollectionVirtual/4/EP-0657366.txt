<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a leaktight connection between a non-metallic container and a non-metallic lid which can be peeled off and reused. This leaktight connection, the lid being made of PP, is characterised in that: - the container (1) is made of a bilayer material, the outer layer (5) being made of PP, and the inner layer (6) being made of PP-PE alloy containing from 30 to 70% of PE and including a relief or circular segment (2) of convex shape at the lip. This invention is applicable in the field of packaging, in particular for fresh dairy produce.

Tight packaging formed by a container (1) of non-metallic 
material and a peelable lid (3) of PP, said container (1) 

comprising a circular relief or bead (2) of convex shape in 
the region of the sealing rim, characterised in that said 

container (1) is of two-layered material (5, 6), the external 
layer (5) being of PP and the internal layer (6) of PP-PE 

alloy containing from 30 to 70% of PE so, during the tight 
sealing of the container (1) and of the lid (3), said internal 

layer (6) which is more flexible than said external layer and 
the layer of the lid (3) melts and yields in line with the 

bead (2), said external layer of PP therefore coming into 
contact with the layer of the lid made of PP and forming a 

tight seal. 
Packaging according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
thickness of the internal layer (6) represents from 5 to 30% 

of the total thickness of the two-layered material (5, 6). 
Packaging according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the width H of the bead (2) is between 

0.1 and 0.8 mm. 
Packaging according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the width B of the base of the bead (2) 

is between 0.5 and 2 mm. 
Packaging according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the PE used for making up the internal 

layer (6) is a linear or radical-like LDPE. 
Packaging according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
grade of the LDPE is between 2 and 30 in dg/min at 190Â°C under 

21.6 N, determined according to ASTM standard D1228/L. 
Packaging according to one of claims 1 to 6, in which 
said lid comprises at least three centring studs.
