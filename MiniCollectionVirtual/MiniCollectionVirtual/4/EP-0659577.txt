<ABSTRACT>
In a heat print device (50) for a stamp unit (1), a dummy 
stamp unit (130) is mounted on the heat print device to 

tentatively thermally print a character array of normal 
characters on the heat sensitive sheet (131) of a dummy stamp 

unit before a stamp unit is mounted on the heat print 
device to perform perforation printing of a character 

array of mirror characters of the normal characters on the 
print face portion (30) of a stamp unit. If the character array 

formed on the heat sensitive sheet of the dummy stamp is 
satisfactory with respect to the character array, the 

character size, and the arrangement of the character 
array, the stamp unit is mounted on the heat printing 

device to perform the perforation print of the character 
array of the mirror characters on the print face portion 

of the stamp unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat-print device for a
stamp unit, and particularly to a heat-print device for
performing perforation-printing in a dot pattern on a print
face portion of heat sensitive stencil paper of a stamp
unit and performing heat-printing in a dot pattern on a
heat-sensitive sheet on the surface of a platen portion of
a dummy stamp unit.There have been hitherto utilized various kinds of
stamps, each of which serves to print a company name, an
address or other character arrays on the surface of a
sheet, having a print face portion formed of rubber.
These types of stamps are individually made to order.
Thus, their price is expensive and an user must wait for a
long time to receive the stamp after ordering.EP-A-0562761 discloses a stamp apparatus in which a
continuous stencil is wound between a supply and a take-up
roller. A thermal head is provided for perforating the
stencil as it is wound into position in front of an ink
pad.In U.S. Patent No. 5,285,725, the applicant proposed
a stamping stencil which mainly contains a heat sensitive
stencil paper and an ink-impregnated member which is
impregnated with ink. The ink-impregnated member and a
frame, surrounding the ink-impregnated member, are
adhesively attached on one side to a synthetic resin film
and the heat sensitive stencil paper is adhesively attached
on the other surface of the ink-impregnated member and the
frame.A stamp unit comprising a stamp member and a stamping
stencil is obtained by adhesively attaching the stamping
stencil on the lower surface of the base portion of the
stamp member, having a grip portion, through a cushion
member and perforating the heat sensitive stencil paper to
form a pattern, such as a character array, using a thermal
head or the like.In U.S. Patent No. 5,253,581, upon which the
precharacterising portions of appended claims are based, there
is proposed a stamp device comprising a stamp unit and a heat 
print device for perforating a print face portion of the
stamp unit, the latter formed of heat sensitive stencil
paper.The stamp unit comprises a grip portion and a body
case. A supply reel and a take-up reel are accommodated
in the body case and serve to supply and wind a tape-shaped
heat sensitive stencil paper. An ink pad which is
part of the stamp unit, contacts the perforated heat
sensitive stencil paper.The heat print device includes a print mount
portion on which the stamp unit is freely detachably
mounted, a feed mechanism for feeding the heat sensitive
stencil paper of the stamp unit, a
