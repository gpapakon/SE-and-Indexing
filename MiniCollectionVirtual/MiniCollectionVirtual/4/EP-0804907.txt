<ABSTRACT>
A bifurcated stent for insertion into a bifurcated 
vessel such as a blood vessel. In one embodiment, a first sheet 

is formed into a first leg, a second sheet is formed into a 
second leg, a third sheet is formed into a stem, and the two legs 

are attached to the stem. In a second embodiment, a first sheet 
is formed into a member having a first leg and half of a stem, a 

second sheet is formed into a second member having a second leg 
and half of a stem, and the two stem halves are combined to form 

the bifurcated stent. In a third embodiment, the stent comprises 
two sections that are serially inserted and assembled within the 

vessel at the site of the bifurcation to be treated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to stents, and more
particularly to bifurcated stents.Stents are well known in the art. They are typically formed
of a cylindrical metal mesh which can expand when pressure is
internally applied. Alternatively, they can be formed of wire
wrapped into a cylindrical shape or sheets of material formed
into a cylindrical shape.Stents are devices which are usually implanted within bodily
conduits including the vascular system to reinforce collapsing,
partially occluded, weakened, or abnormally dilated sections of
the blood vessel. Stents also have been successfully implanted
in other areas, e.g., the urinary tract or the bile duct to
reinforce such bodily conduits.U.S. Patent No. 4,994,071 (MacGregor) discloses an
expandable, bifurcating stent having a main cylindrical lattice
formed from interconnected, flexible wire loops. Two additional cylindrical
lattices, having smaller diameters than the main lattice, are
similarly constructed. The main lattice includes a flexible wire
interconnecting the main lattice to one of the additional
lattices. A second flexible wire interconnects the main lattice 
to the other additional lattice. The flexible wires form
backbones that extend axially along the length of the main
lattice and along each of the additional lattices. One
disadvantage of this bifurcating stent is the complex nature of
the interconnection of the flexible wires forming the backbones
with the loop structure of each lattice.WO-A-95 21592 discloses a bifurcated endoluminal prosthesis comprising
a first stent that has two transversely spaced female cooperating portions,
each of which is adapted for connection to a male stent which, in use,
extends across the bifurcation into a respective one of the branched blood
vessels.The present invention solves these and other disadvantages
of the prior art by providing a bifurcated stent and
a system for forming
a bifurcated stent.  The bifurcated stent comprises first
and second tubular portions. The first portion has a proximal
end which forms the stem portion and a distal end which forms one
of the leg portions of the bifurcated stent. A branch aperture
is
formed in a sidewall
of the first portion and
disposed between the proximal end and the distal end of the
first portion. The second portion is introduced into the
longitudinal bore of the stem portion of the first portion and is
advanced through the branch aperture so that it protrudes beyond
the branch aperture to form a second leg. When the second
portion is expanded, the

<CLAIMS>
A system for forming a bifurcated stent, comprising a first expandable
tubular portion (110) and a second expandable tubular portion (140),

the first tubular portion (110) having a longitudinal bore (131), a single
proximal end (115) defining a stem portion (125), a single distal end (120)

defining a first leg portion (130), and a branch aperture (135) formed in a sidewall of the
first tubular portion (110) and disposed between the proximal end (115)

and the distal end (120), said branch aperture (135) communicating with
said longitudinal bore (131),

wherein the second tubular portion (140) is adapted to be advanced
through and to protrude beyond said branch aperture (135) to form a second

leg, wherein the second tubular portion (140) is sized and adapted to
engage and to be secured into the branch aperture (135) upon expansion.
A system for forming a bifurcated stent according to claim 1, wherein the

branch aperture (135) is suitable to be pushed outward to form a branch
securing lip (180).
A system for forming a bifurcated stent according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
the stem portion (125), the first leg portion (130) and the second leg portion

(140) are patterned or etched.
A bifurcated stent comprising a first expandable tubular portion (110) and
a second expandable tubular portion (140),

the first tubular portion (110) having a longitudinal bore (131), a single
proximal end (115) defining a stem portion (125), a single distal end (120)

defining a first leg portion (130), and a branch aperture (135) formed in a sidewall of the 
first tubular portion (110) and disposed between the proximal end (115)

and the distal end (120), said branch aperture (135) communicating with
said longitudinal bore (131),

the second tubular portion (140) being advanced through and protruding
beyond said branch aperture (135) to form a second leg, wherein the second

tubular portion (140) is engaged and secured into the branch aperture
(135) by expansion.
A bifurcated stent according to claim 4, wherein the branch aperture (135)
is pushed outward to form a branch securing lip (180).
