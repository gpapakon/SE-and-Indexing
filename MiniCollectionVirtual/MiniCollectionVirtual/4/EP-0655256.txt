<ABSTRACT>
An inhalation device including an aerosol 
generator for dispensing droplets of liquid medicament 

comprising a housing defining a liquid receptacle 
having an opening, a nozzle arrangement comprising a 

plurality of orifices, vibrating means for vibrating 
the nozzle arrangement, and means for introducing the 

liquid medicament on the outer surface of the nozzle 
arrangement. Control means are also provided for 

controlling the vibrating means such that when the 
liquid medicament is introduced on the outer surface 

of the nozzle arrangement, the nozzle arrangement may 
be vibrated to cause the liquid to enter the liquid 

receptacle through the orifices and thereafter be 
expelled from the orifices through the outer surface 

of the nozzle arrangement in the form of atomised 
droplets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inhalers for the 
delivery of therapeutic substances to the respiratory 
system of a patient and in particular to inhalers 
which deliver the therapeutic substance in the form of 
a liquid as a dispersion of fine droplets. Since the metered dose pressurised inhaler was 
introduced in the mid-1950's, inhalation has become 
the most widely used route for delivering 
bronchodilators, offering a rapid onset of action and 
a low instance of systemic side effects. More 
recently, inhalation from a pressurised inhaler has 
been a route selected for the administration of other 
drugs, e.g., ergotamine, which are not primarily 
concerned with the treatment of a bronchial malady. The metered dose inhaler is dependent upon the 
propulsive force of a propellant system used in its 
manufacture. The propellant generally comprises a 
mixture of liquified chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) which 
are selected to provide the desired vapour pressure 
and stability of the formulation. Propellants 11, 12 
and 114 are the most widely used propellants in 
aerosol formulations for inhalation administration. In recent years it has been established that 
CFC's react with the ozone layer around the earth and 
contribute towards its depletion. There has been 
considerable pressure around the world to reduce 
substantially the use of CFC's and various Governments 
have banned the "non-essential" use of CFC's. Such 
"nonessential" uses include the use of CFC's as 
refrigerants and blowing agents, but heretofore the 
use of CFC's in medicines, which contributes to less  
 
than 1% of the total use of CFC's, has not been 
restricted. Nevertheless, in view of the adverse 
effect of CFC's on the ozone layer it is desirable to 
seek alternative propellant systems which are suitable 
for use in inhalation aerosols or an inhaler which is 
capable of delivering drugs in such an efficacious 
manner without employing an aerosol propellant. W092/11050 discloses an inhaler device for 
dispensing droplets of liquid medicament to a 
patientomprising a body having a mouth piece or nasal 
adaptor, and a reservoir of liquid medicament in 
communication with an aerosol generator, the aerosol 
generator comprising a chamber for liquid medicament 
and a nozzle arrangement comprising a plurality of 
orifices in fluid flow relationship with liquid 
medicament in said chamber, means for cyclically 
pressurising the liquid medicament in said chamber 
such that liquid from said chamber is periodically 
expelled through the orifices as

<CLAIMS>
An aerosol generator for dispensing droplets 
of liquid medicament, comprising: 

   a housing defining a liquid receptacle having an 
opening; 

   a nozzle arrangement comprising a plurality of 
orifices, said nozzle arrangement having an outer 

surface and an inner surface facing the interior of 
the liquid receptacle and covering said opening; 

   vibrating means for vibrating the nozzle 
arrangement; 

   means for introducing liquid medicament on the 
outer surface of the nozzle arrangement; and 

   control means for controlling the vibrating means 
such that when liquid medicament is introduced on the 

outer surface of the nozzle arrangement the nozzle 
arrangement may be vibrated to cause the liquid to 

enter the liquid receptacle through the orifices and 
thereafter be expelled from the orifices through the 

outer surface in the form of atomised droplets. 
An aerosol generator as claimed in claim 1 
wherein said vibrating means comprises a piezoelectric 

element associated with said nozzle 
arrangement such that excitation of said piezoelectric 

element causes vibration of said nozzle 
arrangement. 
An aerosol generator as claimed in claim 2 
wherein said piezo-electric element is in the form of 

a ring secured to a metal disc, the metal disc having 
a central opening and being attached by its central 

portion to the nozzle arrangement or to the liquid 
receptacle adjacent the nozzle arrangement. 
An aerosol generator as claimed in claim 2 or 
3 wherein said vibrating means comprises means to 

excite the piezo-electric element at a resonant 
frequency within the frequency range of from about 10 

to about 500kHz. 
An aerosol generator as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein the diameter of the orifices 

is in the range of from about 2 to about 50µm. 
A method of dispensing droplets of liquid 
medicament comprising providing a liquid receptacle 

having an opening covered by a nozzle arrangement, the 
nozzle arrangement comprising a plurality of orifices 

and having an inner surface facing the interior of the 
liquid receptacle and an outer surface, introducing 

liquid medicament on the outer surface of the nozzle 
arrangement and vibrating the nozzle arrangement such 

that the liquid medicament on the outer surface of the 
nozzle arrangement is caused to enter the liquid 

receptacle through the orifices and thereafter be 
expelled from the orifices through the outer surface 

in the form of atomised droplets.
