<ABSTRACT>
A synthetic zeolite, designated zeolite GZS-11, is 
made having a molar composition expressed by the formula:



[x M
2/n
O + (1.0±0.2 - x)R
2/n
O] : Y₂O₃ : y XO₂: w H₂O



 
where M is an inorganic cation of valance n, R is an 

organic cation of valence n, "x" has a value of less than 
1.0, Y is one or more of +3 valence elements, such as 

aluminum, boron, gallium, iron, chromium, vanadium, 
molybdenum, or manganese, X is one or more of +4 valence 

elements, such as silicon, germanium, or titanium, "y" 
has a value of between 6 to 25, "w" has a value of up to 

4 depending upon the degree of hydration of the zeolite, 
and having an X-ray diffraction pattern of the assynthesized 

zeolite substantially as in Table 1. The 
method for making the low ratio of XO₂/Y₂O₃ such as 

SiO₂/Al₂O₃ is achieved by adjusting the synthesis mixture 
composition during the aging stage through the addition 

of one or more of the solutions containing the reactive 
sources of zeolitic components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a zeolite, 
hereinafter referred to as zeolite GZS-11, to a dynamic 
synthetic method of making it, and to processes using it 
as a catalyst. The synthesis of molecular sieves involves a variety 
of parameters, including gel composition, reaction 
temperature and pressure, reaction time, and the state of 
the synthesis gel (static or stirring, and stirring 
rate). Among these parameters, gel composition is 
probably the most significant, which contains important 
variables such as silicon/aluminum ratio, hydroxide 
concentration, inorganic and/or organic cation, and which 
determines in large part the structure and composition of 
the molecular sieve product. In the conventional 
synthesis of molecular sieves, the gel composition is 
defined at the very early stage when a synthesis gel is 
prepared. There has not been an intentional alteration 
of the gel composition during the aging of a synthesis 
gel until the formation of a molecular sieve is 
completed. Post-treatment has been used to modify the 
composition of molecular sieves. U. S. Pat. No. 
4,503,023 describes a process of extracting aluminum from 
AlO₄-tetrahedra of as-synthesized zeolite and substituting 
with silicon to form zeolite compositions having higher 
SiO₂/Al₂O₃ molar ratios. For example, zeolite Y has been 
treated by reacting with a solution containing (NH₄)₂SiF₆ 
to form LZ-210. In contrast to these prior art techniques, the  
 
present invention uses a gel composition which has its 
composition changed during the aging step to effectively 
alter the composition of the final product. By using 
this process unique forms of zeolite beta are made. Zeolite beta and its hydrothermal synthesis were 
first disclosed in U.S. Pat. 3,308,069, issued Mar. 7, 
1967, to R. L. Wadlinger et al. As disclosed therein, 
zeolite beta has a chemical composition in its assynthesized 
form expressed in terms of molar oxide ratios 
of

[x Na₂O + (1.0±0.1 - x)TEA₂O] : Al₂O₃ : y SiO₂: w H₂O


 
where "x" has a value of less than 1.0, "y" has a value 
of greater than 10 but less than 200, "w" has a value of 
up to 4 depending upon the degree of hydration of the 
zeolite, and TEA represents tetraethylammonium ion. The 
zeolite is said to be formed by crystallization at 
temperatures in the range of 75°C to 200°C, from an 
aqueous reaction mixture containing tetraethylammonium 
hydroxide and reactive sources of Na₂O, Al₂O₃, and SiO₂, 
with a composition of the reaction mixture, expressed in 
terms of mol ratios of oxides,
