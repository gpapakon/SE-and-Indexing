<ABSTRACT>
A stain resistant, easily cleanable and flexible 
plastic coated film comprising a base film and a coating 

thereon wherein the base film comprises a polyvinyl 
chloride resin, a polymeric plasticizer, and a member 

selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile-butadiene 
copolymer rubber and ethylene-n-butyl 

acrylate-carbon monoxide polymer and the coating 
comprises polymethyl methacrylate alone or together with 

a flexibilizing polymer such as vinyl chloride-vinyl 
acetate copolymer and/or a flexibilizing copolymer of 

methyl methacrylate. The coated film gives superior oil 
and stain resistance as compared to the base film or 

coating alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a flexible, alloyed, polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) resin film, also referred to simply as PVC/alloy 
film, which is coated with an acrylic stain resistant coating. 
The coated film resists staining, is oil and grease resistant and 
is easily cleanable. Combining the PVC/alloy film with the stain 
resistant acrylic coating gives superior oil and stain resistance 
than either the film or coating on its own. The coated film can be 
post laminated to various fabric substrates. PVC/alloys have been in existence for some time. PVC/NBR 
(acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber) alloys are used in automotive dash 
boards and door panels. Flexible PVC is laminated to various fabric substrates for use 
in upholstery, boat and machinery covers, table clothes, etc. 
These products do not last very long because dirt and stains are 
not cleanable from the vinyl surface. Oil and greases also extract 
plasticizer from the vinyl causing embrittlement and even cracking. 
There has been a long search for materials that will increase the  
 
useful life of the laminated vinyl. Currently, flexible PVC laminated fabric products consist of 
monomeric plasticized PVC film coated with a vinyl, vinyl/acrylic 
or urethane topcoat. Staining agents migrate through the coating 
and into the plasticizer of the PVC film. This creates a permanent 
stain. Stain resistant products currently on the market are only 
marginally more effective than conventional plasticized PVC 
coated products. The present invention comprises a flexible PVC/alloy film 
coated with an acrylic stain resistant coating having sufficient 
flexibility for the intended application of the coated film. 
Briefly, this invention involves the formation of a base film by 
alloying PVC resin with an acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber 
(NBR) for interior applications or alloying the PVC resin with an 
ethylene-n-butyl acrylate-carbon monoxide polymer for exterior 
applications. The alloyed film is then coated with an acrylic 
coating of: (1) polymethyl methacrylate (homopolymer) for end uses 
such as wall coverings which normally do not require high 
flexibility such as frequent creasing; or (2) the polymethyl 
methacrylate together with flexibilizing polymers such as a methyl 
methacrylate copolymer and/or a vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate  
 
copolymer for applications requiring more flexibility or creasing. 
One application requiring extensive flexibility and creasing is 
that of seat cushions wherein the flexibilizing polymer is 
preferably a copolymer
