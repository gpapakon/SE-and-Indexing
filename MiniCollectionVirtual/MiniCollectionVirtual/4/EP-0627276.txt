<ABSTRACT>
An elongate first component (1) for friction joining 
to a second component (2) by urging the components together 

while causing relative heat generating movement between 
them. The first component has a leading portion (3) which 

enters the second component (2) in use and is connected to 
a trailing portion which abuts but does not enter the 

second component after joining. The penetration length of 
the leading portion is not less than, preferably 

substantially equal to, a lateral dimension of at least 
that part of the trailing section adjacent the second 

component after joining. In another example, the leading 
portion of the first component is provided with a plurality 

of re-entrant cavities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of friction joining 
materials and to a component for use in such methods. Friction welding is well known both for similar and 
for dissimilar materials where in particular, under 
compressive load and with suitable relative motion, the 
interface is heated until a plasticised layer is produced 
which on arrest of movement solidifies and joins the 
components in a solid phase bond. Commonly friction welding is achieved between opposing 
bars or tubes under a common axial load and with relative 
rotation. In addition friction welding is obtained in a T 
geometry as in a stud to plate configuration where the stud 
is rotated and applied under load to the plate. In WO 93/10935 published on 10 June 1993, we describe 
friction welding methods in some of which one of the 
components is plunged into the other component and remains 
in situ thereafter. These components have a small probe 
portion, or consist of a small bush, which is received in 
the other component. In accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention, an elongate first component for friction joining 
to a second component by urging the components together 
while causing relative heat generating movement between 
them whereby the first component displaces heated material 
of the second component so that a leading portion of the 
first component enters into the second component, the 
displaced material of the second component being allowed to 
solidify around the leading portion of the first component, 
the leading portion being connected to a trailing portion 
which does not enter the second component after joining, 
the penetration length of the leading portion being not 
less than, preferably substantially equal to, a lateral 
dimension of at least that part of the trailing section 
adjacent the second component after joining.  This aspect of the invention leads to a particularly 
strong connection between the first and second components 
with a low electrical resistance in view of the particular 
relationship between the penetration length of the leading 
portion of the first component and the lateral dimension of 
the trailing section of the first component, at the surface 
of the second component. In conventional friction welding, the mechanical and 
in particular the electrical performance is limited by the 
common cross-section of the mating surfaces which is 
substantially that of the bar, tube or stud concerned. 
With respect to electrical connections between conducting 
material such as aluminium
