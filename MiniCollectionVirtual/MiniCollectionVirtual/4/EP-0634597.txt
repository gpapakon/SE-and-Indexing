<ABSTRACT>
Pipe with high impermeability in relation to hydrocarbons, comprising at least one internal layer (A) and one external layer (B) concentric with the internal layer (A), both layers being made of thermoplastic, in which pipe the external layer (B) is a barrier layer consisting of at least two immiscible thermoplastic substances, one of which is impermeable and dispersed into the other constituents of this layer (B) so as to form therein a plurality of lamella (laminations) which are substantially parallel to the wall of the pipe. The pipe may possibly be reinforced by at least one fibrous reinforcing structure, for example by at least one filamentary winding or fibrous fabric, the external barrier layer (B) then furthermore fulfilling a role of mechanical protection and making it possible to improve the external calibration. Such a pipe is advantageously used for the distribution of drinking water through pipelines which are buried in possibly contaminated ground.
