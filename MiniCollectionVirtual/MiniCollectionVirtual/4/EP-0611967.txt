<ABSTRACT>
This invention discloses an acceleration sensor, in which reliable insulation is provided between a movable electrode and a 
fixed electrode, so that influences of noise is reduced to improve detection accuracy and detection sensitivity of acceleration. A 

lower substrate (2) made of an insulating material is disposed on the lower surface side of an upper substrate (1) made of a silicon 
material having a small resistivity, and an insulating trench (5) penetrating through the upper substrate (1) from its upper surface 

side to its lower surface side is disposed in the upper substrate (1) throughout the periphery of a support beam (4). Accordingly, 
the support beam (4) and each fixed portion (6) opposing the support beam (4) are separated from each other using the upper 

substrate (1). As a result, the support beam (4) having a low resistance and each fixed portion (6) are electrically insulated from 
each other by the insulating trench (5). A mass portion (4C) forms a movable electrode and each fixed portion (6) forms a fixed 

electrode. When the mass portion (4C) undergoes displacement in accordance with acceleration, the change of the electrostatic 
capacitance between the electrodes is outputted as an acceleration signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an acceleration sensor 
which can be suitably used for detecting the degree of 
acceleration of a moving body, for example, of a motor 
vehicle or the like, and more particularly to an 
acceleration sensor of the type which employs a cantilever 
type support beam to be displaced in a horizontal 
direction according to the degree of acceleration. As disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Specification 62-232171, for example, conventional 
cantilever type acceleration sensors generally include, in 
or on a silicon substrate, a support beam which is fixed 
at its base end and has a mass portion in its fore free 
end portion to be displaced together with the silicon 
substrate in a horizontal direction according to the 
degree of acceleration, a substantially U-shaped groove 
opened through the upper and lower sides of the silicon 
substrate in such a manner as to circumvent the peripheral 
edges of the support beam except the fixed base end 
thereof, a stationary section defined by the  
 
just-mentioned groove as an integral part of the silicon 
substrate around and with a predetermined spacing from the 
peripheral edges of the support beam, a movable electrode 
formed on the support beam by means of a p-type diffusion 
layer of low resistance provided on the surface of the 
silicon substrate, and a stationary electrode formed 
similarly on the stationary section in face to face 
relation with the support beam. Further, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Specification 
60-159658 discloses another conventionl acceleration 
sensor which employs a support beam having its fixed base 
end integrally connected with the substrate and having a 
mass portion on its fore end portion for displacement in a 
horizontal direction according to the degree of 
acceleration, a stationary section formed on one side of 
the support beam by a recess substantially of U-shape, a 
movable electrode formed on a lateral side surface of the 
support beam by a vapor deposition process or the like, 
and a stationary electrode formed on a lateral side 
surface of the stationary section in face to face relation 
with the side surface of the support beam. The support beam in each of the above-described 
conventional acceleration sensors is designed to have a 
smaller dimension in width than in thickness for the 
purpose of imparting directionability in a particular  
 
direction pertaining to the detection of acceleration. 
While the support beam is displaced horizontally together 
with the silicon substrate, a
