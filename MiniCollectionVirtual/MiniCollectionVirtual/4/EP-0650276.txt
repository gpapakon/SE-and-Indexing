<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for testing a telecommunications network of ATM type and for measuring the connection performance of the network, this network transporting information in cell form in accordance with the ATM standard. To do that, the apparatus includes a sender (ET), equipped with an assembly for setting up a physical channel (100, 300, 500) and with an assembly for setting up the ATM transport layer (100, 200) which is organised into virtual paths and virtual channels (VP/VC), a receiver (RP) equipped with an assembly for processing the signals of the physical layer (600) and with an assembly for processing the flow of cells of the ATM transport layer (700, 800, 900). Application to telecommunications in ATM mode.
