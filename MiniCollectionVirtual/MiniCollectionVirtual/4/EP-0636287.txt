<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to control systems for the control of noise and vibration. Resonators (3) with adjustable properties are used in conjunction with an electronic control system (7) to change the noise or vibration in a structure (1). The invention relates particularly to the control of quasi-periodic noise or vibration comprising one or more harmonics by using one or more adaptive resonators (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
Many machines, such as internal combustion engines, generate unwanted 
noise and vibration. The vibration typically comprises a fundamental 
component whose frequency is, for example, the rotation frequency of 
the machine (this is called the first harmonic), plus one or more 
additional harmonics at frequencies that are integer multiples of the 
first. Occasionally, the speed of a machine is more-or-less constant and it 
is then possible to reduce vibration caused by the machine with a 
"tuned damper", or "resonator" (the two terms are used 
interchangeably here). A tuned damper is a resonant system that is 
attached to a point where vibration is to be reduced, and it is built 
to resonate at or close to the frequency of the vibration. Purely 
passive tuned dampers have fixed characteristics, and will work only 
close to the frequency for which they are designed. At the resonance 
frequency, the input impedance of the resonator (defined as the ratio 
of a generalized force applied by the resonator at the point of 
attachment to a generalized velocity at the same point) will be 
exceptionally high (or in some cases, such as a Helmholtz resonator 
in a duct, exceptionally low: see the description in L E Kinsler, A R 
Frey, A B Coppens, J V Sanders "Fundamentals of Acoustics" 3rd ed. 
Wiley and Sons 1982 pp 241-242). As an example of a tuned damper, a mass suspended on a spring will 
resonate at a characteristic resonance frequency. If the spring is 
attached to a structure vibrating at this resonance frequency, the 
amplitude of vibration of the structure at that point will be reduced 
(and as a consequence, the suspended mass will vibrate strongly). 
Similar effects can be described for acoustic resonators (eg. 
Helmholtz resonators; L E Kinsler, A R Frey, A B Coppens, J V Sanders 
"Fundamentals of Acoustics" 3rd ed. Wiley and Sons 1982. pp 225-228) 
where sound pressure is the vibration to be reduced.  
 The disadvantage with passive tuned dampers is that they will work 
only close to one frequency, and if the frequency of the vibration 
drifts, the damper will cease to be effective. It is obvious that a 
damper whose characteristics can be adjusted with the frequency of 
vibration to be reduced would be an advantage. Implicit here is the 
concept that the period of the vibration varies only slowly, so that 
it takes many cycles of the vibration for the period of the vibration 
to change significantly (ie. a "quasi-periodic" system). There have been many schemes for the adjustment of tuned dampers.

A noise or vibration control system for controlling 
noise or vibration from one or more noise sources (2), comprising: 


one or more adaptive resonator means (3), attached to 
one or more points on a structure (1), the resonance frequencies 

of the resonator means being adjustable by control signals, 
one or more sensor means (6) on the source of vibration

A system as in claim 3, characterized by that the control

means (3) as it operates. 
A system as in claim 1, characterized by that the control 
system (7) aims either to minimize or to maximize quantities

to complement the resonator means (3) in reducing

A system as in one of the preceding claims, characterized 
by that the tuning of said one or more resonators (3) 

has reasonably no effect on the one or more sensor means (6) 
used to derive the frequencies of various components of the 

vibration.
