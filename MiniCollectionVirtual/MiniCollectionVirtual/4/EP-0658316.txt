<ABSTRACT>
In order to protect a fatty substance against oxidation, it is brought into the presence of plant matter containing phenolic antioxidants, by mixing the plant matter and the fatty substance at high temperature, then the mixture is pressed and clarified to obtain a stabilised liquid grease containing the antioxidants. In the case where a food containing a fatty substance is to be protected, the stabilised grease is incorporated into the fatty phase of the foodstuff.

<CLAIMS>
Process for protecting a fat from oxidation, in which
the fat to be protected is placed directly in contact

with a vegetable substance containing phenolic
antioxidants at an elevated temperature, characterised

in that the weight ratio of fat vegetable substance is
0.5 to 2.5 and that the mixture is physically hot

pressed at a pressure of greater than or equal to
40 bar.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
rosemary or sage is used as the starting vegetable

substance containing phenolic antioxidants.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the fat to be protected is selected from among animal

or vegetable fats susceptible to oxidation and
containing unsaturated fatty acids, in particular

chicken fat, lard and palm butter.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
mixing of the vegetable raw material and the fat to be

protected proceeds at an elevated temperature of 90 to
120Â°C.
Process according to claim 4, characterised in that
mixing is performed in the presence of water by adding

10 to 20 wt.% of water, relative to the vegetable
substance, to the mixture.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the vegetable substance is subjected to enzymatic

pretreatment by incubating it with a glucanase in an
aqueous medium, then the suspension is filtered or

centrifuged and the vegetable substance treated in
this manner is dried. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
hot pressing is performed in a piston press equipped

with a filter cage which allows pressing and
filtration to be performed in a single operation.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
pressing is performed in a screw press and, after

pressing, the extracted crude oil is clarified by
filtration or centrifugation in order to remove

suspended vegetable substance residues.
Use of a fat treated by the process according to one
of claims 1 to 9 as an antioxidant extract for

protecting an untreated fat from oxidation, in which
the extract contains 0.5 to 7 wt.% of antioxidant and

the said extract is added to the fat to be protected
in a quantity of 0.2 to 1 wt.%.
Use according to claim 9, in which the fat
constituting the extract is the same as the fat to be

protected.
