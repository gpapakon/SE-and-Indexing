<ABSTRACT>
A capillary flowcell (12) includes an optical axis, the optical axis being defined by, in sequential order, (a) a first (entrance) aperture (14), (b) a first lens (26), (c) a capillary tube (16) having its long axis centered across the optical axis, and (d) a second lens (28). The first lens (26) focuses electromagnetic radiation from the entrance aperture (14), passes through the inner diameter of capillary tube (16) thus maximizing the signal generated by the analyte within the capillary tube (16). The second lens (28) focuses electromagnetic radiation which has passed through the capillary tube (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved capillary flowcell apparatus for
measuring absorbance of radiation, especially optical radiation, in a
multiple wavelength detector (MWD).Optical absorbance across a capillary flowcell is used to determine
the presence and/or concentration of an analyte within the capillary.The basic optical configuration of a multiple wavelength detector is
different from that of a variable wavelength detector. However, each type of
detector is often configured as a dual beam design, with a flowcell
containing analyte(s) in one beam, and a reference flowcell in an alternate
reference beam. Such designs permit the determination of lower
concentrations of analyte by compensating, for example, for fluctuations in
source energy, and reduction of signal variation as a function of
wavelength. Electromagnetic radiation which is delivered through the
analyte 16 and to the detector 22 (i.e., the signal) competes with
electromagnetic radiation which is delivered to the detector 22 without
having passed through the analyte 16 (i.e., "noise").In a variable wavelength detector, broad-band optical radiation from
a source is passed through a wavelength selection device such as a
monochromator. A narrow, nearly monochromatic band of
electromagnetic radiation is selected and focused upon the entrance
aperture of the flowcell. Optical radiation which is not scattered or 
absorbed by the analyte(s) in the flowcell is transmitted through the
flowcell, and is converted to an electrical signal by a detector element. If
the detector element is sufficiently sensitive and of sufficient area to
intercept the transmitted optical beam, it is not necessary to refocus the
beam. Variable wavelength detectors of the prior art (which determine a
single wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, sλ), are shown in Figure 1
and in Figure 2.Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of the path of light
through a capillary flowcell in a variable wavelength detector.
Monochromatic light at a single wavelength (sλ) is emitted from an
electromagnetic radiation source 10. Electromagnetic radiation (shown as
arrows) enters the flowcell 12 by passing through a mask 13 at the entrance
aperture 14. The mask 13 is placed to restrict optical radiation which would
not pass through the inner diameter of the capillary (and thus the analyte)
within the flowcell. The electromagnetic radiation passes through the
capillary tube wall 16 and through the analyte 18 contained within the
capillary tube. Electromagnetic radiation which has
