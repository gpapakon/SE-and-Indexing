<ABSTRACT>
An electrosurgical tool (10) comprises a retractable cutting blade (34) movable along a linear cutting path and an electrical energy supply source (26) which communicates electrical energy (e.g. radio frequency energy) through the cutting blade (34) and to tissue adjacent the cutting blade. During surgical procedures the electrosurgical cutting device (10) is able to simultaneously cut tissue and cauterize, or fuse, the tissue in areas adjacent the incision through the application of electrical energy. The effect is a reduced amount of bleeding associated with surgical procedures and an enhanced ability to control and eliminate bleeding. Optionally, the electrosurgical cutting device (10) may also include a supply of surgical staples (38) which are deployed simultaneously with the cutting action and delivery of electrosurgical energy to adjacent tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrosurgical tool which is adapted to
simultaneously cut, fuse, and cauterize the cut
tissue so as to improve hemostasis.Surgical procedures often require incisions
to be made in internal organs, such as the intestine,
causing profuse bleeding at the site of the
incision. Prompt control or elimination of the
bleeding is of paramount importance to the success
and safety of the procedure.Currently known surgical cutting devices
utilize different techniques to control or eliminate
bleeding. One known device is the Proximate Linear
Cutter available from the Ethicon, Inc. of
Sommerville, New Jersey. This device is specifically
adapted to make an incision in tissue or an organ
such as the intestine. The device engages a portion
of the tissue or organ between two tyne-like
members. To effect cutting, a blade mounted on one
of the tynes travels along a predetermined path,
thereby making a linear incision through the tissue
or organ. Simultaneously, surgical staples are
deployed by the cutting device on either side of the
incision, resulting in the separation of the organ 
into two segments, each of which is sealed adjacent
to the incision by surgical staples. Despite the use
of surgical staples and the precise cutting of the
tissue, bleeding is not entirely eliminated and
separate cauterization procedures must often be
utilized to control or stop bleeding.Surgical devices also are known which
utilize electrical current in the form of radio
frequency (RF) energy to cauterize tissue and to
prevent or control bleeding. U.S. Patent No.
4,651,734 discloses a surgical scalpel modified to
include an electrode. This scalpel has the ability
to cut tissue and, when properly positioned, to
cauterize tissue following a cutting procedure. Such
a surgical tool is useful but does not simultaneously
cut and cauterize tissue. The separate cauterization
procedure which must be utilized is relatively time
consuming and may result in unnecessary bleeding.
Moreover, such a scalpel is not well suited to many
surgical procedures such as the transection of the
intestine.Accordingly, there is a need for a surgical
tool which conveniently and safely enables precise
incisions to be made in internal organs, and which
simultaneously is able to eliminate essentially all
bleeding which results from the incision.It is thus an object of the invention to
provide a surgical tool which has improved cutting
capability and which decreases some of the risk
associated with surgery by minimizing the amount of 
ble

the tissue-contacting portion (48), said tissue-contacting

portion being adapted to function as a return electrode.
A device (10) as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the first (18) and second
(20) tyne elements are substantially parallel and define a tissue engaging 

space (22) through which, in use, the blade (34) moves

A device as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2
further comprising:


a cartridge (38) for housing a plurality
of surgical staples (38), said cartridge (38)

being disposed on the first tyne element (18), on a
side thereof facing the second tyne element (20) and

having a longitudinal groove (40) therein to
accommodate passage of the cutting blade (34) ;
a means (45) for deploying the staples
substantially simultaneously with the cutting action of

the blade (34); and
a mandrel (50) for effecting closure of the
staples, the mandrel (50) being disposed on a 

side of the second tyne element (20) facing the
first tyne element (18).
A device (10) as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the
cartridge (38) contains dual, linear rows of

staple ejection ports (42) disposed on opposite sides
of the groove (40), with surgical staples

positioned to be ejected from the ports (42).
A device (10) as claimed in Claim 3 or Claim 4
wherein the second tyne element (20) further comprises a central groove

(52) which cooperates with the longitudinal groove (40)
of the cartridge (38).
