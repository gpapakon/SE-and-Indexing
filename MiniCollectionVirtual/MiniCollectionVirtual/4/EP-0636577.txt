<ABSTRACT>
A process for treating sodium hydroxide waste liquor 
containing aluminum, comprising the steps of: adding, to 

aluminum-containing sodium hydroxide waste liquor, at least 
one of MgO and Mg(OH)₂ in an amount of 0.5 to 3 moles with 

respect to 1 mole of aluminum to cause a reaction at 70°C 
or more; and separating and removing a precipitated 

magnesium-aluminum compound is disclosed. The present 
invention makes it possible to recover recyclable sodium 

hydroxide from an aluminum-containing sodium hydroxide 
waste liquor. Even if the recovering procedure is 

repeated, no carbonate ions are accumulated. Therefore, it 
is possible to prevent degradation of the treating solution 

containing sodium hydroxide. Further, the by-product is a 
useful compound, and thus, there is no problem in the 

reprocessing or disposal of the by-product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
treatment of aluminum-containing sodium hydroxide waste
liquor produced by treating aluminum articles with a sodium
hydroxide solution or the like, so as to recover recyclable
sodium hydroxide. Accordingly, the present invention may
be appropriately applied to the treatment of aluminum-containing
sodium hydroxide waste liquor derived from, for
example, the alkali washing solutions used in factories
manufacturing an aluminum sash or alumite, or used for dies
in aluminum extrusion factories.As the conventional treatment of aluminum-containing
sodium hydroxide waste liquors discharged when treating a
surface of or dissolving metal aluminum or aluminum alloys
with a sodium hydroxide solution, there were known hitherto
(1) the neutralization process by adding acid, and (2) the
process for recovering the aluminum hydroxide and sodium
hydroxide solution using the Bayer process. The above
process (1) is simple in procedure, but the sludge produced
by neutralization contains aluminum hydroxide as a main
ingredient and includes a large amount of water, so its
treatment is difficult. Further, it was not possible to
regenerate the sodium hydroxide for recycle. The above
process (2) required a long reaction time (for about 24 to
48 hours). Further, aluminum hydroxide was poorly
separated from sodium hydroxide, and thus, a relatively
large amount of aluminum was present in the recovered
sodium hydroxide solution. Therefore, various problems
occurred at the time of reuse of the recovered sodium
hydroxide solution, such as precipitation of aluminum
hydroxide and deposition on container walls as scale. If a
masking agent such as sodium gluconate was used to remedy
such defect, separation and recovery of the sodium 
hydroxide solution and aluminum hydroxide were not
possible.Under the circumstances, the present inventors and the
co-workers proposed a process for recovering calcium
aluminate and sodium hydroxide waste liquor, by adding
calcium hydroxide [Japanese Examined Patent Publication
(Kokoku) No. 54-4720]. In the process, aluminum was
precipitated and separated in the form of 3CaO-Al2O3-6H2O
from the aluminum-containing sodium hydroxide waste liquor
to regenerate sodium hydroxide. However, when the above
regeneration steps were repeated, carbon dioxide gas
present in the air was absorbed and accumulated in the
sodium hydroxide solution to form sodium carbonate, so
there was the problem that the etching ability of the
regenerated solution was lowered.Further, Japanese
