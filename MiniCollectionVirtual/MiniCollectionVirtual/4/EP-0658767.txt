<ABSTRACT>
An in-line sight indicator structure (60) for a 
fluid system wherein a chamber defining flow-through 

sight housing (61) includes a sight glass (73) in one wall portion 
thereof and a support member (74) extending from an opposite 

wall portion in spaced relation to the sight glass to 
support an indicator element (77) mounted thereon within a 

fluid stream passed through the chamber, the housing 
being hermetically sealed from ambient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sight gages 
and more particularly to an in-line sight indicator 
assembly for indicating the levels of dryness and 
excessive quantities of water in a refrigerant system 
and the presence of refrigerant. Various types of indicators have been used 
in the past wherein an indicating element responds by 
color change to the presence of water in a predetermined 
range within a refrigerant system, attention being 
directed for example to long since expired US-PS 
2,761,312 issued to Richard A. Line et al on September 
4, 1956 and No. 2,836,974, issued to Walter 0. Krause on 
June 3, 1958. In these patents, the color and the color 
intensity change in response to the relative saturation 
of water in a liquid above or below a predetermined 
range level with the color change being reversible in 
response to reverse relative saturations. In addition 
various in-line sight indicator housing assemblies have 
been utilized to house the color responding indicator 
elements. For the most part, these in-line sight 
indicator housing assemblies have supported the color 
responding indicator element at a position above the 
flow axis of the fluid stream to be examined with the 
indicator element being substantially against the sight 
glass. Moreover, the housing assembly structures of the 
past usually have included a number of parts, being 
comparatively complex and expensive in manufacture and 
assembly and being occasionally prone to fluid and/or 
gas leakage at the various junctures of the several 
parts of the assembly. In Fig. 3 of the drawings 
described herein below, one such assembly similar to 
that sold by AMI of ALCO Controls Division, Emerson 
Electric Co., St. Louis, Missouri includes an internally 
threaded housing having an in-line flow cavity 
internally threaded and recessed to receive an 
externally threaded sleeve having a sight glass disposed 
therein with a spring-like legged spider member support  
 
which, in turn, is supported by the leg extremities 
nesting in an internal groove in the sleeve. The spring-like 
legged spider member has an indicator element 
receiving cup mounted at the apex, the spider member 
serving to urge the indicator element toward the inner 
face of the sight glass. In Fig. 4 of the hereinbelow 
described drawing, a housing assembly structure similar 
to those sold by the Sporlan Company of St. Louis, 
Missouri and the Superior Valve Co. of Washington, Pa. 
is shown as including an externally threaded male 
carrier post threadably

An in-line sight indicator for a fluid 
system comprising an indicator housing having a chamber 

with spaced flow inlet and outlet passages communicating 
therewith, each of said passages being connected to a 

fluid conduit; 
   visually transparent sight means disposed in 

the wall of said housing; 
   an indicator element support member disposed 

and positioned in said housing chamber to support an 
indicator element in said housing chamber in spaced 

relation from said visually transparent sight means so 
as to be in-line with the flow of fluid stream flowing 

from said inlet to said spaced outlet passage; and 
   an indicator element mounted on said support 

member, said element being chemically responsive to a 
fluid in said fluid system to provide a visible color 

change in the event of a preselected range of change in 
the fluid in said system. 
The in-line sight indicator for the fluid 
system of claim 1, said several parts of said indicator 

being hermetically sealed from ambient. 
The in-line sight indicator for the fluid 
system of claim 2 said visually transparent sight means 

including hermetic means to form the same in said 
housing for hermetic sealing therewith. 
The in-line sight indicator for the fluid 
system of claim 1, said flow inlet and outlet passages 

in said housing chamber being axially aligned and 
oppositely spaced from each other.
