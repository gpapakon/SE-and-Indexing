<ABSTRACT>
A vessel and closure assembly for culturing cells wherein a gas
permeable membrane is provided in the closure to allow rapid and

uniform equilibration of gases between the atmosphere of the vessel and
the atmosphere of the incubator. A plug is provided for occluding

passage of gases through the gas permeable membrane when the vessel
is removed from the controlled atmosphere of the incubator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for cell culture production, and
more particularly to a vessel and closure assembly having means for
allowing or occluding the gas diffusion into and out of the vessel.Typically, cells are cultured under conditions in which the hydrogen
ion concentration (pH, the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion
concentration), temperature, humidity, osmolarity and concentration of
certain ions are controlled within relatively narrow limits.Vessels that are used in such tissue culture systems are typically
made from plastic and include closures. Such vessels and closures are
illustrated in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,289,248, 4,387,822, 4,770,308 and
5,047,347.In typical culture systems, pH is maintained near physiologic levels
by utilizing a buffering system in the tissue culture fluid, in conjunction
with an incubator in which carbon dioxide (CO2) is infused at a rate
sufficient to maintain a concentration in the incubator atmosphere of
approximately 5 to 7 volume percent. The CO2 reacts with water to form 
a weak acid and a carbonic acid, which in turn interacts with the
buffering system to maintain the pH near physiologic levels. Entry of
CO2 from the incubator into the tissue culture vessel is generally
achieved by utilizing a closure on the vessel such as, a loosely fitting cap,
a stopper or a cap with a permeable membrane (WO88/01605). Equilibrium in the
vessel is maintained by allowing gas exchange with the inside of the
vessel and the atmosphere of the incubator while preserving sterility and
preventing liquid leakage. A loosely fitting cap or a stopper is partially
opened either to an approximate extent determined by the user or by
the closure design.Removal of the vessel from the controlled atmosphere of the
incubator is often required during growth and culturing of cells. The
vessels are usually removed for inspection and/or treatment of the cells
and culture fluids. It is important that the pH of the cell culture be
maintained at the desired physiologic level while the vessel is outside of
the incubator.A special need exists for an improved closure assembly for a culture
vessel which (1) provides rapid and uniform equilibration between the
vessel atmosphere and the incubator; (2) allows the culture vessel to be
removed from the controlled atmosphere of the incubator for reasonably
long times without subjecting the cell culture to undesirable changes in
the pH of the system; and (3) is reusable.The present invention is a vessel comprising a chamber, an
opening, a closure or

<CLAIMS>
An assembly adapted for use in growing cell cultures in
incubators comprising:


a vessel comprising a chamber and a neck connected to said
chamber having an opening for introducing cells and culture fluids into

said chamber;
a closure for covering said opening in said neck comprising means
for removably mounting said closure to said neck, and means for allowing

gas diffusion into and out of said vessel; and
a plug removably attached to said closure for occluding gas
diffusion into and out of said vessel.
The assembly of Claim 1 wherein said means for removably
mounting said closure includes a threaded portion on said neck and a

mating threaded portion on said closure to provide screw type mounting
of said closure to said neck.
The assembly of Claim 1 wherein said vessel is a flask or a
roller bottle.
The assembly of Claim 1 wherein said closure is a cap or a
stopper.
The assembly of Claim 1 wherein said means for allowing gas
diffusion into and out of said vessel is a gas permeable membrane.
The assembly of Claim 4 wherein said cap (20) comprises a top
portion (36), a bottom portion (38), an annular skirt (40) extending from said top

portion to said bottom portion and having an inner surface (44) and outer
surface (42), an inner inverted skirt portion (46) surrounded by said inner surface

of said annular skirt and extending from said top portion toward said
bottom portion, an annular space (52) between said inner surface of said 

annular skirt and said inverted skirt portion, a compartment area (50) in said
top portion as defined by said inverted skirt portion and an orifice (54) in said

top portion as defined by said inverted skirt portion surrounded by said
compartment area, whereby said means for allowing gas diffusion (56) into

and out of said vessel is attached to said orifice.
The assembly of Claim 6 wherein said plug (22) comprises a
cylindrical base (24), a intermediate flange (26) and a hanger tab (28).
The assembly of Claim 7 wherein said cylindrical base (24) of said
plug (22) is removably secured to said compartment area (50) of said cap (20) whereby

gas diffusion into and out of said vessel is occluded.
The assembly of Claim 8 wherein said plug (22) is removed from
said compartment area (50) of said cap (20) by rotating said vessel and plug (22)

relative to one another in either direction and pulling said plug (22) axially out
of said compartment area (50).
