<ABSTRACT>
Items selected and set in a process up to the 
completion of the selection and setting operation 

achieved by the user for a plurality of items displayed 
in a screen image are memorized for each selection and 

setting operation. In an operation to be executed later 
by use of the items thus selected and set, there is 

displayed a screen image including the memorized 
selection items.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for adapting 
a user interface. This apparatus may be used in an information 
processing system in which a selection and setting 
operation is conducted by a user for a plurality of items 
displayed on a display screen. In the society today where information is 
quite valuable as a resource, operability is an issue to 
be emphasized in information processing systems for 
efficiency improvement of the user. The user processes a great amount of information 
through an information processing system such as a 
workstation and a personal computer in many cases. 
However, to complete processing of information of a 
certain type, there are required a series of operations 
such as a data input operation, dialog open and close 
operations, and selections of items (data items, work 
items, and/or processing procedure item names). These 
operations are conducted in most cases through routine 
jobs in which similar operations are repeatedly 
executed. For example, in a case where data beforehand 
created is displayed in the form of a graph, it is 
necessary to set attributes such as a type of graph  
 
(circle, bar, or broken-line graph); types of lines, 
colors, graticule, reference lines; a graph drawing 
area, and a title name for the graph. These 
setting operations are carried out for each graph and 
hence form a routine job in which similar operations 
are repeatedly effected for every 
graphs. In this situation, there arises a problem of 
how to efficiently adapt the interface to what the 
user wants in the information processing system of this kind. 
There have been heretofore provided various 
user interface configurations or systems. Known user interface 
systems are configured such that items beforehand 
prepared in the system are displayed on the display 
screen for the user to select only the necessary items 
therefrom so as to set the items. In this connection, a method of setting 
attributes of a graph in an operation to create a graph 
has been described in a manual "UIBT Operation (3050-7-404-10)". In this regard, from a viewpoint of each user, 
the selection and setting operation is rarely conducted 
for all items displayed on the display screen. Namely, 
in many cases, the selection and setting operation is 
required to be carried out only for a portion of the 
items.  
 For example, in order to display a plurality of 
pairs of data items in an identical graph format, when 
the color and the width of lines are not limited, but 
are allowed to be
