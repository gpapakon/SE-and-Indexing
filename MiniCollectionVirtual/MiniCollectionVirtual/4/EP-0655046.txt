<ABSTRACT>
A box-like cigarette pack includes a lid (20a) with a tab (60) that extends below the bottom of the lid. All or part of the tab may be made readily removable by providing a line of weakness between the removable tab (60) and the remainder of the lid. The tab may be printed or embossed with any desired information and may form a coupon or coupon-like article when removed. Until removed, the tab may be somewhat of an impediment to easy removal of cigarettes or reclosure of the pack, thereby prompting the consumer to remove the tab as intended.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cigarette packs,
and more particularly to cigarette packs in the form of
boxes.Cigarette packs in the form of boxes are
extremely well known. One of the most popular forms of
such boxes has an outer member which includes a lower
portion in which the cigarettes stand vertically. The
upper portion is a lid which is often (although not
always) hinged to the back of the lower portion so that
the upper ends of the cigarettes are exposed when the
lid is tipped back to open the box. Such boxes
typically have an innerframe inside the outer member
and which extends up from the lower portion under the
lid to provide some interference with the lid as it
opens and closes. This interference helps to keep the
lid firmly and neatly closed and reduces the risk that
the lid will open accidentally.Cigarette packs of the foregoing type are
relatively small and strong. The visible exterior
surfaces are needed for brand-identifying information,
contents specifications and warning labels. There is
therefore little or no space on the outside of the pack
for additional information such as promotional coupons,
and even if such additional information could be put on 
the outside of the pack, it would be difficult for the
consumer to remove that information (such as a coupon)
from the pack. Placing coupons or other information
separately in the pack is disadvantageous because such
placement necessitates additional processing steps,
additional production equipment and increased
production costs, and the consumer may not notice the
information.It is therefore an object of this invention
to provide a cigarette pack having additional surface
areas which can be used for a coupon or other
information.It is another object of this invention to
provide a cigarette pack including additional
information areas which cannot be overlooked by the
consumer, but which can be easily removed and either
saved or discarded as desired.It is a further object of this invention to
provide a cigarette pack having an additional but
removable information area, which pack functions as a
standard pack after the additional information area is
removed.These and other objects of the invention are
accomplished in accordance with the principles of the
invention by providing a paperboard box-like cigarette
pack in which the hinged lid (which may otherwise be
substantially conventional) has a tab that extends
below the normal front of the lid where the tab cannot
fail to be seen by the consumer when the lid of the
pack is first opened. All
