Equipment to form, on the basis of preformed blocks (17), a product suitable for 
modeling, having a pasty to solid consistency and which may tend to grow 

and/or crumble, compact blocks (17
a
) having dimensional stability characterized 
by the fact that it includes: 


at least one compacting chamber (5) closed on the sides, liable to be closed at 
the base by a retracting plate (8), and open on the face opposite to the base, with 

at least part of the side wall delimiting said compacting chamber (5) being 
mobile so that the transversal section of said chamber (5) is variable in size and 

if necessary, in its form, between a section (S) having dimensions and forms 
suitable for the acceptance of a preformed block (17) to be compacted in said 

compacting chamber (5) and a section (s), having a surface area smaller than 
that of section (S) and whose dimensions and shape correspond to those of the 

compacted block (17
a
) to be obtained; 
means (18) of feeding by the preformed blocks (17) to be compacted, the 
compacting chamber or each compacting chamber (5) through an opening 

opposite the base when the chamber is in the closed position; 
means (10) of varying the section of the compacting chamber or of each 
compacting chamber (5) when containing a block to be compacted (17) thus 

ensuring transversal compacting of the inserted block (17); 
means (14) of opening the base of the compacting chamber or of each 
compacting chamber (5) by the retraction of closing plate (8) while a same plate 

(8) may be common to several chambers (5); 
means (16) of ejecting from the compacting chamber or from each compacting 
chamber (5) the formed compacted blocks (17
a
); and 
means (19) for their unloading. 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that it includes means 
(16) of the axial compacting of a block (17) contained in a compacting chamber 

(5) according to the mean axial line of said block (17) whereas this compacting 
chamber (5) is in a position where it has a transversal section (s) which means 

(16) may also be actuated to eject the compacted block (17
a
), after both  
 

transverse and axial compacting, with the compacting chamber (5) base in the 
open position. 
Equipment according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that the axial 
compacting means (16) consists of a piston whose head (16
a
) has a section 
having the same shape and dimension as the section (s) and can be actuated to 

penetrate axially into the associated compacting chamber (5) through the 
opening opposite its base so as to compress the block (17) it contains, already 

compacted transversally. 
Equipment according to one of the claims 2 and 3, characterized in that the 
means of axial compacting (16) are suitable for controlling the height of the 

compacted blocks (17
a
). 
Equipment according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized by the fact that the 
compacting chamber or each compacting chamber (5) is delimited laterally by a 

fixed wall element (6) and a mobile wall element (7) consisting of a sheet of 
flexible material lined with non-stick material on the inside, said sheet being 

folded to bear against the two free edges (6
a
) of the fixed wall element (6) 
beyond which it extends in the form of two end strips (7
a
) liable to be alternately 
pulled and pushed so that the compacting chamber (5) changes from section (s) 

to section (S) with a fixed stop (12) arranged opposite the fixed wall element (7) said 
stop (12) being arranged to ensure that flexible leaf (7) which bears upon it when 

pushed by said end strips (7
a
) takes on a shape corresponding to section (S) of 
said chamber (5) and means (11) of guiding said flexible wall (7) being arranged 

in the bearing area of the wall against the edges (6
a
) of the fixed wall element (6). 
Equipment according to claim 5, characterized by the fact that the section (s) is a 
circular section, the fixed wall element (6) forming a fixed shell which is semi-cylindrical 

and a sheet (7) of flexible material being folded in order to present, as 
a transversal section, a horseshoe shape in the position where the compacting 

chamber (5) has a section (S). 
Equipment according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized by the fact that 
the compacting chamber or each compacting chamber (5) is laterally delimited 

by two opposed parallel strips (106
a
) closed on one side by a first fixed wall 
element (106), a second mobile wall element (107), which is liable to move by 

translation between the two parallel strips (106
a
), on the opposite side to the first 
fixed wall element (106).  

 
Equipment according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized by the fact that it 
includes means of preserving the compacted blocks (17
a
) in sealed bags (21) 
on their ejection out of compacting chamber (5). 
Equipment according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized by the fact the means 
of moving the mobile parts are mechanical, hydraulic and/or pneumatic control 

means. 
Equipment according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized by the fact that the 
product consists of mass molded composition, based on resin, cut glass fiber, 

powder-form mineral fillers and where applicable, the customary additives. 
Process of compacting preformed blocks of a modelable product, 
characterized in that it uses equipment according to one of claims 1 to 10.
