<ABSTRACT>
A testing apparatus (10) includes a receiver (28) for holding a plurality of textile samples (36) and an automatic feed mechanism (16) disposed adjacent to the receiver (28) for selectively engaging and removing samples (36) from the receiver (28) and transporting them to a processor (80) where the textile material (36) is processed to produce textile entities in an individualized condition. The entities are then transported to a sensor (82) that produces signals corresponding to characteristics of the entities. A control means (18) detects the presence or absence of a sample in the automatic feed mechanism (16) and controls it accordingly. Analog and digital components analyze the characteristic signals to identify segments of the characteristic signals that correspond to neps, trash and fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for measuring
characteristics of entities in a sample (36) of textile material
including fiber, neps and trash.The predecessor instrument to the present invention is
manufactured by Zellweger Uster, Inc. and is known as AFIS.
This instrument separated fibers and neps into one
airstream and trash into another airstream using the device
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,512,060, whose disclosure is
incorporated herein by reference. Trash is defined as
foreign matter having size greater than about 50 Âµm,
Sometimes this foreign matter is called dust and trash but
we shall use the designation trash here for simplicity. In
this predecessor, AFIS, it was necessary to test three sets
of replicate samples of textile material separately to
determine information about fibers, neps and trash. One
test and one separate sample of textile material was
necessary for each type of entity for each replicate.
Although this AFIS provided the best data available at the
time for automated and fast textile testing instruments,
there was a need for better data and increased speed. An
improved sensor was discovered and is disclosed in the U.S.
Patent 5,270,787 (=WO 91/14169), which represents the closest prior art and whose disclosure
is incorporated herein by reference, and the instrument
incorporating the improved sensor, also known as AFIS, is
manufactured by Zellweger Uster, Inc. For clarity and
consistency with the references, the first instrument is
called AFIS 0 and the instrument with the improved sensor
is called AFIS 1. The present invention is a further improvement in AFIS
1 and is directed primarily to testing rate considerations.
It was first discovered that the improved sensor of AFIS 1
produced data that would enable substantially simultaneous
measurement of multiple data from the same sample of
textile material. By substantially simultaneous it is
meant that nep data, fiber data and trash data are obtained
by testing a single sample of textile material and
detecting and measuring substantially all of the neps and
trash and detecting and measuring a representative sample
of the fibers. Thus, this improvement eliminates the need
to run three separate tests on typically three to five
replicates of three separate samples to obtain data for
neps, trash and fiber. Also, it was discovered that such
data could be obtained using only one sensor, if desired.
The testing speed improvements discussed above are made
possible by a new analyzer circuit, which is a hybrid
analog and
