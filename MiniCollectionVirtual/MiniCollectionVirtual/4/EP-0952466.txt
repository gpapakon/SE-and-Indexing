<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an active energy 
ray-curable composition and to a lens sheet, such as a 
prism sheet, used in liquid crystal display devices and 
the like, a lenticular lens sheet or Fresnel lens sheet 
used for projection television screens or a lenticular 
lens sheet used for stereoscopic photography and the 
like. Lens sheets, which include prism sheets used as 
backlight units for liquid crystal display devices and 
the like, Fresnel sheets and lenticular lens sheets used 
as projection screens for projection televisions and 
microfilm readers, and lenticular lens sheets used for 
stereoscopic photography and the like, have lens sections 
which are formed using active energy ray-curing 
compositions. Such lens sheets are constructed, for 
example, with a lens section made of a cured active 
energy ray-curable composition and formed on a 
transparent substrate. The active energy ray-curable 
composition used to form the lens section must have a 
variety of properties, including adhesion to the 
transparent substrate, releasability from the lens mold, 
and suitable optical characteristics. For example, in the case of backlights used for the 
color liquid crystal panels in color liquid crystal 
display devices for notebook computers, and in liquid 
crystal televisions and video-integrated liquid crystal 
televisions, it is important to reduce the power 
consumption to a minimum without lowering the brightness 
of the backlighting, and therefore greater optical 
efficiency has been desired for backlights. In this 
regard there has been proposed a backlight with enhanced 
brightness, wherein a prism sheet forming a prism row 2 
on one side as shown in Fig. 1(a) is mounted on the  
 
light-emitting surface 4 of the backlight 3 shown in Fig. 
1(b) in the manner shown in Fig. 1(c). The proposed prism sheet is usually one with a prism 
row formed by press working on one side of a transparent 
sheet made of a thermoplastic resin, or one with a prism 
row, made of an ultraviolet ray-curable composition, 
formed on one side of a transparent sheet, with the 
material for the former being polymethyl methacrylate 
(refractive index: 1.49) or polycarbonate (refractive 
index: 1.59) and the ultraviolet curing composition used 
for the latter being a (meth)acrylate-based composition 
(refractive index of cured resin: 1.49-1.55). However, with methods of fabricating prism sheets by 
the pressure formation method using thermoplastic resin 
transparent sheets, it is difficult to achieve a balance
