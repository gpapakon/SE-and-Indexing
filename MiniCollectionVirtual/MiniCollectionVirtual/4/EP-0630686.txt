<ABSTRACT>
Shredding device for garden refuse having a frame (4) which supports a drive motor and a feeding hopper (6) for the material to be shredded and surrounds a lower ejection chamber (5), a shredding casing (1) which is arranged on the said frame (4) between the feeding hopper (6) and the ejection chamber (5), and a shredding disk (9) which is to be mounted in the said casing (1) on an essentially vertical drive shaft (3), is to be driven by the latter in a rotary fashion and is equipped with shredding tools. In order to improve the shredding devices for garden refuse of the type mentioned above, which are generally termed choppers, in such a way that they are also and in particular suitable for shredding relatively moist compost and, to achieve this, are able to shred the compost and earth adhering thereto as finely as if it had been passed through a screen if possible, the shredding devices for garden refuse are designed in such a way that their shredding disk is composed of a tearing plate (9) provided, at the top, with tearing strips (7) which have essentially radial tearing teeth (7') and, at the bottom, with cleaning strips (8) which are also essentially radial, the structure of the tearing plate (9) being such that it does not have any through-slots at least in the region of its tearing strips (7).

Garden waste shedder comprising a stand (4) which carries
a drive motor and an input hopper (6) for the material

to be shredded and which also surrounds a lower ejector
chamber (5), a shredding housing (1) arranged on the

stand between input hopper (6) and ejector chamber (5),
as well as a shredding plate (9) arranged to be mounted

on a substantially vertical drive shaft (3) and to be
rotatably driven thereby, and equipped at the upper side

with substantially radially extending rib-like shredding
tools, the shredding plate being free from slots

therethrough at least in the region of its shredding
tools, and wherein substantially radially extending

clearing ribs (8) are provided on the underside of the
shredding plate to prevent blockages, 
characterised in
that
:

1.0 the garden waste shredder is designed as a
composting shredder, wherein
1.1 the shredding tools for the composting material are
shredding ribs (7) with upstanding shredding teeth

(7'), and that
1.2 the clearing ribs are provided with teeth which are
directed towards the bottom of the housing and

which extend close to the bottom of the housing.
Garden waste shredder according to claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 the shredding ribs (7) and also the clearing ribs
(8) which run closely over the bottom (1') of the 

shredding housing (1) consist of toothed ribs uniformly
distributed around the periphery of the shredding plate

(9).
Garden waste shredder according to claim 2, 
characterised
in that
 the toothed ribs (7, 8) are radially offset
relative to one another so that a surface-straddling

toothing is provided on the upper side of and on the
underside of the plate.
Garden waste shredder according to claim 2, 
characterised
in that
 the shredding ribs (7) are arranged on the
shredding plate (9) on the upper side thereof and

extending radially at an inclined angle so that their
inner ends (7'') are leading, seen in the direction of

rotation of the shredding plate (9), and with the radii
(11) extending respectively through these ends (7'')

forming an acute angle (α) with the ribs which is speed-dependent
and lies between 30° for lower speed rotation

of the shredding plate (9) at about 1000 rpm and 45° for
higher rotational speeds of about 3000 rpm.
Garden waste shredder according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the shredding plate (9) is arranged
sufficiently far below the lower end of the input hopper

(6) that the clearance space (a) for the material to be
shredded between the upper edges (7''') of the shredding

teeth (7') and the housing cover (1'') of the ejector
chamber (5) adjacent to the lower end of the input hopper

amounts to between 10 and 20 mm, wherein the smaller
clearance is chosen for lower speeds of rotation of the 

shredding plate (9) of about 1000 rpm and the greater
clearance is chosen for higher rotational speeds up to

3000 rpm and more.
Garden waste shredder according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 additional flat pre-shredding
blades (20) are mounted closely above the shredding plate

(9) on the drive shaft (3) which carries the latter, and
an abutment (18) cooperating with the rotating blade ends

is mounted on the shredding housing (1) above the outer
entry zone into the ejector chamber (5).
Garden waste shredder according to claim 6, 
characterised
in that
 the pre-shredding blades (20) consist of double
blades provided with cutters (20') lying in mirror-image

arrangement on the two sides, with the double blades
being arranged to be secured on the drive shaft (3) by

means of concentric screw fastening holes (22, 23).
Garden waste shredder according to claim 7, 
characterised
in that
 two identical double blades (20) are provided
arranged rotationally offset by 90° relative to one

another.
Garden waste shredder according to one of claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that
 a U-shaped protective angle member
(15) is mounted above the shredding plate (9) or the preshredding

blades (20) in their screw fastening region,
the angle member being secured to the drive shaft (3) by

the same fixing screws (12), wherein the upstanding limbs
(15') of the angle member are offset relative to one 

another and each lie in front of the heads (12') of the
fixing screws (12) seen in the direction of rotation of

the drive shaft (3).
