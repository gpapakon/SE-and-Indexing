<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable diaper used
for the absorption and containment of body excretions.Various proposals have already been made for disposable
diapers comprising a liquid-permeable topsheet, a liquid-impermeable
backsheet, an absorbent panel sandwiched between
these sheets, notches formed in opposite sides of a crotch
region destined to define leg-openings, stretchable elastic
means provided adjacent respective side edges of said
notches, and flaps provided on opposite sides of said
topsheet adapted to rise under the contraction of elastic
means in order to prevent body excretions from leaking in the
lateral direction.
Such a disposable diaper is disclosed in document GB-A-2 256
803.However, said flaps of well known art are provided along
their full length integrally with said topsheet so that these
flaps are stretched or contracted as the regions of the
diaper surrounding the wearer's legs are stretched or
contracted. In consequence, said flaps slacked as the leg-openings
of the diaper slacked, often resulting in leakage of
body excretions. Even if leakage of body excretions in the
lateral direction can be prevented by these flaps, a region 
of the diaper extending between these flaps spaced from each
other allows body excretions to spread over its relatively
large extent and feces would contaminate the wearer's skin at
least over this region.It is a principal object of the invention to solve such
a problem by attaching an auxiliary pad dimensioned to cover
said crotch zone, i.e., to cover anus and urinary organs of
the wearer on said topsheet so that the auxiliary pad is not
directly affected by the movement of said leg-openings.The object set forth above is achieved, according to the
invention, by a disposable diaper comprising a diaper having
a liquid-permeable topsheet, a liquid-impermeable backsheet,
an absorbent panel sandwiched between these sheets, notches
formed in opposite sides of a crotch zone of said diaper, said
notches being destined to define leg-openings of said diaper,
and stretchable means provided adjacent side edges of said
notches, said disposable diaper including an auxiliary pad
provided separately of said diaper dimensioned so as to cover
a crotch zone of the diaper and bonded to an upper surface of
said topsheet with opposite outer side regions of said
auxiliary pad being left free, said auxiliary pad being 
provided with longitudinally stretchable elastic members
extending substantially in parallel with and spaced inward
from said opposite outer side
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A disposable diaper (1) comprising a diaper having a
liquid-permeable topsheet (2), a liquid-impermeable backsheet (3),

an absorbent panel (4) sandwiched between these sheets, notches (5)
formed in opposite sides of a crotch zone of said diaper (1), said

notches (5) being destined to define leg-openings of said diaper (1),
and stretchable means (6) provided adjacent side edges of said

notches (5), said disposable diaper (1) including an auxiliary pad (10)
provided separately of said diaper dimensioned so as to cover

a crotch zone of said diaper and bonded to an upper surface of
said topsheet (2) with opposite side regions of said auxiliary

pad (10) being left free, said auxiliary pad (10) being provided with
longitudinally stretchable elastic members (14) extending

substantially in parallel with and spaced inward from said
opposite outer side regions

characterized in
that said auxiliary pad (10) may be

deformed to present an inverted Ω-shaped cross-section as
said elastic members contract.
A disposable diaper according to Claim 1, wherein
said auxiliary pad (10) comprises a liquid-permeable upper sheet (11),

a liquid-impermeable lower sheet (12) and a liquid absorbent panel (13)
sandwiched between these sheets.
