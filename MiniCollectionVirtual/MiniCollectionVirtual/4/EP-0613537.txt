<CLAIMS>
A sealing device between two interlocking concrete components, 
especially pipes, including the following features: 

each concrete component has a socket (1) with an inner surface 
(8) as well as a bottom surface (9) and a spigot end (1), respectively, 

which under intermediate connection of a seal (3) 
fit in each other;
 
the seal (3) being fixed in the socket (4) by means of anchorage 

means (4, 5) and having a solid elastomeric sealing region 
(6) and a resilient region (7, 12) which is adapted so as to 

resist loads of the kind appearing when moulding the concrete 
components but is compressible under the influence of pressures 

appearing when mounting and using the interlocking concrete 
components,
characterized
 in that the resilient region is 
constituted by a flap-shaped projection (7) which covers an 

annular space (11) towards the socket and lines the inner surface 
(8) of the socket at the transition to the bottom surface 

(9) of the socket as well as by a body (12) of light material 
positioned in the annular space (11). 
A sealing device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the flap-shaped projection (7) is provided 

with teeth (13) for keeping the body (12) of light material in 
place when the socket (1) is being moulded. 
A sealing device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the body of light material consists of 

foamed polystyrene plastic. 
A sealing device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the body (12) of light material consists 

of wound corrugated cardboard. 
A sealing device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 

characterized
 in that the body (12) of light material 
is substantially cylindrical.  

 
A sealing device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized
 in that the elastomeric sealing region 
(6) of the seal (3) has larger dimension in radial direction 

than the annular space (11). 
A sealing device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, 

characterized
 in that the elastomeric sealing 
region (6) of the seal (3) extends to the vicinity of the 

entering chamfer of the socket by means of a thinner, wedge-shaped 
continuation (18). 
A sealing device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, 

characterized
 in that the elastomeric sealing region 
(6) is provided with axially extending grooves (15, 16) 

which are open towards the annular space (11). 
A sealing device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, 

characterized
 in that the flap-shaped projection 
(7) has a T-shaped head (10).
