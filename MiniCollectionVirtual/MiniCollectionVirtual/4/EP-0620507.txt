<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to overcoatings for ionographic or
electrophotographic imaging and printing apparatuses or machines, and more particularly is
directed to an effective overcoating for a donor member, such as a donor roll, preferably with
electrodes closely spaced therein to form a toner cloud in the development zone to develop a
latent image. The present invention in embodiments is also directed to suitable charge
relaxable overcoatings, especially for the toner transport means in, for example, scavengeless
or hybrid scavengeless development systems, (see, for example US-A-s4,868,600, and
5,172,170).Overcoatings for donor rolls are known which contain a dispersion of conductive
particles like carbon black or graphite in a dielectric binder, such as a phenolic resin or
fluoropolymer, as disclosed in US-A-4,505,573. The desired resistivity is achieved by controlling
the loading of the conductive material. However, very small changes in the loading of
conductive materials near the percolation threshold cause dramatic changes in resistivity.
Furthermore, changes in the particle size and shape can cause wide variations in the resistivity
at constant weight loading. The desired volume electrical resistivity of the overcoating layer is
in the range of from about 107 ohm-cm to about 1013 ohm-cm. Preferably, the electrical
resistivity is in the range of 109 ohm-cm to about 1011 ohm-cm. If the resistivity is too low,
electrical breakdown of the coating can occur when a voltage is applied to an electrode or
material in contact with the overcoating, and resistive heating can cause the formation of holes
in the coating. When the resistivity is too high (âˆ¼1013 ohm-cm), charge accumulation on the
surface of the overcoating creates a voltage which changes the electrostatic forces acting on
the toner. The dielectric constant of the overcoatings used in the present invention ranges in
embodiments from about 3 to about 5, and is preferably about 3. The problem of the
sensitivity of the resistivity to the loading of conductive materials in an insulative dielectric
binder is avoided, or minimized with the coatings of the present invention.The techniques of electrophotographic printing and tri-level xerography are well
known.Trilevel, highlight color xerography is described in US-A-4,078,929 (Gundlach). This
patent discloses trilevel xerography as a means to achieve single-pass highlight color imaging
wherein a charge pattern is developed with toner particles of a first and second colors.The viability of
