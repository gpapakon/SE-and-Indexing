<ABSTRACT>
When transformed and quantized blocks of picture data are encoded, a block being constituted by a matrix of coefficients, the events within each block to be encoded comprise firstly a run indicating the number of zero-coefficients in the block between a current non-zero coefficient and the previous non-zero coefficient, and secondly, the size of the current non-zero coefficient of the block. Each event is in accordance with the invention completed by adding a third parameter which indicates whether the current non-zero coefficent is the last non-zero coefficent of the block. Hence, each event is represented as a three-dimensional quantity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for encoding 
picture data, and more specifically encoding of transformed 
and quantized blocks of picture data, optionally groups of 
such blocks, and said method is primarily of the type 
appearing from the preamble of the enclosed patent claim 1. Lately digital compression techniques have been put into 
use in order to reduce the bit consumption in the representation 
of single pictures or picture sequences (live 
pictures). These techniques are used e.g. in picture telephony. 
The picture telephony encoding technique itself is 
standardized in the international telecommunication organization 
CCITT. The standardizing work was conducted by an expert 
group under CCITT SG XV WP XV/1, and the resulting recommendation 
has the number J.261. Also within the international 
standardizing organization ISO work has been done to provide 
standards for encoding both live pictures and single pictures 
(still 1 pictures). The groups responsible for these activities 
have designations ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG11 (for live pictures) 
and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG10 (for still pictures). The methods 
which are usually called MTEG and JPEG, are described in 
respectively ISO/IEC JTC1 Committee Draft 10918 and ISO/IEC 
JTC1 Committee Draft 11172. A common feature for all these techiques is that blocks 
of picture values are processed. By applying a suitable 
transformation to the block, the result will be a block in the 
transform plane where the energy content is concentrated 
toward a block corner. Usually a discrete cosine transform 
(DCT) is used. All the three above mentioned method use DCT. 
The transformed blocks are quantized, and the quantized values 
are thereafter encoded with a so-called "variable length 
code". See also EP-A-0 453 113 which discloses similar techniques. While the quantization introduces errors in the reconstructed 
signal (i.e. is irreversible), the variable length 
type encoding is a reversible process. This means that it is 
possible to reconstruct excactly that which has been encoded  
 
with a variable length code. The purpose of using encoding of 
the variable length type, is to reduce the data amount transmitted, 
without changing the information content. Events of 
small probability are encoded with many bits, while events of 
great probability are encoded using few bits. The so-called 
"Huffman encoding" is an example of encoding of the variable 
length type. It is a condition for improvement when the 
variable length coding is used, that different

<CLAIMS>
A method for encoding transformed and quantized blocks of 
picture data, optionally groups of such blocks, where a block 

is constituted by a matrix of coefficients, and the energy 
content of a block is increasing toward a block corner, the 

events within each block or group of blocks to be encoded, 
comprising 


(a) a run indicating the number of zero-coefficients in 
the block/group between a current non-zero coefficient and the 

previous non-zero coefficient, the run direction in said 
block/group being predetermined, and 
(b) the size of said current non-zero coefficient in 
said group/block, 
 
   each event being entered in a series of successive events 

and the respective event thereafter being re-encoded to a 
variable length code by using a look-up table,
characterized
 in that each event is completed 
by adding
 
   (c) a third parameter stating whether said current non-zero 

coefficient is the last non-zero coefficient of the 
block, said third parameter having only two possible values, 

each event thereby being represented as a three-dimensional 
quantity. 
The method of claim 1, wherein a block is to be encoded,
characterized
 in that the run direction within 
said block follows the CCITT standard algorithm for block 

coeffecient encoding. 
The method of claim 1, wherein a group of blocks is to be 
encoded,
characterized
 in that said group is arranged as 
a matrix of all coefficients in each block up to the last non-zero 

coefficient in the block, in a column, with juxtaposed 
columns block by block.  

 
The method of claim 3,
characterized
 in that the run direction within 
said group matrix is simple row by row, positions in said 

group matrix without any coefficient not being taken into consideration 
when calculating the run value.
