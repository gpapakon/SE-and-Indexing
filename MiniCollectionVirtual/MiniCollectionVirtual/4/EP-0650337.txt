<ABSTRACT>
Described is a holder (44) for a toothbrush (20), in particular a toothbrush for cleaning interdental spaces, the holder being designed to hold the brush, which consists preferably of an in particular handle-shaped brush body (38) with bristles (45) fixed in it, detachably in place. The brush body (38) has a section without bristles and the brush holder (44) has holding means (57) into which the section without bristles can be inserted. The toothbrush holder (44) is approximately disc-shaped. Associated with the holding means (57) is a recess (60) in which a clip element (65) is mounted so that it can pivot, thus enabling the brush (24) to be detachably clipped in the brush holder (44).

A brush holder (44) for a toothbrush, in particular 
for cleaning the interproximal spaces, for releasably 

locating a brush (41) preferably comprising an 
in particular stem-shaped bristle supporting structure 

(38) having bristles (45) secured thereto, the bristle 
supporting structure (38) including a portion (52) carrying 

no bristles and the brush holder (44) including a 
receiving means (57) adapted to receive the bare portion 

(52), 
characterized in that
 the brush holder (44) is of 
an approximately disk-shaped configuration, that the receiving 

means (57) is associated with a recess (60), and 
that the recess (60) carries pivotally therein a clamping 

means (65) for clampingly, yet releasably, positioning 
the brush (41) in its proper location relative to the 

brush holder (44). 
A brush holder as claimed in claim 1, 

characterized in that
 the clamping means (65) has a pivot 
axis (64) extending parallel to a center line (62) of the 

receiving means (57). 
A brush holder as claimed in claim 1 or claim 
2, 
characterized in that
 the recess (60) terminates in a 
section of the receiving means (57), and that the receiving 

means (57) includes an enlarged portion (63) adjacent 
to said section. 
A brush holder as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the receiving means 
(57) is configured as a bore (58). 
A brush holder as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the bore (58) is 
provided with a diameter slightly larger than that of the 

stem-shaped bristle supporting structure (38). 
A brush holder as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the brush holder 
(44) includes an upper end (69) having a frusto-conical 

projecting portion (70), with the bore (58) being 
arranged in the center thereof. 
A brush holder as claimed in claim 6, 

characterized in that
 the bore (58) includes an entrance 
opening (59) having a countersunk portion (72).  

 
A brush holder as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the pivot axis (64) 
of the clamping means (65) is disposed in a laterally 

offset relation to a longitudinal center plane of the 
brush holder (44). 
A brush holder as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the clamping means 
(65) is substantially configured as a hook-shaped clamping 

lever (66) having at one end of the hook a nose-shaped 
section (67). 
A brush holder as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the brush holder 
(44) is adapted to be driven in a rotating or oscillating 

fashion and includes an axis of rotation (56) substantially 
coinciding with the center line (62) of the receiving 

means (57). 
A brush holder as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that
 the brush holder 
(44) is configured so as to be essentially symmetrical 

about the axis. 
A brush holder as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that
 the recess (60) and 
the clamping means (65) have essentially conforming 

length and width dimensions. 
A brush holder as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that
 a recess (76) is 
provided between a hook end of the clamping lever (66) 

and the brush holder (44).
