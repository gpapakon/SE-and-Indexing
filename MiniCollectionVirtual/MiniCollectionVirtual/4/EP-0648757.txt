<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel isothiazolone derivative and a 
microbicidal composition comprising the isothiazolone derivative as an active ingredient. 
The present invention also relates to an intermediate compound for use in the production 
of the isothiazolone derivative. There are disclosed some isothiazolone derivatives in the U.S. Patent Nos. 
3,761,488 and 4,127,687. These isothiazolone derivatives do not have satisfactory 
effects of preventing or inhibiting the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria and 
fungi. It is the object of the present invention to 
provide novel isothiazolone derivatives and a microbicide, 
which can prevent various troubles caused by microorganisms. 
This object is achieved on the basis of the finding that 
particular isothiazolone derivatives have excellent effects 
of destroying or inhibiting microorganisms. Thus the present invention provides an isothiazolone derivative of the 
formula: 
wherein X¹ and X² are the same or different and are independently hydrogen, chlorine or 
bromine; and R is haloalkoxy. The present invention also provides a microbicidal 
composition comprising the isothiazolone derivative (I) as an active ingredient and an 
intermediate compound for use in the production of the isothiazolone derivative (I).  In the isothiazolone derivative (I), the substituent R is haloalkoxy, usually 
C₁-C₈ haloalkoxy, and preferably C₁-C₄ haloalkoxy. Typical examples of the haloalkoxy 
are fluoroalkoxy such as difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, chlorodifluoromethoxy, 
pentafluoroethoxy and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy. The isothiazolone derivative (I) of the present invention has excellent 
microbicidal activity against various microorganisms including the following bacteria and 
fungi. Genera of Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Flavobacterium, Klebsiella, 
Micrococcus, Proteus Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Desulphovibrio, 
Enterobacter, Achrcmobacter, Cellulomonas, Paracolabactrum, Sphaerotilus, Sporocytophaga, 
Gallionella, Leptothrix, Beggiatoa and Aerobacter. Genera of Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, Aureobasidium, 
Tyromyces, Coriolus, Myrothecium, Fusarium, Rhizopus, Mucor, Epicoccum, 
Trichoderma, Phoma, Geotrichum and Monilia. The isothiazolone derivative of the formula (I) wherein X¹ is hydrogen can 
be prepared by reacting a disulfide of the formula (II): 
wherein R is as defined above, with a halogenating agent. The isothiazolone derivative of 
the formula (I) wherein X¹ is chlorine or bromine can be prepared by
