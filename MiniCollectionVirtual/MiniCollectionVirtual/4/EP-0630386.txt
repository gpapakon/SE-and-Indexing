<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to acrylic 
polymers which are formed by emulsion polymerization 
and as formed, are inherently tacky and functional as 
pressure-sensitive adhesives. More particularly, the 
adhesives of the instant invention have excellent 
guillotinability, room- and elevated-temperature 
adhesive performance and provide an ecologically safe 
replacement for solvent adhesives and other acrylic- 
and rubber-based emulsion adhesives. Guillotinability is a critical requirement in 
film applications where pressure-sensitive adhesive 
(PSA) coated products are cut into sheet stock. During 
the process of guillotining it is expected that the 
adhesive will not build on the blades so that 
subsequent cutting is not affected and the cut sheets 
separate individually without sticking together. 
Solvent adhesives are commonly used in such 
applications due to the performance benefits they 
offer. Environmental constraints imposed on the use of 
solvents has caused the PSA industry to move away from 
solvent systems. The best alternative to date is the 
water borne adhesive technology due to adhesive user 
friendliness and the cost advantages. Obtaining high  
 
performance from water borne adhesive systems is the major 
task which the PSA industry is facing. In terms of the instant invention U.S. Patents Nos 
4,507,429, 4,694,056 and 4,725,639 to Lenney, and assigned 
to Air Products, Inc., pertain to pressure-sensitive 
adhesive compositions and disclose increasing cohesive 
strength by use of polyfunctional monomers which include 
polyvinyl and polyallyl compounds including triallyl 
isocyanurate. Product glass transition temperature may be 
as high as -15°C, limiting utility at reduced temperature. We have sought to provide pressure-sensitive adhesives 
of improved properties which have broad utility including 
excellent guillotinability. EP-A-0144723 discloses a process for preparing a 
pressure sensitive adhesive by emulsion polymerization of 
an alkyl acrylate or vinyl ester, an olefinically 
unsaturated carboxylic acid and a polyolefinically 
unsaturated monomer which enhances the cohesive strength of 
the ensuing polymer. The adhesive allegedly has good quick 
tack and peel strength properties. There is no teaching of 
a need to increase guillotinability or the use of defined 
quantities of a multifunctional monomer for this purpose.  
 The invention is defined in claim 1 hereafter and 
other features are defined in the sub-claims appended 
thereto. According to the present invention,
