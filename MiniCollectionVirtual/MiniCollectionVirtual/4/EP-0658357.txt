<ABSTRACT>
A connector 1 has an instrument insertion passage 21 
which is provided with a seal member 5 made from an elastic 

member formed with a seal member passage 51 having a 
narrowed portion 52. When a knob 61 is grasped and turned 

clockwise to turn a control body 6, the control body 6 is 
forced into the connector 1 and abuts the seal member 5 

causing the seal member 5 to deform so as to reduce the 
inner diameter of the seal member 5, thereby enabling an 

instrument 15 to be held by the narrowed portion 52 in a 
fluid-tight manner which allows the instrument 15 to be 

slidable through the connector 1. Also, by turning the 
control body 6 further into the connector 1, the deformation 

of the seal member 5 can be increased to cause the narrowed 
portion 52 to fix the instrument 15 in place in a manner 

that prevents the instrument 15 from being slid through the 
connector 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector for
slidably holding an instrument which is used by being
inserted into a tube-shaped body in fluid-tight seal
condition with the inside of the tube-shaped body, and in
particular relates to a connector which is to be connected
to a base end portion of a tube-shaped body such as a guide
catheter to be inserted into a body, for slidably holding an
instrument such as a balloon catheter or a guide wire to be
inserted into the tube-shaped body in fluid-tight seal
condition with the inside of the tube-shaped body.Up to now, when carrying out medical treatments on
stenosis portion of blood vessels caused by arteriosclerosis
or the like, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty
(PTCA) is adopted as the typical method of angioplasty. The
PTCA is comprised of the steps of inserting a catheter
equipped with a dilator such as a balloon at its tip into
the stenosis portion of the blood vessel and inflating the
dilator so as to dilate the stenosis portion of the blood
vessel, thereby improving blood flow at the distal side
thereof. During such surgical procedure, before the
catheter equipped with the dilator is inserted into the
blood vessel, a guide catheter which is used for guiding the
dilator-equipped catheter toward the position of the
stenosis portion is inserted and then held in place within
the blood vessel. At such time, a Y-shaped connector is
usually used, which is connected to the base end of the
guide catheter before insertion of the dilator-equipped
catheter.As disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility Model 
Publications No. 53-44870 and 4-8918, the known Y-shaped
connector is composed of a connector body having an
insertion passage extending in an axial direction thereof, a
seal member formed of an elastic cylindrical body (O-ring)
and a control body which is fitted or screwed to the
connector body and which is used to change the inner
diameter of the seal member by changing the shape of the
seal member from the outside of the connector body. Thus,
by screwing the control body into the connector body, the
resulting pressure causes the seal member to change its
shape, and this enables to hold the dilator-equipped
catheter passing through the seal member under fluid-tight
condition with the inside of the guide catheter.However, the seal members of these kinds of prior
art connectors have a simple cylindrical shape with a
predetermined fixed inner diameter that is larger than the
outer diameter of the dilator-equipped catheter. Therefore,
if the

comprising:


a connector body (2) having a tip portion which is adapted to
be connected to or integrally formed with an end portion of a tube-shaped

body, an end portion from which an instrument (15) which is
used by being inserted into the tube-shaped body is to be inserted, and

an insertion passage (21) which extends in an axial direction of the
connector body (2) so that said tip portion of said connector body (2)

communicates with said end portion thereof;
a seal member (5) for slidably and fixedly holding said
instrument when inserted in a fluid-tight seal condition with an inside

of said tube-shaped body, said seal member (5) being formed from a
substantially cylindrical elastic member disposed within said insertion

passage (21) of said connector body (2) under a condition such that
radially outward deformation thereof is restricted, said seal member

(5) being formed with a seal member passage (51) which is defined by
an inner cylindrical surface of said seal member (5), the seal member

passage (51) having an axis that is aligned with an axis of said
insertion passage (21), and the inner diameter of the seal member

passage (51) being reduced to form a contact portion on a part of said
inner surface, said contact portion of said seal member (5) being

formed into a narrowed portion (52) having the narrowest inner
diameter and said contact portion being arranged such that it is in

close vicinity of said instrument when inserted so as to provide seal condition by
being in contact with said instrument (15) when said seal member (5)

is deformed by being compressed; and
adjustment means (6) having a pushing portion (63) for
compressing said seal member to deform it, thereby providing the

fluid-tight seal condition;
said narrowed portion (52) of said seal member (5) being
adapted to be deformed in such a way that a large amount of

deformation toward the central axis of the seal member is obtained 
resulting in a larger contact area between the narrowed portion (52)

and the instrument (15) when inserted as more compressive force is applied

 the seal member (5) and the adjustment means (6) are designed so
that at the state when no instrument (15) is inserted through the seal

member (5), the narrowed portion (52) shuts off the passage (51)
