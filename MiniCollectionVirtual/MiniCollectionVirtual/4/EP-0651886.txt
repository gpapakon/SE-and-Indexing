<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, means are provided for joining metal wire segments into one or more serpentine structures during the testing phase so that a signal applied at one end will be detected at the other end if the metal segments are continuous. Metal segments connected into one serpentine chain can be simultaneouly tested for continuity from a single origin and destination. Preferably two serpentine chains are provided, physically interdigitated with each other so that electrical shorts between adjacent wire segments will cause a signal applied to one serpentine chain to be detected on the other serpentine chain.

<DESCRIPTION>
 STRUCTURE AND METHOD FOR TESTING WIRING SEGMENTS IN AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DEVICEFIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to integrated circuit devices and to a method for testing the devices during manufacturing. More particularly the invention relates to testing of wiring segments in a programmable integrated circuit device.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION When an integrated circuit device is being manufactured, it is necessary to test components of the device, preferably all components, for proper operation. For example all transistors must be tested. All antifuses must be tested for non-conductivity in their original state (antifuses can not be tested in their programmed state because the programming is one-time-only and must be left to the user) . All metal lines must also be tested, both for continuity throughout their length and for shorts to adjacent metal lines. A simple means for applying test vectors to the metal lines is preferred in order to facilitate testing.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, means are provided for joining metal wire segments into one or more serpentine structures during the testing phase so that a signal applied at one end will be detected at the other end if the metal segments are continuous. Metal segments connected into one serpentine chain can be simultaneously tested for continuity from a single origin and destination. Preferably two serpentine chains are provided, physically interdigitated with each other so that electrical shorts between adjacent wire segments will cause a signal applied to one serpentine chain to be detected on the other serpentine chain. 

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 shows a first embodiment of the invention. Fig. 2 shows a second embodiment of the invention. Fig. 3 shows a third embodiment of the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Fig. 1 shows a plurality of wiring segments LI, L2, and L3, representative of wiring segments in a programmable logic device. During operation of the device, these wiring segments are available for connecting other structures not shown in Fig. 1 to each other or to other wiring segments. According to the invention, transistors such as Tl, T2, and T3 are formed so that when turned on they join the wiring segments into a continuous chain. A test signal TEST is applied to the gates of transistors Tl, T2, and T3 causing the transistors to turn on for interconnecting the wiring segments LI, L2, and L3. A signal applied at A will be detected at AX if the wiring segments
