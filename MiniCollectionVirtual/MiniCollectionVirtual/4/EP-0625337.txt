<ABSTRACT>
The spinal fixator comprises two substantially parallel assemblies which each consist:   - of a sliding element (3) which has a U-shape and whose bottom is pierced with an emergent slot (3a); - of a plurality of rings (4) which are each pierced with a horizontal opening (4a) having a profile corresponding to that of the sliding element, a tapped bore (4c) coaxial with a smooth hole (4b) made in the bottom of the said ring (4) perpendicularly to the opening (4a); - of pedicle screws (5) with self-tapping screw thread (5a) and with spherical head (5d); - and of threaded caps (6) screwed into the tapped bore (4c) of each ring (4) and each bearing on the upper part of the spherical head (5b) of the pedicle screws (5) so as to assemble the ring (4) and the sliding element (3) by tightening using the spherical head (5b) of the screw (5).

Spinal fixator consisting of two substantially 
parallel assemblies for aligning and holding a vertebral 

column, each comprising a slide rail, pedicle screws with 
self-tapping thread and spherical head, and threaded 

caps, characterized in that each of the assemblies 
consists of: 


a slide rail (3) which has a U shape, the 
bottom of which is punched with an open slot (3
a
); 
several rings (4) which are each punched with 
a horizontal through-opening (4
a
) having an internal 
profile corresponding to that of the slide rail, a tapped 

bore (4
c
) coaxial to a smooth hole (4
b
) formed in the 
bottom of the said ring perpendicular to the opening 

(4
a
); 
pedicle screws (5) with self-tapping thread 
(5
a
) and spherical head (5
b
); 
and threaded caps (6) screwed into the tapped 
bore (4
c
) of each ring (4) and which each bear on the 
upper part of the spherical head (5
b
) of the pedicle 
screw (5) in such a way as to assemble, by clamping, the 

ring (4) and the slide rail (3) by way of the spherical 
head (5
b
) of the said screw (5). 
Fixator according to Claim 1, characterized in 

that the ring (4) is equipped with an open hole (4
d
) 
which is provided above the opening (4
a
), but 
perpendicular thereto. 
Fixator according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the hole (4
d
) of a first complementary ring (4) is 
designed to receive one of the free ends of a rod (4
e
)  
 

which is immobilized, by clamping, between a tapped cap 
(4
f
) and the slide rail (3), while the other end of the 
rod (4
e
) is fixed in the same way, but in a second 
complementary ring (4). 
Fixator according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises a ring (8) equipped with a horizontal 

through-opening (8
a
) of U shape, a hole (8
b
) punched in 
the bottom of the said ring, a tapped bore (8
c
) coaxial 
to the said hole (8
b
), and a horizontal plate (8
d
) which 
is provided level with the bottom of the said ring (8) 

and in the continuation of the opening (8
a
). 
Fixator according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the plate (8
d
) is punched with an oblong slot (8
e
) 
and includes, on its outer periphery, teeth (8
f
) which 
cooperate upon assembly with two opposite lugs (8
h
) 
integral with a washer (8
g
). 
Fixator according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the tapped cap (6) includes, in its lower part, a 

bearing surface (6
c
) in the form of a sphere portion with 
the same radius as the spherical head (5
b
) of the pedicle 
screw (5). 
Fixator according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the washer (8
g
) is punched with a central hole (8
i
) 
which includes an outer chamfer (8
j
) of concave profile 
with the same radius as that of the spherical head (5
b
) 
of the screw (5). 
Fixator according to Claims 1, 2 and 4, 
characterized in that the rings (4, 8) have an outer 

profile which is square in their upper part and rounded 
in their lower part.
