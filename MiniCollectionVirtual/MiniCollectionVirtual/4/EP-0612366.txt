<ABSTRACT>
A handle mounting assembly for a vent or casement window, the assembly comprising a first mounting member (12) secured at one end of a lever handle (13), and a second mounting member (11) fixed to the window frame (10), the first member (12) being engageable with the second member (11) to mount the handle (13) on the frame (10). The two mounting members (11, 12) have cooperating parts (27, 29) with abutting surfaces which interlock with one another when the first member (12) moves into engagement with the second member (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
 HANDLE MOUNTING ASSEMBLIESThis invention relates to a handle mounting assembly for a vent or casement window.When transporting pre-assembl ed uPVC profile window frames from a manufacturer to the point of installation, the frames are preferably stacked side-by-side or one on top of the other. A problem which then arises is that projecting parts of the frame, such as closure handles, may cause damage or may themselves be damaged during transit. One way to overcome this problem is to fit the handle on site.. At present, this would involve the site personnel carrying the necessary fastening components, and would further add to the time and cost of installation. Moreover, the fastenings would be visible after fitting the handle, and some means would be required for temporarily holding vent or casement windows shut during transit.Accordingly, there is a need for a handle which can be easily fitted to a window after installation without the need for additional fastening components and without any such components being visible.In GB-A-1439606 there is disclosed a handle mounting assembly in which a mounting plate pivotally secured to a handle is detachably secured to a fixing plate secured to the window frame. In this arrangement, the mounting plate slidably engages the fixing plate, and the two plates are 

 held together by a wedging action and by a screw which remains visible after the fixing has been completed. The handle can be removed by withdrawing the screw and pulling the two plates apart. In addition, no means are provided for temporarily securing the window during transit.According to the present invention there is provided a handle mounting assembly for a vent or casement window, the assembly comprising a first mounting member secured at one end of a lever handle, and a second mounting member secured to the window frame, the f rst member being engageable with the second member to mount the handle on the frame, characterised in that the two mounting members have cooperating parts which interlock with one another when the first member moves into engagement with the second member, the interlock being such that the two members cannot be separated.In a preferred embodiment the first mounting member, when engaged with the second mounting member, conceals the fixing of the second member to the window frame. Preferably, the first member is slidably engageable with the second member, and the interlock includes a resilient catch mechanism preventing return sliding movement in the opposite direction.In one

CLAIMS
1. A handle mounting assembly for a vent or casement window, the assembly comprising a first mounting member
(12) secured at one end of a lever handle (13), and a second mounting member (11) fixed to the window frame (10), the first member being engageable with the second member to mount the handle on the frame, characterised in that the two mounting members have cooperating parts (27, 29) with abutting surfaces which interlock with one another when the first member (12) moves into engagement with the second member (11).
2. An assembly according to claim 1 in which the first member (12), when engaged with the second member (11), conceals the fixing of the second member (11) to the window frame (10).
3. An assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the first member (12) is slidably engageable with the second member (11) and the interlock includes a resilient catch mechanism (27, 29) preventing return sliding movement in the opposite direction.
4. An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3 further comprising a wedge stop (14) for attachment to a fixed window frame (20) bounding the vent or casement window (10), the wedge stop being temporarily connected to the 


second mounting member by a severable link (17) to hold the window (10) closed prior to mounting the handle (13) and being adapted to progressively engage a projection (37) of the handle to secure the window after severing the link and mounting the handle.
5. An assembly according to claim 4 in which the joining link (17) and wedge stop (14) are formed of a plastics material and moulded in one piece with an insert (16) adapted to fit in the second mounting member (11).
