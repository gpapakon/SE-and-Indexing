<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to our following patent 
applications: 
The present invention relates to analog-to-digital ("A/D") 
converters and, more particularly, to successive approximation type 
A/D converters. Generally, a successive approximation type A/D converter 
includes means for sampling an analog voltage input, means for 
supplying a successive approximaion control digital output, means for 
comparing analog voltages, and means for successive determining 
values of bits of an A/D conversion output. In operation, a typical 
successive approximation type A/D converter samples an analog voltage 
input, supplies a successive approximation control digital output 
from a successive approximation type control circuit to a local 
digital-to-analog ("D/A") converter to cause the D/A converter to 
generate a local analog voltage, compares the sampled and held analog 
voltage with the local analog voltage, and  
 
successively determines the value of each bit of an A/D 
conversion output on the basis of the relationship in 
magnitude between the compared voltages. By doing the 
foregoing, a successive approximation type A/D converter 
obtains an A/D conversion output having a plurality of 
bits from the successive approximation type control 
circuit. A more detailed description of an algorithmic A/D 
converter is set forth in the background section of U.S. 
Patent 5,017,920 to French. The converter described 
therein includes a signal input line or system input 
terminal which receives an analog signal. The analog 
input signal is sampled in sample and hold circuitry. A 
switch connects the output terminal of the sample and 
hold circuit to an input terminal of a comparator and to 
the positive input terminal of a subtractor. In the example presented in U.S. Patent 5,017,920, 
the input analog signal is assumed to have a maximum 
value of Vm. The comparator compares the input signal 
sample with a threshold voltage Vm/2. If the signal 
exceeds the threshold voltage, the comparator outputs a 
one (1). A switch control connected to the output of the 
comparator controls the value of voltage applied to the 
negative input terminal of the subtractor. The 
subtractor removes a voltage or value corresponding to 
the threshold exceeded from the input analog signal. French's switch control applies the appropriate 
voltage to the negative input terminal of the subtractor. 
If the comparator outputs a one (1), indicating that the 
threshold Vm/2 has been exceeded, the switch control 
applies the voltage Vm/2 to
