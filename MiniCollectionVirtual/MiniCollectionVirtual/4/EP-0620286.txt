<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metallic
member, especially, aluminum, ferrous and copper alloys,
having one or more of high electric conductivity, high
thermal conductivity, heat resistance and wear
resistance, in which super fine ceramic particles and
solid lubricant particles or solid lubricant short size
fibers, especially, graphite whiskers, are dispersed,
and is more particularly concerned with a nitride
dispersion strengthening copper alloy, a nitride
dispersed aluminum alloy and a nitride dispersion
strengthened iron which are suitable for use in electro-conductive,
heat-resistant strengthened members such as
sliding contact members and electric contacts, a
manufacturing method thereof, and use thereof.For the purpose of utilizing advantageous
basic characteristics of copper, i.e., high electric
conductivity and high thermal conductivity, in various
industrial products, many copper alloys improved to
overcome a weak point of copper, i.e., a deficiency in
strength, have been manufactured. As methods for
strengthening copper, known hitherto are a method of
adding one or more of elements having less solubility 
into matrix, such as Zr, Cr, Cd and Be, to develop
precipitation hardening by aging treatment, and a method
of dispersing ceramic particles, which are hard to react
with a copper matrix phase, into the matrix phase. The
strengthening is effected by precipitates or ceramic
particles which are finely dispersed in the mother phase
and prevent dislocation movement responsible for a
plastic deformation. The former strengthening method is
disclosed in JP-A-57-9850. Of the latter strengthening
method, oxide-dispersion-hardening is disclosed in JP-A-2-213433,
carbide-dispersion-hardening in JP-A-1-96338,
and nitride-dispersion-hardening in JP-A-60-208402.Meanwhile, addition of graphite powder or BN
powder improves lubrication property, low contact
resistance and seizure resistance of copper alloys. A
method for manufacturing such copper alloys is disclosed
in, for example, JP-A-57-123943. Addition of graphite
powder is practiced to manufacture copper alloys for
electric contacts, aiming at an improvement in low
contact resistance and seizure resistance, and is
disclosed in JP-A-62-284031.The aforesaid precipitation-hardening copper
alloy can keep the strength at temperatures of about
400°C or below, but loses its hardening ability at
temperatures higher than 400°C due to pyrolysis of
precipitates.On the other hand, as dispersing methods used
to manufacture a ceramic dispersion strengthening
