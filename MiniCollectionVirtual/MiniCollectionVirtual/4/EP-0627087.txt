<ABSTRACT>
A towed streamer including a hydrophone (1) supported, in a filler (4) being either liquid or semi-liquid such as a gel having wave damping properties, within a housing (2). The housing (2) is in the form of a tube whose ends are closed by closures such as rigid plugs (3). Where liquid is used wave damping baffles such as open cell foam structures are provided. A rigid shielding arrangement in the form of reinforcing strips (5) can be provided to shield the hydrophone from bulge waves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hydrophone arrangement within a towed
streamer cable of the type having an outer sheath and strain members
positioned within the cable so as to transmit tension along the cable,
said arrangement including at least one hydrophone enclosed within a
tubular housing, the housing being filled with a filler adapted for
damping acoustic waves and being closed off at each end by a rigid
closure, the hydrophone being supported apart from said housing and
said rigid closures.An arrangement of this type is disclosed in AU-B-87641/82.Towed streamers often comprise several sections, each having its own
function and characteristics. The active section of the streamer
contains most acoustic sensors which sensors are placed in fixed
relationship to each other behind the towing vessel at an appropriate
depth. For the sensor to be effective in detecting acoustic waves,
generated in the water from sources of interest, it is desirable to
ensure that the hydrophone is as free from extraneous noise generated
by the environment and the towing system as is possible.Typical noise sources comprise sea noise generated by wave action and
marine animals, noise produced by water flow over all elements of the
towed array and vibration induced excitation from the towing vessel
and cross flow over the tow cable sections which are towed at an angle
to the direction of tow.There is associated with each noise source a spectrum of waves which
can be characterised by wave speed and frequencies commonly referred
to as wavenumber spectrum. The wave excitation originating at sources
excite waves in the towed streamer structure of the active section
containing the sensors and indeed the waves can he generated within
the sensor itself, such waves will be referred to as structural waves.The region of interest for acoustic targets exists over only a small 
region of the wavenumber spectrum and is characterized by a single
wave speed whereas the noise tends to be from a wider region. Should
any of the structural waves existing in the towed streamer be within
the acoustic wavenumber window of interest then any genuine acoustic
target coinciding with the structural waves will be masked by the
presence of such structural waves.There are two methods of eliminating structural waves. The streamer
structure can be designed in such a way that the structural waves are
placed outside the acoustic window. This is normally achieved by
making the structural waves slower than the acoustic wave speed.
However these waves cannot, in
