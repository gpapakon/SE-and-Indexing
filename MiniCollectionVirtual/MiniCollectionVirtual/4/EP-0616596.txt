<ABSTRACT>
Relatively widely spaced (8) containers (2) travel on a first conveyor belt (3) at a relatively high speed in a first direction (4). The containers (2) are diverted on a continuously curved track (11) in a second direction (5) to a second conveyor belt (6). Between the conveyor belts (3, 6) there is an intermediate conveyor (14), the upper track (15) of which is driven in a third direction (16) at a slower speed that the first conveyor belt (3). The second conveyor belt (6) also runs at a slower speed than the first one (3), thus producing a relatively short second spacing (7) between the containers (2). A drive unit (10) has conveyor pins (9) on one side which engage between successive containers (2) and stops (13) of a supporting device (12) against which the containers (2) are held in a stationary position until they are transferred to the second conveyor belt (6). A working path (31) of the drive unit (10) is guided along the continuously curved track (11).
