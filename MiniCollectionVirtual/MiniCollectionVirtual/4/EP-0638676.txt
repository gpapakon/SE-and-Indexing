<ABSTRACT>
Described is a process for producing woven fabrics comprising the steps of:     i) producing a stabilised and size-free flat multifilament yarn,   ii) forming a warp from the flat multifilament yarn of step i), iii) leasing the warp formed in step ii) into the heddles of the shafts and into the reed of a weaving machine, and iv) producing a woven fabric through the insertion of weft threads in the transverse direction to the course of the warp at a weft insertion frequency of at least 300 picks/minute in a manner known per se.   In the process described, the tension on the stabilised and size-free flat multifilament yarn, from the mechanical stabilisation step until after passage through the reed, does not exceed 1.0 cN/dtex. Also described is a woven fabric comprising warp threads based on stabilised flat multifilament yarns woven without size, whose warp thread density is more than 30 ends/cm and whose weft thread density is at least 30 picks/cm.
