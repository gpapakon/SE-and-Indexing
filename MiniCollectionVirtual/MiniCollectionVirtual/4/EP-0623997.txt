voltage supply (Vcc) and of a type which comprises a 

composite structure incorporating first (2) and second (5) 
differential cells respectively comprised of an npn bipolar 

transistor pair (T1,T2) with common emitters, on the one 
side, and a pair of pnp bipolar transistor pair (T3,T4) with 

common emitters, on the other, such cells (2,5) being coupled 
together through the bases of the respective transistors. The 

circuit includes at least one pair of variable current 
sources (A1,A2;A3,A4) associated with each cell (2,5) and 

tied operatively to the voltage value present on the 
comparator (1) output (O); in addition, a voltage divider is 

connected between each interconnection of the bases

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an integrated comparator circuit
working with a low voltage supply.More specifically, the invention relates to an integrated
comparator comprising an input terminal to receive an input
voltage, a reference terminal to receive a reference voltage,
a first differential cell coupled to said input terminal and
said reference terminal and including a pair of npn bipolar
transistors with the emitters in common,a second differential
cell coupled to said input terminal and said reference
terminal and including a pair of pnp bipolar transistors with
the emitters in common, said first and second differential
cells being coupled together and to said input terminal and
said reference terminal through the bases of their respective
transistors.The field of application of the invention pertains in
particular to hysteresis comparators, and the description to
follow will make specific reference to this field of
application for convenience of illlustration.As is well known, comparators are circuits effective to
compare two DC voltage values with each other, and to output
two different set voltage values, according to whether an
input signal Vin is higher or lower than a reference voltage
Vr. Extensive use of comparators is made in integrated
circuits, e.g. for controlling logic gates.On the other hand, for certain specific applications, the use
of other hysteresis comparators is more appropriate, which
comparators distinguish themselves from the former type by 
that the switching between the two output logic values is
brought about by different input voltages.Of course, such comparators may also be implemented in
integrated circuit form, and a typical example of a prior art
integrated comparator is shown in Figure 1 of the
accompanying drawings.The comparator of Figure 1 comprises a differential cell
input stage which includes a first pair of bipolar
transistors, of the npn type, connected in a common emitter
configuration. The collectors of such transistors are
connected to a power supply line at a voltage Vcc=1 Volt, via
respective resistors. The bases of these transistors are
instead available to serve as circuit inputs, the one for the
reference voltage Vr and the other for the input signal Vin,
for example.A second pair of bipolar transistors, of the pnp type, are
associated with the input stage of the comparator. The bases
of the transistors in this second pair are connected together
and receive a bias voltage Vb1.The collectors of the first pair of npn transistors are each
connected to
