<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a circuit (7) for
minimizing glitches in phase-locked loops. The circuit is

of the type which comprises an input terminal (EXT)
connected to an input of a phase detector (8); a series of

a charge pump generator (9), a filter (10) and a voltage
controlled oscillator (11) connected downstream of the

phase detector (8); and a frequency divider (12) feedback
connected between an output of the voltage controlled

oscillator and a second input of the phase detector (8).
The invention provides for the inclusion of a compensation
circuit (13) connected between the charge pump generator

(9) and the filter (10) to absorb an amount of the charge
passed therethrough. This compensation circuit (13)

includes a storage element (14) connected in series to a
switch (15) which is controlled by a control signal (Cpoff)

from the charge pump generator (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and a circuit for
minimizing glitches in phase-locked loops.Specifically, the invention relates to a circuit for
minimizing glitches in phase-locked loops, of the type
which comprises an input terminal connected to an input of
a phase detector; a series of a charge pump generator, a
filter and a voltage controlled oscillator connected
downstream of the phase detector; and a frequency divider
feedback connected between an output of the voltage
controlled oscillator and a second input of the phase
detector.As is well known, a PLL (Phase Lock Loop) as generally
shown at 1 in Figure 1 comprises essentially a phase
comparator 2, a filter 3, a frequency divider 4, and a
voltage controlled oscillator VCO 5.With the phase lock loop PLL 1 locked to a periodic input
signal at a frequency Fref, the frequency Fvco of the
voltage controlled oscillator VCO 5 is equal to that of the
input signal multiplied by a division ratio N of the
frequency divider 4.The phase comparator 2 then generates a signal which is
proportional to the phase difference between the input
signal and the output signal of the frequency divider. This
signal modifies, through the filter 3, the control voltage
of the voltage controlled oscillator VCO 5, and
consequently its frequency Fvco as well, thereby bringing
the output frequency Fdiv of the frequency divider 4 to the
same value as the input frequency Fref. The characteristic parameters according to which a phase
lock loop PLL 1 is evaluated are:
accuracy of the generated frequency;phase noise;glitch rejection;locking time; andloop phase margin.The frequency accuracy of the voltage controlled oscillator
VCO 5 is dependent on the frequency accuracy of the input
signal and the accuracy of the phase comparator 2.Specifically, it is:
ΔFvco = N * ΔFref + ΔΦ/2*π * Fvco
where,
ΔFvco is the frequency error of the voltage controlled
oscillator VCO 5;N is the division ratio of the frequency divider 4;ΔFref is the frequency error of the input signal;ΔΦ is the phase error of the phase comparator 2; andFvco is the output frequency of the voltage controlled
oscillator VCO 5.System specifications covering certain communication
standards provide for the largest frequency error of the
voltage controlled oscillator VCO 5 to be in the 10-8*Fvco
range. For example, the GSM Standard sets the maximum error
to 2*10-8*Fvco. In this case, assuming one half of that frequency error to
be due to inaccuracy of the input frequency (usually
obtained from a crystal oscillator), the maximum
