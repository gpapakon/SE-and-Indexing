<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a ring oscillator.New manufacturing processes and new applications are forcing
power supplies to lower voltages (3.3v now, with 2.4v and 1.5v
being expected soon) . Advanced Phase-Locked Loops require stable
oscillators which may be varied in frequency by a control signal.To help achieve frequency stability, oscillators integrated into
a noisy VLSI environment often use a regulator to generate a
quiet power supply. This usually has to be at an even lower
voltage than the normal power supply.There is thus a desire to provide oscillators which can work at
these very low supply voltages and still produce high quality,
high frequency output signals.Reference is made to IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 31,
No. 2, July 1988, pages 154 to 156 "CMOS Ring Oscillator with
Controlled Frequency" which describes a ring oscillator using
CMOS transistors and designed to give an almost sinusoidal
output. This design suffers from stability problems outside a
narrow range of frequencies. In particular, as the frequency
increases, the amplitude decreases and it becomes difficult to
convert the signal to CMOS levels.IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, Vol. 32,
February 1989, New York, US, pages 192, 193 and 338 also
discloses a ring oscillator, which oscillator comprises three
inverter stages and is designed to produce a sinusoidal output.According to the present invention there is provided a ring
oscillator comprising a plurality of oscillator stages, each
stage comprising first and second transistors, wherein the first 
transistor has a controllable path connected between an output
node and a reference voltage and a control node acting as an
input node to the stage and wherein the second transistor has a
controllable path connected between the output node and the
reference voltage and a control node connected to the output
node, each stage further comprising a respective current source
comprising a transistor gated by a control voltage which controls
the speed of the stage and which is connected to said output
node, wherein the input node of one stage is connected to the
output node of a preceding stage to form said ring and wherein
the number of stages is selected so that there is a total phase
shift of 360° around the ring at the frequency of operation,
   characterised in that the gain of each stage is selectively
determined by the ratio m of the widths of the first and second
transistors to produce an output signal having a sawtooth or
trapezoidal waveform, where m ≥
