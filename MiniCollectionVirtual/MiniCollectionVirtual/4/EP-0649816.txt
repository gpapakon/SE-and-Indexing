<ABSTRACT>
Dendrite or asteroidal titanium dioxide micro-particles 
having a length of 0.2 to 0.5 µm, a thickness of 

0.05 to 0.1 µm, and a specific surface area of 20 to 130 
m²/gram, are produced by treating hydrated titanium oxide 

particles with an alkali, mixing instantaneously the 
resulting reaction product with an amount of hydrochloric 

acid in a ratio of 1 to 4 mols of hydrochloric acid to one 
mol of the titanium oxide in the reaction product to effect 

a reaction, then aging under heat at 85 °C or higher, and 
then drying or, if necessary, firing after the drying, and 

subsequently may be coated with at least one from oxides and 
hydrated oxides of elements selected from aluminum, silicon, 

titanium, zirconium, tin and antimony to improve the 
dispersibility and resistance to light of the particles, or 

may be coated with tin oxide containing antimony or indium 
oxide containing tin to make the particles 

electroconductive. These titanium dioxide micro-particles 
are useful for use in electroconductive paints, 

electroconductive resin compositions, paints and 
electroconductive paints for magnetic recording media, 

sunscreen cosmetics, UV screening paints and UV shielding 
plastic compositions and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dendritic or
asteroidal titanium dioxide micro-particles, a process for
producing the same, electroconductive dendritic or asteroidal
titanium dioxide micro-particles comprising said titanium
dioxide micro-particles as substrate which have been
subjected to an electroconductivity imparting treatment, and
a process for producing the same. The titanium dioxide
micro-particles according to the present invention are
useful for sunscreen preparations or cosmetics, UV screening
paints, UV screening or shielding materials in plastics,
electroconductivity imparting or antistatic materials to be
used in plastics, paints, rubbers and fibers, as well as
electroconductivity imparting agents or substrates to be
used in supports for recording materials such as
electrophotographic copying paper and electrostatographic
recording paper.Fine titanium dioxide particles having a primary
particle size of 0.1 µm or less are transparent because
they transmit rays of visible light when incorporated in
resin films or shapes, and on the other hand capable of
shielding ultraviolet radiation to protect materials which 
may be discolored or degenerated with ultraviolet radiation.
Thus they have different properties from those of pigment
titanium dioxide having a primary particle size of about
0.15 to 0.5 µm so that they have been utilized in sunscreen
preparations, UV screening paints, and UV screening or
shielding materials for plastics.With respect to the transparency and UV shielding
property of the aforementioned titanium dioxide micro-particles,
the former property increases inversely
proportional to the particle size, while the latter varies
with the particle size with reaching a maximum in a specific
range of the particle size and then decreasing as the
particle size increases over the specific range. That is,
the UV shielding property is reduced at particle sizes
either smaller or larger than the specific range.
Therefore, development of titanium dioxide micro-particles
having simultaneously satisfactory transparency and UV
shielding property has been desired.The aforementioned titanium oxide micro-particles
having a average primary particle size of about 0.05 to 0.1
µm have been produced by, for example, a process comprising
firing hydrated titanium dioxides produced by hydrolyzing a
solution of titanyl sulfate or titanium tetrachloride, or a
titania sol obtained by thermally treating the hydrated
titanium dioxides in the presence of hydrochloric acid after
treated with a caustic alkali.
