<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of labels which constitute portions of forms, a portion of the form which is backed with an adhesive and covered with a silicone-coated paper strip being at least partially stamped out, corresponding in outline to the size of the label, down as far as the paper strip, is distinguished by using an adhesive based on hot glue, by this adhesive being applied to the silicone side of the silicone-coated paper and by the paper thus glued and silicone-coated subsequently being applied with its glued side onto the form.

Process for the production of labels (60) which
constitute subregions of forms (40), in which process a

subregion that is backed with a contact adhesive (22) and
covered with a silicone-coated paper strip (16) is

stamped out circumferentially, at least partly, through
as far as the paper strip, corresponding to the size of

the label, characterized in that a contact adhesive based
on hot glue is applied to the silicone side of the

silicone-coated paper (16) and the silicone-coated paper
glued in this way is then applied with its glued side

onto the form.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the hot glue application is carried out by means of

a surface-laminating nozzle or by means of rolls.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that a continuously wound silicone paper reel is used.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the silicone-coated paper strip

coated with hot glue is applied to the rear side of the
form in a transfer process.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, during the application of the

contact adhesive, the silicone-coated paper is transported
at a lower speed than the form containing the

stuck-on silicone-coated paper strip.
Labels (60) which constitute subregions of forms
(40), in which a subregion that is backed with a contact

adhesive (22) and covered with a silicone-coated paper
strip (16) is stamped out circumferentially, at least

partly, through as far as the paper strip, corresponding
to the size of the label, produced in accordance with a

process of the preceding Claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that a contact adhesive based on hot glue is present.
