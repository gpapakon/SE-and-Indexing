<DESCRIPTION>
 Quaternary Pyridinium CompoundsBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a novel class of quaternary pyridinium compounds useful for selectively inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and to their use as nerve agent antidotes and prophylactics. We have found that certain quaternary pyridinium derivatives can offer in vivo protection against the nerve agents Soman (GD) and Tabun (GA) and therefore they can also offer protection against other organophophate poisons. We have also found that certain quaternary pyridinium derivatives can effectively increase the rate of survival of experimental animals exposed to the nerve agents GD and GA and therefore they can also serve as antidotes against other organophosphate poisons. All of the active pyridinium compounds are good AChE inhibitors in vitro and therefore they can also be used to treat conditions where a cholinergic deficit leading to pathology can be ameliorated by administration of an anticholinesterase agent. All of the pyridinium compounds described herein can have additional beneficial effects in living organisms by virtue of their resemblance to the natural neurotransmitter acetylcholine and their ability to act on cholinergic receptors.2. Description of the Related ArtDevelopment of an effective antidote to organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents has been a goal of medicinal chemists since the development of Tabun in Germany in 1937. OP agents react covalently with the active site serine hydroxyl group of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to form a stable phosphonyl ester which requires up to 30 days for hydrolysis ( Main, A. R. In Biology of Cholinergic Function; Goldberg, A. M., Hanin. I., Eds.; Raven Press: New York, 1976; pp. 269-353, incorporated herein by reference). Excess acetylcholine accumulates and causes severe neurological imbalance, respiratory paralysis, and death (Koelle, G. B. In The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics; Goodman, L., and Gilman, A., Eds.; MacMillan: New York, 1975; p. 404. incorporated herein by reference). Pyridinium aldoximes (2-PAM and HI-6, see structures below) are currently used in conjunction with an acetylcholine antagonist (atropine) to reactivate the phosphonylated serine hydroxyl group of AChE after 

poisoning occurs (Leadbeater. L., Inns, R.H., and Rylands. J. M. Fund. App. Toxtcol.1985. 5, S225, incorporated herein by reference). This treatment is ineffective against GD and GA because the initially formed enzyme bound alkyl phosphonate esters undergo rapid aging with loss
