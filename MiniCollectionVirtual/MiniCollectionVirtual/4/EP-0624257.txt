<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the alignment of components such
as integrated optical components.Difficulties are commonly experienced in mounting together
integrated optical components (such as a semiconductor
laser with optical fibres or planar waveguides, detectors,
fibre amplifiers and the like), with sufficient accuracy.One of the most demanding situations is the provision of
accurate alignment between a laser and waveguides. As an
example of this requirement, the case of a semiconductor
laser coupling to an AsG waveguide has been considered.
For maximum power transfer, the laser and guide should
exactly butt together. The coupling efficiency is limited
by the mismatch in the mode sizes of the two components.
For the structures of current interest, this results in an
efficiency of 45% or a loss of 3.5dB.In practice, it is not possible to achieve exact butt
coupling and it is therefore necessary to determine the
optimum separation between the laser and the guide where
axial alignment sensitivity is at its lowest. For
signalling type applications, a coupling efficiency between
the laser and waveguide of 10% or a loss of 10dB is seen as
the minimum acceptable value. Taking this figure as a 
target specification, the maximum horizontal and vertical misalignment allowable
has been calculated as a function of separation between the laser and the
waveguide. For the current case , it was found that a separation of 6µm gave the
lowest sensitivity to axial misalignment (1.7µm or 1.9µm in the vertical or
horizontal directions before loss in excess of the target value was obtained).These calculations do not take into account any angular deviation between
the laser and the waveguide and so should be viewed as a "best case" estimate.
As a result, the alignment tolerance sought in a motherboard process was taken as
less than 1µm in both the horizontal and vertical directions. If higher coupling
efficiencies than 10% are required, (e.g. in the case of laser pumping for optical
amplifiers), it would be necessary to match the node sizes of the two components
by use of, for example, a lensed laser assembly.It has been known to join two integrated circuit or chips by a so called
"flip-chip" solder bonding technique. The faces of the two integrated circuits
which are to be joined each contain a corresponding pattern of metal pads , and
one of the integrated circuits is provided with a solder bump on each metal pad,
the two integrated circuits are approximately aligned, the solder is melted, and the
solder, by surface
