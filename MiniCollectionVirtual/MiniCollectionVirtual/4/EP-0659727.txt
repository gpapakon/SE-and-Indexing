<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of benzoquinones by oxidising phenols in the presence of a diluent and of an oxygen-transferring catalyst which contains a complexed heavy-metal ion, in which process the oxidant used is oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, a compound which releases hydrogen peroxide, an organic hydroperoxide, a percarboxylic acid or a peroxomonosulphuric acid or salts thereof, and the oxygen-transferring catalyst is from the class of the iron, manganese or chromium tetraaza[14]annulenes.
