<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part 
application of Ser. No. 355,027 filed May 19, 1989 
hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention relates in general to 
metalloproteinase inhibitors and to polynucleotides 
encoding such factors. In particular, the invention 
relates to a novel mammalian metalloproteinase inhibitor 
(MI), to fragments and polypeptide analogs thereof and 
to polynucleotides encoding the same. Connective tissues are maintained in dynamic 
equilibrium by the opposing effects of cellular 
connective tissue synthesis and extracellular 
degradation. The extracellular connective tissue matrix 
consists predominantly of collagens, with proteoglycans, 
fibronectin, laminin and other minor components making 
up the remainder. Degradation of the matrix is brought about by 
the release of neutral metalloproteinases from resident 
connective tissue cells and invading inflammatory cells 
that are capable of degrading at physiological pH most 
of the matrix macromolecules. The proteinases include 
the mammalian tissue collagenases, gelatinases, and 
proteoglycanases; leukocyte collagenase and gelatinase 
[Murphy et al. Biochem. J. 283, 289-221 (1982); 
Hibbs et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2493-2500 (1985)]; 
macrophage collagenase and elastase [Werb et al. 
J. Exp. Med. 142, 346-360 (1975); Banda et al., 
Biochem. J. 193, 589-605 (1981)]; and tumour 
collagenases [Liotta et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 
76 2268-2272 (1979); Liotta et al., Biochem. Biophys. 
Res. Commun. 98, 124-198 (1981); and Salo et al.,  
 
J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3058-3063 (1983)]. For a general 
review of collagenases and their role in normal and 
pathological connective tissue turnover see Collagenase 
in Normal and Pathological Connective Tissues, 
David E. Woolley and John M. Evanson, eds., John Wiley & 
Sons Ltd. (1988). There are over five different collagen types 
(I, II, III, IV, V, etc.) which are differently 
distributed among tissues. There is considerable 
homology and structural similarity among the various 
collagen types. Particular collagenases are specific 
for particular collagen types. With regard to 
inhibition of collagenases and other matrix-degrading 
metalloproteinases, it is possible that, depending on 
the actual enzymes, substrates, and inhibitory 
mechanisms, an inhibitor could act on just one, on 
several, or on all collagenases and metalloproteinases. The underlying basis of degradative diseases 
of connective tissue points to the matrix-specific 
metalloproteinases as having a
