<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for texturing polymer foils, such as in particular circuit boards and foil circuit boards, using a plasma which is formed in a recipient by exciting gas mixtures by microwaves, in which method a surface temperature of the polymer foils is monitored during the texturing by the plasma and, by corresponding setting of parameters, is kept just below a material-damaging limit temperature for polymer foils, with the result that texturing or microformings are plasma-eroded in polymer foils without undue effects, in which method texturing or microformings are eroded quickly by the plasma at surface temperatures and with dense plasma and in which method texturings or microformings are homogeneously plasma-eroded with uniform distribution of the surface temperature and gas flow and with identical arrangement and movement of the polymer foils.

Process for structuring polymer films for
printed circuit boards and/or film circuit boards by

means of plasma action, using a container, in which
container gas mixtures are admitted, which gas mixtures

are excited energetically by electromagnetic radiation
to form a plasma, which plasma structures the polymer

films, the surface temperature of the polymer films in
the container being monitored during the structuring,

characterized in that the gas mixtures are excited
energetically by microwaves, in that the gas pressure

in the container is monitored during the structuring,
in that, to achieve a maximum erosion rate, linked sets

of parameters comprising excitation frequency, gas
pressure, gas flow, residence time, surface

temperature, container temperature, erosion period,
arrangement and movement of the polymer films are used

as independent sets for various maximized erosion tasks
for controlling the plasma erosion, in that from among

the existing sets the set desired for the erosion task
is respectively kept ready for loading, in that a

microwave energy with a frequency of 2.45 GHz or less
is absorbed by the gas mixtures, in that a power

density of at least 10 watts/litre is set and in that
the surface temperature is controlled just below a

material-damaging limit temperature for polymer films
so that micro-formations are plasma-eroded in polymer

films. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that micro-formations are homogeneously plasma-eroded

with homogeneous distribution of the surface
temperature and the gas flow and with the same

arrangement and movement of the polymer films.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the surface temperature is kept below the limit

temperature by the gas pressure and in that the gas
pressure is set by the flow and residence time of the

gas mixture in the container.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the gas pressure is set low enough to avoid the

polymer films being heated up above the limit
temperature by contact with the gas mixture and in that

the gas mixture is set high enough to avoid the polymer
films being heated up above the limit temperature by

microwaves not absorbed by the gas mixture.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the microwave frequency is set sufficiently high

to induce a plasma which is as dense as possible and
shields microwaves better with increasing frequency.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the surface temperature is kept below the limit

temperature by setting the power density of the
microwaves and in that the power density is set by

means of a microwave transmitter sufficiently high to
excite the gas mixture to form a plasma which is as

dense as possible.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that polyimide layers are used as polymer films for

printed circuit boards and/or film circuit boards and
in that polyimide layers with limit temperatures of

200°C are plasma-eroded.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that polyimide layers are used as polymer films for

printed circuit boards and/or film circuit boards and
in that polyimide layers are plasma-eroded at erosion

rates of greater than 1 µm/min. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a heating means is provided around the polymer

films in the container, so that the polymer films are
largely enclosed by the heating means and the heating

means functions as radiation protection and in that
heating the container is used as a means of forming a

temperature distribution in the container which is as
homogeneous as possible and a distribution of the

surface temperature of the polymer films which is as
homogeneous as possible and consequently homogeneous

plasma erosion takes place.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the gas flowing into the container is mixed at

baffle walls, in that the gas mixture is homogeneously
extracted via openings in distributor plates and in

that this has the effect of forming a gas flow in the
container which is as uniform as possible with a

homogeneous distribution of reactive particles in the
plasma and consequently homogeneous plasma erosion

takes place.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the polymer films are clamped in a charging basket

and in that, by turning the charging basket in the gas
flow, a homogeneous distribution of reactive particles

in the plasma is formed and consequently homogeneous
plasma erosion takes place.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized in
that, by being clamped in the charging basket

longitudinally with respect to the gas flow, the
polymer films offer minimal resistances to the gas flow

and are flowed over uniformly by reactive particles of
the plasma and consequently homogeneous plasma erosion

takes place.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, in a prior process step of a preheating phase,

the surface temperature is raised to just below the
limit temperature by igniting a non-eroding plasma, so

that a high and homogeneous rate of erosion is obtained 
right at the beginning of the plasma erosion and the

erosion period is shortened.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the surface temperature and its distribution are

sensed by a pyrometer, in that these data are digitized
by a signal integrator and stored on media, in that the

surface temperature and distribution are monitored with
respect to their variation over time, their continuity

and their relative distance from an upper limit
temperature by an algorithm and a computer, so that

differences between the setpoint value and actual
values of the surface temperature and the distribution

are controlled by activating a temperature controller.
Process according to Claim 14, characterized in
that, when there is a rise in the surface temperature

above the critical limit temperature, a microwave
transmitter is activated by the temperature controller

and the output of the said transmitter is cut back, so
that the density of the plasma is reduced and the

surface temperature is lowered below the critical limit
temperature.
Process according to Claim 14, characterized in
that, when the surface temperature is too low in

relation to the critical limit temperature, a microwave
transmitter is activated by the temperature controller

and its output is increased, so that the density of the
plasma is increased and the surface temperature is

raised to just below the critical limit temperature.
