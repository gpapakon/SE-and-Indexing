<ABSTRACT>
A heater for heating fluid is shown having a plurality of 
self-regulating electrical resistance heater elements 22 placed 

in electrically and thermally conductive relationship with heat 
transfer members 20, 120. The heat transfer members are each 

configured to form a plurality of fluid receiving channels so 
that when placed in a fluid stream heat generated by the heater 

elements will be dissipated to the fluid through the heat 
transfer members. The heater elements are arranged in groups 

with at least two heater elements in a group electrically 
connected in series and the groups electrically connected in 

parallel. 
In one embodiment, opposite ends of the heat transfer 
members 20 are received in recesses 14 formed in a pair of frame 

members 12 and along with the heater elements are subjected to a 
compressive force by spring members 16 mounted between the frame 

members at the top and bottom thereof. The heater elements 22 
are positioned by gaskets 24 which also prevent electrical 

shorting around the heater elements. Terminal members 26, 28 in 
the form of plates are provided with connector portions 26.1, 

28.1 which extend laterally therefrom and are adapted to be 
received through slots in the frame members for connection with 

rails 26.3, 28.3 received on respective frame members. The 
terminal plates 26, 28 are formed with a plurality of notches 

26.2, 28.2 so that the outer edges can be bent slightly to 
prevent dislocation of heat transfer members 20 and thereby add 

rigidity to the assembly. In alternate embodiments groups of two 
and three heater elements 22 electrically connected in series are 

shown mounted between heat transfer members 120.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to heaters and more 
specifically electric heaters employing heat transfer members 
used to heat fluids such as air. By way of example, compartment 
heaters for vehicles have used heat exchange fin members mounted 
in air passages with self-regulating electrical resistance heater 
elements of positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (PTC) 
mounted in heat transfer relation with the heat exchange fin 
members. Upon energization the self-regulating heater elements 
quickly increase in temperature to a so called anomaly 
temperature and they in turn heat up the fin members. Air 
directed through the passage is then heated by the heat exchange 
fin members. PTC heating is advantageous for several reasons. 
For example, such heaters are characterized by having fast warm 
up due to the heater material's low initial resistance yet the 
heaters do not overshoot, that is, the temperature of the heater 
is limited essentially at its anomaly temperature. PTC heating 
provides high output at low temperature and high airflow while 
maintaining a relatively constant operating temperature. Such 
heaters are of rugged construction compatible with high vibration 
and high temperature automotive environments, create no 
electrical or mechanical noise and have wide voltage range 
capability. An example of a heater of this type is shown and 
described in copending application Serial No. 07/571,379 
(Attorney Docket A18276), assigned to the assignee of the present 
invention.  Although there are no minimum flow requirements for PTC 
heaters as there would be for a conventional straight resistance 
heater which would overheat and burn-up under still air 
conditions, if the heater is proximate to materials which are 
sensitive to high temperatures, for example, low temperature 
plastic in the duct near the heater, then generally some type of 
control device is employed to de-energize the heater when air 
flow is below some minimum rate. It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel 
and improved heater for heating a fluid stream, to provide a 
heater particularly adapted for use for heating an air stream for 
an automotive passenger compartment or the like, to provide such 
a heater which is inexpensive to manufacture and assemble, to 
provide such a heater which is reliable, safe and efficient to 
use and to provide a heater which is more adaptable for use with 
temperature sensitive materials located proximate to the heater 
than prior art PTC heaters. Yet another object
