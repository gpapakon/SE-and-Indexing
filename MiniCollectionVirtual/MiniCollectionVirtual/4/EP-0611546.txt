<ABSTRACT>
The vacuum nozzle of the invention consists of a housing which is open at the floor side and in which a brush roller which is provided with brushes and can be driven by an electric motor is arranged. The speed of revolution of the brush roller can be controlled as a function of different suction parameters, the speed of revolution of the brush roller being detected indirectly or directly by at least one sensor and the signal of the sensor being converted in an electronic evaluation unit. This evaluation unit in turn supplies a control variable for the electric motor which drives the brush roller. In order to reduce the sensitivity to contamination of the sensing of the speed of revolution and thus of the control system, the sensor consists of an electro-acoustic sensor which is arranged in the region of at least one source, in particular in the region of the brush roller, which emits a noise which is dependent on the speed of revolution and/or load, in or on the housing of the vacuum nozzle.

A vacuum cleaner nozzle having a brush roller
disposed in a housing open at the bottom, said brush

roller being provided with bristles and adapted to be
driven by an electric motor, the speed of rotation of

which is adapted to be regulated in dependence on
different suction parameters, the speed of rotation of

the brush roller being detected directly or indirectly
by means of at least one sensor and the signal of said

sensor being converted, in an electronic evaluating
unit, to a control variable for the electric motor

driving the brush roller, characterised in that said
sensor is an electro-acoustic sensor, which is disposed

in or on the vacuum cleaner nozzle housing in the
region of at least one source emitting a speed-dependent

and/or load-dependent noise.
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to claim 1,
characterised in that the sensor detects the volume

and/or the frequency of the emitted noise.
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the electro-acoustic sensor

directly detects the speed-dependent brush roller
volume fluctuations.
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the electro-acoustic sensor

detects the speed-dependent electric motor volume
fluctuations as an indirect reference variable.
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the electro-acoustic sensor 

detects the speed-dependent volume fluctuations of a
fan of the electric motor as an indirect reference

value.
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to any one of
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a plurality of

electro-acoustic sensors are so disposed in or on the
vacuum cleaner nozzle housing that each of the sensors

respectively monitors a noise-emitting source, the
signals of all the sensors being fed to a single

evaluation and control unit.
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to any one of
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the detected

signals of the sensors or sensor are used as reference
value for other functions of the vacuum cleaner nozzle,

more particularly for the setting of the brush roller
relatively to the floor.
