<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mounting rack having two side walls (10, 11) and having honeycomb sheets (20) which are arranged between the side walls and are connected to transverse profiled rails (15, 16). In the case of such a mounting rack, it is intended to ensure reliable radiation-proof sealing at low cost. This is achieved according to the invention in that two transverse profiled rails (15, 16) with one honeycomb sheet and with two side profiled rails in each case form an RF-proof, intrinsically autonomous structural unit which can be preassembled.
