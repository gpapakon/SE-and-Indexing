<ABSTRACT>
A logging-tool assembly (16) for generating both flexural wavefields and compressional wavefields in the sidewall formations (30) encountered by a borehole (10). The assembly consists of a sonde (16) constructed of a plurality of segments (34, 36) that are axially rotatable with respect to each other. Each one of two of the segments includes a compartment in which is mounted a dipole bender bar transmitting transducer (40). Two additional segments (100, 102) each contain one or more binaurally sensitive receiver transducers (108, 110). Monopole transmitting (44) and receiving (110) transducers are also included in the respective appropriate segments. An acoustic isolator (29) of novel construction acoustically separates the transmitting transducers from the receiving transducers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to Application Serial Number 970,674, now U.S.
Patent Number 5,229,553 (AW-92-08D), filed concurrently herewith and assigned to
the same assignee as this invention.Disclosed is an improved acoustic downhole logging tool for measuring certain
rock parameters indicative of selected properties of the sidewall material of a borehole,
in both cased and in open holes. The tool is particularly useful in circumstances where
the sidewall material is characterized by an acoustic velocity that is lower than the
propagation velocity of an acoustic pulse in the borehole fluids.Acoustic logging tools for measuring properties of the sidewall material of both
cased and uncased boreholes are well known. Essentially such tools measure the travel
time of an acoustic pulse propagating through the sidewall material over a known
distance. In some studies, the amplitude and frequency of the acoustic pulse, after
passage through the earth, are of interest.In its simplest form, an acoustic logger consists of one or more transmitter
transducers that periodically emit an acoustic pulse into the formation around the
borehole. One or more receiver transducers, spaced apart by a known distance from
the transmitter, hears the pulse after passage through the surrounding formation. The
difference in time between pulse transmission and pulse reception divided into the
distance between the transducers is the formation velocity. If the transducers do not
contact the borehole sidewall, allowance must be made for time delays through the
borehole fluid.Throughout this disclosure, the term "velocity", unless otherwise qualified, shall
be taken to mean the velocity of propagation of an acoustic wavefield through an elastic
medium. The term does not mean the velocity of motion of a medium.Acoustic wavefields propagate through elastic media in different modes. The
modes include: Compressional or P-waves, wherein particle motion is in the direction
of wave travel; shear or S-waves, which, assuming a homogeneous, isotropic medium, 
may be polarized in two orthogonal directions, with motion perpendicular to the
direction of wave travel; Stonley waves, which are guided waves that propagate along
the fluid-solid boundary of the borehole; and compressional waves that propagate
through the borehole fluid itself. There also exist asymmetrical flexural waves as will
be discussed later.P-waves propagate through both fluids and solids. Shear waves cannot exist in
a liquid. Compressional waves propagating through the borehole
