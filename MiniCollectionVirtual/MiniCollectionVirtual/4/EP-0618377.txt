<ABSTRACT>
A fluid bearing assembly for rotatably supporting a 
rotary-driven spindle (9) having smooth bearing surfaces 

(11,13,14). Each bearing has a stationary housing holding 
an annular bearing race (49,50,51,52) that presents a smooth 

continuous bearing surface (53,54,55,56) facing a 
complementary bearing surface (11,13,14) of the spindle (9); 

together the race and spindle define a continuous, thin, 
uniform crevice space (57). 
The smooth race bearing surface 
is interrupted by a plurality of circumferentially spaced 

pressure generating zones (Z), each capable of dynamically 
compressing a fluid body contained in the zone into the 

crevice (57) in either direction of rotation of the spindle 
(9) at higher speeds. Pressurized fluid is supplied to flow 

through each zone and out of the crevice while exerting a 
predetermined hydrostatic force against the spindle (9) at 

lower rotational speeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the making and use of 
hydrodynamic or hydrostatic fluid bearings for supporting 
rotary machining spindles located in such bearings and, more 
particularly, to the art of hybridizing such hydrodynamic 
and hydrostatic bearings to permit such bearings to operate 
effectively at slow speeds as well as variable high speeds 
up to 40,000 rpm. Hydrostatic liquid or gas bearings alone are useful in 
providing a fluid film that supports a rotating spindle at 
relatively low speeds for machining operations. Such 
bearings may have thick hydrostatic sills extending 
extensively along a substantial length of the shaft to be 
supported (see U.S. patent 5,010,794), or the bearings may 
have a concentrated, thin, radial port acting as the 
hydrostatic chamber. Such hydrostatic bearings are limited 
because they cannot be used under heavy industrial loading 
at varying rotational spindle speeds where the range between 
the minimum and maximum intended use speeds for the spindle 
is greater than 10,000 rpm. Any combination of pressure and 
viscosity designed into such bearings cannot accommodate 
both extreme ends of the spindle speed range and thus causes 
excessive heat to be generated at the extreme high end or 
failure to form a good bearing film at the other end. Hydrodynamic fluid bearings alone have found use in 
supporting machining spindles. Ramped pressure generating 
zones have been defined on the outer surface of spindles, 
such ramps extending along a sector of the circumference of 
the spindle, such as 60°, accompanied by a varying profile 
shape that is extremely difficult to machine (see U.S. 
patent 4,693,642). Hydrodynamic bearings inherently are 
unstable at low spindle speeds due to insufficient dynamic 
pressure if the spindle loading is heavy; at high spindle 
speeds, i.e., 20,000-40,000 rpm, the bearing fluid may 
become thin due to heat and affect bearing performance.  
 What is needed is an integrated fluid bearing system 
that can attain at least 70.3 kg per square cm (1000 psi) hydrodynamically at higher 
speeds (i.e., 10,000-40,000 rpm) while retaining controlled 
hydrostatic pressures at lower speeds, thereby providing 
enhanced stiffness for a spindle subject to large side or 
thrust loads even at a variety of speeds. This invention as defined in claims 1 and 13 respectively achieves the above object by (i) use of 
a thin, continuous, uniform space for fluid that extends 
around and between the spindle and race to form a 
circumferential squeeze crevice, and
