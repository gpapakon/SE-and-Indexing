<ABSTRACT>
It is the object of the invention to provide a field 
emission cathode apparatus comprising plural electron-emitters 

which eliminates nonuniformity of electric emission density over 
an emissive area, controls emission currents by active devices, 

and improves reliability of the apparatus. A p-type silicon 5 
and a n-type silicon 4 are formed on a n⁺-type silicon 6. On n-type 

silicon 4, an electron-emitter 1 made of Mo is formed, and 
an electron-emitter 1 is surrounded by a grid electrode 2 and an 

insulator layer 3. A n-type silicon 4 serves as a channel region 
of a junction gate field effect transistor, and a current flowing 

through it is controlled by a voltage applied to a p-type silicon 
5. Accordingly, an electron current emitted from an electron-emitter 

1 is also controlled by this transistor, and by setting 
up an operation region of this transistor in a saturation current 

region, nonuniformity of electron emissions from electron-emitters 
can be improved. Even when a portion of cathodes are 

damaged, damages are not magnified to that of a whole apparatus, 
and a life of a field emission cathode can be prolonged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a field emission cathode
apparatus, especially to a field emission cathode apparatus in
which every cone shaped elementary electron emitter (electron-emitter,
hereinafter) is controlled by an active device.Field emission apparatus is widely used in various
equipments such as cathode ray tubes of displays, vacuum tubes
for microwave technologies or sensors as electron sources.A conventional field emission cathode apparatus
comprises two important parts; one is a cathode electrode, and
another one is a grid electrode.A cathode electrode comprises a metallic plane and
cones shaped electron-emitters with upward apecies, which are
made of a metal with high melting point. Cone shaped electron-emitters
are positioned on lattice points which is assumed on a
metallic plane.A grid electrode is a planar plate of a metal with high
melting point and provided with circular holes, centers of which
are positioned on lattice points assumed on a planar plate.
Geometrical parameters of two sets of lattice points are quite
the same.Cathode and grid electrodes are combined such that,
planar portions of these electrodes are parallel to each other,
and an apex of each cone shaped electron-emitter is surrounded 
by a inner periphery of a circular hole of a grid electrode.In this construction, when a voltage is applied between
cathode and a grid electrode, high electric field is generated
around an apex of electron-emitter, and thereby electrons are
emitted from an apex, which is known as high field emission.On a field emission cathode apparatus, however, several
disadvantages have been pointed out.
(1) When there are random imperfections in shapes or
dimensions of electron-emitters or a grid electrode,
nonuniformity of electron emission arises over a whole emissive
area of the apparatus.(2) When a break down arises between a electron-emitter
and a grid electrode, there is no means to suppress a
short circuit current, and a scale of damage is magnified.(3) There is no means to control magnitude of electron
emission, and therefore this cathode apparatus is unsuitable for
display means.EP-A-0 496 572 discloses an integrally controlled field
emission display device wherein at least a controller,
realized as a transistor device, is disposed in/on at least
a layer of said field emission display device and is operably
connected to at least one element of the field emission
device of the field emission display device. A plurality
of integrally formed controllers may be selectively
interconnected to provide
