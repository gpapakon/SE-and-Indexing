<ABSTRACT>
In a computer system including a plurality of interlinked 
computers, one computer generates a common image which is 

distributed to the other computers. Users of the computers can 
annotate the common image by highlighting, drawing lines, 

and/or typing text. The annotations are replicated on the other 
computers. The highlighting may be transparent or opaque and 

may be effected by moving a cursor to leave a coloured trail.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a computer system including a 
plurality of interlinked computers. Modern telephone systems allow different locations to hold 
a conference. However, telephone conferences do not provide 
all of the conveniences of a face-to-face conference, where 
participants all meet at a common table in a meeting room. For 
example, in a meeting room, participants can view an object of 
interest, such as a drawing or a product. Such viewing is not 
possible in a telephone conference. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
computer system including a plurality of interlinked computers, 
wherein a common image displayed on the computer may be 
annotated in an efficient manner. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is 
provided a computer system including a plurality of interlinked 
computers, characterized by annotation means adapted to allow 
users of the computers to make annotations on the common 
image by highlights on the common image; and storage means 
adapted to store annotation data at a different location from 
image data. One embodiment of the present invention will now be 
described by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which:- Figure 1 illustrates three computers, connected by 
telephone lines. Figure 2 initiates an example, which will be elaborated in 
Figures 3 - 14. In the example, a calculator program is  
 
operated, and annotated, by various parties. Figure 3 illustrates how the system responds when a host 
user attempts to operate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 4 illustrates how the system responds when a host 
user attempts to annotate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 5 illustrates how the system responds when a host 
user attempts to operate the calculator, in Application mode. Figure 6 illustrates how the system responds when a host 
user attempts to operate the calculator, in Local Annotation 
mode. Figure 7 illustrates how the system responds when a host 
user attempts to annotate the calculator, in Local Annotation 
mode. Figure 8 illustrates how the system responds to a host user 
when in View mode. Figure 9 illustrates how the system responds when a 
remote user attempts to operate the calculator, in Annotation 
mode. Figure 10 illustrates how the system responds when a 
remote user attempts to annotate the calculator, in Annotation 
mode. Figure 11 illustrates how the system responds when a 
remote user attempts to operate the calculator, in Application 
mode. Figure 12 illustrates

<CLAIMS>
A computer system including a plurality of interlinked 
computers, characterized by annotation means adapted to allow 

users of the computers to make annotations on the common 
image by highlights on the common image; and storage means 

adapted to store annotation data at a different location from 
image data. 
A computer system according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said highlights are transparent highlights. 
A computer system according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said highlights have the same colour as the portion of the 

image being highlighted. 
A computer system according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said highlights change the colour of the image being 

highlighted. 
A computer system according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterized in that said annotation means is 

further adapted to allow users of the computers to make 
annotations on the common image by typing text onto the 

common image. 
A computer system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said annotation means is 

further adapted to allow users of the computers to make 
annotations on the common image by drawings lines on the 

common image. 
A computer system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said storage means is 

adapted to store the annotated document; in that retrieval means 
are provided for retrieving the annotated document from storage 

and displaying it; and in that editing means are provided adapted 
 

to allow a user to edit the annotated document. 
A computer system according to claim 7, characterized 
in that said editing means is adapted to remove all annotations in 

a single sequence of commands.
