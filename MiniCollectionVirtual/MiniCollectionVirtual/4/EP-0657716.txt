<ABSTRACT>
The resetting mechanism for electronic theodolite of the present invention 
comprises a horizontal shaft (2) for vertically turning telescope (1), first 

cam (3) provided at one end of the horizontal shaft, a lock lever (4) limited 
by the first cam, a second cam (5) locked or released by the lock lever, a 

lock member (6) operated by the second cam, a lock concave (1a) provided on 
the telescope to be locked by a lock member when the telescope is turned to 

right down lock position, and an encoder set to a zero position when the 
telescope is turned to a right down lock position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic theodolite, 
more particularly to a resetting mechanism thereof. To set a reference position on a vertical plane of a 
telescope of usual electronic the odolites, in general, the 
telescope has to be directed just above once. After this, it is 
turned in a desired direction before an elevation angle OR 
depression angle is measured. A device for setting a theodolite is, 
for example, disclosed in GB-A-1 344 287. However, it is a problem that such an apparatus is hard to 
reset and needs a high skill. To solve the above-mentioned problem, an object of the 
present invention is to provide an electronic theodolite that 
zero setting is already made at start of use. The resetting mechanism for electronic theodolite 
according to the present invention comprises a horizontal shaft 
to vertically turn a telescope, first cam provided at one end of 
the horizontal shaft, a lock lever limited by the first cam, a 
second cam locked or released by the lock lever, a lock member 
operated by the second cam, and an encoder set to a zero position 
when the telescope is turned to a right down lock position. The telescope has a lock concave which is locked at the 
zero position by the lock member, and the first cam has a 
projection portion which presses the lock lever when the 
telescope is turned right down. The second cam has a step which is locked by the lock 
lever when the lock lever is operated by the first cam, a cam 
portion which presses the lock member at the same time, an  
 
interlocking mechanism which turns on or off a power switch of 
the whole theodolite apparatus and a handle. The lock member has a projection portion which is inserted 
into the lock concave of the telescope when it is pressed by the 
second cam. Other objects and advantages of the invention will become 
more apparent from the following portion of this specification 
and from the accompanying drawings. Fig.1 is a partially cross-sectioned front view of the 
electronic theodolite according to the present invention, with 
it being locked. Fig. 2 is a partially cross-sectioned front view of the 
electronic theodolite according to the present invention, with a 
telescope being held horizontally in use. Fig. 3 is a side view of the electronic theodolite 
according to the present invention, with a cover for the 
telescope and upper portion being omitted wherein the dotted line 
illustrates the housed position and the solid line illustrates 
the activated position. A front side of a main body of

comprising horizontal shaft means (2) for vertically 

rotating a telescope (1); a first cam (3) provided at one end 
of the horizontal shaft; a lock lever (4), the first cam (3) 

limiting the position of the lock lever (4); a second cam (5) 
locked or released by the lock lever (4); a lock member (6) 

operated by the second cam (5); means setting the 
electronic theodolite to a zero position when the 

telescope (1) is rotated to a fully down locked position; 
the telescope (1) having a concave locking recess (1a) for 

locking it in a zero position by the lock member (6), the 
first cam (3) having a projection portion (3a) contoured to 

press the lock lever (4) when the telescope (1) is turned fully 
down; the second cam (5) having a stepped portion (5a) locked by 

the lock lever (4) when the lock lever (4) is not pressed by 
the first cam (3), a cam portion (5b) pressing the lock member (6) 

when said second cam (5) is rotated, and means (6c) for turning 

on or off a power switch of the electronic theodolite 
in accordance with a rotation of said second cam (5); the 

lock member (6) having a projection piece (6c) engaging the 
concave lock recess (1a) of the telescope (1) when the lock 

member (6) is pressed by the second cam (5).
