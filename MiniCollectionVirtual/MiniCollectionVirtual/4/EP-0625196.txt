 NEUROTROPHIC FACTORINTRODUCTIONTechnical FieldThe invention relates to neurotrophic factors useful in treating neurodegenerative diseases that affect the ciliary ganglion and parasympathetic ganglia. The factors find use in maintaining viability of parasympathetic neurons and enhancing acetylcholine formation in certain eye diseases.BackgroundGlaucoma is a disease characterized by an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), cupping of the optic nerve head, loss of visual field and parasympathetic neuropathy, but the cause of glaucoma is unknown. Pathological changes (neuropathy) in the parasympathetic (ciliary and pterygopalatine) innervation of the ciliary muscle may be a cause of glaucoma; the cause of the pathological changes is unknown.In a number of conditions where nerves are damaged or destroyed, the target organ atrophies or exhibits abnormal functions. The survival of the neurons is essential for the maintenance of normal target organ function.Moreover, a mutually beneficial, reciprocal relationship exists between the target tissue and neuron. While the target tissue supplies neurotrophic factors (NTFs) for neurons, the neurons also provide trophic support and regulate the function of the target tissue. Indeed, in many cases and in clinical disorders, when the neurons die there is atrophy and loss of function of the target tissue.Neurotrophic factors are believed to be both elaborated by target tissues and released by wound-repair cells and taken up into nerve terminals or at nerve cell bodies. Some factors may be transported in a retrograde fashion to nerve cell bodies. Neurons are dependent on neurotrophic factors (NTFs) not only for survival and function, but also for wound-repair, and many NTFs are thought to exist, each directed against a specific neuronal type or in some cases, several neuronal types. While the NTFs are usually produced in extraordinarily small 

quantities by target tissues, such as ciliary muscle and iris, or by wound repair cells, several NTFs have been at least purified and shown to possess survival- promoting effects in vitro.In view of the fact that there seem to be a large number of different neurotrophic growth factors, which appear to have different characteristics and different properties somewhat analogous to the family of interleukins, it is of great interest to be able to identify all of the naturally occurring NTFs, characterize them as to their physiological activities, either individually or in combination, and to determine their utility in treating a wide
