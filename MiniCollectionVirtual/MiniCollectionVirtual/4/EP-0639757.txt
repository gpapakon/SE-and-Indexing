<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid level sensors mounted
through the sidewall of a liquid container rather than through the top or
bottom thereof, and to the method of assembly thereof.To monitor the liquid level in a liquid container, such as an
automobile coolant overflow reservoir or windshield washer tank, it has
been the practice to provide a liquid level sensor mounted from the top of
the container, such as from the cap thereof. Such a liquid level sensor
includes a vertical post or rod-like member with a reed switch held
adjacent to the top of the rod. The rod passes through the aperture of a
toroidal buoyant member mounted around the rod with the toroid carrying
a magnet along its top or bottom side so that as the buoyant member rises
and falls with the level of liquid in the container, the magnet moves
towards and away from the reed switch to open or close same depending
on the level of the liquid in the container. An electric circuit connected to
the reed switch turns on a light, for example, if the liquid level is unacceptable. As vehicle manufacturers try to reduce the overall size of the
vehicle, there has been a tendency to squeeze the container into locations
that make it impractical to mount the liquid level sensor from the cap of
the container. As a result, it has been proposed to mount the sensor
through the sidewall of the container. Unfortunately, such an arrangement
causes the rod to lay horizontal such that the buoyant toroid can no longer
move with changes in liquid level.Various proposals to change the construction of the sensor
for side-mount applications are believed to be undesirable. In one
proposal, the reed switch is positioned within the rod and the aperture
through the buoyant toroid significantly enlarged into a slot so that the
buoyant member may rise and fall relative the now-horizontally disposed
rod. The magnet is repositioned to the side wall of the buoyant member
parallel to the rod so as to open or close the reed switch as the liquid level
changes.Such a device is disclosed in FR-A-2, 153, 327.
This document discloses an indicator for warning of low
fluid level in a master cylinder reservoir having an
electrical reed switch mounted horizontally in the wall
of a fluid reservoir and connected to appropriate
indicator circuitry for warning the vehicle operator of
the low fluid condition. The reed switch is actuated by
a permanent magnet encapsulated in a float whenever the
fluid level becomes dangerously low. While such a proposal now allows for side-mounting
