<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to herbicidal
compositions, and more particularly relates to
herbicidal compositions containing one or more N-phosphonomethylglycine
salts and a surfactant.N-Phosphonomethylglycine, known in the
agricultural chemical art as glyphosate, is a highly
effective and commercially important phytotoxicant
useful in controlling the growth of germinating seeds,
emerging seedlings, maturing and established woody and
herbaceous vegetation, and aquatic plants. N-phosphonomethylglycine
and its salts are conveniently
applied in an agueous solution as a post-emergent
phytotoxicant for the control of numerous plant species.
N-Phosphonomethylglycine and its salts are characterized
by a broad spectrum activity, i.e., they control growth
of a wide variety of plants.Commercial formulations of N-phosphonomethylglycine
are usually aqueous solutions wherein the
N-phosphonomethylglycine is present as a herbicidally
acceptable salt, such as an alkali metal salt, the
ammonium, alkylsulfonium, or alkylphosphonium salt or
the salt of an amine having a molecular weight of less
than about 300. The monoisopropylamine salt of
N-phosphonomethylglycine is the most widely used salt in
such aqueous compositions. In addition, such
compositions usually contain a surfactant to enhance the
effectiveness of the N-phosphonomethylglycine when it is
applied to the foliage of various plants. The most
widely used surfactant in commercial compositions is an
ethoxylated fatty amine.It is known to those skilled in the art that a
particular surfactant used in an aqueous composition
with a herbicide can enhance the effectiveness of the
herbicide, whereas other surfactants have very little,
if any beneficial effect, and in fact, some may be
antagonistic. Wyrill and Burnside, Weed Science, 
Vol. 25 (1977), p 275-287, examined dilute N-phosphonomethylglycine
salt solutions containing different
classes of surfactants, including polyoxyethylene
octadecyl methyl ammonium chlorides containing on
average 2 and 15 oxyethylene units (ETHOQUAD 18/12 and
ETHOQUAD 18/25, respectively). They did not examine or
suggest the use of shorter-chain alkyl methyl ammonium
chlorides. Some classes of surfactant were more
effective than others in enhancing the herbicidal effect
of N-phosphonomethylglycine (used as a solution of the
isopropylamine salt), and Wyrill and Burnside concluded
that an effective surfactant is a critical component of
any aqueous composition containing N-phosphonomethylglycine.
For example, ETHOQUAD 18/12 was relatively
ineffective
