<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is presented for successively interrupting the transmission of light through a transparent body at a frequency such that a scene viewed through the transparent body by a human eye is perceived as a continuous image that is less bright than actually, and is viewed with minimal color distortion. In one aspect of the invention, the lenses (17, 18) of spectacles (16) are provided with a layer of liquid crystal material that is normally transparent, but which responds to the application of an electrical charge (24) to render the liquid crystal layer non-transparent. By adjusting the frequency of application of successive electrical charges, the lenses (17, 18) admit light at full brightness for small increments of time, with minimal color distortion, and interrupt the transmission of light for small increments of time, so that the light admitted at full brightness is perceived as being less bright or dimmed. In another aspect, the transparent body (36) is ''nodalized'' so that small increments of the body are independently responsive to successive electrical charges, whereby the brightness of light passing through such ''nodes'' (37) is perceived as being less bright or dimmed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control of brightness
perceived by the human eye, and more particularly to
spectacles and a method of controlling the light passing
through a spectacle lens.United States Patent 3,245,315 discloses a light
controlling device that is particularly adapted to protect
the eyes from flashblindness. A sensor mounted on the
spectacle frame "sees" the flash and initiates the
application of an electric charge on the electro-optic
crystal material included in the lenses, resulting in the
lenses becoming opaque for the duration of the flash and
then reverting to transparency. Also disclosed by this
patent is a method for controlling brightness by reducing
the steady-state light intensity reaching the eyes of the
wearer of the spectacles through adsorption of the light
impinging on the lenses.United States Patent 3,409,909 discloses a device to
protect against flashblindness of the type that might be
imposed by the explosion of an atomic bomb. A light sensor
initiates the release and dispersion of an opaque liquid on
the interior of a cavity between two transparent lenses,
thus attenuating the light seeking to pass through the
lenses.United States Patent 3,603,305 does not relate to
brightness control. Rather, this patent is directed to a
sensory development apparatus, conveniently in the form of
spectacles, useful to aid in the "fusion" process that
occurs in the brain of a human to perceive the images
transmitted to the retina by the eyes. Stated in other
words, the apparatus described by this patent is
particularly useful to aid visually impaired individuals to
achieve visual fusion. United States Patent 3,630,603 describes spectacles
incorporating lenses than can be darkened to reduce the
steady-state light level reaching the eyes. Brightness
control is achieved through steady-state dimming as with
conventional sunglasses.United States Patent 4,272,164 describes a device to
protect image intensifiers from glare using an
electrochemical material.Thus, it will be seen that the devices discussed above
all reduce the steady-state light level by turning
partially or totally opaque with the level of brightness
controlled by the amount of opacity as in conventional
sunglasses.United States Patent 4,279,474 discloses a pair of
spectacles where the perceived brightness seen through a
lens is controlled by controlling the time the observers
eye is exposed to the actual brightness.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is the
provision of spectacles and a method of controlling the
light

<CLAIMS>
Spectacles comprising:

at least one lens (36) comprising a transparent
body covered with a matrix pattern of individually

controllable liquid crystal shutter means (37) not
perceptible to the naked eye when the spectacles are

being worn by a user and defining plural segments (48)
of a field of view, each shutter means being

adjustable from a normally transparent open state to
a substantially non-transparent closed state;
an independent optical sensing device (47)
operatively associated with each segment of the field

of view, for measuring the average intensity of light
impinging thereon; and
control means (49, 51) responsive to the measured

light intensity for cyclically and independently
opening and closing each shutter means at a

sufficiently high frequency above the human flicker
fusion threshold to give a continuous flickerless view

and for independently controlling for each segment of
the field of view the level of brightness perceived by

regulating the fraction of time during each cycle in
which the shutter means, defining the respective

segment of the field of view, is in the open state.
Spectacles as claimed in Claim 1 in which each shutter
means (37) comprises a layer of liquid crystal

material responsive to the application of an
electrical charge thereto to oscillate light

transmissibility thereof between the open and closed
states.
Spectacles as claimed in Claim 2 in which the control
means (49) comprises a light sensor/amplifier circuit (47)

operatively connected to each shutter means (37) and 
responsive to the intensity of light impinging thereon

to output an electrical voltage proportional to the
intensity of light impinging on the light sensor, a

silicon controlled rectifier circuit connected to each
amplifier circuit (49) to receive the electrical voltage,

an oscillator circuit (51) connected in common with all the
silicon controlled rectifier circuits whereby each

silicon controlled rectifier outputs a series of
voltage pulses having a width correlated to the light

intensity of light impinging on the respective segment
of the field of view.
Spectacles as claimed in any preceding claim which has
a battery (23) as a power source.
Spectacles as claimed in claim 4 in which the power
source further comprises a solar cell (26).
Spectacles as claimed in any preceding claim in which
the spectacles include a frame (19) on which two

lenses (17, 18) are supported, a pair of temple
members (21, 22) pivotally mounted on the frame for

supporting the spectacles on the face of the user,
and in which the control means (49) is mounted on the

spectacles and includes a control knob (28)
selectively adjustable by the user to set the

desired level of brightness to suit the user's
needs.
A method of controlling the light passing a spectacle
lens (36) comprising a transparent body covered with

a matrix pattern of individually controllable liquid
crystal shutter means (37) not perceptible to the

naked eye and defining plural segments (48) of afield
of view, each shutter means (37) being independently

cycled between a normally transparent open state and 
a substantially non-transparent closed state at a

sufficiently high frequency above the human flicker
fusion threshold to give a continuous flickerless view

and independently controlling the level of brightness
for each segment by controlling the fraction of time

during each cycle that the segment is in the open
state.
A method as claimed in Claim 7 which additionally
independently senses the average time rate of increase

of light intensity passing through a segment, and
independently controls the time rate of increase of

brightness for each segment to be no greater than a
brightness rate setpoint value.
