<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming a PZT strong dielectric film by the sol-gel 
techn
ique, in which the thickness of the film is substantially 
no greater than 1000 Å. In another aspect, the drying temperature 

of the raw material sol-gel solution for forming the PZT dielectric 
film is maintained within the range of 130-200°C, and is 

particularly set lower than the boiling point of the stabilizer 
contained in the sol-gel raw material and higher than the boiling 

point of the solvent contained in the sol-gel raw material. As a 
result of performing the oxidative sintering treatment at a 

temperature at which perovskite crystals form, it becomes possible 
to readily form thin films exhibiting a (100) crystal orientation 

in particular. Additionally, completely crack-free thick films can 
be formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method for forming a strong 
dielectric film (in particular, a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) 
film) by the sol-gel technique and a method for manufacturing a 
capacitor (in particular, a capacitor for a semiconductor memory 
cell). Examples of insulating films (dielectric films) that are used 
in capacitors for dynamic RAM memory include ONO films with a 
structure obtained by sequentially laminating SiO₂, SI₃N₄, and SiO₂. However, because ONO films have a dielectric constant of 
approximately 5, when they are used in large-capacity memories of 
more than 256 Mb, they entail major process problems that include 
the necessity to form them into complex configurations in order to 
expand the area or reduce the thickness of the capacitor's 
dielectric film due to restrictions with regard to area. In contrast, strong dielectric film materials with a 
perovskite crystal structure have extremely high dielectric 
constants of a few hundred to a few thousand, and therefore have 
attracted attention as insulating film materials for capacitors for 
use in dynamic RAM devices in the future. Of such strong dielectric film materials, the use of a thin-film 
forming method called the sol-gel technique is known in 
forming PZT films expressed by Pb(Zr, Ti)O₃. In Figure 18, a method for forming Pb(Zr, Ti)O₃ thin films by 
the sol-gel technique is explained. First, in process 1, a precursor consisting of the sol-gel raw 
material solution is prepared by the hydrolysis and condensation 
polymerization of a metal alkoxide; in process 2, this is then 
applied to a substrate by, e.g., spin coating or dip coating, after 
which in process 3 the resulting article is dried at a temperature  
 
of 100-300°C to form the applied sol-gel thin film into a dry gel 
(polymer gel). In process 4, an oxidative sintering treatment is 
carried out in a 600°C or above high- temperature oxygen 
atmosphere, then a Pb(Zr, Ti)O₃ thin film sinter with a perovskite 
crystal structure is obtained from the resulting dry gel to 
conclude the process. When it is desired to increase the thickness 
of the obtained PZT film, the aforementioned processes 2 and 3 are 
repeated. Here, conventionally solutions obtained by diluting the 
organometal compounds that constitute structural metal elements 
Pb(CH₃COO)₂·3H₂O (lead acetate), Ti(i-OC₃H₇)₄ (titanium isopropoxide), 
and Zr(i-OC₃H₇)₄ (zirconium isopropoxide) and the stabilizer 
NH(C₂H₆OH)₂ (diethanolamine, hereinafter referred to as DEA) with 
the solvent CH₃OC₂H₄OH
