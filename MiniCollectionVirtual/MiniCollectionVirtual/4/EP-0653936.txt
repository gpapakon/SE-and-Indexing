<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of cancer. More particularly, the invention 
is concerned with the use of 2-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone 
and physiologically acceptable salts and physiologically functional 
derivatives thereof as anti-tumour agents, and the use of said compound for the 
manufacture of medicaments for the treatment of cancer. Research in the area of cancer chemotherapy has produced a variety of anti-tumour 
agents, which have differing degrees of efficacy. Standard clinically used agents include 
adriamycin, actinomycin D, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracii, cis-platinum, vincristine and 
vinblastine. However, these presently available anti-tumour agents are known to have 
various disadvantages, such as toxicity to healthy cells, and common side effects of anti-tumour 
drugs include alopecia and skin toxicity. The compound 2-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclchexyl]-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone has 
previously been disclosed, for example in European Patent application No. 123,238 which relates to 
2-substituted-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinones of formula (I) 
 
wherein either R1 is hydrogen and R2 is selected from C1-6 alkoxy, aralkoxy, C1-6 alkyl-C1-6 
alkoxy, phenyl substituted by one or two groups selected from halogen and C1-6 
alkyl, halogen and perhalo-C1-6 alkyl or R1 and R2 are both C1-6 alkyl or phenyl, and n 
is zero or 1, and physiologically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds are said to 
have antiprotozoal activity. Specifically, compounds of formula (I) wherein n is zero are  
 
said to be active against the human malaria parasite Plasmodiumfalciparum and also 
against Eimeria species such as E.tenella and E.acervulina, which are causative 
organisms of coccidiosis and compounds of formula (I) where n is 1 are said to be 
active against protozoa of the genus Theileria, in particular T.annulata or T.parva. 
Amongst the compounds specifically named and exemplified is the compound of 
formula (I) wherein n is zero, R1 is hydrogen and R2 is 4-chlorophenyl, i.e. 2-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone. It has now surprisingly been found that 2-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 
represented in this specification by formula (II):- 
 
exhibits activity against tumour cells, more specifically against carcinoma, 
adenocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma cells. Thus, in a first aspect the present invention provides the use of the compound of 
formula (II) and physiologically acceptable salts and other
