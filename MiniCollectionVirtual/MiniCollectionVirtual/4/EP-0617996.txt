<ABSTRACT>
Acid gases are separated from a gas stream by bringing said gas 
stream into contact with a multilayer composite membrane comprising a 

nonselective polymeric support layer and an active separating layer comprising 
a polyelectrolyte polymer which contains cationic groups which are 

electrostatically associated with anions for which the pK
a
 of the conjugate 
acid is greater than 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a membrane-based process for the 
removal of acid gases from gas mixtures containing acid gases and other 
components. Several attempts have been made in the past to develop a suitable 
membrane for the selective separation of acid gas from other gases present 
in a gas stream. U.S. Patent 3,780,496 discloses the use of sulfonated 
poly(xylylene oxide) and metal salts thereof for separating CO₂ from gas 
mixtures. The sulfonated poly(xylylene oxide) material is an ionomer with 
the corresponding membrane exhibiting CO₂ to CH₄ selectivities in the range 
from 28 to 50; however, CO₂ to H₂ selectivities are reported to be less 
than one. U.S. Patent 4,318,714 describes the use of ion exchange membranes for 
the separation of gases. It is stated that selective permeation of acid 
gases occurs by reversible reaction of the gas to be permeated with the 
counterions of the membrane. The membranes are described as being made 
from cross-linked, water insoluble (but water swellable) ion exchange 
polymer materials. Both anionic and cationic ion exchange membranes are 
disclosed. The data described in this patent was also disclosed in an 
article by LeBlanc, et al. J. Memb Sci.6, 339-343 (1980). J. D. Way, et al. AIChE Journal,33, 480-487 (1987) describe the 
permselective properties of Nafion membranes containing monoprotonated 
ethylenediamine (EDAH+) counterions in addition to membranes containing Na+ 
ions. The EDAH+ membrane, unlike the Na+ membrane, exhibits properties 
consistent with permeation of CO₂ by a facilitated transport mechanism and 
CO₂ to CH₄ selectivities of 88 to 550. Additionally, Way, J. D. and Noble, 
R. D., J.Memb. Sci. 46, 309-324 (1989) have also demonstrated the separation 
of CO₂ from H₂S using such membranes; the presence of CO₂ suppresses  
 
the permeation of H₂S and CO₂ permeates preferentially with CO₂ to H₂S 
selectivities of 5.4 to 8.3. U.S. patent 4,758,250 discloses the use of anion exchange poly-electrolyte 
membranes which selectively permeate NH₃ from N₂ containing 
mixtures. As an example is cited the performance of a membrane consisting 
of poly(vinylammonium thiocyanate). NH₃ to N₂ selectivities of greater 
than 1000 are reported along with relatively high NH₃ permeances. Also 
described is the fabrication and testing of an encapsulated or "sandwich" 
membrane in which a layer of anion exchange polyelectrolyte membrane is 
encapsulated between two layers of poly(trimethylsilylpropyne) (PTMSP). 
Such a membrane exhibited an NH₃ to H₂
