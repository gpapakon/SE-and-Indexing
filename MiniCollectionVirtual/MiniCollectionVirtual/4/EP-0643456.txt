<ABSTRACT>
An electrical terminal applicator (10) includes 
an applicator ram (14) drivable by a press ram (60) through 

a working stroke towards, and a return stroke away from, a 
crimping anvil. A first crimping die (20) is mounted on 

the applicator ram for cooperation with the anvil to crimp 
a first portion of an electrical terminal onto an exposed 

end of a conductive core of an insulated electrical wire 
during each working stroke of the applicator ram. A second 

crimping die (18) is mounted on the applicator ram for 
cooperation with the anvil (22) to crimp a second portion 

of the terminal onto the insulation of the electrical wire 
during each working stroke of the applicator ram. A first 

adjusting plate (42) is mounted for rotation about an axis 
(44) on and extending in the direction of movement of the 

applicator ram to selectively interpose projections between 
the press ram and the applicator ram to adjust the shut 

height of the first and second crimping dies. A second 
adjusting plate (46) is mounted for rotation about the axis 

for selectively interposing projections between the first 
adjusting plate and the second crimping die to adjust the 

shut height of the second die. A third adjusting plate 
(50) in the form of a thin flexible disc is mounted for 

rotation about the axis. The disc has a plurality of 
apertures (70) concentric about the axis. A plurality of 

diskettes (54) of a greater thickness than the disc are 
mounted in the apertures. The diskettes have varying 

thicknesses and act as projections selectively positionable 
between the press ram and the first adjusting plate to 

provide further adjustment of the shut height of the first 
die and, in turn, the shut height of the second die.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical terminal applicators and, particularly, to an 
improved crimp height adjustment plate means therefor. A known type of electrical terminal applicator 
includes an applicator ram drivable by a press ram through 
a working stroke towards, and a return stroke away from, a 
crimping anvil. The applicator ram has a first crimping 
die for cooperation with the anvil to crimp a first portion 
of an electrical terminal onto an exposed end of a 
conductive core of an insulated electrical wire during each 
working stroke of the applicator ram. The applicator ram 
has a second crimping die for cooperation with the anvil to 
crimp a second portion of the terminal onto the insulation 
of the electrical wire during each working stroke of the 
applicator ram. The second crimping die is adjustable 
axially of the applicator ram. Plate means are mounted for 
angular adjustment about an axis on, and extending 
lengthwise of, the applicator ram. The plate means 
selectively interpose first projections between the press 
ram and the applicator ram to adjust the shut height of the 
first and second dies, and selectively interpose second 
projections between the applicator ram and the second 
crimping die to independently adjust the shut height of the 
second die. In this known terminal applicator, the plate 
means include two calibrated plates which are independently  
 
angularly adjustable manually about the axis of the 
applicator ram. One of the plates carries the projections 
for adjusting the shut heights of both the first and second 
dies, and the other plate carries the projections for 
adjusting the shut height of the second die. Thus, for 
each position of adjustment of the first die there are a 
plurality of positions of adjustment of the second die. An 
example of this type of known applicator is shown in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,718,160 to Bulanda, dated January 12, 1988. 
An applicator is known in the prior art having three 
stacked, calibrated discs or plates, each being on the 
order of 5mm thick. The upper ring has upwardly directed 
projections to adjust both the insulation and conductor 
crimp heights. The lower ring has downwardly directed 
projections that contact the insulation crimp tooling for 
addition adjustment thereof independent of the conductor 
crimp height. The middle ring also has downwardly directed 
projections that contact that conductor crimp tooling for 
adjustment thereof independent of the insulation crimp 
height. The lower ring is

In an electrical terminal applicator (10) 
which includes an applicator ram (14) drivable by a press 

ram (60) through a working stroke towards, and a return 
stroke away from, a crimping anvil (22,26), 

   a crimping die (18,20) on the applicator ram for 
cooperation with the anvil to crimp a portion of an 

electrical terminal onto an electrical wire during each 
working stroke of the applicator ram, and 

   adjusting plate means (42,46) mounted for angular 
adjustment about an axis (44) on and extending in the 

direction of movement of the applicator ram to selectively 
interpose projection means between the press ram and the 

applicator ram to adjust the shut height of the crimping 
die, 

   characterized in that: 
   a flexible adjusting plate (50) is mounted for 

rotation about said axis to selectively interpose 
projection means (54,98) between the press ram and said 

adjusting plate means to provide further adjustment of the 
shut height of the crimping die. 
In an electrical terminal applicator as set 
forth in claim 1, wherein the flexible plate has a 

plurality of apertures (70) arranged in a circle concentric 
about said axis, and said projection means includes a 

plurality of diskettes (54) of a greater thickness than the 
plate and mounted in the apertures therein, the diskettes 

having varying thicknesses to provide a range of 
adjustments. 
In an electrical terminal applicator as set 
forth in claim 2, wherein said apertures in the flexible 

plate include small tabs (76) projecting radially inwardly 
of the peripheries of the apertures, and each diskette 

includes tab-receiving recess means (84) in the periphery 
thereof whereby the diskettes can be snapped into positions 

in the apertures with the tabs snapping into the recess 
means.
