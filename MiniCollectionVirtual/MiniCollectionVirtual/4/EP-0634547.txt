<ABSTRACT>
In a door locking system of the type having an 
electric or electromagnetic safety mechanism (10), a locking 

lever (6) is made of separate first and second lever 
sections.. The first lever section is fixedly attached 

to a rotary shaft and connected to a lock cylinder (2). The 
second lever section is rotatable on the shaft and 

connected to a locking button (4). The safety mechanism (10) is 
capable of locking the second lever section in the 

locking position thereof. A projection and a recess 
which are engageable with each other, are provided to the 

first and second lever sections such that the first and 
second lever sections are rotatable as one body when the 

first lever section is driven toward the locking position 
thereof or the second lever section is driven toward the 

unlocking position thereof. A torsional spring is 
provided between the first and second lever sections so 

that when the second lever section is in a locked 
condition, only the first lever section can be rotated to 

unlock the locking mechanism, whereas when the second 
lever section is in an unlocked condition, a force for 

operating the first lever section toward the unlocking 
position thereof or a force for operating the second 

lever section toward the locking position thereof can be 
transmitted between the first and second lever section 

for thereby allowing the first and second lever sections 
to rotate as one body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a door
locking system for vehicles and particularly to an
automotive door locking system of the type having an
antitheft deadlocking or safety mechanism.A known door locking system is provided with an
antitheft deadlocking or safety mechanism adapted to hold
a locking lever, which is movable between a locking
position and an unlocking position for locking and
unlocking the locking mechanism, in the locking position
and prevent movement of the locking lever out of the
locking position when when the locking mechanism has been
locked by a lock cylinder which is manually operated from
the outside of the door with a key. Insofar as the
safety mechanism blocks movement of the locking lever out
of the locking position, the locking mechanism cannot be
unlocked by a locking button which is manually operated
from the inside of the door. By this, it is intended to
attain an improved antitheft effect.Figs. 4 and 5 show an example of a prior art door
locking system of the above described kind.In the figures, 1 is a locking mechanism installed
on a door "D". 2 is a lock cylinder disposed adjacent an
outside door handle 3 and adapted to be operated from the
outside of the door "D" with a key. 4 is a locking
button installed on a waist portion of the door "D" in
such a way as to project upward therefrom and adapted to
be operated from the inside of the door "D". 5 is an
inside door handle. 6 is a locking lever fixedly
attached to a locking shaft 7 of the locking mechanism 1 
and movable between a locking position and an unlocking
position for locking and unlocking the locking mechanism
1. The locking lever 6 is connected via pull rods 8 and
9 to the lock cylinder 2 and the locking button 4 so that
the operation of the locking mechanism 1 can be
controlled via the pull rods 8 and 9 by the lock cylinder
2 and the locking button 4. 10 is an antitheft
deadlocking or safety mechanism which is provided with an
electric actuator 11. The actuator 11 has a
reciprocative rod 12 which is movable between an engaging
position and a disengaging position where the rod 12
engages in and disengages from a recessed portion 13 of
the locking lever 6 under drive of a drive means which is
electrically actuated. By the operation of the safety
mechanism 10, the locking lever 10 is selectively locked
and unlocked.The operation of the safety mechanism 10 is
controlled on the basis of a signal from a detector (not
shown) provided to the lock cylinder 2 to detect whether
the lock cylinder 2 is operated

<CLAIMS>
A locking system for a door comprising:

a locking mechanism (1) having a rotary shaft (7) and a
locking lever (6) installed on said shaft for movement

between a locking position and an unlocking position for
causing said locking mechanism to

respectively inhibit and enable opening of the door;
a lock cylinder (2) manually operated from the outside
of the door to lock or unlock said locking mechanism;
a locking button (4) manually operated from the inside
of the door to lock or unlock said locking mechanism;
a safety mechanism (10) electrically or
electromagnetically operated, in response to an operation

of said lock cylinder for locking said locking mechanism,
to lock said locking lever in the locking position

thereof and disable said locking lever from being
unlocked until said locking mechanism is unlocked by the

operation of the lock cylinder;
said locking lever being made up of separate first
and second lever sections, said first lever section (6a) being

connected to said lock cylinder (2) and fixedly attached to
said rotary shaft (7) for rotation together therewith, said

second lever section (6b) being connected to said locking
button (4) and rotatable on said rotary shaft (7), said second

lever section being capable of being locked in a position
corresponding to the locking position of said locking

lever by a locking operation of said safety mechanism (10);
engagement means (20) for interconnecting said first
and second lever sections and allowing the same to rotate

as one body when said locking button is operated to drive
said second lever section (6b) toward a position corresponding

to the unlocking position of said locking lever or when
said lock cylinder is operated to drive said first lever 

section (6a) toward a position corresponding to the locking
position of said locking lever; and
