<ABSTRACT>
An inductive sensor (11) with an electric coil (14) cooperates with a rotating, magnetoconductive part to emit electric signals. The contact area (18) between the ends of the windings of the coil (14) and the busbars (15) is covered with a silicone mass (26) and with a strip (27) of a polyimide material towards the injection moulded housing (10). Thermal change cycles may be increased up to fourfold without damaging the wire of which the coil (14) is made. The durability of the inductive sensor is thus improved.

<CLAIMS>
Inductive sensor (11), in particular a rotation
speed sensor, having a housing (10) which is

composed of an injection-moulded compound and in
which a coil former (13) having at least one coil

(14) and busbars (15) is located, to which busbars
(15) the ends of the windings of the coil (14) are

attached, and with the region in which contact is
made between the windings of the coil (14) and the

respective busbar (15) being surrounded by a
permanently elastic material (26) and, at least

towards the housing (10) that is produced by
extrusion coating, by a body (27) composed of

temperature-resistant material.
