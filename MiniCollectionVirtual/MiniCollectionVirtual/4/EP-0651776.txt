<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of purifying solid hydrophobic substances in the presence of water to form a granulate material by treating the solid substances, under warm conditions, optionally several times, with one or more different two-phase systems comprising (A) a phase which wets the solid substances and causes the granulate material to form and which consists essentially of one or more organic liquids which are immiscible or only partially miscible with water and (B) a phase which takes up the impurities and which consists essentially of (B1) water, one or more organic liquids miscible with water and, optionally, an inorganic acid or base or (B2) water and an inorganic acid. The granulate material thus formed is subsequently separated from the aqueous phase.
