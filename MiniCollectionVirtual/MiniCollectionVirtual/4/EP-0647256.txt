<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to adhesive articles having positionable
and repositionable bonding properties and in particular to adhesive articles
having at least one microstructured adhesive surface.Pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) sheets, films and tapes are often
difficult to apply to a substrate in a precise location and without air
entrapment, primarily due to preadhesion or "quick stick" behavior of the
PSA. This is particularly true for "aggressive" PSAs that have high bond
strengths and/or low temperature tack properties. Several methods and
configurations have been developed to make application of PSA films and
tapes easier.For example, application aids such as detergent and water are
commonly used to eliminate preadhesion. Formulations vary, but typically
include water, a surfactant or lubricant, and a solvent (generally an alcohol)
that speeds bond formation and drying. The liquids tend to form a film
between the adhesive and substrate, thus preventing contact and preadhesion.
Unfortunately, the liquid is difficult to remove and removal of the liquid is
seldom complete. Additionally, most application aids affect the adhesive
properties and prevent rapid formation of a strong bond between adhesive and
substrate. The application aids may also mar or stain substrate surfaces.Dry application aids, such as particles, powders or talcs are also useful
in preventing preadhesion (See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,376,151 and
4,556,595). While these techniques make application very easy and provide
for easy positioning and repositioning, formation of a strong adhesive bond to
the substrate is slow, typically requiring contact of 1 to 7 days. Discontinuous coatings of nontacky materials projecting from the
adhesive surface have also been used to prevent preadhesion of the PSA
during application. Although these articles can be placed against a substrate
and freely moved over the substrate surface, the articles lack any means for
weakly and temporarily bonding the adhesive to the substrate prior to
permanently bonding the article to the substrate. These adhesive films and
tapes have no adhesion when placed lightly against the substrate surface.
Such coatings include patterned polymer coatings, particles, and films (See,
e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,554,835; 4,023,570; 4,054,697; 4,151,319; and
U.K. Patent No. 1,541,311).CONTROLTAC brand adhesives use a random distribution of hollow
glass microspheres partially embedded in the adhesive as a means to prevent
contact and preadhesion (See U.S. Patent No. 3,331,279).
