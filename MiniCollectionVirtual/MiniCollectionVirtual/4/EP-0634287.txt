<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording sheet 
and a process for its production. In recent years, along with wide spread use of 
electron still cameras or computers, technology for hard 
copies has rapidly been developed to record the images on 
paper sheets or the like. The ultimate goal of such hard 
copies is silver halide photography, and especially, it 
is an object of the development to bring the color 
reproduction, image density, gloss, weather resistance, 
etc. as close as those of silver halide photography. For 
the recording system of hard copies, not only a method of 
directly photographing a display on which an image is 
shown by silver halide photography, but also various 
systems such as a sublimation type thermal transfer 
system, an ink jet system and an electrostatic transfer 
system, are known. Ink jet printers have been widely used in recent 
years, since full coloring is thereby easy, and printing  
 
noise is little. The ink jet system is designed to eject 
ink droplets from nozzles at a high speed to the 
recording sheet, and the ink contains a large amount of a 
solvent. Therefore, the recording sheet for an ink jet 
printer is required to quickly absorb the ink and yet 
have an excellent color-forming property. For example, a 
recording sheet is known which has a porous layer of 
alumina hydrate formed on a substrate (US-A-5,104,730 and 
EP-A-524626A). However, when the porous layer of alumina hydrate 
provided on a substrate is in contact with something 
sharp, it is susceptible to scratching. It is an object 
of the present invention to provide a recording sheet 
excellent in scratch resistance. The present invention provides a recording sheet 
comprising a substrate, a porous layer of pseudo-boehmite 
having a thickness of from 10 to 100 µm formed on the 
substrate and a layer of silica gel having a thickness of 
from 0.1 to 30 µm formed on the porous layer of pseudo-boehmite. Now, the present invention will be described in 
detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. The porous layer of pseudo-boehmite is preferably a 
colloidal aggregate of boehmite crystals (Al2O3·nH2O, n = 
1 to 1.5). It preferably contains an organic binder 
component. In the recording sheet, the boehmite crystals 
are preferably orientated so that the b axis is vertical  
 
to the sheet surface, whereby high absorptivity and 
transparency will be imparted. The porous layer of pseudo-boehmite preferably has a 
porous structure consisting essentially of pores with a 
radius of from 1 to 15 nm
