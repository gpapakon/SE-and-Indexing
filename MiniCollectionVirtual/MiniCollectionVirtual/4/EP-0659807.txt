<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to organosiloxane compounds 
containing ionically charged inorganic metal oxide complexes 
referred to as polyoxometalates. More particularly, this 
invention relates to organosiloxane compounds containing 
covalent bonds to the oxygen atoms of polyoxometalate (POM) 
structures. The chemical literature describes a class of 
ionically charged water-soluble oxides derived from 
polyvalent metals such as molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium. 
Oxides of this type are referred to in the literature as 
"isopoly anions" or "isopoly complexes" and are represented 
by the formula (M'mOy)p. Anionic heteropoly complexes 
contain an additional metallic or non-metallic element such 
as hydrogen, phosphorus and silicon and have been 
represented by the formula (XxMmOy)q. In the foregoing formulae, M' is a polyvalent 
metal, M is molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, niobium or 
tantalum, X represents a "hetero" atom, i.e the additional 
non-metallic or metallic element, m, x and y are integers 
and p and q represent the charge on the complex. This 
charge can be calculated by adding the products obtained by 
multiplying the valences of X, M and O by the value of the 
integer m, x or y associated with that atom. The values of 
p and q are negative except when M' is aluminum or gallium. 
The literature reports that X can be any of at least 65 
metallic or non-metallic elements. A thorough discussion of POMs is contained in a 
text by M.T. Pope entitled "Heteropoly and Isopoly 
Oxometalates" published in 1983 by Springer Verlag. When 
the values of p and q in the foregoing formulae are  
 
negative, the oxometalate anions are associated with cations 
that are typically hydrogen, alkali metals, alkaline earth 
metals, NH4+ or R4N+, where R represents a monovalent 
hydrocarbon radical. The type of anion will affect the 
chemical and physical properties of the POM, including 
solubility, and the properties of the POM materials. While there are a very large number of known POMs, 
investigators have found that most are characterized by 
relatively few structures. These structures consist of 
groups of MO6 octahedra and XO4 tetrahedra that share edges, 
corners, and, occasionally, faces with adjacent polyhedra. The structure of the heteropolyacid H3PW12O40Â·6H2O, 
was described by J.F. Keggin, Nature, 1933, 131, p. 908, as 
a cluster of edge-shared polyhedra and his name has been 
given to the polyhedron type of POM structures. The structures of a number of POMs are discussed 
in the aforementioned text by Pope;
