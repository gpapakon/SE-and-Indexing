<ABSTRACT>
There is described a polymerization apparatus for the 
polymerization of a polymerizable monomer, which is equipped 

with a circulation path for the flow of a reaction mixture 
that comprises a polymerization vessel (1), a heat exchanger 

(2) arranged outside said polymerization vessel (1), and a 
pipeline (3) that is extended from said polymerization vessel 

(1), is returned to said polymerization vessel (1) through 
said heat exchanger (2), and is provided with a strainer (5) 

in the course thereof. Said apparatus is characterized by the 
surface of a filter being provided in said strainer (5) and 

having located upstream rodlike projections, and a method of 
polymerizing a monomer to a polymer by using said apparatus. 

With this apparatus scale and polymers in the form of blocks 
can be prevented from being mixed into the reaction mixture. 

Therefore, if the polymerization is repeated, clogging of the 
tubes of the heat exchanger and dropping of the flow velocity 

of the reaction mixture as well as fish eyes on sheets made 
from said polymer can be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymerization apparatus 
for polymerizing a monomer having an ethylenically 
unsaturated double bond, that carries out the polymerization 
while the reaction mixture is circulated through a heat 
exchanger that is arranged separately from the polymerization 
vessel. Polymerization of a monomer having an ethylenically 
unsaturated double bond is carried out in such a manner that 
a polymerization medium, such as water, a dispersant, a 
polymerization initiator, the monomer having an ethylenically 
unsaturated double bond, and, if required, other various 
additives are charged into a polymerization vessel equipped 
with a jacket and a reflux condenser, then the inside 
temperature of the polymerization vessel is elevated, and the 
polymerization reaction is carried out while the temperature 
is kept at a constant temperature. To keep the inside of the 
polymerization vessel at a constant temperature during that 
polymerization reaction, since it is required to remove the 
heat of the polymerization reaction, cooling water is 
circulated through the jacket and the reflux condenser. In recent years, in order to improve the productivity, the 
polymerization was carried out (1) with a large 
polymerization vessel and (2) with a shortened polymerization 
time per batch. However, if the polymerization vessel is 
large, the rate of the heat transfer area to the reaction 
mixture per unit volume is decreased, and therefore the 
above-mentioned conventional method of removing the heat of 
polymerization reaction is insufficient for the heat removing 
capacity. Further, if the polymerization time per batch is 
shortened, the exotherm rate of the polymerization reaction  
 
per unit time increases, and therefore the heat removing 
capacity becomes further insufficient. To overcome this disadvantage, several methods are suggested 
and, among them, an effective method includes a method 
wherein a reaction mixture is circulated through a heat 
exchanger arranged outside the polymerization vessel (see 
Japanese Pre-examination Patent Publication (kokai) Nos. 
24991/1979, 47410/1981, and 32606/1983 and Japanese Patent 
Publication (kokoku) No. 11642/1989). This method is quite 
effective in that the rate of the heat transfer area to the 
reaction mixture per unit volume can be made large. However, this method has a problem in view of the operation 
and the product quality, namely the tubes of the heat 
exchanger are clogged with polymer scale or polymers in the 
form of blocks produced
