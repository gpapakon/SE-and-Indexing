<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with edible plastic 
dispersions based on rapid gel setting starches with 
particular rheological properties. Edible dispersions with a plastic rheology usually have a 
high fat content. Often the fat is present as a continuous 
fat phase. Well-known edible, plastic dispersions are, for 
example, butter and margarine. Many attempts have been made to find a replacement for fat 
in edible products. One reason why such a fat replacer is 
desirable is the wish to reduce the caloric content of the 
food product and other dietetic considerations while at the 
same time lower production cost, in particular by reducing 
raw material cost. If both goals are achieved a resulting 
product must still have consumer acceptable flavor, 
mouthfeel and long shelf life. One proposal as a fat substitute has been the use of a 
non-caloric gaseous or solid material such as air or silica. 
Other proposed fat replacers include substances that are 
physically similar to triglycerides but that cannot be 
digested by the human body, such as waxes, e.g., jojoba oil, 
and sucrose poly fatty acid esters. See, for example, JAOCS 
63(3) (March 1986), 278-288. The results of these 
approaches have thus far been less than satisfactory. One 
of the problems with the indigestible physical analogues of 
triglyceride fat is that the material is only available in 
limited quantities, and the material cost is high. The  
 
gaseous and solid materials referred to above can be used to 
replace only a small part of the fat. At higher inclusion 
levels these fat extenders severely affect the properties of 
the resulting product. A substance that has been widely applied as a fat extender 
is water. This use of water has, for example, led to the 
introduction of the so-called halvarines: a substitute for 
butter and margarine containing only about 40% instead of 
the usual 80-85% fat. However, as with air, for example, 
water can also be employed only to a limited extent before 
adverse effects on the product properties are observed. To 
overcome this disadvantage it has been suggested that water 
should be used in combination with thickening agents, and in 
particular with gelling agents. This approach has led to 
substantial improvements of such products with substantially 
reduced fat content like halvarine. However, with these approaches it has been possible to 
replace only part of the fat of edible plastic dispersions. 
When only thickening agents are employed in combination with 
the water, a still
