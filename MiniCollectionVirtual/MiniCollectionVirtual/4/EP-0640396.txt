<ABSTRACT>
To facilitate manipulation of the impact bar of an impact crusher, the impact bars (20) are, together with their clamping wedges (22), inserted only loosely into the impact bar receptacles (14), in which they are displaced from an unlocking position close to the axis into a wedging position distant from the axis only under the action of the centrifugal force which begins on starting of the rotor (10).

Impact crusher with a rotor (10) which has beating
arms (20) which are affixed by one or more chucking wedges

(22) in beating arm locators (14) of the rotor, the
associated chucking wedge or wedges being arranged in the

beating arm locator of the rotor in an approximately
radially displaceable manner under the action of the

centrifugal force between a release position near to the
rotation axis (12) and a chucking position remote from the

axis, wherein in the release position the distance of the
centre of gravity of the beating arm from the rotation

axis is greater than the centre-to-centre distance of the
centre of gravity of the associated chucking wedge and

wherein the radial external opening (16) in the beating
arm locator is constricted by a part (18) which fits over

the latter and against which the beating arm rests by a
protruding abutment lug (24) in the chucking position,


characterised in that
 the portion of the chucking wedge
(22) that bears against the beating arm (20) features a

cuneiform slope situated outside the automatic interlock,
that the radial external opening (16) in the beating arm

locator (14) is constricted by a further part (26) which
fits tangentially over it, a part (18) affixed to the

rotor (10) and in the form of a contact beam fitting over
the external opening (16) from one side and a part (26)

affixed in a detachable manner to the rotor (10) and in
the form of a limiting plate fitting over the external

opening (16) from the opposite side and also over the
chucking wedge (22), and that the beating arm (20) has two

abutment lugs (24) which protrude beyond both the radial
surfaces thereof, one abutment lug (24) resting in the

release position on the upper face of the part (26)
configured as the limiting plate and the other abutment

lug resting in the chucking position against the underside
of the part (18) configured as the supporting beam. 
Impact crusher according to claim 1, characterised in
that the part (26) which is configured as the limiting

plate is adapted to be displaced by means of a slotted
joint (28, 30) between the operating position and a

position that does not fit over the external opening (16)
in the beating arm locator (14).
Impact crusher according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that on its upper face the part (26)

configured as the limiting plate incorporates a recessed
area (32) for the abutment lug (24).
