<ABSTRACT>
A combination bearing construction capable 
of withstanding high-speed rotation and having a high 

accuracy of rotation is provided. The combination 
bearing construction comprises a first bearing means, 

a second bearing means, a third bearing means and 
a fourth bearing means. The first bearing means 

bears impulsive forces in a radial direction, which 
impulsive forces are exerted on a rotary body during 

rotation, and comprises an inner race (1) and an 
outer ring (2) which are formed of a silicon nitride 

based ceramic sintered body. The second bearing 
means bears a load in an axial direction with a 

predetermined gap maintained between it and the 
rotary body, which load is exerted on the rotary 

body, and is constituted by a magnetic bearing body 
which comprises two permanent magnets (12, 13) 

opposing each other in a thrust direction. The third 
bearing means serves to maintain an accuracy of 

rotation in a radial direction of the rotary body, and 
comprises radial dynamic pressure generating grooves 

(5) formed on a cylindrical surface of the inner race 
(1). The fourth bearing means serves to maintain an 

accuracy of rotation in a thrust direction of the rotary 
body, and comprises an air reservoir (100) confined 

in a semi-closed condition by the inner race (1), outer 
ring (2) and a cover (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a bearing
structure, and more specifically, it relates to a
composite bearing structure, having a prescribed load, for
supporting a rotator rotating at a high speed.With increase in storage capacity and reduction in
access time of a hard disk driver (hereinafter referred to
as "HDD"), a high rotational speed and high rotational
accuracy corresponding thereto are required for a spindle
motor for driving the HDD in recent years. In a sliding
part of this rotating apparatus, a ball bearing has
generally been employed for a bearing part, for example.
So far as a conventional ball bearing has been employed,
however, the upper withstandable rotational speed has been
about 10000 r.p.m., due to a problem of seizure or wear.In order to drive a precision motor requiring such a
high rotational speed and high rotational accuracy at a
higher speed, there has been proposed employment of an air
bearing (dynamic pressure gas bearing) of ceramics such as
SiC or Si3N4 for a rotary sliding part. When a rotator is
driven in a rotating apparatus employing such an air
bearing, air is forcibly introduced at least into a 
clearance between a radial bearing body or a thrust
bearing body and the rotator through a groove. Thus, the
air pressure in the clearance is increased and the rotator
is driven at a high speed through an air bearing which is
provided between the respective members. In order to
implement high-speed rotation in such a manner, rotational
accuracy during high-speed rotation is maintained by the
air bearing, and a thrust-directional load which is
applied to the rotator is supported by the air bearing.
Further, the aforementioned radial bearing body and the
rotator can withstand sliding between the respective
members in a low-speed area in starting/stopping of the
rotator since the same are formed by ceramics materials
respectively.When a conventional radial bearing body which is
formed by ceramics such as Si3N4 is employed in high-speed
rotation exceeding 5000 r.p.m., however, an impactive
knock wear phenomenon is caused by contact between bearing
members. Namely, sliding between the respective members
is caused in a high-speed area when abrupt radial impact
force is applied to the rotator in high-speed rotation.
It has been difficult for a conventional ceramics sintered
body to withstand the high-speed sliding. Even if a
radial bearing body or a thrust bearing body has been
formed by an air bearing body consisting of a ceramics 
sintered body as described above,
