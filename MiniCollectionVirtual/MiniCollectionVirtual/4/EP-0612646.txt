<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hinge for the articulated connection of vehicle sections (1 and 2) of an articulated rail vehicle with the aid of a roller bearing (3) which is held on a support carrier (2a) which projects beyond the end of one of the vehicle sections (2) and interacts in an articulated fashion with a support carrier (1a) which projects beyond the end of another vehicle section (1) and permits horizontal and vertical deflection movements of the vehicle sections (1 and 2) with respect to one another. The objective of the invention is to construct the hinge in such a way that the roller bearing is relieved of wear-promoting stresses and larger horizontal bending angles can be realised between the connected vehicle sections. This objective is achieved in that the support carrier (2a) of the second vehicle section 2 is secured to the inner ring (3a) of the roller bearing (3) by means of an elastomer joint (4), which roller bearing (3) has neither radial nor axial play at least in the installation state.

Articulated connection for articulated connection of 
vehicle parts (1 and 2) of a multi-element rail vehicle 

with the aid of a roller bearing (3) which is mounted on 
a supporting carrier (2a) projecting beyond the end of 

one of the vehicle parts (2) and cooperates in 
articulated fashion with a supporting carrier (1a) 

projecting beyond the end of another vehicle part (1) and 
allows horizontal and vertical deflecting movements of 

the vehicle parts (1 and 2) relative to one another, 
wherein the supporting carrier (2a) of the second vehicle 

part (2) is locked to the inner ring (3a) of the roller 
bearing (3) by means of an elastomer joint (4), 

characterised in that at least in the installed state the 
roller bearing (3) exhibits neither radial nor axial 

play, in that the elastomer joint (4) is disposed in the 
space surrounded by the inner ring (3a) so that in the 

vertical extension it extends at least essentially as far 
as the vertical plane of the roller bearing (3) and in 

that the elastomer joint (4) exhibits a rigid inner body 
(4a) with a centering bore (4d) and with a centering face 

(4e) for a centering pin (7) fixed on the supporting 
carrier (2a), a rigid outer body (4b) with a supporting 

face (4f) for the inner ring (3a) of the roller bearing 
(3), and an elastomer layer (4c) disposed between the 

inner and outer bodies (4a and 4b). 
Articulated connection according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the outer radius of the inner body 

(4a) in the vertical extension of the inner body (4a) is 
such that it increases and decreases according to a 

predetermined mathematical function and the inner radius 
of the outer body (4b) is such that it decreases and 

increases in the same way in the vertical extension of  
 

the outer body (4b). 
Articulated connection according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the spring stiffness of the 

elastomer joint (4) at least with small deflections of 
the inner and outer bodies (6a and 6b) relative to one 

another out of the vertical in the longitudinal and 
transverse directions is approximately constant. 
Articulated connection according to at least one of 
the preceding claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 

roller bearing (3) is a four-point bearing with a divided 
inner ring (3a). 
Articulated connection according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the inner ring (3a) of the roller 

bearing (3) is locked to the supporting face (4f) of the 
outer body (4b) of the elastomer joint (4) by means of a 

clamping ring (5) and clamping screws (5a) and in that 
the outer ring (3b) of the roller bearing (3) is locked 

to the supporting carrier (2a) of the vehicle part (2) by 
means of a second clamping ring (6) and clamping screws 

(6a). 
Articulated connection according to one or more of 
the preceding claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a 

centering pin (7) is fixed to the supporting carrier 
(2a), which pin engages in the centering bore (4d) from 

one side and on the opposite side is locked to the inner 
body (4a) of the elastomer joint (4) by means of a 

centering ring (8) and a detachable fixing means (necked-down 
screw 9). 
Articulated connection according to one or more of 
the preceding claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 

supporting carrier (2a) of the vehicle part (2) engages 
from above with the associated centering pin (7) in the 

centering bore (4d) and the supporting carrier (2a) is 
supported on the inner body (4a) of the elastomer joint  

 
(4) by means of the centering pin (7). 
Articulated connection according to one or more of 
the preceding claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the 

vehicle part (2) is an end vehicle part.
