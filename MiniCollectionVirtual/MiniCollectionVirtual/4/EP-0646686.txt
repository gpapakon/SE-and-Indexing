<ABSTRACT>
There is a process in which an additional steel reinforcement 10 is embedded on the concrete building element 1 using concrete composition 12. In this arrangement, it is desired to enhance the strengthening, and increase the increase in the load-bearing strength of the concrete building element, which can be achieved by the additional reinforcement. This is achieved in that a groove 3 which exhibits a groove base 6 and two groove walls 7 and is intended for receiving the additional steel reinforcement 10 is produced in the reinforced 2 concrete building element 1 by means of the high-pressure water jet, a reinforcement region 9 being left free in the process, and in that the additional steel reinforcement 10 and the embedding concrete composition 12 are introduced into the groove 5, the concrete composition 12 being brought into contact with the groove base 6 and the groove walls 7. The additional reinforcement is introduced into the interior of the concrete building element and that surface of the concrete building element which is in contact with the additional concrete composition is enlarged.

A method for additionally reinforcing a reinforced
concrete structural component (1) of a structure to be

renovated while the structure and the concrete structural
component are in continuous use,


in which a groove (5) having a groove base (6) and two groove
walls (7) is created in the reinforced concrete structural

component (1) by means of a high-pressure water jet in order
to accommodate an additional reinforcing steel reinforcement

(10), exposing a reinforcement region (9),
in which the reinforcing steel is provided with a rough
surface and the additional reinforcing steel reinforcement

(10) is introduced into the groove (5) and fixed at a distance
from the groove base (6) by means of binding wire (11), and
in which concrete material (12) is sprayed from underneath or
from the side into the groove (5), the concrete material

embedding the additional reinforcing steel reinforcement (10)
and being brought into contact with the groove base (6) and

also the groove walls (7).
A method according to claim 1, in which the reinforcement
of the concrete structural component has two adjacent

longitudinal reinforcing members, characterised in that the
groove (5) is created such that it extends between the two

adjacent longitudinal reinforcing members and is spaced
therefrom substantially over its length.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, in which the
reinforcement of the concrete structural component has

reinforcing stirrups which extend transversely, characterised
in that the groove (5) is created such that it and the

reinforcing stirrups (4) cross one another.
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that the
groove (5) is created such that the groove base (6) is deeper 

than the exposed regions of the reinforcing stirrups (4) and
in that the additional reinforcing steel reinforcement (10) is

inserted between the groove base and the reinforcing stirrups.
A method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that before the groove (5) is created, the

position of longitudinal reinforcing members adjacent the
planned groove is determined and marked on the concrete

structural component.
A method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the groove (5) is created such that it

has a trapezoidal cross-section with the narrower side on the
groove base.
A method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it is used with a concrete structural

component (1) which is the supporting structure of a bridge.
