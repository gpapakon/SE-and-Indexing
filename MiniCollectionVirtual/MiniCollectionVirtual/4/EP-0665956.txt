<DESCRIPTION>
 REAL TIME MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANALYSIS WITH NON-LINEAR REGRESSION MEANSCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is closely related to the U.S. Patent 5,015,954 issued on 14 May 1991 to Dechene et al., and to U.S. Patent 5,049,819 issued Sept. 17, 1991 to Dechene et al., both entitled "MagneticResonance Analysis in Real Time, Industrial Usage Mode"; and to U.S. Patent Application 07/794,931 filed Nov. 20, 1991 entitled "Improved Magnetic Resonance Analysis in Real Time, Industrial Usage Mode"; and to U.S. Patent Application 07/885,633 filed May 19, 1992 entitled "NMR Analysis of Polypropylene in Real Time". All of these patents and patent applications are of common assignment with this application, and the disclosures of all are hereby incorporated herein by reference, as though set out at length herein.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the analytic means relating a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) free induction decay (FID) curve to the physical quantities of the target nuclei in the samples under 

 test. More particularly, the present invention relates to regression means that provides correlation between the function equations derived from the FID and the types, properties and quantities of target nuclei in the sample under test.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPulsed NMR techniques are used in instruments for the measurement of the type, property and quantity of lattice bound and free, magnetically active nuclei within a sample. Some of the substances and properties that have been measured by NMR techniques are: moisture, polymers and copolymers, oils, fats and crystalline materials.Pulsed NMR uses a burst or pulse of energy that is designed to excite the nuclei of a particular nuclear species of a sample being measured (the protons, or the like, of such sample having first been precessed in an essentially static magnetic field); in other words the precession is modified by the pulse. After the application of the pulse there occurs a free induction decay (FID) of the magnetization associated with the excited nuclei. That is, the transverse magnetization associated with the excited nuclei relaxes back to its equilibrium value of zero. This relaxation produces a changing magnetic field which is measured in adjacent pickup coils. A representation of this relaxation is the FID curve. The analysis method described herein and in the above related patents and applications is to decompose the FID waveform into a group of separate time function equations. The coefficients of
