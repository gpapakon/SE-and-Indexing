<ABSTRACT>
A flap 10 has a first portion 11 flexibly connected to 
a lid 2 and a second portion 13 connected to the first 

portion 11 by an integral flexible hinge strip 14. The 
second portion also 13 carries pivot pins 15 which locate 

into an upstanding rim 16 of the lid portion 2. These pivot 
pins are slightly offset vertically and horizontally from 

the flexible hinge 14 thus enabling the flap 10 to be 
toggled between two stable conditions. In the first of 

these the hinge 14 is snapped to a position above the pivot 
pins 15 thus pressing the second flap portion 13 positively 

down into the opening 6. If pressure is applied to the 
first portion 11 the flexible hinge 14 will be forced down 

past and below the pivot pins 15 thus causing the second 
flap portion 13 to flip upwardly into the alternative stable 

condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with devices for creating 
a secure closure to an opening in a container. A closure 
device in the form of a simple lid with a central hinge, 
which is pivotally connected at one edge to the top face of 
a cap for a container is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4223814. 
One half of the lid can be pressed into a recess so that the 
other half lifts above the central hinge to expose openings 
in the top of the cap. The hinging arrangement is very 
simple and uncontrolled. For the present invention the 
container may, for example, be one which is intended to hold 
sharps (hypodermic needles and the like) and surgical and 
medical waste. The closing of such a container needs to be 
very positive and not susceptible to accidental opening. 
The closure arrangement of U.S. Patent 4223814 is 
unsatisfactory for this purpose as there is no positive 
closure and accidental opening is very possible. According to the present invention there is provided a 
container closure device for an opening defined by a rim of 
a lid portion of a container, and comprising a flap flexibly 
connected at one end to the lid portion and having first and 
second portions respectively on opposite sides of a hinge 
which is located on the lid portion, wherein the first flap 
portion is nearest said flexible connection and forms an 
actuating member for the hinge, and the second flap portion 
is furthest from said flexible connection and is positioned 
to close off said opening when the hinge is in one  
 
condition, and is positioned fully to reveal said opening 
when the hinge is in an alternative condition, characterised 
in that the hinge is a snap action hinge which has two 
stable conditions, and comprises a pivot connection defined 
by pins on the lid portion locating into holes in said rim, 
and a flexible hinge across said first flap portion, the 
flexible hinge being located close to the pivot connection 
but along a line which is displaced away from the axis of 
the pivot connection towards said flexible connection, and 
is also displaced above said axis when the hinge is in said 
first condition but below said axis when the hinge is in 
said second condition. With such an arrangement the snap action hinge will 
hold the second flap portion securely in place over the 
opening in the lid portion until such time as suitable 
positive pressure is applied to the first flap portion to 
toggle it into its other stable condition. Ideally the 
flexible connection and the flexible hinge are integrally 
moulded

<CLAIMS>
A container closure device for an opening (6) 
defined by a rim (16) of a lid portion (2) of a container 

(1), and comprising a flap (10) flexibly connected at one 
end to the lid portion and having first (11) and second (13) 

portions respectively on opposite sides of a hinge (14) 
which is located on the lid portion, wherein the first flap 

portion (11) is nearest said flexible connection (12) and 
forms an actuating member for the hinge, and the second flap 

portion (13) is furthest from said flexible connection and 
is positioned to close off said opening when the hinge is in 

a first condition, and is positioned fully to reveal said 
opening when the hinge is in a second condition, 

characterised in that the hinge is a snap action hinge which 
has two stable conditions, and comprises a pivot connection 

defined by pins (15) on the lid portion locating into holes 
in said rim, and a flexible hinge (14) across said first 

flap portion, the flexible hinge being located close to the 
pivot connection (15) but along a line which is displaced 

away from the axis of the pivot connection (15) towards said 
flexible connection, and is also displaced above said axis 

when the hinge is in said first condition but below said 
axis when the hinge is in said second condition. 
A device according to Claim 1, wherein a recessed 
part (19) of the lid portion receives the first flap 

portion.  
 
A device according to Claim 2, wherein the underside 
of the first flap portion within said recessed part 

carries ribs (18) which angle down from the flexible hinge 
into the recess towards said flexible connection. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
including a locking device (21) operable to prevent 

operation of said snap action hinge. 
A device according to Claim 4, wherein the locking 
device comprises at least one tab (21) which is adjustable 

from a non-interfering position to lie in a locking position 
below said first flap portion (11) near to said flexible 

hinge so as to restrict any downward pivoting movement of 
the first flap portion. 
A device according to Claim 5, wherein the tab in 
its locking position engages a holding formation (22,23) on 

the lid portion and/or said first flap portion for resisting 
return movement of the tab. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
wherein the opening is at the mouth of a chute (7) leading 

down into the container clear of the container walls. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
wherein the flexible connection and the flexible hinge are 

integrally moulded thinner portions of a moulded plastics 
flap and lid portion combination. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
wherein the underside of said second flap portion carries a 

resilient sealing pad (25) for sealing engagement over the 
opening in the lid portion.  

 
A device according to any one of Claim 1 to 9, 
wherein the lid portion has an upstanding rim (16) around 

the whole of the flap when the flap closes.
