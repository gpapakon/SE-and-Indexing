<ABSTRACT>
New monoclonal antibodies (MAb), specific for proteins of the laminin family and the laminin P1 fragment (I) produced by pepsin digestion of human placenta, pref. bind to the native folded structure of P1 domain and have affinity for intact native laminin about the same as for (I). Also new are hybridomas that produce MAb.

<CLAIMS>
A monoclonal antibody having specificity for proteins from the family of the laminins and the laminin P1 fragment which can be prepared from human placenta by pepsin digestion, wherein the monoclonal antibody preferably binds to the structures of the laminin P1 domain of laminin which are folded in the native manner, the affinity of the antibody for intact, native laminin is approximately equal to the affinity of the antibody for the laminin P1 fragment and the antibody has the properties of a monoclonal antibody which is produced by the hybridoma cell line DSM ACC2181 DSM ACC2180 or DSM ACC2182.
A monoclonal antibody as claimed in claim 1, wherein the antibody is formed by a hybridoma which arose by fusing cells from a myeloma cell line and lymphocytes from a non-human vertebrate, which had previously been immunized with Laminin P1, and was subsequently selected, and wherein the antibody which is formed also exhibits, in addition to good binding affinity for purified human laminin from placenta, a good reaction with the high molecular weight form of the laminin isolated from human serum.
A monoclonal antibody as claimed in one of claims 1 to 2, which has the ability to bind to the antigen
 as a pair together with an additional antibody as claimed in claim 1 or 2.
A monoclonal antibody as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, which is assigned to the IgG 2a subclass.
A monoclonal antibody as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, which is assigned to the IgG 1 subclass.
A hybridoma cell line which produces an antibody as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3 and which can be prepared by fusing cells from a myeloma cell line and lymphocytes from a non-human vertebrate, which has previously been immunized with laminin P1, and subsequently selecting the hybrids on the basis of whether the antibody produced by the hybrid also exhibits, in addition to good binding affinity for purified human laminin from placenta, a good reaction with the high molecular weight form of the laminin isolated from human serum.
A hybridoma cell line as claimed in claim 6, wherein the lymphocytes are removed from mice of the Balb/c strain which have been immunized with laminin P1 and the myeloma cell line is the mouse myeloma cell line P3X63AG8.653.
The hybridoma cell line DSM ACC2181.
The hybridoma cell line DSM ACC2180.
The hybridoma cell line DSM ACC2182.
A process for preparing a monoclonal antibody as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein

a) non-human vertebrates are immunized with the laminin P1 fragment which can be prepared from human placenta by pepsin digestion,
b) lymphocytes are isolated from the immunized vertebrates and fused with myeloma cells,
c) the hybrids are selected with regard to the presence of an antibody having the properties given in claims 1 to 3 and cloned, and
d) the antibody is isolated from these clones.
The process as claimed in claim 11, wherein the hybridoma cell lines DSM ACC2181, DSM ACC2180 or DSM ACC2182 are employed for carrying out process step d) in claim 11.
A method for the immunological determination of native laminin using a coating antibody, which is bound adhesively or covalently to a support material, and a labeled second antibody which recognizes the antigen bound to the coating antibody, wherein the coating antibody is a monoclonal antibody as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5.
A method for the immunological determination of native laminin using a coating antibody, which is bound adhesively or covalently to a support material, and a labeled second antibody which recognizes the antigen bound to the coating antibody, wherein the labeled second antibody is a monoclonal antibody as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5.
The method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the coating antibody is a monoclonal antibody as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5.
The method as claimed in claim 14 or 15, wherein the coating antibody is a monoclonal antibody, which is produced by the hybridoma cell line DSM ACC2181.
