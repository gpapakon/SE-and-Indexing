<ABSTRACT>
The sports shoe comprises an upper (11) equipped with an opening (11a), to permit the passage of the foot, and including an inner quarter (12) and an outer quarter (13) which are linked together by means of a lace or cable (15) in conjunction with a blocking device or blocker (20) along a specific alternating path around a return or loops (1 to 8) arranged on both sides of the said opening (11a). According to the invention, the ends of the strands (15a, 15b) forming the lace (15) are secured to two fixed anchoring points (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) produced in a lower end zone of the lacing located towards the front (AV) of the shoe, the said strands (15a, 15b) together forming, at their opposite end, a free loop (21) capable of constituting a single gripping element for exerting traction according to a force (F) distributed symmetrically over each of the strands (15a, 15b) from the two fixed points.

Sport boot comprising an external sole (10) on which is mounted an upper (11)
provided with an opening (11a), to allow the passage of the foot, and comprising a closing system

(14), constituted by a lace or cable (15) forming two strands (15a, 15b) linked with a blocking device
or blocker (20), and mutually connecting, along a predetermined alternate path, a series of return

elements or guides (1-8) fixedly arranged on the upper on both sides of said opening (11a) near its
respective edges located across from each other and defining a lacing zone (16), so that during a

traction on the skids (15a, 15b) of the lace or cable (15), the latter acts through a tightening on the
edges of the opening via the return elements or guides (1-8) to bring the edges close together and

maintain them in a tightening position on the foot by means of the block (20), characterized in that

the ends of the strands (15a, 15b) forming the lace (15) are made integral with two fixed anchoring
points (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) made in a lower end zone of the lacing, said strands (15a, 15b)

forming between them at their opposite end, a free loop (21) capable of constituting a single gripping
element for exerting a traction along a force (F) symmetrically distributed over each of the strands

(15a, 15b) from the two fixed points.
Boot according to claim 1, characterized in that the anchoring points (G, H) adapted
to the fixing of the ends of the strands (15a, 15b) forming the lace (15) are arranged along an inclined

axis (tt') corresponding substantially to the articulation axis of the metatarsal bones of the user's
foot.
Boot according to claim 2, characterized in that the furthest anchoring point (G)
towards the front (AV) of the boot corresponds to the articulation axis of the metatarsal bones of the

big toe, and ensures the fixing of the end of a first strand (15b) of the lace (15), whereas the other
anchoring point (H) of the end of a second strand (15a) corresponds to the articulation axis of the

metatarsal bones of the small toe and simultaneously ensures the return or guide (4) function of said
first strand (15b), so as to obtain a number of identical guides (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, 6, 7, 8) on each of

the quarters (12, 13) to be tightened. 
Boot according to claim 3, characterized in that it comprises four guides (5, 6, 7, 8)
and one anchoring point (G) on the internal quarter (13), whereas the external quarter (12) comprises

four guides (1, 2, 3, 4), the end one (4) of which also constitutes an anchoring point (H).
Boot according to claim 1, characterized in that the anchoring points (A, B, C, D, E,
F) adapted for the fixing of the ends of the strands (15a, 15b) forming the lace (15) as well as the

return elements or guides (1-8) of each of them, whether or not merging, are symmetrically arranged
across from one another on both sides of the quarters (12, 13) along axes (XX', YY', ZZ', WW'),

parallel with one another and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (VV') of the boot.
Boot according to claim 5, characterized in that the anchoring points (A, B) of the
ends of the strands (15a, 15b) of the lace (15) are arranged across from one another at the end of the

lacing zone, the successive guides (1-8) ensuring a pathway of the strands of the lace (15) for a
symmetrical zig-zag lacing.
Boot according to claim 5, characterized in that the anchoring points (E, F) of the
ends of the strands (15a, 15b) of the lace (15) are arranged, for the one (E), at the end of the lacing

zone on one of the quarters (13) and, for the other (F), immediately in front of a guide (4) arranged
at the end of the lacing zone on the other quarter (12).
Boot according to claim 5, characterized in that the anchoring points (C, D) of the
ends of the strands (15a, 15b) of the lace (15) are successively arranged at the end of the lacing zone

on a same quarter (13), the next to last of the anchoring points (D) ensuring the fixing of the strand
(15a), and simultaneously constituting a return element or guide (7) at a strand (15b) originating

from the other anchoring point (C).
Boot according to one of claims 5-8, characterized in that the number of anchoring
points (A, B, C, D, E, F), whether or not merging with the guides (1-8), whether or not ensuring the

simultaneous action of an shoring point, is equal to 8, and in that these anchoring points/guides 
are symmetrically distributed on both sides of the longitudinal axis (VV') of the boot, on each of the

quarters (12, 13).
Boot according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that each guide (1-8)
is constituted by a flat base (22) comprising a hole (23) for fixing on the boot, made at one of its

ends, and a hook (24) obtained in a single piece
with the base (22) at its other end along a parallel plane, 50

as to demarcate with an internal projection (25) made at the free end of the hook (24), a housing (26)
capable of laterally receiving the lace or cable (15), and of retaining it therein after elastic

deformation of the hook (24) for the passage of the lace or cable.
Boot according to claim 10, characterized in that the bottom (27) of the guide (1-8)
constituted by the attachment zone of the hook (24) with the base (22), is of a section whose

inwardly turned part is rounded to act as a pulley for the passage of the cable (15).
