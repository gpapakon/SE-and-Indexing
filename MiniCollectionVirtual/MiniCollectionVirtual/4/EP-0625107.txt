<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a solenoid valve with an armature (2) which is surrounded by a dome (14) and which lifts in dependence on the current flowing in a solenoid (16) also fitted in the dome (14), so that a valve needle (11) attached to the armature (2) and partly surrounded by a core magnet (13) fits into a valve seat (3) fixed in the valve housing (15). In order to produce a pressure-relief valve function, the motion of the needle (1) in the stepped bore (8) of the armature (2) is governed by a spring fitted between two adjustable stops (6, 7).

An electromagnetic valve, in particular for hydraulic brake 
systems with slip control, including a magnet armature (2) 

which is enclosed by a valve dome (14) and performs a stroke 
movement depending on an energizable magnet coil (16) fitted 

to the valve dome (14), so that a valve needle (1) formed on 
the magnet armature (2) and encircled by a magnet core (13) 

interacts with a valve seat (3) fixed within a valve housing 
(15), wherein the valve needle (1) is guided so as to be 

slidable relative to the magnet armature (2) in its stepped 
bore, so that the stroke movement of the valve needle (1), 

which is adapted to be performed in response to the 
electromagnetic actuating force, is variable by the action 

of a hydraulic actuating force in order to control the 
hydraulic pressure prevailing between a first and at least 

one second pressure fluid duct (11, 12),
characterized
 in that the stepped bore (8) 
extends over nearly the entire length of the magnet armature 

(2), in that an end range of the magnet armature (2) 
encircling the valve needle (1) in an almost disc-shaped 

manner guides the valve needle (1), in that in the closed 
position of the valve, a first stop (6) provided on the 

valve needle (1) is lifted from the shoulder of a bore step 
(9) of the magnet armature (2) by an axial distance (Y) in 

the direction so as to open the valve, in opposition to the 
effect of a compression spring (5) provided in the magnet 

armature (2), and in that a non-ferromagnetic disc (10) is 
compressed between the magnet armature (2) and the magnet 

core (13) in the closed valve position, against which disc a 
resetting spring (4) bears that is supported on the magnet 

core (13).  
 
An electromagnetic valve as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the compression spring 
(5) is compressed between the first stop (6) which can be 

fixed separately to the valve needle (1) and a second stop 
(7) which can be fixed separately within the stepped bore 

(8). 
An electromagnetic valve as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized
 in that the second stop (7) and 
the bore step (9) which has the smaller cross-sectional 

opening area centre the valve needle (1) within the magnet 
armature (2) over nearly the entire length of the magnet 

armature. 
An electromagnetic valve as claimed in at least one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that both the smaller 
cross-sectional opening area in the magnet armature (2) and 

the second stop (7) encircle the valve needle (1) with a 
small surface area, preferably in a disc-shaped manner. 
An electromagnetic valve as claimed in at least one of the 
preceding claims 1 to 5,
characterized
 in that the second stop (7) is 
slidable within the stepped bore (8) by means of an 

adjusting tool, and in that it can be fixed by means of a 
radial force pinching the magnet armature (2).  

 
An electromagnetic valve as claimed in at least one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the first stop (6) is 
slidable on the valve needle (1) and can be fixed to the 

valve needle (1) by means of a pressing tool.
