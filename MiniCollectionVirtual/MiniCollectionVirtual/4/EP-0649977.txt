<ABSTRACT>
A compression braking system for an internal combustion engine 
having at least one working piston including a master piston (22) 

operated by 
an engine component (30) 

such as a fuel injector actuating mechanism and a 
slave piston (12) 

fluidically connected with the master piston (22) to open an engine 
exhaust valve (2,4) 

wherein a pressure relief valve (82) is provided to prevent 
excessively high pressure supply fluid from a 

low pressure supply circuit (34) 
from reaching the high pressure circuit (26) 

connecting the master and slave 
pistons (22,12) thereby preventing inadvertent 

and excessive movement of the slave 
piston (12) 

and possible damage to the engine. The pressure relief valve (82) is 
fluidically connected to the low pressure supply circuit (34) 

upstream of a 
control valve (42) which separates 

the low and high fluid circuits (26,34) and opens to 
vent fluid from the low pressure circuit (34) while allowing continuous, 

uninterrupted operation of the engine in the braking mode. The pressure 
relief valve (82) may include a spring 

biased check valve normally biased in a 
closed position and movable into the open position whenever the pressure 

in the low pressure circuit (34) 
reaches a predetermined level to maintain the 

fluid in the low pressure circuit (34) 
below a predetermined pressure level 

equivalent to a maximum high pressure level in the high pressure circuit 
(26) capable of moving the slave piston.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a braking system for an internal combustion engine according 
to the preamble of claim 1. While the advantages of obtaining a braking effect from the engine of a vehicle 
powered by an internal combustion engine are well known (see e.g. US - A- 
3,220,392), an ideal braking system design characterized by low cost, simplicity, ease 
of maintenance and reliability has not yet been fully achieved. One well-known 
approach has been to convert the engine into a compressor by cutting off fuel flow 
and, opening the exhaust valve for each cylinder near the end of the compression 
stroke; thus, permitting the conversion of the kinetic inertial energy of the vehicle 
into compressed gas energy which may be released to atmosphere when the exhaust 
valves are partially opened. To operate the engine reliably as a compressor, rather 
exacting control is necessary over the timed relationship of exhaust valve opening 
and closing relative to the movement of the associated piston. One technique for accomplishing this result is disclosed in US - A - 3,220,392 to 
Cummins, wherein a slave hydraulic piston opens an exhaust valve near the end of 
the compression stroke of an engine piston  
 
with which the exhaust valve is associated. The slave piston which opens 
the exhaust valve is actuated by a master piston hydraulically linked to the 
slave piston and mechanically actuated by an engine element which is 
displaced periodically in timed relationship with the compression stroke of 
the engine. One such engine element may be the exhaust valve train of 
another cylinder timed to open shortly before the first engine cylinder 
piston reaches the top dead center of its compression stroke. Other engine 
operating elements or components may be used to actuate the master piston 
of the braking system so long as the actuation of the master piston occurs 
at the proper moment near the end of the compression stroke of the piston 
whose associated exhaust valve is to be actuated by the slave piston. For 
example, certain types of compression ignition engines are equipped with 
fuel injector actuating mechanisms which are mechanically actuated near 
the end of the compression stroke of the engine piston with which the fuel 
injector train is associated, thus, providing an actuating mechanism 
immediately adjacent the valve which is to be opened. See also U.S.
