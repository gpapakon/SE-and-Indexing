<ABSTRACT>
A dry starch material is incorporated into a 

comminuted meat which is then shaped as desired. 
Thereafter, a dry mix containing a combination of salt 

having a particle size of 100% by weight minus 100 
U.S. mesh and carrageenan is applied to the surface 

the shaped meat before cooking in a microwave or 
conventional oven. The cooked product retains a 

higher amount of moisture and has improved appearance, 
taste and texture as compared to cooked meat, poultry 

or seafood which is not treated before cooking.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel coating mixes for 
use in treating meat, poultry or seafood prior to 
cooking and to processes employed for applying these 
coating mixes. It is known to add certain materials to uncooked 
meat, poultry or seafood for the purpose of 
tenderizing and/or retaining moisture within the 
cooked foodstuff. For example, hams are injected with 
aqueous solutions of table salt and sodium 
pyrophosphate to achieve improved color and juice 
retention. U.S. Patent No. 3,552,978 discloses the 
surface application of finely divided amino acids 
either alone or in combination with other substances 
such as table salt, spice and/or flavors in order to 
obtain a tenderizing effect on meat. U.S. Patent No. 
3,506,455 discloses impregnating uncooked meat, such 
as by needle injection, with organic material which is 
capable of binding meat fluids and reducing cooking  
 
loss. Materials such as starches, proteins, 
alginates, pectates, carrageenans, gums, modified 
cellulose and mixtures thereof. The use of gelling 
solutions on fresh meat, poultry and seafood in order 
to extend storage life has been disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 3,395,024. The use of calcium salts of 
carrageenan as a coating dispersion for precooked 
meats, poultry and seafood in order to extend frozen 
storage life is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
4,196,219. The use of coating mixes in advance of cooking 
meat, poultry and seafood are known. These coating 
mixes are generally intended to retain moisture, 
improve appearance, tenderize, provide a flavor impact 
or provide a crisp coating. These prior art coatings 
have found utility, particularly in the home 
environment, to enable the preparation of meat, 
poultry and seafood with increased appeal; however, 
these coatings generally do not perform well in 
microwave ovens and do not perform well with meats 
such as pork. It is a particular object of this invention to 
provide cooked comminuted meats which produce improved 
yields (i.e., moisture retention) and tenderness 
across a wide variety of foodstuffs and across a wide 
variety of cooking techniques (e.g. electric or gas-fired 
ovens, electric or gas-fired grills, broilers 
and especially microwave ovens). Meat, poultry and seafood are known to lose 
moisture during cooking in either a conventional or 
microwave oven. This loss is typically more dramatic 
in meat or chicken as compared to seafood and in  
 
microwave ovens as compared to conventional electric 
or gas ovens. The process of this invention relates 
to
