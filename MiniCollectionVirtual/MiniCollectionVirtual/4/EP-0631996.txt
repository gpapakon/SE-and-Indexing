<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric
ceramic composition and, more particularly, to a ceramic
composition useful as a dielectric material for
monolithic ceramic capacitors.As a high permittivity material for ceramic
capacitors, there have widely been used those mainly
comprising BaTiO3 and containing an additive such as
BaSnO3, CaZrO3 and SrTiO3 incorporated therein because of
their high dielectric constant ranging from 2000 to
15000.However, these dielectric materials have such a
disadvantage that they have a high sintering temperature
of 1300 to 1400 °C. This results in increase in a cost
required for sintering. In addition, when producing
monolithic capacitors with such a dielectric material, it
is required to use a material for internal electrodes
which does not melt, oxidize, or react with the
dielectric material at a high temperature of more than
1300 °C since monolithic ceramic capacitor are produced
by the steps of preparing ceramic green sheets, forming
an internal electrode layer on each ceramic green sheet, 
bonding a plurality of green sheets by thermocompression,
and firing the resultant multilayered green
ceramic body. Accordingly, noble metals such as
palladium platinum have widely been used as a material
for internal electrodes of the monolithic ceramic
capacitors. However, the use of the noble metals has
become a bar to reduction of the cost of monolithic
ceramic capacitors since the greater part of the cost
thereof is occupied by the internal electrodes.To solve such problems, it has been proposed to
incorporate a vitreous material containing oxides of B,
Bi and Pb into a BaTiO3-based dielectric ceramic
composition to lower the sintering temperature. The
dielectric ceramic composition containing such a vitreous
material makes it possible to use relatively inexpensive
Ag-Pd alloys as a material for internal electrodes of
monolithic ceramic capacitors since it can be sintered at
a low temperature of 1100 to 1150°C. However, the
incorporation of the vitreous material causes such a
problem that the dielectric constant lowers, resulting in
increase in size of the monolithic ceramic capacitors.
Accordingly, the advantages of the use of the inexpensive
electrode material is cancelled.In addition, the monolithic ceramic capacitors
comprising the BaTiO3-based dielectric ceramic
composition have such a problem that the capacitance 
thereof is affected greatly by a biasing electric field
of a direct current. For example, the capacitance is
lowered about 30 to 80 % of the initial value by
