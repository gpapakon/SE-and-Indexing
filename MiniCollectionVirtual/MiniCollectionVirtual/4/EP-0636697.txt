<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is disclosed for water-granulating slag being 
discharged from a discharging launder (1). The apparatus 

includes a receiving launder (2) arranged below the 
discharging launder (1). The receiving launder (2) has 

opposite side walls to define a widthwise space therebetween. 
A water-jetting device (3) is provided to jet granulating 

water against the slag being discharged from the discharging 
launder to water-granulate the slag. The jetting device (3) 

includes a plurality of partitioning plates (10) arranged in 
the receiving launder (2) so as to span the widthwise space 

between the side walls thereof and spaced from each other so 
as to define a plurality of water outlets, and a water 

supplying unit for supplying the granulating water into the 
water outlets to be jetted therefrom against the slag.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to an apparatus for water-granulating 
slag produced during smelting and/or converting 
operations of nonferrous metals. As is well known in the art, high-temperature slag, which may 
contain, as principal components, iron oxide and calcium oxide, or 
iron oxide and silicon dioxide, is produced in a metallurgical furnace 
such as a converter in the dry copper smelting process. After the 
separation from matte, slag of this kind is crushed into granules by 
bringing it into contact with a large amount of water to effect rapid 
quenching. This operation is, in general, called "water-granulation" 
or "granulation". Japanese Patent Applications, Laid-Open Nos. H4-302993 and 
H4-302994, disclose conventional granulation apparatuses of the 
aforesaid type, which will be hereinafter explained with reference to 
Figs. 1 and 2. As depicted in Fig. 1, the conventional granulation apparatus 
includes a discharging launder 1 for discharging slag produced 
during smelting and/or converting operations; a receiving launder 2 
arranged below the downstream end 1a of the discharging launder 1 
so as to extend in a discharging direction of the slag as indicated by 
the arrow P in Fig. 1; and a water-jetting device 3 for jetting 
granulating water towards the slag, being discharged from the 
discharging launder 1 to the receiving launder 2. The water-jetting  
 
device 3 is constructed to have a large number of elongated water 
nozzles 3a (see Fig. 2), a water-supplying tubular member 3b 
connected to the nozzles in fluid communication therewith, and a 
water conduit 3c connected to the tubular member 3b at its lateral 
side so as to be in fluid communication therewith. The granulation 
apparatus further includes a burner 4 for heating a zone proximate 
to the discharging end 1a of the discharging launder 1 and an 
explosion-proof hood 5 for covering such a zone to prevent slag from 
being scattered in case of the occurrence of a phreatic explosion. In the conventional apparatus as described above, a great 
amount of granulating water is supplied into the water nozzles 3a 
via the conduit 3c and the tubular member 3b. The granulating 
water thus supplied is jetted out from the nozzles 3a at a high 
jetting rate in a direction in which the receiving launder 2 extends, 
and contacts the high temperature slag, falling from the discharging 
end 1a of the discharging launder 1. Thus, the slag is rapidly 
quenched and crushed into granules which have a size of the order 
of several millimeters. In

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for water-granulating slag, comprising: 
   a receiving device having an upwardly directed opening for 

receiving slag discharged during smelting and/or converting 
operations, said receiving device having opposite side plates to 

define a widthwise space therebetween; and 
   a water-jetting device attached to said receiving device for 

jetting granulating water to the slag, being discharged into said 
receiving device, to water-granulate the slag, 

   characterized in that said water-jetting device includes a 
plurality of partitioning plates arranged in said receiving device so 

as to span said widthwise space between said side plates thereof 
and spaced from each other so as to define a plurality of water 

outlets, and a water-supplying unit attached to said receiving device 
for supplying the granulating water into the water outlets, whereby 

the granulating water supplied from said water-supplying unit is 
jetted from the water outlets against the slag. 
A water-granulating apparatus as defined in claim 1, wherein 
said receiving device includes a receiving launder having upstream 

and downstream ends and inclined downwardly from said upstream 
end to said downstream end, and wherein said partitioning plates 

are disposed at said upstream end of said receiving launder to 
permit the granulating water to be jetted from said upstream end 

towards said downstream end. 
A water-granulating apparatus as defined in claim 2, further 
comprising a discharging launder for discharging the slag into said 

receiving launder, said discharging launder having a discharging 
outlet arranged above said upstream end of said receiving launder
