<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an integrated anti-theft and checkout system 
for checking out articles which comprise an anti-theft label. 

The system comprises input means by which an article code of 
at least one article to be checked out can be recorded for 

checking out that article and deactivation means for 
deactivating the anti-theft label of an article which has been 

checked out. According to the invention, the system further 
comprises sensor means by which measurable characteristics 

such as the mass and/or the shape of at least one article can 
be measured and a check unit which verifies whether an 

inputted article code corresponds with the characteristics of 
an article as measured by the sensor means, the check unit 

activating the deactivation means for deactivating the anti-theft 
label of the article when the inputted article code 

corresponds with the measured characteristics. The invention 
also relates to a method for checking out articles using such 

system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an integrated anti-theft and 
checkout system for checking out articles which comprise an 
anti-theft label, the system comprising input means by which 
an article code of at least one article to be checked out can 
be recorded for the purpose of checking out that article and 
deactivation means for deactivating the anti-theft label of an 
article which has been checked out. Such a system is known, for instance, from international 
patent application 9020785. In that system, so-called bar 
codes provided on the articles are used to identify these 
articles for checking them out at the checkout system. After 
the bar codes have been read out, the anti-theft labels 
provided on the articles are deactivated, so that no alarm is 
given anymore if these articles leave the store in which the 
checkout system is used by way of an anti-theft gate. In these 
existing systems, all labels located in the electromagnetic 
field generated by the deactivator are deactivated. This means 
that several articles can be deactivated simultaneously 
without all of the bar codes having been recorded and 
processed by the checkout system. This makes it possible for 
operator staff to deactivate articles without the articles 
being checked out or recorded, which phenomenon is sometimes 
referred to as 'sweethearting'. The object of the present 
invention is to provide a solution to this problem by 
effecting a coupling between the deactivation and the 
registration of articles. To that end, a system according to the invention comprises 
sensor means by which measurable characteristics such as the 
mass and/or the shape of at least one article can be measured 
and a check unit which verifies whether an inputted article 
code corresponds with the characteristics of an article as 
measured by the sensor means, the check unit activating the 
deactivation means for deactivating the anti-theft label of 
the article when the inputted article code corresponds with 
the measured characteristics.  By virtue of the above measures, an anti-theft label of an 
article can be deactivated only when the article code of the 
article in question has been inputted into the checkout system 
for the purpose of the checkout transaction. When for whatever 
reason it is attempted, for instance, to deactivate the labels 
of two articles simultaneously while the article code of only 
one of the two articles has been inputted, no deactivation 
will take place since the measured characteristics of the two 
articles together do not
