<ABSTRACT>
Such a circuit arrangement is used especially for supplying sensors in a motor vehicle with a constant voltage required for accurate measuring results. It contains a reference voltage source (10) and a transistor (7) which is connected as emitter follower and by means of which the reference voltage is provided buffered at an output (4) as supply voltage for a sensor (3). A short circuit current through the transistor (7) is limited by a first current source (6). A diode (8) compensates for the voltage drop across the base-emitter path of the transistor (7). A second current source (9) drives a constant current through the diode (8).
