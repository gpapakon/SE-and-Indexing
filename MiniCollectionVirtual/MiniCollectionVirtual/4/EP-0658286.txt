<ABSTRACT>
The rotary switch includes two coaxial parts (1, 2). One of the said parts (1, 2) carries a multistage driving gear (4) and the other part (2, 1) carries a multistage driven gear (5). The first stage (41) of the driving gear (4) is tubular with a local, radially projecting lug (44). The first stage (61) of the driven gear (5) includes contact toothing (51) which can be driven by said lug (44). The second stage (42) of the driving gear (4), which is aligned with the lug (44), is tubular and has a release recess (45). The second stage (62) of the driven gear (5) comprises locking toothing (52) engaging with said release recess to unlock the driven gear (5). This invention is useful for motor vehicles.

A rotary contactor, especially for a motor vehicle, 
of the kind comprising two coaxial parts (1, 2) which 

are mounted for rotation with respect to each other 
against the action of flexible transmission means for 

electrical connection (3) which comprise a ribbon 
spiral-wound between the said parts (1, 2), 

characterised in that one of the said parts (1, 2) 
carries an axially stepped driving wheel (4), while the 

other one of the said parts (2, 1) carries, for 
cooperation with the driving wheel (4), an axially 

stepped driven wheel (5), in that a first stage (41) of 
the driving wheel (4) has a tubular form which is 

interrupted locally by a radially projecting lug (44), 
while a first stage (61) of the driven wheel (5) has 

contact teeth (51) which are adapted to be driven by 
the said lug (44), in that a second stage (42) of the 

driving wheel (4) has a tubular form which is 
interrupted locally by a relieving recess (45), while a 

second stage (62) of the driven wheel (5) has stop 
teeth (52) which are adapted to cooperate with the 

second stage (42) of the driving wheel (4) and to 
penetrate into the said relieving recess (45), so as to 

unlock the driven wheel.  
 
A rotary contactor according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the stop teeth (52) are offset 

circumferentially with respect to the contact teeth 
(51). 
A rotary contactor according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that, by virtue of their tubular form, 

the first stage (41) and the second stage (42) of the 
driving wheel (4) each defines a circular outer track 

at its outer periphery, and in that the said tracks are 
of different diameters, the one which is associated 

with the lug (44) having a smaller diameter than the 
one associated with the recess (45). 
A rotary contactor according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the contact teeth (51) project 

radially with respect to the stop teeth (52). 
A rotary contactor according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that there is a slight clearance 

between the contact teeth (51) and the tubular first 
stage (41) of the driving wheel (4), while the stop 

teeth (52) are in sliding contact with the tubular 
second stage (42) of the driving wheel (4). 
A rotary contactor according to any one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the first stage (41) of the 

driven wheel (5) has a circular stop sector (53) which 
is adapted to cooperate the first stage (41) of the 

driving wheel (4).  
 
A rotary contactor according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the second stage (62) of the 

driven wheel (5) further includes a circular terminal 
sector. 
A rotary contactor according to any one of Claims 1 
to 7, characterised in that the lug (44) is aligned 

with the relieving recess (45).
