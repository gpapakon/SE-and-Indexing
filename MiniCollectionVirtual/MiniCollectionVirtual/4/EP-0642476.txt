<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to aqueous 
compatible furan binder compositions for glass fibers, 
a process for binding glass fibers, and also to glass 
fiber compositions utilizing the binders. Fiber glass comes in many shapes and sizes 
and can be used for a variety of applications. A 
general discussion of fiber glass technology is provided 
in "Fiber Glass" by J. Gilbert Mohr and William 
P. Rowe, Van Nostran Reinhold Co., New York 1978 which 
is herein incorporated by reference. As discussed in "Fiber Glass", glass fibers 
are generally mass produced in two types: bulk or 
blown fiber for insulation and allied applications, 
and continuous-filament, or reinforcing fibers. In 
either form raw fiber glass is abrasive and easily 
fragmentized. Damage to the individual glass fibers 
can occur as a result of the self-abrasive motion of 
one fiber passing over or interacting with another 
fiber. The resulting surface defects cause reductions 
in overall mechanical strength. Consequently, binders have been developed to 
prevent these problems. A typical binder may prevent 
the destructive effects of self-abrasion without inhibiting  
 
the overall flexibility of the finished glass 
fiber product. Extremely good resistance and 
resilience to conditions of elevated humidity and heat 
are beneficial in view of the wide variety of end use 
applications for glass fiber/binder compositions. One of the most important performance properties 
is a consequence of the practical realities of 
the glass fiber manufacturing business. Cured glass 
fiber/binder compositions are normally very bulky and 
voluminous. Batts and rolls used as insulation in 
buildings have densities ranging from 8 to 16 kg/m3 
and generally require binder contents of 3 to 7% by 
weight. Since it is prohibitively expensive to ship 
such materials in an uncompressed state, the batts and 
rolls are bundled and compressed in packages to 8 to 
25% of their manufactured thickness. During the 
shipping process these packages are normally subjected 
to conditions of elevated temperature and humidity. 
Once the compressed batt or roll reaches the consumer 
and is removed from its packaging, it should recover 
between 40% to 100% of its original volume. 
Insulation materials not achieving such recovery 
values normally have difficulty meeting advertised 
thermal resistivity (R) values. In general, the 
better the recovery value of the glass fiber/binder 
composition, the better insulating properties the 
composition will possess. Fiber glass products denser
