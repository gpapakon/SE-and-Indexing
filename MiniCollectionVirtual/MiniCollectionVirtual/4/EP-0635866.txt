<ABSTRACT>
A lamp inlead assembly for a light source having a lamp envelope 
with at least one end region in which the lamp inlead assembly is sealably 

disposed includes and outer lead wire member to which power to the light 
source is coupled, an inner lead wire member to which the light 

generating device is connected, whether incandescent or discharge, and 
a thin foil member disposed therebetween on which the inner and outer 

lead wire members are fixedly secured. The thin foil member is 
constructed of molybdenum and is essentially uniform in thickness 

throughout. At least one trough is formed in the foil member and is 
effective so as to: increase the surface area of the foil member and thus 

improve its current carrying properties without increasing the dimensional 
space within the end region of the lamp area to accommodate such 

increased surface area, provide increased rigidity for the foil member so 
that such foil member can be adapted for handling by high speed 

automated manufacturing equipment, and, with one trough centrally 
disposed along the width dimension of the foil member, insure that the 

positioning of the lead wire members relative to the foil member is 
maintained throughout the manufacture of both the lamp inlead assembly 

itself as well as the manufacture operations involving the insertion of the 
inlead assembly and sealing thereof into the light source.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lamp inlead assembly having an 
improved formed molybdenum foil configuration. More particularly, this 
invention relates to such a lamp inlead assembly as exhibits improved 
stability characteristics that allow for implementation in a high speed 
automated manufacturing environment so as to achieve accurate 
positioning of the inlead assembly within the lamp without risking damage 
to the inlead assembly as may otherwise be caused by the manufacturing 
process. A conventional lamp inlead assembly which can be utilized for 
instance in a high pressure discharge lamp or a halogen filament lamp, 
typically includes an outer lead wire, a thin molybdenum foil and an inner 
lead wire. This assembly can be inserted into a double ended lamp 
envelope which is then pressed, or shrunk over the inlead assembly to 
provide a hermetic seal for the inner chamber of the lamp envelope. 
Typically, the molybdenum foil is extremely thin, being on the order of no 
more than 3 mils (7.62 Ã— 10-3 cm) thick with feathered edges on either side. Though the 
feathered edges are effective for allowing a more complete sealing 
operation to be performed at the ends of the lamp envelope, such 
feathered edges are susceptible to damage when handled during the 
lamp assembly process particularly if a high speed automated 
manufacturing process is utilized for assembly of the lamp or the lamp 
inlead assembly. One approach to avoid the handling problem for thin molybdenum  
 
foils can be found in US Patent No. 4,254,356 issued to Karikas on March 
3, 1991 and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention. In 
this patent, a Z-shaped foil configuration is utilized wherein the edges of 
the foil are turned outward in opposite directions thereby rendering the foil 
member more rigid and less susceptible to damage from indelicate 
handling. This approach has proven effective not only in strengthening 
the foil member but has done so without suffering from a reduction in the 
quality of the seal formed by shrinking or pressing the end of the lamp 
envelope around the lamp inlead assembly. One problem that has remained however in the use of such a Z-shaped 
foil configuration relates to the ability to maintain the control of the 
positioning between the lead wires and the foil member just prior to 
and/or just after attachment of the lead wires to the foil member. That is, 
because the center portion of the Z-shaped foil member is essentially flat, 
maintaining the essentially round lead wire in a
