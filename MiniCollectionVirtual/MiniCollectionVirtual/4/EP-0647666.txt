<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of polyisocyanate preparations which are liquid at room temperature and have a content of aromatically bonded isocyanate groups of up to 43.5% by weight, of urea groups of up to 0.88 mol/kg and of urethane groups of up to 1.35 mol/kg by heating aromatic polyisocyanates having an NCO content of up to 48.3% with comminuted polyurethane-polyureas having a urea group content of up to 2.5 mol/kg and a urethane group content of up to 3.8 mol/kg until the mixture is completely homogenised, the resultant polyisocyanate preparations, and the use thereof as polyisocyanate component in the preparation of polyurethane elastomers containing urea groups by reaction injection moulding.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing polyisocyanate preparations which are liquid at room temperature 
and which have a content of aromatically bonded isocyanate groups of up to 43.5 % by 

weight, by heating 

a) polyisocyanate mixtures of the diphenylmethane series, which are liquid at room 
temperature, which have an NCO content of 25 to 33.6 % by weight and which are 

optionally chemically modified, with 
b) up to 35 % by weight, with respect to the total weight of components a) and b), of 
polyurethane plastics which are present in comminuted form, 
 
characterised in that polyurethanes which comprise urea groups, which have a density greater 

than 0.9 g/cm
3
, a content of urea groups of 0.15 to 2.5 mole/kg, and a content of urethane 
groups of 0.15 to 3.8 mole/kg, are used as the polyurethane plastics in comminuted form, 

and the mixture is heated to temperatures above 160Â°C until the complete homogenisation 
thereof.
