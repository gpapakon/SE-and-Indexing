<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to reversing the trend 
in conventional video printing by providing a cost-effective, 

flexible device (200) which is independent of the printing 
device (106) such that it can be used with any conventional 

computer printing device to provide plain paper prints (602) 
of video images. By focusing on optimizing cost-effectiveness 

and system flexibility rather than providing high resolution 
photographic quality prints, the present invention can provide 

video printing features never before realized. Generally 
speaking, the present invention relates to a method and 

apparatus (200) for processing an input video data stream 
(104) by selecting at least a portion of a frame of the input 

video data stream as printable image data, and by processing 
the selected at least a portion of a frame (406) to correlate 

the at least a portion of the frame to said input video data 
stream using at least one identifier. Further, the present 

invention relates to a method and apparatus for processing an 
input video data stream by storing at least a portion of a 

frame of the input video data stream as printable image data, 
and by processing the printable image data to automatically 

reposition the at least a portion of the frame on a printable 
medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
video printing, and more particularly, to printing 
video images on a printable medium. Video printers for producing photographic-like 
images from a video input are knob. These devices 
produce high resolution images on a medium such as 
thermal paper. For example, a video printer is described in a 
brochure entitled, "Color Video Printer UP-5100/UP-5150" 
available from Sony Corp. A brochure 
entitled, "Near Photographic Quality Color Prints 
From A Variety of Video Sources" describes a Color 
Video Printer UP-3000 also available from Sony Corp. 
The video printers as described in these brochures 
are directed to providing high quality prints of 
video images on photographic-like paper. A brochure 
entitled, "CP-110U Color Video Printer," and a 
brochure entitled, "CP-210U Large Format Color Video 
Printer," both available from Mitsubishi, describe 
similar devices for producing high resolution prints 
of video images on photographic-like paper. Virtually all video printers, including those 
described above, are integrated and dedicated 
devices based on dye-sublimation or thermal transfer 
print mechanisms. These video printers inherently 
define (and limit) the physical attributes of the 
printed media, including size of the media, size and 
number of images per page, and amount and legibility 
of textual annotations. Furthermore, conventional 
video printers have traditionally printed a single  
 
image per piece of media, although more recent video 
printers can print multiple images (same or 
different) on one piece of media. Despite their apparent appeal, conventional 
video printers have only realized limited commercial 
use. This is because conventional video printers 
reflect the trend to focus on producing high 
resolution prints of near photographic quality 
without regard to commercial practicality. 
Accordingly, conventional video printers suffer 
significant drawbacks which are believed to have 
resulted in their commercial impracticality. Some 
of these drawbacks are as follows: 
(1) the photographic-like paper required 
by conventional video printers (e.g., thermal paper) 
is awkward and difficult to handle (e.g., curling up 
after being printed); (2) the photographic paper required by 
conventional video printers is costly, rendering the 
printing of more than a few photographic images 
prohibitively expensive; and (3) because special photographic-like 
paper is used by conventional video printers, they 
must be designed as integral units

<CLAIMS>
Method for processing a video data stream (104) 
received via an input (102), the method being characterized by 

steps of selecting at least a portion of a frame (406) of the 
input video data stream as printable image data (602); and 

processing (200) said selected at least a portion of the frame 
to correlate said at least a portion of the frame to said 

input video data stream using at least one identifier (Fig. 
4). 
Method according to Claim 1, further characterized by 
a step of controlling storage of said at least a portion of 

the frame and said at least one identifier as printable image 
data, and printing said at least a portion of the frame and 

said identifier (Fig. 4, Fig. 6). 
Method according to Claim 1, further characterized by 
steps of storing at least portions of plural frames (406) of 

the input data stream in sequential order of receipt; storing 
at least one identifier in response to a control input (332) 

to establish a re-ordered print sequence for said plural 
frames (Fig. 4); and printin
g said plural frames in said re-ordered 
print sequence (Fig. 4). 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein said step of 
processing is further characterized by a step of controlling 

storage of an index as printable image data, said index 
identifying a sequential location of said at least a portion
