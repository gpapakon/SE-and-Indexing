Esters of fatty acids with ethoxylated polyols 
obtainable by 


a) ethoxylating polyols with 110 to 200 moles of ethylene 
oxide per mole of polyol at elevated temperatures 

in the presence of basic catalysts and 
b) subsequently reacting the reaction product with 1 
to 1.3 moles of fatty acid per mole of the hydroxyl 

groups present in the original polyol in the presence 
of acidic catalysts. 
Esters as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the polyols are selected from the group consisting of 

glycerol, diglycerol, triglycerol, oligoglycerols with an 
average degree of condensation of 4 to 10, trimethylol 

propane and pentaerythritol. 
Esters as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the fatty acids correspond to formula (I): 

R
1
CO-OH
 
in which R
1
CO is a linear or branched, aliphatic, optionally 
hydroxy-substituted acyl radical containing 6 to 22 

carbon atoms and 0, 1, 2 or 3 double bonds. 
A process for the production of esters of fatty 
acids with ethoxylated polyols, 
characterized in that
a) polyols are ethoxylated with 110 to 200 moles of 
ethylene oxide per mole of polyol at elevated 

temperatures in the presence of basic catalysts and 
b) the reaction product is subsequently reacted with 1 
to 1.3 moles of fatty acid per mole of the hydroxyl  

 
groups present in the original polyol in the presence 

of acidic catalysts. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in 
that
 the polyols used are selected from the group consisting 
of glycerol, diglycerol, triglycerol, oligoglycerols 

with an average degree of condensation of 4 to 10, 

trimethylol propane and pentaerythritol. 
A process as claimed in claims 4 and 5, 
characterized 
in that
 basic catalysts selected from the group 
consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, 

sodium methylate, calcined hydrotalcite and hydrotalcite 
hydrophobicized with fatty acids are used for the ethoxylation. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 4 to 
4, 
characterized in that
 the ethoxylation is carried out 
at a temperature of 120 to 190°C. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 4 to 
7, characterized in that the ethoxylation is carried out 

under a pressure of 1 to 5 bar. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 4 to 
8, 
characterized in that
 fatty acids corresponding to 
formula (I): 


R
1
CO-OH
 
in which R
1
CO is a linear or branched, aliphatic, optionally 
hydroxy-substituted acyl radical containing 6 to 22 

carbon atoms and 0, 1, 2 or 3 double bonds, 
are used. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 4 to 
9, 
characterized in that
 acidic catalysts selected from 
the group consisting of methanesulfonic acid, butanesulfonic 

acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenesulfonic 
acid, alkyl benzenesulfonic acid and sulfosuccinic acid  

 
are used for the esterification. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 4 to 
10, 
characterized in that
 the esterification is carried 
out at temperatures of 140 to 200°C. 
The use of the esters claimed in claims 1 to 3 as 
thickeners for aqueous surfactant solutions. 
The use of the esters produced by the process 
claimed in claims 4 to 11 as thickeners for aqueous 

surfactant solutions.
