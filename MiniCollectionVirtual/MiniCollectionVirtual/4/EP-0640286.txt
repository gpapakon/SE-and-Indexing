<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a process for controlling unwanted 
plants by applying, to unwanted plants, a herbicidally effective amount of one or 
more compound selected from acivicin, derivatives of acivicin, salts of acivicin and 
salts of acivicin derivatives. The present invention is also concerned with certain 
derivatives of acivicin, salts of acivicin and salts of acivicin derivatives. Acivicin is obtained from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces sviceus. It has 
been used in the treatment of certain mammalian cancers such as human lung and 
breast carcinoma xenografts and in mouse leukemias. By practice of the present invention, there may be provided a herbicidal 
composition comprising a herbicidally effective amount of one or more compounds 
selected from acivicin, derivatives of acivicin, salts of acivicin and salts of acivicin 
derivatives, and an agriculturally acceptable carrier therefor. By practice of the present invention there may also be provided compounds 
and herbicidal compositions which are selectively herbicidally active to unwanted 
plants. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a process 
for controlling unwanted plants, which comprises the step of applying, to the 
unwanted plant, a herbicidally effective amount of one or more compounds selected 
from acivicin, derivatives of acivicin, salts of acivicin and salts of acivicin 
derivatives. In the process of the present invention said compound(s) may be in the form 
of a herbicidal composition containing an agriculturally acceptable carrier. Accordingly to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a 
compound of the formula (III): 
   wherein: Y is : hydrogen; amino; an ammonium or mono-, di-, or 
trialkylammonium salt with an agronomically acceptable anion; or an optionally 
protected peptide of one or more amino acids;
 
   X is: halo such as chloro, fluoro, iodo or bromo; cyano; a sulfonate group of 
the formula OSO₂R¹ wherein R¹ is a C₁ to C₄ alkyl group; or an optionally 
substituted phenyl ring; and preferably is a halo group;
 
   Z is: hydrogen; a carboxyl protecting group; or an agronomically acceptable 
cation; and preferably is hydrogen, sodium or isopropyl ammonium. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a 
herbicidal composition, which comprises one or more compound of forumula (III), 
and an agronomically acceptable carrier therefor. Acivicin is represented by the following formula (II): 
Acivicin, derivatives of acivicin,
