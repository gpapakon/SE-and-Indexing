<ABSTRACT>
The invention shows process steps for producing anchorage surfaces (3) on metallic joint implants which are located at an angle 0 
<
 alpha  
<
 90 degrees counter to the insertion and fixing direction (40) and have cup-shaped shoulder sections (14) which are open for anchorage counter to the insertion and fixing direction (40). In a first step, recesses (6) and shoulders (8) are produced by machining, casting or pressing in the anchorage surfaces (3) of a blank (2) perpendicular to the insertion and fixing direction (40). The shoulders (8) have an acute-angled cross-section, a height (10) between 03. and 2 mm and a distance (31) which corresponds approximately to twice the height (10). In a second step, a pressing tool (13) which has counter-surfaces to the anchorage surfaces (3), which counter-surfaces are provided with projecting ribs (26) whose mid-planes are perpendicular to the counter-surface and parallel to the insertion and fixing direction (40), is used to produce troughs (15) through the shoulders (8). At the same time, the edges (17) of the shoulder sections (14) are deformed and cup-shaped moulds (18) open counter to the insertion and fixing direction (40) are formed as support.

A process for the production of outer anchoring faces
(3) on joint implants made from a plastically

deformable metal, whereby the anchoring faces are at
an angle Î± of between 0 and 90 degrees to an insertion

and attachment direction (40) of the joint implant,
characterised in that
 in a step I on a blank (2)
recesses (6) are produced in the anchoring faces at

right angles to the insertion and attachment direction
by machining, casting or pressing, so that acute-angled

shoulders (8) remain, which have a height (10)
of between 0.3 and 2 mm, while the distance between

two adjacent shoulder points (11, 12) roughly
corresponds to twice the height (10),
and in that
 in a step II, with a pressing tool (13),
the base (34) of which corresponds to the shell face

on the anchoring faces (3) of the blank (2) and from
the base (34) of which ribs (26) protrude, which

extend with their centre planes perpendicularly to the
base (34) and parallel to the insertion and attachment

direction (40), the blank (2) is deformed by pressing
in the insertion and attachment direction (40) so that

troughs (15), which leave shoulder portions (14), are
produced with the ribs (26) at right angles to the

shoulders (8), the shoulder edges (17) in the region
of the troughs (15) being plastically deformed against

the insertion and attachment direction (40), in order
to produce thus cupular shapes (18), which are opened

against the insertion and attachment direction (40),

from the shoulder portions (14).
A process for producing outer anchoring faces (3) on
metallic hip joint shells, which are preferably made

from pure titanium,
characterised in that
 in a step I on a shell blank
(2b) in the form of an approximately spherical half

shell by turning around its pole axis (4) recesses (6)
are produced, which leave acute-angled shoulders

between them, the height (20) of which is between 0.3
and 2 mm, while the distance (31) between two shoulder

points (11, 12) corresponds roughly to twice the
height (10),
and in that
 in a step II the shell blank (2c) in a
deep-drawing tool (13e, 13f) having a hemispherical

recess, which comprises ribs (26) protruding towards
the pole axis (4) on meridian lines, which ribs are

dimensioned so that when pressing the shell blank
towards the pole axis (4) they produce troughs (15)

with intervening shoulder portions (14), so that with
increasing proximity of the pole side to the equator

(32) of the shell they plastically deform the shoulder
edges (17) in the region of the troughs (15) towards

the equator and so that in this way cupular shapes
(18) open towards the equator are produced from

shoulder portions (14).
A process according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the ribs (26) on the meridian
lines of the deep-drawing tool (13e, 13f) comprise a

mutual spacing of between 0.5 and 4 mm and have the
shape of an acute-angled ridge roof (16).
A process according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that
 in a preliminary step V1 the
shell blank (2a) is shaped from a circular sheet blank

(1) in a deep-drawing tool (13a, 13b, 24).
A process according to one of Claims 2 to 4,
characterised in that
 in a preliminary step V2 at
least three longitudinal grooves (20) are provided on 

the periphery of the equator with a deep-drawing tool
(13c, 13d, 22).
A process according to one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that
 in an intermediate step Z
mounting faces (20, 21) are provided for clamping

means (23) for the subsequent machining steps.
A process according to one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that
 in a subsequent step N an inner
contour (19) of the metallic hip joint shell is

finished to receive and anchor an acetabulum.
