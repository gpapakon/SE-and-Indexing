Belt drive for transmitting power from a vehicle (10) 
to an implement coupled to the vehicle (10) to allow 

vertical movement, with a primary belt (34), which may 
be driven by the power source of the vehicle (10), a 

secondary belt (38) driving at least one driving 
pulley (44) arranged on the implement and a jack 

sheave (36) connecting the primary belt (34) and 
secondary belt (38) to one another, wherein a sheave 

of said jack sheave (36) may be driven by the primary 
belt (34) and the secondary belt via a second sheave 

on the jack sheave (36), characterised in that at 
least the sheave of the jack sheave (36), around which 

the primary belt (34) circulates, may be shifted in 
planes which intersect the rotational plane of the 

driving pulley (44). 
Belt drive according to Claim 1, wherein the 
jack sheave (36) is arranged to pivot on the 

implement, characterised in that the jack sheave (36) 
is arranged to tilt with its longitudinal axis on the 

implement. 
Belt drive according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the jack sheave (36) is pivotally connected to the 

vehicle (10). 
Belt drive according to Claim 1, wherein the 
jack sheave (36) is arranged to pivot on the 

implement, characterised in that the jack sheave (36) 
is arranged to tilt with its longitudinal axis on the 

implement and is pivotally connected to the vehicle 
(10).  

 
Belt drive according to one or some of the previous 
claims, characterised in that the jack sheave (36) is 

coupled to the implement and/or to the vehicle (10) 
via a sliding connection. 
Belt drive according to one or some of the previous 
claims, wherein the primary belt (34) may be driven 

via an output sheave (32), characterised in that the 
jack sheave (36) is arranged between the output sheave 

(32) and the implement. 
Belt drive according to one or some of the previous 
claims, wherein the implement is connected to the 

vehicle (10) to pivot around a horizontal axis (22), 
characterised in that the tilting connection (54) of 

the jack sheave (36) with the implement is provided in 
front or to the rear of the horizontal axis (22) and 

the pivotal connection (62) with the vehicle (10) is 
provided to the rear or in front of the horizontal 

axis (22). 
Belt drive according to one or some of the previous 
claims, wherein the jack sheave (36) is arranged to 

rotate on a support member (48), characterised in that 
the support member (48) is connected to the implement 

to pivot vertically and has an arm member (56) which 
is slidably connected to the vehicle (10) to pivot 

vertically. 
Belt drive according to Claim 8, characterised in that 
the jack sheave (36) is connected to the support 

member (48) to pivot horizontally. 
Belt drive according to one or some of the previous  
 

claims, wherein the implement can assume a vertical 
position relative to the vehicle (10) in which the 

primary belt (34) and the secondary belt (38) 
circulate in two parallel horizontal planes, 

characterised in that the jack sheave (36) is coupled 
to the implement and vehicle (10) in such a way that 

when the implement is lifted from this vertical 
position, the jack sheave (36) tilts in a vertical 

plane in the direction of the output sheave (32) 
driving the primary belt (34) and is tilted in the 

opposite direction when the implement is lowered from 
said vertical position.
