<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coding apparatus
for image compression that compresses the data of a digital
image signal.As a highly efficient compression technique for
encoding natural images, there has been proposed a method
of performing a 2-dimensional discrete cosine transform
(called DCT hereafter) and quantizing the transform
coefficients to encode them into variable-length codes.
This method is adopted by the JPEG (Joint Photographic
Experts Group) of CCITT/ISO.The variable-length coding part of this method
uses a single table of codes to perform variable-length
coding. However, if statistical properties of input
symbols and characteristics of the variable-length coding
are in disagreement, the efficiency of coding declines.
Therefore, a method of preparing several tables of
variable-length codes and selecting one of them for
encoding was proposed (for example,
JP-A-4-87469).In this method, the variance of the DCT 
coefficients after quantizing in each block is obtained,
and one of the several tables of variable-length codes is
selected based on the variance to perform variable-length
coding.However, the statistical properties of occurring
symbols vary not only from block to block but also greatly
vary depending on the order of the transformed domain in
each block. Therefore, by the above method, a table of
variable-length codes can not be selected depending on the
order of the transformed domain. Further, the method
requires much more overhead information for indicating a
selected table of variable-length codes.The object of the present invention is therefore
to solve the above problems and to provide a coding
apparatus for image compression that improves the
efficiency of variable-length coding.In order to achieve the aforementioned objective, 
according to the present invention, there is provided a coding apparatus for image
compression comprising a transform means which transforms image data into a
plurality of transform coefficients, a quantization means which quantizes each of
said transform coefficients into a coefficient data word of a predetermined number
of bits, a data division means which divides each coefficient data word corresponding
to a low-frequency domain into a first data part and a second data part,
a multiplexer means which multiplexes the second data part and a coefficient data
word corresponding to a high-frequency domain, and a variable-length coding
means which encodes the output from said multiplexer means into a variable-length
code.Further advantageous embodiments
