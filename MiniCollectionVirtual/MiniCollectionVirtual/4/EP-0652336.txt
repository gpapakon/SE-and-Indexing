<ABSTRACT>
A prefabricated industrial floor for forming a multi-storey 
prefabricated structure consisting of an interlocking node frame 

with a capital totally contained within the floor thickness (19), 
formed from a plurality of tile elements (11) arranged side by 

side parallel to each other which do not require the laying of a 
make-up casting, which can have the floor surface already 

incorporated, and which form a service compartment (22) on the 
ceiling side and a service compartment (21, 32) on the flooring 

side, both inspectionable, and from tile support beams (20) which 
are produced with the same equipment and have the same soffit 

appearance. The capital, beams and tiles are provided with a 
series of holes (24, 24') which lighten the structure, which 

cannot be seen, and which can be used for service passages or for 
floor stiffening cross-members (25). The structure, of high fire 

resistance, is designed so that, without any formal variation, the 
tile (11) can be replaced by a beam (edge beam, wind beam, beam 

for high concentrated loads).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an industrially produced prestressed
concrete floor of variable height for forming multi-storey
prefabricated structures.Many different floor elements are currently available, such as to
enable a large number of different floor arrangements to be
constructed.A system which can be taken as reference is the double-T system,
even though it competes for small heights with the multi-hole
extruded floor the production of which is limited to a height of
40 cm. In addition the double-T system offers considerable
versatility and a wide capacity range. However the double-T
system found itself in crisis when the market began to insist on a
small height, a high fire resistance (90-120 minutes) and a flat
soffit for movable partitions.If the penalizing technical characteristics of the double-T system
are analyzed, it can be stated that its formation with a very high
centre of gravity is not the most suitable for a floor. In this
respect the limit to the use of the double-T system derives from
its small mass at its lower edge, which poses a limit on the
maximum prestressing reinforcement. In addition because of its high centre of gravity the double-T
floor suffers from a considerable rise and hence the danger of
large rise differences.The considerable rise is a drawback, the rise variation creating a
step between two adjacent tiles requiring a make-up casting
sometimes of large height, so much so that the rise difference
becomes absolutely unacceptable and a just reason for serious
dispute.Consequently a floor is needed having a cross-section
characterised by a centre of gravity at approximately half its
height and hence with very similar section moduli (Ws and Wi).
This is not so in the case of the double-T system slab, which for
its final strength has an overabundant width the purpose of which
is to support a compression cap cast in situ and suitably
reinforced, to provide load distribution and planarity of the
flooring.DE-A-2 324 224 discloses a prefabricated industrial floor having
the features of the preamble of claim 1.
FR-A-2 667 337 relates to a prefabricated industrial floor formed from
a plurality of tiles and having main beams provided with holes.An object of the invention is to obviate these drawbacks by
providing a price-competitive prefabricated floor of high
technical performance, low weight and considerable utilization
versatility and functionality.A further object is to provide a highly industrialized
prefabricated floor of height between 25 and 125 cm, without a
cooperating
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A prefabricated industrial floor formed from a plurality
of tile elements (11) of variable height arranged side by side parallel

to each other, said side-by-side tile
elements (11) form a series of service compartments (21, 22, 32)

open at least at their treading surface, closure plates (17, 18,
30, 33) being positioned at said hence defined apertures to

provide coplanarity of said floor, to distribute loads without
laying a make-up casting and to form a finished floor surface, in combination with said tile elements (11) main frame beams (20) are provided with a plurality of holes (24') in their side walls,

characterised in that each of said tile elements (11) is provided with a plurality of holes (24) in its side walls (13), and that said plurality of holes (24, 24') receives stiffening elements (25).
An industrial floor as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that said main frame beams (20) of variable height are provided

having their soffit identical to said tile element (11).
An industrial floor as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that said holes (24, 24') are closed by a

removable thickness of concrete.
An industrial floor as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that said stiffening elements (25) consist of tubular portions

(26) inserted through said holes (24, 24') and alternating with 
wall portions (27).
An industrial floor as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that said side-by-side tile elements (11) also on their

underside form service compartments (22).
An industrial floor as claimed in claim 5, characterised
in that said underside service compartments (22) are closable by

false ceiling elements (23) forming a flat soffit.
An industrial floor as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that trapdoor elements can be positioned at some of said

apertures.
An industrial floor as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the height of said tile elements (11) and

beam (20) can vary from 25 to 125 cm without changing the constant
thickness of the ribs, to hence leave a ceiling service

compartment of always constant width.
A multi-storey industrial structure formed from a series

of floors in accordance with the preceding claims, characterised
by comprising columns having their capital totally contained

within the floor thickness, to achieve a frame with continuity
between beam and capital and between beam and floor.
