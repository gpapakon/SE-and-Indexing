Sliding door and device controlling the opening and 
closing of said door (20) sliding horizontally in a vehicle, the 

sliding door being subject at the beginning of opening and at the 
end of closure to a double movement, the door being completed, 

if desired, by a lock (50), this device comprising a horizontal 
worm (32) held so that it is able to rotate inside a rail (34) 

fixed against the inside face of the bodywork above or below the 
door, this worm at one end being engaged in the tapped hole of 

a carriage (36) able to move in translation inside this same rail 
and at the other end being able to be rotated by a rotary 

electric motor (30), as well as connection means connecting the 
carriage (36) to the door (20), characterised in that the 

connection means are constituted by a single connecting rod (38) 
whereof one end is attached directly to the carriage (36) and the 

other end to the door (20), a single connecting rod (38) whereof 
the longitudinal axis has an angle less than 25Â° with that of the 

worm. 
Sliding door and device according to Claim 1, whereof the 
beginning of the opening of the door is accompanied by a 

transverse translation of at least part of this door towards the 
outside, characterised in that the connecting rod (38) is 

connected to an arm (39) oriented towards the inside of the pre-existing 
vehicle or attached to the door. 
Sliding door and device according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the inner arm (39) supports a pivot (37) 

or roller (37') sliding in a horizontal guide rail (27) fixed to 
the top of the door (20) against the bodywork, the rail (34) 

containing the worm (32) and the carriage (36) being fixed in the 
horizontal plane in parallel against the side face of the guide 

rail (27) remote from that facing the door. 
Sliding door and device according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the pitch of the screw thread of  

 
the worm (32) is comprised between 10 and 15 millimetres and in 

that this worm rotates at a speed of between 2000 and 4000 
revolutions/minute. 
Sliding door and device according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the worm (32) is made from steel 

sold under the trade name INOX, which is a registered Trade Mark 
and that synthetic material is moulded over the carriage (36) 

around a nut, itself made from synthetic material sold under the 
trade name TEFLON, which is a registered Trade Mark. 
Sliding door and device according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the connecting rod (38) is a gas-operated 

shock-absorber and/or comprises springs. 
Sliding door and device according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that, when present, the lock (50) of the 

sliding door (20) is actuated by an electromagnet (44) directly, 
or at the level of a reversing lever (48) of a control rod (41) 

connected to a handle (53) outside or inside the door. 
Sliding door and device according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that the lock (50) of the sliding door (20) 

is actuated by a pair of electric linear actuators disposed on 
either side in the vertical plane of a control rod (55 ) connected 

to a handle (53) outside or inside the door, the rod being 
connected to the actuators symmetrically by a cable (47) or a 

pair of connecting rods. 
Sliding door and device according to one of Claims 7 or 
8, characterised in that the supply of electrical current to the 

electromagnet (44) or electric linear actuators (45) from an 
electrical source (40) of the vehicle takes place, between the 

door and the bodywork, through the intermediary of elastically 
movable lugs (49) coming into contact with corresponding 

contacts.
