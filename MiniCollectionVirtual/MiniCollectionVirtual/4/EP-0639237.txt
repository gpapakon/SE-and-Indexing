<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dyes, their preparation and use in the 
coloration of substrates. Over the years there have been many different dyes and dyeing 
methods invented for textile materials. Reactive dyes, direct dyes, vat dyes and 
their use are well known in dyestuff art. Reactive dyes are generally water-soluble 
and contain a labile or reactive atom or group which may react with hydroxy 
groups found in cellulose to form a dye-cellulose covalent bond. Direct dyes 
generally have low water-solubility and contain a planar region which provide a 
high affinity for cotton by physical absorption. Insoluble vat dyes are applied to 
cellulosic fibres by reduction to their water-soluble leuco form, application to the 
fibre, followed by oxidation back to the original water-insoluble form. Insoluble 
disperse dyes are also known which require expensive grinding and dispersing 
agents. These dispersing agents can cause foaming during dyeing and must be 
carefully disposed of afterwards. Dyes containing olefinic groups which can be 
polymerised using a free radical initiator have also been described, but these have 
not been commercially successful, possibly because of poor technical performance 
and the inconvenient need for free radical generators. The dyes of the present invention contain nucleophilic and 
electrophilic groups which enable molecules of the dye to join together when an 
aqueous solution of the dye is heated and/or basified. In this way the dye's 
molecular weight increases, its water solubility can decrease, and its affinity for 
any textile materials present may be increased, leading to high levels of exhaustion 
of the dye from the dyebath, good fixation to textiles and good wash-fastness 
properties for textiles dyed therewith. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided 
a water-soluble dye comprising molecules which contain a nucleophilic group and 
an electrophilic group characterised in that the molecules are capable of joining 
together by formation of a covalent bond between the nucleophilic group of one 
molecule and the electrophilic group of another molecule when the dye is heated 
or basified.  
 Embodiments of the present invention and terms used are illustrated 
by reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Fig. 1is a flow chart showing schematically how dye molecules are joined 
together when heated or basified; and Fig. 2is a flow chart showing how several dye molecules containing specific 
nucleophilic and electrophilic groups are
