<ABSTRACT>
A connecting device having a plug element and a socket element. The socket element has an insertion opening, into which the plug element can be inserted. The plug element has a base member and a rotary head, mounted on the front side thereof, which rotary head can be rotated against a spring force from a rest position to an insertion position and, after having been inserted into the insertion opening over a certain depth, can resume the rest position. This involves portions of the rotary head engaging in recesses in the socket element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a connecting device comprising a 
plug element and a socket element which can be coupled thereto. Such connecting devices are known in various embodiments. 
In this connection, reference can be made to the plugs and 
sockets conventional for connecting electric cords. Another 
example is constituted by the known connectors for hoses. A drawback of these known coupling devices is that they can 
take only little tensile force. If the known devices were of such design that some tensile 
force could indeed be taken, a simple, easy operation would no 
longer be possible. As a consequence, the known plug-socket 
combinations have only a limited field of application. This is also true for the connecting device disclosed in 
US-A-3790914, which connecting device comprises a plug element 
and a socket element which can be coupled thereto, the socket 
element being provided with an insertion opening into which at 
least the front portion of the plug element can be inserted, 
wherein the plug element comprises a base member and a rotary 
head, mounted on the base member for rotation relative to the 
base member about a rotary shaft which extends in the direction 
of insertion, wherein said rotary head has a first rotational 
position in which the plug element cannot be inserted into or 
removed from the socket element and a second rotational position 
in which the plug element can be inserted into or removed from 
the socket element, and wherein means are provided for rotating 
the rotary head. The known connecting device has a base element of dielectric 
material provided on a front face with three 
electrically conducting prongs. The ground prong has a 
bifurcated or split outer wall in which lies a rotatable cam 
rod, which with an L-shaped end portion extends through the base  
 
element into a cam slot formed in a rotatable element for 
rotating the cam rod with respect to its longitudinal axis. The 
cam rod has at its other end portion a flat locking head, which 
when rotated in one direction expands the wall of said ground 
prong to prevent withdrawal of the ground prong from the 
corresponding ground prong receiving bush of a power outlet, 
thereby preventing withdrawal of the plug from the power outlet 
or socket. The known device relies solely on frictional forces to 
prevent unwanted disconnection of the plug element and the 
socket element. Such frictional forces however may rapidly 
diminish by wear of the mechanical components, and can only 
resist relatively small tensile
