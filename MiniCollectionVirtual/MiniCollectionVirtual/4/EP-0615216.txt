<ABSTRACT>
A coin packaging apparatus is capable of saving the 
labor of operations for modifying coin data and totally 

managing coin data operating data. The coin packaging 
apparatus has a memory card driver (146) for reading and 

writing the coin data and writing the operating data in a 
memory card and a control unit (132) for calculating a 

passage width and height of a coin passage and a inner 
diameter of a coin accumulating unit by use of the coin 

data read from the memory card driver. The coin packaging 
apparatus also has a kind-of-coin designating unit (134) 

for designating a kind of coin to be processed, a coin 
passage width adjusting unit (141) for adjusting the 

passage width in a non-stage manner, a coin passage height 
adjusting unit (142) for adjusting the coin passage in the 

non-stage manner and a coin accumulating unit inner 
diameter adjusting unit (142) for adjusting the inner 

diameter of the coin accumulating unit in the non-stage 
manner. The system for managing the coin packaging apparatus 

has the above-mentioned coin packaging apparatus and 
a data recording unit (170) including an external data 

medium driving unit (171) and control unit (172) therefor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a coin
packaging apparatus and, more particularly, to a coin
packaging machine which automatically adjust width and
height of a coin passage for processing such as selecting
and counting coins and also inner diameter of a coin
accumulating unit. The present invention further relates
to a coin packaging apparatus managing system for totally
storing and managing data relative to the processing by the
coin packaging apparatus.For instance, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication
(Kokai) No.59-121491(1984) discloses a known coin packaging
machine for accumulating a predetermined number of coins
and packaging the coins with a sheet of wrapping paper.The packaging machine disclosed in the same Patent
Laid-Open Publication is constructed as follows. The coins
are sent one by one out of a rotary disk and conveyed on
a coin passage. Performed on this passage are processes
such as selecting the coins having a small diameter,
counting the coins to be packaged and stopping the operation.
At the same time, the coins are transferred into a
coin accumulating unit provided at the terminal of the coin
passage, wherein a predetermined number of coins are
accumulated. After finishing the accumulation thereof, the
accumulated coins are moved to a packaging unit and
packaged with a sheet of wrapping paper.The width and height of the above coin passage and the
inner diameter of the coin accumulating unit are adjustable
corresponding to kinds of the coins for the purpose of
processing the coins having different diameters and thicknesses.More specifically, the adjustment of the coin passage 
width involves the following steps. A movable passage
member movable in a crosswise direction of the coin passage
among members constituting the coin passage is brought into
contact with a polygonal cam. One of cam surfaces is
selected by manually rotationally operating a kind-of-coin
setting handle. The movable passage member is moved to a
position corresponding to a diameter of the processed coin
with the aid of this cam surface, thus adjusting the coin
passage width.Further, the adjustment of the coin passage height is
done as follows. A thickness regulating member regulates
the coins sent from the rotary disk in a one-layer state.
Conveyor belts convey the coins while being press-fitted
to the upper surface of the coin. The thickness regulating
member and the conveyor belts are supported on a movable
frame movable up and down. The thickness regulating member
and the conveyor belts are moved up
