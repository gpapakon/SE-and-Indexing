<ABSTRACT>
Tooth assemblies having a tip with ears extending rearwardly therefrom to mate with corresponding slots in an adapter are normally utilized in order to aid in the transfer of forces from the tip to the adapter. In the subject arrangement, a tip (12) includes a pair of opposed ears (32, 34) each having a pair of opposed edge surfaces (40, 42) that are angled one relative to the other. The pair of opposed ears (32, 34) of the tip (12) mates with a pair of corresponding opposed slots (54, 56) defined by the adapter (14). The pair of opposed slots (54, 56) in the adapter (14) likewise has a pair of opposed edge surfaces (60, 62) angled with respect to one another and are in confronting mating relationships with the pair of opposed edge surfaces (40, 42) of the pair of opposed ears (32, 34). This inhibits any outward movement of the pair of opposed ears (32, 34) with respect to the adapter (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a tooth
assembly having a tip, an adapter and a retaining
mechanism and more particularly to the interface of
the tip with the adapter.Many known tip assemblies include a tip and
an adapter wherein the tip has rearwardly extending
ears and the adapter has corresponding slots to
receive the ears of the tip. Even though the ears aid
in the control of forces being subjected to the tip by
transferring such forces to the adapter, various type
of loads have a tendency to bend the ears of the tip
outwardly, thus, subjecting the ears to breakage.The present invention is directed to
overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth
above.
U.S. Patent 2,689,419 issued to A. W. Daniels et al on September 21, 1954
depicts an excavating tooth with tapered interally projecting lugs that fit into
tapered recesses in the replaceable point.In one aspect of the present invention, a
tooth assembly is provided having a tip, an adapter,
and a retainer assembly. A central vertical longitudinal plane is
defined through the center of the tip and the center
of the adapter. A pair of vertical aligned openings and a
cavity are defined in the rearward end portion of the
tip. A pair of opposed ears extend rearwardly
adjacent the opening of the cavity and each ear of the
pair of ears has a pair of opposed side surfaces and a
pair of opposed edge surfaces. The edge surfaces of
each of the ears are angled, one relative to the
other, so that the side surface nearest the
longitudinal plane has a width greater than the width 
of the opposed side surface. The adapter has a nose
portion operative to mate with the cavity of the tip
and defines a pin opening which can be aligned with the aligned opening of the tip.
A pair of opposed slots
is defined in the adapter adjacent the nose portion.
Each slot of the pair of slots has a side surface
oriented substantially parallel with the longitudinal
plane and a pair of opposed edge surfaces. The edge
surfaces are angled one relative to the other so that
the edge surfaces are spaced farthest apart at the
intersection of the edge surfaces with the side
surface. The edge surfaces of the pair of ears, upon
assembly, are in closely spaced relation with the edge
surfaces of the respective slots of the adapter.In another aspect of the present invention,
a tip is provided and adapted for connection to an
adapter. The tip defines a pair of vertical aligned openings,
a cavity disposed between the respective openings of
the pair of openings and a central vertical
