<ABSTRACT>
In a shut-off valve which is pneumatically actuable by means of a piston/cylinder arrangement, the cylinder is divided by a piston into a first and a second subchamber. A volume displacement element arranged in the first subchamber brings about a rapid pressure drop in this subchamber during switching, thus avoiding damage to the shut-off valve. Since the full control pressure is available at the beginning of the switching operation, just as before it, the volume displacement element does not cause any increase in the switching time of the shut-off valve.

<CLAIMS>
A shut-off valve (10), which can be pneumatically 
operated by a piston/cylinder arrangement (12, 14), 

having an inlet and outlet duct (22, 24) for a valve 
housing (25) containing medium, the passage (26) of which 

at the valve seat (20) is closed or opened by a sealing 
element (18), which is operated by the piston (14), which 

is displaceably guided in the cylinder (12) and divides 
the cylinder (12) into a first (34) and a second sub-chamber 

(36), via a piston rod (16) and in its closed 
position is loaded by the medium against the valve seat 

(20), wherein the piston (14) has a cavity (32) open to 
the first sub-chamber (34), into which a volume 

displacement element (48) in the first sub-chamber (34) 
extends, which to open the sealing element (18) has a 

higher pressure in comparison with the second sub-chamber 
(36), and with the shut-off valve (10) closed at least 

considerably reduces the clearance volume of the first 
sub-chamber (34), wherein the volume displacement element 

(48) has radially extending ribs (483), the contour of 
which substantially corresponds to the contour of the 

adjacent wall region of the cavity (32), and wherein the 
sealing element (18) is moved by controlling the pressure 

at least in the first sub-chamber (34). 
A shut-off valve according to Claim 1, wherein the volume 
displacement element (48) is disposed coaxially to the 

piston rod (16). 
A shut-off valve according to one of the preceding 
Claims, wherein the regions of the volume displacement 

element (48) which abut the wall limiting the first sub-chamber 
(34) have, on their side faced away from the  

 
piston (14), a contour which has a complementary 

construction to the contour of this wall. 
A shut-off valve according to one of the preceding 
Claims, wherein the volume displacement element (48) is 

prevented from making a movement relative to the cylinder 
(12) in the first sub-chamber (34). 
A shut-off valve having a connection (38, 40) for a 
pneumatic control medium for the first and/or second sub-chamber 

(34, 36) according to one of the preceding 
claims, wherein a choke (39) is provided between the 

first sub-chamber (34) and the connection (38) and/or a 
choke (41) is provided between the second sub-chamber 

(36) and the connection (40).
