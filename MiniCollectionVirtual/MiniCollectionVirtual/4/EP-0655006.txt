<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a cannula, as illustrated in the figure 3, whose wall (2) is bent, at the tip (4), in towards the longitudinal axis (6) of the needle. The needle tip is ground to give a basic ground zone (8) and two facets, the whole interface between the basic zone and the inside surface of the bore being rounded so that they are blunt.
