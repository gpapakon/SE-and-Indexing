<ABSTRACT>
An adsorbent material typically comprising an acid-treated three-layer mineral, such as a smectite clay mineral, having a silica content, expressed as SiO2, of from 90 % to 99.5 % by dry weight, an average pore diameter of 50 to 100 Angstroms, a non-water leachable aluminium content, expressed as Al2O3, of at least 0.05 % and a Hedley acidity of from 0.01 % to 4 % is provided. The adsorbent may be used to improve the haze resistance of aqueous beverages such as beers, wines, fruit extracts or fruit extract-containing beverages.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new or improved adsorbent 
material based on acid-treated three layer minerals and to 
the use of the adsorbent for the clarification of aqueous 
liquids. The term "adsorbent" is used without intention to 
limit to any particular mechanism by which materials may be 
taken into or onto a body of material. Many weakly or moderately acidic aqueous liquids 
intended for consumption, for example beers, wines, 
beverages containing fruit extracts and the like are subject 
under certain conditions to a lack of optical clarity which 
can be a disincentive to a prospective purchaser. An 
example of this is the tendency for some beers to develop a 
haze comprising proteinaceous materials or complexes thereof 
with, for example, tannins after storage under relatively 
chilled conditions or when dispensed in the chilled state. 
Most beer production processes include a post-conditioning 
filtration stage intended to reduce the content of 
proteinaceous material in the final product and thereby 
reduce the tendency of the beer to develop chill-haze. The 
fact that the problem can persist indicates that this 
filtration step could well be improved. By moderately 
acidic liquid is meant a liquid having a pKa of at least 
about 3. 
US-A-3,328,124 discloses the production of particulate 
materials by the acid-treatment under pressure of hydrous 
magnesium silicates. Such materials have pore dimensions 
of 22 to 45 Angstroms and this gives a distinctive 
selective power of sorption. 
GB-B-1,181,435 discloses the production of adsorbents for 
treating fermented or fermentable liquors by the acid 
treatment of a montmorillonite at high pressure and 
temperature to give a content of SiO₂ of 80 to 90%. There 
is no disclosure of the pore diameter of the adsorbents. United States Patent Specification No. 3901826 
discloses an adsorbent intended for the treatment of weakly 
acidic aqueous solutions comprising a montmorillonite 
mineral which has been treated with a mineral acid, followed  
 
by washing, until its SiO₂ content has reached at least 80% 
by weight and until its crystal lattice has become X-ray 
amorphous. This product is to be used to treat aqueous 
acidic liquids without contaminating the liquids appreciably 
with iron or aluminium ions and is disclosed to have a 
stabilising effect against protein. According to the present invention there is provided an 
adsorbent suitable for the treatment of weakly or moderately 
acidic aqueous liquids such as beers, wines, fruit extracts 
or
