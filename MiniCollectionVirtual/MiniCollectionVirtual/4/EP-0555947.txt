<ABSTRACT>
A continuous method for the surface treatment of 
solid particles comprises feeding a powder mixture which 

consists of solid particles of a given substance and 
solid particles of another substance into one of a 

plurality of impact chambers (29) in communication with one 
another and equipped with a rotating disc having impact 

pins and also with an impingement ring (7), subjecting the 
mixture to an impact striking action, separating an air 

stream produced by that action from the powder mixture 
and discharging it continuously from the impact chamber, 

repeating the impact action while allowing the powder 
mixture to reside temporarily in the impact chamber, and 

then causing the mixture to move, in succession, to the 
next chamber and so forth. An apparatus for the surface 

treatment comprises a plurality of rotating discs each 
fitted with a plurality of impact pins, a shaft (1) on which 

the discs are fixedly mounted in spaced relationship, an 
impingement ring (7) surrounding the discs to form an impact 

space, and partition plates (8) disposed between the rotating 
discs to define a plurality of impact chambers, each 

partition plate being formed with a passageway close to 
the shaft to establish communication between the two 

adjacent impact chambers that it partitions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
surface treatment of solid particles and an apparatus 
therefor. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
method and an apparatus for continuously performing the 
surface treatment of solid particles by either embedding 
finer particles of a different material in or depositing 
them on base particles. The invention further relates to 
a method of continuously performing the surface treatment 
of solid particles which comprises solidly depositing 
finer particles of another material on base particles and 
softening or melting a part or whole of the deposited 
particles so as to fix them in the form of a film onto 
the surfaces of the individual solid particles and 
relates also to an apparatus therefor. Solid particles have hitherto been subjected to 
various surface treatments generally to avoid their 
caking, discoloration or changes of properties; improve 
their dispersibility, fluidity, catalytic effect, magnetic 
properties, and resistance to light; or to control  
 
digestion or absorption properties. Broadly, surface treatments of solid particles can 
be classified into the following categories that depend 
on: (1) coating techniques; (2) topochemical processes, 
or scientific treatments using surface functional groups 
of particles; (3) mechano-chemical reactions that make 
the most of active sites formed on particle surfaces by 
mechanical action; (4) encapsulation; (5) high energies, 
e.g., ultraviolet rays, radiant rays, and plasma beam; 
and (6) precipitation reaction. Useful among these methods is a technical variation 
of the encapsulation (4), known as "impingement in a 
high-speed air stream" (proposed, e.g., by JP-A-62083029. 
It is 
one way of obtaining a functional composite powder 
material by the surface treatment of given solid 
particles (hereinafter called "base particles"). The 
method fixes finer solid particles of a dissimilar 
substance (hereinafter called "sub-particles") onto the 
surfaces of the base particles. To be more precise, the method uses an apparatus 
wherein a rotating disc fitted with hammer- or blade-type 
impact pins along the periphery thereof is disposed in an 
impact chamber and is surrounded by an impingement ring 
along the outermost circumferential track of the rotating  
 
disc with a given clearance therebetween. The method 
comprises conducting an air stream that has resulted from 
the revolution of the impact pins through a circulating 
passageway extending from a part of the impingement ring 
to

A continuous method for the surface treatment of 
solid particles which comprises feeding a powder mixture 

which consists of solid particles of a given substance 
and solid particles of another substance into one of a 

plurality of impact chambers (29a - c)in communication with one 
another and equipped with a rotating disc (2a - c) carrying impact 

pins (6) and also with an impingement ring (7a - c), subjecting the 
mixture to an impact striking action, separating an air 

stream produced by that action from the powder mixture 
and discharging it continuously from the impact chamber, 

repeating the impact action while allowing the powder 
mixture to reside temporarily in the impact chamber, and 

then causing the mixture to move, in succession, to the 
next chamber and so forth.

particles and finer solid particles of a dissimilar substance 

are used and the finer particles are embedded in 
or secured to the surfaces of the solid particles while 

being deposited or after having been deposited thereon. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein solid 
particles and finer solid particles of a dissimilar substance 

are used and, while the finer particles are being 
deposited or after having been deposited on the solid 

particles, the impact striking action is repeated so that  
 

the generated thermal energy softens and melts all or a part of the 
adjacent finer particles on the individual solid particles to fuse 

together and form a film sticking fast to the solid particles.

between the two adjacent impact chambers partitioned thereby and allowing 
to that mixture from one impact chamber to the next and that stop 

valves (14a - c) are installed, each between the adjacent impact
