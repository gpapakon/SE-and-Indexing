<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to soil compacting methods
and devices and, more particularly, to a method and a
device for increasing the bearing capacity of soil.Structural foundations are designed to transmit the
weight of the structure to the underlying soil or rock,
which serves as a basic supporting member. The
foundation must be essentially unyielding, since one of
the chief requirements is the minimization or the
elimination of settlement due to yielding of the soil
under applied loads.Structural foundations are of two main types,
namely, spread foundations and pilings.A spread foundation is a structural element designed
to distribute a concentrated load to reduce the
distributed pressure to an allowable use which can safely
be supported by the soil thereunder.When the soil at or below the level where the spread
foundation would normally be placed is unsuitable in some
respect for a spread-foundation design, then the weight
of the structure must in some manner be transferred to
the soil at greater depths or to rock. Bearing piles or
caissons are used for this purpose. Such piles can be
friction piles, which are supported through skin
friction, Gow caisson piles or end bearing piles, which
rely on the firmness and strength of hard soil or rock
below the surface of the soil.Spread foundations are preferable because they are
relatively inexpensive compared to piles. However, when the safe bearing capacity or bearing
value of the soil is less than the pressure applied to
the soil by the foundation, then the foundation must be
made of piles unless the soil can be stabilized. The
most popular way to stabilize the soil is through
compaction by vibrating devices or rollers. Further, by
compacting the soil consolidation occurs, which is the
removal of any excess water contained therein.Present methods of compacting loose grain soil can
increase the load-bearing capacity of the soil
substantially. However, under the present systems,
compacting soil requires extensive amounts of machinery
and a considerable amount of time. The same is true for
pile foundations. Also, these methods only compact the
soil in the vertical direction and very little compaction
or strength is achieved in the lateral direction.
Further, under present systems, determining the load-bearing
capacity of compacted soil is very difficult and
time consuming at best.NL-A-279 696, US-AS 225 269 and US-A-2 678 540 disclose various known
foundation structures upon which the present invention seeks to improve.Therefore, it is an object of our

(614) having a third end that is larger than a fourth end, said second end and said third 

end being substantially the same size whereby said second end attaches to said third
end, said first end attaches to said first section, and said fourth end is defined by the

said lower end of the said tapering segment and is positioned below said first end in
use, and said second end and third end are positioned above the plane (40) and said

fourth end is positioned below the plane (40) in use.
A bearing pier foundation (500) according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein said first
and second parts together define a first frusto-cone shaped surface (512) having a first

end larger than a second end and a second frusto-cone shaped surface (514) having a
