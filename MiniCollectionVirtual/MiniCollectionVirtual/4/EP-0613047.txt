<ABSTRACT>
A photographic assembly which comprises an opaque photographic base on 
which is coated at least one photographic emulsion layer, there being 

coated on the topmost emulsion layer a gelatin supercoat layer which 
comprises from 5 to 35% by weight of colourless polymer particles which 

have a glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least 40°C and have a 
particle size of not more than 90nm and have substantially the same 

refractive index as gelatin. 
The object of the coating is to produce a high gloss and reduce the 
haze.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic assemblies which after exposure 
and processing yield a black and white print. There is a constant desire to produce black and white prints in which 
the black areas exhibit a high black gloss and little or no haze. When black and white material after exposure and processing is infra-red 
dried a remarkable increase in black gloss is observed. However most 
black and white print material after processing is cold air or hot air 
dried. We have found a black and white material which after exposure 
and processing, followed by air drying exhibits a remarkable increase in 
black gloss and a diminution in the haze exhibited. This is obtained in 
a way not fully understood by incorporating a polymer latex having 
defined properties in the gelatin supercoat layer of the assembly. In the past photographic assemblies have been described for photographic 
assemblies which comprise polymer latexes of different properties in 
gelatin supercoat layer in order to overcome other disadvantages but not 
to increase air-dried black gloss. Such assemblies are described for 
example in British Patent Specification No 1228828, British Patent 
Specification 1384967 and in British Patent Specification 1401768 According to the present invention there is provided a photographic 
assembly which comprises an opaque photographic base on which is coated 
at least one photographic emulsion layer, there being coated on the 
topmost emulsion layer a gelatin supercoat layer which comprises from 5 
to 35% by weight of colourless polymer particles which have a glass 
transition temperature (T.g.) of at least 40°C and have a mean particle 
size of not more than 90nm and have substantially the same refractive  
 
index as gelatin. Preferably not more than 10% of the particles should 
be larger than 90nm. It is to be understood that the photographic assembly of the present 
invention relates to the prepared assembly ready for use. Thus the 
gelatin supercoat layer is a dried gelatin layer. Preferably the 
particle size of the polymer particles is less than 65nm. The coating 
weight of the supercoat layer is preferably from 2.0 to 3.0g/m² of 
binder (i.e. gelatin and latex). Preferably the T.g. of the polymer particles is at least 70°C. Dried gelatin has a refractive index of 1.5. Thus the polymer particles 
should have a refractive index between 1.3 and 1.7 but most preferably 
as close to 1.5 as possible. Examples of monomers and monomer mixtures which can be used to prepare 
the polymer particles for
