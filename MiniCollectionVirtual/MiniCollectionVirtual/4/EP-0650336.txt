<ABSTRACT>
In a stick (1) for dispensing a spreadable compound, especially an adhesive or deodorant, consisting of a cylindrical sleeve (2) with a closed base (4) in which, by means of a snap fastening (7), is inserted a stick (3) which can be rotated about its longitudinal axis, which takes the form of a threaded rod (9) projecting over virtually the entire length of the longitudinal axis (5) of the sleeve on one side and a manually operable knurled nut (10) outside the sleeve (2) on the other side of the snap fastening (7), and a cup-like piston (11) which is secured against rotation in the sleeve (2) with a cylindrical jacket component (12) having longitudinal grooves (12) or shoulders in its surface and can be moved along the longitudinal axis (5) of the sleeve via the threaded rod (9) engaging in a threaded through hole (16) in the piston (11), and a cap which can be pushed on the upper edge of the sleeve, a system is to be provided which makes it possible to remove the spreadable compound attached to the piston as well. This is achieved in that the piston (11) is designed in two parts and consists of the cylindrical jacket component (12) and a base plate (13) recessed thereinto, inserted to be secured against rotation and axial movement in relation to the jacket component (12) and provided, with the threaded through hole, in that there is a stop (26) on the inside of the upper sleeve edge preventing the jacket component (12) from emerging, and in that when the jacket component (12) encounters the stop (26) and on further turning of the knurled nut (10) in the piston projection direction, the axial movement security system in the jacket component (12) for the base plate (13) can be overcome and the base plate (13) can be guided in the jacket component (12) at least as far as the region of the upper face plane of the jacket component (12).

A stick (1) for applying a spreadable composition, more particularly an 
adhesive or deodorant stick, consisting of a cylindrical tube (2) with a 

continuous base (4) into which a pin (3) rotatable about its longitudinal axis 
is fitted by means of a snap-action joint (7), the pin (3) - which projects over 

substantially the entire longitudinal axis (5) of the tube - being in the form of 
a screwthreaded spindle (9) beyond one side of the snap-action joint (7) and 

in the form of a hand-operated knurled nut (10) beyond the other side of the 
snap-action joint (7) outside the tube (2); of a bowl-shaped piston (11) which 

is guided in fillets (15) or grooves in the inner wall of the tube by a cylindrical 
casing element (12) comprising longitudinal grooves (14) or longitudinal fillets 

in its outer surface and thus prevented from rotating in the tube (2) and which 
is designed for displacement along the longitudinal axis (5) of the tube by the 

screwthreaded spindle (9) engaging in a screwthreaded bore (16) extending 
throughout the piston (11); and of a cover cap designed to be pushed on over 

the upper rim of the tube, characterized in that the piston (11) is in two parts 
and consists of the cylindrical casing element (12) and of a baseplate element 

(13) formed with the screwthreaded bore (16) which is sunk into the casing 
element (12) and prevented from rotating and moving axially in relation 

thereto; in that a stop element (26) is formed on the inside of the upper rim 
(17) of the tube to prevent the casing element (13) from coming out; and in 

that, when the casing element (12) comes up against the stop element (26) 
and the knurled nut (10) is further rotated in the direction in which the piston 

advances, the axial displacement stop (18,24) in the casing element (12) for 
the baseplate element (13) is designed to be overcome to enable the 

baseplate element (13) - guided in the casing element (12) - to be displaced 
at least into the vicinity of the upper front edge plane of the casing element 

(12). 
A stick as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the casing element 
(12) has a first upper cylindrical region (12a) which bears at its outer surface -  

 
formed with the longitudinal grooves (14) or longitudinal fillets to stop the 

piston (11) from rotating - against the inner wall of the tube and which is 
provided on its inner wall with at least one encircling bead (18) forming the 

axial displacement stop of the baseplate element (13) or with correspondingly 
arranged segment cams; and in that the casing element (12) has a second 

lower cylindrical region (12b) of smaller diameter which is provided on its 
inner wall with longitudinal fillets (20) or longitudinal grooves that cooperate 

with longitudinal grooves (21) or longitudinal fillets formed on the outside of 
a hollow cylindrical part (22) of the baseplate element (13) to form the rotation 

stop of the baseplate element (13). 
A stick as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the baseplate 
element (13) consists of an annular disc (23) arranged for displacement in the 

first cylindrical region (12a) of the casing element (12) with a hollow cylinder 
(22) which is integrally formed along the central axis (5), which is let into the 

second cylindrical region (12b) of the casing element (12) and which 
comprises the full-length screwthreaded bore (16). 
A stick as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that, in the starting 
position, the annular disc (23) bears internally against a transitional wall 

region (24) between the upper cylindrical region (12a) and the lower 
cylindrical region (12b) of the casing element (12) and is held on its upper 

surface by the at least one bead (18) or the correspondingly arranged 
segment cams of the axial displacement stop. 
A stick as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

the stop element (26) is arranged below the upper rim of the tube and is in 
the form of an encircling bead or correspondingly arranged segment cams. 
A stick as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that, 
on contacting the stop element (26), the upper front edge plane of the casing 

element (12) projects into the upper front edge plane of the tube (2). 
A stick as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the starting region (27) at the bottom of the screwthreaded bore (16) widens  

 
conically in the baseplate element (13) and is adapted to the shaft (6) of the 

screwthreaded spindle (9).
