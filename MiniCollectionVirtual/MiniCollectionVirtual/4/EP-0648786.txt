<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for 
producing an α-olefin polymer comprising a metallocene, an 
organoaluminum compound, an ionizing ionic compound, and a 
Lewis base compound. The present invention also relates 
to a process for producing an α-olefin polymer employing 
the above catalyst. For polymerization of olefins, special active 
catalysts are known which comprise combination of a 
cyclopentadienyl derivative of a metal such as titanium, 
zirconium, and hafnium (Group 4B of Periodic Table) with 
aluminoxane. This type of catalyst is not used practically in 
commercial production of olefin polymers mainly because of 
the following disadvantages: the aluminoxane cannot 
readily be synthesized with high reproducibility, and 
therefore preparation of the catalyst and production of 
the polymers cannot be conducted with sufficient 
reproducibility; and aluminoxane is required to be used in 
a high ratio to the transition metal compound to achieve 
sufficient catalyst activity although the raw material of 
aluminoxane, e.g., trimethylaluminum, is expensive. To offset the disadvantages, ionic metallocene 
catalysts are reported. JP-A-3-207704 discloses an ionic 
metallocene compound prepared by reacting a metallocene  
 
compound with an ionizing ionic compound. WO92/01723 
discloses an α-olefin polymerization process employing a 
catalyst system prepared by reacting a halogenated 
metallocene compound with an organometallic compound and 
further bringing the product into contact with an ionizing 
ionic compound, the catalyst system having sufficient 
catalytic activity. EP-A-513 380 describes a catalyst comprising a transition 
metal compound, a compound capable of forming an ionic complex 
when reacted with a transition metal compound and an 
organoaluminum compound. The addition of a Lewis base compound 
as is described in this invention is not disclosed in 
this prior art. The catalyst system employing an ionizing ionic 
compound, which has a high initial activity, loses its 
activity with progress of polymerization, 
disadvantageously. It is the object of the present invention to 
provide a catalyst for polymerizing olefins exhibiting 
improved productivity of polymers. This object could be achieved on the basis of 
the finding that a catalyst prepared by reacting an 
ionic metallocene catalyst with a Lewis base compound 
has a stable catalytic species, and exhibits improved 
productivity of polymers without deterioration of the 
catalytic activity. The present invention provides a
