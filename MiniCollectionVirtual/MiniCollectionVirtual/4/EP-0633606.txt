<ABSTRACT>
The all epitaxial process starts with a high 
resistivity silicon substrate (10). Alternating layers 

(14-24) of silicon and silicon-germanium are epitaxially 
grown on the substrate under conditions which create a 

region with misfit dislocations. A low resistivity silicon 
layer (28) is then grown over the region. The material is 

inverted such that the high resistivity layer (10) can be 
used to form the base of the device. The thickness of the 

high resistivity layer is adjusted to equal the width of 
the base of the semiconductor device to be fabricated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor material 
particularly intended for use in manufacturing bipolar 
semiconductor devices such as high voltage fast switching 
rectifiers and an all epitaxial method for making same. The production of material for use in manufacturing 
semiconductor devices by epitaxial techniques and diffusion is 
well known. A process which employs an all epitaxial method is 
disclosed in copending European Patent Application 94301701.2 
filed 10th March, 1994 and entitled Multilayer Epitaxial 
Structure and Method for Fabricating Same. Moreover, it is 
known to employ epitaxial techniques to form depletion layers 
with silicon/silicon-germanium interfaces under conditions which 
result in regions of misfit dislocations to control the 
switching speed of the power semiconductor devices. In this 
regard, the reader is referred to U.S. Patent No. 5,097,308 and 
U.S. Patent No. 5,102,810, both issued to Ali Salih and entitled 
Method for Controlling The Switching Speed of Bipolar Power 
Devices. The present invention is particularly concerned with 
providing an improved process for making a semiconductor 
material using all epitaxial techniques, similar to that 
disclosed in the abovementioned Application No. 94301701.2 to 
form regions of misfit dislocations similar to those disclosed 
in the above patents. The material is economical to produce and 
particularly well suited for fabrication of high voltage, fast 
switching rectifiers rated over 1000 volts with high yields and 
high reliability. By combining several techniques in which a method is  
 
achieved in which the epitaxial material is inverted after 
formation such that what started as the substrate becomes 
the structure in which the base of the device is formed. The process starts with a high resistivity substrate. 
The substrate is preferably Neutron Transmutation Doped 
silicon or Float Zone silicon. The surface of the high 
resistivity layer is prepared by slicing, diamond grinding 
and, if necessary etching. Alternating layers of 
substantially germanium free silicon and silicon containing 
germanium are epitaxially grown under conditions suitable 
to create regions of misfit dislocations. The misfit 
dislocations function to control switching speed of the 
device to be formed. A low resistivity layer is grown over 
the misfit dislocation region. The material is then 
inverted so that the low resistivity layer takes the place 
of the substrate and the high resistivity layer takes the 
place of the epi layer
