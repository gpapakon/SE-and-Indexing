<ABSTRACT>
A surgical instrument consisting of three concentric tubes (11, 12, 13), with the outer and inner tubes made of electrical current conducting material which are in turn connected to a bipolar current generator. When the tips (14, 15) of such tubes are placed against tissue a current will flow therebetween and cauterize such tissue. To prevent short circuiting between the two conductive tips the third or middle tube constitutes an insulator (18). A suction tube (22) equipped with a suction regulator is integral with the instrument and has open communication with the current conductive tips which are designed to be longitudinally separated by an open slot that allows continuous air flow therebetween and into the suction tube during the surgical procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgical instrument 
having an evacuating system for drawing off liquids, tissue 
and plumes from the surgical field. The instrument provides 
a cauterizing tip consisting of insulated current conductive 
tube ends, in open communication with a suction tube that can 
duplicate the selected relative degree or magnitude of 
suction during the surgical procedure. Such an instrument is known 
from US-A-4832048. The instrument of this invention is particularly 
useful in laser surgery with the cauterizing tips used as a 
tissue retractor for the laser surgical field. The evacuation 
system will remove all laser plumes during such operation. Conventional suction surgical instruments employ 
tubular suction shafts of metal which are costly to produce. 
In such instruments the electrical conductivity of the 
metallic suction shafts serve to connect the same to a source 
of high frequency current used for the purpose of cauterizing 
the tissue. In these prior devices the tissue becomes 
cauterized and coagulated not only at the desired location in 
the operating area but also deeper within the tissue. The 
previous suction cautery devices are "monopolar" with a 
distant grounding plate. This allows the current to flow 
through the tip to the tissues to deeper levels since the 
current flows from the tip to the grounding plate. It is the purpose of the present invention to obviate 
the aforementioned difficulties by providing a regulated 
suction surgical instrument which will remain unobstructed  
 
when employed as a cauterizing instrument, and provide a more 
controlled cauterizing current which flows between the 
closely spaced tips. The preferred embodiment of the present invention 
provides a suctioned cauterizing instrument that is simple in 
manufacture, economical and highly effective in use. The instrument consists of a cauterizing tip in open 
communication with a disposable suction tube. The 
cauterizing tip is constructed from three concentric tubes 
with the outer and inner tubes made from electrical current 
conducting material. These tubes are in turn connected to a 
bipolar current generator. The middle tube functions as an 
insulator preventing electrical short circuiting between the 
outer and inner conducting tubes. To assure continuous 
suctioned air flow within the cauterizing tip the inner and 
outer tubes are arranged so as to provide an open slot 
therebetween. This open slot prevents clogging by any 
retracted and cauterized tissue and allows fluid and
