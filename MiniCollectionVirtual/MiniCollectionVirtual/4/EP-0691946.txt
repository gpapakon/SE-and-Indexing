<ABSTRACT>
A process for clarifying an alkoxylated product mixture produced using a calcium-based catalyst wherein the product mixture is heated to a temperature of from about 80  DEG C to about 175  DEG C to produce a filtration feed, the filtration feed being passed through a filter medium comprising material possessing polar groups to produce a clarified filtrate, the filtration feed being passed through the filter medium within about 5 days of being prepared, the filtration feed being passed through the filter medium until the desired degree of clarification is obtained, the temperature of the clarified filtrate being less than about 30  DEG C but above the pour point of the clarified filtrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR CLARIFYING ALKOXYLATED ALCOHOLSBackground of the InventionField of the InventionThe present invention relates to the production of alkoxylated alcohols and, more particularly, to the clarification of an alkoxylated alcohol mixture produced using a calcium-based catalyst system.Description of the Prior ArtAlkoxylated alcohols, e.g., ethoxylated alcohols, are well known and findwide use in a variety of products such as, for example, surfactants. Typically, these alkoxylated alcohols, which can be considered alkylene oxide adducts of alcohols, are prepared by an addition or alkoxylation reaction in which an alkylene oxide, such as ethylene oxide, is reacted under suitable conditions with an alcohol, generally a long chain, fatty alcohol. In particular, ethylene oxide adducts of aliphatic alcohols and substituted phenols having from about 8 to 20 carbon atoms, have found widespread utility as non-ionic detergent components of cleaning formulations for use in industry and in the home.In recent years, there has been an emphasis on producing alkoxylated alcohols that have a narrow homolog distribution, such alkoxylated alcohols being commonly referred to as peaked alkoxylated alcohols. In general, due to an increased understanding of the properties to be provided by alkoxylated alcohols, greater demands have been placed on tailoring the manufacture of the alkoxylated alcohols to enhance the properties. Accordingly, efforts have been expended to provide alkoxylated products in which the distribution of the reacted alkoxide units per mole of alcohol is limited to a range in which the sought properties are enhanced. 

 U.S. Patent Nos. 4,820,673 and 4,835,321 disclose catalysts and processes for producing peaked alkoxylated alcohols. In the processes disclosed in both of the aforementioned patents, both of which are incorporated herein by reference, a calcium-based catalyst system is employed, i.e., the catalyst employs a calcium compound such as calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, or the like.While the processes using the calcium-based catalysts disclosed in the aforementioned patents produce alkoxylated alcohols having a narrow distribution of the alkoxylation species, i.e., peaked alkoxylated alcohols, the product mixture containing the alkoxylated alcohols contain undissolved solids, primarily calcium- based in nature, that impart a haze or cloudiness to the product mixture. Not only is the haze in the product mixture undesirable from an aesthetic point of view, the undissolved solids responsible

wherein R is a hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to about 30 carbon atoms, n is 2 to 4, and x is an average and is from about 2 to about 20, to a temperature from about 80° C to about 175° C to produce a filtration feed; and passing said filtration feed through a filter medium comprising a material possessing polar groups to produce a clarified filtrate, said filtration feed being passed through said filter medium within about 5 days of being prepared, said filtration feed being passed through said filter medium until the desired degree of clarification is obtained, the temperature of said filtrate at the end of filtration being less than about 30° C but above the pour point of the filtrate.
2. The process of Claim 1 wherein the alkoxylated alcohol product mixture is heated to a temperature of from about 90° C to about 120° C to produce said filtration feed.
3. The process of Claim 1 wherein said filter medium comprises cotton.
4. The process of Claim 1 wherein said filter medium is in the form of a filament formed into a spiral-wound cartridge filter. 


 5. The process of Claim 1 wherein said filtration feed is passed through said filter medium within about 2 days of being prepared.
6. The process of Claim 1 wherein the filtration feed is at a temperature of less than about 30° C prior to filtration.
7. The process of Claim 1 wherein the filtration feed is cooled during filtration.
8. The process of Claim 4 wherein said filter has a micron rating of from about 0.1 to about 20.0 microns.
9. The process of Claim 4 wherein said filter has a micron rating of from about 0.5 to about 5.0 microns.
10. The process of Claim 1 wherein said filter medium is regenerated by passing clarified filtrate through said filter medium at a temperature of from about 60° C to about 100° C.
11. The process of Claim 1 wherein said filter medium is regenerated by passing filtration feed through said filter medium at a temperature of from about 60°
C to about 100° C.
