<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous resin dispersion for a heat-sensitive recording 
material is disclosed. The aqueous resin dispersion is obtained 

by the use of polyvinyl alcohol as an emulsifier and the use 
of two steps of polymerization. In the first step of polymerization, 

a polymeric monomer composition A is polymerized, 
composition A containing polymeric multi-functional monomers 

which constitute 15% by weight or more of the total weight of 
the polymeric monomers used for the first step. And, in the 

second step, a polymeric monomer composition B is polymerized, 
The invention also discloses a heat-sensitive recording material 

using such an aqueous resin dispersion as a color-developing 
layer or a protective coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a aqueous resin
dispersion for a heat-sensitive recording material and to a
heat-sensitive recording material using the same.These days, a heat-sensitive recording material having a
dyestuff-type heat-sensitive color-developing layer obtained by
a combination of a leuco dye and a phenolic acidic substance is
widely used for printing paper of various thermal printers such
as facsimiles, medical printing, POS (point of sales system),
handy terminals, ticket issuing system, measuring instruments,
etc.In view of the above background, various proposals have
been made concerning a binder resin for a heat-sensitive
recording material and a resin for forming a protective coating.
Polyvinyl alcohol is now generally used as a heat-sensitive recording
material resin. It is used together with a considerable
amount of pigments, such as calcium carbonate, kaolin, with a
view to improving sticking resistance, and consequently, it has
defects relating to characteristics of transparency, color-developing,
water resistance, plasticizer resistance, and the 
like, particularly when polyvinyl alcohol is used for a
protective coating. Also, even though the concentration of
polyvinyl alcohol is low, the viscosity thereof is still high,
and therefore, it does not have good drying and coating
characteristics, thus inhibiting more speedy coating and
resulting in poor productivity.In order to solve the above various problems, a heat-sensitive
recording material provided with a protective coating
containing a special type of crosslinked microfine particles was
already disclosed by the present inventor (United States Patent
No.5,256,619). In accordance with a wider variety of uses for a
heat-sensitive recording material, however, further improvement
of the characteristics of the above heat-sensitive recording
material is becoming increasingly demanded.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide an aqueous resin dispersion for a heat-sensitive recording
material which brings about a color-developing layer or a
protective coating with high performance, and also to provide a
heat-sensitive recording material including a color-developing
layer or a protective coating which excels in characteristics
such as stability of background, which means that the color-developing
layer of heat-sensitive recording material does not
change when the heat-sensitive material is made or with time
afterwards, water resistance, sticking resistance, print
color-developing, plasticizer resistance, and the
