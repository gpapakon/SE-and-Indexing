<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to detergent compositions for hard 
surfaces. Such compositions typically contain detergent surfactants, 
detergent builders, and/or solvents to accomplish their 
cleaning tasks. The use of hard surface cleaning compositions containing 
organic water-soluble synthetic detergents, solvents, and, optionally, 
detergent builders are known. However, such compositions 
need improved cleaning while maintaining good spotting/filming. An object of the present invention is to provide detergent 
compositions which provide excellent cleaning plus good spotting/filming. This invention relates to hard surface detergent compositions 
with excellent spotting/filming characteristics comprising 
nonionic detergent surfactant, either conventional surfactant 
containing a hydrocarbon hydrophobic group and polyethoxylate 
hydrophilic group, or propylene glycol/ethylene glycol block 
copolymer nonionic detergent surfactant, preferably in a surfactant 
mixture with a nonionic detergent surfactant having a conventional 
hydrocarbon hydrophobic group and a mixed propylene glycol/ethylene 
glycol hydrophilic group; polyalkoxylate polycarboxylate 
surfactant/builder containing a hydrophobic group, a 
polyalkoxylate moiety, and multiple carboxylate anionic groups, 
preferably of the type disclosed in U.S. Pats. Nos. 4,533,485; 
4,827,028; and 5,120,326, said patents being incorporated herein 
by reference; optional, but preferred, hydrophobic cleaning 
solvent; and optional suds control system preferably comprising 
fatty acid and synthetic anionic, preferably sulfonated and/or 
sulfated, detergent surfactant. The hard surface detergent composition, preferably aqueous, 
preferably comprises: (a) conventional nonionic detergent  
 
surfactant comprising a hydrocarbon hydrophobic group, preferably 
alkyl, and a polyethoxylate hydrophilic group to provide an HLB of 
from about 6 to about 18, preferably from about 8 to about 16; (b) 
alkyl polyalkoxylate polycarboxylate surfactant/builder; (c) 
optional hydrophobic solvent that provides a primary cleaning 
function, when present, is preferably at a level of less than 
about 6%; (d) optional, but preferred, suds control system, which 
preferably comprises a low level of fatty acid and synthetic 
anionic detergent surfactant; and (e) optional polycarboxylate 
detergent builder which is not (b); and (f) the balance typically 
being an aqueous solvent system and minor ingredients, preferably 
color and/or perfume, said composition having a pH of from about 9 
to
