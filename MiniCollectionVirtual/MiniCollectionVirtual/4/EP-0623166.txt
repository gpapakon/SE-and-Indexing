<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous, liquid hard surface detergent compositions contain zwitterionic and cationic detergent surfactants and monoethanolamine and/or other specific beta-aminoalkanols as solvents and/or buffers for improved spotting/filming and good cleaning. Some formulas do not contain large amounts of builders and are suitable for general purpose cleaning including cleaning of glass. Other formulas are concentrated and contain chelating agents (detergent builders) to improve stability of more dilute compositions prepared from the concentrated compositions. Some of the formulas, both dilute and concentrated, possess disinfectant properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to liquid detergent compositions for 
use in cleaning hard surfaces, and especially to disinfectant 
and/or concentrated compositions. Such compositions typically 
contain detergent surfactants, solvents, builders, etc. The use of solvents and organic water-soluble synthetic 
detergents at low levels for cleaning glass are known. Similar compositions are disclosed and claimed in copending 
U.S. Pat. Application Ser. No. 07/818,499*, filed Jan. 8, 1992, 
said patent application being a file wrapper continuation of U.S. 
Pat. Application Ser. No. 07/628,067, filed Dec. 21, 1990, by 
Daniel W. Michael, entitled LIQUID HARD SURFACE DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS 
CONTAINING ZWITTERIONIC AND DETERGENT SURFACTANTS AND 
MONOETHANOLAMINE AND/OR BETA-AMINOALKANOL. General purpose household cleaning compositions for hard 
surfaces such as metal, glass, ceramic, plastic and linoleum 
surfaces, are commercially available in both powdered and liquid 
form. Liquid detergent compositions are disclosed in Australian 
Pat. Application 82/88168, filed Sept. 9, 1982, by The Procter & 
Gamble Company; U.K. Pat. Application GB 2,166,153A, filed 
Oct. 24, 1985, by The Procter & Gamble Company; and U.K. Pat. 
Application GB 2,160,887A, filed June 19, 1985, by Bristol-Myers 
Company. 
These liquid detergent compositions comprise 
certain organic solvents, surfactant, and optional builder and/or 
abrasive. The prior art, however, fails to teach, or recognize,  
 
the advantage of the specific surfactants and organic solvents/buffers 
disclosed hereinafter, in liquid hard surface cleaner 
formulations. Liquid cleaning compositions have the great advantage that 
they can be applied to hard surfaces in neat or concentrated form, 
where a relatively high level of surfactant material and organic 
solvent is delivered directly to the soil. Moreover, it is a 
rather more straightforward task to dilute high concentrations of 
surfactant from a liquid rather than a granular composition. Liquid cleaning compositions, and especially compositions 
prepared for cleaning glass, should have good spotting/filming 
properties. An object of the present invention is to provide detergent 
compositions which provide good glass cleaning without excessive 
filming and/or streaking. The present invention relates to an aqueous, liquid, hard 
surface detergent composition comprising: (a) zwitterionic detergent 
surfactant, containing a cationic group, preferably a quaternary 
ammonium group, and an anionic group, preferably a
