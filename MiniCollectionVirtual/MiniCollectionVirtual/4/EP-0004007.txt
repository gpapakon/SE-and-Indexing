<ABSTRACT>
1. Method for connecting circularly bent and straight, hollow profiled frame members of a multi-sheet-insulating glass comprising connecting the legs (D) of a circularly bent profiled frame member (A) to the legs of at least another circularly bent of straight profiled frame member within the straight area of a hollow profiled frame by a straight flat connector (C) for the manufacture of a closed hollow profiled frame, characterized in that the flat connector (C) is inserted into the profiled frame member up to a stop between the flat connector (C) and the profiled frame member (D) by elastically pressing together that part of its surface engaging those walls of the profiled member on which the sheets of the multi-sheet-insulating glass are laid upon and that thereafter that hollow profiled frame member is pushed over that part of the flat connector (C) extending out of the profiled frame member (D) similarly by elastically pressing together that part of the extending surface of the flat connector (C) which engages those walls of the profiled memeber on the outside of which the sheets of glass of the multi-sheet-insulating glass are laid down.
