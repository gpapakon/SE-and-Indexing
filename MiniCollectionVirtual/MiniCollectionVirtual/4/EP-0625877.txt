<ABSTRACT>
In a pulling over and lasting machine a heel rest arrangement (26) is provided, comprising a position-detecting device (linear potentiometer (52)) by which the actual position of the heel-engaging member (heel block (32)) can be monitored, comparator means being provided for comparing the value of the output of such device with a pre-set further value, representative of the desired heightwise position of the heel block (32). In response to a discrepancy arising between the two values, either a display (30) may indicate the discrepancy, in response to which the operator corrects the discrepancy, or powered means may be provided for automatically moving the heel block (32) to a corrected position. In another version, furthermore, locking means is provided which is released upon a discrepancy arising, allowing the operator to adjust the heightwise position of the heel block (32), whereafter the locking means (50) is automatically reapplied. The control is so organised that a cycle of operation cannot be initiated until no discrepancy is sensed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HEEL REST ARRANGEMENT FOR A PULLING OVERAND LASTING MACHINEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention is concerned with improvements in or relating to a heel rest arrangement for a pulling over and lasting machine, comprising a mounting for a heel-engaging member, which mounting, and thus the heel- engaging member therewith, is supported for movement in a direction extending heightwise of the bottom of a shoe to be operated upon and also in a direction extending lengthwise of such shoe bottom.It will be appreciated that in a conventional pulling over and lasting machine after the upper of a shoe to be lasted has been placed on the shoe support and the upper has been gripped by pincers arranged about the shoe support, in order to prevent any dislodging of the shoe during a subsequent tensioning operation a heel rest arrangement is provided. In general, the heel rest arrangement will comprise a heel-engaging member, which may be pivotally mounted, for engaging the back seam region of the shoe, about a pivot supported on a mounting, the mounting being in turn supported for movement in the shoe-lengthwise direction in order to accommodate to different sizes of shoe last. Moreover, bearing in mind that according to the heel height of the shoe the back seam region thereof will be located at different locations heightwise of the shoe, the mounting for the heel-engaging member is itself mounted for heightwise movement thus to accommodate to shoes of different heel height.At the present time the adjustment of the heightwise position of the heel-engaging member is at the discretion of the operator. Such adjustment entails the release of locking means, heightwise adjustment of the 

mounting and the re-application of the locking means, all such operations being carried out manually.In the course of a working day, if such adjustments are constantly being required, e.g. where shoes of different styles and sizes are passing through the production line, the demands on the operator in terms not only of time but also effort are significant. Moreover, bearing in mind that the operator will normally be concerned to ensure relatively high productivity, there will be a tendency for him to compromise on the heightwise position of the mounting, rather than always to be adjusting it according to the particular shoe being operated upon.In recent times it has been proposed to render automatic the positioning of various integers of a pulling over and lasting machine according to the size and/or style of the shoe to be operated

<CLAIMS>
Claims :
1. In a pulling over and lasting machine a heel rest arrangement (26) comprising a mounting (44) for a heel-engaging member (32), which mounting (44), and thus the heel-engaging member (32) therewith, is supported for movement in a direction extending heightwise of the bottom of a shoe to be operated upon and also in a direction extending lengthwise of such shoe bottom, characterised by a position-detecting device (52) by which a signal is generated having a value corresponding to the actual heightwise position of the mounting (44), means for inputting a value representing a desired heightwise position of the mounting, and comparator means for comparing the two values.
2. A heel rest arrangement according to Claim 1 wherein locking means (50) is provided for locking the mounting (44) in adjusted heightwise position, characterised by actuator means, operable in response to a discrepancy between the two values when compared by the comparator means, to release the locking means (50) and, after the mounting (44) has been moved to a position where said values match, to re-apply the locking means (50).
3. A heel rest arrangement according to Claim 1 wherein the mounting (44) is manually movable heightwise, characterised by indicator means (30) by which an indication is displayed in the event of a discrepancy between the two values when compared by the comparator means.
4. A heel rest arrangement according to Claim 1 


characterised by power means for effecting heightwise movement of the mounting, said power means being actuated in response to a discrepancy between the two values when compared by the comparator means.
5. A heel rest arrangement according to Claim 1 characterised in that the mounting (44) is supported under a balanced pressure.
6. A heel rest arrangement according to Claim 1 characterised in that the position-detecting device (52) comprises a linear potentiometer (52).
7. A heel rest arrangement according Claim 1 characterised in that in the event of a discrepancy between said values a disabling signal is generated whereby operation of the machine of which the heel rest arrangement forms part is disabled.
