<ABSTRACT>
The advantage of the novel adsorbents having catalytic activity is that after the capacity is exhausted, the adsorbed toxins are completely destroyed during disposal by the built-in catalyst. The structure of one type is described. This is able to adsorb halogenated substances, such as dioxins, and to destroy the substances completely during the pyrolytic disposal phase by the copper catalyst present.
