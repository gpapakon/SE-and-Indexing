<ABSTRACT>
A debris catching arrangement (I) is disclosed for 
incorporation within the flow plenum up stream or below the 

rod supporting grid of the lower tie plate assembly. The 
device is preferably placed within the lower tie plate flow 

plenum between the fuel bundle inlet orifice and the rod 
supporting grid structure supporting the fuel rods; alternate 

placement can include any inlet channel upstream of the fuel 
rods including the fuel support casting (C). The disclosed debris 

catching designs include successive side-by-side coil springs 
(100,102,104,106) placed in layers across the tie 

plate plenum. Preferably, the 
respective tie plates are placed in alternating directions 

with a first layer of springs (100) oriented at 90° to an alternate 
and underlying layer of springs (102). Multiple layers of such 

springs are used with four layers (100,102,104,106) 
being preferred. At their 

respective crossing points, the springs of adjacent layers are 
joined -- as by welding -- with the result that the filter is 

a solid unitary mass.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a boiling water 
nuclear fuel bundle, having a debris catching arrangement 
for incorporation e.g. within the flow volume between the 
inlet nozzle and the rod supporting grid of the lower tie 
plate assembly. An illustrative debris catcher 
arrangement includes a matrix of coil springs loaded 
preferably within the lower tie plate flow plenum of the 
lower tie plate between the inlet nozzle and the bottom 
of the rod supporting grid. Boiling water nuclear reactors operate for many 
years. Commencing with their initial construction and through 
their service lives, these reactors may accumulate debris in 
their closed circulation moderator systems. This debris can 
become an operating hazard if the debris is allowed to enter 
into the fuel bundle containing core region having the heat 
generating fuel rods. In order to understand this problem, a 
summary of reactor construction as it relates to the 
accumulation of debris in the core needs first to be given. 
Thereafter, fuel bundle construction will be set forth. 
Emphasis will be given to the need to preserve substantially 
unchanged the regions of pressure drop within the fuel 
bundles. Thereafter, the effects caused by debris entering 
into the fuel rod region of the fuel bundles will be 
summarized. Boiling water nuclear reactor construction can be 
simply summarized for purposes of.understanding the debris 
entrainment problem. Such nuclear reactors are provided with 
a large, central core. Liquid water coolant/moderator flow  
 
enters the core from the bottom and exits the core as a water 
steam mixture from the top. The core includes many side-by-side fuel bundles. 
Water is introduced into each fuel bundle through a fuel 
bundle support casting from a high pressure plenum which is 
situated below the core. Water passes in a distributed flow 
through the individual fuel bundles, is heated to generate 
steam, and exits the upper portion of the core as a two phase 
water steam mixture from which the steam is extracted for the 
generation of energy. The core support castings and fuel bundles are a 
source of pressure loss in the circulation of water through 
the core. This pressure loss assures the substantially even 
distribution of flow across the individual fuel bundles of the 
reactor core. When it is remembered that there are as many as 
750 individual fuel bundles in a reactor core, it can be 
appreciated that assurance of the uniformity of flow 
distribution is important. To interfere with the pressure 
drop
