<ABSTRACT>
A small, permanent magnet rotor, synchronous electric motor, suitable for use in, for example, a home appliance such as a refrigerator/freezer to drive a fan blade. The rotor of the motor is provided with two, axially displaced magnetic pole pairs, each positioned within an air gap in a single magnetic circuit. A clutch is also provided so that, for example, a fan blade may be mounted on the rotor and the motor may be started reliably, in the correct direction and accelerate relatively slowly to synchronous speed. Further embodiments of the motor include stators having two and three magnetic pole pairs. The method of construction of the stator magnetic circuit ensures efficient usage of stator material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electric motors and has been devised particularly though 
not solely for use in home appliances. Some existing single phase AC electric motors which are utilised in home 
appliances, for example, refrigerator/freezers for driving fans are very inefficient 
electrically. Also, because these motors are necessarily small, many require the 
propeller or blade to have a correspondingly small moment of inertia and thus a small 
diameter in order that the propeller may be rotated from a standstill. This requirement 
is in direct contrast to the need for lower noise levels that can be achieved by large 
diameter fans moving air at a relatively low speed. In existing single phase permanent magnet synchronous motors running from a 
fixed frequency supply, various methods of starting are used that include rotor cages 
and mechanical resonance. These start up arrangements are then disengaged upon the 
rotor nearing synchronous speed. An example of a motor which utilises mechanical 
resonance at start up is disclosed in United States Patent No.4,861,240 (Marioni and 
Cavalcante). This motor, however, has the disadvantages that it produces excessive 
noise and its direction of rotation upon starting is random. GB 628763 discloses a motor having two energisable "U"-shaped stator 
laminations with the limbs of the "U" disposed radially inwards towards polefaces of the 
rotor. The rotor has two laterally separated polar portions, each disposed between the 
ends of a limb of each of the stator laminations. In some motors, the required acceleration to synchronous speed is too great, 
increasing wear on the motor and moving parts and thus an efficient and reliable clutch 
is required. In addition, when the magnetic circuit is of the substantially "horseshoe" 
shape, such as in GB 628763, wasteful use has previously been made of the stator  
 
material. It is an object of the invention to provide an electric motor which will overcome 
the above disadvantages or which will at least provide the public with a useful choice. Accordingly in one aspect the invention consists in an electric motor comprising: 
a permanent magnet rotor and an excited stator, said rotor having two axially separated 
pole regions and said stator being configured to provide two rotor receiving pole pairs, 
each pair providing a rotor receiving space within which respective rotor pole regions 
are disposed and wherein said stator comprises a substantially "U" shaped portion with 
a substantially "I" shaped portion disposed

<CLAIMS>
An electric motor (1) comprising a permanent magnet rotor (27) and an excited 
stator (4), said rotor (27) having two axially separated pole regions and said stator (4) 

being configured to provide two rotor receiving pole pairs (22, 16) (24, 16), each pair 
providing a rotor receiving space (26) within which respective rotor pole regions are 

disposed and wherein said stator (4) comprises a substantially "U" shaped portion (4) 
with a substantially "I" shaped portion (14) disposed across the open ends of said "U" 

shaped portion (4) with said rotor receiving spaces (26) provided between the "I" 
shaped portion (14) and the open ends of the "U" shaped portion (4). 
An electric motor as claimed in claim 1 wherein said stator (4) is made up of 
separate laminations of ferromagnetic material and adjacent laminations are displaced 

relative to each other such that said stator poles (22, 16) (24, 16) are each formed by a 
pair of semi-circular shaped poles to provide said rotor receiving spaces (26). 
A method of constructing a stator (4) for an electric motor (1) from a single piece 
(10) of magnetically permeable material comprising the steps of: 


i) removing a central portion (14) from said piece (10), said central portion 
(14) having ends (15) and central sides (16) between said ends (15), one of said ends 

(15) of said central portion (14) comprising part of the first side (12) of said piece 
(10); and 
ii) placing the central portion (14) of said piece (10) across the remaining 
portions (22, 24) of said first side (12) with a central side (16) disposed adjacent the 

remaining portions (22, 24) of said first side (12) with rotor receiving spaces (26) 
therebetween. 
A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein said material is laminated and said 
method also includes the step of displacing adjacent said laminations relative to each 

other in order to produce cylindrical rotor receiving spaces (26). 
A method as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4 wherein the remainder of said piece 
(10) is substantially "U" shaped.
