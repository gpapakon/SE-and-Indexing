<ABSTRACT>
A transport system for taking spools of thread (3) on a conveyor from a textile machine (1) through an inspection station (26) to a final station. The textile machine has a plurality of positions (I-VIII) at which a plurality of spools are adjacently arranged one behind the other and produced in this manufacturing configuration. The conveyor between the textile machine (1) and the inspection station (26) is interrupted, the partial sections are connected by an intermediate station (11), the spools (3) are conveyed in the first partial section between their winding head and the intermediate station (11) in the manufacturing configuration or a division therein, the spools are rearranged in the intermediate station (11) to a flat configuration and transferred to an inspection carriage and the second partial section leads through the inspection station (26) to the end station. The spools can be alternative or additively arranged in a preferably vertical flat configuration before being taken to the inspection station (26), said spools being individually impaled on pins (17) on an inspection carriage which are arranged in a flat array, the pins (17), being long enough to be able to take several spools. In addition, the bearing frame is taken, when the conveyor is loaded with a layer of spools, through the inspection station (26) and finally on the existing layer of spools is laid another layer which is then taken to the inspection station (26). Besides only spools bearing the same kind of thread are laid on a conveyor.
