<ABSTRACT>
The combination solenoid valve and shuttle valve (60) with self-cleaning orifice (92) comprises a shuttle valve (50) which is slidingly and sealingly received at an end (40D) of the solenoid valve (40). The shuttle valve (50) includes a stepped interior opening (54) which includes an insert (55) providing a shuttle valve seat (91) opposite a self-aligning solenoid valve seat assembly (94) of the solenoid valve (40). The valve seat (91) of the shuttle valve (50) includes an orifice (92) which extends from an end opening (70) of the insert and communicates with an insert passage (63) at an outer radial portion of the insert (55). An opposite radial side of the insert (55) includes a port (67) which communicates with a longitudinal passage (66) of the insert (55). Disposed within the longitudinal passage (66) is a brake-master cylinder check valve (59), and a stabilization check valve (58) adjacent a filter element (80) which permits communication with the insert passage (63). The shuttle valve (50) includes an end passage (64) having a pump check valve (57) and which communicates with an interior cavity (65) of the insert member (55). Fluid pressure from a pump mechanism (18) causes the shuttle valve (50) to be displaced and engage the shuttle valve seat (91) with the self-aligning valve seat assembly (94) so that fluid pressure from the pump mechanism (18) passes around the pump check valve (57), through the filter element (80) and insert passage (63), and out both ends of the orifice (92) for transmission to a second bore section (72) and a wheel brake (16) and to a first bore section (71) and a pressure producing device such as a master cylinder (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
combination solenoid valve and shuttle valve with a self 
cleaning orifice, and in particular to an electrically 
operated valve mechanism for an adaptive braking system. Numerous adaptive braking systems have been 
proposed previously. Adaptive braking systems can 
typically include numerous solenoid valves, check valves, 
flow restrictions, shuttle valves, and various types of 
pressure source mechanisms. In adaptive braking systems 
which utilize solenoid valves and shuttle valves, it is 
highly desirable to combine structurally a solenoid valve 
with its respective shuttle valve. Combined solenoid 
valve and shuttle valve structures are disclosed in U. S. 
Patent Nos. 4,620,565 (which corresponds to the precharacterizing 
part of Claim 1 below); 4,844,119; and 
4,936,344. The combined structure has a potential for 
greatly simplifying the number and complexity of plumbing 
connections, and substantially reducing the cost of the 
entire system. U. S. Patent No. 5,226,702 and U. S. 
Patent No. 5,163,474 both filed November 15, 1991 (and 
published after the priority date of this application) 
disclose combination solenoid valve and shuttle valve 
structures. It is highly desirable to provide such a 
combined structure which will be effective to prevent the 
contamination of the internal parts of the structure. 
During the manufacturing and assembly process, numerous 
items of contamination can work their way into the 
structure or assembly and result in subsequent plugging 
of the fluid pressure build and feedback orifices. 
Therefore, it is highly desirable to relocate the build 
and feedback orifices so that during an operation of the 
combination solenoid valve and shuttle valve structure 
the orifices will receive a washing or flushing and 
contamination is washed away. Such a self-cleaning 
mechanism will make build and feedback orifice designs 
more robust and reliable.  
 The present invention provides solutions to the 
above problems by providing a combination solenoid valve 
and shuttle valve, comprising a body having therein a 
bore comprising a first bore section, a second bore 
section, and a third bore section sealingly isolated from 
one another at the perimeter of the bore, the first bore 
section able to receive pressure from a pressure 
producing device and pump means , the solenoid valve and 
shuttle valve disposed within the bore and the solenoid 
valve operable to communicate said second bore section 
with said third bore section, the
