<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tubular heat exchanger in which the tubes have combustion gases flowing through them and are flowed around outside by air or other media or are connected to other media. There are one or more points of condensate accumulation inside the tubes. In order to produce an exchanger of this type which can be accommodated effectively in terms of space with the aid of simple means, it is proposed on the basis of the invention to arrange the base (sole) (7) of the feed (delivery, supply) and discharge lines, respectively, for the combustion gases higher than the base (6) of the pipes located between the feed and discharge lines and serving to accumulate the condensate.

<CLAIMS>
Heat exchanger having pipes, comprising a 
horizontal inlet pipe (1), a horizontal outlet pipe (1') 

and horizontal pipes (2), which are disposed between the 
inlet and outlet pipes (1, 1') and are connected thereto, 

wherein the pipes are traversed by combustion gases, 
preferably by the combustion gases of hot-water boilers, 

accumulations of condensate being situated internally of 
one or more pipes (2), characterised in that the horizontal 

bases (7) of the inlet and outlet pipes (1, 1') for the 
combustion gases are disposed at a higher level than the 

horizontal base (6) of the pipes (2) communicating 
therewith. 
Exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the inlet and outlet pipes (1), on the one hand, and 

the other pipes (2), on the other hand, have a variable 
diameter, and the inlet and outlet pipes have a smaller 

diameter. 
Exchanger according to claim 2, characterised in 
that ratios of the diameters are substantially 1 : 1.5. 
Exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the base (6) of the pipes (2), which are disposed 

between the inlet and outlet pipes (1), is disposed 
substantially in one plane when there are a plurality of 

pipes (2) adjacent one another. 
Exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the transition between the pipes (1, 2) is caused by 

reducing elements (3). 
Exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the pipes (1, 2) are disposed so as to be vertically 

offset from one another.  
 
Exchanger according to claims 1 or 6, characterised 
in that the uppermost portions of the pipes (1, 2) are 

disposed in one plane (10). 
Exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in 
that all of the pipes (1, 2) and their connections (3) are 

formed from plastics material and are joined by being 
fitted together. 
Exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the size of the pipes (1, 2) is so selected, and their 

offset arrangement is so configured, that the unobstructed 
cross-sectional area of passage through the pipes (2) with 

the accumulation of condensate is at least substantially as 
large as the cross-sectional area of passage of the inlet 

and outlet pipes (1) when the pipes (2) have received their 
maximum quantity of condensate. 
Heat exchanger having pipes, comprising a 
horizontal inlet pipe (13), an outlet pipe (14) and 

horizontal pipes (20), laid in an S-shaped configuration, 
which are disposed between the inlet and outlet pipes (13, 

14) and are connected thereto, wherein the pipes (20) are 
traversed by combustion gases, preferably by the combustion 

gases of hot-water boilers, accumulations of condensate 
being situated internally of one or more pipes (20), 

characterised in that the inlet pipe (13) includes a 
reducing element (3) in such a manner that the horizontal 

base of the inlet pipe (13) is disposed at a higher level 
than the horizontal base (6) of the pipes (20) 

communicating therewith, and in that the outlet pipe (14) 
is an upwardly bent portion.
