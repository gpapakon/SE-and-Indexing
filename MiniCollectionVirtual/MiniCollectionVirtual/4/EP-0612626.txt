<ABSTRACT>
A color thermal printer (10) loads a dye receiver (30) 
for printing by moving the dye receiver (30) in a first 

direction through a gap between a print head (23) and a 
platen (24). A dye donor (20), also positioned in the gap, moves 

in the first direction during receiver loading. The 
moving dye donor (20) engages the dye receiver (30), assisting 

the dye receiver (30) through the gap. When the dye 
receiver (30) is detected downstream of the gap, the dye 

receiver (30) is positioned in a beginning receiver print 
position and the position of the dye donor (20) with respect 

to the print head (23) is determined. If the print head (23) 
position is downstream of a beginning donor print 

position, the dye donor (20) is rewound in a second 
direction opposite the first direction until the print 

head (23) is upstream of the beginning donor print position, 
whereupon the dye donor (20) is moved to the beginning donor 

print position. If the print head (23) position is upstream 
of the beginning donor print position when the dye 

receiver (30) is detected, the dye donor (20) is moved to the 
beginning donor print position. A normal printing 

sequence occurs when both dye donor (20) and dye receiver (30) 
are in their respective beginning print positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color
thermal printing system using a dye receiver and a dye
donor movable past a print head.Color thermal printers with a small roller
platen use a dye donor and a dye receiver positioned
between a print head and the platen for printing
information upon the dye receiver. A printing
operation typically begins with a loading sequence in
which the print head and dye donor are spaced away from
the roller platen, and the dye receiver is moved from a
supply tray along a receiver transport path defined by
a receiver transport mechanism. The receiver transport
mechanism urges the dye receiver toward a gap between
the print head and the roller platen. After moving
through the gap, the dye receiver is positioned
appropriately and a printing sequence occurs where
information is printed on the dye receiver.A problem occurs during the loading sequence
as the dye receiver initially approaches the gap
between the print head and the platen. The stiffness
of the dye receiver can cause it to engage the dye
donor upstream of the gap, instead of passing through
the gap without touching the dye donor. The friction
from the dye receiver engaging the dye donor requires
greater drive forces to move the dye receiver through
the gap than would otherwise be necessary.One method to overcome this problem is to
increase the power or complexity of the receiver
transport mechanism, incurring the disadvantages of
increased cost and complexity.Another method to overcome this problem is to
space the print head and dye donor a larger distance
from the roller platen during the loading sequence. 
This has the disadvantages of increasing the printer's
volume and print operation time.Yet another method to solve this problem is
provided by this invention, in which the dye donor is
moved in the same direction as the dye receiver during
the loading sequence to reduce friction between the dye
donor and dye receiver. When the dye receiver has passed
through the gap, the dye donor is moved in a reverse
direction to rewind it and thus minimize unused dye
donor.Further attention is drawn to US patent
4,812,063 which discloses that a thermal transfer head
presses to a platen, and carries the recording paper and
the ink sheet while synchronizing carrying speeds for the
ink sheet and recording paper.An object of this invention is to reduce
friction between a dye receiver and a dye donor during a
loading sequence of a thermal printer's operation.A further object of this invention is to reduce
the force necessary to

A color thermal printer (10) which uses a dye donor (20) with
repeating groups of sequential color patches (62, 64, 66) being positioned at a

print head (23), and a dye receiver (30), the print head in a first position
defines a gap between the print head and a platen (24), and in a second

position the print head presses the dye donor against the dye receiver and the
platen, and said printer further defines a receiver transport path, including

means (26, 28, 34) for moving the dye receiver in a first direction along the
receiver transport path to and through the gap between the print head and the platen,

means (16, 18) for moving the dye donor in said first direction while the dye receiver is moving
in said first direction, and comprising a controller (11)

coupled to said dye receiver moving means (26, 28, 34) and to said dye donor moving
means (16, 18) for controlling movement of said dye donor and

said dye receiver, 
characterized by

movement of the dye donor

so that the dye donor engages said moving dye receiver at a predetermined
speed such that friction therebetween is minimized in order to assist the dye

receiver to move through the gap.
