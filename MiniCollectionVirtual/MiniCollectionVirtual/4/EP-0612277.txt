<ABSTRACT>
Methods for fabricating a sintered element from unsinterable material, utilizing the property that it will form a eutectic composition or alloy with a suitable alloying agent at a temperature which is below the plastic deformation temperature of the material. Discrete particles of the material to be sintered are coated with a thin coating of the alloying agent and are packed into position to be sintered. Then, the coated grains or wire pieces are heated so that at least the coating and the regions of the grains just below the coating are slowly raised in temperature. Diffusion regions of alloying agent into the grains of the sinterable material will occur. Further heating continues so at least the diffusion regions increase in temperature to slightly above the eutectic melting point. Localized melting of the diffusion regions occurs where the eutectic concentration is reached, and adjacent grains begin to share the localized melting regions and become mutually wet. The alloying agent continues to diffuse, and drops in concentration, so that it freezes out of the localized melting regions. The melting point of the melting regions tends to rise, and the wetted melted regions freeze to form a sintered and solid element.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR ALLOY MIGRATION SINTERINGFIELD OF THE INVENTION:This invention relates to methods of alloy migration sintering whereby sintered and solid elements of an otherwise unsinterable material, combined with a surface coating of a suitable alloying agent, may be formed. The invention provides methods by which various solid elements of the otherwise unsinterable material may be produced, not the least of which is electrodes for batteries. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:Fusion of eutectic compositions is a well-known phenomenon. Fusion essentially means melting, and eutectic fusion describes the phenomenon of a combination of two materials at a generally closely defined temperature which is well below the melting point of either of those materials itself. Thus, the melting point of the first material lowers as some quantity of the second material is added to it, until a certain temperature called the eutectic melting point, which is the lowest melting point for the particular composition. Thereafter, as the ratio of the two elements is increased in the favor of the second element, the melting point again begins to arise. The composition at which the lowest melting point occurs is the eutectic composition, and is expressed in terms of percentages of the two elements or materials being alloyed. A typical, and very well known, eutectic composition is one which the present invention particularly utilizes in a principal application of the invention. That is the eutectic composition of tin and lead, which occurs when there is a mixture 

 of 37% of lead with 63% of tin. Its eutectic melting point is 361"F.A number of other elements and materials exist, however, for which eutectic compositions can be made of those materials together with suitable alloying agents. They include numerous ferrous materials such as nickel vanadium steel, ref actories, certain ceramics, and so on.Because the eutectic melting point of a eutectic composition of a material together with its alloying agent occurs at a temperature below the melting point of either the material or the alloying agent itself, as a composition comprising a material together with an alloying agent increases in temperature, it will first reach the eutectic melting point for that combination of materials and the mixture becomes molten. When the mixture becomes molten, it becomes wet, so that a certain amount of flow of the molten eutectic composition can be expected to occur. It is these features of which the present invention is particularly cognizant, and the
