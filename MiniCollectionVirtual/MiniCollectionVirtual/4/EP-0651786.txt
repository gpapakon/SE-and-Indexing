<ABSTRACT>
An improved optical system for use in an instrument for culturing and detecting the presence of microorganisms in human tissue specimens is disclosed. The improved optical detection system is designed to reduce unwanted noise by substantially blocking all light other than light from a sensor positioned on an inside wall of a culture bottle from reaching the photodetector. A control circuit providing a "lock-in" detection system designed to reduce unwanted noise is also disclosed. The detection system is capable of rapidly and automatically detecting whether a specimen bottle has been inserted into the instrument.

 IMPROVED OPTICAL DETECTION SYSTEMFOR APPARATUS TO CULTURE ANDDETECT BACTERIA IN HUMAN TISSUEThis application is a continuation-in-part of application S.N. 07/887,627, filed May 22, 1992, pending, and is also a continuation-in-part of application S.N. 07/638,481, filed January 4, 1991, also pending, which, in turn, is a continuation-in-part of application S.N. 07,609,278, filed, November 5, 1990, now U.S. Patent No. 5,173,434, all of which prior applications are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to analytical apparatus for detecting the presence of bacteria in human tissue, and is particularly directed to an improved optical detection system for use in automated apparatus for culturing and detecting viable bacteria in human blood specimens.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONBacteremia — the prolonged presence of one or more viable bacteria in the blood — is a serious and life- threatening infection. The most common symptom of bacteremia is a fever of unknown origin. Accordingly, hospitals routinely perform a large number of tests to determine whether patients exhibiting this symptom have bacteremia. Presently, the only way a definitive diagnosis can be made is by isolating bacteria in the blood by means of a so-called "blood culture." Because bacteremia is life-threatening, positive specimens must 

be detected as quickly as possible so that the patient can be treated with the correct antibiotics.Currently, there are several methods of detecting positive blood cultures. The conventional manual method involves inoculating bottles containing a growth medium with blood specimens. The growth medium is formulated to provide nutrients for bacterial growth. The bottles are inspected daily for obvious signs of bacterial growth. Samples from bottles suspected to be positive are then further cultured to obtain isolated bacterial colonies which can then be identified. This method is very labor- intensive and costly, since daily inspections and subculturing of suspect bottles are required.Various attempts have been made to improve the conventional manual method. For example, culture bottles have been made with added attachments containing solid media. The user inverts the bottle each day, thereby inoculating the solid media and enabling growth of isolated bacterial colonies, which can then be identified. Another improved process uses a "growth indicator" which detects the buildup of gases in the headspace of the bottle. A third method is to

CLAIMS
WHAT 18 CLAIMED IS:
1. An instrument for detecting the presence of microorganisms in human tissue in a specimen-containing vessel comprising: means for holding one or more specimen-containing vessels; light emission means for emitting light, said light emission means being configured to permit emitted light to impinge upon a sensor positioned on an inside wall of a specimen-containing vessel held in the vessel holding means; light detection means for converting light energy from the sensor into a detectable signal; and light blocking means substantially covering all but a selected portion of the sensor for substantially preventing light other than light from the sensor from reaching the light detection means.
2. The instrument of Claim 1 wherein the light blocking means comprises (a) a spatial filter interposed between the light detection means and the vessel, said spatial filter defining an aperture through which a selected portion of the sensor may be optically interrogated through the vessel, and (b) a light-blocking layer substantially covering all outer surfaces of the sensor other than the surface in contact with the wall of the vessel.
3. The instrument of Claim 1 wherein the light emission means emits excitation light capable of exciting a fluorophore in the sensor and the light blocking means is adapted to prevent substantially all light other than 


the fluorescent emission from the fluorophore from reaching the light detection means.
4. An instrument for detecting the presence of microorganisms in human tissue comprising: means for holding one or more specimen-containing vessels; a plurality of light sources capable of emitting excitation light falling within a light source emission wavelength range, said light sources being configured to permit excitation light from each of the light sources to impinge upon a sensor affixed to an inside wall of a specimen-containing vessel held in the vessel holding means and to thereby cause the sensor to emit sensor emission light; light detection means configured to convert the sensor emission light into a detectable signal; and
