<ABSTRACT>
The rock drill with clamping shank (1) and drill point (2) has disposal flutes (3, 4) running helically in between. The backs (R) between the disposal flutes (3, 4) contain secondary flutes (5, 6) and guide areas (7, 8, 9, 10), the disposal flutes (3, 4) and secondary flutes (5, 6) being separated from one another by the guide areas (7, 8, 9, 10). The width (BH) of the disposal flutes (3, 4) essentially corresponds to twice the overall width (BG) of a secondary flute (5, 6) and of two guide areas (7, 8, 9, 10).

Rock drill with a clamping shank (1), with a bit (2)
and with clearance flutes (3, 4) extending in the

shape of helices longitudinally therebetween, the
body clearances (R) left between the clearance flutes

(3, 4) having ancillary flutes (5, 6) between guiding
zones (7, 8, 9, 10) which are respectively contiguous

with the clearance flutes (3, 4), and the width (BH)
of the clearance flutes (3, 4), where said width (BH)

is measured at right angles to the pitch (α),
corresponding to substantially twice the width (BG)

of the body clearance (R) comprising the ancillary
flute (5, 6) and two guiding zones (7, 8, 9, 10),

where said width (BG) is measured at right angles to
the pitch (α), characterised in that the width (BH)

of the clearance flute (3, 4), where said width (BH)
is measured at right angles to the pitch (α), is 1.4

to 2.5 times the width (BG) of the body clearance (R)
comprising the ancillary flute (5, 6) and two guiding

zones (7, 8, 9, 10), where said width (BG) is
measured at right angles to the pitch (α), and that

the cross-section of the clearance flutes (3, 4),
where said cross-section extends at right angles to

the pitch (α), is substantially symmetrical in
construction and proceeding from the centre runs flat

and in a straight line and rises steeply and in a
straight line towards the guiding zones (7, 8, 9,

10).
Rock drill according to claim 1, characterised in
that the width (BN) of the ancillary flutes (5, 6),

where said width (BN) is measured at right angles to
the pitch (α), is 0.5 to 2.5 times the width (BF) of

a guiding zone (7, 8, 9, 10), where said width (BF)
is measured at right angles to the pitch (α). 
Rock drill according to either of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the depth (TN) of the ancillary

flutes (5, 6) is 0.2 to 0.5 times the depth (TH) of
he clearance flutes (3, 4).
Rock drill according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the cross-section of the

ancillary flutes (5, 6), which extends at right
angles to the pitch (α), is of a substantially semicircular

configuration.
