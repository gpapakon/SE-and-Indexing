<ABSTRACT>
A method for filtering an aqueous mineral slurry through a ceramic filter plate (8) is disclosed. The method includes applying a suction across the filter plate (8) to form a cake (22) thereon. The filter plate (8) and cake (22) are removed from the slurry and subjected to a cake discharging by employing one or more positive water pulses in a reverse direction through the filter plate (8) and applying oscillations or vibrations (26) to the filter plate (8) to effect the discharge of the cake (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR FILTERING MINERAL SLURRIESBACKGROUND OF INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to methods for filtering fine particles from a liquid carrier and more specifically relates to an improved method for dewatering aqueous slurries of very fine particle size minerals, including industrial minerals such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonates, and the like, as well as slurries of fine particle size coal, metaliferous ores, and the like.In the course of processing numerous minerals, a step of dewatering by filtration is commonly utilized. Such a requirement may be exemplified by considering the processing of crude industrial minerals such as kaolin clays and ground calcium carbonates, where the crude materials are commonly subjected to a series of steps intended to remove undesired impurities such as discolorants, so as to ultimately provide a refined product which is susceptible to the particular use for which it is intended. In the instance, for example, of kaolins, such beneficiation may in some instances be accomplished by dry processing techniques, as for example by air flotation. More commonly, however, especially where the impurities or contaminants to be removed are in some manner chemically combined or intimately associated with the mineral, wet processes of various types are employed. These include such well-known processes as froth flotation, reductive and oxidative bleaching, and high intensity magnetic separation. This is in addition to wet classification, which can also be regarded as a beneficiation step achieving some of the aforementioned objectives.Thus, in a typical procedure wherein the initial starting material is a crude sedimentary kaolin clay, including from about 1-2% titania, the said crude may be subjected 

to a separation process to reduce the titania content to below 0.8% by weight. More generally, the titania will be reduced to the range of from about 0.2 to 0.8. Where a froth flotation process is used for such purposes, the clay may be initially blunged and conditioned by forming an aqueous alkaline dispersion of the clay (pH adjusted to about 7-10 with ammonium hydroxide) . The dispersion may include as a deflocculating agent various compounds known to be useful for such purposes, such as sodium silicate. Other useful agents include a water-soluble salt of a polyacrylic acid or polymethacrylic acid preferably having an average molecular weight in the range of from about 500-10,000. Oleic acid or other collector agent is added during the conditioning process. Reference

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. In the method for filtering an aqueous mineral slurry by flowing said slurry through a ceramic filter plate which is characterized by a porous support layer and an overlying porous filtration layer, the pore sizes in said filtration layer being substantially all in the range of from about 0.5 to 3 μm, and said flow through said filter plate being from said filter layer side toward said base layer, and being effected by establishing a fluid pressure differential across the said filter plate by applying suction to the said porous suppport layer; THE IMPROVEMENT facilitating effective discharge of the filter cake from the said plate which accumulates upon the said porous filtration layer; comprising:
extinguishing said suction and subjecting the support layer side of said plate to one or more positive water pressure pulses to effect a transient reverse flow through said plate and via the uniform pore structure generate a uniform back pressure and a lubricating film of water at the interface between said filtration layer and said filter cake; and
applying oscillations or vibrations to the surface of said porous filtration layer to facilitate separation of the said filter cake.
2. A method in accordance with claim 1, wherein a said water pulse has a pressure in the range of 15 - 45 psi.

7. A method in accordance with claim 1, further including the step of cleaning the filter plate following discharge of the filter cake, by inducing a backwash flow of water from the support layer side of said plate, while simultaneously applying ultrasonic vibrations to the said plate.
8. A method in accordance with claim 1, wherein said support layer defines the hollow interior of said plate, and flow through said support and filtration layer is induced by withdrawing or flowing water to said interior.
