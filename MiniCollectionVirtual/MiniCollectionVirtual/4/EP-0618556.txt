<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a 
photoelectric type fire detector capable of reporting an own 

trouble in an early stage and detecting an own trouble by 
itself. 
An upper limit and a lower limit are predetermined for 
output levels of an amplifier in a photoelectric type fire 

detector. Between the process of fire monitoring, a gain set in 
the amplifier is increased automatically. It is then detected 

that output level of the amplifier resulting from an increase in 
gain deviates from a range defined with the predetermined upper 

and lower limits. The number of times of detection with respect 
to output level deviating from the range is counted. If the 

counted number of output levels exceeds a predetermined maximum, 
it is determined that the photoelectric type fire detector is 

abnormal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photoelectric type 
fire detector in a fire alarm system, or more particularly, to 
an own-failure detecting function. A photoelectric type fire detector comprises a light 
emitting element and a light receiving element both lying in a 
dark chamber. Light emanating from the light emitting element 
is scattered with smoke. The scattered light is detected by the 
light receiving element. The detected quantity of light is 
amplified by an amplifier. The level of an output signal of the 
amplifier is analyzed to work out a smoke density. Thus, fire 
monitoring is effected. The photoelectric type fire detector 
performs not only the fire monitoring but also what is referred 
to as stationary value monitoring. For the stationary value 
monitoring, a stationary value (which is output by the amplifier 
in a non-fire state) is detected in the photoelectric type fire 
detector, and then a trouble in the photoelectric type fire 
detector (own failure) is identified using the detected 
stationary value. The stationary value is much smaller than the output 
levels of the amplifier resulting from occurrence of a fire. 
When the stationary value is used as it is, it is hard to 
determine whether the photoelectric type fire detector is 
abnormal or not. A prior art for allowing a photoelectric type fire 
detector to detect an own trouble is described in Japanese  
 
Examined Patent Publication No.64-4239. The prior art has a 
light emitting element, a light receiving element for receiving 
light from the light emitting element, and an upper limit 
comparator and a lower limit comparator for comparing an output 
signal of the light receiving element with an upper limit and a 
lower limit respectively. A fire receiver is used to remotely 
control the comparators in the photoelectric type fire detector. In the above prior art, the photoelectric type fire 
detector itself cannot detect an own trouble without controlling 
the comparators in the photoelectric type fire detector from the 
fire receiver. This results in the heavy load the fire receiver 
must incur. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
photoelectric type fire detector capable of reporting an own 
trouble in an early stage and detecting an own trouble by 
itself. According to the present invention, an upper limit and 
a lower limit are pre-set for output level of an amplifier. 
Between the process of fire monitoring, a gain set in the 
amplifier is increased automatically at a predetermined 
interval. In each of
