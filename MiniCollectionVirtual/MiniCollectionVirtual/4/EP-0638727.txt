<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a compressor (1), designed in particular for a gas turbine, which comprises a rotor (3) which at its perimeter is fitted with a multiplicity of rotor blades (5a-d) and is supported so as to be rotatable about a compressor axis, and a compressor casing (2) which surrounds the rotor (3) concentrically, radial play being provided between the outer ends of the rotor blades (5a-d) and the inner wall of the compressor casing (2), the object of the invention being to be able to carry out the warm start without a loss in efficiency. This is achieved by, in order to reduce the fluctuations of radial play, the compressor casing (2) being designed so as to be heatable and being connected to a separate heating appliance (22, 25, 27) which is independent of the operation of the compressor and by means of which the casing can be heated in the event of a warm start.

Compressor arrangement having a compressor, in 
particular for a gas turbine, which compressor (1) 

includes a rotor (3), which is rotatably supported about 
a compressor centre line and possesses at its periphery 

a plurality of rotor blades (5a-d), and a compressor 
casing (2), which concentrically surrounds the rotor (3) 

and has on its inner periphery a plurality of guide vanes 
(4, 4a-c), a radial clearance being provided between the 

outer ends of the rotor blades (5a-d) and the inner wall 
of the compressor casing (2), charactertized in that the 

compressor casing (2) is configured so that it can be 
heated in order to reduce the fluctuations in the radial 

clearance and is connected to a separate heating 
appliance (22, 25, 27), which is independent of the 

operation of the compressor and by means of which the 
compressor casing can be heated in the case of a warm 

start, in that a plurality of peripheral heating passages 
(7a-c), which are arranged one behind the other in the 

direction of the compressor centre line and through which 
a heated heating medium can be dispatched in a circulating 

manner, are provided in the compressor casing (2), in 
that turned vane recesses (8) are provided on the inner 

periphery of the compressor casing (2) to accommodate the 
guide vanes (4, 4a-c), into which recesses the guide 

vanes (4, 4a-c) are pushed by means of corresponding vane 
roots (6a-c) and in that the heating passages (7a-c) are 

respectively formed by grooves which are let into the 
bottoms of the turned vane recesses (8). 
Compressor arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that a plurality, preferably three, 

heating passages (7a-c) are respectively connected one 
behind the other in a row, and in that the heating medium 

flows through this row against the flow direction of the 
compressor (1). 
Compressor arrangement according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that each heating passage (7a-c) forms 

per se a circular ring and, in the case of heating  
 

passages connected in series, the adjacent individual 
heating passages are connected to one another by transfer 

passages (9, 16) extending parallel to the compressor 
centre line. 
Compressor arrangement according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the heating medium is guided with 

alternating peripheral directions in adjacent heating 
passages. 
Compressor arrangement according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the compressor casing (2) is 

subdivided along a split plane (18) into a casing upper 
part (2b) and a casing lower part (2a), in that the 

heating passages (7a-c) are interrupted at the split 
plane (18) and in that the transfer passages (9, 16) 

alternately extend above and below the split plane (18).

Compressor arrangement according to one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that compressed air is 

used as the heating medium, and in that the heating 
appliance includes a compressed air connection 25 from 

which a compressed air supply conduit (27) leads via a 
heating system (22) to the compressor casing (2). 
Compressor arrangement according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the heating system (22) is 

configured as a heat exchanger. 
Compressor arrangement according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the heating system (22) is
