<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus 
for recording and reproducing information to/from a 

recording medium by using a scanning probe microscope 
comprises a circuit to reproduce recording bits formed 

on the recording medium (1,21,41) on the basis of a physical 
amount such as tunnel current, interatomic force, 

electrostatic force, or magnetic force which occurs 
between the probe (2,22,42) and the recording medium, a sensor (9) to 

detect a state such as film thickness or film quality 

of the recording medium on the basis of the physical 
amount before the recording bits are reproduced, and a 

correcting circuit (10,30,50) to correct reproducing conditions 
such as a magnitude of a voltage which is applied 

between the probe and the medium on the basis of the 
detected state of the medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording and
reproducing apparatus for recording and/or reproducing
information by using a scanning probe microscope for
detecting surface information of a sample by a tunnel
current, force, or the like which is generated between
the probe and the sample.The information recording and reproducing
apparatus of the invention incorporates all of an
apparatus for performing only the reproduction of
information and an apparatus for executing both of the
recording and reproduction of information.Scanning probe microscopes (hereinafter, simply
referred to as an "SPM") are classified into several
types in accordance with physical properties which are
detected. A number of various kinds of physical
amounts such as force, light, electrostatic
capacitance, and the like, like a tunnel current, an
interatomic force, an electrostatic force, a magnetic
force, and the like are used as targets to be detected.
In all of those cases, they are common in terms of a
point that the physical amount is detected by a probe 
having a sharp tip. The SPM has rapidly been developed
in recent years as a detecting method which indicates a
high space resolution of 0.1 to tens of nm.In association with the development of the SPM,
many techniques about a recording and reproducing
apparatus to which the principle of the SPM is applied
have been proposed so far. By effectively utilizing
the high space resolution of the SPM, ultramicro
recording bits each having a size of one to hundreds of
nm can be formed and reproduced by a stimulus such as
current, electric field, force, and the like which is
generated between a probe and a local region of a
recording layer. A recording density can be remarkably
raised.The recording method is mainly classified into a
method of giving a physical shape change to the surface
of the recording layer and a method of giving a change
in electrical, magnetic, chemical, or optical state to
the surface of the recording layer. As a former
method, there can be mentioned a method of giving a
physical deformation by the probe, a method of giving a
thermal deformation by a high energy beam such as laser
beam, electron beam, or the like, a method using an
electric field evaporation by a high electric field, a
method of depositing micro particles, or the like. As
a latter method, there can be mentioned a method using
an electrical switching phenomenon which has been found 
out in an organic compound of the Ï€ electron system or
a chalcogen compound (JP-A-63-161552, JP-A-63-161553),
