<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging
arrangement for the containment of at least one
hydrophilic contact lens in a sterile aqueous solution.
More specifically, the invention pertains to a packaging
arrangement wherein a plurality of disposable
hydrophilic contact lenses are contained in a specific
number of individual packaging arrangements collectively
housed in a box-like container or carton so as to
provide a specified or essentially measured supply of
contact lenses for use by a consumer over a
predetermined period of time.The packaging of hydrophilic contact lenses in
a sterile aqueous solution is well known in the contact
lens manufacturing technology. In particular, such
packaging arrangements generally consist of so-called
blister packages which are employed for the storage and
dispensing of the hydrophilic contact lenses by a
medical practitioner or to consumer who intends to wear
the contact lenses. Generally, such hydrophilic contact
lenses, which may be disposable after a single wear or
short-term use, are manufactured from suitable
hydrophilic polymeric materials. These materials may
be, amongst others, copolymers of hydroxyethyl
methacrylate containing from about 20% to 90% or more of
water, depending upon the polymer composition.
Generally, such contact lenses must be stored in a
sterile aqueous solution, usually in isotonic saline 
solution in order to prevent dehydration and to maintain
the lenses in a ready-to-wear condition.Heretofore, contact lens manufacturers
normally utilized stoppered glass bottles containing
sterile saline solutions in which the hydrophilic
contact lenses were immersed as storage and shipping
containers for individual contact lenses. Each bottle
was sealed with a suitable silicone stopper and provided
with a metal closure as a safety seal in the
configuration of an overcap. When the contact lens was
intended to be removed from the bottle for use by a
patient, the metal closure safety seal was required to
be initially torn off the bottle, thereafter the stopper
withdrawn and the lens lifted out from the bottle
through the intermediary of a suitable plastic tweezer
or pouring the contents out. This entailed the
implementation of an extremely complicated procedure,
since the contact lens was difficult to grasp and remove
from the saline solution contained in the bottle due to
the transparent nature of the contact lens which
rendered it practically invisible to the human eye.More recently, containments in the form of
blister packages have been developed for
