<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a
phase-locked oscillator circuit which provides a stable
output signal synchronized to the phase of an input
signal.In synchronous multiplexed transmission
systems, a known method of network synchronization is
that in which a highly stable clock signal is transmitted
from the master station to a slave station, this clock
signal being then transmitted from the slave station to
other slave stations, each of the slave stations
generating a clock signal which is phase-locked to the
received clock signal, the generated clock signal being
used to perform transmission processing.Therefore, at each of the slave stations it is
necessary to suppress the jitter of the clock signal
received via the transmission path, and to generate a
stabilized clock signal. For example, in a system which
uses a ultra-precise network-synchronization equipment,
because there is only a minute variation in phase, a
configuration for generating a clock signal using a
phase-locked oscillator circuit having a narrow loop
bandwidth implemented by a microprocessor or other means
is known. In contrast to this, in a configuration in
which the master station has a clock generator which is
of relatively high stability but not ultra-precise,
wherein the clock signal from this clock generator is
transmitted to the slave stations, each of the slave
stations must have a phase-locked oscillator circuit
having a wide pull-in frequency range. In addition, to
achieve compactness in the slave stations, it is
necessary to make the configuration used to generate such 
clock signals compact as well.FIG. 8 shows an example of prior art, in which
81 is a phase-comparison circuit, 82 is a loop filter, 83
is a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), 84 is a
frequency-conversion circuit, 85 is an M/M+1 frequency
divider (hereinafter, referred to as a programmable-ratio
frequency-division circuit), 86 is a frequency divider,
and 87 is an AND circuit, and wherein frequency
conversion is performed by frequency-conversion
circuit 84 so that the oscillation frequency of voltage-controlled
oscillator 83 is the same as the frequency of
the input signal, and phase comparison is performed at
phase-comparison circuit 81, the phase-comparison output
signal passing through loop filter 82 to serve as the
control voltage for voltage-controlled oscillator 83, so
that an output signal locked to the phase of the input
signal is obtained. By using the received clock signal
as this input signal, it is possible to generate a phase-locked
clock
