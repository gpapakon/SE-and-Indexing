<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production of 
a cyclic amidine. A number of processes have thus far been proposed for the 
production of a cyclic amidine such as a 2-imidazoline 
compound. For example, JP-B-39-24965 discloses a process in 
which a nitrile is reacted with a diamine in the presence of 
sulfur for the production of a 2-imidazoline compound. This 
process has a problem because the process requires the removal 
of harmful hydrogen sulfide. JP-A-55-83753 suggests a vapor 
phase reaction of a nitrile with a diamine. This process has a 
problem that specifically limited conditions and apparatuses 
are required and the yield of the amidine product is low. 
JP-A-59- 84873 discloses a process in which a nitrile is 
reacted with a diamine in the presence of copper acetate 
monohydrate. This process has a problem because by-products 
are formed in a large amount. JP-A-3-163064 proposes the 
reaction of a nitrile or a carboxylic acid with a diamine in 
the presence of gamma-alumina or silica. This process requires 
a reaction temperature of as high as 300°C so that a specific 
reactor is required. Further, a large amount of by-products is 
unavoidably yielded. DE-A- 2154948 discloses the reaction of 
oxazoline with ethylene diamine or 1,3-propanediamine for the 
production of an imidazoline or pyrimidine compound. The use 
of oxazoline as a raw material is, however, disadvantageous 
from the standpoint of economy. This process also has a 
problem because the yield is low.  
 The present invention has been made from a 
consideration of the problems of the prior art processes 
for producing cyclic amidines. The present invention provides a process for 
the production of a cyclic amidine expressed by the 
following general formula (I): 
 
wherein R1 stands for an aliphatic group, an alicyclic 
group, an aromatic group or a heterocyclic group, X 
stands for a direct bond or a divalent organic radical 
and A and B stand, independently from each other, for 
hydrogen or an organic group, comprising the step of 
reacting a nitrile having the following general formula 
(II): 
R1CN 
wherein R1 has the same meaning as above, with a 
polyamine having the following general formula (III): 
 
wherein X, A and B have the same meaning as above, at a 
temperature of 130-250°C in the presence of a mixture of 
water with a catalytically effective amount of a titanium 
compound.  
 In the present invention, a nitrile is reacted with a 
polyamine in a liquid phase in the presence of a mixture of
