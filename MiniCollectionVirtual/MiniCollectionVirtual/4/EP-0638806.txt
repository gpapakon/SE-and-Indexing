<ABSTRACT>
An immunoassay method for the determination of an 
analyte in a liquid sample comprising a step in which 

the sample is contacted with assay reagents in a 
suitable container characterised in that the assay 

reagents include a disassociating agent added before or 
at the same time as the contact with the sample, the 

disassociating agent being one which (a) is capable of 
disassociating the antigen/antibody bond of the test to 

a significant extent, (b) is stable for the intended 
shelf life of the test reagents, (c) is soluble in the 

test reaction mixture and (d) does not interfere 
significantly with the reactions of the test when 

subsequently diluted with a second reagent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an immunoassay method for
the determination of a specific substance or analyte in
a liquid sample and to a kit which can be used to make
the determination.In many immunoassays saturation of the solid phase
by antibody or antigen limits the effective measurement
range of the assay by reducing the slope of the dose
response profile at high analyte concentrations.A further problem with immunoassays undertaken on
microtitre plates is that they are often subject to
excessive assay drift due to the time taken to pipette
samples into anything up to 96 wells. Analyte in the
first sample added is able to react with the antibody or
antigen on the solid phase for a longer period than that
in the last sample added. This can introduce a
systematic bias into the results obtained giving an
effect known as assay drift. Assay drift is a problem
particularly in assays where rapid binding of antibody to
antigen takes place. To date there has been no fully
effective solution to this problem apart from the
limitation of the number of samples assayed at the same
time, i.e. by limiting to a half-plate or to a restricted
number of strips of wells. In some instances it is
simply accepted that assays are not completely effective
because of assay drift.Disassociating agents are known to prevent antigens
binding to antibodies and this has been used in affinity
chromatography. In a well-established affinity
chromatography technique disassociating agents are used
to separate antibodies or antigens from chromatography
columns. A number of proposals have been made to use
chaotropic salts to improve various immunoassay
techniques for example in US-A-5155023 and in DD-A-297010.
US-A-5155023 discloses immunoreagents for the
release, non-specific capture and detection of
lipopolysaccharides that may be diagnostic for
microorganisms causative for, among other things
Chlamydia trachomatis or Chlamydia psittaci. DD-A-297010
discloses rosette inhibition test enhancer for early
pregnancy factor by replacing guinea pig complement with
a chaotropic anion, thereby reducing cost with
standardisation.European patent application EP-A-0 080 109 describes an immunoassay for antigens and
antibodies wherein the antigen or antibody exists in the form of an immune complex. The
assay described comprises dissociating the immunocomplex with a dissociating buffer,
capturing the antigen or antibody on a solid support, washing the solid support, filling
unoccupied sites on the solid support and carrying out an ELISA-type assay using

<CLAIMS>
An immunoassay method for the determination of an analyte in a liquid sample
comprising a first step in which the sample is contacted with at least one first assay reagent

in a suitable container coated with a specific binding reagent and a second step in which at
least one second assay reagent is added to the container to initiate immunocomplex

extent in the first step, (b) is stable for the intended shelf life of the test reagents, (c) is

soluble in the test reaction mixture and (d) does not interfere significantly with the reactions
of the test when subsequently diluted with a second reagent in the second step.
