<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle bonnet assembly includes a bonnet (10) hinged to the vehicle 
body adjacent its trailing edge (20) and having releasable latch means 

(70) adjacent its leading edge (12), the latch means (70) being secured to 
the vehicle body by a structural member (75) which will co
llapse 
longitudinally of the vehicle when a load is applied thereto due to an 

impact load applied to the leading edge (12), collapsing of the structural 
member (75) causing the bonnet (10) to move rearwardly, the hinge 

means (85; 90) being arranged to lift the trailing edge (20) upon rearward 
movement of the bonnet (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vehicle bonnets and in particular bonnets 
for motor cars. In modern motor car design, for visibility, aerodynamic and styling 
reasons, it is desirable that the bonnet line is kept as low as possible. As 
a result, there is generally very little clearance between the bonnet and 
the engine bay contents of the motor car. Consequently, the bonnet will 
provide very little cushioning effect when impacted by a pedestrian during 
an accident. According to one aspect of the present invention, a vehicle bonnet 
assembly includes a bonnet, said bonnet being hinged to the vehicle body 
by hinge means located adjacent its trailing edge, releasable latch means 
being provided adjacent the leading edge of the bonnet, characterised in 
that said latch means are secured to the vehicle body by a structural 
member which is designed to collapse longitudinally of the vehicle when a 
load is applied thereto due to an impact load applied to the leading edge 
of the bonnet, the structural member causing the bonnet to move 
rearwardly upon collapse, the hinge means being arranged to lift the 
trailing edge of the bonnet upon rearward movement of the bonnet. In accordance with the present invention, upon impact with a pedestrian, 
the vehicle bonnet is lifted to provide a clearance, so that the bonnet may 
deform to cushion the impact. The invention is now described, by way of example only, with reference 
to the accompanying drawings, in which:- 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a bonnet assembly in accordance with 
the present invention; and  
 Figure 2 shows a modification to the bonnet assembly illustrated in Figure 
1. In the bonnet assembly illustrated in Figure 1 the bonnet 10 is hinged to 
the vehicle body, by means of a pair of hinges 85 located adjacent its 
trailing edge 20. A pair of latch assemblies 70 are provided adjacent the 
leading edge 12 of the bonnet for releasably fastening the bonnet 10 in 
its closed position. The latch assemblies 70 are of conventional construction having members 
71 extending from the underside of the bonnet 10 adjacent its leading 
edge 12 and latching means 72 which will engage and clamp the 
members 71 when the bonnet 10 is closed. The latching means 72 are 
controlled by cables 73 to release the members 71 thus permitting the 
bonnet 10 to be opened. The latching means 72 are mounted with respect to the vehicle body on 
quadrilateral frame members 75. Each frame member 75 is mounted 
longitudinally of the vehicle, an upstanding side 76 of the

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle bonnet assembly including a bonnet (10), said bonnet 
(10) being hinged to the vehicle body by hinge means (85; 90) located 

adjacent its trailing edge (20), releasable latch means (70) being provided 
adjacent the leading edge (12) of the bonnet (10), characterised in that 

said latch means (70) are secured to the vehicle body by a structural 
member (75) which is designed to collapse longitudinally of the vehicle 

when a load is applied thereto due to an impact load applied to the 
leading edge (12) of the bonnet (10), the structural member (75) causing 

the bonnet (10) to move rearwardly upon collapse, the hinge means (85; 
90) being arranged to lift the trailing edge (20) of the bonnet (10) upon 

rearward movement of the bonnet (10). 
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in 
that the structural member (75) is a quadrilateral frame member located 

longitudinally of the vehicle, the corners of the frame member (75) being 
weakened in order to provide hinge points. 
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to Claim 2 characterised in 
that frame member (75) is located longitudinally of the vehicle and is 

connected to the vehicle body by an upstanding side (76), the latch 
mechanism (70) being secured to the forward end of an upper side (78) 

of the frame member (75), said upper side (78) extending forwardly and 
downwardly from said upstanding side (76). 
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to Claim 3 characterised in 
that a buffer (80) is provided at the rearward end of the upper side (78) 

of the frame member (75). 
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in 
that the hinge means (85) has a weakened portion (88) which will permit  

 
the hinge (85) to bend. 
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in 
that the hinge means (90) comprises a four bar linkage (91, 92, 93, 94), 

a first link (91) being secured to the vehicle body and a second link (92) 
being secured to the bonnet (10), a third link (93) pivotally connected at 

each end to adjacent rear ends of the first and second links (91, 92) and 
a fourth link (94) pivotally connected at each end to the adjacent forward 

ends of the first and second links (91, 92), the links (91, 92, 93, 94) 
being arranged to permit upward pivoting of the leading edge (12) of the 

bonnet (10) in normal operation and lifting of the trailing edge (20) of the 
bonnet (10) upon rearward movement of the bonnet (10) when an impact 

is applied to its leading edge (12). 
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to Claim 6 characterised in 
that a tension spring (95) acts between the pivot connection of the third 

link (93) to the second link (92) and the pivot connection of the fourth 
link (94) to the first link (91).
