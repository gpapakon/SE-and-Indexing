thin, planar, heat-exchangers (8,30,32) placed 
throughout the battery between the electrode plates 

thereof. Preferably, the heat-exchangers (8,30,32)

container (2) and the liquid passages therein will 
have an elongated cross-section in a direction 

transverse of the passage so as to provide a wide

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multi-cell 
electric storage batteries having a monobloc 
construction including a heat-exchanger as specified 
in the preamble of claim 1, for example, as disclosed 
in US-A-3,110,633. There are times during the life of a battery 
when it would be desirable to control the internal 
temperature of the battery. For example, it would be 
desirable during initial formation of a lead-acid 
(Pb-acid) battery to remove the heat generated therein 
during the formation process and thereby accelerate 
the formation process without damaging the battery. 
Moreover, in the case of traction batteries for 
electric vehicles, it would be desirable to remove 
heat from the battery pack (i.e., a plurality of 
multi-cell, monobloc batteries electrically coupled 
together) during periods of high rate charge or 
discharge and thereby prevent damage to the battery 
pack. Still further, during the charging of such 
electric vehicle battery packs, it would be desirable 
to ensure that all the individual batteries, and 
indeed all the individual cells are at about the same 
temperature so as to ensure proper charge balance from 
one cell to the next within the pack. Finally, in 
cold climates it would be desirable to pre-heat the 
battery before usage and/or to heat the battery while 
in use to achieve optimal output therefrom. Techniques used heretofore for 
heating/cooling batteries have not been particularly 
effective to evenly rapidly add/remove large amounts 
of heat from a battery. This is particularly true for 
gas-recombinant batteries which utilise 
electrolyte-immobilising, interplate separators and 
thereby prevent convection cooling of the battery  
 
incident to the circulation of electrolyte in each 
cell. It is particularly difficult to heat/cool 
monobloc batteries wherein a plurality of cells are 
housed contiguously side-by-side each other within a 
single container, which makes it impossible to 
circulate coolant (e.g., air) around the outside of 
each cell. A multi-cell, electric storage battery 
according to the present invention is characterised by 
the features specified in the characterising portion 
of claim 1. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a unique monobloc, multi-cell electric storage 
battery having a substantially planar, 
liquid-heated/cooled heat-exchanger in each cell of 
the battery which heat-exchanger has a high 
heat-exchange surface area confronting a substantial 
area of at least one plate of each cell element in the 
battery so as to add
