<ABSTRACT>
A space modulation device (10) displays an image for right eye and an 
image for left eye. An observer image display device (12) displays an image of a 

half surface of an observer's face obtained by an imaging device (14) and a 
negative-positive reversed image of the image of the half surface of the face. A lens 

(11) allows the image for right eye, or the image for left eye, to be observed to the 
right eye, or the left eye, of the observer using the image of the half surface, or the 

negative-positive reversed image thereof, as an illumination for the spatial 
modulation device (10) from the back thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display system
for displaying an image, and more particularly to a
display system for displaying a stereoscopic image for
industrial, medical, or domestic use.In a conventional stereoscopic display system, an
observer wears glasses for separating right and left
images from each other whereby right and left eyes of
the observer can selectively see right and left target
images, respectively, which are displayed on an image
screen in a time-division fashion. In another
conventional technique, a lenticular plate is attached
to an image screen so that the lenticular plate can
separate right and left images from each other and thus
right and left eyes of the observer can selectively see
right and left target images, respectively.Fig. 1 illustrates an example of the configuration
of the above-described conventional stereoscopic-image
display system, which includes glasses 60 capable of
separating right and left images from each other, liquid
crystal shutters 61a and 61b, a synchronous circuit 62,
and color CRT 63 serving as an image display device.The above first example of a stereoscopic-image
display system having such a configuration operates as 
follows. The color CRT 63 displays stereoscopic images
wherein images for right and left eyes are displayed
alternately in a time-division fashion. Under the
control of the synchronous circuit 62, the liquid
crystal shutter 61a of the glasses 60 is opened and thus
becomes transparent only when stereoscopic images for the
right eye are displayed, and the liquid crystal shutter
61b is opened and becomes transparent only when
stereoscopic images for the left eye are displayed. As a
result, an observer wearing the glasses 60 can observe
stereoscopic images for the right eye with his or her
right eye, and stereoscopic images for the left eye with
the left eye. In this way, stereoscopic vision is
provided.Fig. 2 illustrates the configuration of the second
example of a conventional stereoscopic-image display
system, which includes a lenticular plate 71 having a
large number of stripe-shaped cylindrical lenses and a
color CRT 72 serving as an image display device.This second example of stereoscopic-image display
system having such a configuration operates as follows.
The color CRT 72 displays simultaneously both
stereoscopic images for right and left eyes such that
images for right and left eyes are displayed alternately
on each half-width stripe of the lenticular plate 71.
The right eye of an observer sees only the stereoscopic 
images
