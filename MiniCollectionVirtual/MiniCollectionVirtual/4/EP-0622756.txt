<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for enhancing the quality of 
images printed by dot printers or dot displays are 

disclosed. Image irregularities caused by quantization 
are smoothed by using a set of rules to transform an 

initial pattern (Fig. 2A) into an enhanced pattern 
(Figs. 2E, 2F) for printing. The initial pattern 

(Fig. 2A) may consist of a matrix of bits representing an 
image having X dots per inch along an intended direction 

of printing. An intermediate pattern (Fig. 2B) is formed 
by replicating columns of bits from the initial pattern 

(Fig. 2A). Image enhancement rules (Fig. 2C) are applied 
to the intermediate pattern (Fig. 2B) to invert (Fig. 2D) 

one or more bits in the intermediate pattern (Fig. 2B) to 
create an enhanced pattern (Figs. 2E, 2F). The enhanced 

pattern (Figs. 2E, 2F) is printed (Fig. 2F) at n*X dots 
per inch along the direction of printing where n 
>
 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dot printers or other types
of dot display systems, and more particularly, to a method
and apparatus to enhance the quality of images printed by
dot printers or otherwise displayed by dot display
systems.Dot printers produce a printed image by depositing a
pattern of individual dots of ink upon a recording medium,
such as a sheet of paper. Ideally, if the individual dots
are sufficiently small and closely spaced, only the
overall image, and not the individual dots, are perceived
by the human eye.However, depending on the relative size of the
smallest detail of the overall image and the size of the
individual dots, certain irregularities may be perceived
due to the discrete nature of the dots and due to the
inherent nature of the printing process. For example,
undesirable stepping (quantization) and jagged edges are
generally apparent when the image consists of a diagonal
line at a slight angle to the print direction, or a
diagonal line at a steep angle to the print direction.
Jagged edges are also noticeable in images with curved
lines.Thus, what is needed is a print image enhancement
system for providing a more pleasing dot image. This
print enhancement system should meet three important
criteria. Firstly, the appearance of the final image must
be improved in most cases with only minimal degradation in 
the remainder of cases. Secondly, the print image enhancement system must
have a minimal impact on printer throughput. Thirdly, the print image
enhancement system must be low cost and compatible with existing systems.European patent application No. EP-A-0506379 discloses a method of
using a dot printer to print a final image generated from an initial pattern of bits
corresponding to an A by B matrix of bits, representing an initial image having X
dots per inch along an intended direction of printing. The method includes
equivalent steps to: forming from said initial pattern an intermediate pattern of C
by D bits wherein C>A and D>B; determining whether said intermediate pattern
matches a rule pattern, said rule pattern being one of a plurality of rule patterns;
applying at least one rule action from a plurality of rule actions, if said
intermediate pattem matches a rule pattern, to modify said intermediate pattern
to create an enhanced pattern of bits, said enhanced pattern of bits
corresponding to said final image; and printing said final image, corresponding
to said enhanced patter at n*X dots per inch along said direction of printing.According to the present invention there
