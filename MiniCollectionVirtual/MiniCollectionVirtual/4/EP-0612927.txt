<ABSTRACT>
An annular seal (61) is in intimate contact with 
interengaging male and female members (41, 51) which can 

pivot and oscillate relative to each other. At least 
one member (51) has an annular sealing surface (56,57) 

over which the seal(61)slides while remaining in sealing 
contact along its whole circumferential length 

throughout the oscillation range of the pivot joint.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pivot joint, in
particular for a vehicle wiper linkage.In an automobile vehicle, at least one windscreen
wiper is provided, driven by an electric motor by way of
a suitable linkage. Similar wipers may be provided for
a rear window and/or headlamps, for example. In each
case the space available to accommodate the electric
motor and the linkage is restricted, so that it is
usually impossible for the pivot axes of the linkage to
be parallel and co-planar. Accordingly, it is necessary
to provide pivot joints comprising two parts which can
oscillate relative to each other.Figures 1 and 2 show a known oscillating pivot joint
between two arms 1,2 of a vehicle wiper linkage. The
joint is a ball joint comprising a male member or ball
3, fixed to one arm 1 and having a pivot axis 4, and a
female member or cap 6 fixed to the other arm 2 and
oscillatable about a centre 7. An enclosed space 8
between the members 3, 6 is filled with grease. An
annular seal 9 of generally C-shaped radial
cross-section is tightly fitted on a cylindrical portion
11 of the cap 6. The resiliently flexible seal 9 is
compressed between the arms 1,2 and its free edge 
portion 12 runs on the arm 1 as the cap 6 pivots about
the axis 4. The pre-compression maintains the contact
between the edge portion 12 and the arm 1 as the cap 6
oscillates about the centre 7. The purpose of the seal
9 is to prevent the ingress of material which might
cause abrasion at the interface between the members 3, 6,
and also to prevent leakage of grease.Hitherto, the above-described ball joint has been
considered to be satisfactory. However, prolonged
testing of a vehicle wiper linkage including such ball
joints revealed a problem of increasingly noisy
operation of the linkage. An investigation of the
tested joint revealed that the increasing noise was to
be due to deterioration of the lubrication provided by
the grease.This was found to be caused by the fact that the
existing seal does not sufficiently prevent the ingress
of water into the ball joint and that this water
degrades and also gradually washes away the grease.
During the oscillation of the cap 6 (see Figure 2) the
compression of one side of the seal 9 causes a
restriction of the necessary expansion of the opposite
side so that the edge portion 12 locally loses sealing
contact with the surface of the arm 1 (the effect being
exaggerated in Figure 2). Thus water (which is commonly
present during normal operation of a vehicle wiper 
system) can periodically enter inside the seal 9.

<CLAIMS>
A pivot joint (28) for a vehicle wiper linkage
(24), comprising interengaging male and female members

(41,51), the male member (41) having a part-spherical
head (42) smoothly connected by a neck (43) to a collar

(44), and an annular seal (61) encircling the male
member (41), the joint (28) having a centre (54) about

which the members (41,51) can pivot and oscillate
relative to each other, the annular seal (61) having a

peripheral wall portion (62) and a base portion (63)
constituting a body of rotation (62, 63) of generally

L-shaped radial cross-section, the L-shaped cross-section being acute
angled, the female member (51) having an external

annular sealing surface (56,57) over which the
peripheral wall portion (62) of the annular seal (61)

slides in intimate contact during relative oscillation of the members
(41,51), the peripheral wall portion (62) remaining in

sealing contact with the annular sealing surface (56,57)
along its whole circumferential length throughout the

given oscillation range of the joint (28), the base
portion (63) of the annular seal (61) bearing against

the collar (44) and extending outwards beyond it, the
base portion (63) having an inner lip (64) which extends

towards the female member (51) and is in intimate
frictional contact with the neck (43), the lip (64)

being free to slide in relation to the neck (43). 
A joint as claimed in claim 1, in which the
annular sealing surface (56,57) comprises an annular

substantially part-spherical surface (56) having a
centre substantially coincident with the said centre

(54) of oscillation.
A joint as claimed in claim 2, in which the
annular sealing surface (56,57) includes an annular

outer extension (57) connected to the part-spherical
surface (56).
A joint as claimed in any preceding claim, in
which the female member (51) has a rim (58) at the

periphery of the annular sealing surface (56,57).
A joint as claimed in any preceding claim, in
which the peripheral wall portion (62) of the annular

seal (61) has an enlarged edge portion (66) in contact
with the annular sealing surface (56,57).
A joint as claimed in any preceding claim, in
which the female member (51) has a part-spherical internal

surface (52) engaging the part-spherical head (42) of
the male member (41).
A joint as claimed in any preceding claim, in
which the male member (41) is made of metal.
A joint as claimed in any preceding claim, in
which the female member (51) is made of plastics

material. 
A joint as claimed in any preceding claim, in
which the given oscillation range is at least 20°.
A joint as claimed in any preceding claim, in
which the given oscillation range is at most 25°.
A joint as claimed in any preceding claim,
comprising a further pair of interengaging male and

female members with an annular seal, the two male
members (41,41') ) being connected together and aligned on

the same pivot axis (47).
