<ABSTRACT>
A composite metal cooking hotplate using gas and having a 
surface (12) for receiving the foodstuffs (14); said surface 

(12) forming part of a simple plate (11), the lower surface 
(20) of which forms the top closure of a trough (16) forming 

a cavity (18) the bottom (22) of which receives the heat; 
the trough (16) contains a thermal fluid (21) capable of 

evaporating and subsequently condensing in contact with the 
lower surface (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a composite metal cooking hot-plate 
using the heat provided by the combustion of a gas and 
having an upper free surface for receiving the foodstuffs to 
be cooked. Conventional cooking hotplates are obviously widely 
known. Such conventional plates are solid, are heated on the 
underside thereof and on the topside thereof they support 
the foodstuffs to be cooked and which receive the heat propagated 
through the hotplate itself. Nevertheless, these hotplates suffer from several drawbacks, 
among which there may be cited the relatively low 
uniformity of heat transmission, the rather unsatisfactory 
speed of cooking and the fact that portions of the cooked 
food are frequently burnt. It is an objective of the invention to overcome the 
above drawbacks and this aim is achieved with a composite 
metal plate of the type described at the beginning, which is 
characterized in that it comprises a simple plate, the lower 
surface of which forms the top closure of a trough forming a 
cavity defining a bottom receiving the heat, said trough 
containing a thermal fluid capable of evaporating and subsequently 
condensing in contact with said lower surface. Further advantages and features of the invention will be 
appreciated from the following description in which there is 
related without any limiting nature a preferred embodiment 
of the invention, with reference to the accompanying drawing. The figure is a schematic cross section view on a vertical 
plane of the hotplate of the invention. A hob 2 (shown in particularly schematic form) contains 
a plurality of burners 4 through which a gaseous fluid flows 
to the outside and produces flames 6. It is contemplated that 
the hob 2 will be provided with supports 8 for supporting the  
 
composite hotplate 10 of the invention. The composite hotplate 10 comprises a simple plate 11 on 
the upper surface 12 of which the foodstuffs 14 to be cooked 
are placed. It further comprises a trough 16 forming a cavity 
18 which is hermetically sealed by the lower surface 20 of 
the simple plate 11. The cavity 18 contains a thermal fluid 21 resting on the 
bottom 22 defined by the cavity 18 itself. The bottom 22 
receives the heat generated by the flames 6 and this heat is 
transferred to the thermal fluid 21. Thus, the thermal fluid 
boils and evaporates, rising within the cavity and condensing 
on contacting the lower surface 20 of the simple plate 11. 
Said thermal fluid is preferably of the type found on the 
marketplace under the name of Dowtherm-A.

A composite metal cooking hotplate using the heat 
provided by the combustion of a gas and having an upper free 

surface (12) for receiving the foodstuffs (14) to be cooked, 
characterized in that it comprises a simple plate (11), the 

lower surface (20) of which forms the top closure of a trough

with said lower surface (20). 
The composite metal cooking hotplate of claim 1, 
characterized in that it is sized in such a way that the 

temperature of the vapour resulting from the evaporation does 
not exceed 300Â°C. 
The composite metal cooking hotplate of claim 2, 
characterized in that said sizing is achieved by a temperature 

probe regulating the gas flow so that said flow may take 
place in a preset temperature range.
