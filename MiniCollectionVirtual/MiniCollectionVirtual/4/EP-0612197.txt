<ABSTRACT>
A radiant electric heater is manufactured by a method 
which involves providing a base (2) of microporous 

thermal and electrical insulation material having at 
least one groove (9) formed in a surface thereof, and 

providing an elongate electrically conductive strip (5) 
to serve as a heating element (4). The elongate 

electrically conductive strip (5) is located edgewise 
into the groove (9) and surface pressure is applied to 

the base (2) of microporous insulation material in a 
region (11) adjacent to the strip (5) to deform the base 

(2) and to urge microporous material of the base into 
contact with the strip (5) so as to secure the strip in 

the groove (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a 
radiant electric heater and, more particularly but not 
exclusively, relates to a method of manufacturing a radiant 
electric heater for use with a glass-ceramic smooth top 
cooker. Radiant electric heaters are known in which an element of 
coiled bare electric resistance wire is supported on, and 
secured by staples to, a layer of microporous thermal and 
electrical insulating material compacted in a metal support 
dish. Such heaters are described, for example, in 
GB-A-1 580 909 and are incorporated in glass-ceramic smooth 
top cookers. Moreover, DE-A-3 527 413 describes a method of 
manufacturing a radiant electric heater by providing a base 
of insulation material having a substantially continuous 
surface and urging a heating element in the form of a 
coiled wire, by applying pressure thereto, into the 
continuous surface of the base so as to embed the coil in 
the base along the length of the coiled element to a 
certain height of the coil. The coil is non-circular, 
having a major axis and a minor axis, the major axis being 
perpendicular to the surface of the base of insulation 
material. The term 'microporous' is used herein to identify porous or 
cellular materials in which the ultimate size of the cells 
or voids is less than the mean free path of an air molecule 
at NTP, i.e. of the order of 100 nm or smaller. A material  
 
which is microporous in this sense will exhibit very low 
transfer of heat by air conduction (that is collisions 
between air molecules). Such microporous materials include 
aerogel, which is a gel in which the liquid phase has been 
replaced by a gaseous phase in such a way as to avoid the 
shrinkage which would occur if the gel were dried directly 
from a liquid. A substantially identical structure can be 
obtained by controlled precipitation from solution, the 
temperature and pH being controlled during precipitation to 
obtain an open lattice precipitate. Other equivalent open 
lattice structures include pyrogenic (fumed) and electrothermal 
types in which a substantial proportion of the 
particles have an ultimate particle size less than 100 nm. 
Any of these particulate materials, based for example on 
silica, alumina or other metal oxides, may be used to 
prepare a composition which is microporous as defined 
above. The microporous insulation typically comprises a dry 
particulate microporous material as defined hereinabove 
mixed with ceramic fibre reinforcement, titanium dioxide 
opacifier and, for high

A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that application of the pressure is effected at opposite 

sides of the strip (5).  
 
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that 
application of the pressure at opposite sides of the strip 

(5) is effected substantially simultaneously. 
A method according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the pressure is applied manually or 

mechanically by means of one or more suitable press tools
