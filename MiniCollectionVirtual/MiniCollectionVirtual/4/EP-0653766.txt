<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charging device for 
use in an inductive charging system comprising said charging 
device coupled to a source of power and insertable into a 
charging port that is coupled to a battery, said charging device 
including a magnetic core. The invention relates further to an inductive charging 
system, comprising a battery, a charging port that is coupled 
to the battery, a power source, and a charging device that is 
coupled to the power source and insertable into the charging 
port for charging the battery. Such a charging device and such an inductive charging system 
are known from EP-A-0 552 737.  
 The present invention relates generally to inductive chargers for use in charging 
electric vehicles, and more particularly, to inductive chargers having magnetic cores 
molded into charging wands thereof. Charging wands or couplers are employed as part of an inductive charging 
system and are used to charge batteries in electric vehicles. The inductive charging 
system comprises the charging wand and a charging port. The charging wand is a 
hand-held device that includes a magnetic core having a primary winding disposed in 
proximity thereto. The charging port is a device that is part of the vehicle and includes 
secondary cores and secondary windings that are coupled to the battery of the vehicle. 
The primary winding is coupled to a source of power and when the wand is inserted 
into the charging port, power is coupled from the power source to the battery of the 
electric vehicle. Heretofore, the charging wands have been fabricated such that it has been 
necessary to machine the side walls of the magnetic core prior to assembly. It has also 
been necessary to machine the cores to exact tolerances, because core dimensions can 
vary by as much as 2% depending on the core mixture that is used. For example, a 5.08 cm [2 
inch] diameter core has an overall tolerance zone of about 0.10 cm [0.04 inches]. To accurately 
machine the core to a tolerance of +0.010 increases the unit cost by 100%.  
 GB-A-1 025 448 discloses an inductive signal transfer 
device. This transfer device is used in combination with an 
oxygen supply connection to a mask or helmet in a unitary quick 
disconnect arrangement which avoids the use of metal-to-metal 
contacts. The inductive signal transfer device includes an 
inductive electrical plug and a socket connector comprising 
a plurality of closed loop transformer cores, each of which 
is split into two halves. The two halves of the transformer 
cores
