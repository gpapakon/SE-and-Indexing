<CLAIMS>
A brake pressure control unit for traction slip control, 
comprising: a master cylinder (1), at least one wheel brake 

(2) which is associated with a driven wheel and is 
connected to the master cylinder (1) through a brake piping 

(3), a pump (8) which delivers fluid to the brake piping 
(3) through a pressure line (6'') terminating at inlet point 

(E) into the brake piping (3), a separating valve (32) 
between the inlet point (E) and the master cylinder (1), a 

connecting line (30) between the reservoir (34) and the 
suction side of the pump (8) in which a traction slip 

control valve (31) is inserted, modulating valves (4, 7) 
for the modulation of the pressure in the wheel brake (2), 


characterized
 in that, at the discharge side 
of the pump, a low-pressure accumulator (15) is provided 

and connected through a lock valve (34) to the discharge 
side of the pump (8), the lock valve (34) being in the 

closed condition during a traction slip control action. 
A control unit as claimed in claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the lock valve (34) is 
switchable from the closed position into the open position 

by the pressure of the master cylinder. 
A control unit as claimed in claim 1 or in claim 2, 

characterized
 in that the lock valve (34) and 
the traction slip control valve (31) are constructionally 

united to form one 2/4-way combination valve (37).
