<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a telecommunications device for connection to an
analog telecommunications network as set forth in the preamble of the
main claim. Telecommunications devices are known in the art which have a
visual display in the form of a light-emitting diode. The most widely known
terminals with a visual display are answering machines, which signal a
received message with a flashing light-emitting diode. Such an answering
machine has a mains connection or an internal battery for making
available the operating current required to operate the flashing light-emitting
diode. Control is effected via a microcontroller. Compared with
this prior art, the telecommunications device according to the invention,
with the characterizing features of the main claim, has the advantage of
being independent of a mains or battery supply. According to the invention,
the telecommunications device comprises a circuit capable of operating a
visual display, this circuit being powered exclusively by a small quiescent
current of the telecommunications device.By the measures recited in the subclaims, further developments of and
improvements in the telecommunications device set forth in the main claim
are possible. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the quiescent
current energizes a charging/discharge circuit in parallel with a network
termination. The visual display is advantageously implemented in the form
of a light-emitting diode. In another preferred embodiment, an oscillator 
circuit is formed which is capable of powering a light-emitting diode by a
small supply current.The circuit according to the invention can be easily incorporated into
different analog telecommunications devices, such as telephone sets,
answering machines, fax machines, etc. One embodiment of the invention
will now be explained in greater detail with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:
Fig. 1shows the general structure of a telephone set; andFig. 2shows the circuit according to the invention.Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a telephone set 1 which is connected to a
telecommunications network via inputs and outputs 2. The inputs are
connected to a surge protector 3. The signal input a is connected to a
switch 4, whose associated output is coupled through a filter to a network
termination 8. The second signal input b is also connected to the network
termination through the filter and, in addition, to a signal generator 5,
which, in turn, is connected to a keypad 7, a processor 6, and a speech
circuit 9. The speech
