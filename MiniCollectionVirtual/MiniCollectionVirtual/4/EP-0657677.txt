<ABSTRACT>
A so-called stepless self-tightening clamp structure 
having a first clamping position (Figure 4) and a second non-clamping 

position (Figure 3) in which the clamping band (11) is 
under prestress of its inherent spring characteristics. To 

latchingly hold the clamp structure in its second position, one 
end of the clamping band is provided with a tongue-like extension 

(20) while the other end is provided with two longitudinally 
extending, slot-like openings (36, 35) following one another by 

way of a constriction (33), whereby one (36) of the slot-like 
openings is wider than the tongue-like extension (20) and the 

other (35) is slightly narrower than the tongue-like extension 
(20). One (36) of the slot-like openings is thereby offset in 

the radial direction with respect to at least a part of the other 
slot-like opening (36). Additionally, to enhance the spring 

stiffness, the clamping band may be provided with one or more 
longitudinally extending reinforcing groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-tightening clamp
structure, and more particularly to a self-tightening reusable
clamp structure which provides internal clamping surfaces
devoid of steps, offsets or interruptions to assure a
completely satisfactory fluid-tight connection.Self-tightening clamps, i.e., clamps made from spring
wire or spring steel band material, which are also referred
to in the art as constant-tension clamps, are known as such.
In their simplest form, such clamps, which, by their inherent
spring characteristics, normally tend to assume their closed
clamping position, consist of spring wire with overlapping,
outwardly extending ends, and the clamps are opened by forcing
the overlapping outwardly extending ends toward one
another. Once installed over a hose, the outwardly extending
ends are released and the clamp will assume its clamping
position. Self-tightening clamps made from band material are
also known in the prior art. They usually consist of a
tongue-like extension at one end and are preferably provided
with a latching device at the other end to latch the clamp in
its pre-stressed condition. The thus-opened latched clamps
are shipped to the user who will install the open clamps and
then release the latching engagement. US-A-4,305,179; US-A-4,425,681;
US-A-4,858,279; US-A-4,930,191; US-A-4,930,192;
US-A-4,996,749; US-A-5,185,907 and US-A-4,773,129 are representative
of prior art self-tightening clamps made from band
material, the last-mentioned document disclosing a clamp
structure which has the features included in the first part
of claim 1. All of these prior art clamps, however, involve
an injury danger in use owing to outwardly extending parts
thereof, not to mention lack of clamping surfaces devoid of
discontinuities, steps or offsets.The clamps described in US-A-5,203,809 represented a
significant step in the direction toward greater safety
coupled with reliable clamping action over the entire circumference.
In particular, the clamp illustrated in Figures 24 
to 30 has proved commercially successful. However, apart from
being relatively complicated and costly to manufacture, its
snap-like release from the latched position into the clamping
position occasionally produces some sparking which is unacceptable
within the area, for example, of gasoline lines
and the like. Sparking danger can be reduced with the use of
a lacquer cover layer on the surface of the clamp. However,
such lacquer layer again increases the cost of the clamp.Accordingly, it is an object of the present

<CLAIMS>
A self-tightening clamp structure (10) having a first,
released position (Figure 4) in which the clamp structure

exerts a clamping action and a second position (Figure 3) in
which the clamp structure is adapted to be latchingly held

against the inherent tightening forces, comprising clamping
band means (
11
) including a tongue-like extension (
20
) at one
end thereof having a bent-up end portion (
21
), a first slot-like
opening (
36
) in said clamping band means through which
said tongue-like extension (
20
) is adapted to slide, and
latching means in the other end area of said clamping band

means,

   characterised by an arrangement (
35, 38a, 38b
) including
a passage (
37
) in the latching means connected to an area of
engagement for said tongue-like extension (
20
) in said
second position for allowing a tool to stay in continuous

engagement with said tongue-like extension (
20
) throughout
the movement of the clamping band means (
11
) from said second
to said first position, to prevent sparking during release of

the clamp structure from said second position.
The clamp structure of claim 1, wherein said arrangement
includes a second slot-like opening (
35
) in the other end
area of said clamping band means (
11
) which is separated from
said first slot-like opening (
36
), and wherein said second
slot-like opening (
35
) has a smaller dimension in the transverse
band direction than the first slot-like opening.
The clamp structure of claim 1 or 2, wherein said second
slot-like opening (
35
) is separated from said first slot-like
opening (
36
) by constriction means (
37
), which has a minimum 
width in the band transverse direction which is smaller than

the width of the tongue-like extension (
20
) and its bent-up
end portion (
21
).
The clamp structure of any preceding claim, wherein said
tongue-like extension (
20
) has a tapered end portion (
21
)
tapering in the direction toward the free end thereof.
The clamp structure of claim 4, wherein the
width (
d
) of said second slot-like opening (
35
) is smaller
than the width (
b
) of the tongue-like extension (
20
) by such
an amount that the tongue-like extension (
20
) can extend into
the second slot-like opening (
35
) only with its tapered end
portion.
The clamp structure of claim 4 or 5, wherein the
tapered end portion of the tongue-like extension (
20
) has a
curvilinear configuration which may be part of a circle.

notch-like tool-engaging means (
22, 34
) in opposite
end surfaces of the clamping band means (
11
).
The clamp structure of any preceding claim, wherein the
first and second longitudinally extending slot-like openings

(
36, 35
) near the other end of the clamping band means are
disposed one behind the other in the longitudinal direction

of the clamping band means (
11
), wherein said two slot-like
openings (
36, 35
) are of different width in the transverse
direction of the clamping band means, and wherein a radially

directed offset (
33
) is provided in the clamping band means 
near the other end thereof in such a manner that at least one

(
33
) also includes a part of the other slot-like opening
(
36

tongue-like extension (
20
) to pass from the first slot-like
opening (
36
) into the second slot-like opening (
35
) to
thereby provide a latching action for the clamp structure in

its second position.
The clamp structure of any preceding claim, wherein said

first slot-like opening (
36
) has a width (
c
) slightly smaller
than the width of the tongue-like extension (
20
), and wherein
said tongue-like extension (
20
) has a tapering portion (R2)
at the free end thereof whose width varies from the normal

wherein the clamp structure is reusable, and wherein means

(
37
) are provided between said two slot-like openings (
36,
35

against inadvertent release to thereby effectively provide a

latching action.
