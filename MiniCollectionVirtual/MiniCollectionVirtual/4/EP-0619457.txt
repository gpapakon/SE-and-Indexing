<ABSTRACT>
A premix burner in accordance with the double-cone principle consists essentially of two hollow conical partial bodies (111, 112) fitted into each other in the flow direction, the respective centre axes (113, 114) of which are offset relative to one another. The adjacent walls of the two partial bodies form in their longitudinal extent tangential gaps (20) for the combustion air. Gas inflow openings (117) distributed in the longitudinal direction are provided in the walls of the two partial bodies. The air is guided in the tangential gaps (20) over turbulence generators (9), of which a plurality are arranged next to one another over the gap. The fuel is introduced into the gaps (20) in the immediate vicinity of the turbulence generators (9). With the new static mixer constituted by the 3-dimensional turbulence generators, it is possible to generate in the throughflow inlet gap longitudinal vortices without recirculation areas. It is thus possible to obtain extremely short mixing sections at the entrance to the burner with a simultaneously small pressure loss.

Premixing burner on the double-cone principle 
with, essentially, two hollow conical partial bodies 

(111, 112) which are interleaved in the flow direction 
and whose respective centre lines (113, 114) are offset 

relative to one another, the adjacent walls of the two 
partial bodies forming tangential gaps (20) in their 

longitudinal extent for the combustion air, and gas 
inlet openings (117) distributed in the longitudinal 

direction being provided in the region of the 
tangential gaps in the walls of the two partial bodies, 

characterized in that the air is guided into the 
tangential gaps (20) via vortex generators (9), of 

which a plurality are arranged adjacent to one another 
and preferably without intermediate spaces over the 

width or the periphery of the gap through which flow 
occurs, the height (h) of the vortex generators being 

at least 50% of the height (H) of the gap through which 
flow occurs, and in that the fuel is introduced into 

the gaps (20) in the immediate region of the vortex 
generators (9), 


a vortex generator (9) having three surfaces 
around which flow can take place freely, which 

surfaces extend in the flow direction, one of them 
forming the top surface (10) and the two others 

forming the side surfaces (11, 13), 
the side surfaces (11, 13) abutting the same gap 
wall (21) and enclosing the V-angle (a, ah) 

between them, d 
and in that the top surface (10) edge (15) 
extending transversely to the inlet gap (20) 

through which flow occurs being in contact with 
the same gap wall (21) as the side walls, 
and the longitudinally directed edges (12, 14) of 
the top surface, which abut the longitudinally 

directed edges of the side surfaces protruding 
into the flow gap, extending at an angle of 

incidence (Óúç) to the gap wall (21). 
Premixing burner according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the ratio of the height (h) of 

the vortex generator (9, 9a) to the gap height (H) is 
selected in such a way that the vortex generated fills 

the complete gap height immediately downstream of the 
vortex generator. 
Premixing burner according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the two vortex generator (9) side 

surfaces (11, 13) enclosing the V-angle (a) are 
arranged symmetrically about an axis of symmetry (17). 
Premixing burner according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the two side surfaces (11, 13) 

enclosing the V-angle (a) include between them a 
connecting edge (16) which, together with the 

longitudinally directed edges (12, 14) of the top 
surface (10), form [sic]
 a point (18), and in that the 
connecting edge advantageously extends at right angles 

to the gap wall (21) which the side surfaces abut. 
Premixing burner according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the connecting edge (16) and/or 

the longitudinally directed edges (12, 14) of the top 
surface are configured so as to be at least 

approximately sharp. 
Premixing burner according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the vortex generators (9) 

arranged adjacent to one another in the gap (20) have 
different heights (h).
