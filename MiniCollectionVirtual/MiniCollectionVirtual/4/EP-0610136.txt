<ABSTRACT>
A process for the manufacture of pure amorphous silica 
from rocks containing non-crystalline silica is 

described. The process comprises the steps of:
 

(a) dissolution of said rock in an alkaline solution comprising 
sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate, obtaining 

a solution of sodium silicate; (b) precipitation of pure 
amorphous silica by adding sodium bicarbonate into said 

sodium silicate and co-producing sodium carbonate, the 
weight ratio between SiO₂ and Na₂O in said dissolution 

step is in the range of between 0.5 to 3.0; and (c) the 
sodium carbonate sclution is transformed into crystalline 

sodium bicarbonate, by a salting out reaction with sodium 
chloride, being recycled to the process. According to a 

preferred embodiment, the alkaline solution is obtained 
by the caustification of sodium carbonate with calcium 

hydroxide. The preferred concentration of sodium hydroxide 
in said dissolution step is in the range of 4% to 14% 

by weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture 
of pure silica from rocks. More particularly the 
invention relates to a process for the manufacture of 
pure amorphous silica from rocks containing non-crystalline 
silica such as: porcellanite, diatomite, and amorphic 
quartz. Porcellanite is a typical example of a sedimentary rock 
comprising as a main compound non-crystalline active 
silica among other constituents considered as impurities. 
A typical analysis of the main constituents of porcellanite 
mineral, which exists in Israel is as follows: 
SiO₂: 69% CO₂ : 7% and Na₂O: 0.45%. Rocks containing non-crystalline silica are found in many 
places of the world. In Israel, large amounts of porcellanite 
are covering the deposits of phosphate rocks near 
Nahal Zin without being utilized. Moreover, in order to 
mine the phosphate rock large amounts of porcellanite 
have to be removed, this fact constituting a serious ecological 
problem. Active silica is known as a valuable material  
 
useful for many purposes, such as: fillers, extenders, 
adsorbents, supports, dentifrices, etc. The literature is quite abundant with many patents describing 
various approaches for obtaining active silica 
from alkali metal silicates and a mineral acid such as 
sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. According to the U.S. 
Patent Number 3,993,497, precipitated silica is obtained 
from a sodium silicate solution treated with sulfuric 
acid and aluminum containing ions. In the East German Patent Number 293,097, powdered amorphous 
silica is obtained by reacting alkali metal silicate 
solutions with an acid or acidic substances, under 
stirring and adding a mixture of cationic and non-ionic 
surfactant before reaching an electrolyte concentration 
of 0.3N. Although the known processes are yielding various high 
grades of pure silica, their main disadvantage is the 
fact that they require a relatively expensive starting 
reagent such as alkali metal silicate. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
process for obtaining amorphous silica from a natural 
rock containing it. Another object of the present invention 
is to provide a process for obtaining amorphous silica  
 
from a natural rock, using unexpensive reagents. It is 
yet another object of the present invention, to provide a 
simple process for obtaining amorphous silica of a very 
high purity from a natural rock containing it. It is a 
further object of the present invention to provide a 
simple process for obtaining amorphous silica of a
