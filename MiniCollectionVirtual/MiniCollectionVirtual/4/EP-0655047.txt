<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a bottom-dump container (1) comprising a container portion (2) having at least two bottom doors (4, 5) situated opposite each other and which are pivotably connected to the container portion (2) and fork tubes (6, 7) supporting said container portion (2), said fork tubes, when changing their relative distance by e.g. a fork truck having adjustable fork distance in the horizontal plane, admit opening or closing of the bottom doors (4, 5). Each bottom door (4; 5) has an opening line (10) which over and above its extension along a hinge (3) connecting the container portion (2) to the bottom doors (4, 5), forms a border line between adjacent edge portions of the end walls (15, 16) of the container portion (2) and the side walls (11, 12; 13, 14) of the bottom door (4; 5), said border line from an extension mainly in parallel to the bottom plane or bottom side (8, 9) of the container portion (2) is able to take a direction which runs obliquely downwards up to the lower, free edge or corner portion (24) of the bottom door (4; 5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bottom-dump container
comprising a container portion having at least two bottom
doors situated opposite to each other and hingedly connected
to said container portion and fork tubes supporting said
container portion, which when changing their relative distance
by e.g. a fork truck having adjustable fork distance
in the horizontal plane, admits opening or closing of the
bottom doors.The problems with present known containers of a similar type
are i.a. that their dumping devices require a relative large
space. Further the truck driver must often get out from the
truck in order to release the locking device when dumping
the contents out of the container. The container also often
need a stand over and above the place where the material
shall be dumped and the container only can be dumped from
one direction. The dumping time will in this way be long and
finally the locking mechanism of the container can be unintentionally
be released if an obstacle is run into. Also
other types of containers exist, the bottom doors of which
are resting upon fork tubes, which via a link arrangament is
pivotedly connected to the end walls of the containers and
which during sepatating of the fork tubes by the forks of a
truck achieve an opening up of the container, see e.g. GB-A-969
124.Thanks to the structure according to the present invention
the container portion now includes fewer parts than the
containers mentioned above and other which are common on the
market and also a much more rigid design. Furthermore the
bottom doors according the invention have been integrated
with the sides of the container, which results in that
during dumping the lower part of the container is separated
in an opposite direction so that the content is dumped very
quickly and effectively.The invention will be described below further in detail by
aid of a preferred embodiment in view of the accompanying 
drawing, in which
Fig. 1schematically shows a perspective view of a
bottom-dump container according to the present
invention where the bottom doors are in their
closed position andFig. 2schematically shows a perspective view of the
container illustrated in Fig. 1, where the
bottom doors are totally open.As can be seen from the figures the container 1 according to
a preferred embodiment according to the present invention
consists of a container portion 2 which at its lower part
comprises two opposite bottom doors 4,5, which are hingedly
connected to the container portion 2 by a hinge mounting in
the form of a hinge
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A bottom-dump container comprising a container portion
(2) having at least two bottom doors (4,5) situated opposite

to each other and hingedly connected to the container portion
(2) and fork tubes (6,7) supporting the container

portion (2), which when changing their relative distance by
e.g. a fork truck having adjustable fork distance in the

horizontal plane, admits opening or closing of the bottom
doors (4,5), 
characterized in
 that the bottom doors (4,5)
have an opening line (10), which from ends (23) of h
inges
(3) connecting the bottom doors (4,5) to the container

portion (2) defines a border line between adjacent edges of
the end walls (15,16) of the container portion (2) and side

walls (11,12,13,14) of the bottom doors (4,5); the lower
edges of the container end walls (15,16) extend straight

between the ends (23) of the hinges (3) or have a downwardly
pointed configuration; each bottom door (4;5) is formed by

at least one bottom side (8;9) against which one of the fork
tubes (6;7) is fixed, two of said side walls (11,12;13,14)

at opposite ends of and perpendicular to the bottom side
(8;9) and forming extensions of the end walls (15,16) of the

container portion (2) in the closed position of the bottom
door (4;5), and a connecting wall (19;20) connecting the

side walls (11,12;13,14) to the bottom side (8;9) and
forming lower extensions of the longitudinal sides (17,18)

of the container portion (2); and in that the extending
hinge (3) is situated between the upper portion of said

connecting wall (19;20) and the lower portions of the
longitudinal sides (17,18) of the container portion (2).
A container according to claim 1, 
characterized in

that the opening line (10) is lying with its border line in
parallel to the bottom plane or bottom sides (8,9) of the

container portion (2).
A container according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in
 that the connecting wall (19;20) of the respective 
bottom door (4;5) has a height which is about 1/3 of the

total height of the longitudinal sides (17,18) of the
container portion (2).
A container according to any of the preceding claims,

characterized in
 that respective bottom door (4;5) near
the hinge (3) comprises a cross bar (21) pivotably provided

at its side walls (11,12;13,14) for syncronizing of the
opening and closing of the bottom doors (4,5).
A container according to any of the preceding claims,

characterized in
 that the fork tubes (6,7) have a cross
section admitting these to be rotatable around the forks of

a fork truck during dumping.
