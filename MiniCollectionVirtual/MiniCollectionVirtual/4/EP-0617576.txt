<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR REMOVING PHOSPHORUS FROM MILK AND WHEY PROTEINFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to a method of removing phosphorus from condensed skim milk and whey protein using alumina.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIt is believed to be nutritionally advantageous to provide nutritional products for newborns and infants with a ratio of calcium to phosphorus that mimics the ration in human milk. Whey protein and condensed skim milk are used as sources of protein in such products, but naturally contain more phosphorus than desired.Aluminum is known to form complexes with phosphates. Classically, aluminum sulfate, commonly known as alum, has been used to remove inorganic phosphates in water purification processes. Alumina is insoluble in water, practically insoluble in organic solvents, and only slightly soluble in aqueous alkaline solutions with the formation of hydroxides. The ability of the aluminum portion of the aluminum oxide to attach to the phosphorus was the theoretical and practical basis for its initial experimental use in the reduction of phosphorus in condensed skim milk and whey protein.The method disclosed herein has been found to have utility for removing phosphorus from condensed skim milk and whey protein by exposing these substances to alumina. Methods of enhancing the phosphorus removing capacity of alumina are also disclosed. 

 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The features of the present invention which are believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The present invention, both as to its structure and manner of operation, may best be understood by reference to the following detailed description, taken in accordance with the accompanying drawings in which:Figure 1 is a graph showing the effect of alumina treatment on the calcium to phosphorus ratio in condensed skim milk;Figur.e 2 is a graph showing the effect of sodium hydroxide/sulfuric acid treated alumina on removing phosphorus from whey protein;Figure 3 is a graph showing the effect of sodium hydroxide/potassium sulfate treated alumina on removing phosphorus from whey protein; andFigure 4 is a graph showing the effect of sodium hydroxide/potassium sulfate and sodium hydroxide/calcium sulfate treated aluminas on removing phosphorus from condensed skim milk.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Condensed skim milk and whey protein concentrate samples were prepared using a nitric acid/hydrogen peroxide wet ash technique prior to the determination of calcium and/or phosphorus

CLAIMS:
1. A method of separating phosphorus from condensed skim milk comprising the steps of:
(a) providing condensed skim milk;
(b) causing the condensed skim milk to contact particles of alumina for a period of time, with the skim milk for at least a portion of the contact period having a pH in the range of about 6.0 to 6.5; and
(c) thereafter separating the condensed skim milk from the particles of alumina.
2. A method of separating phosphorus from condensed skim milk according to claim 1 wherein step (b) comprises placing alumina particles in the condensed skim milk.
3. A method of separating phosphorus from condensed skim milk according to claim 1 wherein step (b) comprises causing the condensed skim milk to pass through a structure which contains alumina particles and has at least one inlet and one outlet.
4. A method of separating phosphorus from condensed skim milk according to claims 1 through 3 wherein the alumina particles are conditioned with a solution containing a sulfate moiety prior to contact with the condensed skim milk.
5. Condensed skim milk produced by the method of any one of claims 


 1 through 3.
6. Condensed skim milk produced by the method of claim 4.
7. A nutritional product containing condensed skim milk produced by the method of any one of claims 1 through 3.
8. A nutritional product containing condensed skim milk produced by the method of claim 4.
9. A method of separating phosphorus from whey protein comprising the steps of:
(a) providing a liquid medium containing whey protein;
(b) causing the liquid medium containing whey protein to contact particles of alumina for a period of time, with the liquid medium containing whey protein for at least a portion of the contact period having a pH in the range of about 6.0 to 6.5; and
(c) thereafter separating the liquid medium containing whey protein from the particles of alumina.
10. A method of separating phosphorus from whey protein according to claim 9 wherein step (b) comprises placing alumina particles in the liquid medium containing whey protein.
11. A method of separating phosphorus from whey protein according to claim 9 wherein step (b) comprises causing the liquid medium containing whey protein to pass through a structure which contains 


 alumina particles and has at least one inlet and one outlet.
12. A method of separating phosphorus from whey protein according to claim 9 through 11 wherein the alumina particles are conditioned with a solution containing a sulfate moiety prior to contact with the liquid medium containing whey protein.
13. Whey protein produced by the method of any one of claims 9 through 11.
14. Whey protein produced by the method of claim 12.
15. A nutritional product containing whey protein produced by the method of any one of claims 9 through 11.
16. A nutritional product containing whey protein produced by the method of claim 12.
