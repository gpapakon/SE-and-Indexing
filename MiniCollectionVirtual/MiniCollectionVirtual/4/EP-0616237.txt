<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of optical fibers and 
concerns specifically a so-called optical fiber dispenser which consists of a 
cylindrical or tapered bobbin bearing an optical fiber pack in form of a 
spool. Optical fiber dispensers are used for communication between 
a launcher and a remotely operated object or vehicle such as a remotely 
operated observation aircraft or vehicle, which carries the dispenser 
and from which the dispenser pays out the optical fiber. For proper, smooth 
and faultless functioning of the payout, it is necessary that throughout the 
payout operation the residual pack, i.e. that part of the optical fiber spool 
that is still on the bobbin, must not loosen so that each turn of fiber remains 
in place in its original, slightly tensioned state until payout.  
 An optical fiber is made of at least two different materials, a 
fused silica inner part which guides the light and an elastomer coating. 
During winding of the optical fiber on the bobbin an adhesive is applied 
between the layers of the pack and between the bottom layer and the bobbin. 
In this way the individual turns of fiber in the pack are fixed so as to ensure 
that no loosening occurs prior to payout. However, experience has shown 
that where a dispenser is exposed to extreme temperatures due to different 
climatic conditions, the winding turns become loose upon cooling, due to the 
different coefficients of thermal expansion of the bobbin on the one hand 
and the fiber on the other hand which results in different rates of shrinking. In an attempt to overcome this problem, it has been proposed 
in accordance with U.S. 4,995,698 to manufacture optical fiber dispensers 
with bobbins made of an orthotrophic composite material such that the 
coefficient of circumferential thermal expansion of the bobbin matches the 
coefficient of longitudinal thermal expansion of the optical fiber and the 
axial coefficient of thermal expansion of the bobbin matches the coefficient 
of lateral thermal expansion of the optical fiber. It was suggested that in 
this way the problem of loosening of the individual turns in the fiber pack 
would be overcome. In practice, it was, however, difficult to find a suitable 
orthotrophic material for implementing the teachings of the said U.S. patent 
Moreover, the arrangement according to US 4,995,698 is inadequate for 
compensation of changes in the radial distance between the wound layers of 
the pack, which changes are due to lateral thermal expansion of the fiber and 
which cause
