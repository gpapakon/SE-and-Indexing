<ABSTRACT>
A glass-ceramic biomaterial having high strength and 
toughness, a family of glasses from which the glass-ceramic 

biomaterial can be produced, and a method of production. 
The material has a primary crystal phase of F-canasite and 

a secondary crystal phase of F-apatite. The glass family 
is SiO₂-CaO-Na₂O-K₂O-P₂O₅-F. The method may be a single 

stage heat treatment, or a two stage involving an initial 
nucleation and a subsequent crystallization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to glass-ceramic biomaterials 
containing canasite and apatite crystal phases. Glass-ceramics have been known since U.S. Patent 
2,920,971, and have been used for articles such as 
cookware, bakeware, tableware, flat cooktops, etc. Use of Li₂O-ZnO-SiO₂ glass-ceramics as a biomaterial 
(dentures) was initially proposed in "Advances in Dental 
Ceramics" in British Dental Journal, 124:361-365 (1968). Several patents disclose bio-active glass-ceramics 
mostly phosphorus-containing having an apatite crystal 
phase, a second crystal phase and a residual glassy phase. 
Apatite-phlogopite and apatite-wollastonites are clinically 
used in European and Japan. L. Hench et al. at the 
University of Floridahas attemped to develop in vivo strong 
bonds between bone and glass, said to involve formation of 
a hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) layer. United States Patents No. 4,386,162 and No. 4,397,670 
(Beall) disclose glass-ceramics containing canasite as a 
predominant crystal phase, Ca₅Na₄K₂[Si₁₂O₃₀]F₄, exhibiting 
exceptional mechanical strength and fracture toughness. It would be highly desirable and is an object of the 
invention to provide bio-active glass-ceramics having 
greater mechanical strength and toughness values than those 
found in the known bio-active glass-ceramics containing 
apatite, thus, marrying the strength and toughness of chain 
silicate glass-ceramics to the bioactivity of apatite 
glass-ceramics.  U.S. Patents 3,981,736, 4,643,982, 4,652,534, 
4,775,646, 4,536,480 and 4,536,481 do not disclose a mixed 
canasite and apatite glass-ceramic, nor canasite as a 
biomaterial. The invention resides in part in a glass-ceramic 
biomaterial having a bending strength greater than 25,000 
psi (172 MPa), a fracture toughness greater than 2.5 MPa 
m ½ (2.3 Kpsi x in ½), a primary crystal phase of 
F-canasite, a secondary crystal phase of F-apatite, a 
crystal phase structure including interlocking blades of 
F-canasite with at least a portion of the F-apatite 
crystals within the interlocking F-canasite blades, and a 
residual glassy phase. The invention further resides in a glass capable of 
being cerammed to a glass-ceramic containing F-canasite and 
F-apatite crystals consisting essentially of, as calculated 
in weight percent, on an oxide basis,
