<DESCRIPTION>
 Azo oxime ethers and their use as fungicidesThe present invention relates to novel azo oxime ethers, to processes for their preparation, to their use as fungicides as well as compositions which comprise the azo oxime ethers as active ingredients.The azo oxime ethers according to the invention are those of the formula I' 
in whichX is CH orN,R.! is hydrogen, C1-C3alkyl, trifluoromethyl or cyclopropyl,R2 is aryl or heteroaryl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents R,R is halogen; - alkyl; C3-C6cycloalkyl; CrC4haloalkyl; C1-C4alkoxy; hydroxyl; phenyl, benzyloxy or aryloxy, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by halogen,C1-C4alkyl, Cj-Cgalkoxy, trifluoromethyl or trifluoromethoxy; Ci-C^aloal oxy; cyano; nitro; mercapto; CrC4alkylthio; NR3R4; CONR3R4; cyanomethyl; SO2NR3R4; COR5 orCOOR5,R3 and R4 independently of one another are C1-C4alk l orR3 and R together with the N atom form a 5-7-membered ring which can additionally contain 1-2 hetero atoms, andR5 is hydroxyl, C1-C4alkyl or aryl.If there are asymmetric carbon atoms in the compounds of the formula I, the compounds are in optically active form. Due to the presence of the aliphatic, the azo and the imino double bond alone, the compounds are in any case in the [E] or [Z] form. Atropisomeiism 

is also possible. The formula I is intended to embrace all these isomeric forms which are possible as well as mixtures thereof, for example racemic mixtures and any desired [E/Z] mixtures.Aryl is to be understood as meaning, in particular, phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, fluorenyl or indanyl, heteroaryl is to be understood as meaning a heterocyclic group having aromatic character, such as pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, thienyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, tetrazolyl or triazolyl, or a group of this type to which benzene is fused, such as quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl or phthalazinyl, or a group of this type to which a heterocycle is fused, such as purinyl, pteiidinyl, pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridyl or napthyridinyl. Heteroaryl is furthermore a phenyl group to which a heterocycle is fused, for example quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, benzocoumarinyl, benzothiadiazolyl, carbazolyl, indolyl, indazolyl, benzothiazolyl, methylenedioxyphenyl or ethylenedioxyphenyl.Al yl groups in the above formula I and hereinafter are straight-chain or branched, depending on the number of the carbon atoms. Cj-CsAlkyl is methyl, ethyl, propyl and
