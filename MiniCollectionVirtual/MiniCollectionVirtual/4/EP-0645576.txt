<ABSTRACT>
A boxlike body (10) with a rear wall (12) and four side 
walls (14) is brought into a fixture (34) with the free edges 

(22) of the side walls pointing downwards. The walls of the 
body is filled with insulating powder by blowing the powder 

into the rear wall (12) by gaseous medium of a first pressure. 
The powder is then packed by gaseous medium of a second 

pressure, which is higher than the first pressure, being let 
into the rear wall. During the filling and packing the medium 

is let out via a filter element (24) arranged at the free edges 
(22) around these. After the filling and packing the medium is 

evacuated from the walls through the filter element (24). The 
body can then be used as a so-called vacuum insulation in a 

refrigerator or freezer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a method for filling and packing 
insulating powder in hollow walls of a boxlike body and then 
evacuating gaseous medium from the walls, so that the powder 
forms a vacuum insulation in the walls, which body shows a rear 
wall and four side walls, the body being brought into a fixture 
with the free edges of the side walls pointing downwards, which 
fixture supports against the inner and outer sides of the 
walls. Such a method is known through US patent No. 2 164 143. The 
powder is probably thought to be packed manually, at which one 
first, when one plate 4a of the rear wall is removed, by some 
tool packs the powder in the side walls. After that the plate 
4a is mounted and the rear wall is packed with powder through 
an opening 24. This method has the drawbacks that the person 
who is packing is exposed to health risks from powder flying 
around, the packing goes slowly, can easily become irregular 
and is not suited for automatized production. The object of the invention is to improve the known method 
so that the packing can take place without health risks, goes 
faster, becomes more regular and can be automatized for mass 
production. This object is obtained through the method according to the 
invention thereby that the powder is filled by being blown into 
the rear wall by gaseous medium of a first pressure, that the  
 
powder then is packed by gaseous medium of a second pressure, 
which is higher than the first pressure, being let into the 
rear wall, the medium during the filling and packing being let 
out via a filter element arranged at the free edges around 
these, after which the medium is evacuated from the walls 
through the filter element. It shall be pointed out, that it is known per se, 
through US patent No. 2 439 603, to fill and pack insulating 
particles in the walls of a refrigerator cabinet by blowing the 
particles into a rear wall by a gaseous medium and let the 
medium out via filter elements arranged around the free edges 
of four side walls. The insulation thus brought about is not 
intended to be evacuated, for what reason it is not question of 
packing the particles so tightly, that a fixture is required 
for holding the walls during the packing and that an acceptably 
small sinking in of the walls is obtained at the evacuation. An embodiment of an arrangement according to the invention 
is described below in connexion with the enclosed drawings, in 
which

Method for filling and packing insulating powder in hollow 
walls of a boxlike body (10) and then evacuating gaseous medium 

from the walls, so that the powder forms a vacuum insulation in 
the walls, which body (10) shows a rear wall (12) and four side 

walls (14), the body being brought into a fixture (34) with the 
free edges (22) of the side walls pointing downwards, which 

fixture supports the inner and outer sides of the 
walls, 
characterized
 in, that the powder (46) is filled by 
being blown into the rear wall (12) by gaseous medium at a 

first pressure, that the powder then is packed by the gaseous 
medium at a second pressure, which is higher than the first 

pressure, the medium being let into the rear wall, the medium during the 
filling and packing being let out via a filter element (24) 

arranged at the free edges (22), after which the 
medium is evacuated from the walls through the filter element 

(24). 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in, that the 
powder is supplied from a container (40), gaseous medium of the 

first pressure acting on the powder (46) in the container and 
blowing the powder into the rear wall (12). 
Method according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in, that the 
powder is packed by gaseous medium of the higher pressure being 

let past the container (40) into the rear wall (12), when there 
still is powder in the container. 
Method according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in, that the 
powder is packed by gaseous medium of the higher pressure being 

let into the rear wall (12) through the container (40) after 
its powder contents has been emptied. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in, that the medium is let out to a vacuum pump 
(28) during the filling and packing. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in, that a force is applied transversely to the 
rear wall (12), the powder in it thereby being further packed.
