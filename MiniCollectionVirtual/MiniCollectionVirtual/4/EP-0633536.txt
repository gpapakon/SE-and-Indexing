<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to machine diagnosis and maintenance 
in general, and more particularly to a diagnosis system 
and method for the purpose of predictive machine maintenance. It is currently believed inevitable that no matter how 
perfectly designed or well built a machine is, it is going to 
suddenly break down some day or the other during the course of 
its operation. At the same time, it is also feared that today's 
economical environment does not allow a business of any kind to 
afford non-availability of its machines, and makes it desirable 
to be able to avoid such sudden break-downs. The need is 
particularly sharp for example in the case of equipment tools 
in a manufacturing line. Several methods have been put in place in the past to 
try to improve on site machine availability, besides improving 
quality of the machines themselves. One such method, the most ancient one in fact, consists 
in waiting for a machine or a piece of equipment to break down, 
and to identify and replace the faulty part. This method 
disregards the possibility of predicting a breakdown, and can 
be justified only when the economic impact of a breakdown is 
minor, or when the faulty equipment can be replaced very 
rapidly, which is not often the case. Another such method consists in replacing certain parts 
of a machine or a larger assembly before these parts break  
 
down, based on an estimate of the likelihood of their breakdown 
in the near future. Since such estimates are difficult to 
ascertain, maintenance crews tend to replace parts too early, 
and therefore this method has a tendency to generate substantial 
downtime of machines to which it is applied, and to drive 
repair costs up. This method should be applied only in instances 
where the damages of potential machine failure outweigh the 
cost of additional downtime or the cost of parts. According to a third known method called predictive 
maintenance, the occurrence of the failure of a part of a 
system in the near future is being predicted, using the 
analysis by a human expert of one or several parameters of the 
system to which the method is applied. However, the time needed 
to acquire a set of data representative of the monitored 
parameters, and even more, the limited availability of the 
expert, lead to a prediction which is essentially delayed, and 
off-line. Therefore, predictive maintenance of the known type is 
unacceptable in systems having a large number of parameters 
which can change rapidly over time and need to be monitored and
