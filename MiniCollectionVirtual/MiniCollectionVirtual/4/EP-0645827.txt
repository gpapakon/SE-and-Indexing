<ABSTRACT>
An optocoupler having a transmitter chip (1) and a receiver chip (2), which are electrically insulated from each other and firmly mechanically connected to each other via an optical coupling medium (3, 4, 5), is intended to have a high coupling factor and high reproducibility, and have low spatial requirement, is intended to allow the production of multicouplers in the narrowest of spaces and to be suitable for use in housing construction types suitable for SMT (SMD). The optical coupling medium (3, 4, 5) is formed by a transparent insulating layer (4) applied onto the receiver chip (2), a transparent, structured separating layer (5) comprising electrically insulating material, applied onto the insulating layer (4), and a transparent binding layer (3), which binding layer fills up the intermediate spaces of the structured separating layer (5) and firmly connects the transmitter chip (1) to the receiver chip (2).
