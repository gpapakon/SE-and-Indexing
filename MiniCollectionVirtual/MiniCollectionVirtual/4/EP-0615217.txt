<ABSTRACT>
An electronic article surveillance system for 
detecting articles carrying or containing magnetically 

responsive markers is disclosed, which system comprises 
a transmitting antenna in the form of a large loop of 

current-carrying material through which the articles 
are passed, and one or more receiving antenna units, 

which detect the electromagnetic response of the 
markers to an interrogating electromagnetic field 

generated by the transmitting antenna.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system used for
detecting a marker within a predetermined zone. The
invention is intended primarily for use in the
detection of goods in electronic article surveillance
or anti-theft systems, but it may be used for example
in article tracking or personnel detection systems.The invention may be used for any type of anti-theft
system where a magnetic field is set up in a
predetermined zone and a specific disturbance magnetic
signal is detected, including so-called 'RF' (radio-frequency,
generally above 2MHz) systems, where the
disturbance is caused by markers including
capacitive/inductive circuits. However, the invention
is here illustrated with respect to low-frequency so-called
'EM' (electromagnetic, including electromagnetic
harmonics) systems, where the interrogating frequency
is generally below 100kHz, and where the disturbance is
caused by markers including a magnetic material with a
non-linear magnetic response.The present invention relates to the physical
configuration of the field transmission and reception
means, and it allows more efficient use of the magnetic
field over a larger volume than hitherto possible. The
configuration also allows a high degree of control over
the regions where markers can be detected throughout a
large volume.Systems of the prior art have generally used
antenna assemblies which are designed to project a
magnetic transmission or reception field pattern
outside the physical extent of the antenna, so that
people and articles move past the assembly or through a
zone which lies between two separate assemblies. These
assemblies may have transmission and reception means 
more or less co-located, as in EP 0 134 087,
US 4,769,631 and EP 0 352 513. Alternatively, two
separate assemblies may be used for transmission and
reception respectively, as in US 4,994,939, EP 0 483
786 and EP 0 414 628. In all of these systems, the
antenna assemblies are generally flat (i.e. thin, less
than about 10 cm thick and usually less that 5cm
thick), panel-like or lattice-like in shape, and with
the plane of the panel lying parallel to the direction
of passage of the people or goods. In the last three
examples cited, the transmitter and receiver
enclosures, though separate, are generally very similar
in shape and appearance, and are shaped and disposed as
described above.One disadvantage of the prior art systems is that
the magnetic field which is experienced by the marker
is relatively weak compared with that within or close
to the actual antenna assemblies, since it
