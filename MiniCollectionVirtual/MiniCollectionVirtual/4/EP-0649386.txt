<ABSTRACT>
Process according to which gases containing sulphur dioxide and oxygen are made to flow into a converter comprising a plurality of stages where the gases are placed in contact with a catalyst, means of cooling the gases between the stages, and optionally a SO3 absorption device placed between the two stages. Before the gases flow into a stage other than the first, oxygen is added to them, and simultaneously in at least one of the stages following the admission of oxygen, the temperature is brought to a level of 3 to 50  DEG C lower than the temperature normally in use, if oxygen is not added. Accordingly the conversion rate for sulphur dioxide into sulphur trioxide or the process rate of the plant, or both, are thereby improved.

Process for producing sulphuric acid from sulphur
dioxide consisting of the operations of oxidizing sulphur

dioxide into sulphur trioxide in the presence of air, and
of adsorbing the sulphur trioxide with dilute sulphuric

acid to form concentrated sulphuric acid, oxidation of
sulphur dioxide being carried out in a converter having at

least three stages in each of which the gases to be reacted
are put into contact with a catalyst, these gases passing

successively through a first, second and third stage and
possibly other stages while being cooled between the

successive stages, and oxygen being introduced into the
gases to be reacted after their passage through the first

stage and/or one of the following stages,

   characterized in that, simultaneously to each
introduction of oxygen, the temperature at which the gases

are introduced is reduced by 3 to 50°C in at least one of
the stages which follow this introduction, with respect to

the temperature ± 2°C employed in each stage, without the
introduction of oxygen.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
temperature reduction is such that, at the outlet from the

stage which immediately follows the introduction of oxygen,
the temperature is substantially equal to or lower than the

temperature ± 2°C, employed in each stage, without the
introduction of oxygen.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that oxygen is introduced into the gases before they enter

each of the stages following the first.
Process according to claim 3, characterized in that
decreasing quantities of oxygen are introduced before the

gases enter the successive stages. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that the said temperature at which the
gases are introduced is reduced by 5 to 50°C, preferably 10

to 25°C.
