<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for selectively separating out certain 
materials from within a complex matrix stream or aggregation of flowable materials, and more 
particularly to such devices which employ permeation membrane or diffusion membrane 
tubing to collect and isolate these certain materials from within the stream or aggregation. 
The present invention further relates, in one significant aspect, to membrane tubing-based 
devices useful in the detecting, monitoring and/or measuring of low-level concentrations of 
materials within a stream or aggregation, both in an on-line process environment and in an 
off-line, purely analytical context or environment. Tubular membranes have been suggested for use in this capacity in a number of 
analytical devices, and are particularly of interest for use in separating out those components 
of a complex stream which might adversely affect a gas or liquid chromatograph or other 
analytical device if one attempted to analyze the complex stream directly. Exemplary of these 
devices are those described in United States Patents No. 4,715,217 to Coyne et al. and 4,944,180 
to Tou et al., both of which are commonly-assigned and owned with the present invention. Tubular membranes have also been utilized in on-line, direct insertion systems for 
the real-time monitoring of certain low-level materials in a matrix stream of materials, but in 
limited circumstances. For example, in United States Patent No. 4,832,034 to Pizziconi et al., a 
length of capillary membrane is inserted directly into the blood stream of a patient for 
monitoring biological reactions and trends. A similar device is described in Brodbelt et al., "In 
Vivo Mass Spectrometric Determination of Organic Compounds in Blood with a Membrane 
Probe", Anal. Chem., 1987, Vol. 59, pages 454-457, wherein a membrane probe is supported 
internally over a portion of its length by the insertion of a nylon monofilament and is used in 
vivo. United States Patent No. 3,483,990 to Litle describes a membrane-based dialyzer 
device which operates externally of the patient's body, and which is coupled with a dual-lumen 
catheter to be inserted into the patient's vein. The dialyzer is comprised of a cylindrical, sheath-type 
dialysis membrane into which is inserted a helically grooved, cylindrical support core for 
providing a helical flow path for a saline carrier solution along the inside of the sheath 
membrane. A heparin/saline solution is pumped through the inner lumen of the dual-lumen 
catheter, and
