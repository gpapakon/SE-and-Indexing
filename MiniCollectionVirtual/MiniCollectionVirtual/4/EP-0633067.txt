<ABSTRACT>
The device serves to eliminate or separate materials of different density from a mixture of materials, in particular unwanted materials such as stones, pieces of wood, broken pieces, plastic parts and the like from cut-up raw compost. It has an essentially horizontal vibratory screen (14) for receiving the mixture of materials. The vibratory screen (14) performs a vibratory and/or oscillating movement directed in or against the passage direction of the unwanted materials to be eliminated. Skimming strips (27) arranged essentially transversely to the said passage direction and moving in the passage direction are provided above the vibratory screen (14). Provided below the vibratory screen (14) is a conveyor belt (4) laterally discharging the screened material falling through the vibratory screen (14). At least one blow-out orifice (12) of a blower (43) is arranged at the one front end (11) of the vibratory screen (14) discarding the unwanted materials and below this front end (11). A conveyor belt arranged at an incline is provided below the front end (11) of the vibratory screen (14) and the blow-out orifice (12) of the blower.
