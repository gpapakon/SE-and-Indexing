A process for the production of grain oriented
magnetic steel sheets having a finished strip thickness

in the range of 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm, wherein slabs produced
by continuous casting and containing more than 0.005 % to

0.10 % C, 2.5 to 6.5 % Si and 0.03 to 0.15 % Mn are first
through-heated in one or two stages and then hot roughed

and finish rolled to a hot strip final thickness,
whereafter the strips, hot rolled to the final thickness,

are annealed and rapidly cooled and cold rolled in one or
more cold rolling stages for the finished

strip thickness, the cold rolled strips being then
subjected to a recrystallizing annealing in a wet

atmosphere containing H
2
 and N
2
 with simultaneous
decarburization, the application of a separating agent

mainly containing MgO to the cold strip surface on both
sides, a high temperature annealing and lastly a final

annealing with an insulating coating, wherein

(1) the slabs also contain

0.010 to 0.050 % S,
0.010 to max. 0.035 % Al,
0.0045 to 0.0120 % N,
0.020 to 0.300 % Cu,
optionally up to 0.15 % Sn
residue Fe, including impurities,
(2) prior to hot rolling the slabs produced are through-heated
at a temperature which is 
lower
 than the
solubility temperature T
1
 of manganese sulphide, in
dependence on the particular Si content, and 
higher

than the solubility temperature T
2
 of copper
sulphides, in dependence on the particular Si

content,
(3) the through-heated slabs are then first hot roughed
to an intermediate thickness and subsequently or

immediately thereafter hot finish rolled with a
charge temperature of at least 960 °C and final

rolling temperature in the range of 880 °C to 1000 °C

7 mm, for the precipitation of nitrogen in a quantity
of at least 60 % of the total nitrogen content in the

Form of coarse AlN particles,

600 sec at a temperature in the range of 880 °C to

1150 °C, whereafter they are cooled at a cooling rate
