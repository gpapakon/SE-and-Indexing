<ABSTRACT>
Flexible gaskets are formed from blends of ethylene/ alpha -olefin interpolymers which contain long chain branching and that possess improved processability as well as low temperature resistance and resistance to staining and attack by microbes. Such gaskets do not require formulation other than the addition of color, to produce a functional product. The gaskets of the present invention do not impact negatively on the environment and are also relatively inexpensive to produce.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gaskets made from certain polymer compositions, in
particular, this application relates to flexible gaskets formed from blends of
homogeneously branched ethylene/α-olefin interpolymers, preferably those
interpolymers that contain long chain branching. Such gaskets possess improved
processability as well as improved low temperature flexibility and resistance to
microbial attack and staining.Gaskets are used in a variety of applications, for example in appliances such
as refrigerators and freezers requiring a flexible gasket for sealing the area between
the door and appliance body. One of the most commonly used materials for the
production of gaskets is polyvinyl chloride (PVC). However, gaskets composed of
PVC suffer from several disadvantages. PVC requires compounding and formulating
in order to incorporate the various additives necessary for imparting desirable
properties to the gaskets. Besides the additional time and money required for the
additional mixing steps, additives such as plasticisers can absorb spills and become
discclored. Plasticiser additives are also susceptible to attack by microbes which can
also lead to discoloration of the gasket, e.g., black stains. Furthermore, PVC gaskets
become brittle at low temperatures and cracking becomes a problem. Thus at low
temperatures PVC gaskets are difficult to install. PVC gaskets are also perceived as
having a negative impact on the environment.Thermoplastic polyolefins (TPOs) are also used in the production of flexible
gaskets. TPO's are not PVC-based (thus eliminating the negatives of PVC), but
rather are typically blends of polypropylene and low modulus elastomers, but while
these TPO's are effective in gasketing applications, they require an extra "off-line"
blending step which negatively contributes to the cost of the formulation. For the
TPO's, oils are sometimes added which can also contribute to discoloration.WO 95/05427 discloses gasket compositions useful for sealing beverage
containers, which comprise at least one homogeneous liear ethylene polymer having
a narrow molecular weight distribution. Both substantially linear ethylene polymers (SLEPS), such as those taught by
USP 5,272,236 and USP 5,278,272, and homogeneously branched linear ethylene
polymers have been proposed for flexible gaskets, however these polymers may not
be used alone for flexible gaskets, especially when using flat plate dies which are
notorious for inducing melt fracture. Even though the substantially linear ethylene
polymers have reduced
