Process for the preparation of amphoteric surfactants 
by reacting amines with chloroacetic acid or salts 

thereof in aqueous solution at elevated temperature, 
characterized in that compounds of the general formula 


 
where 


R¹
is a saturated or unsaturated alkyl radical with 7 
to 19 carbon atoms, 
R²
is a -(CH₂)
q
-, -O(CH₂)
q
- or 

 
radical (q = 1 to 3), 
R³
is a hydrogen or -CH₂-CH₂-OH radical, 
n
is a numerical value of 2 or 3 and 
p
is a numerical value from 1 to 4, 
 
are reacted with amounts of chloroacetic acid, or salts 

thereof, which are at least equimolar with respect to the 
above-identified amines, within a temperature range from 

115 to 180°C until the content of chloroacetic acids is 

<
 10 ppm. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, in a first stage, the amine is partially or completely 

carboxymethylated at 80 to 100°C. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the reaction is carried out at a temperature from 

120 to 160°C. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in  
 

that the reaction is carried out at a temperature from 
120 to 140°C.
