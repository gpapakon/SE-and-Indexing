<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to controlled molecular weight reduction 
of polymers; more particularly, it relates to a pressure homogenisation 
method, which is particularly suitable for polysaccharides. It has now surprisingly been found that controlled, reproducible 
molecular weight regulation of in particular polysaccharides, such as 
hyaluronic acid (HA), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and guar gum (GG), may 
be achieved using the technique of pressure homogenisation. The diverse 
nature of these polysaccharides, let alone other polymers, such as 
polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), suggests that the present method may be widely 
applicable, however, as the primary interest at this time concerns HA, the 
present invention will be described with particular reference thereto. HA is a linear long-chain polysaccharide comprising repeating D-glucuronate 
and N-acetyl glucosamine disaccharide units. It is species non-specific 
and may be obtained, for example, either by extraction from animal 
tissues, e.g. rooster combs and umbilical cords, (Klein, J., & Meyer, F.A., 
1983, Biochem. & Biophys. Res. Comm., 755, 400-411), or by removal of 
HA capsular material from bacterial species, e.g. Streptococcus, (Van Brunt, 
J., 1986, Biotechnology, 4, 780-782). HA from such sources exists as a 
mixture of different molecular weight species and the overall molecular weight 
is expressed as a weight average. HA has a variety of therapeutic applications, such as ophthalmic 
surgery and post-operative adhesion prevention, as well as having potential 
in a number of other areas. The key to the uses of HA is its hydrodynamic 
properties (Van Brunt, loccit), producing highly viscous solutions at low 
concentrations. The viscosity of an HA solution is primarily dependent on the 
molecular weight, as well as the concentration of the HA.  Viscosity properties may be altered by dilution of the material, 
but in many applications this is not acceptable. Proposed strategies to 
produce HA of a variety of molecular weights include selection of bacterial 
mutants capable of producing the desired HA molecular weight range or 
alteration of the physiological conditions during growth of a bacterium to 
enhance the production of a particular molecular weight range. However, 
neither of these techniques could provide both the range and diversity of 
molecular weight species required for specific applications. Alternatively, reduction of high molecular weight HA to moieties 
of lower molecular weight may be achieved by enzymic, chemical or physical
