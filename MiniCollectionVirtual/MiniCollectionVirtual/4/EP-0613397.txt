<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to flue 
gas purification and more specific to the removal of 
noxious mercury vapor or compounds from flue gases 
originating from the combustion of coal, especially 
from flue gases from coal fired power plants. In the field of municipal waste incineration it 
has within the last decades been realised that the flue 
gas resulting from the incineration must be purified to 
reduce the amount of noxious components therein. Mercury is one of the noxious incinerator flue 
gas components the amount of which it is regarded as 
essential to reduce, and several measures have been 
suggested to this effect. Thus, US patent specification 4,273,747 
(Rasmussen) discloses reduction of the mercury content 
in hot incinerator flue gases by quenching said gases 
by atomizing an aqueous liquid therein in the presence 
of fly ash suspended in the gas, which quenching causes 
a cooling from a temperature of at least 200°C to a 
temperature below 160°C. The aqueous liquid may be 
water or an aqueous solution or suspension of an alkaline 
compound. This method will obviously not be suitable 
for flue gas from combustion of coal in power 
plants since the temperature of said gas is substantially 
below 200°C, typically between 120 and 160°C. 
Besides, the chemical composition of the major impurities 
of incinerator flue gas and power plant flue 
gas are so different that the mercury sorption will be 
influenced thereby.  
 European patent application no. 0013567 (Svenska 
Fläktfabriken) also deals with a process for reducing 
the mercury content of incinerator flue gas in which 
the gas is contacted with a solid sorbent consisting of 
powdered calcium hydroxide and of reaction products 
from the reaction between calcium hydroxide and gaseous 
hydrogen chloride. The specific conditions for obtainment 
of an efficient mercury removal are not disclosed 
but an efficient mercury removal is described in 
an example in which an incinerator flue gas is treated 
apparently having hydrogen chloride as the main pollutant. In European patent no. 0 253 563 a method for 
removal of mercury and other noxious compounds from 
incinerator flue gas is disclosed in which an aqueous 
liquid containing a basic absorbent is atomized into 
the flue gas to absorb acidic components from the flue 
gas and simultaneously to evaporate the water in said 
aqueous liquid, in which process powdery activated carbon 
is injected into the flue gas and separated again 
from said gas together with particulate material
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for removing noxious components 
including sulphur dioxide and mercury from a hot flue 

gas having a temperature of 110-170°C and resulting 
from the combustion of coal having a low 

chloride content, in which process an aqueous suspension 
of a basic absorbent in a drying chamber of a 

drying-absorption zone comprising a drying chamber and 
a particle collector as well as a duct connecting them, 

is atomized to fine droplets into the hot flue gas, 
the water of said droplets evaporates leaving 

dry fine particles, and a part of noxious components 
of the gas including sulphur oxides, hydrogen 

halides and nitrogen oxides and mercury, is simultaneously 
sorbed by the droplets and the fine particles, 

whereupon the flue gas with entrained dry fine particles 
is passed to the particle collector wherein contact 

between the particles and the flue gas causes a further 
sorption of noxious compounds, in which 

the amount of chloride supplied to the drying-absorption 
zone is increased to an extent sufficient to 

improve the Hg sequestering capability of the process. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the increase 
of the amount of chloride in the drying-absorption zone 

is accomplished by increasing the chloride concentration 
in the flue gas by one or both of the following 

measures (a) adding a chloride or chlorine containing 
material to the coal before or during the combustion 

thereof, and (b) injecting gaseous HCl into the flue 
gas upstream of or into the drying-absorption zone. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the increase 
of the amount of chloride in the drying absorption zone 

is accomplished by incorporating an alkaline metal or 
alkaline earth metal salt or a solution thereof in the 

aqueous suspension of basic absorbent. 
The method of claim 1-3, wherein powdery  
 

activated carbon is dispersed into the flue gas at a 
location upstream of, into or downstream of the drying 

chamber but upstream of the particle collector. 
The method of claim 4, wherein the activated 
carbon is used in an amount of 1-100 mg/Nm³ flue gas. 
The method of claim 4, wherein 90-99% of 
the Hg content of the flue gas is removed by increasing 

the chloride content of the gas supplied to the drying-absorption 
zone to 20-150 ppm and by dispersing activated 

carbon into the flue gas in an amount of 1-100 
mg/Nm³. 
The method of any of the claims 1-6, wherein 
said increase of the chloride supply is made in response 

to the result of Hg analysis of the flue gas leaving 
the particle collector. 
The method of any of the claims 1-6, wherein 
said increase of the chloride supply is made in 

dependency of the chloride content of the flue gas 
entering the drying-absorption zone. 
The method of claim 8, wherein said chloride 
content is measured by gas analysis and/or 

estimated by calculations based on chloride analysis of 
the coal. 
The method of claim 2, wherein a chloride 
or chlorine containing material is added to the coal 

before or during combustion thereof in an amount sufficient 
to obtain a total chloride concentration in the 

flue gas of at least 1 ppm by weight. 
The method of any of the preceding claims 
wherein a total chloride concentration in the flue gas 

of 20-120 ppm is obtained.
