<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to develop further an automatic winder of this type, in such a way that the preparation of the textile bobbins is improved. This object is achieved, according to the invention, in that a chargeable or codable and erasible electronic memory chip is assigned as a carrier of product information to the respective textile bobbin in a way known per se. Monitoring means for monitoring the preparation result are present on a first preparation device for returned textile bobbins. These monitoring means are coupled to a recording device for entering the preparation result into the memory chip. On a second preparation device for textile bobbins to be fed to the winder, there is a reading device for reading the information entered as an acknowledgement of the preparation result. The reading device is coupled to control means for putting into operation the second preparation device when information acknowledging the preparation result is absent.

Automatic winder (1) with several transport loops for textile bobbins, which have 
partially common transport tracks, on which first (14) and second (26 to 28) 

preparation devices for textile bobbins returned from the winder or to be guided to 
the winder, differing in function and mode of operation and effecting complete 

preparation respectively, are arranged, whereby on the first preparation device 
(14) for returned textile bobbins monitoring means (15) are provided for 

monitoring the success of the preparation, characterised in that 

a chargeable or codable and erasable electronic chip is assigned to the 
respective textile bobbin in a known manner as a carrier of product information, 
the monitoring means (15) are coupled to a writing device (37) for recording the 
success of preparation in the chip, 
on the second preparation device (26 to 28) for textile bobbins to be guided to the 
winder there is at least one reading device (38, 39) for reading the information 

recorded as an acknowledgement of the success of preparation and 
the reading device (38, 39) is connected to control means (26' to 28', 26'' to 28'') 
for initiating the second preparation device (26 to 28) when there is no information 

acknowledging the success of preparation. 
Automatic winder according to claim 1, characterised in that the second 
preparation device comprises several stations (26 to 28) arranged behind one 

another, in that the reading device (38) is arranged in the region of the 
downstream first station (26), in that the reading device is coupled with control 

means (26') for the initiation of the first station and in that there is a control 
connection between the control means (26' to 28') of the stations, which effects a 

respectively similar sequence control of the downstream control means. 
Automatic winder according to claim 1, characterised in that the second 
preparation device comprises several stations (26 to 28) arranged behind one 

another, in that the reading device (39) is arranged in the region of the first  
 

downstream station (26) and in that the reading device is connected to control 
means (26'' to 28'') for the initiation of each of the stations. 
Automatic winder according to claim 1, characterised in that the second 
preparation device comprises several stations (26 to 28) arranged behind one 

another, in that reading devices are arranged in the region of each of the stations 
and in that the reading devices are coupled with the respective control means 

(26'' to 28'') for the initiation of each of the stations 
Automatic winder according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
second preparation device has monitoring means (32, 32') for monitoring the 

success of preparation, which have an at least indirect information connection to 
the reading device (38, 39) via which the read information on the already 

performed preparation can be conveyed to the monitoring means. 
Automatic winder according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that on using 
several autonomous second preparation devices (26 to 28) on each of said 

preparation devices a reading device (38, 39) coupled with the control means for 
initiating the respective preparation device is provided. 
Automatic winder according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that the textile 
bobbins are fitted vertically onto the mounting pins of caddies (4) and the caddies 

lie on transport belts which form the transport tracks of the winder (1) by which 
they are driven along by frictional grip. 
Automatic winder according to claim 7, characterised in that the electronic chips 
are attached onto the caddies (4).
