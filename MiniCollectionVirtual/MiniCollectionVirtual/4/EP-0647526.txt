<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to continuous ink jet 
printing and more particularly to deflection electrodes useful 
therein and methods of producing same. In continuous ink jet printing, a conductive, 
preferably aqueous based fluid is forced through a restriction at 
a relatively high pressure, creating a fine stream of liquid 
which is then broken into droplets. The resulting stream of 
droplets is selectably electrically charged and subsequently 
selectably deflected by a deflection electrode, so as to direct 
the droplet either to a target on a substrate to be marked or to 
a droplet collector. In the prior art there are known porous deflection 
electrodes formed of vitreous carbon or stainless steel which 
allow any fluid to wick into the electrode for removal later in a 
printing cycle by vacuum. Such electrodes are quite brittle and 
have a relatively low production yield. Deflection electrodes formed of sintered steel which is 
post treated at high temperatures are also known but suffer from 
non-uniform porosity. The following U.S. Patents describe various electrode 
configurations useful in fluid jet printing: 4,307,407; 
4,651,163; 4,658,269 and 4,839,664.  The present invention seeks to provide a deflection 
electrode for use in a continuous ink jet printing device and a 
method of manufacturing such a deflection electrode which 
overcome limitations and deficiencies of the prior art. There is thus provided in accordance with a preferred 
embodiment of the present invention a deflection electrode for 
use in a continuous ink jet printing device molded of powdered 
ultra high molecular weight polyethylene combined with carbon 
black and subjected to oxygen plasma treatment. Additionally in accordance with a preferred embodiment 
of the present invention, there is provided a method for 
manufacture of a deflection electrode including the steps of:
 
   combining powdered ultra high molecular weight 
polyethylene with carbon black;
 
   molding the electrode; and
 
   carrying out oxygen plasma treatment to produce a 
wettable surface on the molded electrode. Preferably the proportion of carbon black to 
polyethylene is less than 5% by weight and more preferably 
between 0.25% and 2.0% by weight. The oxygen plasma treatment may be performed either 
prior or subsequent to molding. Preferably, oxygen plasma 
treatment is performed subsequent to molding. Additionally in accordance with a preferred embodiment 
of the present invention there is provided a deflection electrode 
for use in a
