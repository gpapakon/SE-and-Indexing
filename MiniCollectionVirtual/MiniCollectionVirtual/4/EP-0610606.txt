<ABSTRACT>
A low resolution representation of a radiographic image is 
calculated and displayed to be used as a tool for defining an image 

area of interest. The image area of interest is then displayed at a 
resolution that is higher than the resolution at which the entire 

radiographic image can be displayed on a display device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of digital radiography. 
The invention more specifically relates to processing and display of 
radiographic images on a work station. In the field of digital radiography a wide variety of image 
acquisition techniques have been developed such as computerised 
tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultrasound, detection of a 
radiation image by means of a CCD sensor or a video camera, 
radiographic film scanning etc. In still another technique a radiation image, for example an 
image of x-rays transmitted by an object, is stored in a screen 
comprising a photostimulable phosphor such as one of the phosphors 
described in European patent publication 503 702 published on 
16.09.92 and US Ser. 07/842,603. The technique for reading out the 
stored radiation image consists of scanning the screen with 
stimulating radiation, such as laser light of the appropriate 
wavelength, detecting the light emitted upon stimulation and 
converting the emitted light into an electric representation for 
example by means of a photomultiplier and digitizing the signal. The digital images obtained by one of the acquisition techniques 
described hereinbefore can be transmitted to a graphic workstation 
for off-line processing or reprocessing and display on a CRT screen 
or the like. The number of pixels in the digital radiographic image is 
commonly far greater than the number of pixels that can be displayed 
on the display screen of the workstation. For example, in case of a digital radiographic image obtained by 
read out of an exposed photostimulable phosphor screen, the number 
of pixels in the digital image representation typically amounts to 
2000 times 2500 pixels or even more whereas commercially available 
display screens, for example CRT screens, can only display about 
1000 by 1200 pixels. The number of pixels in the digital image 
representation is only indicative since the number of pixels in the  
 
pixel matrix may depend for example on the dimensions of the 
photostimulable phosphor screen and may for some dimensions exceed 
this number. In any case, if a radiographic image is represented by a 
greater number of pixels than the number of pixels that can be 
displayed on the display device, the operator has to decide either 
to display only part of an image at a high resolution or to extract 
a low resolution representation of the entire image and to display 
said low resolution image representation. The latter method is satisfactory in case an operator or 
radiologist only

A method of displaying on a display device a radiographic image 
represented by a digital signal representation comprising the steps 

of 

1)-transforming said image into a pyramidal multiresolution 
representation which represents localised image detail at multiple 

scales, 
2)-storing said multiresolution representation into a memory, 
3)-defining an area of interest part of said radiographic image, 
4)-retrieving the multiresolution representation at least of said 
area of interest from said memory, 
5)-reconstructing said image area by applying the inverse of said 
transform to the retrieved multiresolution representation, 
6)-displaying said reconstructed image area. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein said pyramidal 
multiresolution representation is obtained as a sequence of detail 

images at multiple resolution levels and a residual image at a 
resolution level lower than the minimum of said multiple resolution 

levels. 
A method according to claim 2 wherein the detail image at the 
finest resolution level is obtained as the pixel wise difference 

between the original image and an image obtained by low pass 
filtering the
 original image, and wherein the successive coarser 
resolution level detail images are obtained by taking the pixelwise 

difference between two low pass filtered versions of the original 
image, the second having a smaller bandwidth than the former. 
A method according to claim 3 

wherein the detail images at successive coarser resolution levels 
are obtained as a result of K iterations of the following steps: 


a) computing an approximation image at a next coarser level by 
applying a low pass filter to the approximation image corresponding 

to the current iteration, ans subsampling the result in proportion 
to the reduction in spatial frequency bandwidth, using the original 

image as input to said low pass filter in the course of the first 
iteration; 
b) computing a detail image as the pixelwise difference between the 
approximation image corresponding to the current iteration and the 

 
approximation image at a next coarser resolution level computed 

according to the method sub 4a;both images being brought into 
register by proper interpolation of the latter image; 
and wherein the residual image is equal to the approximation image 
produced by the last iteration, 
and wherein said processed image is computed by iterating K times 
the following procedure starting from the coarsest detail image and 

the residual image: 
 
computing the approximation image at the current resolution level by 

pixelwise adding the modified detail image at the same resolution 
level to the approximation image at the coarser resolution level 

corresponding to the previous iteration, both images being brought 
into register by proper interpolation of the latter image, using the 

residual image instead of the coarser approximation image in the 
course of the first iteration. 
A method according to claim 4 wherein said subsampling factor is 
2, and said low-pass filter has an impulse response which 

approximates a two-dimensional gaussian distribution.

memory and by applying a reconstruction algorithm to said retrieved 
multiresolution representation.

reconstructed radiographic image and wherein pixels corresponding 

 
with said defined area are extracted from of said reconstructed 

radiographic image and displayed.

reconstruction step to retrieved pixel values of components of said 
multiresolution pyramidal representation at higher resolution levels 

than said predetermined resolution level.
