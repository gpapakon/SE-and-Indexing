<ABSTRACT>
A method and an interconnect package (35) for 
interconnecting electrical system components. A leadframe 

(10) having leads (11) is encapsulated within a molding 

compound to form a first section (36) of the interconnect 
package (35). The first section (36) optionally includes 

channels (54). A leadframe (20) having leads (22, 23) is 
encapsulated within a molding compound to form a second 

section (37) of the interconnect package (35). The first and 
second sections (36 and 37, respectively) are coupled together 

with an adhesive material (43). An end (44) is removed from 
the interconnect package (35) forming an edge (50). A 

semiconductor chip (51) is coupled to the edge (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to interconnect 
packages, and more particularly, to interconnect packages for 
mating with a semiconductor die. Systems used in such areas as communications, test, 
control, computation, etc. typically employ semiconductor 
devices for transmission and processing of electrical signals. 
Important factors impacting such system parameters as speed 
and thermal performance include the packages used for housing 
or supporting the semiconductor devices and the interconnect 
structures between the various systems components. One approach to improving system level performance is to 
mount the circuitry in multi-chip modules and subsequently use 
these modules to manufacture the system. Advantages of this 
packaging technique include an overall reduction in board space 
and shorter electrical paths between devices. However, 
conventional multi-chip module packaging techniques still 
require a substantial area in order to fit the semiconductor 
devices and interconnects in the module. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have a method 
and means of interconnecting semiconductor devices that are 
compatible with multi-chip module technology and that reduce 
the size of the multi-chip module. It would be of further 
advantage for the method and means to improve system 
performance by decreasing the interconnect lengths.  FIGs. 1 and 2 illustrate patterned leadframes to be 
manufactured into an interconnect package in accordance an 
embodiment of the present invention; FIGs. 3 and 4 illustrate an interconnect package during 
progressive stages of manufacture in accordance with an 
embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 5 illustrates an exploded view of the interconnect 
package of FIGs. 3 and 4, from a backside of the interconnect 
package; FIG.6 illustrates an exploded view from a backside of 
another embodiment of the interconnect package in accordance 
with the present invention; and FIG. 7 illustrates an exploded view from a backside of yet 
another embodiment of the interconnect package in accordance 
with the present invention. Interconnecting the various components found in 
electrical systems is a critical step in systems design and 
operation. The present invention provides a package for mating 
with a semiconductor chip or die and a method of 
manufacturing the package. In one embodiment, the step of 
mating is accomplished by encapsulating a portion of a 
leadframe in plastic and attaching the semiconductor chip 
directly to at least one leadframe lead.
