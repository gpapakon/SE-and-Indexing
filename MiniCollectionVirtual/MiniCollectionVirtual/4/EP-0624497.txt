<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a brake pressure reducer which is provided with a step piston (1) which closes a control valve (7) when a certain switching pressure is attained. Since the said switching pressure is not attained in a large proportion of all braking actions, long rest phases of the step piston (1) can occur under certain circumstances. The risk then exists of seals (18, 19) sticking to the metal surfaces in contact with them. This leads to increased starting friction once the switching pressure is attained in subsequent braking and the piston has to begin to move. In order to prevent the said starting friction, it is proposed that the control force (F) determining the switching pressure act on the step piston (1) only after covering a first part (s1) of the closing travel (S). As a result of this measure the step piston (1) begins to move even in light braking, so that sticking of the seals (18, 19) is reliably prevented. So that the step piston (1) moves back into its rest position after each movement, it is proposed to allow a restoring spring force (f) to act on the step piston (1) on the first part (s1) of the closing travel (S), where the control force does not yet act.
