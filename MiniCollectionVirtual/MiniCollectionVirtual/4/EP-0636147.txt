<ABSTRACT>
The method for processing of potatoes is characterized by the fact that the method is carried out in a potato processing plant, which comprises an oil separator, heating equipment and at least one enzyme reactor and which is modified in such a manner that it can also be used for processing of rape. It is not obvious that such modification is sufficiently small for achieving an economically sound method for processing of rape outside the potato season.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention comprises a method for processing of potatoes and a method
for processing of rape, flax, sunflower, soy beans, olive fruit, or other oil containing
seeds related to rape.The processing of potatoes is an old art. Potato starch and potato fodder
protein are the main products obtainable from the crude potato starting material.
Potatoes have to be processed shortly after harvesting; otherwise both the starch and
the protein are degraded. This means that a potato processing plant is only working
around 4 months a year. The remaining part of the year the potato processing plant is
shut down.Obviously, it is a desideratum to put the potato processing plant to a useful
purpose during the remaining part of the year, as this would result in a vast economic
advantage. However, so far no one has been able to solve this problem.Thus, it is the purpose of the invention to provide an economically sound
method for processing of potatoes, which is carried out in a plant, which can be used
for another useful purpose outside the potato season.Now, surprisingly, according to the invention it has been found that the
purpose of the invention can be fulfilled if the potato processing is carried out
enzymatically and if the potato processing plant is modified slightly; in this manner the
plant can be used for processing of rape, flax, sunflower, soy beans, olive fruit, or
other oil containing seeds process related to rape (for the sake of brevity this group of
oil containing seeds will in the following ordinarily be referred to as "rape"). Thus, the method according to the invention for processing of potatoes to
obtain potato starch and potato fodder protein comprising processing said potatoes in
a potato processing plant to produce potato starch and potato fodder protein is
characterized by the fact that said potato processing plant comprises heating
equipment to heat potato fruit water and potato pulp, and in which said heating
equipment is modified in such manner that it also can be used for processing rape,
flax, sunflower, soy beans, olive fruit, or other oil containing seeds related to
rape, at least one enzyme reactor to enzymatically treat said heated potato fruit water
and potato pulp and in which said enzyme reactor is modified in such manner that it
also can be used for processing rape, flax, sunflower, soy beans, olive fruit, or other oil
containing seeds related to rape to obtain protein, hull parts, fodder syrup and oil, and an
oil separator for processing rape, flax, sunflower, soy beans, olive

<CLAIMS>
A method for processing potatoes to obtain potato starch and potato fodder
protein comprising processing said potatoes in a potato processing plant to produce

potato starch and potato fodder protein wherein said potato processing plant
comprises heating equipment to heat potato fruit water and potato pulp,

at least one enzyme reactor to enzymatically treat said heated
potato fruit water and potato pulp, wherein said heating equipment and said enzyme reactor are modified in such

manner that they also can be used for processing rape, flax, sunflower, soy beans, olive
fruit, or other oil containing seeds related to rape to obtain protein, hull parts,

fodder syrup and oil, and an oil separator for processing rape, flax, sunflower, soy beans,
olive fruit, or other oil containing seeds related to rape.
The method according to claim 1, in which said heating equipment
comprises a cooker.
The method according to claim 1, in which the potato processing plant
comprises two enzyme reactors, in which one enzyme reactor is used for processing

potatoes and one enzyme reactor is used for processing rape, flax, sunflower, soy
beans, olive fruit, or other oil containing seeds related to rape.
The method according to claim 1, in which the potato processing plant
upstream the heating equipment further comprises a washer to wash said potatoes, in

which said washer is used exclusively for potato processing, a disintegrator to
disintegrate said washed potatoes, a decanter to remove potato fruit water from said

disintegrated potatoes, and a centrifugal sieve to remove potato starch from said
decanted potatoes.
The method according to claim 4, in which the potato processing plant

further comprises a nozzle centrifuge to separate the potato starch from contaminants, a
vacuum filter in which said vacuum filter is used exclusively for potato processing to

filter the potato starch from the centrifuge, and a ring dryer to dry said potato starch. 
The method according to claim 1, in which the potato processing plant
further comprises an evaporator to evaporate the enzymatically treated potato fruit

water and potato pulp and a spray dryer to dry the evaporated potato fruit water and
potato pulp.
A method for processing rape, flax, sunflower, soy beans, olive fruit, or
other oil containing seeds related to rape, to obtain protein, hull parts, fodder

syrup, and oil comprising processing rape, flax, sunflower, soy beans, olive fruit, or
other oil containing seeds related to rape in a potato processing plant,

wherein said potato processing plant comprises heating equipment to heat said rape,
flax, sunflower, soy beans, olive fruit, or other oil containing seeds related to

rape
at least one enzyme reactor to enzymatically treat

said heated rape, flax, sunflower, soy beans, olive fruit, or other oil containing seeds
related to rape, wherein said heating equipment and said enzyme reactor are modified in such a manner that they can also be used for processing

potatoes to obtain potato starch and potato fodder protein and an oil separator for separating oil from said seeds.
