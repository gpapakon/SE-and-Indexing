<ABSTRACT>
A device for electroosmotically dewatering loaded materials, including a vessel (12), two electrodes, a cathode (14) and an anode (16) forming two of the vessel walls, a system for moving one wall relative to the other according to the level in the vessel, so as to maintain a constant liquid level, and a system for translationally moving the vessel bottom (22) relative to the walls. Methods for the semi-continuous and batch operation of the device are also provided.

A device for dehydrating charged products by electro-osmosis of the type 
comprising a tank (12), delimited by a bottom (22), two longitudinal walls (14,16) and two 

end walls (18, 20); two opposed electrodes, a cathode (14) and an anode (16) delimiting the 
two longitudinal walls of the tank; means for maintaining a constant level of liquid in the tank; 

and means (106) for a substantially vertical displacement of the bottom (22) relative to the 
electrodes (14,16) between a high position, wherein the bottom cooperates in a leakproof 

contact with the electrodes (14, 16), and a low position wherein the bottom is remote from 
these electrodes; wherein the bottom (22) comprises a conveyor (104) provided at its ends 

with selective recovery means of the products obtained, the end walls are delimited by 
leakproof doors (18, 20), and the device comprises, moreover, means (28) for the continuous 

detachment of dry products accumulated on the electrodes. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the conveyor (104) comprises 
an inclined conveyor belt (124) with a line of inclination such that the low point is upstream in 

the direction of movement. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the conveyor (104) has a 
conveyor belt (124) supported by a static frame including a leakproof film (102) stretched 

over a bed (100) of an elastically deformable material so as to ensure a leakproof application 
of the said conveyor belt against the electrodes (14, 16) when the bottom (22) is in its high 

position. 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that when the bottom is in its high 
position, the conveyor belt (124) is a little higher than the lower edge of the electrodes (14, 

16) so as to ensure a leakproof sliding contact between this conveyor belt and the electrodes. 
A device according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the conveyor belt (124) 
comprises two projecting lateral guides (126) so as to ensure that the belt is kept in position 

in guide rails arranged on the frame, as well as a proper flow of the liquids.  
 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it comprises 
selective means (26) for the evacuation and recovery of the products separated by electro-osmosis. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
means (28) for the continuous detachment comprise a scraper (170) mounted on a carriage 

(146) movable in horizontal translation parallel to the electrode concerned. 
A device according to claim 7, characterized in that the scraper (170) is movable in 
vertical translation relative to the carriage in a sleeve (172) so as to ensure its self-cleaning. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the means for 
maintaining a constant level of the liquid comprise means for progressively filling the tank as 

the water runs out of this tank. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the means for 
maintaining a constant level of the liquid comprise means (60) for the automatic control of the 

displacements of one of the electrodes (14, 16) relative to the other, according to the level in 
the tank. 
A method for the semi-continuous operation of the device according to claim 9, 
characterized in that it comprises the following steps: 


positioning the electrodes (14, 16), the doors (18, 20) and the bottom (22) in such a way 
that the tank (12) is leakproof, the anode-cathode interspacing being adjusted to a value 

corresponding to the maximum separating output by electro-osmosis for the charged product 
to be processed, 
filling the tank (12) with the product to be processed, 
energizing the electrodes (14, 16), 
recovery by gravity flow of the water withdrawn by electro-osmosis, and maintaining the  
 

level of the product to be processed in the tank by the continuous refilling of this tank, 
a continuous detachment of the product on the electrode concerned so as to avoid any 
formation of a limiting layer on this electrode, 
stopping the filling once the desired dehydration rate of the whole of the product contained 
in the tank has been obtained, 
stopping the power supply for the electrodes (14, 16), 
lowering the bottom, with a complementary detachment, and operating the conveyor, 
selection and recovery of the solid product obtained. 
A method for the discontinuous operation of the device according to claim 10, characterized 
in that it comprises the following steps: 


positioning the electrodes (14, 16), the doors (18, 20) and the bottom (22) so that the tank 
(12) is leakproof, the electrodes, being at their maximum interspacing with respect to each 

other, 
completely filling the tank, 
operating the electro-osmosis means, 
recovery by gravity flow of the water withdrawn by electro-osmosis, and imparting a 
controlled approaching movement to the movable electrode so as to compensate the volume 

of the withdrawn water, the tank level remaining constant, 
continuously detaching the product on the electrode concerned, simultaneously with the 
displacement of the other electrode, 
stopping the electro-osmosis means once the desired rate of dehydration of the whole of  
 

the product contained in the tank has been obtained, 
lowering the bottom with a complementary detachment, and operating the conveyor, 
selection and recovery of the solid product obtained.
