<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide
photographic material. More particularly, it is concerned with
a silver halide photographic material used in a photomechanical
process.In the field of graphic arts, image-forming systems
which can ensure ultra-hard photographic characteristics
(especially a gamma value of at least 10) are required for the
purpose of satisfactory reproduction of continuous-tone images
or line images in halftone images.As for the method for obtaining high contrast
photographic characteristics by the use of a stable developer,
there are known methods of respectively using the hydrazine
derivatives disclosed (in a developer or a photographic
material), e.g., in U.S. Patents 4,224,401, 4,168,977,
4,166,742, 4,311,781, 4,272,606 and 4,211,857. According to
these methods, ultra-hard and high-speed photographic
characteristics can be achieved and, what is more, as it is
allowable to add a sulfite in a high concentration to a
developer, the stability to aerial oxidation of a developing
agent in the developer is improved to a great extent, compared
with that in a lith developer. On the other hand, means for reducing changes in pH of
a developer by aerial oxidation and processing of
photosensitive materials are disclosed in JP-A-62-186259 and
JP-A-60-93433 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application).However, it has be revealed that success only in
suppressing the conversion of a developing agent and the change
in pH of a developer cannot lead to steady achievement of
satisfactory photographic characteristics.As a result of analyzing the cause of the aforesaid
troubles, we have found that variation of the sulfite
concentration also has an influence upon photographic
characteristics. Since the influence of a variation of the
sulfite concentration upon photographic characteristics is
small in conventional ordinary development-processing systems,
exclusive of lith development, it is beyond expectation that
the variation of the sulfite concentration has a considerable
influence in hard-tone enhanced systems utilizing nucleation
with hydrazine derivatives.In a lith development system, a sulfite can be used in
an only slight amount. Therefore, the lith developer is
designed so as to contain a sulfite in the form of an aldehyde
adduct (including formaldehyde adduct), thereby minimizing the
variation of a sulfite concentration. In the hard gradation
system utilizing hydrazine nucleation, on the other hand, the
developer used contains a sulfite
