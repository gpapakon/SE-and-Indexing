<ABSTRACT>
In a digital AFC circuit, the frequency difference between a digital
input signal and a digital reference signal is detected. Every "k" symbols of

the signal representing the detected frequency difference are integrated and
then divided by the integer "k" to produce a quotient having an integral

part and a fractional part. To obtain a high precision AFC output, the
quotient is then rounded by shifting the fractional part so that it aligns with

a portion of the integral part and adding it to the integral part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital automatic frequency
control (AFC) circuit to be used in the demodulator of radio
communication equipment. The present invention is particularly useful for
synchronous detectors.In digital radio transmission systems, the current digital
modulation/demodulation technique such as Ï€/4-shift QPSK uses either
differential phase-shift keying (noncoherent PSK) or synchronous detection
(coherent PSK) as a demodulation scheme. In the differential phase-shift
keying, received symbols are decoded as "0" when there is no phase
difference between successive timeslots and as "1" when there is a phase
difference of 180 radians between them. In the synchronous detection, the
receiver first extracts the clock timing of transmitted signal to recover its
carrier and uses it as a reference phase for detecting the transmitted
information symbols. In the differential PSK receiver, the reference phase is
the phase of the previous timeslot which is usually contaminated with noise
and distortion, whereas, in the synchronous detector, the recovered carrier is
free from noise and distortion. Therefore, the bit error rate (BER) vs. power
to noise ratio (Eb/No) of the differential PSK receiver is higher than that of
the synchronous detector as shown in Fig. 1. Despite its high bit error rate,
the differential PSK receiver is robust to fading and easy to implement.
Because of these characteristics the differential PSK scheme is currently
preferred to synchronous detection for mobile communication systems.With the proliferation of mobile communications, there is a need to
meet future demands for high quality mobile communications. Because of
the noise-free characteristic, synchronous detection is likely to become a key 
to the future mobile communications. Although the BER vs. Eb/No
characteristics of differential PSK systems can be improved as shown in Fig.
2, no improvement cannot be expected of synchronous detectors as shown
in Fig. 3 if the frequency difference between transmit and receive sites is
grater than 2 kHz. If the symbol rate is 192 kbps and each symbol is
represented by 8 bits, the frequency difference can be compensated for with
a minimum unit of 750 Hz (= 192,000/28). Due to the presence of noise,
frequency difference of significantly higher than 750 Hz will be produced in
synchronous detectors as is seen from Fig. 3.On the other hand, digital automatic frequency control (AFC)
circuits are used in the mobile communication systems to compensate for
the frequency difference
