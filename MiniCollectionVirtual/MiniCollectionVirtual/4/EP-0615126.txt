<ABSTRACT>
A continuous-delivery fluid pumping system comprising 

independently-driven pump units, each pump unit having outlet valving 
which prevents backflow of fluid from (1) the outlet side of the pumping 

system back to the pump cylinder, and (2) from the cylinder back to the 
inlet side of the pumping system. A pressure sensor is positioned 

within each pump unit, permitting a pump unit which has been refilled 
off-line to perform compression of its cylinder contents without 

perturbation of the on-line process, and which further permits 
discrimination of the point in the compression cycle where compression 

has been completed and fluid delivery to the system will commence.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to pumping systems, particularly
systems used in liquid chromatography separations and analyses.
Specifically this invention pertains to providing liquid chromatography
systems with a solvent sourcing capability of high reliability and high
precision, and with the ability to provide time-varying compositions of
solvents with high fidelity to the user-requested values, with minimum
delivery delay time and delay volume, even at flow rates at or below 1
microliter per minute.The practice of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
generally requires that the molecular species to be separated or
analyzed be dissolved in a liquid (the mobile phase) and conveyed by
that liquid through a stationary column bed which may comprise closely
packed particles or a membrane or other matrix support termed the
stationary phase. The stationary phase presents a large surface area
which is in intimate contact with the mobile phase. Mixtures of analyte
compounds, dissolved in the mobile phase, can be separated during
passage through the column by processes of adsorption or retention,
which act differentially on the various analyte species. The
differential retention causes the analytes to elute from the column in
both a time-resolved and volume-resolved manner. The eluting analytes
will typically transit through an on-line detector, where quantitative
and/or qualitative examination of the analytes will occur.
Additionally, in preparative chromatography, the time- and volume-resolved
samples may be collected as distinct fractions, and passed on
to a subsequent process for further use. The elution behavior of analyte molecules is a function of the
characteristics of both the stationary and the mobile phase. To the
extent that the properties of the stationary phase may remain
substantially fixed throughout the analysis, variation in elution
behavior is then predominantly the result of variation in the properties
of the mobile phase. In the isocratic mode of chromatography, the
solvent composition remains substantially constant as a function of
time, and analytes in the sample will tend to elute when a prescribed
mobile phase volume has transited the column. In the gradient mode of
chromatography, the solvent composition is required to change as a
function of time, tracking a user-defined profile; in this mode,
analytes will elute in response to both the composition of solvent
delivered, and to the overall or integrated volume of solvent delivered.
It is further understood that the model

A pumping system for delivering fluid from a solvent
reservoir to a receiving system at a selected flow rate,

comprising:

a pumping mechanism including a first pumping unit and a
second pumping unit, said first pumping unit and said second

pumping unit being arranged to continuously deliver said
fluid from said solvent reservoir to said receiving system,

each of said first pumping unit and said second pumping unit
comprising,
a syringe having an input port, an output port, and a
cylinder (3a,b), a piston (1a,b) dimensioned for actuation

within said cylinder and a piston actuator in communication
with said piston to effect actuation of said piston;
a positively-actuated zero switching volume valve
(29a,b) and associated valve actuator (36a,b) selectively

operable to enable fluid communication between said solvent
reservoir and said input port, to enable fluid communication

between said output port and said receiving system, and to
isolate said syringe; and

pumping unit as a delivery pumping unit to maintain said

selected frow rate to said receiving system and to control
the other of said first pumping unit and said second pumping

unit to be off-line as an isolated pumping unit being refilled,
and to coordinate establishment of fluid

communication between said isolated pumping unit after being
refilled and said receiving system and isolation of said

delivering fluid to a common output line in order to produce
a fluid compos
ition gradient, comprising a supervisory
controller in electrical communication with the at least two
