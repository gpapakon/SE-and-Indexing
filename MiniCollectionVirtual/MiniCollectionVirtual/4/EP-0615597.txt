 JET BURNER CONSTRUCTION, HEATING APPARATUS UTILIZING THE JET BURNER CONSTRUCTION AND METHODSOF MAKING THE SAME Technical Field This invention relates to a new jet burner construction and to a new heating apparatus utilizing such a jet burner construction as well as to new methods of making such a jet burner construction and such a heating apparatus. Background ArtIt is known to provide a jet burner construction comprising a burner body means having a chamber means therein and having an inlet means leading to the chamber means for directing fuel from a fuel source therein and an outlet means leading from the chamber means and defining an outlet opening means through which fuel is adapted to issue from the chamber means to burn externally to the burner body means, the outlet opening means having a central opening part and a plurality of spaced apart opening portions interconnected thereto and radiating outwardly therefrom whereby flows of fuel respectively issuing out of the portions and the central part of the outlet opening means merge together in a turbulent manner externally of the outlet opening means, the burner construction comprising flame re-tainer means carried by the burner body means and having outer edge means extending beyond the outlet opening means of the body means to prevent flows of induced air from being created between the flows of fuel issuing from the radiating portions of the outlet opening means, the burner body means being formed of two generally similar body sections secured together in superimposed relation and each having 

 generally one-half of the outlet opening means and one-half of the flame retainer means thereon. For example, see the U. S. patent to Riehl, No. 5,035,609. Disclosure of the InventionIt is one of the features of this invention to provide a new jet burner construction which has a reduced number of parts while still providing the desired port velocity of the fuel issuing therefrom.In particular, the prior known jet burner construction of the aforementioned U. S. patent to Riehl, No. 5,035,609, has a unique flame retaining means formed of two like separate parts which must be respectively secured to the superimposed halves or sections of a burner body means for the purpose of preventing flows of induced air from being created between the flows of fuel issuing from radiating portions of the outlet opening means thereof.However, it was found according to the teachings of this invention that such flame retainer means could be uniquely formed as integral and
