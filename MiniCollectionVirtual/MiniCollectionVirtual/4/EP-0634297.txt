<ABSTRACT>
Tyre structure with radial carcass reinforcement for heavy goods vehicles and, in particular, tyre bead making it possible to have, on unmodified wheel rims, side walls the radii of curvature of which are sufficiently large to prevent premature fatigue of the reinforcing elements which constitute the carcass as a consequence of the flexing cycles which are generated by running along. The said tyre structure includes at least one bead wire (2) situated radially on the outside of the lip of the wheel rim (J) and around which the fold-back (1') of the carcass (1) is formed.

<CLAIMS>
A tyre for heavy vehicles, which is intended to be 
mounted on a rim (J) having two bead seats which are 

extended axially and radially towards the outside by 
flanges of radius R
J
, comprising in each bead (B) at 
least one bead wire (2) of inner radius R
T
 around which 
a radial carcass reinforcement is anchored by turning-up, 

characterised in that 

(a) the centre of gravity (21) of the meridian 
section of the bead wire (2) is located radially 

to the outside of the rim flange, 
(b) the bead wire (2) has a modulus of extension 
at least equal to 100,000 MPa and its clamping on 

the rim flange 
s = (R
J
-R
B
)/(R
T
-R
B
)
 is between 0.1 
and 0.9, R
B
 being the radius of the bead of the 
unmounted tyre measured in the plane perpendicular 

to the axis of rotation and passing through the 
centre of gravity (21) of the cross-section of the 

bead wire (2). 
A tyre according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the carcass reinforcement (1) is turned up axially 

towards the inside around the bead wire (2). 
A tyre according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the bead wire (2) has the centre of gravity (21) of its 

cross-section positioned axially to the inside with 
respect to the point A of the rim flange furthest 

radially from the axis of rotation. 
A tyre according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the portion (5) of the bead (B) axially to the inside 

with respect to the bead wire (2) is extended radially 
towards the axis of rotation in order to be able to  

 
come into contact with a portion of the flange of the 

rim (J). 
A tyre according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the portion (5) of the bead (B) 

which is axially to the inside with respect to the bead 
wire (2) is extended radially until it can come into 

contact with the seat of the rim (J). 
A tyre according to Claim 5, characterised in that 
the portion (5) of the bead (B) which is axially and 

radially to the inside with respect to the bead wire 
(2) includes a reinforcement element (3) having a 

modulus of extension which is at least equal to 
4000 MPa. 
A tyre according to Claim 6, characterised in that 
the reinforcement element (3) is a bead wire of 

circular cross-section of "braided" type. 
A tyre according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
at least one connecting ply is wound around the bead 

wire (3), forming two turn-ups (4) and (4') arranged 
axially to the inside of the carcass turn-up (1') and 

axially to the outside of the carcass (1), 
respectively, said turn-ups having ends the radii of 

which are greater than the radius R
T
 of the bead wire 
(2). 
A tyre according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
at least one connecting ply is wound around the bead 

wire (3), forming two turn-ups (4) and (4'), the said 
turn-ups being in part superimposed and disposed 

axially to the outside of the carcass (1) and having 
ends the radii of which are greater than the radius R
T
 
of the bead wire (2).  

 
A tyre according to one of Claims 8 or 9, 
characterised in that the connecting ply or plies are 

formed of textile or metal cords or cables arranged in 
such a manner as to form an angle of between 0° and 45° 

with respect to the orientation of the carcass 
reinforcement. 
A tyre according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the form ratio H/S of 

said tyre is at most equal to 0.6.
