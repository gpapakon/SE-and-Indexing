<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing dried products which are low in or free of fat is described. In the case of this method, the material to be dried is placed between the contact surfaces of two plates which are able to conduct heat. This method results in dried products, the structure and texture of which are comparable with those of deep-fried products and which are suitable as snacks and for other purposes.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the production of low fat to
non-fat drying-products, characterised in that the product

to be dried is placed between the contact surfaces of
two heat conducting plates heated to at least about

100°C.
The method of claim 1, characterised in
that the product to be dried has a dry matter content between

10 and 40 % by weight.
The method of claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that at least one of the contact surfaces is smooth

and consists of metal.
The method of one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that at least one of the heat transferring

plates consists of or is structured of sintered metal.
The method of one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that at least one of the contact surfaces is

of heat-resisting tissue, in particular of plastics, for
example of Teflon.
The method of one of claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that the contact surfaces have a temperature

of 120 to 200°C, in particular of 150 to 180°C.
The method of one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that, prior to the drying step, a defined

amount of fat has been applied to the contact surfaces.
The method of one of claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that the contact drying is performed with a

partially pre-fried product.
The method of one of claims 1 to 8, characterised
in that the product to be dried is a vegetable,

in particular a potato.
Low fat or non-fat dried product obtainable
by the method of one of claims 1 to 9. 
Dried product according to claim 10,
characterised in that it is a vegetable product, in particular

a potato product.
