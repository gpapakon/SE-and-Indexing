<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a counterbalancing system for doors.Counterbalancing systems for sectional doors have been employed
for many years. Common examples of such sectional doors are the type employed
as garage doors in homes, commercial and utility buildings, and similar
applications. Counterbalancing systems originally solved the need for providing
mechanical assistance in the instance of very large doors for commercial
installations and smaller garage doors for residential use, which were normally
constructed of heavy, relatively thick wood or metal components. More recently,
counterbalancing systems have been increasingly used to permit opening and
closing operations by a single person and to facilitate the use of electric motors,
preferably of limited size, to power the opening and closing of such doors.Most such counterbalancing systems utilize drums which carry cables
attached to the garage door. Commonly the drums are mounted above the frame
defining the door opening, with a drum positioned at each end of the door such
that the cables may be conveniently connected proximate the lower lateral corners
of tlic garage door. Basically, the door is moved toward the closed position,
blocking the door opening due to gravity acting on the door as it moves from a
substantially horizontal, open position above and inwardly of the door frame to 
a closed position. The path of the door in opening and closing is commonly
defined by a track arrangement which interacts with rollers attached to the
various sections of the door. The cable drums are classically interconnected with
springs in a wide variety of ways so that they are progressively loaded as the door
is lowered to prevent uncontrolled descent of the door and employ stored energy
to assist in raising the door during subsequent opening operation (see US-A-2 294 360).The prevailing type of counterbalancing system for garage doors for
homes normally having a 2.13 m (seven-foot) high door involves the utilization of torsion
springs mounted on a shaft which is coaxial with or mounts the drums. In such
systems, it is established practice to utilize cable drums having a diameter of
approximately 88.9 mm to 101.6 mm (3½ inches to 4 inches). A torsion spring or springs mounted
outwardly of the shaft has a diameter normally in excess of 38.1 mm (1½ inches) to maintain
an appropriate spring index. The drums and spring are normally mounted on a
tubular shaft having a diameter of approximately 25 mm (1 inch) which holds the springs
and transmits
