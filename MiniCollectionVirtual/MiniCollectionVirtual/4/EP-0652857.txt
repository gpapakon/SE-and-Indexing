<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for producing CCl3CF3 by catalytic isomerization. The process comprises (1) activating a micropulverized anhydrous aluminum trichloride which has a surface area of greater than 0.8 m2/g by treating it with at least about 10 g per g of aluminum trichloride of CCl2FCClF2 with agitation; and (2) isomerizing an additional amount of CCl2FCClF2 by (i) mixing said additional amount of CCl2FCClF2 with said activated catalyst with agitation to provide an initial degree of isomerization, and (ii) cooling the mixture of chlorofluorocarbons and catalyst to a temperature of about 20  C with agitation, to provide a product containing CCl3CF3 and less than about 400 ppm of CCl2FCClF2.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes using activated 
aluminum trichloride catalysts and more particularly to 
chlorofluorocarbon isomerizations in the presence of 
such catalysts. Chlorofluorocarbons have been widely used as 
refrigerants and aerosols. Concerns have developed over 
the release of various chlorofluorocarbons into the 
atmosphere. Efforts have already begun to eliminate any 
widespread emission of CCl2F2 (CFC-12) and CCl3F (CFC-11) 
due to their ability to reach the stratosphere intact. 
In recent years, increased attention has focused on use 
of perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons 
which are considered to have significantly 
lower potential for contributing to ozone depletion. Of 
particular interest to the refrigerant industry is the 
hydrofluorocarbon 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a). 
HFC-134a can be derived from the intermediates 1,1,1-trichlorotrifluoroethane 
(CFC-113a) and 1,1,1,2-tetra-fluorodichloroethane 
(CFC-114a) These intermediates 
are, in turn, the isomers of the readily available and 
chemically more symmetric chlorofluoroethanes, 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane 
(CFC-113) and 1,1,2,2-tetra-fluorodichloroethane 
(CFC-114), respectively. The isomerization of these more symmetric 
chlorofluoroethanes by treatment with aluminum 
trichloride is well documented in the art. For example, 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,925,993 discloses a process for 
isomerizing CFC-112 (i.e., CCl2FCCl2F) to CFC-112a 
(i.e., CCl3CClF2) or CFC-113 to CFC-113a by contacting  
 
the CFC-112 or CFC-113 with an activated aluminum 
trichloride catalyst. The catalyst is prepared by 
contacting the chlorofluorocarbon with anhydrous 
aluminum trichloride in the presence of selected metals. 
Reportedly, the amount of non-isomerized chlorofluoroethane 
in the product mixture can be held to less than 
450 ppm, and the catalyst can be used for eighteen 
cycles. High purity CFC-113a is an advantageous starting 
material for the preparation of high purity 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane 
(HFC-134a). More particularly, 
CFC-113a may be reacted with HF to afford CFC-114a which 
in turn may be hydrodechlorinated to HFC-134a. Unless 
an isomer separation process is employed, the presence 
of substantial amounts CFC-113 in the starting material 
would eventually lead to the production of a HFC-134a 
product containing significant amounts of 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane 
(HFC-134). It has been found that for 
many applications, the presence of significant amounts 
of HFC-134 in an HFC-134a product can
