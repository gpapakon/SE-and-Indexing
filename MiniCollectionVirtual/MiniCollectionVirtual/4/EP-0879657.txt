<ABSTRACT>
Automobile hoods and doors etc., in the form of hollow bodies, are manufactured by a method in which at least two panels, preferably of sheet steel, are held tightly together along an at least almost closed line and are formed into the hollow body with the aid of an internal high-pressure forming process. The panels are forcibly joined together. The joining process may be carried out before, during and/or after forming. Also claimed is equipment for carrying out the process comprising an upper tool (4) attached to a ram (2) which can move up and down and a lower tool (5), fastened to a press table (3), in which a supplementary tool is integrated. A lance (7) supplies pressure medium into the a between the sheets (12, 13).

Method for fabricating a hollow body such as an automobile hood,
door or the like, wherein


at least two blanks, preferably of sheet metal, are held
sealingly together along an at least almost closed line,
the hollow body is shaped by means of the internal
hydroforming (IHF) process, wherein after the shaping
the blanks held together are clinched together.
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the blanks are held sealingly
together in their border regions and are clinched in the region of

their outer flanks.
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the clinching is
performed before, during and/or after the internal hydroforming.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein at least one
further processing step is performed during the internal

hydroforming.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the further
processing steps are performed before, during, in combination with

and/or after the IHF process.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the blanks are
flanged or edge folded before being placed in the IHF tool. 
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the blanks are
flanged or edge folded in the IHF tool.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the blanks are
fixed and/or sealed in their relative position by means of adhesive

strips.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the blanks are
edge formed in the IHF tool.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, wherein the blanks are
cold welded in the IHF tool.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5 and 7 to 10, wherein the
blanks are plastically work
ed by pressing in the corner regions of
their edge folds.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, wherein blanks having
different starting thicknesses, surface treatments and or kinds of

material are used as starting material.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 12, wherein the hollow
body is fabricated from an outer skin blank and an inner carcase

blank.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 13, wherein the internal
high pressure is produced by means of a fluid.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 13, wherein the internal
high pressure is produced by means of a gas. 
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 13, wherein the internal
high pressure is produced by means of a foam.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 16, wherein the forming
medium is introduced into the hollow body by at least one pressure

medium supply system of the nature of a docking system
comprising at least one lance, mandrel or the like.
Method as claimed in claim 17, wherein the lance or the like of the
docking system is pressed from outside through at least one blank,

preferably through the inner carcase blank.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 17, wherein the forming
medium is introduced into the hollow body by means of a stationary

docking system.
Method as claimed in claim 19, wherein before further blanks are
put into the tool before its closing the docking system is connected

to the blank first inserted, preferably to the inner blank.
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 20, wherein during the IHF
process additional temporally and spatially controlled manufacturing

steps such as edge forming, punching, working the flanges by
pressing, edge folding, preembossing and/or precutting are

performed in one and the same tool.
Method as claimed in claim 21, wherein the punching takes place
"outwards".
Method as claimed in claim 21, wherein the punching takes place
"inwards". 
Method as claimed in claim 21, wherein the punching takes place
"with the slug remaining on the component".
Method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 24, wherein shaping of the
hollow body takes place against a fixed boundary and/or moveable

counter-pressure parts.
Apparatus for making hollow bodies, preferably components
constructed from blanks, comprising a tool upper part (4)

connected to an upwardly and downwardly moveable slide (2) and a
tool lower part (5) fixed on a press table (3), and additional tools

integrated therein, and a pressure medium supply docking system
(6) 
characterized by
 an at least two-part tool lower part which is
laterally overlapped by the tool upper part (4) and consists of a

draw ring (22) and a draw punch (21).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 26, wherein the draw ring (22) is
provided with a collar (22a) directed towards the upper tool part

(4).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 27, wherein at least one docking
position (C) is provided in the collar (22a) of the stationary draw

ring (22).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 28, further comprising at least one
venting docking position (B) and at least one filling docking position

(C).
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 26 to 29, further comprising a
bushing (26) yieldingly mounted in the collar (22a) and having an

internal screw thread to receive a hollow screw (27) having a 
conical widening head (27a) shaped to correspond to a countersink

(25a) in the bushing (26).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 30, wherein at the transition at the
front end between the bushing (26) and the draw ring collar (22a)
