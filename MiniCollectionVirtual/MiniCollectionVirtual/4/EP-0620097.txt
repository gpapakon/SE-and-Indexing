<ABSTRACT>
To provide a resin molding method and apparatus that may 
realize a sprue runnerless system with a very simple structure 

and at a low cost, a molten resin (4) is fed from a resin 
supply portion (1) into a pair of cavities (3) through a resin 

passage (2) such as a sprue portion (2A) and a pair of runner 
portions (2B) for molding the resin. The method includes the 

following steps of: moving a resin return member (5) toward the 
resin supply portion (1) after supplying the molten resin (4) 

into the cavities (3), the resin return member (5) being 
disposed so as to be projectable into the resin passage (2) and 

movable through the resin passage (2); and returning a waste 
molded resin (6) under a molten/solid condition within the 

resin passage (2) back into the resin supply portion (1) under 
a molten condition by the heat of the resin supply portion (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin molding method 
and a resin molding apparatus for molding resin by feeding 
molten resin into a cavity through molten-resin passages such 
as a sprue portion and a runner portion from a resin supply 
portion. In a conventional molding process, an injection nozzle 
(i.e., molten-resin supply portion) is provided at an end of a 
cylinder and the molten resin held within the cylinder is 
supplied from the injection nozzle into a cavity through 
molten-resin passages such as a sprue portion, a gate portion 
and a runner portion. Then, an interior of the cavity is 
cooled down to a predetermined temperature so that the resin 
held within the cavity is solidified or cured to produce a 
molded article. Subsequently, molding dies are separated to 
open the cavity and the molded article is removed away from 
the cavity. In this case, in the conventional molding process, an 
unnecessary additional material which is molded in the molten-resin 
paths and which is referred to as a runner (i.e., a 
sprue runner) is unavoidable at the time when the molded 
article is removed. Conventionally, since the "runner" is wasted, in order to 
save the material, the runner is pulverized and reused. However, a runner removal work and a sorting work to sort 
the runner and the molded article are so troublesome and a 
recycle system is very complicated. For this reason, a so-called hot runner system has been 
developed in which the molten-resin paths are always heated in  
 
molding, and the runner is forcibly caused not to be 
solidified so that the runner is not discharged. However, in the runnerless system such as the hot runner 
system, since the heating means has to be provided around the 
cavity which should be intrinsically or inherently to be 
cooled, a heat-insulating structure has to be interposed 
between the heating means and the cavity, as a result of which 
a total cost is unduly increased. This system is not 
practical. Accordingly, in general, the former system has been 
widely used in which the runner is removed and reused for 
molding. Accordingly, in view of the above-noted difficulties, an 
object of the present invention is to provide a unique, 
excellent molten resin molding machine and a method therefor, 
in which a runner is not discharged with a very simple means 
without depending only upon a heating means such as a hot 
runner sub-system. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
resin molding method in which molten resin is fed from a resin 
supply
