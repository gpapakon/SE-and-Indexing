<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The braking hysteresis impairs the response of a brake and hence the control performance of a braking power-controlled brake system. A known method reduces the brake application energy in stages when the actual braking power is too high, until the braking hysteresis is overcome and the target braking power is attained. 2.2 The invention proposes, in the event of an excessive actual braking power BI, to reduce the brake application energy ZS by a value (HyS + W), which is made up of the braking hysteresis HyS assigned to the target braking power and an effective decrease W. This method results in accelerated attainment of the target braking power BS. 2.3 Brake systems in motor vehicle engineering are a preferred sphere of application of the invention.

A method for adjusting a brake value (B) to a 
desired brake value BS,
 
in which the brake value (B) is produced by a brake 

system having at least one brake (12, 13) on admission 
of application energy (Z) to the brake (12, 13),
 
wherein the brake value (B), as a function of the 

application energy (Z), runs for the brake actuation on 
the one hand and the brake release on the other hand 

according to different characteristics (U, T), the 
difference of which for a given brake value (B) is the 

hysteresis (Hy) of the brake system,
 
characterized in that
 
if, after an increase in the application energy (Z), 

the actual brake value BI shows a deviation with 
respect to the desired brake value BS in the direction 

of higher brake values (B), the existing application 
energ
y ZS is decreased by a value (HyS+W) which 
consists of the hysteresis Hys associated with the 

desired brake value BS and a variable to be denoted as 
the effective drop W. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the presence of a deviation (BI-BS) is recognized 

only from a predetermined threshold value L of the same 
onwards. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the effective drop W depends at 

least on the magnitude of the deviation (BI-BS). 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the application energy (Z), 

whenever a residual deviation (BIE1-BS) is still  
 

present after decrease thereof, is further decreased in 
steps until the desired brake value BS is set. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that if, on actuation of the brake in 

a braking operation after the decrease in the existing 
application energy ZS, a residual deviation (BIE1-BS) 

is still present, in the next braking operation in 
which a deviation (BI-BS) of the original kind occurs 

there is specified a new hysteresis HyG, which derives 
from an increase by a correction value G in the 

hysteresis HyS associated with the desired brake value 
BS. 
A method according to claim 5, characterized in 
that if, in the said next braking operation after the 

decrease in the existing application energy ZS using 
the new hysteresis HyG, a residual deviation (BIE1-BS) 

is still present, in at least one further braking 
operation, in which a deviation (BI-BS) of the original 

kind occurs, the use of the correction value G is 
repeated until the decrease using the new hysteresis 

HyG in each case results in setting of the respective 
desired brake value BS. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that if, on actuation of the brake in 

a braking operation after the decrease in the existing 
application energy ZS, there is a deviation (BS-BIE2)

value BS in the direction of smaller brake values (B), 

in the next braking operation in which a deviation (BI-BS) 
of the original kind occurs there is specified a 

new hysteresis HyV, which derives from a reduction by a 
correction value V of the hysteresis HyS associated 

with the desired brake value BS.  
 
A method according to claim 7, characterized in 
that if, in the said next braking operation after the 

decrease in the existing application energy ZS using

deviates from the desired brake value BS in the 
direction of smaller brake values (B), in at least one 

further braking operation in which a deviation (BI-BS) 
of the original kind occurs the use of the correction 

value V is repeated until the decrease using the new 
hysteresis HyV in each case results in setting of the 

respective desired brake value. 
A brake system for implementing the method

which, in addition to the at least one brake (12, 13), 

comprises
 
a brake value transducer (2) supplying an electrical 

desired brake value signal,
 
a brake value sensor (1) supplying an electrical actual 

brake value signal,
 
an electrically controlled energy distributor (11) and 

control electronics (4) connected on the input side to 
the brake value transducer (2) and the brake value 

sensor (1) and on the output side to a control part 
(14) of the energy distributor (11), which control 

electronics compare the actual brake value signal with 
the desired brake value signal and supply to the 

control part (14) of the energy distributor (11) an 
application energy signal at least co-determined by 

that comparison,

control electronics (4) are designed so that if, after 

a rise in the application energy signal, they ascertain 
a deviation of the actual brake value BI from the

deviation (BI-BS) occurs they decrease the application 
energy signal by a value corresponding to the use of a 

hysteresis HyG enlarged by a correction value G, and

follow a braking operation in which a residual 
deviation has appeared, until the decrease results in 

setting of the respective desired brake value BS.
