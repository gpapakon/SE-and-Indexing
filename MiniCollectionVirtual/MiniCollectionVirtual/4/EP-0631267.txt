<ABSTRACT>
A hazard signalling device for motor vehicles 
comprises: a sensor (1) of mechanical phenomena 

deriving from sudden changes in speed and unusual 
inclinations of a vehicle which exceed a prefixed 

degree, and which provide in output an electrical 
signal (E) on sensing such phenomena; a 

transmitter (2) for transmitting a radio-signal 
linked to the sensor (1); a receiver (3) for 

receiving a signal, acting on a same channel as a 
transmission channel used by the transmitter (2); 

a signaller (4) linked to at least the receiver 
(3) and being activated together with said 

receiver (3); an automatic commutator (5) which, 
on a command received from the sensor (1) switch 

the device from a first, stand-by configuration 
wherein the receiver (3) is activated into a 

second, alarm configuration wherein the 
transmitter (2) is activated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hazard warning device 
for motor vehicles. More precisely, the invention relates to the field 
of road accident or hazard signalling devices. In 
the field of road safety much has been done in the 
attempt to provide timely means for communicating 
hazard warning to road users. Obviously the 
principal hazard is an actual accident, but 
attention has also been paid to other dangers such 
as sudden hold-ups, bottlenecks and other 
situations leading to safety risks. Known-type signalling systems generally comprise a 
first transmitting unit, provided with or 
associated to manual activating means or danger 
sensing means, and a second unit for receiving 
signals from the first unit through a transmission 
channel. Frequently the receiver and transmitter 
are united in a single apparatus so that both 
needs can be served. Obviously the prior art offers many configurations  
 
of the above components. In some cases systems 
have been provided wherein the transmitting and 
receiving units are localized, the first at 
important points on a road and the second on board 
a vehicle, such that vehicles approaching a black 
spot can be advised as to viability. Other solutions propose on-board systems whereby 
vehicles can communicate with each other. One such 
invention is disclosed in US 3,876,940 wherein one 
vehicle (normally a road salvage and/or first aid 
vehicle) emits an alarm signal, while the 
receiving set is in fact none other than a normal 
car radio. In another solution, disclosed in DE 3,535,833, a 
vehicle can identify the position and direction of 
a first aid or salvage vehicle thanks to a 
recognition system whereby the latter vehicle 
emits a signal which the former is able to 
pinpoint exactly using a technique based on the 
classic four cardinal points of the compass. US 3,997,868, like the above-mentioned 
publication, provides means for determining the 
direction of approach of a first aid or salvage 
vehicle. US 4,764,978 provides a system where the approach  
 
of an aid vehicle is signalled to other road users 
by interrupting the car radios in the interested 
area. While all of these solutions address the problem 
of signalling a hazard, none of them solves the 
question of identifying a hazard. Another solution proposes a system wherein a 
plurality of microswitches positioned at various 
points in a vehicle act on a hazard signalling 
circuit connected to a radio transmission set. A 
drawback of this system is that in order for a 
hazard signal to be
