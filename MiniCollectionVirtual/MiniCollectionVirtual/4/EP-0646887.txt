<ABSTRACT>
A family of form types having a common set of data types, can 
be transformed into a meta-form which contains all of the data 

types which are arranged into a single layout. The location of 
the fields on the meta-form are specified by a meta-form 

definition data set. The single meta-form definition data set 
is substituted in a character recognition processor, for the 

plurality of form definition data sets which specify the 
layouts of the original form types in the family. This speeds 

the character recognition operation by not requiring a time 
consuming search for customized form definitions. Furthermore, 

by transforming the layout of field images for each form type 
in a family, into a single layout in the meta-form, the fields 

of the meta-form can be quickly located to speed the 
decompression of meaningful parts of the compressed document 

form image, without requiring the time consuming decompression 
of other parts which are not of interest.

The invention disclosed broadly relates to data processing and
more parti cularly relates to character recognition of document
forms.This patent application is related to the European
patent application EP-A-0 565 911 claiming the priority of April 15,
1992 and being entitled "Data Processing System and Method for
Sequentially Repairing Character Recognition Errors for Scanned
Images of Document Forms," by T. S. Betts, et al., the
application being assigned to the IBM Corporation.This patent application is also related to the European
patent application EP-A-0 565 912 claiming the priority of April 17,
1992 and being entitled "Data Processing System and Method for Selecting
Customized Character Recognition Processes and Coded Data
Repair Processes for Scanned Images of Document Forms," by T.
S. Betts, et al., the application being assigned to the IBM
Corporation.This patent application is also related to U. S. patent
5,140,650, entitled "A Computer
Implemented Method for Automatic Extraction of Data From
Printed Forms," by R. G. Casey, et al., the patent being
assigned to the IBM Corporation. This patent application is also related to the European
patent application EP-A-0 622 751 claiming the priority date of April 26,
1993, entitled "System and Method for Enhanced Character
Recognition Accuracy by Adaptive Probability Weighting," by M.
P. T. Bradley, the application being assigned to
the IBM Corporation.This patent application is also related to the European
patent application (EP-A-0 637 811) by D. W. Billings, et al. entitled "Method
for Defining a Plurality of Form Definition Data Sets," claiming the
priority date of August 2, 1993, the application being
assigned to the IBM Corporation.Data contained in digitized images can be extracted for a
number of purpo ses, and in many different ways. A
prerequisite for extracting information from a form is a
knowledge of the types and locations of the data (information
about the "fields" of the form). Currently, most forms
processing applications have their own method for "defining"
forms, and each method is incompatible with the others. In
large image systems which use several different forms
processing applications, each form needs to be separately
defined for each application, which costs time and introduces
inconsistencies in the form definitions. The method disclosed
in the D. W. Billings, et al. patent application
creates form definition data sets which can be used for almost
any forms processing application.In many business applications, there are two
