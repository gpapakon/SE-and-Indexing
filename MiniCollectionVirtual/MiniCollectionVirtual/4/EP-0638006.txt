<DESCRIPTION>
Title: Method of castingDescription of InventionThis invention relates to a method of casting a thermosetting material and more particularly, but not exclusively, to a method of casting metal.In a conventional metal casting method, molten metal is introduced into a casting cavity of a mould via one of more feedways, the feedway and any ancillary reservoir, called a header, providing a reservoir of molten metal to make up for shrinkage of the metal in the casting cavity as the metal in the casting cavity initially cools and at least partially solidifies.To ensure that the metal in the feedway or any header does not cool too quickly such that it solidifies before the casting cavity has filled, or at least before the metal in the casting cavity has initially cooled and at least partially solidified, it is common practice for the feedway and/or header to have a volume of a significant size in relation to the volume of the casting cavity. For example, the total of the feedway and any header may be substantially the same as the volume of the casting cavity.By careful mould design and perhaps using chills to hasten the cooling of the metal in the casting cavity in certain areas, and other techniques, the rate of cooling of the molten metal in the feedway and any header can be controlled to an extent. Exothermic inserts are used in some applications to maintain the temperature of the metal in the mould outside of the casting cavity, but these are expensive and can only provide local heating to areas of the mould.With all such known techniques of casting metal, heat is wasted in melting metal prior to introduction into the mould, which metal then solidifies in the feedway/header and is subsequently scrapped. Also removal of the feedway/header from the eventual casting, can involve expensive machining processes particularly where the volume of the feedway/header is large. 

 According to the invention I provide a method of casting an article in thermosetting material utilising a mould having a casting cavity corresponding to the configuration of the item to be cast, and a reservoir cavity communicating with the casting cavity, the method comprising introducing molten thermosetting material into the casting cavity and into the reservoir cavity, permitting the cast material in the casting cavity initially to cool and at least partially solidify whilst applying heat from an extrinsic source to the material in the reservoir cavity.Thus the size of the feedway and any header can be reduced to a minimum because a large

CLAIMS
1. A method of casting an article in a thermosetting material utilising a mould having a casting cavity corresponding to the configuration of the article to be cast, and a reservoir cavity communicating with the casting cavity, the method comprising introducing molten thermosetting material into the casting cavity and the reservoir, permitting cast material in the casting cavity initially to cool and at least partially solidify whilst applying heat from an extrinsic source to the material in the reservoir cavity.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein the reservoir cavity comprises one of a header and a feedway for the introduction of the molten material from the exterior of the mould, from which reservoir cavity molten material is drawn during initial cooling and at least partial solidification of the cast material in the casting cavity, to make up for shrinkage.
3. A method according to claim 2 wherein the reservoir cavity communicates with the casting cavity at an ingate which opens from the casting cavity to the reservoir cavity generally vertically such that the casting material flows from the reservoir cavity into the casting cavity generally upwardly or downwardly.
4. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the thermosetting material is metal.
5. A method according to claim 4 wherein heat is applied to the metal in the reservoir cavity by passing an electrical current through the metal in the reservoir cavity of a magnitude sufficient to cause heating due to the resistance of the metal in the reservoir cavity. 


6. A method according to claim 5 which includes locating in the mould a first electrode which, when the molten metal is cast, is in electrical contact with the metal in the reservoir cavity, and locating in the mould a second electrode which when the molten metal is cast, is in electrical contact with the cast metal at a position spaced from the first electrode, so as to provide a path for electric current from the first, electrode to the second electrode via the metal in the reservoir cavity.
7. A method according to claim 6 wherein the mould has two reservoir cavities, one being a header which communicates directly with the casting cavity, and the other comprising a feedway which also communicates directly with the casting cavity, and to the exterior of the mould, and into which molten metal is introduced, the method including locating the first electrode such that when the molten metal is cast the first electrode is in electrical contact with the metal in the feedway and locating the second electrode so that when the metal is cast, the second electrode is in electrical contact with the metal in the header, such that the current flow path includes the metal in the casting cavity.
8. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein the molten metal is introduced into the casting cavity and the reservoir cavity under gravity.
9. A method according to claim 8 when the mould is made substantially of sand.
10. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the mould is made substantially of an insulating material.
11. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the amount of heating effect of the heating means is reduced as the material in the casting cavity initially cools and at least partially solidifies. 


12. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 11 wherein the heating effect of the heating means is removed altogether once the cast material in the casting cavity has at least partially solidified.
