<ABSTRACT>
Inhibitors of heparin-binding protein are screened for by incubating HBP or a cell producing HBP with a substance suspected of being an HBP inhibitor and with tissue, cells or a component thereof capable of interacting with HBP, and detecting any effect of said substance on the interaction of HBP with said tissue, cells or component thereof, decreased interaction indicating that said substance is an HBP inhibitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD OF SCREENING FOR INHIBITORS OF HEPARIN-BINDING PROTEINFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to methods of screening for substances which are inhibitors or antagonists of heparin- binding protein, as well as to a test kit for use in the method.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe covalent structure of two closely related proteins isolated from peripheral neutrophil leukocytes of human and porcine origin have recently been determined (cf. H. Flodgaard et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 197. 1991, pp. 535-547; J. Pohl et al., FEBS Lett. 272, 1990, p. 200 ff.) . Both proteins show a high simila¬ rity to neutrophil elastase, but owing to selective mutations of the active serine 195 and histidine 57 (chy otrypsin number¬ ing (B.S. Hartley, "Homologies in Serine Proteinases", Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. Series 257, 1970, p. 77 ff. ) ) the proteins lack protease activity. The proteins have been named human heparin-binding protein (hHBP) and porcine heparin-binding protein (pHBP) , respectively, owing to their high affinity for heparin; Schafer et al. ( .M. Schafer et al., Infect. Immun. 5_3_, 1986, p. 651 ff.) have named the protein cationic antimicrobial protein (CAP37) due to its antimicrobial activity. The protein has also been shown to be chemotactic for monocytes over the range 1.3 x 10'9 M - 10"8 M (H.A. Pereira et al., J. Clin.Invest. 85, 1990, p.1468 ff.), consistent with the results apparent from Flodgaard et al., op. cit..Furthermore, HBP has been shown to mediate detachment and contraction of endothelial cells and fibroblasts when added to such cells grown in monolayer culture. HBP also stimulates monocyte survival and thrombospondin secretion (E. østergaard and H. Flodgaard, J. Leukocyte Biol. 51, 1992, p 316 ff. 

 From the azurophil granules, a protein with the first 20 N-terminal a ino acid residues identical to those of hHBP and CAP37 called azurocidin has also been isolated (J.E. Gabay et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 1989, p. 5610 ff. ; C.G. Wilde et al., J. Biol. Che . 265. 1990, p. 2038 ff.) and its antimicrobial properties have been reported (D. Campanelli et al., J. Clin. Invest. 85, 1990, p. 904 ff.).The presence of hHBP in the neutrophil leucocytes and the fact that 89% of CAP37 (which is identical to hHBP) is released when the leucocytes are phagocytosing Staph. aureus (H.A. Pereira et al. , op. cit. ) indicate that a function of hHBP could be its involvement in the inflammatory process since the protein is apparently released from activated neutrophils.
