Linear drive with a housing (1), having a longitudinal slot 
(13), with a driving section (3) mounted so as to be 

longitudinally moveable in the housing (1), with a longitudinal 
guide (16) mounted outside the housing (1), on which is mounted 

a guide section (18) moveable in the longitudinal direction (4), 
to which a load to be moved may be attached, with a driver (14) 

connecting the driving section (3) with the guide section (18) 
to form a movement unit (29), and extending through the 

longitudinal slot (13), and with a buffer unit (30) working in 
conjunction with the guide section (18) and effective in the 

direction of movement (24) of the movement unit (29), 
characterized in that the buffer unit (30) is interposed in the 

connection between the driving section (3) and the guide section 
(18) immediately adjacent to the driver (14). 
Linear drive according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
buffer unit (30) is mounted outside the housing (1). 
Linear drive according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the buffer unit (30) is mounted in the area between the guide 

section (18) and the driver (14). 
Linear drive according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the buffer unit (30) contains or is formed by an elastic 

device (39). 
Linear drive according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
elastic device (39) contains a spring assembly (40), for example 

a cup spring assembly. 
Linear drive according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the buffer unit (30) contains or is formed by a shock 

absorber unit (44).  
 
Linear drive according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the buffer unit (30) combines in itself the functions of 

an elastic device (39) and a shock absorber unit (44). 
Linear drive according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the buffer unit (30) contains two buffer units (31, 31', 

45), each responsible for buffering in one of the two possible 
directions of movement of the movement unit (29). 
Linear drive according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the intensity of buffering is adjustable. 
Linear drive according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
by a buffering characteristic in which the main buffering effect 

of the buffer unit (30) only takes place at a certain limit 
loading. 
Linear drive according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the movement unit (29), apart from the 

purely axial resilience ensured by the buffer unit (30), is 
designed as an intrinsically rigid assembly. 
Linear drive according to claim 11, characterized in that the 
movement unit (29) is equipped with means of adjustment (31, 31', 

57, 58) which, during assembly, facilitate adjustment of the 
guide section (18) guided on the longitudinal guide (16) relative 

to the driving section (3) guided in the housing, with the 
adjusted relative position between guide section (18) and driving 

section (3) remaining unchanged in operation.  
 
Linear drive according to any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the housing (1) has an external essentially 

square or rectangular cross-section, wherein the longitudinal 
slot (13) and the longitudinal guide (16) are provided on 

adjacent sides (65, 66) of the housing in the circumferential 
direction, and wherein the section of the movement unit (29) 

lying outside the housing (1) has an essentially L-shaped cross-section. 
Linear drive according to claim 13, characterized in that 
the buffer unit (30) is located in the transition zone (67) 

between the two legs of the L. 
Linear drive according to any of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that the longitudinal guide (16) is formed by 

a guide rail (17) mounted externally on the housing (1), and 
engaged by the guide section (18) on opposite sides. 
Linear drive according to any of claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that the housing (1) is a cylinder housing in 

which is formed a pressure-medium-tight housing space (2) which 
accommodates the driving section (3) in the form of a pressure-medium-actuated 

driveable piston (5), wherein the longitudinal 
slot (13) is sealed by means of a sealing band (15).
