<ABSTRACT>
A ware transfer mechanism is disclosed which 
includes equally spaced pockets (49) which have a fixed 

rear wall (48) and a side wall (50) advanceable from a 
retracted position to an advanced position as the 

pockets (49) are displaced along an arcuate path across 
the transfer plate (16) overlapping a first conveyor (10) and 

transverse cross conveyor (14). Containers (12) will be 
displaced by the side wall (50) to locate the container in 

line with the containers (12) on the cross conveyor (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
manufacture of glass bottles (ware) on I.S. 
(Individual Section) or H-28 machines where bottles 
are deposited, at a predetermined spacing, on one 
conveyor and transferred to a second conveyor which 
is to carry the bottles to processing stations. This 
invention more particularly relates to a ware 
transfer mechanism which will transfer the bottles 
from the first conveyor to the second conveyor. State of the art ware transfer mechanisms are 
shown in U.S. Patents numbered 4,776,448 and 
3,701,407. With such ware transfer mechanisms, over 
400 soda bottles can be transferred per minute but, 
if this mechanism is to keep pace with productivity 
gains, it must be able to transfer 600 soda bottles 
per minute. It is accordingly an object of the present 
invention to provide a ware transfer mechanism that 
will be able to transfer glass containers at a higher 
rate. The invention generally comprises a ware 
transfer mechanism for transferring in line glass 
containers having an approximately uniform spacing on 
a first conveyor, across a transfer plate, onto an 
approximately transversely related cross conveyor 
with the glass containers in line and having an 
approximately uniform spacing characterized by 
a horizontally extending endless ware transfer 
conveyor including a plurality of container receiving 
pockets having a selected spacing, each of said 
pockets including an outwardly projecting wall having 
an outer free end and a perpendicularly related side 
wall displaceable from a retracted position defining 
with the outwardly projecting side wall a full 
container receiving pocket to a fully advanced  
 
position whereat said side wall projects beyond the 
outer free end of said outwardly projecting wall, means for supporting said ware transfer 
conveyor so that the path of said free end of said 
pocket outwardly projecting wall will intersect the 
center line of the containers on the first conveyor, 
follow an arcuate path across the transfer plate 
intersecting the center line of the containers on the 
cross conveyor and be spaced from the containers on 
the cross conveyor, and means for displacing said side wall from said 
retracted position to said fully advanced position as 
the free end of said outwardly projecting pocket wall 
follows said arcuate path across the transfer plate 
to locate the containers on the center line of the 
containers on the cross conveyor. Other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the

A ware transfer mechanism (20) for transferring in 
line glass containers (12) having an approximately uniform 

spacing on a first conveyor (10), across a transfer plate (16), 
onto an approximately transversely related cross 

conveyor (14) with the glass containers in line and having 
an approximately uniform spacing characterized by 


a horizontally extending endless ware transfer 
conveyor (21) including a plurality of container 

receiving pockets (49) having a selected spacing, 
each of said pockets including an outwardly 

projecting wall (48) having an outer free end and a 
perpendicularly related side wall (50) displaceable 

from a retracted position defining with the outwardly 
projecting side wall a full container receiving 

pocket to a fully advanced position whereat said side 
wall projects beyond the outer free end of said 

outwardly projecting wall, 
means for supporting said ware transfer 
conveyor so that the path of said free end of said 

pocket outwardly projecting wall will intersect the 
center line of the containers on the first conveyor, 

follow an arcuate path across the transfer plate 
intersecting the center line of the containers on the 

cross conveyor and be spaced from the containers on 
the cross conveyor, and 
means (34) for displacing said side wall from 
said retracted position to said fully advanced 

position as the free end of said outwardly projecting 
pocket wall follows said arcuate path across the 

transfer plate to locate the containers on the center 
line of the containers on the cross conveyor. 
A ware transfer mechanism according to claim 1, 
wherein each of said pockets is defined by an 

outwardly projecting wall and the next forward  
 

outwardly projecting wall. 
A ware transfer mechanism according to claim 1, 
wherein each of said pockets is defined by an 

outwardly projecting wall and the next rearward outwardly 
projecting wall. 
A ware transfer mechanism according to claims 1 or 2, 
wherein said cross conveyor is displaced at 

a speed which is slower than the first conveyor and 
wherein each of said pockets is defined by an 

outwardly projecting wall and the next forward outwardly 
projecting wall. 
A ware transfer mechanism according to claims 1 or 3, 
wherein said cross conveyor is displaced at 

a speed which is faster than the first conveyor and 
wherein each of said pockets is defined by an 

outwardly projecting wall and the next rearward outwardly 
projecting wall.
