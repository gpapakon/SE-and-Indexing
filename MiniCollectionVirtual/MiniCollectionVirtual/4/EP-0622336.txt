<ABSTRACT>
An improved method is proposed for the preparation of a 
powder of a rare earth oxide having good dispersibility containing 

no agglomerates of particles even without undertaking disintegration 
indispensable heretofore. The improved method comprises 

precipitation of a rare earth carbonate by the admixture of an aqueous 
solution of an inorganic rare earth salt with an aqueous solution 

of ammonium hydrogen carbonate in an excess amount over 
the stoichiometrically equivalent amount to give a slurry of the 

rare earth carbonate which is subjected to heating treatment in 
two steps each under specified conditions to effect aging of the carbonate 

precipitates. Characteristically, the aqueous slurry after 
the first aging treatment is subjected to an adjustment in three differently 

specified ways prior to the second aging treatment including, 
first, admixture of an additional amount of ammonium hydrogen 

carbonate, second, addition of water to decrease the solid content 
in the slurry and, third, addition of an inorganic acid to decrease 

the pH of the slurry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation 
of a powder of a rare earth oxide or, more particularly, to a method 
for the preparation of a powder of an oxide of a rare earth element 
consisting of particles having excellent dispersibility without agglomeration 
to be useful as a base material of a sintered ceramic 
body of a rare earth oxide or as a sintering aid of various kinds of 
ceramic materials such as silicon nitride, aluminum nitride and 
the like. In the prior art, an oxide powder of a rare earth element is 
conventionally prepared by the process in which an aqueous solution 
of an inorganic salt of the rare earth element is admixed with 
a water-soluble precipitant such as carbonates, oxalic acid or oxalates, 
hydroxides and the like to give a water-insoluble compound 
of the rare earth element such as a carbonate, oxalate, hydroxide 
and the like, respectively, and the precipitates of the water-insoluble 
rare earth compound are collected by filtration, washed with 
water, dehydrated and dried and finally calcined so as to thermally 
decompose the rare earth compound into an oxide powder. It is 
unavoidable in this prior art method that the particles of the rare 
earth oxide cause agglomeration to form lumps or granules sometimes 
having a dimension of several millimeters. Therefore, disintegration  
 
of such agglomerates of the rare earth oxide particles is 
indispensable when the oxide powder is to be used in the above 
mentioned applications. A problem in conducting disintegration is 
that, even by undertaking the disintegration in a wet process by 
the addition of a wetting liquid and a dispersion work aid, fully 
dispersible rare earth oxide particles can hardly be obtained with a 
substantial amount of coarse particles or agglomerates even after 
a prolonged disintegration work which must be removed by screening 
so that the cost for the preparation of a rare earth oxide powder 
is necessarily increased. The present invention accordingly has an object to provide an 
improved method for the preparation of a powder of a rare earth 
oxide having good dispersibility of the particles without agglomeration 
even when the disintegration procedure is omitted. In a first aspect of the invention, the method of the present 
invention for the preparation of a powder of a rare earth oxide comprises 
the successive steps of: 
(a1) admixing an aqueous solution of an inorganic salt of the rare 
earth element with an aqueous solution of a water-soluble alkaline
