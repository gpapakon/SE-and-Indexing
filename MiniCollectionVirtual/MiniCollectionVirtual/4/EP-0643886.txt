<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates generally to an apparatus and a method for receiving and processing information, and for adapting the operational characteristics of the processing in response to material included in the received information. More particularly, the invention relates to an apparatus and a method embodying a software-controlled process which adapts or modifies the software in response to the received information. Although the invention has many applications, the invention is more particularly described in connection with a motion picture application in which film stock carries a conventional analog SVA soundtrack and a digital soundtrack with a digital representation of the software required to properly process the digital soundtrack. An apparatus and a method according to one embodiment establishes what version of software is required to properly process the digital soundtrack, optionally modifies its sofware from information carried with the digital soundtrack if the current version on hand is not appropriate, and uses the updated version of software to process the digital soundtrack on the remainder of the current film and other future films until such time as another software update is required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to an apparatus and a method for receiving and 
processing information, and for adapting the operational characteristics of the processing in 
response to material included in the received information. More particularly, the invention 
relates to an apparatus and a method embodying a software-controlled process which adapts 
or modifies the software in response to the received information. Although the invention 
has many applications, the invention is more particularly described in connection with a 
motion picture application in which film stock carries a conventional analog SVA (Stereo Variable Area) 
soundtrack and a digital soundtrack with a digital representation of the software required to 
properly process the digital soundtrack. An apparatus and a method according to one 
embodiment establishes what version of software is required to properly process the digital 
soundtrack, optionally modifies its software from information carried with the digital 
soundtrack if the current version on hand is not appropriate, and uses the updated version 
of software to process the digital soundtrack on the remainder of the current film and other 
future films until such time as another software update is required. As software-controlled devices become increasingly important in many diverse fields 
of application, the difficulties associated with modifying the software that controls these 
devices is becoming increasingly troublesome. The need to modify software arises from a 
variety of situations such as: (1) the software does not operate correctly due to some 
deficiency in design or implementation, often referred to as a "bug"; (2) the needs of the 
application in which the software operates have changed, therefore the software must be 
modified, enhanced, or replaced in order to service the changed needs; or (3) new software 
is available which provides new features or which services an application more efficiently. Modifications to software are placed into effect by a procedure referred to herein as 
an "installation." A particular embodiment of software is referred to herein as a "version" 
of the software. Thus, modifying or replacing a particular embodiment of software with a 
different embodiment is referred to as installing a different version of the software.  
 A later version of software which comprises corrections to bugs or a version which 
includes additional features is referred to herein as an "upgrade" and the installation of 
such a version is referred to as

software in response to operation material software, whereby signals representing sounds 
and/or visual images are provided by the apparatus substantially without interruption. 
Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said adaptor means (308) includes 
control means (334) for establishing in response to said operation material the version or 

versions of said software required to play back the presentation material represented in the 
first form, wherein said adaptor means alters and/or replaces only the installed software 

which is not the required version.  
 
Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said operation material comprises at 
least a portion of the software to play back the presentation material represented in the 

first form using one or more than one playback system implementation, wherein said 
adaptor means (308) includes control means (334) for establishing, in response to said 

operation material, the version or versions for the software required to play back the presentation 
material represented in the first form on the playback system implementation 

associated with the apparatus. 
Apparatus according to either one of claims 4 or 5 wherein said operation 
material also comprises directory information providing an inventory of the operation 

material software, whereby said control means (334) establishes the resident software to 
be altered and/or replaced by comparing the directory information to the resident software.
