<ABSTRACT>
Stilbene derivatives of the following general formula (1) or their 
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are low in toxicity, but are 

water soluble and effective as carcinostatics: 

wherein R¹, R² and R³ each represent an alkyl group having 1 to 
3 carbon atoms; X represents a hydrogen atom or a nitrile group; and 

Y represents an alkyloxy group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, an alkyl 
group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a halogen atom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cis-stilbene
derivatives, to their use as pharmaceuticals and, in
particular, to carcinostatics containing them as active
ingredients.Combretastatins having cis-stilbene as their basic
skeleton are known to have strong cytotoxicity. However,
because they are barely 
soluble in water, they have not been put to practical use as
medicines. Therefore, various investigations to develop their
derivatives have been made (Molecular Pharmacology 34, 200-206
(1988); J. Med. Chem., 34, 2579-2588(1991); WO 92/16486; J. Med.
Chem., 35, 2293-2306(1992); WO 93/23357; J. Med. Chem., 36, 2817-2821(1993);
Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 4, 699-704(1994)), but
compounds,which are effective in vivo are still unknown.The present inventors sought to identify combretastatin derivatives which
may be synthesized easily, which are of low toxicity and which have
a high pharmaceutical effect, and to provide carcinostatics
containing them.The present inventors synthesized various stilbene
derivatives and screened carcinostatic compounds from
them and, as a result, found that compounds of the following
general formula (1) have a remarkable carcinostatic effect in vivo.These compounds, which have an amino group at the
3-position of the benzene ring of cis-stilbene, are novel combretastatin
derivatives
 
wherein X represents a hydrogen atom or a nitrile group.Examples of compounds of the invention
include, for example, the following:
(Z)-1-(3-amino-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)ethene,
(E)-3-(3-amino-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-prop-2-en-nitrile,Compounds of formula (1) of the present invention may be
produced, for example, according to the reaction route mentioned
below. 
In these formulae, R1, R2, R3 are all methyl groups and Y
is a methoxy group.

In these formulae, R1, R2, R3 and Y have the same meanings as those
mentioned above.Precisely, compounds of formula (5) which belong to the
compounds of the present invention may be obtained, for example,
by reacting a triphenylphosphine bromide derivative of formula (2)
and an aldehyde of formula (3) at room temperature in alcohol or 
benzene, in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride
or sodium ethoxide for 2 to 4 hours followed by subjecting the
reaction product to chromatography to obtain the
intended cis-compound. The cis-compound may be reduced with
zinc-acetic acid or the like to obtain a compound of formula
(5).Compounds of formula (10) which belong to the compounds of the
present invention may be produced, for example,
