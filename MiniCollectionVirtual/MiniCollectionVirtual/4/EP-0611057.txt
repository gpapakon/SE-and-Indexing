<ABSTRACT>
A received and demodulated multi-level signal (32) is 
corrected for D.C. offset by means of a feedback loop (34) 

which applies a correction signal (38) to the multi-level 
signal (32). Initial coarse correction is provided by 

feeding the corrected signal (42) into the feedback loop 
where a low pass filter (36) averages the corrected signal 

over time and detects departure from zero of this time-averaged 
signal. After initial coarse correction, finer 

correction of D.C. offset is provided in a data-aided mode 
in which detected data values (46) are fed into the 

feedback loop (34). The method achieves D.C. offset 
correction without the need to know anything about the 

data pattern of the received signal (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for 
correcting D.C. offset in a multi-level digital signal 
which has been received and demodulated in a radio. The 
invention is particularly, but not exculsively, applicable 
to the correction of D.C. offset in the multi-level 
digital signal emanating from a frequency discriminator, 
prior to signal detection. For digital frequency modulated (or phase modulated) 
systems employing frequency discriminator receivers, the 
output circuit of the discriminator needs to be D.C. 
coupled since the demodulated baseband signal contains a 
D.C. component. Any frequency error in the frequency 
modulated carrier before a frequency discriminator 
receiver appears as an additional D.C. offset in the 
discriminator output signal, so that all the received data 
symbols are offset from their nominal voltage levels by a 
fixed amount that is directly proportional to the 
frequency error. This offset, if not compensated 
correctly before going through the threshold level 
detection, causes an increase in detection error and hence 
performance degradation. In the worst case, the D.C. 
offset is so large that the received data symbols fall  
 
into incorrect detection bands, leading to erroneous 
detection even in the absence of noise. Although the 
receiver normally employs automatic frequency control 
(AFC) to track the carrier frequency, it often adapts too 
slowly and even a residual frequency error of several 
hundred Hertz may be sufficient to cause noticeable 
increase in detection error. Furthermore, the practical 
analogue frequency discriminator circuit itself may often 
contain some imbalance, causing further D.C. offset in its 
output signal. This offset varies from component to 
component and drifts with temperature. To reduce or 
compensate it using conventional analogue methods 
increases circuit complexity and receiver costs. US Patent 4873702 (Chiu) discloses a method of correcting 
D.C. offset in multilevel digitally modulated signals. 
The data transmission system of Chiu is arranged to send a 
particular preamble signal each time a different data 
source begins transmission of its data. The present 
invention aims to provide a method of and apparatus for 
correction of D.C. offset not requiring the transmission 
of any particular preamble signal. According to one aspect the invention provides a method of 
correcting D.C. offset in a multi-level digital signal 
which has been received and demodulated, comprising 
employing a feedback loop to generate
