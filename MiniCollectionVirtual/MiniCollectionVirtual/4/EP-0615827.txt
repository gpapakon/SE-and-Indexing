<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to methods for producing a box comprising a container, a lid and a hinge, these being produced from a single part made of a mouldable material, and two labels. The method is essentially characterised by the fact that it consists, by means of two half-moulds (21, 22) comprising two mould cavities (23, 24) for the container, hinge and lid, in bringing up and holding a label (6) in front of the inlet of the mould cavity (26) and facing the mould cavity (27), in holding the other label (7) against the mould cavity (31), in moving the half-moulds (21, 22) into contact, in injecting mouldable material (45) between these two half-moulds (21, 22) via at least two injection nozzles (41, 42) lying respectively at the top (47) of the mould cavity (27) and on the mould cavity (31) of the lid, facing the labels, in allowing the material to solidify and then in demoulding the part with its two labels.
