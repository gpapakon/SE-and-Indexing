<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine includes a valve 
operating device operatively connected to a pair of 

intake valves (V
I1
,V
I2
) 
and capable of opening and closing one of 

the intake valves (V
I1
) in accordance with the operating 
condition of the engine and opening and closing the 

other intake valve (V
I2
) in a small lift amount, thereby 
produ
cing a deflection of the intake air drawn into the 
combustion chamber (5), and a fuel injection valve (55) for 

injecting a fuel toward the pair of intake valve bores 
that are independently opened and closed by the intake 

valves (V
I1
,V
I2
) 
respectively. The timing of the opening and 

closing of the intake valve (V
I2
) that is opened and closed 
only in the small lift amount is set at a time point 

such that the lift amount is maximized in the first half 
of the intake stroke of the piston. This promotes the 

atomization of the fuel which is being drawn in with the 
intake air by the opening of the intake valve (V
I2
) opened and 
closed in the small lift amount, and to enhance the 

combustibility in the combustion chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal
combustion engine having a valve operating device
operatively connected to a pair of intake valves and
capable of opening and closing one of the intake valves
in accordance with an operating condition of the engine
while only opening and closing the other intake valve in
a small lift amount
according to the preamble parts of
the independent claims 1, 5 and 8.Such internal combustion engines have been already
known, for example, from Japanese Patent Application
Laid-open No. 94407/92, corresponding to EP-A-0 470 869.In the above prior art internal combustion engine,
the timing of opening and closing of the intake valve
opened and closed in the small lift amount is set in a
second half of an intake stroke, thereby eliminating an
adverse influence on the production of a swirl due to
the opening of the other intake valve. However, it has
been ascertained by an experiment by the present
inventors that the flow speed of the intake air drawn 
into the combustion chamber at the time of the opening
of the intake valve is higher in a first half of the
intake stroke and lower in the second half. For
atomizing the fuel when the intake valves are opened in
a small lift amount, it is disadvantageous that the
opening and closing timing is set in the second half of
the intake stroke, as in the above-described prior art.From EP-A-0 607 992, which is a prior-art document according to
Art. 54(3) EPC, there is known an internal combustion engine in
which the lift amount of two intake valves associated with one
combustion chamber is set such that the lift amount of one of the
valves is set to a smaller decree than the lifz amount of the
other one of the valves. Further, the valve having the smaller
lift amount is opened such that its maximum lifz amount appears
at a point in time which is within the first half at the opening
period of the valve having the larger lift amount. This document
does not disclose an which point in time the injection of the fuel
is carried out.Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to provide an internal combustion engine,
wherein the atomization of the fuel being drawn at the
time of opening of the intake valve that is opened and
closed only in the small lift amount is promoted to
enhance the combustibility in the combustion chamber. It is another object of the present invention to
provide a stability of control of the air-fuel ratio and
increase the power output from the engine by supplying a
sufficient amount of a fuel toward the intake
