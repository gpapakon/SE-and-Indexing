<ABSTRACT>
A cart for barbecue grills. The cart has a shelf, a table, two first 
legs and two second legs. The shelf has two parallel beams (70) for 

carrying a barbecue grill. The beams (70) each have a first end, a 
second end and a curved slot (75) formed therein near the second end 

thereof. A pivot (11) joins together the first ends of the beams (70). A 
bar (90) joins together the second ends of the beams (70). The table has 

two supports pivotally attached to the beams (70) and a number of slats 
(751) transversely attached on the supports. The first legs (10) each 

have a first end, a second end and a linking point sited between the 
first and second ends thereof. The first ends of the first legs (10) are 

pivotally attached to the first ends of the supports by the pivot (11). 
The second ends of the first legs are joined together by a handle (50). 

The second legs (15) each have a first end, a second end and a linking 
point sited between the first and second ends thereof. The first legs 

(10) are pivotally linked to the second legs (15) at the linking points 
thereof. The first ends of the second legs (15) are joined together by a 

rod (60) receivable in the curved slots (75) so that the cart is in an 
extended position. The second ends of the second legs (15) carry two 

wheels (30) for rolling when the cart is in a folded position. A hook 
(61) is attached on the rod (90) for hooking a grip formed on a gas 

tank. A slat (12) is attached on the first legs (10) and has two cutouts 
(13) for receiving a cylindrical stand formed below a gas tank.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foldable cart for 
barbecue grills. There have been various trolleys or carts for barbecue 
grills. The trolleys have wheels for rolling inside patios, 
but cannot be easily carried outdoors. The carts cannot be 
folded and, hence, cannot be easily stored. The trolleys or 
carts are assembled by means of threaded nut-and-bolt sets. 
Generally, the trolleys or carts are folded before the 
storage or transportation thereof. To fold the trolleys or 
carts, some of the threaded nut-and-bolt sets are disengaged 
by means of tools. The trolleys or carts are extended 
before the use thereof. In this case, tools are necessary 
again. It is troublesome to fold and extend the trolleys or 
carts. It is also inconvenient to carry the necessary 
tools. Therefore, the present invention is intended to 
solve the above-mentioned problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
cart for barbecue grills. The cart has a shelf, a table, 
two first legs and two second legs. The shelf has two 
parallel beams for carrying a barbecue grill. The beams 
each have a first end, a second end and a curved slot formed 
therein near the second end thereof. A pivot joins together 
the first ends of the supports. A bar joins together the 
second ends of the supports. The table has two supports 
pivotally attached to the beams and a number of slats transversely 
attached on the supports. The first legs each have 
a first end, a second end and a linking point sited between  
 
the first and second ends thereof. The first ends of the 
first legs are pivotally attached to the first ends of the 
supports by the pivot. The second ends of the first legs 
are joined together by a handle. The second legs each have 
a first end, a second end and a linking point sited between 
the first and second ends thereof. The first legs are 
pivotally linked to the second legs at the linking points 
thereof. The first ends of the second legs are joined 
together by a rod receivable in the curved slots so that the 
cart is in an extended position. The second ends of the 
second legs carry two wheels for rolling when the cart is in 
a folded position. A hook is attached on the rod for hooking 
a grip formed on a gas tank. A slat is attached on the 
first legs and has two cutouts for receiving a cylindrical 
stand formed below the gas tank. For a better understanding of the present invention and 
objects thereof, a study of the detailed description of the 
embodiments described hereinafter should be made in
