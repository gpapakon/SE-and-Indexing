<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for holding perforating tools with respect to a sheet-guiding cylinder of a rotary printing machine, a carrier body being supported axially displaceably on a shaft penetrating an axially parallel carrier body bore. The carrier body is provided with clamping means for its clamping with respect to the shaft and with actuating means. By means of the latter, the mutual clamping of shaft and carrier body can be produced or released. As actuating means, rotatably supported rings are provided, a shaft (1) which penetrates a carrier body (6), which holds an eccentric ring (13) with perforating tool (19, 20), functioning as its supporting and switching shaft.

Web-fed printing machine with a device for 
receiving perforating tools opposite a sheet-guiding 

cylinder (22) having a carrying body (6) which includes 
a carrying-body bore passed through by a shaft (1) which 

runs parallel to said bore and on which the carrying body 
(6) is mounted in an axially displaceable manner, the 

carrying body (6) being provided with clamping means (5) 
for securing it with respect to the shaft (1) and a 

rotatably mounted eccentric ring (13) being provided as 
actuating means, characterized in that the shaft (1) 

which passes through the carrying body (6) serves as the 
mounting shaft of said carrying body and as the actuating 

shaft (1) for a perforating tool (19, 20) which is 
received on the eccentric ring (13), which can be 

adjusted relative to the carrying body (6) using adjustment 
means (11, 12, 16). 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that a rolling contact bearing (19) 

which receives a perforating rim (20) is mounted on the 
eccentric ring (13). 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the outer ring of a rolling contact 

bearing (19) received on the eccentric ring (13) is 
designed as a perforating tool. 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the inner ring of the rolling 

contact bearing (19) is designed as an eccentric ring 
(13). 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that a first stop (15) and a second stop  

 
(16) are formed on the eccentric ring (13). 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that, with respect to the mounting and 

actuating shaft (1), the eccentric ring (13) exhibits 
eccentricity (14). 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the carrying body (6) comprises a 

stop (7). 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the carrying body (6) receives a 

clamping screw (5) by means of which it can be fixed in 
its position on the mounting and actuating shaft (1). 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claims 5 
and 7, characterized in that a compression spring (10) is 

received between the first stop (15) of the eccentric 
ring (13) and the stop (7) of the carrying body (6). 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claims 1 
and 5, characterized in that an adjustment means (11) 

which acts on the second stop (16) of the eccentric ring 
(13) is provided on the carrying body (6) for the radial 

adjustment of the eccentric ring (13) with respect to the 
carrying body (6). 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that a protrusion (18) engaging into a 

continuous axial groove (2) of the mounting and actuating 
shaft (1) is configured on the carrying body (6). 
Web-fed printing machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the disengagement of individual 

perforating tools (20) located on the mounting and 
actuating shaft (1) takes place simply by rotating the 

carrying body (6), in the anticlockwise direction, with 
respect to the mounting and actuating shaft (1).
