<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid thermistor temperature sensor having a temperature-resistance characteristic exhibiting a plateau in the form of an electrical and physical combination of resistors (10, 11) having negative and positive temperature coefficients. The electrical coupling of the resistors (11, 12) is carried out via an electrode material (12) which ensures contact-making of the temperature-dependent resistors (10, 11) which breaks down a barrier layer, and forms a diffusion barrier for a mutual diffusion of components of the temperature-dependent resistors (10, 11) contacted by them into the respectively other temperature-dependent resistor.
