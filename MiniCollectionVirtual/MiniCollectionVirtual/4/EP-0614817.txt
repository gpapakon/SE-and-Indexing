<ABSTRACT>
The metal container of the present invention 
includes a rubber protector (10) which is annular
ly 
fitted to at least one of an upper end wall (4) and a 

lower end wall (6) of the container body (1) and extends 
over the outer peripheral region of the end wall. The 

end wall is formed with an annular stepped portion (9) 
by cold working and preferably also a radial protruded 

portion so that work-hardening of stainless steel of 
which the container is preferably made is formed to 

increase the strength of the end walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal container, in particular a 
stainless steel container, 
having a rubber protector, which is used for storing beverage such as 
beer, etc. according to the preamble of claim 1. As a container in which various kinds of beverages including 
beer are filled and which is intended to be used for storing in 
a stationary place or transportation, a stainless steel container has been 
generally used. The upper and lower outer peripheral edges of a container 
body are fitted with ring-shaped protectors, respectively. The 
protectors cover the periphery of an upper end wall and that of a lower 
end wall of the container body to protect end wall faces of the upper end 
wall and the lower end wall. In use, a lower protector provided at the 
lower end wall serves for a stand for stationarily placing the container 
and an upper protector provided at the upper end wall serves for a 
supporting base for a container to be piled above. The protector has been conventionally manufactured by mainly 
using a stainless steel material which is the same one as the container 
body. The stainless steel protectors have been usually welded to an 
upper peripheral edge and a lower peripheral edge of the stainless steel 
container body which has been worked under deep-drawing. Another example 
of the protector is that an upper end wall and a lower end wall are  
 
welded to a lower inner peripheral face and an upper inner peripheral 
face of a stainless steel cylinder so that the upper end wall overhangs 
upwardly and the lower end wall overhangs downwardly to form protector 
portions. In either cases of the above, when a protector is made from a 
stainless steel, it is stout and good-looking. However, when, for example, 
draft beer is filled in a container, the weight of the container becomes 
considerably heavy. Thus, when a container is erroneously dropped at the 
time of loading in or loading-out of containers to be transported or the 
container is struck hard against a floor, not only a noise is given forth, 
but also the container is deformed or damaged. Especially, when the 
container is dropped in an inclined state, the protector is locally 
deformed, so that the container can not be stably placed at a normal 
upstanding posture and it becomes difficult to pile another container 
thereon. In order to solve the above problems, it is considered to use a 
ring-shaped rubber protector as a protector. Japanese Design Registration

<CLAIMS>
A metal container for storing liquid therein, 
comprising: 


a cylindrical container body (1) made of a metal 
plate, and having a cylindrical girth portion (5, 7) and 

upper and lower end walls (4, 6) at longitudinal ends of 
the girth portion; 
a rubber protector (10; 25; 31, 32) fixed onto at least one 
end wall and extending from an 

end of the girth portion to a middle portion of the end wall, 
said rubber protector 

preventing deformation of the end wall; 
characterised in that 
a hardened region is formed in at least one of the 
upper and lower end walls (4, 6) to harden the same, said 

hardened region preventing deformation of the end wall, the 
rubber protector being fixed onto this end wall 

with the hardened portion. 
A metal container as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that said hardened region includes at 

least one annular stepped portion (9) provided in a 
middle portion of the end wall to form an inner portion and an 

outer portion relative to the stepped portion, said 
annular stepped portion having an inclined surface (17), 

said rubber protector (10) being fixed to the inclined 
surface.  

 
A metal container as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that said inner portion is located 

axially outwardly relative to the outer portion along a 
longitudinal axis of the cylindrical girth portion. 
A metal container as claimed in claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that said hardened region includes a 

plurality of annular stepped portions (23) 
concentrically arranged and spaced apart from each other 

to strengthen the end wall. 
A metal container as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that said rubber protector (25) extends 

over the plurality of annular stepped portions (23) and 
terminates at the inclined surface (24) of an innermost 

stepped portion (23b). 
A metal container as claimed in any of claims 2 to 
5, characterized in that said inner portion of the end 

wall includes a plurality of radial ribs (22) extending 
radially outwardly from a center portion thereof. 
A metal container as claimed in any of claims 2 to 
6, characterized by further comprising a reinforcing  

 
plate (26) embedded in the rubber protector, said 

reinforcing plate having a stepped portion with a shape 
corresponding to that of the end wall and placed over 

the stepped portion of the end wall. 
A metal container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that said rubber protector (31, 32) 

includes an opening (33, 34) operating as a handle and a 
draining hole for the container, and an overhanging 

portion (35) extending from the opening to the girth 
portion, said overhanging portion having two inclined 

surfaces converging toward each other so that force 
applied to the rubber protector through the opening is 

transferred to the cylindrical body through the 
overhanging portion. 
A metal container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
8, characterized by further comprising a beam (41) fixed 

to an outer surface of the end wall with the hardened 
portion, said beam being embedded inside the rubber 

protector to strengthen the end wall and the rubber 
protector. 
A metal container as claimed in claim 9, 
characterized in that said beam (41) has an annular 

shape and projects outwardly from the end wall.  
 
A metal container as claimed in claim 10, 
characterized in that said beam has two projections (41, 

42) radially spaced apart from each other. 
A metal container as claimed in claim 10 or 11, 
characterized in that said beam (41) further includes a 

reinforcing member (44) situated radially inwardly of 
the beam to prevent deformation of the beam over the end 

wall. 
A metal container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
12, characterized in that said rubber protector includes 

a shoe (51) mounted on an outer end surface of the 
rubber protector, said shoe having hardness different 

from that of the rubber protector. 
A metal container as claimed in claim 13, 
characterized in that said shoe (51) has a sliding 

property so that the container slides easily. 
A metal container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
14, characterized in that said cylindrical container 

body (1) is made of an austenite stainless steel and is 
formed of first and second bodies (2, 3), each body  

 
having a cylindrical portion (5, 7) with the respective 

end wall (4, 6), said container body being formed by 
connecting the cylindrical portions (5, 7) of the first 

and second bodies (2, 3). 
A metal container as claimed in claim 15, 
characterized in that said rubber protector is fitted 

onto one end of the container body (1), the other end of 
the container body having a stainless steel protector 

integrally formed with one of the first and second 
bodies (2, 3).
