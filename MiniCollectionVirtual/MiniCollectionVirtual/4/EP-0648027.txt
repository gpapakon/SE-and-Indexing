<ABSTRACT>
A satellite-based cellular telecommunications system 
employing a constellation of telecommunications satellites in 

medium earth orbit to provide multibeam radio frequency (rf) 
communications links for worldwide cellular telephone service 

with a minimum number of satellites. The telecommunications 
satellites are placed in a plurality of inclined orbits about 

the earth at an altitude of between approximately 5600 and 
10,000 nautical miles. The characteristics of the orbits, 

such as the number of orbits, the inclination of each orbit, 
the number of satellites in each orbit and the altitude of the 

satellites, are tailored to maximize the coverage area of the 
satellites and their related line-of-sight elevation angles, 

while minimizing propagation time delays, the number of beam-to-beam 
and satellite-to-satellites handovers, and the total 

number of satellites. The present invention also includes 
several additional features which essentially eliminate beam-to-beam 

and satellite-to-satellite handovers, thus 
dramatically reducing the likelihood of dropouts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to cellular 
telecommunications and, more particularly, to methods attendant to 
satellite-based cellular telecommunications systems. The use of mobile cellular telephones has 
proliferated in the many large metropolitan areas in which 
cellular telecommunications systems have been installed. 
Cellular telecommunications systems provide voice 
communications between a mobile telephone user and fixed 
telephone users or to other mobile telephone users, as well as 
data communications for mobile facsimile machines and modem-equipped 
computers. A typical cellular telephone system 
includes a grid of service zones or cells, with each cell 
having a base station situated near its center. A mobile 
telephone user located in a particular cell is connected to 
that cell's base station through low-power radio frequency 
(rf) transmissions. Each base station is connected by trunk 
lines to a gateway station, which is connected by trunk lines 
to a local and long distance telephone network. The cellular telecommunications systems in use today 
are generally land-based systems that have been installed in 
large metropolitan areas. Small towns and rural areas cannot 
economically justify the installation and operation of one of 
these relatively costly systems. To provide cellular 
telephone service for these areas, satellite-based cellular 
telecommunications systems have been proposed which would 
provide world-wide cellular telephone service. These proposed  
 
cellular telephone systems typically include a large 
constellation of telecommunications satellites in low earth 
orbit at an altitude of between approximately 741 km and 1852 km (400 and 1000 
nautical miles), which is just below the Van Allen radiation 
belt. At these low altitudes, as many as 50 to 80 satellites 
are required to provide adequate coverage of the entire earth. 
This results in an extremely costly and complex system with a 
large number of rapidly changing crosslinks and a large number 
of beam-to-beam and satellite-to-satellite handovers. 
Accordingly, there has been a need for a less costly and 
complex satellite-based cellular telecommunications system. 
The present invention clearly fulfills this need. AIAA 92-2060 "Odyssey, A Constellation For Personal 
Communications" - Roger J. Rusch, Peter Cress, Michael 
Horstein, Robert Huang, Eric Wiswell, March 1992, describes a 
satellite based cellular telephone system for Continental 
United States comprising 12 satellites in 10354 km circular 
orbits with

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling the communication between at 
least one mobile cellular telephone (14), one of a 

plurality of telecommunication satellites (10) forming a 
satellite constellation and at least one other mobile 

cellular telephone (14) or a gateway station (12) in a 
cellular telephone communication system, comprising the 

steps of: 

determining a sequence of different focal directions over 
a predetermined orbital period for at least one antenna 

(16, 18, 20, 22) on each of said satellites (10), with the 
focal direction of said at least one antenna (16, 18, 20, 

22) on each of said satellites (10) being adjusted at a 
rate which is varied during said predetermined orbital 

period, and 
periodically transmitting command information comprising 
data to each of said satellites (10) from at least one 

earth-based control station suitable for adjusting the 
focal direction over said predetermined orbital period of 

said at least one antenna (16, 18, 20, 22) on each of said 
satellites (10) in accordance with said sequence, wherein 
the determination of the sequence of different focal 

directions of said at least one antenna (16, 18, 20, 22) 
for each of said satellites (10) is performed in a 

coordinated manner taking into account the sequence of 
focal direction changes of at least one antenna (16, 18, 

20, 22) of an adjacent satellite (10) during at least a 
portion of said orbital period, wherein the satellite 

constellation provides continuous 24-hour satellite visibility only to 
restricted regions of the earth, and wherein the number of 

satellites, the field of view of said satellites and the 
orbital configuration of said satellite constellation 

combine to provide 24-hour cellular telephone communication

is less than full global coverage.

information that is transmitted to each of said satellites 

(10) comprises boresight locations over time as well as 
varying steering rate commands relative to time. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the rate at 
which the focal direction is adjusted is greater when a 

satellite is arriving or leaving a particular region of 
coverage, than the rate of adjustment required when the 

satellite is more directly over its current region of 
coverage. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the boresight 
of the satellite's antennas remains centered on a given 

assigned service region while said service region is 
visible to said satellite.

of said individual time intervals is related to the speed
