Valve actuating mechanism for an internal combustion 

engine, comprising 

at least two intake valves (E) to each cylinder, 
first valve levers (6) which are adapted to swivel 
about a common shaft (7) and in each case cooperate 

with an intake valve (E) and their own cam (2, 3 and 
4, respectively) on a camshaft (5) for a first engine 

speed range, 
second valve levers (9) which are adapted to 
swivel about the common shaft (7) and cooperate with 

their own cams (8) for a second engine speed range, 
spring elements (18) which hold the second valve 
levers (9) in contact against their cams (8), and 
pistons (12) for coupling the first valve levers 
(6) with the second valve levers (9) in the second 

engine speed range, being provided in bores (11) 
which extend radially to the swivelling shaft (7) and 

being adapted to be displaced outwards by oil 
pressure against the force of a spring (13), 
 
characterised in that 


the pistons (12) are arranged in bores (11) in the 
first valve levers (6), 
the second valve levers (9) are in each case 
arranged between two neighbouring first valve levers 

(6) and cooperate with identical cams (8), 
the free ends of the second valve levers (9) are 
connected to one another by a cross member (10) 

situated in front of and a short distance from the 
free ends of the first valve levers (6), and 
the cross member (10) features a plane lower face 
(10a) with which the pistons (12) cooperate when they 

are displaced outwards. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the pistons (12) are circular  

 
in cross-section and their end portions are provided 

with a plane surface (23) which cooperates with the 
lower face (10a) of the cross member (10) when the 

pistons are displaced outwards. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to claim 2, 
characterised in that an anti-torsion device (24) is 

provided for the pistons (12) and preferably at the 
same time limits the outward movement of the pistons. 
Valve actuating mechanism according to any of claims 
1 to 3, characterised in that in the shaft (7) for 

the valve levers (6, 9) there is provided an oil 
feeder duct (14) which communicates with the bores 

(11) in the first valve levers (6).
