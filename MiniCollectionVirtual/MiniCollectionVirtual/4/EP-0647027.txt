<ABSTRACT>
A current switch circuit for operating with low supply 
voltages while not compromising dynamic range has been provided. 

The current switch circuit includes a differential pair of 
transistors having first (12) and second (20) transistors. The base 

of the first transistor is coupled to a bias voltage (V
B
) while its 
collector is coupled to an output (14) of the current switch circuit. 

The collector of the second transistor is coupled to a first supply 
voltage terminal while the base of the second transistor is coupled 

to a variable bias circuit (22) for alternately swinging the voltage 
applied to the base of the second transistor above or below the bias 

voltage applied to the base of the first transistor. When the 
voltage applied to the base of the second transistor is greater than 

the bias voltage applied to the base of the first transistor, a 
predetermined current is sunk from the output of the current 

switch. Otherwise, substantially zero current flows at the output 
of the current switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to current switch circuits and, in
particular but not limited to, current switch circuits for operating
at low supply voltages while not compromising dynamic range.Current switch circuits may be utilized in a plurality of
applications, for example, in charge pumps for use in phase locked
loops and delay locked loops. Typical current switch circuits
include an N-type differential transistor pair with a known current
being steered out of an output wherein this output may then be
coupled to drive a loop filter. In general, the dynamic range of the
charge pump is limited by the current switch wherein the dynamic
range is limited by the differential transistor pair non-linearity
(i.e. saturation). This typically amounts to approximately a three
VBE voltage limitation. Thus, the dynamic range of typical current
switch circuits have limitations for low operating supply voltages.In order to combat this problem when operating in a phase
locked loop application, the voltage controlled oscillator on the
other side of the loop filter needs to have a high gain in order for
the phase locked loop to cover a large frequency span. However,
this increases the noise sensitivity of the system. US Patent No. 4,280,069 gives examples of emitter coupled circuits.Hence, there exists a need for an improved current switch
circuit for operating at low supply voltages while not
compromising dynamic range.FIG. 1 illustrates a detailed schematic diagram of a first
embodiment of a current switch circuit in accordance with the
present invention; FIG. 2 illustrates a detailed schematic diagram of a second
embodiment of a current switch circuit in accordance with the
present invention; andFIG. 3 illustrates a detailed schematic diagram of a charge
pump circuit utilizing the current switch circuit shown in FIG. 2.Referring to FIG. 1, current switch circuit 10 is shown.
Current switch 10 includes differential transistor pair 12 and 20
wherein transistor 12 has a collector coupled to output terminal
14. The base of transistor 12 is coupled to receive bias voltage VB
wherein bias voltage VB may be either a DC or an AC voltage. The
emitter of transistor 12 is coupled through resistor 18 (RE) and
returned to ground. Further, the emitter of transistor 12 is coupled
to the emitter of transistor 20, the latter having a collector
coupled to the first supply voltage terminal.The base of transistor 20 is coupled to variable bias circuit
22 for alternately switching the voltage applied at the base of
transistor 20 from voltage
