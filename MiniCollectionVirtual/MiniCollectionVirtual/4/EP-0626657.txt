<ABSTRACT>
A face image data processing device which processes 
data on a face image to create the face image suitable for 

an age and presumes the age of the created face image on 
the basis of same. In response to designation of data on 

an age by an age designating unit (5), respective part 
images corresponding to the designated age data are read 

from a storage (7, 10). A face image composed of a 
combination of the read part images and suitable for the 

designated age data is created, and displayed or printed. 
The age of the created face image is presumed from the 

created face image by an age presumption section (1, 17, 
22). The presumed age is displayed/printed along with the 

associated face image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to face image data
processing devices which creates a face image data suitable
for an age.Conventionally, a face image creation device is known
which selects desired patterns of respective parts (for
example, eyes, eyebrows, mouth, etc.,) which compose a face
and have any respective shapes from among a plurality of
sets of different patterns for each of the parts prepared
beforehand, and combines those selected patterns into a
face image. Thus, this process requires much time and
special skills for the creation of the face image. Such a prior art face image device is described e.g. in US-A-5,057,019 (D.W. Harvey)
wherein a data base of sections of a human face is created from sensed digital facial
images of real people, said data base, when stored, can be used to produce different
composite facial images by selecting different human face sections to be combined and
visually displayed.US-A-4,276,570 (N. Burson et al.) discloses a method and apparatus for producing an
image of a person's face of a different age. Starting from a predefined young face and
from a predefined older face of a given person, it is possible to correlate a standard map
consisting of a network of triangles to the two (young and older) faces so that predefined
features in the two facial images can be matched. It is thus possible to calculate a
difference image and thus modifying and displaying a face to be modified with said
difference image so that said face appears aged or younger.It is the object of the invention to provide an improved animal or human being image
display control device and method allowing a user to watch the process of a human
being or an animal growing old.This object is solved by the subject matters of independent claims 1 and 12.Preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent claims.The invention is advantageous in that it allows for rapidly and easily displaying images
without requiring any special skills.The invention will be explained in the following on the basis of the drawings in which: 
FIG. 1 shows the whole circuit structure of a face
image creation device according to a first embodiment of
the present invention.Fig. 2 shows an illustrative arrangement of part
patterns of each of faces, data on which is stored in a
part pattern ROM.FIG. 3 shows an illustrative part pattern of each of
faces, data on which is stored, for the respective ages in
the corresponding age part pattern ROMs.FIG. 4 shows an illustrative arrangement of part
patterns for wrinkles, data on which is

An animal or human being image display control device for sequentially
displaying images (F1 - F4) of an animal or human being, each image

including characteristic data items such as eyes, a mouth and a nose, said
images being stored in image storage means (9) and displayed on display

means (11), the device comprising:

first image display control means (1) for controlling said display means to
display thereon a first image stored in said image storage means (9);
first age display control means (1) for controlling said display means to
display thereon an age corresponding to the first image as a first age;
a time counter (13A) for counting time;
update means (1) for updating the first age to a second age based on a period
of lapsed time counted by said time counter, and for replacing the first image

with a second image including said data items, each data item corresponding
to the second age;
second image display control means (1) for controlling said display means to
display thereon the second image; and
second age display control means (1) for controlling said display means to
display thereon the second age.
The device according to claim 1, wherein

the time counter is arranged for counting the current time; and
said update means is arranged for updating the age on the basis of both the
current time counted by said time counter and predetermined reference data.
The device according to claim 1, wherein

the time counter is arranged for counting a lapse of time; and
said update means is arranged for updating the age on the basis of the lapse of
time counted by said time counter.
The device according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein

said image storage means and said display means are beforehand connected to
said first and second image display control means.
The device according to one of claims 1 to 4, further comprising:

an externally operable switching section (4) operable by a user; and
age storage means for storing an age corresponding to each of said characteristic
data items included in said animal or human being images;

wherein said first and second age display control means is responsive to said
externally operable switching section being operated for controlling said display

means so as to display the age stored in said age storage means corresponding
to the displayed animal or human being image.
