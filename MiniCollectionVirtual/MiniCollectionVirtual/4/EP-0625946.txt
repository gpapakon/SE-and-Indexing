<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of controlling the stability of a vehicle. According to this method a reference yaw speed is determined and on actual yaw speed is measured. These two values are compared and the result used to bring the actual yaw-moment acceleration towards the reference value. The reference yaw speed determined accommodates the wishes of the driver to change direction and to accelerate or decelerate the vehicle.

Method for controlling the vehicle stability in 
which the steering angle δ, the yaw rate ω, the vehicle 

velocity v
F
 are determined and in which a steady-state 
required yaw rate ω
soll0
 is determined from the 
parameters δ and v
F
 in accordance with the relationship 

ω

 δ 
 
where V
ch
 is a vehicle characteristic velocity and L is 
the wheel base, and in which the required value of the 

yaw rate ω
soll
 is compared with the yaw rate ω which has 
been determined and, with the aid of the deviation Δω, 

the yaw rate is influenced in the sense of matching it 
to the required yaw rate, characterized in that a 

factor x is determined by means of which the steady-state 
yaw rate ω
soll0
 is multiplied in order to gain 
the required yaw rate ω
soll
, in that the factor x is 
determined by means of the relationship 


x = 
F

F

where F
ges
 is the available total force between the 
tyres and the road and F
ges,W
 is the total force  
 

desired by the driver, in that F

 is determined by 
means of the relationship 


F

force F

factor x is limited to 1. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the resultant tyre forces at the individual wheels 

are determined and in that the sum of the tyre forces 
is formed in order to gain F

Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the total force F

 is determined from the total 
longitudinal force F

 and the total transverse force F

Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that F

transverse accelerations while taking account of the 

vehicle mass m. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the required yaw rate is reduced 

when the available forces do not suffice for the 
desired change in motion. 
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in 

that the factor x is increased when the wish for side  
 

force is reduced but the side force is small relative 
to the longitudinal force. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that ω

required by the relationship 


ω

Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the required yaw rate value ω

is subjected to low-pass filtering to match the phases 

of ω and ω

Method according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that with increasing steering angle, 

the required yaw rate signal is fed through a 
differentiating filter and in that the amplified output 

signal ω

yaw rate signal ω
