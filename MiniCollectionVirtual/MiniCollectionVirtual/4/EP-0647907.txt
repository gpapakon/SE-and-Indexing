<ABSTRACT>
A data processing apparatus in which data of a book edited by 
the use of various element data of one page such as documents, 

illustrations, and photographs are decomposed into those 
concerning layout and those concerning elements to be stored. 

The data processing apparatus is provided with data retrieval 
means which comprises data retrieval table memory means having 

titles and indexes memorized in the hierarchical structure 
therein, n'th rank index input means for admitting n'th rank 

data indexes, data selection means for selecting (n+1)'th rank 
data corresponding to the n'th rank index from the data 

retrieval table memory means, data existence discrimination 

means for performing the decision as to whether or not the 
(n+1)'th rank data are present in the data retrieval table 

memory means, and element data reading means for reading data 
out of the element data memory means when the presence of the 

(n+1)'th rank data is confirmed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a data processing system.
More particularly this invention relates to a data
processing system which is capable of easy and efficient
retrieval of data.This invention is described in the context of an editing apparatus
aided by the data processing system. More particularly
an editing apparatus is described that posseses
protective functions controlled by Security No. and enables
handling manuals such as for automobiles and electric
appliances, books in general, magazines, and newspapers
(hereinafter referred to collectively as "books") to be
edited quickly and easily.In recent years, the practice of performing the work of
editing a book by the use of a personal computer or a work
station (editing device) has been disseminated. In this
case, the work of editing a book is carried out by newly
feeding complete data on documents, illustrations, etc. for
each of the pages, with the whole information of an edited
book memorized as separated in units of page. With the 
conventional editing apparatus, however, those documents,
illustrations, etc. which appear in two or more places
cannot be utilized in common but must be repeatedly fed in
all over. The conventional editing apparatus, therefore,
takes up much time and labor in the production of a book.
The production of a book, accordingly, is very expensive.From "Muse: A Multimedia Filing System" IEEE Software 4
(1987) March, No. 2, New York, NY, USA, a filing system is
known that features flexible document retrieval. For
retrieval, documents are stored according to a conceptual
structure, which is used to classify documents into types.
The document types are stored in a hierarchy. These
document types are described as important for retrieval,
because queries can be expressed as conditions on thin
components.This invention provides processing means capable of
efficient retrieval of data necessary for a new book from
an already accumulated data base. Generally, in the
retrieval of data by a data processing apparatus, the
wanted data are obtained by assigning titles (items)
corresponding to various kinds of data registered in
advance and , at the time of actual retrieval, introducing
an item corresponding to a specific kind of data
(hereinafter referred to as "data item") wanted into the
data processing apparatus.In a typical conventional data retrieval means, the items
mentioned above are registered in advance in a hierarchical
structure, the concepts of the items are sequentially
defined by the use of input means for data items, and a
