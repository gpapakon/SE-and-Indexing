<ABSTRACT>
The device has a storage section (10) with two magnet arrangements (13, 14), arranged in parallel, on both sides of a vertical centre plane (18), the clearance between the magnet arrangements corresponding essentially to the outside diameter of the covers (3). At least one device (6; 7, 12) feeds the covers (3) taken from the first production unit (2) vertically into the storage section (10), from which they are removed by another device (22) and fed to the other production unit (26).

Device for taking up and conveying container lids or
round blanks (3) made from ferromagnetic material from a first

production unit (2) and for delivering them to a further
production unit (26) with


a storage section (10) with two parallel magnet
arrangements (1
3, 14) on both sides of a vertical plane
of symmetry (18), wherein when the device is in use the

clear distance between the magnet arrangements (13, 14)
corresponds substantially to the external diameter of

the lids (3),
at least one arrangement (6, 7) for taking up the lids
(3) from the first production direction (2) and for

vertical delivery of the lids (3) to the storage section
(10), and
an arrangement (22) for removing the lids (3) from the
storage section (10) and delivering them to the further

production unit (26),

characterised in that
the storage section (10) is disposed substantially
horizontally and is provided with a limit (30, 31) in

each longitudinal direction,
the limit (30) of the storage section (10) adjacent to
the arrangement (22) for delivering the lids (3) to the

further production unit (26) is constructed as a fixed
stop, and
the limit (31) lying opposite the arrangement (22) for
delivering the lids to the further production 

arrangement (26) is constructed as a stop which is
movably guided in the longitudinal direction of the

storage section (10).
Device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the
magnet arrangements (13, 14) consist in each case of U-shaped

magnets which are open to the vertical plane of symmetry (18).
Device as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that the
U-shaped magnets in each case consist of two rows (15, 16) of

magnets which are disposed one above the other, are separated
from one another by a strip (17) of antimagnetic material and

are connected to one another towards the rear by a yoke plate
(19), wherein magnets which are disposed in mirror image to

the vertical plane of symmetry (18) and are disposed above or
below one another have opposite polarities.
Device as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that each
row (15, 16) of magnets is constructed with two magnets which

are disposed behind one another - viewed in the transverse
direction.
Device as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the magnet arrangements (13, 14) are covered at least

on their side facing the vertical plane of symmetry (18) with
a plate (39) of antimagnetic material with a low-friction

surface, the clear distance for passage of the lids (3) being
given by the plates (39).
Device as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that the movable stop (31) is movable by a linear drive

(33).
Device as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in that the
linear drive (33) is controllable by switches (35 to 37) which

count the number of lids (3) contained in the storage section 
(10).
Device as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in that the
linear drive (33) is controllable by a sensor (38) which

detects the position of the penultimate lid in each case
before the fixed limit (30).
Device as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the arrangement for delivering the lids

(3) is connected by means of gearing to the drive for the
further production unit (26).
