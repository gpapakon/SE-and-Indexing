<ABSTRACT>
The present method and apparatus determines an 
interference-free trajectory for fitting a moving solid 

body into a cavity, particularly where the body has a 
complex shape and tightly fits into the cavity. The method 

begins by describing the body surface with a finite set of 
body surface elements and the cavity surface with a finite 

set of cavity surface elements. Then a set of surface 
element pairs is determined. Each set comprises a body 

surface element and a corresponding cavity surface element. 
A neighborhood is a volume that contains the pair of 

surface elements but no other surface element pairs or 
parts of surface elements. Body motion constraints are 

developed for each pair. The constraints do not allow the 
body motion to cause the surface elements in the pair to 

interpenetrate or to leave their respective neighborhood. 
An incremental movement 
of the body, along a preferred 
direction, is then determined subject to the constraints. 

The body is moved the incremental amount and the process is 
repeated with a new set of pairs. 
Apparatus using the method can without interferences insert 
bodies into cavities or design and/or manufacture bodies 

and/or cavities with interference-free insertion trajectories. 
The invention has specific application to the design 

and insertion of prosthetic implants.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of inserting a solid 
body into a cavity without encountering interferences. 
More specifically, the invention relates to inserting a 
prosthetic implant into an anatomical structure during 
reconstructive surgery. Moving a solid object from one location to another location 
without bumping or penetrating fixed obstacles on its way 
is a classical problem that has many applications in many 
fields. This problem is commonly called the motion planning 
problem (also called the path planning or the piano 
movers problem). In this problem, the goal is to find an 
interference-free (also called collision-free or non-overlapping) 
trajectory for a collection of moving objects 
amidst fixed obstacles from an initial to final configuration. 
An instance of the motion planning problem that is 
relevant here is the so-called "peg-in-hole" problem, in 
which a moving peg (the body) is to be inserted without 
interferences into a fixed hole (the fixed obstacle). Typically, 
the peg and the hole are tightly fit, so that the 
clearance between the peg and the hole is small and the peg 
and hole shapes are almost complementary. This requires 
fine motions to insert the peg into the hole. The 
interference-free insertion problem is related to the 
design and modification of the peg and hole shapes such 
that the peg will not get stuck during its insertion inside 
the hole. A fundamental reference that formulates and 
describes solutions for this class of problems is Robot 
Motion Planning by Jean-Claude Latombe published by Kluwer  
 
Academic Publishers dated 1991, which is herein incorporated 
by reference in its entirety. Solutions to the peg-in-hole problem have many applications 
in molding, manufacturing, assembly, medicine, and 
robotics, among others, in which a solid body is to be 
inserted or removed along a complex interference-free trajectory 
into a cavity. The analysis and solution of the 
interference-free insertion problem is used for designing 
tighter fits (force fits) for machine parts, for designing 
easily assemblable machines, for designing removable molds 
in part manufacturing, and for designing medical implants, 
among others. There are basically two types of motion planning problems 
(including peg-in-hole): 1. those where the trajectory from 
the initial to the final configuration is known and 2. 
those where the trajectory is unknown and must be determined. 
In the first type of problem, the solid body trajectory 
from the initial to the final
