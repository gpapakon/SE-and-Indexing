<ABSTRACT>
A method of implanting an acetabular cup (2) which 
includes preparing an acetabular socket (1) to receive said cup, 

placing cement in said socket before or after locating a 
loading tube (7) in line with said socket and inserting the 

acetabular cup through the tube into said socket by pushing 
it down the tube with an inserter (6) to a predetermined 

position therein defined by stop means (8) acting on said 
inserter or an attachment thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for implanting an 
acetabular cup which is to be held in place by cement. It is known, for example, from the Charnley (type) ogee Flanged 
Cup to provide a flange on the cup to pressurise the cement but this 
only occurs as the cup approaches its final position in the 
acetabulum. The flexible flange touches the acetabular margin tending 
to occlude cement flow. Another device for pressurising cement is known as the Exeter 
Acetabular Pressuriser. In this arrangement a water filled seal 
mounted on the end of a handle is used after the acetabulum has been 
filled with cement but before the cup is introduced, the seal covers 
the acetabulum and the surgeon pushes on the handle thereby forcing the 
doughy cement in the holes, ridges and trabeculae. When the instrument 
is removed and pressure is released blood flow can squeeze between the 
cement and the bone. EP 0 535 973 which is used as a basis for the preamble of claim 1 
describes a surgical instrument for inserting 
acetabular cups and which may also be used to maintain pressure on the 
cup while the bone cement is setting. In the construction described 
the cup to be inserted is placed on a hemispherical button and pressure 
is maintained through a trigger mechanism. There is however no means 
for guiding or aligning the cup into the acetabular socket or for 
locating it at a predetermined position therein. It is also known to provide cup positioning instruments with 
long pointers (vertical, horizontal and at right angles to the 
patient's centre line of body symmetry) to enable the surgeon to 
control cup orientation reasonably well provided the pelvis does not 
move. Linear positioning of the cup is determined by eye in a 
medio-lateral and anterio-posterior sense. If the natural acetabulum 
is well formed a by-eye judgement can be acceptable but many acetabulae 
are deformed or eroded in which case by-eye judgement can be confused.  
 A further method is to use what are usually referred to as 
acetabular spacers. These can be lugs fixed to the outside of the 
acetabular cup or can be press studs pushed into the bone base of the 
natural acetabulum. These prevent the cup from being pushed too deeply 
into the acetabular socket and can control medio-lateral and 
anterio-posterior positioning. However, they force some degree of 
centralisation of the cup. If the surgeon chooses to place the cup 
eccentrically to make use of a particular area of solid bone support, 
acetabular spacers do not help. The present

Apparatus for implanting an acetabular cup characterised by a 
loading tube (7) adapted for alignment with an acetabular socket (1), the bove of said 

tube 7 being 
dimensioned to receive a suitably dimensioned acetabular cup (2) as a sliding fit to guide 

it into said socket (1), an inserter (11) for 
pushing said acetabular cup (2) down said tube (7), and stop means 

(8) (17) which act on said inserter (11) or an attachment (18) thereto 
to limit movement of said inserter (11) down said tube (7) to a 

predetermined position therein. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that said 
inserter (11) acts on the rim of the cup (2). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 characterised in that said 
inserter (11) is in the form of a piston which is a sliding fit within 

the bore of the tube (7). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of preceding claims 1, 2 or 3 
characterised in that said stop means (8) are provided on part of the 

bore of said tube (7) and act on the inner end of the inserter (11). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of preceding claims 1, 2 or 3 
characterised in that said stop means (17) are provided on the inserter 

(11) and engage an abutment on said tube (7) located at a position 
paced away from the end of the tube (7) which is intended to be 

adjacent the acetabular socket (12) when in use. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of preceding claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that the diameter of said tube (7) is adjustable. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of preceding claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that said tube (7) is provided with a flexible skirt 

(4). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7 characterised in that said 
skirt (4) is detachable from said tube (7).  

 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8 characterised in 
that said skirt (4) is provided with a cement escape control orifice 

(13). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 7, 8 or 9 
characterised in that said skirt (4) is corrugated (5). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that one end of said tube (7) has a wedge or slope 

shaped orientation (A). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that one end of said tube (7) is deformable. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims 
characterised by means (30) for orientating the tube (7) and/or 

skirt (4) on the bone into which a cup (2) is to be inserted. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of preceding claims 1 to 13 
characterised in that said tube (7) and/or skirt (4) are made from a 

synthetic plastics material. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 14 characterised in that said 
skirt (4) is made from polyethylene, polypropylene or polyurethane. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 16 characterised in that said 
skirt (4) is made from a resorbable material. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 16 characterised in that said 
skirt (4) is made from polyglycolic acid or polylactic acid. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of preceding claims 
characterised by including means (19) for adjusting the position of 

said stop means (17).  
 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of preceding claims 1 to 18 
characterised in that said stop means (17) can be adjusted removed or 

overridden to allow said inserter (11) to be moved further down said 
tube beyond said predetermined position. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 19 characterised in that said 
stop means is provided by a resiliently biased catch (92) which can 

engage in a slot (84) provided in the wall of said tube (80) and which 
can move to an inoperative position to allow said inserter (90) to pass 

beyond a predetermined position. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that a lower portion of the tube (7)(80) is of reduced 

external diameter. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the lower end of said tube (7)(80) which is
