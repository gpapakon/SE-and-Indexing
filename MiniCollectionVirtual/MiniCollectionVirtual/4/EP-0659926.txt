<ABSTRACT>
An ironing board (1) has an excellent strength, on 
which wearing apparel (W) can be easily set (in a state be 

in wear), with which a shoulder portion (W2) corresponding 
to the proximal portion of the sleeve of the wearing 

apparel can be easily ironed, and which has an arcuated 
ironing surface, so that the wearing apparel is set in 

an appropriately strained state with a light ironing 
operation without forming wrinkles, while a certain 

section modulus is maintained. This ironing board is 
used in combination with an iron having a flat bottom 

surface as an ironing surface, and includes a base 
portion (2) having long side edge portions (2a) and short side 

edge portions (2b,2c), a first projection (5) extending from a 
substantially central position of one of the short side 

edge portions (2c), and second projections (3,4) extending from 
right and left symmetrical positions of the long side 

edge portions (2a) near the one short side edge portion (2c) to 
form shoulder portions (3,4) corresponding to portions (W2) of 

wearing apparel extending from the proximal portions of 
sleeves to shoulders of the wearing apparel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ironing board 
suitable for ironing wearing apparel. Conventionally, an ironing board is known which 
has, in addition to its main flat portion having a 
large area, a small-width portion to fit in a 
cylindrical portion, e.g., a sleeve portion of wearing 
apparel or children's trousers, thereby enabling 
ironing such a small, cylindrical portion. An ironing board having an ironing surface with a 
special shape is proposed, e.g., as "an ironing board 
for shirts and dresses" disclosed in U.S.P. No. 
2,803,897. The applicant of the present application 
previously proposed "an arcuated ironing board having a 
number of projections on its surface" in U.S.P. 
No. 4,903,421 and Reissued Patent Re. 34,450. However, in the ironing boards described above, 
when ironing particularly the sleeve portions of 
wearing apparel, the proximal portions of the sleeve 
portions corresponding to the shoulders of a human body 
cannot be ironed, since the shoulder portions cannot be 
fitted on the ironing board. According to the "ironing 
board for shirts and dresses" of U.S.P. No. 2,803,897, 
the shoulder portions can be fitted on the ironing  
 
board. However, the shoulder portion of wearing 
apparel is slightly rounded in accordance with the 
shape of a human body. When ironing is to be 
performed, the wearing apparel is not uniformly 
stretched even by utilizing any portion of the ironing 
board. Thus, wrinkles are formed in the ironed wearing 
apparel, leading to an unsatisfactory result. Since 
the "ironing board for shirts and dresses" does not 
have a neck portion, the collar of wearing apparel 
cannot be ironed, and the wearing apparel cannot be set 
on the ironing board by using a neck portion as a 
guide. The present invention has been made in view of the 
above problems, and has as its object to provide an 
ironing board having an excellent strength, on which 
wearing apparel can be easily set (in a state be in 
wear), with which a shoulder portion corresponding to 
the proximal portion of the sleeve of the wearing 
apparel can be easily ironed, and which has an arcuated 
ironing surface, so that the wearing apparel is set in 
an appropriately strained state with a light ironing 
operation without forming wrinkles, while a certain 
section modulus is maintained. In addition to the above object, it is another 
object of the present invention to provide an ironing  
 
board with which the steam from an iron can 
sufficiently act on wearing apparel. In addition to 
the above

<CLAIMS>
An ironing board used in combination with an iron 
having a flat bottom surface as an ironing surface, 

comprising: 
   a base portion having long side edge portions and 

short side edge portions, said base portion forming a 
predetermined curved surface to extend from a central 

portion thereof in a longitudinal direction thereof 
toward said long side edge portions such that said 

central portion projects toward said ironing surface, 
thereby being brought into substantially linear contact 

with the iron; 
   a first projection extending from a substantially 

central position of one of said short side edge portions; 
and 

   second projections extending from right and left 
symmetrical positions of said long side edge portions 

near said one short side edge portion to form shoulder 
portions corresponding to portions of wearing apparel 

extending from proximal portions of sleeves to shoulders 
of the wearing apparel. 
An ironing board as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that said predetermined curved surface 

has a smaller radius of curvature at portions thereof 
extending toward said long side edge portions of said 

base portion. 
An ironing board as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that foldable leg means are disposed on 

a lower surface of said base portion. 
An ironing board as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that there are provided a felt cushion 

member covering the entire surface of said base portion, 
and a cover member to be put on said cushion member. 
An ironing board as claimed in claim 4, 
characterised in that said cover member is formed with 

longitudinal and lateral lines extending in the 
longitudinal and lateral directions of said base portion. 
An ironing board as claimed in any one of claims 1-5, 
characterised in that said base portion comprises a 

metal plate having a large number of pores. 
An ironing board as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised in that said base portion comprises
