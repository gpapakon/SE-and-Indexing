<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connecting element for conveyor belts (2), in particular having a cross-sectionally U-shaped basic body (3) which exhibits at least one approximately semi-circular coupling eyelet (4) and retaining legs (5, 6) with a through-passage opening (7, 8) for at least one fastening means (9). The essence of the invention consists in the fact that the fastening means (9) is in the form of a pin and exhibits two blunt ends (14, 14').

A connecting element for conveyor belts (2) comprising a main 
body (3) which is U-shaped in cross-section and which has at least one 

approximately semicircular coupling eye (4) with a material thickness 
(S
1
) which in the radial direction is twice as large as the material 
thickness (S
2
) of holding limbs (5, 6) in the region of their through 
openings (7, 8), wherein the holding limbs (5, 6) taper in a wedge-like 

configuration from the large cross-section (S1) of the coupling eyes (4) 
towards the smaller cross-section (S
2
), and wherein the through openings 
(7, 8) each have at the outsides (5', 6') of the holding limbs (5, 6) 

respective conical recesses (7a, 8a) and respective annular ridges (13) 
at the conveyor belt side, and wherein there are provided pin-shaped 

fixing means (9) with flat end faces (15) at their blunt ends (14) and 
(14') respectively and are intended for peening over in the conical 

recesses (7a, 8a) of the holding limbs (5, 6). 
A connecting element according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the pin-shaped fixing means (9) is of a length which is cut to a final 

dimension (L). 
A connecting element according to at least one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the fixing means (9) comprises a high-strength 

material. 
A connecting element according to at least one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the one blunt end (14') of the fixing means 

(9) is a rivet head (14"). 
A connecting element according to at least one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the diameter of the through opening (7) into 

which the end (14) of the fixing means (9) passes in the fixing operation 
is about 0.1 mm larger than the diameter of the other through opening 

(8).  
 
A connecting element according to at least one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that each two coupling eyes (4) and the 

associated holding limbs (5, 6) are integral and that preferably both 
holding limbs (5, 6) have recesses (12) which gradually taper off as a 

prolongation of the gap (11) between the coupling eyes (4). 
A method of fixing connecting elements according to claim 1 and 
possibly one or more of claims 2 to 6 characterised in that the pin-shaped 

fixing means (9) is pressed with its blunt end (14, 14') leading 
through the belt end (16) and that the blunt leading end (14) and 

possibly also the second blunt end (14') are then peened-over or anchored 
by pressure and deformation. 
A method according to one or more of the preceding claims 

characterised in that the blunt end or ends (14, 14') are spread open by 
means of at least one bar (19, 20) having a point (21, 22).
