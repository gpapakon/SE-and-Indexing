<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a self-fading color adhesive. Upon application, the adhesive exhibits coloring which enables confirmation of coating area and weight of the adhesive. Upon drying, the adhesive fades to clear. The self-fading color adhesive comprises the following components: a) clear or slightly colored organic solvent type adhesive, b) basic material which readily volatilizes at ambient temperatures, c) acid-base indicator which is colored in basic environment and turns clear in non-basic environment, and optionally d) spraying agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sprayable adhesive that, when 
applied to a substrate, exhibits a color that confirms 
where it has been applied and then fades upon drying. For the purpose of confirming the area coated and 
the weight of the adhesive applied when adhesives are 
sprayed, adhesives colored by pigments or dyes have 
been used. Such adhesives do not fade or change color 
after spraying and drying, and are consequently 
undesirable for many applications. DE-A-2 508 653 describes an adhesive which is tinted in the mass but loses 
its coloring immediately after it is spread on paper. The adhesive is mixed 
with an indicator dye that is colored in the alkaline range but which 
reverses into a colorless phase when in contact with an alkali-absorbing 
media. The reference states that the transition of the color indicator dye 
into its colorless phase can take place over time under the influence of 
air, but that this deficiency can be eliminated by the addition of 
triethanolamine or triisopropylamine which improves the fastness of the 
coloration of the mass. This reference fails to teach a colored, sprayable 
adhesive which fades to clear upon evaporation of a basic material. The present invention provides a sprayable 
adhesive, that, immediately after 
application, exhibits a color which allows confirmation 
of the area coated and the weight of the adhesive 
applied. The color of the adhesive subsequently fades 
to clear upon drying.  
 The present invention relates to a self-fading, sprayable 
color adhesive. The self-fading color adhesive shows 
a color immediately after spraying and said color fades 
with the passage of time. In general it can be used 
advantageously where it is desirable to see the portion 
of the substrate initially treated with adhesive, but 
where it would be undesirable for the final adhesive to 
have color. For example, in applications involving 
thin, clear or lightly colored substrates, it may be 
undesirable to have the adhesive permanently colored, 
since the adhesive would permanently distort the color 
of the substrate.  
 The invention is directed towards 
incorporating a color changing acid-base indicator into 
sprayable adhesives. More specifically, the self-fading 
color adhesive of the present invention 
comprises the following components: (a) clear or 
slightly colored organic solvent type adhesive, (b) 
basic material which readily volatilizes at ambient 
temperatures, (c) acid-base indictor which is colored 
in basic environment and turns clear in non-basic
