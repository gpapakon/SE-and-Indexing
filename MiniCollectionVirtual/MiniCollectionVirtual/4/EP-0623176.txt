<ABSTRACT>
The proposal relates to an ultra-sensitive process for detecting reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in three steps. In the first step the material to be examined is processed placing a template primer combination in a reaction mixture and using the RT activity in the processed material to be examined to prepare a nucleic acid to be multiplied in a given nucleic acid amplification process in such a way that such a substance can be produced only if there is RT activity in the material to be examined. In the second step, the nucleic acid to be increased is amplified to provide an amplification product. In the third step, the amplification product is analyzed and identified. The sensitivity increase as against prior art RT assays is increased by an order of several millions, thus facilitating the ultra-sensitive detection of RT activity and hence the detection of all retroviruses and all other retro-elements which contain or express active RT. The process is important in the diagnosis of infections and diseases caused thereby in humans, animals and plants. Screening and typing kits are proposed for examination and diagnosis.
