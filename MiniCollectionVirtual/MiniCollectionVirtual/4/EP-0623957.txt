<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing 
a lead frame (1) from a metal plate, 

wherein outer leads (4) of the lead 
frame (1) and outer portions (3b) of 

inner leads (3) are formed by etching 
metal plate (11). The inner portions 

(3a) of the inner leads are then 
laser beam machined with the connecting 

portions (7) left as they are 
so that the front end portions of the 

inner leads (3) are joined. A mechanical 
surface treatment and a chemical 

surface treatment are then conducted, 
and dross (10), spatters (9) and oxide 

film which are deposited or formed 
during the laser beam machining operation 

are thereby removed. The 
portions which are on the inner side 

of the inner leads (3), and which are 
connected to the terminals of a semiconductor 

device, are then plated with 
gold to form plated terminal portions 

(3A). The region excluding the region of the outer leads (4) is coated with a solder plating protecting film, and 
the outer leads (4) are solder plated. The connecting portions (7) left at the front ends of the inner leads (3) are 

then cut off by laser beam machining, and the inner leads (3) are thus sepa-rated 
from one another to form a final 

lead frame pattern. The solder plating protecting film is then removed, and the lead frame is washed and dried. This 
enables the occurence of bend, which is ascribed to the thermal deformation of the lead frame during the laser beam 

machining operation, of the inner leads (3) within the plate surfaces to be prevented, and the manufacturing of lead 
frames to be done with a high precision. The invention can solve various problems with the laser beam machining.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of processing
lead frames on which semiconductor elements are mounted,
and more particularly to a lead frame processing method
suitable for processing lead frames of fine shapes and
highly accurate dimensions which are employed to mount
high-density and high-integration semiconductor elements,
etc.Lead frames are made of thin metallic plates in which
patterns such as inner leads and outer leads are formed
with predetermined gaps left between the leads. In such a
lead frame, after mounting a semiconductor chip thereon,
terminals of the semiconductor chip and the inner leads are
electrically connected to each other.Recently, there has been an ever stronger demand for a
higher packing density and higher integration of semiconductor
elements. Corresponding to the demand, lead frames
for mounting semiconductor elements thereon have also been
developed which are of fine shapes and highly accurate
dimensions. In QFP type semiconductor devices, particularly,
great weight has been given to increase the number of
pins per lead frame. At the present, a lead frame having 
the number of leads in excess of 300 pins is manufactured.
With an increase in the number of pins per lead frame, it
has been required to develop a lead frame wherein inner
leads adjacent to a semiconductor element are smaller in
pitch and finer in shape. For example, while the inner
lead pitch has been about 200 Âµm at minimum in the prior
art, the pitch smaller than that level is required nowadays.Such a lead frame having a number of pins and a small
pitch has been primarily processed by etching and pressing
in the past. By these processing methods, the lead frame
can be manufactured relatively efficiently and easily.JP, A, 2-247089 corresponding to EP-A-0 363 679 discloses a method of forming the
portions where the pitch is not so small, such as outer
leads and notches around a die pad, by the pressing or
etching process, and then forming inner leads by laser
cutting successively. In this method, only the inner leads
having a small pitch is processed by laser cutting.JP, A, 4-37493 discloses a method by which the portions
which have been etched but not thoroughly the total
thickness of a plate to be processed, i.e., the portions
where the plate has not been pierced in the direction of
plate thickness by etching, are subject to irradiation of a
laser beam in a post-process so as to pierce the plate.JP, A, 62-93095 discloses a method of changing (expanding
or contracting) the section of a laser beam into
