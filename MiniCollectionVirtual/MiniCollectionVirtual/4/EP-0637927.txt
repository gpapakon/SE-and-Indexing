<ABSTRACT>
A hospital bed (100) supported on a wheeled base (104), and a ventilator (26) supported on a wheeled cart (18) and docked to the base, the combination capable of being rolled as a single unit. The ventilator cart (18) includes a wheeled base (20), and supports (24), for supporting the ventilator, with raising and lowering the ventilator. The bed base (104) is wheeled and has a generally Y-shaped base frame (110). The outspread arms (112) of the Y-shaped frame (110) receives the ventilator cart (18). The ventilator when docked to the bed base falls within the footprint (126) of the bed (100). A latch (118, 120) secures the ventilator to the bed base. A disabling switch (120) disables the high/low function of the bed preventing the bed from being lowered downwardly onto the ventilator. A power supply (122) mounted to the bed base provides for uninterrupted operation the ventilator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to medical
equipment, and more particularly to the integration of
patient life support systems into the dimensions of a
hospital bed. More specifically, this invention
relates to patient ventilators and carts for supporting
ventilators in combination with hospital beds for
movement with the beds.The patient critical care environment in
hospitals is becoming increasingly crowded due to the
number of pieces of medical equipment associated with
critical care, which pieces of equipment embody
various critical care technologies. Specifically,
within the critical care environment there is generally
located a critical care bed, around which are
positioned a ventilator, I.V. pumps, various monitors,
and one or more computer terminals for entering
patient care data. The numerosity of pieces of
equipment spaced about a critical care hospital room 
and the patient bed results in patient care inefficiency,
as a care provider must continually monitor
and operate all the pieces of equipment, while such
are not advantageously ergonomically arranged.In addition to the critical care environment
being crowded and somewhat cumbersome around which to
work, the transfer of the various pieces of equipment
along with the patient on the critical care bed from
one room to another within the hospital is tedious,
time consuming and difficult to manage. One reason is
that the critical care bed, and the various technologies
associated with the critical care environment,
are generally each individually supported on
wheeled support structures. Therefore, when transferring
the patient from one room to another room,
several pieces of wheeled equipment must simultaneously
be rolled to the new location. Not only is this
task cumbersome, but also it is time consuming.
Further, since all the various technologies must be
first disconnected from their respective connections
to AC power at the wall in the room, the various technologies
must either operate on some sort of stand-by
scheme during transportation, or must be manually
operated. Swift transfer of the various pieces of
equipment with the critical care bed from one room to
another is mandatory in order to minimize down time on
these pieces of equipment yet is made very difficult 
by the clutter associated with the several individual
pieces of equipment.U.S. Patent 4584989 discloses an arrangement where
a wheel mounted balloon pump can be connected to a bed by
bars or rails, the two then rolling as a unit on both the
bed wheels and wheels on which the

<CLAIMS>
A combination comprising a hospital bed (100) with
opposite head and foot ends having a base (104) including

wheels (114) thereon and a patient support (106) mounted
on the base (104), a ventilator (26) supported on a cart

(18, 150), the cart (18, 150) including wheels (22, 181)
thereon, and means (116, 118) for docking at least one of

the ventilator (26) and cart (18, 150) to the base (104)
of the bed, the ventilator (26) and cart (18, 150) being

positioned at one of the ends of the bed (100) on
docking, the combination thereby being rollable as a

unit, characterised in that the ventilator (26) and cart
(18, 150) are positioned underneath the patient support

(106) on docking.
A combination as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the
bed (100) defines a footprint (126) on a floor surface

therebelow by projecting downwardly thereon a periphery
of the bed, and wherein the ventilator (26) is positioned

within the bed footprint (126) on docking.
A combination as claimed in either Claim 1 or
Claim 2 wherein the bed base (104) is generally Y-shaped

having a pair of spaced arms (112) at one end.
A combination as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the
ventilator (26) and cart (108, 150) are positioned within 

the spaced arms (112) on docking.
A combination as claimed in any preceding Claim
wherein the ventilator (26) is positioned at the head end

of the bed (100) on docking.
A combination as claimed in any preceding Claim
wherein the docking means includes means (120) for

preventing the patient support (106) mounted on the base
(104) from being lowered onto the ventilator (26).
A combination as claimed in any preceding Claim
wherein the docking means (116, 118) includes means for

powering the ventilator (26).
A combination as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to
6 wherein one of the base (104), ventilator (26) and cart

(108, 150) includes a power supply means (122) thereon
for powering the ventilator (26).
A combination as claimed in Claim 8 wherein the
power supply means (122) is mounted on the base (104).
