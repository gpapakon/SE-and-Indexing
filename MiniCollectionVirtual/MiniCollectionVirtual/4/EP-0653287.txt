<ABSTRACT>
A method for fabricating an in-mold graphics surface (16). A 
layer of an etchable material(12) is molded on a contrasting surface (13). 

The layer is then etched to expose the contrasting surface and produce 
the in-mold graphics surface. In another embodiment, a layer of 

hardcoat material (11) is molded over the etchable layer. The etching is 
accomplished by using a laser beam to selectively etch the etchable layer, 

while not etching the contrasting surface. The hardcoat layer (11), the 
etchable layer ( 12), and the contrasting surface (13) can be molded to a 

larger part (14) during an injection molding process. The graphic 
design is later etched in the part to produce a customized des
ign.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to methods of graphics 
fabrication, and more specifically to a method of creating graphic 
images in molded materials. Plastic parts have traditionally been marked or decorated by hot 
stamping, silk screening, or painting. In each of these operations, the 
marking or decoration is placed on the exterior of the plastic part in a 
secondary operation. One major disadvantage of these techniques is that 
the marking or design, being on the exterior surface of the part, is 
subject to degradation by erosion or wear. For example, plastic keypad 
buttons on typewriters and computer keyboards are subject to constant 
wear by human fingers actuating the keys. Over a period of time, the 
printed ink on the keys becomes worn away, making the keyboard 
unsuitable for use by an unskilled typist. Chemists have toiled countless 
hours in attempts to create a more permanent inking composition, with 
varying degrees of success. One way of overcoming this problem is to actually mold the desired 
indicia into the plastic. A technique known as 'double shot molding' 
forms the first part of the object in one color of plastic. The remainder of 
the part is then molded in a second step or shot in a contrasting color, 
such that the two contrasting color plastics are exposed on the surface of 
the part, creating the desired indicia. This solves the problem of wear 
and erosion, but is costly because each part must have a specifically 
designed mold, and the two shot molding process consumes more 
molding time, thus increasing the finished cost of the part. If unique or 
custom designs are required, this process is not a feasible solution. Other solutions are to cover the printed graphics by laminating a 
clear layer of plastic over the indicia. This also requires a secondary 
operation, and may not be suitable for all applications. It can require 
that the part be reheated, causing it to warp or distort. Another 
alternate technique is known as in-mold heat transfer decorating. In 
this process, two operations are performed simultaneously, thus 
eliminating the labor, time, and space required for secondary functions.  
 
Plastic parts are injection molded and decorated in one shot on the 
molding machine. The process uses a film or foil of gravure printed 
graphics. The graphics are preprinted and imbedded behind a layer of 
clear plastic. The film is registered in the proper position in the mold, 
the mold closes, and the plastic part is formed by conventional injection 
molding. During the
