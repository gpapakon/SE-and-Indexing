<ABSTRACT>
The system comprises two matrices (2, 2') with recessed surfaces (6, 6'), linked together by crenellated edges formed by interlocking teeth which allow the matrices to be brought together, e.g. by hydraulic pressure, closing the space between them. The two matrices are identical in shape and fitted by reversing one relative to the other so that the teeth interlock. Each matrix recess is in the shape of a portion of a cylinder, so that a cylinder is formed when they are brought together, squeezing a component placed between them. The matrix teeth can have chamfered or slightly rounded edges for ease of engagement.

<CLAIMS>
Set of two dies designed to be fitted to a press for
swaging and/or crimping a tubular metal part, the dies

(2, 2') each exhibiting a hollow imprint (6, 6') forming
a circular cylinder portion which is extended laterally

on each edge by a toothed die junction surface (7a, 7b)
such that said surfaces are designed to be imbricated in

one another at the time of the mutual translatory
movement of the dies (2, 2') towards one another produced

by the press, while the dimensions of the imprints and
the toothed surfaces (7a, 7b) are such that the two

completely imbricated dies form an internal surface of
substantially circular cylindrical general shape,

characterised in that the toothed surfaces (7a, 7b) of
each die each form a plurality of teeth and gaps, and

extend the hollow imprint (6) substantially tangential to
the latter, the planes containing the internal faces of

said teeth of one die intersecting with the corresponding
planes of the other die forming dihedral angles.
Set of two dies according to claim 1, characterised
in that the dimensions of the teeth of each die are

identical while the central axis (11, 11') of the
cylinder portion or imprint (6, 6') of each die is

determined by the intersection of the longitudinal plane
(10) of the die with the half-tooth dividing plane (9) of

said dies such that the substantially circular
cylindrical surface formed by the dies is obtained when

the teeth of one die are imbricated to the bottom of the
gaps of the other die. 
Set of two dies according to one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the two dies (2, 2') are identical

and in that their toothed surfaces (7a, 7b) are
constituted by a succession of teeth and gaps with the

same dimensions and delimited on one side by a tooth (8a,
8b) and on the other by a recess (8'a, 8'b) such that the

two dies (2, 2') are designed to face one another, but to
be turned one in relation to the other such that the

teeth of one fit in the gaps of the other.
Set of two dies according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the teeth are slightly chamfered or

rounded.
Set of two dies according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the bottom of each gap is slightly

chamfered or rounded (R) on its inner edge.
Manual hydraulic press comprising a set of two dies
(2, 2') according to one of claims 1 to 5, fitted in a

head (1), one (2') of the dies being immobilised while
the other die (2), fitted so as to be mobile, is moved by

the hydraulic jack of said press.
Use of a set of two dies according to one of claims
1 to 6, for effecting crimping by cold swaging of a

cylindrical ring (15) on a pipe (12) in which a connector
or end piece (13) provided with peripheral bosses is

disposed.
