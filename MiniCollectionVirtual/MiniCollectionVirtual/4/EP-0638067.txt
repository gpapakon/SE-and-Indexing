<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to novel propoxyphene derivatives which are synthesized for the covalent attachment to antigens (proteins or polypeptides) for the preparation of antibodies or receptors to propoxyphene and propoxyphene metabolites. The resulting novel antigens may be used for the production of antibodies or receptors using standard methods. Once generated, the antibodies or receptors and the novel derivatives which are covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or labels may be used in the immunoassay process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of ligand receptor
assays, including immunoassays, for the detection of
propoxyphene and selected metabolites of propoxyphene in
a fluid sample. More particularly, this invention relates
to methods for the synthesis of novel propoxyphene derivatives
and protein and polypeptide propoxyphene derivative
conjugates and labels for use in the preparation of
antibodies to propoxyphene metabolites and for use in the
immunoassay process.d-Propoxyphene is a narcotic analgesic, but unlike
morphine and codeine, it is much less addictive. However,
because of its narcotic effect, propoxyphene has become a
drug of abuse. Thus, the illicit and abusive use of
propoxyphene has resulted in a medical need for antibodies
and diagnostics to rapidly detect propoxyphene and
propoxyphene metabolites in order to monitor and treat
abuse.The preparation of antibodies to propoxyphene and
propoxyphene metabolites requires the synthesis of
propoxyphene derivatives in order to covalently attach the
derivative to an antigenic polypeptide or protein. In
addition, the propoxyphene derivative is covalently
attached to various polypeptides, proteins or labels for
use in screening antibodies and in the immunoassay
process. The propoxyphene derivative should mimic the
structure of the propoxyphene metabolites sought to be
measured. Therefore, the selection and synthesis of the 
types of propoxyphene derivatives for covalent attachment
to proteins, polypeptides or labels is critical. In
addition, the propoxyphene derivatives need to be stable
and soluble in an aqueous solution.US-A-4025501 discloses polypeptide propoxyphene
derivatives for immunoassay reagents. The propoxyphene
moiety is conjugated to a dibasic acid to form a half-acid
ester, which is then activated for conjugation to amine to
form amide linkages.The present invention is directed to novel
propoxyphene derivatives which are synthesized for the
covalent attachment to antigens (proteins or polypeptides)
for the preparation of antibodies to the propoxyphene
metabolites. The resulting novel antigens may be used for
the production of antibodies using standard methods. Once
generated, the antibodies and the novel derivatives which
are covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or
labels may be used in the immunoassay process.In accordance with the present invention and as used
herein, the following terms, are defined with the following
meanings, unless explicitly stated otherwise."Drug" shall mean any compound or ligand which either
