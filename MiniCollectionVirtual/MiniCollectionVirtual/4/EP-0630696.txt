<ABSTRACT>
A method for the gentle cooling of special and high-grade steel bars produced by hot rolling which are divided into shorter lengths following a mill train (1) and are decelerated by an approach channel (6) arranged ahead of a cooling bed (4) in the stock path provides for the bars to be divided into short lengths, collected into dense piles next to the approach channel and transferred in piles to a cross conveyor (11) operated at a high conveying speed and connected to a discharge roller table (5), and, in the course of being discharged on the discharge roller table (5), are cut into commercial lengths and then stored in insulated holding containers (16). The cross conveyor (11) is arranged next to the approach channel (6) and is designed as a hot bed (13).

Method for gently cooling down of special or high-grade steels which 
are hot-rolled into bars and which are divided into partial lengths at a 

roll train (1) and braked by an outlet channel (6) arranged in the material 
flow upstream of a cooling bed (4), characterised thereby that the bars 

are subdivided into shorter bar lengths as the usual part lengths, combined 
into tight bar layers near the outlet channel (6) and transferred layer-by-layer 

to a transverse conveyor (11), which is operated at high transport 
speed and connected to a delivery roll path (2), as well as cut into 

commercial lengths in the course of transport away on the delivery roll 
path (2) and subsequently stored in insulated heat-keeping containers (16). 
Device for carrying out the method according to claim 1, consisting 
of a cutting unit (3) which is arranged behind the roll train (1) and 

connected to an outlet channel (6) and a cooling bed (4), characterised 
thereby that a transverse conveyor (11) constructed as a thermal bed (13) 

is arranged near the outlet channel (6). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised by endless chains forming 
the transverse conveyor (11). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised by transport carriages 
forming the transverse conveyor (11). 
Device according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterised thereby that 
a collecting chute (14) is arranged between the outlet channel (6) and the 

transverse conveyor (11).
