<ABSTRACT>
A process for the recovery of dimethyl 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylate from residues of DMT preparation, in which the residues are first distilled under a pressure of at most 7 mbar at a still temperature of 200 to 350@C, the distillate distilling over at a pressure of, for example, 0.2 mbar in the range from 230 to 270@C is then treated for 10 to 60 minutes with 0.7 to 10 times the amount of an organic solvent at a temperature of 70 to 180@C, if necessary the clear solution is separated from undissolved constituents, the separated clear solution is cooled to a temperature of 45 to 65@C and allowed to crystallise at this temperature, a suspension of dimethyl 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylate crystals being obtained from which the crystals are isolated in a customary manner, washed one or more times with the same or another solvent and dried.

A process for isolating dimethyl 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylate 
from residues and secondary streams of DMT 

production, which comprises first distilling the 
residues or the material of the secondary streams at 

a pressure of at most 7 mbar at a boiler temperature 
from 200 to 350°C, subsequently treating the distillate 

(boiling range at a pressure of, for example, 
0.2 mbar from 230 to 270°C) for from 10 to 60 

minutes with from 0.7 to 10 times its weight of an 
organic solvent at a temperature from 70 to 180°C, 

if required separating the clear solution from 
undissolved components, cooling the removed clear 

solution to a temperature from 45 to 65°C and allowing 
it to crystallize at this temperature, which 

results in a suspension of dimethyl 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylate 
crystals from which the crystals are 

isolated by conventional means, washed once or, if 
desired, one or more times with the same or a 

different solvent, and are dried. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
organic solvent used is an alkanol having from 1 to 

8 carbon atoms. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
and 2, wherein the organic solvent used is methanol. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 3, wherein distillation is carried out at a  

 
boiler temperature from 200 to 310°C. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 4, wherein the distillate is treated with from 1 

to 5 times its amount of the organic solvent. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 5, wherein the treatment of the distillate with 

the organic solvent is carried out at from 70 to 
150°C.
