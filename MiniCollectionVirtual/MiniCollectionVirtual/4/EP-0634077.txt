<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to video projectors using pulsed
lasers for the light source. More specifically, it relates to
a single acoustic-optical modulator which produces full color
laser video projections.Video projectors employing lasers as a light source, and
more particularly, the use of acoustic-optical modulated pulsed
laser video projectors are known and described in U.S. Patent
4,720,747, issued January 19, 1988 and U.S. Patent 4,851,918,
issued July 25, 1989, both with Ronald P. Crowley. These
patents describe a video imaging system responsive to
electrical signals representing a video image and employ one or
more pulsed lasers, such as metal vapor lasers, to provide one
or more monochromatic light sources.A full color video projector is described employing three
separate pulsed lasers to provide light input beams of red,
green and blue into an anisotropic acoustic-optical cell with
three separate transducers mounted on the cell to produce three
separate, collinear, modulated light output beams which
produces a full color video image on a projection surface.It is desirable to provide a new and improved laser video
projector and method with electronic data multiplexing for an
all solid state, full color pulsed laser projector with no
moving parts.According to the present invention, there is provided:
a multiplexed, multicolored video imaging system for
displaying an input video signal, the system comprising:a light source comprising a plurality of pulsed lasers to
provide respective light beams of different frequency and light
mixing means to mix the respective light beams to provide a 
multi-chromatic input light beam;a single acoustic-optical cell for modulating the multi-chromatic
input light beam received on an inlet face and for
outputting a modulated output light beam from an outlet face;an electrical signal to sound wave transducer mounted on a
face of the acoustic-optical cell other than its inlet and
outlet faces;a projection surface; andplane projector means to project each line of the
modulated output light beam to a different physical location on
the projection surface; characterised by:compression means for compressing lines of the respective
components of the input video signal to a period less than the
horizontal scanning period of the input video signal divided by
the number of components thereof;electronic multiplexing means to provide a multiplexed
video signal comprising sequentially compressed lines of the
respective components of the input video signal; andsignal means to drive
