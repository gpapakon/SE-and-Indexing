<ABSTRACT>
A pen cap raising and lowering mechanism (20) for use in a pen plotter having a pen station for holding a pen (10) prior to use and a pen cap raising and lowering mechanism (20) for capping and uncapping a writing tip of the pen to allow a shipping cap (12) of a pen (10) to be employed within the pen plotter to cap and uncap the pen (10). There is pen cap raising and lowering apparatus carried by the pen plotter moving between a raised position and a lowered position to cap and uncap, respectively, a pen (10) operably located at the pen station. There are also gripping fingers (22) carried by the pen cap raising and lowering apparatus (20) for positioning, gripping and holding a shipping cap of a pen (10) when the pen (10) is initially inserted into the pen station and during use of the pen (10) and for releasing the shipping cap (12) in combination with the pen (10) when the pen is removed from the pen station for replacement. The pen cap raising and lowering apparatus (20) retains the gripping fingers (22) in the raised position when a pen (10) is initially inserted into the pen station and when the pen (10) is removed from the pen station for replacement. There is an adaptor cap (26) for using pens not provided with the shipping cap as well as an optional vent seal (38) to seal the pen against temperature and pressure change effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DUAL PURPOSE PEN CAPPING SYSTEM FOR PEN PLOTTERSBackground of the Invention: The present invention relates to pen plotters and, more particularly, to a pen cap raising and lowering mechanism for use in a pen plotter having a pen station for holding a pen prior to use and a pen cap raising and lowering mechanism for capping and uncapping a writing tip of the pen to allow a shipping cap of a pen to be employed within the pen plotter to cap and uncap the pen comprising, pen cap raising and lowering apparatus carried by the pen plotter moving between a raised position and a lowered position to cap and uncap, respectively, a pen operably located at the pen station; and, gripping fingers carried by the pen cap raising and lowering apparatus for positioning, gripping and holding a shipping cap of a pen when the pen is initially inserted into the pen station and during use of the pen and for releasing the shipping cap in combination with the pen when the pen is removed from the pen station for replacement; wherein, the pen cap raising and lowering apparatus retains the gripping fingers in the raised position when a pen is initially inserted into the pen station and when the pen is removed from the pen station for replacement.As depicted in Figures 1 through 4, in a typical prior art pen plotter, a pen 10 comes with a shipping cap 12 disposed over the drawing tip 14. As depicted in Figure 2, the shipping cap 12 is typically discarded and the pen 10 is mounted over a capping mechanism 16 which is part of the pen plotter. The capping mechanism 16 can be located at a pen station or on a turret holding multiple pens. When not in use, the pen 10 is positioned as shown 

 in Figure 3 with the capping mechanism 16 protecting the drawing tip 14 of the pen 10. When the pen is to be used, as shown in Figure 4, the capping mechanism 16 is lowered so that the drawing tip 14 will clear the capping mechanism 16 as the pen 10 is moved in the direction of the arrow 18 to a point of use on the pen plotter. Such integral pen-capping systems can be seen as for example in Patent 4,660,054 of Kajikawa, et al., 4,683,476 of Ferrari, et al. , 4,716,420 of Glassett and 4,982,208 of Farlotti.As the ink within the pen 10 is consumed, the pen 10 is discarded and a new pen 10 is positioned in the pen plotter to take its place. Unfortunately, the capping mechanism 16 is not replaced. Neither is there typically a procedure for cleaning the capping mechanism 16. Thus, over time, ink residue and airborne particles of dust, hair, and the like,
