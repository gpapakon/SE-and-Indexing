<ABSTRACT>
This apparatus comprises means for extracting at least the prefixed part of a text broadcasting information 
transmitted by use of the vertical blanking period of television signals; means for designating desired text information 

of the text information transmitted by the text broadcasting; means for separating only the desired text information 
according to the information recognized by the recognizing means; means for recording the desired text information 

thus separated; means for reproducing the recorded text information; and means for outputting the reproduced text 
information by inserting it into the given lines within the period of the vertical blanking.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
recording and reproducing apparatus for recording a
video signal and an audio signal and for enabling a
character broadcast program to be recorded.A character broadcast which can insert a
signal for character broadcast for a V blanking period
of time of a video signal and can reproduce character
data on the reception side has been put into practical
use. A character multiplex broadcast will now be
described hereinbelow.At present, a character broadcast signal is,
as shown in Fig. 1, multiplexed into total eight lines
of 14, 15, 16, 21 H (odd number fields) and 277, 278,
279, 284 H (even number fields) in the vertical
blanking period (VBL) of a TV signal and is
transmitted.One line comprises a data line (296 bits), in
which data of a clock run-in CR (16 bits) for obtaining
bit synchronization and a framing code FC (8 bits) for
obtaining byte synchronization and a check code (82 
bits) for error correction are included. When
eliminating them, a data amount per one H is equal to
190 bits.In the character multiplex broadcast, tens of
different programs are transmitted with respect to one
TV broadcasting channel. Generally, one character
broadcasting program comprises a plurality of pages.
Those programs are sent as by a batch type in which
whole data (all pages) of one program is transmitted in
a lump or a non-batch type in which the data is sent on
a page unit basis.One character broadcasting program needs data
of the unit of kilobyte (1 kilobyte = 8192 bits).
However, since only 190 bits can be stored per one line
as mentioned above, the data is sent by using a number
of lines.In the character multiplex broadcast, data of
one character broadcast program is sent by using same H
(horizontal period) line.In case of the batch type, data can be
transmitted for, for example, one second or shorter
even by using the same line. In case of the non-batch
type, however, since the data of the other character
broadcasting program is transmitted between pages, the
data of each page is sent once in a while.In this case, when the user designates a
program number which doesn't exist by using a remote 
controller or the like, there is no response for a long
time, so that there is a remarkable inconvenience.
Therefore, even in the non-batch type, data of one page
is certainly transmitted at an interval of 20 or 30
seconds, thereby preventing such an inconvenience. On
the other hand, it is recommended that program index
data of the line is also transmitted at the same
interval.Figs.

broadcasting signal is transmitted by using the same channel as that of said television

broadcast;
means (101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108) for reproducing the recorded
television broadcasting signal and character broadcasting signal; and
means (117, 151, 301, 303, 304, 305, 321, 322, 327) for inserting the reproduced
character broadcasting signal into a predetermined line in the vertical blanking period and

means (323) for outputting the signals,

characterized
