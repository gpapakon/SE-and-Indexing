<ABSTRACT>
Clones are disclosed comprising at least part of a DNA sequence of a gene encoding maize acetyl CoA carboxylase, or a sequence showing substantial homology therewith, flanked by heterologous DNA. DNA from such clones may be used to isolate similar sequences in other plants. Such sequences may be used to transform plants to give a variety of useful effects, including resistance to herbicides such as fluazifop, and modified oil-bearing properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MAIZE ACETYL CoA CARBOXYLASE ENCODING DNA CLONESThe present invention relates to novel DNA clones and uses thereof: including the use thereof to transform plants and genetically modified plants so obtained.Clones according to the present invention comprise at least part of a DNA sequence of a gene encoding maize acetyl CoA carboxylase, or a sequence showing substantial homology therewith, flanked by heterologous DNA.Acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-containing enzyme, catalyses the first step in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, namely the carboxylation of acetyl CoA to give malonyl CoA. Accordingly clones according to the invention have a number of uses, depending on their exact nature.For example, clones according to the invention containing partial coding sequences of an ACCase gene may be used to probe plant DNA (for example genomic DNA, or cDNA libraries prepared from messenger RNA) to obtain other clones according to the invention. These other clones may be different or longer; they may be substantially complete clones of the maize ACCase, or part or all of genes coding for corresponding or similar enzymes in maize or other plants (both monocots and dicots). Partial sequences according to the invention may be used (generally but not necessarily in reverse orientation) in combination with a regulator sequence functional in plants to construct an expression cassette. This expression cassette can then be used to transform plants to down-regulate the production of ACCase enzyme. This can alter the composition of seed or other plant parts, for example enabling oil-bearing plants (oilseed rape, sunflower, oilpal ) having a lower or otherwise modified oil content to be produced. Clones containing longer or substantially complete 

 sequences of an ACCase gene may also be used to form similar expression cassettes. Such coding sequences may be used in plants (either by using more powerful promoters or by inserting extra copies of the gene) to promote the expression or overexpression of ACCase, for example leading to plants with an enhanced oil content.Partial clones according to the invention can be used to probe plant DNA to recover the promoter of the ACCase gene. This promoter may then be used to generate RNA in a tissue-specific or developmentally-regulated fashion. The RNA so generated may inhibit expression of ACCase, or another gene; or be mRNA that generates ACCase, or another protein.In onocotyledonous plants the ACCase enzyme is inhibited by certain classes of grass-weed herbicides

CLAIMS
We claim:
1. A DNA clone comprising at least part of a DNA sequence of a gene encoding a plant acetyl CoA carboxylase, or a sequence showing substantial homology therewith, flanked by heterologous DNA.
2. A clone as claimed in claim 1 in which the plant is a monocot, eg maize or barley.
3. A clone as claimed in claim 1 in which the plant is a dicot, eg Arabidopsis.
4. A clone as claimed in any of claims 1-3 in which the DNA sequence encoding the plant acetyl CoA carboxylase is substantially complete.
5. A clone as claimed in any of claims 1-4 which further comprises a promoter sequence functional in plants for expressing RNA from the DNA sequence.
6. A clone as claimed in claim 5 in which the promoter sequence is inducible.
7. A clone as claimed in any of claims 1-4 which comprises a promoter for a plant acetyl CoA carboxylase gene.
8. A clone as claimed in either of claims 6 or 7 in which the promoter is from an acetyl CoA carboxylase gene of a dicotyledonous plant. 


 9. A clone as claimed in any of claims 1-3 or 5-8 which comprises part only of a DNA sequence encoding plant acetyl CoA carboxylase.
10. A clone as claimed in claims 5 and 9 in which the DNA sequence of the plant acetyl CoA carboxylase is inverted with respect to the promoter, so as to produce in plants RNA complementary to mRNA for the enzyme ACCase.
11. A process for producing novel plants which comprises transforming plant cells with clones claimed in any of claims 5 to 8 or 10.
12 Plants produced by the process of claim 11.
13. Plants as claimed in claim 12 which have modified oil-producing properties as a result of underexpressing the enzyme ACCase.
14. Plants as claimed in claim 12 which express recombinant ACCase.
15 Monocotyledonous plants as claimed in claim 14 which show increased tolerance to herbicides interfering with the fatty acid synthesis pathway.
16. Plants as claimed in claim 15 which express recombinant dicot ACCase.
17. A process for isolating clones claimed in claim 1 which comprises extracting ACCase from plant material, purifying it, preparing antibodies thereto by challenging a mammalian immune system therewith, immuno-purifying the antibodies and using them to select clones from a plant DNA library. 


18. Clones A3 and A4 prepared by the process of claim 17 and deposited at the Australian Government Analytical Laboratory under the designations maize A3 ACC cDNA plasmid and maize A4 ACC cDNA plasmid, respectively.
19. Process for the preparation of clones as claimed in claim 1 which comprises reproducing clones claimed in claim 1, their relatives or descendants.
20. Process for obtaining a clone as claimed in claim 3 which comprises probing a dicot DNA library with a clone as claimed in claim 2.
21. A clone as claimed in claim 4 which further comprises a promoter sequence functional in micro-organisms for expressing RNA from the DNA sequence.
22. A micro-organism which is host to a clone claimed in claim 21.
23. A process for screening a chemical compound for herbicidal activity which comprises culturing of a microÂ¬ organism claimed in claim 22 under conditions capable of producing ACCase, treating the culture with the chemical compound to be screened and comparing the quantity or activity of ACCase thereafter produced with that obtained from similar untreated cultures.
24. ACCase produced by culture of a microorganism claimed in claim 22.
