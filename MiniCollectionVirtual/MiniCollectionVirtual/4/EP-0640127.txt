<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are improved methods for treating cotton-containing fabrics as well as the fabrics produced from these methods. In particular, the disclosed methods are directed to contacting cotton-containing fabrics with an aqueous solution containing a fungal cellulase composition which comprises CBH I type components and one or more EG type components wherein said cellulase composition has a protein weight ratio of CBH I type components to all EG type components of greater than 10:1. Cotton-containing fabrics so treated possess decreased strength loss as compared to fabrics treated with a complete cellulase composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR TREATING COTTON-CONTAINING FABRICS WITH CBH I ENRICHED CELLULASEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention is directed to improved methods for treating cotton-containing fabrics with cellulase as well as to the fabrics produced from these methods. In particular, the improved methods of the present invention are directed to contacting cotton-containing fabrics with an aqueous solution containing a fungal cellulase composition which comprises a combination of exo-cellobiohydrolase I type components and endoglucanase components wherein the exo- cellobiohÎ³drolase I type components are enriched relative to the endoglucanase type components. When the cotton-containing fabric is treated with such solutions, the resulting fabric possesses the expected enhancements in, for example, feel, appearance, and/or softening, etc., as compared to the fabric prior to treatment and the fabric also possesses reduced strength loss as compared to the fabric treated with a complete cellulase composition.State of the ArtDuring or shortly after their manufacture, cotton-containing fabrics can be treated with cellulase in order to impart desirable properties to the fabric. For example, in the textile industry, cellulase 

has been used to improve the feel and/or appearance of cotton- containing fabrics, to remove surface fibers from cotton-containing knits, for imparting a stone washed appearance to cotton-containing denims and the like.In particular, Japanese Patent Application Nos. 58-362 7 and58-54032, as well as Ohishi et al., "Reformation of Cotton Fabric by Cellulase", and JTN December 1988 journal article "What's New - Weight Loss Treatment to Soften the Touch of Cotton Fabric" each disclose that treatment of cotton-containing fabrics with cellulase results in an improved feel for the fabric. It is generally believed that this cellulase treatment removes cotton fuzzing and/or surface fibers which reduces the weight of the fabric. The combination of these effects imparts improved feel to the fabric, i.e., the fabric feels more like silk.Additionally, it was heretofore known in the art to treat cotton- containing knitted fabrics with a cellulase solution under agitation and cascading conditions, for example, by use of a jet, for the purpose of removing broken fibers and threads common to these knitted fabrics. When so treated, buffers are generally not employed because they are believed to adversely affect dye shading with selected dyes.It was still further heretofore known in the art
