<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a smectic C liquid crystal
compound and its composition. More particularly, it relates
to a smectic C liquid crystal compound and its composition
and a ferroelectric smectic C liquid crystal composition
using the same and further a light-switching element using
the composition.Liquid crystal composition have been broadly used
as a display element material. Most of the current liquid
crystal display elements are those of TN type display mode,
and this display mode utilizes nematic phase.The TN type display mode used for the liquid crystal
display is roughly classified into two modes. One mode
is an active matrix mode having switching elements fixed
to the respective pixels. An example of this mode is a
mode using a thin film transistor (TFT). The display grade
has reached a level matching with that of CRT (cathod ray
tube), but it is difficult to bring the picture surface
into a large scale and the cost therefor is high.Another mode is STN (super twisted) mode. The contrast
and the visual sensation-dependency have been improved 
as compared with those of conventional simple matrix mode,
but the display grade has not yet reached the level of
CRT, but its cost is cheap. These two modes have a merit
and a demerit when its grade and production cost are taken
into consideration.A mode expected ten years ago to solve the two problems
is a mode of ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC). At
present, what is merely called FLC, refers to a surface-stabilized
ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC). This
SSFLC was proposed by A. Clark and S.T. Lagerwall (see
Applied physics letters, 36, 899, 1980). Since then, it
has been called a liquid crystal of the next generation,
and its commercialization has been tried by appliance makers
and material makers, as well as improvement of the
characteristics and commercialization have been made.Because, ferroelectric liquid crystal elements are
provided with the following characteristics in principle:
(1) high speed response properties,(2) good memory properties, and(3) broad viewing angle.The above characteristics suggest a possibility of
SSFLC into a large capacity display and have made SSFLC
very attractive.However, as the research has been advanced, problems
to be solved have been clarified.Among the problems, a stabilized exhibition of memory
is the first problem. As the causes of the difficulty 
in the stabilized exhibition of memory, non-uniformity
of smectic layer structure (for example, twisted alignment,
chevron structure) and occurrence of the
