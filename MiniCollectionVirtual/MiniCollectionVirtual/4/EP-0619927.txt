<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a time division multiple
access (TDMA) trunked radio system and it relates to a frame
structure for communication between fixed, mobile and
portable radios in such a system.Currently proposed spectrally efficient radio systems
such as the proposed European standard for digital trunked
radios require highly linear power amplifiers to minimize the
transmission of modulation products or "splatter" on adjacent
channels. A technique for achieving the necessary linearity
performance in power amplifiers involves the use of a
linearization training sequence such as is described in US
patent No. 5066923 of Motorola Inc.A problem with this method of linearizing of power
amplifiers is that a finite amount of time needs to be
allocated for the training sequence to be transmitted. In
time division multiple access systems, the allocating of a
finite amount of air time for training is a particularly
costly overhead which reduces overall system throughput.One method for avoiding the need to allocate excessive
air time for training is described in GB 2265269 of Motorola
Limited. In the arrangement described in that patent
application, training is achieved off-air by use of a
circulator and an antenna switch and a load, in which the
training sequence is transmitted into the load by selective
operation of the antenna switch.There is a perceived need in the art for a manner of
achieving linearization of the power amplifier without the
use of substantial additional hardware and with a minimum of
air time being allocated for training. Other requirements
that need to be addressed are a minimum delay between a
requirement to transmit and the achievement of linearity
prior to transmission and/or the minimisation of 
transmissions while not fully linearized to an acceptably low
percentage of all transmissions.According to the present invention, a radio system is
provided comprising a base station and a plurality of remote
radio units for communicating over time slots of a time
divided radio channel, the base station having means for
transmitting a synchronization signal for defining the timing
of the time slots, and each of the remote units having a
power amplifier with linearization means, characterized in
that the channel comprises predetermined linearization time
slots for transmission of linearization training signals,
interspersed between other time slots and each remote radio
unit comprises means for generating a linearization training
signal during a linearization time slot and linearizing its
pow
