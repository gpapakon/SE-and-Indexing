Heald shaft coupling, comprising a first shaft-side coupling part (5) with at least one
coupling surface (13, 13a) and a second drive-side coupling part (11), with a pawl (14),

movable against the first coupling part (5) and connectible thereto, the pawl (14) being
arranged in the coupling part (11) so that it can pivot about an axis (19) and having at least

one counter-coupling surface (14a), 
characterised in that
, in the second coupling part (11)
and at a distance from the axis (19) on the pawl (14), a triangular lever (25), biased by a

tension spring (22), and part of a joint mechanism (20), acts at a pivot point (23), in that the
triangular lever (25) is connected to a first lever arm (28a) of a bell crank lever (28) which

is supported in the second coupling part (11) so that it can pivot about an axis (27), and the
second lever arm (28b) of which can be brought into operative connection with a device

(31) for the simultaneous opening and closing of the heald shaft coupling (5,11), the second
coupling part (11) having a locating element (18) which is opposite the pawl (14) and has a

bearing surface (18a) running parallel to the longitudinal axis (6) of the shaft coupling
(5,11).
Heald shaft coupling according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the shaft-side coupling
part (5) is rotatably accommodated by a support shaft (4) in a support (1) which is formed

similarly to a bearing block and connected to the heald shaft (3).
Heald shaft coupling according to claim 1 and 2, 
characterised in that
 the coupling part
(5) has a first pawl-side flank, which is displaced into the coupling part (5) in the nature of

a recess, thereby forming a bearing surface (13) and a support surface (13a), and has a
second flank which forms a bearing surface (12) parallel to the longitudinal axis (6) of the

coupling part (5).
Heald shaft coupling according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the joint mechanism
(20) comprises a triangular lever (25), which acts on the pawl (14) in an articulated manner 

and has a pivot point (23,24,26) in each corner region, the pivot point (26) and the pawl-side
pivot point (23) lying on a straight line, and the pivot point (26) having an axial shaft

(26a) passing through it, on which the one lever arm (28a) of the bell crank lever (28) acts,
the bell crank lever (28) being pivotable about an axial shaft (27) supported in the bearing

bodies (16,17), and the other lever arm (28b) of the bell crank lever (28) being the point of
action for an actuating element (31b) of an actuating device (31)
Heald shaft coupling according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the second coupling
part (11) is fixed to the push rod (15) of the shaft drive.
Device for the simultaneous opening and closing of a plurality of heald shaft couplings
(5,11) positioned p
arallel to one another and having the features of claim 1, 
characterised
by
 a control shaft (31a) and an actuating element (31b) assigned to each drive-side shaft
coupling part (11) and mounted so that it cannot rotate on the rotationally driven control

shaft (31a), the control shaft (31a) simultaneously bringing all actuating elements (31b) into
operative connection with the respective bell crank lever (28), and the rotationally driven

control shaft (31a) extending over the entire number of individual shafts transversely to
their stroke.
Device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the actuating elements (31b) are
designed in the nature of a tension lever with a curved path (33) with periphery, on which

curved path (33) a roller (30) connected to the bell crank lever (28) is guided.
