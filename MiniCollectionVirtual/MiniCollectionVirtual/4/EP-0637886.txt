<ABSTRACT>
Halftone screens are generated for each separation in accordance with the goal of 
avoiding overlapping whenever possible. Initially, the black separation 

(K) is halftoned, 
generating a dot with a number of ON pixels and OFF pixels in accordance with the area 

density of the black separation. Next, a first color separation (C) 
is halftoned, setting a number of 

the previous OFF pixels to ON. Then, if any white pixels remain, the 
second color separation (M) is 

halftoned, setting a number of the previously OFF pixels to ON. After the second color 
separation is halftoned, if any OFF pixels remain, the third color separation 

(Y) is halftoned, 
setting a number of the previous OFF pixels to ON. If during the processing 

of the second and 
third separations, it is determined that no OFF pixels exist to be turned ON, 

second and third 
layers of color is started, respectively superimposed over the first layer and 

then, if required, 
superimposed over the second layer. Each layer is started and arranged so that 

the additional colors forming the dot are not placed on any black areas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing a color image, and more particularly
to binarization of multiple separation contone color images.Printers commonly provide a limited number of output possibilities, and are
commonly binary, i.e., they produce either a spot or no spot at a given location (although
multilevel printers beyond binary are known). Thus, given a color separation with 256 shades
of each additive primary color, a set of binary printer signals must be produced representing
the contone effect. In such arrangements, over a given area in the separation having a number
of contone pixels therein, each pixel value of an array of contone pixels within the area is
compared to one of a set of preselected thresholds (the thresholds are stored as a dither matrix
and the repetitive pattern generated by this matrix is considered a halftone cell) as taught, for
example, in US-A 4,149,194 to Holladay. The effect of such an arrangement is that, for an area
where the image is a contone, some of the thresholds within the dither matrix will be
exceeded, i.e. the image value at that specific location is larger than the value stored in the
dither matrix for that same location, while others are not. In the binary case, the pixels or cell
elements for which the thresholds are exceeded might be printed as black, while the remaining
elements are allowed to remain white, dependent on the actual physical quantity described by
the data.Thus, it can be seen that several spots together form a halftone dot. These dots are
carefully designed to system requirements, so that the system optimally reproduces the image.
In electrophotographic systems, which have great difficulty in reproducing isolated spots (e.g. a
black spot surrounded by white spots), the dot is designed so that increasing densities produce
an increasing number of black spots clustered together. By contrast, ink jet printing produces
isolated dots reasonably well, and so the requirement of clustering can be relaxed in favor of
other requirements.In electrophotographic systems, with the clustered dot requirement, registration
between separations is difficult to achieve. Accordingly, since minor registration errors would
result in the development of undesirable moire patterns, the screens of each separation are
rotated with respect to other another, as in the above described reference to Holladay. In
current ink jet printers which have very good separation to separation registration, moire
patterns are not a problem. Accordingly, the dots can be
