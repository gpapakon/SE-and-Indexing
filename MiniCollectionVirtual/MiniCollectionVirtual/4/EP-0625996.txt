<ABSTRACT>
A crosslinked polyethylene or polypropylene glycol containing polymer which has a unique spatial structure and can be designed especially for application as a chromatographic resin or as a solid support for the synthesis of peptides, oligonucleotides or oligosaccharides or as a substrate for the immobilization of proteins. The polymer is formed by radical copolymerization of derivatized polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol bis-end substituted with a moiety selected from the group consisting of acryloylalkyl, acryloylaryl, acrylamidoalkyl and acrylamidoaryl with an acrylic amide, nitrile or ester. When it is to be used as a solid support or immobilization substrate, the polymer will incorporate a spacer comprising functional groups for the attachment of peptides, proteins, nucleotides or saccharides such as those selected from the group consisting of amino, alkylamino, hydroxy, carboxyl, mercapto, sulfeno, sulfino, sulfo and derivatives thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a crosslinked polyethylene glycol or 
polypropylene glycol containing polymer which has a unique 
spatial structure and can be designed especially for application 
as a chromatographic resin or as a solid support for 
the immobilization of proteins or for the synthesis of peptides, 
oligonucleotides or oligosaccharides. When solid phase peptide synthesis was first introduced by 
Bruce Merrifield1 it was performed on a support of 2% cross 
linked polystyrene allowing the preparation of a pentapeptide 
by a batchwise synthesis protocol. This invention formed the 
basis of a technique, which has since been subjected to 
continuous refinement. With the synthesis of longer peptides 
it soon became apparent that the cross linking of the resin 
had to be optimized. The best results were obtained with the 
1% cross linked resin still used in the batch synthesis 
today2. A more polar dimethyl acrylamide resin suitable for 
peptide synthesis in polar solvents like DMF was developed 
in Sheppards laboratory3. With the introduction of Fmoc-based solid phase synthesis4,5 
the much more efficient continuous flow process became a 
realistic alternative to the batch method. The available 
batch resins were however not flow stable and collapsed 
after a few synthesis cycles. It was well established that 
increased cross linking while increasing the stability of 
the resin would not lead to useful properties for peptide 
synthesis. The first flow stable synthesis resin was 
obtained by polymerization of the soft polydimethyl acrylamide 
gel inside a solid matrix of supporting kieselguhr6. 
This ingenious invention allowed the packing of columns, 
which were completely flow stable throughout the synthesis.  
 
The principle was refined by replacing the irregular 
kieselguhr with a more regular rigid 50% cross linked 
polystyrene sponge containing a grafted polydimethyl 
acrylamide gel7. At the same time a technique was developed for grafting 
polyethylene glycol on to a 1% crosslinked polystyrene8. The 
resulting resins were monodisperse, spherical and, more 
importantly, flow stable. A more controlled grafting by 
direct substitution of the functional groups in the polystyrene 
with modified polyethylene glycol carrying an 
amino group has also been described9. Polystyrene grafted to 
films of polyethylene has been used for synthesis of 
peptides under nonpolar conditions10 and polyhydroxypropyl 
acrylate coated polypropylene11 and the natural polymer, 
cotton, has shown some promise as supports
