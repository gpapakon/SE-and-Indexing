<ABSTRACT>
Firstly, a sheet (40) of flexible plastic having a low coefficient of friction is placed between the springy terminals (18) of the connector (12). Next, the edge (14) of the board (10), having connection areas between its two parts (40a, 40b) is inserted until the areas are opposite the active parts of the terminals. Finally, a traction force is exerted on a free edge of the sheet (40) in order to extract it. As a variant, the sheet (40) may be initially placed on the printed-circuit board (40), the assembly being inserted between the two series of terminals.

Method for inserting a printed board, comprising at 
least one row of connection regions arranged at the 

edge of the board, into a connector comprising at least 
one corresponding row of resilient contact terminals 

and support means located facing the contact terminals 
and separated from the latter by a distance less than 

the thickness of said board, is characterised in that 
it comprises the following steps: 


introducing between said resilient terminals (18) and 
said support means, a single sheet (40) of flexible 

material with a low coefficient of friction and the 
edge of the board comprising the connection regions 

(16) in such a way that said connection regions face 
the active part of the resilient terminals and that 

said sheet covers the section (14) of the board (10) 
and that a first part of the sheet is arranged between 

said resilient terminals and the face of the board 
comprising the connection regions and that a part of 

the sheet is interposed between said support means and 
the other face of said board; and 
exerting traction on the free end of one of the parts 
of said sheet in such a way that the second part (40b) 

of the sheet slides over the edge (14) of said board 
until no part of said sheet is any longer arranged 

between said board (10) and said resilient terminals 
(18). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that, at 
a first stage, said sheet (40c) is placed folded 

between said resilient terminals and said support means 
in such a way that the two free ends of the sheet are 

outside the connector and that the first part of the 
sheet is in contact with said terminals and that the 

second part of the sheet is in contact with said 
support means and, at a second stage, the edge (14) of  

 
the board (10) is introduced between said first and 

second parts of the sheet until said connection regions 
(16) are facing the active parts of said resilient 

terminals (18). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that, at 
a first stage, the single sheet (40) of a flexible 

material with a low coefficient of friction is arranged 
in such a way that said sheet covers the edge (14) of 

said board and that a first part (40a) of the sheet 
covers at least the part of the face (10a) of the board 

comprising the connection regions and that another part 
(40b) of said sheet covers at least part of the other 

face (10b) of said board, each of said parts having a 
free edge (43, 44); and, at a second stage, the edge 

(14) of said board covered by said sheet is introduced 
between said resilient terminals (18) and said support 

means until said connection regions are facing the 
active parts of said resilient terminals. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, for the 
insertion of a printed circuit board, comprising at the 

edge of each of its faces a row of connection regions, 
into a connector comprising two rows of resilient 

terminals arranged facing each other, characterised in 
that said second part covers the connection terminals 

of the second face of the circuit. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that said sheet is made of a 

transparent plastic material. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the part of said flexible sheet 

on which traction is exerted has a length in its 
direction perpendicular to the edge of the board that 

is greater than that of the other part of the sheet.
