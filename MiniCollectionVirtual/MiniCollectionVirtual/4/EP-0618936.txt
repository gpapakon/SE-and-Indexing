radical, 
Ar
2
 denotes a 
1,2,4-benzenetriyl
 trivalent 
radical and 
b) as sole solvent, substantially anhydrous 
gamma-butyrolactone free from butyl alcohol. 
Solutions according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the final concentration of polyamideimide is between 

5 and 35 %. 
Solutions according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that Ar
1
 denotes a mixture of 2,4-tolylene and 2,6-tolylene 
radicals in a proportion of at least 60 % of 

2,4-tolylene.

Process for obtaining clear solutions according 
to Claim 1, characterized in that the polycondensation is 

performed in substantially anhydrous γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) 
free from butyl alcohol as polycondensation solvent,  

 
in substantially stoichiometric proportions, between: 


tolylene diisocyanate, and 
an aromatic acid anhydride of which at least 
95 % is trimellitic anhydride, the concentration of 

polyamideimide in the γ-BL before dilution being at least 
27 %, and dilution is then performed with the same 

solvent to obtain a concentration of polyamideimide 
permitting the subsequent processing. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the to
lylene diisocyanate is in the form of a 
mixture of 2,4-tolylene and 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate 

containing at least 60 % of 2,4-tolylene diisocyanate. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the aromatic acid anhydride employed is trimellitic 

anhydride. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the concentration of polyamideimide before dilution 

is between 27 and 50 %. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the final concentration of polyamideimide is between 

5 and 30 %.
