<CLAIMS>
Flame-retardant, transparent copolyamides having a VO qualification according to UL-94
(test bars 0.8 mm in thickness) in which the monomers of said copolyamides are selected

from the group consisting of hexamethylene alkyl derivatives and cycloaliphatic diamines
having 7 to 22 C atoms, in combination with monomers of the group of aliphatic

dicarboxylic acids having 4 to 12 C atoms, cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids having 8 to
24 C atoms and aromatic dicarboxylic acids having 8 to 20 C atoms, or are copolyamides

selected from the group consisting of PA 12 PA 12 MACMI, PA 12 MACMI, PA 12
MACMT, PA 12 MACMI MACMT, PA 6I 6T, PA 12 MACM36, PA NDT INDT, PA

NDI INDI, PA 6I 6T MACMI, PA 12 6T, PA 6I MACMT and PA MACMI MACMX
in which the copolyamides as a flame-retardant additive contain at least one

alkylphosphonic acid compound dissolved in the polyamide which has the general
formula I



where each of R and R' is, independently of each other, a C
1
 to C
4
 alkyl residue and x = 0
or 1,

in amounts of 4 to 40 per cent by weight.
The copolyamides as claimed in Claim 1 in which the hexamethylene alkyl derivatives are
selected from the group consisting of 1,6-diamino-2,2',4-trimethylhexane and 1,6-diamino-2,4,4'-trimethylhexane.
The copolyamides as claimed in Claim 1 in which the cycloaliphatic diamines are selected
from the group consisting of bis-(p-aminocyclohexyl)methane, 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexylmethane,

4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexyl-2,2'-propane, 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl
cyclohexylamine. 
The copolyamides as claimed in Claim 1 in which R' in formula I is a C
2
H
5
 residue.
The copolyamides as claimed in Claim 1 in which R in formula I is a CH
3
 residue.
The copolyamides as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which they contain the
alkylphosphonic acid compound in an amount of 4 to 10 per cent by weight to achieve the

VO qualification according to UL-94.
The copolyamides as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which they contain as
the flame-retardant additive the trimethylolpropane ester of a methylphosphonic acid or

methylphosphonic acid-bis-[(5-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane-5-yl)
methyl]
ester-P-P'-dioxide.
Flame-retardant moulding materials or moulded articles having the VO qualification
according to UL-94 which can be made from the transparent copolyamides as claimed in

any one of Claims 1 to 7.
Flame-retardant moulding materials or moulded articles having the VO qualification
according to UL-94 which can be made from a blend of the transparent copolyamides as

claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7 and other polymers selected from the group consisting
of PET, PBT, PC, PVC, PVA, PU, PE, PP, PPS in which the blends may be modified with

additives selected from the group consisting of impact-strength modifiers, softeners,

stabilizers, reinforcing agents, pigments, colouring substances, and fillers.
Use of the copolyamides as claimed in Claims 1 to 7 for the manufacture of flame-retardant
threads, cables, plugs, and boards/plates having the VO qualification according

to UL-94.
