<ABSTRACT>
A method of sterilizing a liquid milk based 
product comprises indirect preheating of the product and 

final heating to a sterilization temperature 140-150°C 
by direct steam injection. The product is cooled by so 

called flash-cooling at which steam corresponding to the 
added amount of steam is evaporated and the product is 

further cooled by indirect cooling. It is now proposed 
that the product prior to the flash-cooling is cooled 

from the sterilization temperature of 140-150°C to a 
temperature in the range 90-120°C in an indirect, first 

cooling step after which the product is cooled by flash-cooling 
to a temperature of 70-85°C. 
The arrangement for sterilization comprises a 
balance vessel (1) connected to an indirectly working 

first heat exchanger (4) for heating of the milk based 
product. A steam injection nozzle (6) is arranged in a 

pipeline leading from the heat exchanger (4). After the 
steam injection nozzle (6) there is a holding section 

(8) and a vacuum vessel (10) in which the product is 

cooled by flash-cooling. A further indirectly working 
heat exchanger (9) for cooling of the product is 

connected between the holding section (8) and the vacuum 
vessel (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
continuous sterilization of a liquid milk based product 
and an arrangement for carrying through this method. 
The product is preheated by indirect heating and is then 
heated to a sterilization temperature of 140-150°C by 
means of injection of steam directly into a flow of the 
product. After sterilization the product is cooled by 
so called flash-cooling, during which water vapour 
corresponding to the added amount of steam is evaporated 
and the product is cooled by indirect cooling. By injecting the steam directly into the product 
there is obtained a very rapid heating up to 
sterilization temperature. Continuous processes with 
direct steam injection in milk, known as UHT-treatment, 
were presented in the beginning of the 1960's and are 
described for example in SE 218 503 (GB 937 782). UHT 
means Ultra High Temperature. As a consequence of the energy crisis in the 
1970's indirect processes for UHT treatments were 
proposed. In the indirect processes a large amount of 
the added heat energy may be recovered, whereas with the 
direct processes the heat energy which is added to the 
milk when the heating media is injected as steam is lost 
during the flash cooling. The direct heating of the milk to sterilization  
 
temperature followed by flashing may be carried through 
so rapidly that the holding time at sterilization 
temperature can be only a few seconds but the 
bacteriological effect obtained is still sufficient. 
Indirect sterilization is necessarily slower and the 
time that the milk is kept at a temperature above 120°C 
is considerably longer. The longer time the milk is 
kept at such a high temperature the greater the damage 
to the different components in the milk. A strong heat 
treatment results in high lactulose values, which is 
considered to be a measure of the damage to the milk and 
indicates a lower milk quality. The interest in direct UHT-processes has now 
increased again partly because some highly resistant 
bacteria spores have been found in the milk delivered to 
dairies periodically, but also because it is desirable 
to achieve not only a sterile but also high quality 
sterilized products. According to the invention there is now proposed 
a new way of carrying through the sterilization 
treatment which gives a better quality of the treated 
products, i.e. low formation of lactulose, but still a 
good operation economy for the sterilization. The method according to the invention is mainly 
characterised in that the milk based
