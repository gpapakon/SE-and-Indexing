<ABSTRACT>
A container (10) for the storage of perishable foodstuffs is chilled by means of a 
liquefied gas comprising a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen which when totally 

vaporised has an oxygen concentration of between 15 and 22%, the remaining 
concentration being substantially of nitrogen. such an atmosphere is breathable, 

and hence avoids the problems associated with non breathable chilling 
atmospheres.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the storage of perishable foodstuffs and relates 
particularly, but not exclusively, to the generation and use of cryogenic 
atmospheres for said storage. Presently know cryogenic storage arrangements comprise a source of liquid 
nitrogen which, in operation, is introduced in a vaporised or liquid state into a 
container in which perishable foodstuff is stored. The liquid/vapour acts to chill 
the contents of the container and is used in conjunction with a suitable control 
circuit to maintain the foodstuff within an acceptable temperature range during 
storage, transportation or freezing. One of the problems associated with the use of nitrogen to generate a chilling 
atmosphere resides in its non breathable nature. Operators can only enter the 
container after the introduction of oxygen therein often by opening the doors 
and waiting several minutes so that air penetrates the container or after donning 
a breathing apparatus. Clearly, both these steps are inconvenient, time 
consuming and can be expensive. If an operator enters the container without 
firstly implementing one of the safety steps, he is likely to be overcome by the 
lack of oxygen and could die if he is not quickly removed to a normal 
atmosphere. Other cryogenic storage arrangements are known in which a combination of 
liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen are used to create a cold 'breathable' 
atmosphere within a storage container. Such systems, however, require the use 
of two separate storage tanks and the provision of separate metering and 
control systems so as to ensure the oxygen content within the container 
remains sufficiently high as to enable an operator to survive therein and also 
sufficiently low as to ensure it does not create a fire hazard.  It is an object of the present invention to provide a safe cryogenic gas and an 
apparatus for dispensing the same which reduces and possibly overcomes the 
problems associated with the above mentioned arrangements. Accordingly, the present invention provides a liquefied gas for use in 
temperature control, the liquefied gas comprising a combined mixture of 
liquefied oxygen and nitrogen for storage in the same container, said liquefied 
gas when totally vaporised having an oxygen concentration of between 15% 
and 22% by volume, the remaining concentration being substantially of 
nitrogen. Preferably, the liquefied gas, when totally vaporised, has an oxygen 
concentration of between 16 percent and 21 percent by volume. In a particularly advantageous

having an oxygen concentration of between 15% and 22% by volume, 

the remaining concentration being substantially of nitrogen. 
A liquefied gas as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that said gas when 
totally vaporised, has an oxygen concentration of between 16 percent 

and 21 percent by volume. 
A liquefied gas as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that, when stored in 
liquid form, said gas comprises substantially 15 percent oxygen by 

volume which when fully vaporised has an oxygen concentration of 
substantially 18 percent by volume. 
A gas as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised in that 
said gas is used in temperature control of perishable food products.

configured for the storage, or temporary containment of, perishable 

foodstuffs for freezing or chilling thereof. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7 characterised by 
atmospheric control means comprising an oxygen monitor for monitoring 

the oxygen concentration in gaseous form and means for ceasing 
operation of said apparatus or warning an operator should the oxygen 

concentration fall below or rise above a pre-determined level.
