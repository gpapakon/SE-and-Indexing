<ABSTRACT>
The sealing capacity of a sealing ring, which is V-shaped in elongate form and is intended for plug-in socket connections, with respect to internal pressure is improved in that there is integrally formed on the axially interior and at least essentially radially positioned ring lip (5) of the sealing lip ring, a third sealing lip ring (8) which is of an at least essentially cylindrical design and is aligned coaxially with respect to the socket axis (9). Once the spigot (13) has been pushed in and the V-shaped sealing ring has been applied, a lip configuration which has an increasingly self-sealing action due to expansion as the internal pressure rises is achieved between the radical lip (7) and the cylindrical sealing lip (8) which is directed towards the inside of the socket. By designing an anchoring ring groove (2) in the socket (4) and a retaining sleeve (1) on the sealing ring with complementary shaping, the axial fixing of the sealing ring is improved.
