<DESCRIPTION>
 TRIAZINE DERIVATIVES FOR ENHANCING ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY Background of the Invention This invention relates to 2,4,6 tria inotriazines and their use as sensitizers of tumor cells to anticancer agents.In cancer chemotherapy the effectiveness of anticancer drugs is often limited by the resistance of tumor cells. Some tumors such as of the colon, pancreas, kidney and liver are generally innately resistant, and other responding tumors often develop resistance during the course of chemotherapy. The phenomena of multidrug resistance (MDR) is characterized by the tumor cell's cross-resistance to target of resistance include adriamycin, daunomycin, vinblastine, vincristine, daxol, actinomycin D and etoposide. The resistance cells are often associated with overexpression of the mdrl gene. This gene product is a family of 140-220 kd trans-membrane phosphoglycoprotein (P-glycoprotein) which functions as an ATP-dependent efflux pump. Thus, it has been postulated that this efflux mechanism keeps the intracellular level of the anticancer drug low, allowing the tumor cells to survive.In recent years various substances such as verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem have been used in vitro experimental systems to reverse the MDR phenomena. More recently some of these agents have been tested clinically as MDR reversing agents. Little efficacy has been observed with verapamil or trifluoroperazine. Thus, there is a need for an effective MDR reversing agent.2,4,6-Triamino-l,3,5-triazines are reported to be useful in the treatment of tissue hypoxia in European Patent Application 90733A.
