<ABSTRACT>
An insulation assembly (10) for insulating buildings is disclosed. The insulation assembly includes a low density, binderless, mineral fiber mat, such as a binderless fibrous glass batt (11) which is covered by a layer (20) to form a package. The batt (11) is joined to the package by an adhesive and an air passageway is defined by the package for directing atmospheric air to the batt (11). The insulation assembly (10) is lightweight and has a compression ratio in excess of 6:1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an insulation assembly
which is used to insulate buildings and, for examples, to
insulate floors, ceilings and the like of such buildings.It is well known in the art to insulate
buildings using various types of insulating materials
including mineral fibers such as fibrous glass wool.Prior art fibrous glass wool insulation often
included combining a binder, such as a phenolic resin
with glass wool subsequent to the fiberizing process.
The resultant insulating material assembly had sufficient
strength to support itself in long strips so that it
could be, for example, placed between adjacent wall studs
or ceiling trusses in a commercial or residential
building.Glass fiber insulation is generally made by
laying down a blanket of multiple horizontal layers of
glass fibers onto a moving belt. Very early on, in the
industry, no binder was used. However, by the late
1930's and early 1940's the industry began to use an
organic binder, such as the above-mentioned phenolic
resin, which was thought to be necessary to give the
insulation material structural integrity for handling, 
and to enable the blanket to recover its thickness and
insulating value after being compressed during packaging
and transportation. Thus, it is the current practice in
the prior art to apply such binder materials to the
fibers as the insulation blanket is being formed, and to
partially compress and heat the resulting blanket to cure
the binder and set the loft. The blanket is thereafter
cut into batts or rolls and tightly compressed for
packaging and transport.Numerous types of binder compositions have been
developed over the years as necessary components in prior
art insulation assemblies.The prior art teaches that a high recovery
ratio in a fibrous glass batt having a low density is
unexpected and not inherently found in binderless
products of the past. McMillin and Sakarash U.S. Patent
No. 2,610,337 teaches the use of ultra-fine glass fibers
to form soft, resilient mats for use as filling in
cushions and the like. This prior art patent indicates
that with such ultra-fine glass fibers, as much as 25 to
30% bonding agent may be used without causing undue
stiffness. The patent states "although the bat becomes
less resilient with decreased amounts of binder, as
little as 5% by weight of the binder, when calculated on
the weight of the finished product, has been successfully
employed." The prior art also teaches in WO 91/17326 a
compressible thermal insulation batt sealed in a
waterproof bag for building
