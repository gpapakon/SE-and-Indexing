<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
semiconductor integrated circuit devices and
manufacturing architectures of the same. More
particularly but not exclusively, the invention
relates to those technologies adaptable for use with
semiconductor integrated circuit devices having
dynamic random access memory ("DRAM") modules.Currently available DRAMs are typically designed
to include an array of rows and columns of memory
cells as disposed in a matrix form on a principal
surface of a semiconductive substrate at those cross
points or "intersections" between a plurality of word
lines and a plurality of bit lines, wherein each of
the memory cells consists essentially of a capacitive
element for accumulation of information and a metal
insulator semiconductor field effect transistor
(MISFET) for use in selecting a single memory cell, 
which is serially connected to the capacitive element.
The memory cell selecting MISFET is formed in an
active region of the semiconductor substrate which is
surrounded at its periphery by an element separation
or isolation region. The MISFET is generally designed
to consist of a gate oxide film and a gate electrode
integral with a corresponding one of the word lines
plus a pair of semiconductor active regions for use as
a source and drain of the transistor. A bit line is
disposed to overlie the memory cell selecting MISFET
in a manner such that it is electrically connected, to
one of the source and drain which is commonly shared
by two memory cell selection MISFETs. The information
accumulation capacitive element is laid out at a
location overlying the memory cell select MISFET and
is electrically coupled to the remaining one of the
source and drain.A DRAM device with the memory cell structure of
this type has been disclosed in Published Unexamined
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-291532 and other
publications. The memory cells of the DRAM as
disclosed therein are designed so that word lines are
increased in width or made "fat" in active regions
(the regions in each of which a word line serves as
the gate electrode of a memory cell select MISFET) and 
reduced in width or "thinned" in the remaining regions
in order to retain the required gate length when
miniaturizing or "downsizing" the memory cell select
MISFETs while at the same time minimizing the pitch of
word lines.In addition, the DRAM memory cells as taught by
the Japanese Application above is arranged so that the
bit lines are partly fattened to extend up to those
portions overlying the active regions and that a
planar
