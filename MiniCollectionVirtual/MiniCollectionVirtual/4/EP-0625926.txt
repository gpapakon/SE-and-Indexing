<DESCRIPTION>
 A TWO-PHASE SUPERSONIC FLOW SYSTEM FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a two-phase supersonic flow system of the kind where a l iquid -vapor or liqui d -gas mixture flowing at supersonic speed undergoes continuous dissolving of the gas in the liquid, or condensation of the vapor. As a result, the specific volume is reduced while the velocity of sound, after reaching a minimum, increases and the flow changes from supersonic to subsonic . This gives rise to the formation of a transition region in which an abrupt rise in the pressure as well as a rapid completion of the dissolving of the gas or the condensation of the vapor occurs . BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Two-phase flow systems in which steam and water at relatively low pressure enter the system, flow together at supersonic speed and then leave the system , as water , flowing at subsonic speed at a pressure higher than that of either incoming component , have been known for over 115 years . In the past, such systems have been used to increase water pressure where steam is available . A classic use of such a system is to pump water into a boiler using live steam from the boiler . Such known systems involve the use of supersonic steam flows which draw in water which enters the system. The two phase steam/water mixture enters an elongate flow tube in which the flow changes from supersonic to subsonic at a shock wave region where the pres sure rises sharply . Downstream of the shock wave region there is generally a gap in the flow tube which is sometimes surrounded by a cavity having an egress opening for drainage. As indicated in some of the references listed below, the gap/cavity/drainage system is used in the prior art systems during "start-up" to remove water which does not achieve the higher pressure which is achieved during operation. Examples of such prior systems can be found in U.S. Patents 177,313; 182,483; 209,220; 233,532; 280,589; 

1 316 , 804 ; 338 , 950 ; 369 , 097 ; 440 , 438 ; 49 5 , 286 ; 501 , 271 ;2 2,066,867; 4,252,572 and 4,951,713. Many of these patents3 are directed to the problems of start-up of the system and4 to its instabilities.5 While such systems have been in use for many years,6 they were not well understood. Only in 1968 was a7 comprehensive theory of operation published by Deich, M.E.8 and Philippov, G.A. (in "Gas Dynamics of Two Phase systems,"9 Moscow 1968, pp 267-274). This paper predicted that there is 0 a theoretical limit to the amount of pressure step-up ratio 1 which could be achieved, and that this
