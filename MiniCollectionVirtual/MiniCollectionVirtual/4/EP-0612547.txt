<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a balance design, wherein mobile matter (6) 
can be set into motion from one extreme resting position to another in 

different types of balance rooms (1) by the attachment of masses (7) to 
the upper part at variable distances from the centre of the balance room 

resulting ina an uninterrupted change of the moments on both sides of 
the centre of the balance room by way of which the balance room will tip 

over. 
The resting position of the mobile matter can be used to indicate 
e.g. a section of a playing field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device which can point to e.g. 
one or more parts of a playing-field or one or more persons in a 
group. The device is a balance constructed in such a way that the action 
of pointing can be related to the position of some mobile matter 
in the device. The device includes: 
mobile matter (cf.6 in figures 1 and 2) in a movable balance 
room; the movable balance room (1 in figures 1, 2 and 3) which is 
formed in such a way that masses can be attached; a connection system for the attachment of the balance room to 
the balance bridge, e.g. the balance cube (3); and the balance bridge (5). The balance room can be a closed tube or a partially opened tube 
like a groove or a combination of both. The balance room can be made movable in several ways, for example 
by means of a balance cube with axle (cf.3 en 4 in figures 1 and 
2), by means of a combination of axles, movable in different 
areas in relation to one another, by means of a ball-joint, or a 
spring, etc. The bottom of the balance room can be supported by, or the top 
can be suspended in the balance bridge. Within the balance room the mobile matter, which can be one or 
more rolling bodies or one or more liquids or solutions, can move 
between two extreme positions which lie on both sides of the 
point of suspension or support (S-point) of the balance room. The invention is different from all types of known balances in 
this respect that when the mobile matter in the lower extreme 
position of the balance room is set into motion by the attachment 
of mass to the upper part of the balance room, this will result 
in an uninterrupted decrease of the total moment on the lower 
part of the balance room; when the mobile matter passes the point 
where the totalized moments on both sides of the S-point have the 
same value, it will result in an uninterrupted increase of the  
 
total moment on the other part of the balance; the balance room 
then tips to the other side where the mobile matter will settle 
again. The action of pointing, which is the purpose of this invention, 
can be related to the extreme position of the mobile matter. Because of the fact that it is hard to predict how heavy the mass 
will have to be to set the matter into motion, which can even be 
made more difficult by changing the weight of the mobile matter, 
the device can be used for a balance game in which players can 
tip eachother's balance room to another part of a playing-field 
by fixing masses to the upper part of the balance room. The

<CLAIMS>
A pointer balance used for pointing at one or more parts of a 
playing-field, one or more persons in a group etc., consisting 

of an in one or more verticle levels 'tippable' balance 
room containing mobile matter like one or more balls, liquids 

or solutions, which can be made movable by attaching mass to 
the upper part of the balance room and/or rotation of the 

balance room with the mobile matter resulting in the movement 
of the mobile matter from one extreme resting position in the 

balance room to another extreme resting position, by way of 
which the balance room will tip over and after which the 

action of pointing can be related to the position of the 
mobile matter. 
A pointer balance according to claim 1, further including 
massholders attached to the balance room at different distances 

in relation to the tipping axle. 
A pointer balance according to claim 2, wherein at least a 
part of the mass-holders is detachable and interchangeable. 
A pointer balance according to claim 2 or 3, wherein at least 
a part of the mass-holders is designed as a multiple mass-holder. 
A pointer balance according to claims 1, 2, 3 and 4, wherein 
the tipping axle of the balance room is placed in, above or 

below the centre of gravity of the balance room.
