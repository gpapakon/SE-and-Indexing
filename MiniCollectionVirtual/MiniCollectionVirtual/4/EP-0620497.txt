<ABSTRACT>
A halftone phase shift photomask designed so that it is 
possible to shorten the photoengraving process, use a 

production line for a conventional photomask, prevent 
lowering of the contract between the transparent and 

semitransparent regions at a long wavelength in the visible 
region, which is used for inspection and measurement, and 

also prevent charge-up during electron beam exposure, and 
that ordinary physical cleaning process can be used for the 

halftone phase shift photomask. The halftone phase shift 
photomask has on a transparent substrate (1) a region which 

is semitransparent to exposure light and a region which is 
transparent to the exposure light so that the phase 

difference between light passing through the transparent 
region and light passing through the semitransparent region 

is substantially π radians. A semitransparent film that 
constitutes the semitransparent region is arranged in the 

form of a multilayer film including layers (3, 4) of 
chromium or a chromium compound. For example, the layer (3) 

is formed of chromium oxide, chromium oxide nitride, 
chromium oxide carbide, or chromium oxide nitride carbide, 

and the layer (4) is formed of chromium or chromium nitride. 
The layer (3) mainly serves as a phase shift layer, while 

the layer (4) mainly serves as a transmittance control layer 
that suppresses the rise of transmittance at the long 

wavelength side. The semitransparent film is formed by 
physical vapor deposition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photomasks used for
producing integrated circuits of high integration density,
e.g., large-scale integrated circuits (LSI), very large-scale
integrated circuits (VLSI), etc., and to photomask
blanks used to produce such photomasks. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a halftone phase shift
photomask whereby a projected image of very small size can
be obtained, and also to a halftone phase shift photomask
blank for producing the halftone phase shift photomask.
Further, the present invention relates to methods of
producing the halftone phase shift photomask and the
halftone phase shift photomask blank.Semiconductor integrated circuits, e.g., IC, LSI, VLSI,
etc., are produced by repeating thin film forming processes,
e.g., oxidation, CVD or sputtering, a photolithography
process and a diffusion process, e.g., ion implantation. In
the photolithography process, a resist is coated on a
substrate to be processed, e.g., a silicon wafer, and this
resist is subjected to exposure by a reduction projection
stepper or other exposure systems using a photomask to form a
desired pattern thereon, followed by development and
etching.With the achievement of high-operating speed and high
integration of semiconductor integrated circuits, the 
minimum size of photoresist patterns formed by the
above-described photolithography process has increasingly
been demanded to become smaller. Accordingly, the demanded
device patterns cannot be realized by the conventional
reduction projection stepper exposure method that employs an
ordinary photomask because of the resist pattern resolution
limit of this method. To overpass this limit, a phase shift
photomask having a novel structure and a phase shift
exposure method that uses the phase shift photomask have
been proposed, as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 58-173744 (1983) and
Japanese Patent Application Post-Exam Publication No. 62-59296
(1987). The phase shift exposure method is a
technique whereby the resolution and the depth of focus are
improved by controlling the phase of exposure light passing
through a phase shift pattern formed on a photomask.Phase shift photomasks having various arrangements have
been proposed. Among them, what is called halftone phase
shift photomask such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,890,309 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
(KOKAI) No. 4-136854 (1992) has attracted attention from the
expectation that it will soon be put to practical use, and
