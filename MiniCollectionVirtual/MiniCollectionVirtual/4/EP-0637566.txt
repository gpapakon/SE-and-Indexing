<ABSTRACT>
In the case of the low-oxygen filling of containers with gaseous beverages, each container is prepressurised and filled when it has reached the same pressure as a product store, in this process the inert gas/air mixture escaping into the product store, after which process the processes of discharging and drawing off take place. In this process, after initial prepressurising using the product store atmosphere, intermediate discharging is carried out to an adjustable discharging pressure, after which a second prepressurising process using the product store atmosphere is performed and filling, discharging and drawing off are performed, according to the apparatus the filling elements being connected via a valve, which is controlled by means of a stationary cam, to an intermediate discharging store with a pressure-setting valve.
