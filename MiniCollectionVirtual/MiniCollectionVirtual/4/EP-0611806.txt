following two components:

poly(3-methyl-1,5-pentane adipate)diol having a molecular 

weight of at least 2,000 and having a JIS A hardness at 25°C 
of not more than 80, and

principally comprising an aromatic vinyl compound and at 

least 1 block B comprising an olefinic elastomer, said 
aromatic vinyl compound being contained in an amount of 5 to 

50% by weight based on the weight of the block copolymer and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic 
elastomer composition comprising a specific polyurethane and 
a specific aromatic vinyl compound-olefinic compound block 
copolymer and having excellent flexibility and resistance to 
abrasion, heat and oil. Thermoplastic polyurethanes, having excellent abrasion 
resistance and oil resistance, are used for hoses, belts, 
tubes and the like, but they have the drawbacks of poor hot 
water resistance and weather resistance and hence their 
uses are limited. On the other hand, aromatic vinyl 
compound-olefinic compound block copolymers are excellent in 
rubber elasticity and hot water resistance, but their uses 
are also limited due to poor resistance to oil and abrasion 
and other drawbacks. To eliminate the drawbacks of both thermoplastic 
polyurethanes and aromatic vinyl compound-olefinic compound 
block copolymers, blending of the two components has been 
attempted. However, sufficient properties have not been 
created by the blending, since thermoplastic polyurethanes 
and aromatic vinyl compound-olefinic compound block copolymers 
generally have poor compatibility with each other. 
For example BP 1581167 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open  
 
No. 150464/1977 describe that molded articles having 
excellent tensile strength are obtainable from compositions 
comprising a polyether-based thermoplastic polyurethane and 
a block copolymer comprising a conjugated diene compound 
having a structure of X-Y-X (X: polymer block comprising an 
aromatic vinyl compound; Y: polymer block comprising a 
conjugated diene compound) with at least 70% of the 
conjugated diene compound part being hydrogenated. The 
above compositions, however, have poor transparency due to 
poor compatibility of the two components. It has also been attempted, in order to improve the 
compatibility of thermoplastic polyurethanes with aromatic 
vinyl compound-olefinic compound block copolymers, to add a 
dicarboxylic acid-modified block copolymer as a compatibility 
improving agent (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No. 115352/1981). However, this attempt can hardly be 
said to have achieved sufficient improvement. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
improve compatibility of a thermoplastic polyurethane and an 
aromatic vinyl compound-olefinic compound block copolymer 
and provide a thermoplastic elastomer composition having 
good flexibility and oil resistance. The present inventors have found that a specific 
thermoplastic polyurethane and a specific
