<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vuilleumier heat pump 
device and particularly relates to a countermeasure for 
avoiding lowering of efficiency accompanied by capability 
control in the vuilleumier heat pump device. A vuilleumier heat pump device is well known in the art 
such as disclosed in Laying Open unexamined Japanese Patent 
Application No.1-137164. In the vuilleumier heat pump device, 
as shown in FIG.1, a displacer (3H) on hot side (hot side 
displacer) which is reciprocally movably inserted in a cylinder 
(1H) on hot side (hot side cylinder) and a displacer (3L) 
on cold side (cold side cylinder) which is reciprocally 
movably inserted in a cylinder (1L) on cold side (cold side 
cylinder) are connected to each other through the medium of a 
crank shaft (5). Each displacer (3H), (3L) is reciprocated at 
a set phase difference (e.g., 90Â° ), and volumes of a hot 
space (9H) and middle-temperature space (10H) each defined 
and formed in the hot side cylinder (1H) by the hot side 
displacer (3H) and a cold space (9L) and a middle-temperature 
space (10L) each defined and formed in the cold side cylinder  
 
(1L) by the cold side displacer (3L) are respectively 
changed. Thereby, an working gas is changed in pressure to 
form a thermodynamic cycle. Also, heat input at a heater part 
(14H) which receives heat by a burner (17H) on the hot side 
cylinder side, heat input from a thermal medium, such as 
water, at a cooler part (17L) on the cold side cylinder side, 
and radiation to the thermal medium at middle-temperature 
heat exchangers (16H), (16L) are respectively conducted so 
that the thermal medium performs cooling or heating. A vuilleumier heat pump device disclosed in Laying Open 
unexamined Japanese Patent Application No.4-240359 changes 
the cooling capability and heating capability by adjusting 
flow rate of the thermal medium circulated between the middle-temperature 
heat exchangers (16H), (16L) and the cooler 
part (17L), and each of indoor and outdoor heat exchangers 
(23), (25), or by adjusting heating amount or cooling amount. In the vuilleumier heat pump device, the capability of 
the cooler part (17L) is controlled by increasing or decreasing 
a speed of rotation of the crank shaft (5) in such a 
manner that the crank shaft (5) is driven and rotated by a 
rotation control motor (21), or by adjusting a combustion 
rate of the burner (17H). In this case, however, while the cooling capability and 
the heating capability are increased according to the increase  
 
in the revolution speed,
