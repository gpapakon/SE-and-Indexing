<ABSTRACT>
Ski boot with a pivoting front cap including a rigid shell base (1) on which is at least partially articulated an upper (2) consisting of a front cap (3) and of a rear cap (4), the front cap (3) being mounted pivotably in the end zone (6) of the shell base (1) and covering over a longitudinal slot (5) made in its upper front part. On either side of the longitudinal slot in the front cap (3) are defined two transverse tongues (9', 9'') which are connected together by means of at least one flexible traction element (18) interposed between an anchoring element (19) of one of the transverse tongues (9'') and a manoeuvring member (20) integral with the other transverse tongue (9'), in order to constitute an inner clamping device (17) for the foot. According to the invention, the front part (16) of the front cap includes apertures (23) capable of permitting its free sliding with respect to corresponding spacers (21) of tongues (9') and (9''), so as to be pressed on the latter permanently and regardless of the relative position of the tongues as a function of the state of the internal clamping device for the foot.

Ski boot comprising a rigid shell base (1) on which an upper (2) is at least
partially journaled, the upper comprising a front cuff (3) and a rear spoiler (4), the front cuff

(3) being pivotally mounted in the end zone (6) of the shell base (1) and covering a
longitudinal slit (5) provided in its upper front portion, and on either side of which are

defined two transverse tongues (9', 9'', 26, 27) that are joined to one another by at least one
flexible traction element (18) interposed between an anchoring element (19) of one of the

transverse tongues (9'') and a maneuvering member (20) affixed to the other transverse
tongue (9') to constitute a foot tightening device (17), characterized in that the anchoring

element (19) as well as the maneuvering member (20) are affixed to each of the transverse
tongues (9', 9'') by means of spacers (21) on which they are fixedly mounted, so as to define

between them, by their respective lower planes (19a, 20a) and the upper planes (9'a, 9''a) of
each of the corresponding tongues (9', 9'',26, 27), a space (22) of a height (h) substantially

equal to the thickness "e" of the front cuff (3), freely housed therein by means of transverse
sliding slots (23) thereof that are crossed by said spacers (21), and that are covered by said

lower planes of the anchoring element (13) and of the maneuvering member (20), so as to
ensure a permanent application of said front cuff (3) against the tongues (9', 9'', 26, 27) in

a vertical direction, while allowing its free sliding on the tongues in a transverse direction,
regardless of the relative position of the tongues, whether they be close together in an active

tightening position or conversely, spaced in a release position.
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in that the intermediate spacers
(21), on which the anchoring element (19) and the maneuvering member (20) are affixed, are

cylindrical studs and are capable of receiving, in their center, screws (24) for affixing said
anchoring elements (19) and maneuvering member (20).
Ski boot according to claim 2, characterized in that the cylindrical studs (21)
constituting the spacers have a diameter (d) that is smaller than the width (l) of the transverse

slots (23) of the cuff (3) which they cross, so as to enable their free transverse sliding in
accordance with the relative position of the tongues (9', 9'').
Ski boot according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
sliding slots (23) have an overall oblong shape.
Ski boot according to claim 4, characterized in that the sliding slots (23) lead
to the longitudinal edges (16a, 16b) of the front portion (16) of the front cuff (3).
Ski boot according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
anchoring element (19) comprises a rack whose lower surface, defining the lower plane (19a) 

of its base, has larger dimensions than those of the corresponding sliding slot (23), at least
in its width (l), i.e., in the longitudinal direction of said cuff (3).
Ski boot according to one of claims 1-5, characterized in that the maneuvering
member (20) of the traction element (18) comprises a rocking lever journaled on a clip (25)

whose lower surface, defining the lower plane (20a) of its base, has larger dimensions than
those of the corresponding sliding slot (23), at least in its width (l), i.e., in the longitudinal

direction of said cuff (3).
Ski boot according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
transverse tongues (9', 9''), defined by the longitudinal slit (5) of the front cuff (3), have

dimensions that ensure their overlapping.
Ski boot according to one of claims 1-7, characterized in that the transverse
tongues (26, 27), defined by the longitudinal slit (5) of the front cuff (5), have dimensions

such that they face one another in a non-contiguous manner.
