The present invention relates to an antihypertensive 
agent (or hypotensive agent) of a new type. As antihypertensive agents, there have been known 
various compounds belonging to various groups. Representative 
antihypertensive agents are as follows:
 
   Ganglion blocking agents such as Hexamethonium bromide 
and Trimetaphan camsilate;
 
   Hydralazine agents such as Todralazine hydrochloride, 
Hydralazine hydrochloride, Cadralazine, and Budralazine;
 
   Rauwolfiae Radix agents such as Alseroxylon, Dimethylaminoethyl 
reserpilinate dihydrochloride, Syrosingopine, 
Rauwolfia alkaloids, Rescinnamine, and Reserpine;
 
   Sympatholytic agents such as Guanethidine sulfate, and 
Bethanidine sulphate;
 
   α₂ Agonists such as Guanfacine hydrochloride, Clonidine 
hydrochloride, Guanabenz acetate, and Methyldopa;
 
   Alkaloids such as Dihydroergotoxine mesilate;
 
   α₁ Blockers such as Urapidil, Terazosinn hydrochloride, 
Bunazosin hydrochloride, Prazosin hydrochloride, and 
Doxazosin mesilate;
 
   β-Blockers such as Carteolol hydrochloride, Bunitrolol 
hydrochloride, Propranolol hydrochloride, Methoprolol tartarate,

Captopril, Cilazapril, Enalapril maleate, and 
Lisinopril;
 
   Diuretics such as Indapamide, Tripamide, Furosemide, 
and Meticrane. An object of the present invention is to provide a new 
antihypertensive agent (or hypotensive agent) of a type 
differing from those of known types such as described 
above. The present invention resides in use of an imidazole 
derivative having the formula (1): 
Wherein:
 
   each of R¹ and R² independently is hydrogen atom, an 
alkyl group having 1-8 carbon atoms, an alkyl group of 2-6 
carbon atoms having an alkoxy group of 1-4 carbon atoms, a 
cycloalkyl group having 5-8 carbon atoms, an aryl group 
having 6-12 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 1-4 carbon
