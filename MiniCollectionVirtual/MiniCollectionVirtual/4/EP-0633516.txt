<ABSTRACT>
The voltage compensation circuit of the 
invention supplies a desired voltage to a portion to 

which the desired voltage is to be supplied, by compensating 
for voltage drops caused by line resistances of 

voltage supply lines. The voltage compensation circuit 
includes: a first voltage supply line having a first 

end; and a second voltage supply line having a second 
end. In the voltage compensation circuit, a first 

voltage which is higher than the desired voltage by a 
predetermined value is applied to the first end, and a 

second voltage which is lower than the desired voltage 
by the predetermined value is applied to the second 

end. The portion to which the desired voltage is to be 
supplied is connected to the first voltage supply line 

at a first junction, and the portion to which the 
desired voltage is to be supplied is connected to the 

second voltage supply line at a second junction. An 
amount of voltage drop in the first voltage from the 

first end to the first junction is substantially equal 
to an amount of voltage rise in the second voltage from 

the second end to the second junction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a voltage
compensation circuit for supplying a desired voltage to
portions to which the voltage is to be supplied (hereinafter
referred to as voltage-supplied portions) by
compensating for voltage drops which occur because of
line resistances of a voltage supply line. The present
invention also relates to a display apparatus, provided
with such a voltage compensation circuit, for displaying
an image with multiple gray scales.Figure 13 shows the construction of a conventional
liquid crystal display apparatus. The liquid
crystal display apparatus includes a liquid crystal
display panel 21, a plurality of data drivers 22, and a
control power supply circuit 23. The liquid crystal
display panel 21 includes a plurality of picture elements
(not shown) arranged in a matrix. The plurality
of data drivers 22 selectively supply gray-scale voltages
to the respective picture elements included in
the liquid crystal display panel 21. The control power
supply circuit 23 supplies the gray-scale voltages to
the respective data drivers 22. The data drivers 22
are not formed on the liquid crystal display panel 21.
The control power supply circuit 23 is connected to the
substrate 24 via a supply line 25. The data drivers 22
are interconnected with each other via printed wirings
(not shown) formed on the substrate 24. The liquid
crystal display panel 21 is connected to the data
drivers 22 via driving terminals (not shown) of the 
liquid crystal display panel 21. In order to simplify
the description of the construction of the conventional
liquid crystal display apparatus, scanning drivers for
scanning the picture elements included in the liquid
crystal display panel 21 are not shown in Figure 13.In the conventional liquid crystal display
apparatus having the above-described construction, it
is possible to sufficiently reduce the line resistances
of the supply line 25 and the printed wirings. Thus,
the voltage drops caused by the line resistances of the
supply line 25 and the printed wirings become so small
that they are negligible. Accordingly, the quality of
an image displayed on the liquid crystal display apparatus
with multiple gray scales is generally not degraded
by the drop of the gray-scale voltage applied to one
end of the supply line 25 from the control power supply
circuit 23.However, in the case where the liquid crystal
display panel 21 and the voltage supply line form an
integrated unit, without using the substrate 24, it is
impossible to make the line resistance of the voltage
