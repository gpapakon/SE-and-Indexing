<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hose pump with sliders arranged one behind the other in the direction of extension of the hose, the front faces of which act in rhythmic alternation on the hose and which are controlled by angularly staggered eccentric discs (7) which rotate about a common axis (x-x) and, in order to provide a structurally advantageous system, proposes that the common axis (x-x) be made up of stub sections (8) which project on one side (a) of an eccentric disc (7) and engage in corresponding recesses (9) in the adjacent eccentric disc (7).

Hose pump with slides (2), arranged one behind the 
other in the direction of extension (arrow x') of the hose 

(4), which act on the hose (4) with their front faces (3) 
in rhythmic change and are controlled by eccentric discs 

(7) arranged angularly offset and which rotate about a 
common axis (x-x), characterised in that the common axis 

(x-x) is formed of axle stubs (8) which in each case 
project on one side (a) of an eccentric disc (7) and engage 

in corresponding recesses (9) of the respective adjacent 
disc (7). 
Hose pump according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the axle stubs (8) are moulded to the eccentric discs (7) 

consisting of a plastic which is of uniform material and 
which are situated adjacent to insertion pins (13) which 

are moulded on to material which is similarly of uniform 
material, for capturing the angularly offset arrangement of 

the eccentric discs (7) the insertion pins (13) in each 
case engage in holes (14) of adjacent eccentric discs (7). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the excess (y) of the axle 

stub (8) is smaller than the depth (z) of the recesses (9). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the eccentric discs (7) at 

their ends are provided with terminal discs (7') of which 
one has a bearing pin (18) coaxial to the recess (9) and 

the other one also has a bearing pin (18) in a coaxial 
position opposite to the axle stub (8). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the axial bracing of the 

eccentric disc packet is achieved through support of the  
 

outer broad surface of the terminal discs (7') on bearing 
walls (20) of the bearing pins (19). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised by the axle stubs (8) being polygonal 

and the corresponding recesses (9) being adapted to this 
polygonal shape. 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the eccentric discs (7) 

arranged one above the other and the slides (2) are 
combined into one packet (P) by means of bearing walls (20) 

arranged on both ends, which packet (P) can be pulled out 
of the housing (1) via a rail guide (30) of the carriage-forming 

bearing walls (20). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised by an automatic separation of the 

eccentric disc - rotary drive wheel (tooth wheel 27) on 
removal of the packet (P). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a stop means (29) for preventing 

the bearing walls (20) from being pulled out. 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the stop means (29) is 

constructed to be a locking plate (36). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that both bearing walls (20) 

arranged one above the other are secured by a stop means 
(29). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a bearing wall connecting bar (41) 

passing through the eccentric discs (7) which reaches into  
 

the bearing walls (20). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a frictional connection between 

connecting bar (41) and the bearing walls (20). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the connecting bar (41) runs 

along the common axis (x-x) of the eccentric discs (7). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the rails (32) of the rail 

guide (30) are constructed as bearing guide plates (33) 
which can be fastened to the housing (1). 
Hose pump according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the front ends of the bearing 

guide plates (33) carry retaining screws (37) for the 
locking plate (36).
