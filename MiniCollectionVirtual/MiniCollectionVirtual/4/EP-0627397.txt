An (S)-1-phenyl-2-substituted propane derivative 
shown by the following formula (I) 


   wherein R¹ and R² represent a lower alkyl group, 
etc., or R¹ and R² may form together an alkylene group, 

etc.; R³, R⁴ and R⁵ represent a hydrogen atom, etc.; 
and X represents a hydroxyl group which may be protected 

with a protective group, or a halogen atom etc., can 
readily be produced (i) by permitting a microorganism 

belonging to the genus 
Torulaspora
, the genus 
Candida
,

Pichia
 or the like to act on a phenylacetone 
derivative and asymmetrically reducing the compound, or 

(ii) by sterically inverting an (R)-enantiomer. (R,R)-1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-methylethyl)amino]ethanol 

derivative having a high optical purity can easily be

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optically 
active (S)- or (R)-1-phenyl-2-substituted propane 
derivative which is an important intermediate for synthesis 
of an (R,R)-1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-methylethyl)amino]ethanol 
derivative, and a method of 
producing the same. The present invention further 
relates to a method of producing the ethanol derivative 
which is useful as a medical compound or an intermediate 
product thereof. As anti-obesity agents or anti-diabetic agents 
belonging to a new category of agents without using 
insulin, 1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-methylethyl)amino] 
ethanol derivatives are noted since the derivatives act 
selectively on a β3-receptor in vivo, thus having 
extremely low side effects. Pharmacological studies on 
the 1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-methylethyl)amino]ethanol 
derivatives have revealed that the β3-action substantially 
depends on (R,R)-enantiomers thereof (see J. 
Med. Chem., 35, 3081 (1992), and U.S. Patent 
5,061,727). For example, the above-mentioned U.S. 
Patent discloses that an (R,R)-5-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]-1,3-benzo  
 
dioxole-2,2-dicarboxylic acid disodium salt has a 
higher activity than the corresponding (S,S)-enantiomer 
by a factor of 47. For the production of an optically active 1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-methylethyl)amino]ethanol 
derivative, 
there is known an optical resolution of a racemic 
form or a racemate, or an asymmetric synthesis. For example, the above mentioned U.S. Patent 
5,061,727 discloses a method of producing an (R,R)-1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-methylethyl)amino]ethanol 
derivative 
which comprises (1) allowing a racemic 2-amino-1-phenylethanol 
derivative to react with a phenylacetone 
derivative and sodium cyanoborohydride to produce a 
mixture of four species of optical isomers of a 1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-methylethyl)amino]ethanol 
derivative, 
(2) isolating and removing an (R,S)-isomer and an 
(S,R)-isomer from the mixture, and (3) optically resoluting 
an (R,R)-isomer and an (S,S)-isomer by a diastereomer 
method. According to this method, however, it 
is necessary to isolate and purify only the (R,R)-isomer 
from the mixture of the four species of optical 
isomers, therefore, the processes are complicated and 
the yield is decreased. Further, since large quantities 
of raw materials are required, the method is also 
disadvantageous in economical factor. The U.S. Patent and the Journal of Medicinal  
 
Chemistry as mentioned above disclose a method allowing 
an (R)-3-chlorostyrene oxide derivative to
