<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new industrial
processes for the preparation of vitamin K derivatives,
which play an important role in the vital body as
hematostatic vitamins, coenzyme Q derivatives, which are
useful as therapeutic agents for ischemic heart diseases
such as congestive heart failure, and the like, and
intermediates useful for the preparation thereof.It has heretofore been known that quinone derivatives
can be prepared by reacting 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone
(common name: menadione; in the following chemical reaction
formula, R1 and R2 form a benzene ring), 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methylbenzoquinone
(in the following chemical reaction
formula, R1 = R2 = a methoxy group), or the like with an
allyl halide derivative in accordance with the Friedel-Crafts
reaction as shown by the following chemical reaction
formula: 

wherein R1 and R2 are identical with or different from each
other and mean individually a lower alkyl or lower alkoxy
group, or may form an aromatic ring together, n stands for 0
or an integer of 1-9, and a linkage  is a single or
double bond.Besides, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI)
No. 56935/1985 discloses a process for preparing a quinone
derivative by forming 1,4,4aα,9a-tetrahydro-9aα-methyl-1α,4α-methanoanthraquinone
from 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone
and cyclopentadiene, reacting this product with an allyl
halide derivative into a 1,4,4aα,9a-tetrahydro-9aα-methyl-4aα-alkenyl-1α,4α-methanoanthraquinone,
and then subjecting
the thus-obtained product to a Retro Diels-Alder reaction.In the conventional processes for preparing quinone
derivatives, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methylbenzoquinone
or the like has been used as a starting
material as shown in the above chemical reaction formula. 
However, these compounds have been extremely expensive and
hence difficult to obtain in a great amount on an industrial
scale. Further, quinone derivatives produced by conducting
the Friedel-Crafts reaction undergo geometric isomerization
on the allyl group. Therefore, the final product is
provided as a mixture of cis (Z) and trans (E) isomers. In
addition, they are very difficult to separate from each
other to purify them because their physicochemical
properties are similar to each other. Accordingly, this
process has not been said to be an industrially or
economically satisfactory process.On the other hand, the process disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 56935/1985 can
improve the disadvantage that the geometric isomers are
formed, but has
