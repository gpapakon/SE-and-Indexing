<ABSTRACT>
The holder can be secured to the balcony slab underside. It has a post retaining socket (3), vertically protruding at the front end of its elongated, profiled body which contains flat faces (4-6) on the top side near the socket, in the middle section, and at the rear end. Between the front flat face (4) and middle one (5) is formed a depression (7) with an obtuse angle. On the depression front flank is a horizontally adjustable equalising block (8), whose surface, facing the depression is oblique.
