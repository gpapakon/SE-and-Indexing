<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for cleaning materials and/or equipment surfaces
in semiconductor manufacturing using nitrogen trifluoride according to the opening
clause of claim 1 and a corresponding cleaning process.Generally the present invention is directed to the field of thermal cleaning with nitrogen
trifluoride etchant. More specifically, the present invention is directed to cleaning various
silicon-containing semiconductor substances from wafers and chemical vapor deposition
equipment including quartz vessels and hardware using a dynamic flow of nitrogen
trifluoride at elevated temperatures with a unique vacuum and removal system and
process.The semiconductor industry has experienced a long-felt need to solve the problem of
cleaning chemical vapor deposition furnaces and quartz tubes in the furnaces as well as
quartz hardware of various undesired substances such as silicon nitride, polycrystalline
silicon, titanium silicide, tungsten silicide and various other silicides as well as silicon
dioxide which are typically present as undesired films on furnaces and quartz hardware
because of their deposition on silicon wafers and chips being processed as electronic
materials and integrated circuits. The normal procedure for cleaning is to remove the 
parts, such as those made of quartz, metals or other materials from a furnace, such as
quartz furnace tubes, and perform a wet chemical cleaning. O-ring seals would typically
have to be replaced in such an operation, as well as cleaning of lines, doors and other
vacuum components. Another alternative is to use another piece of equipment and
perform a plasma cleaning. The wet chemical cleaning is very costly and time consuming.
When the equipment is shut down to pull the quartz parts, it can require up to 18
hours of time. Also, the system necessitates reverification for its operating integrity
before it can be used again. Direct cleaning application requires special chemicals,
equipment and sinks to perform this cleaning. Another disadvantage is that the quartzware
is attacked at
accelerated rates which affects its reproducibility and reliability of operation. This is
especially true when cleaning quartz racks or wafer holders. These components have
special slots cut in the quarts to hold the parts being coated, and when the wet chemical
clean attacks the quartz, it affects the dimensions of these slots. When the slots are
affected, the parts being held are not coated uniformly, which requlres the quartz be
replaced at accelerated scheduling.The
