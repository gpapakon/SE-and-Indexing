<ABSTRACT>
Amino acid and nucleotide sequences for hemagglutinin and fusion glycoproteins of several wild-type measles strains are provided, and shared amino acid variations in wild-type measles glycoproteins are identified in five wild-type measles viruses. A consensus polypeptide, the amino acid sequence of which reflects variation common to more than one wild-type strain, is the basis for constructing live attenuated vaccines, or recombinant vaccines to replace older, less efficacious vaccines. Immunological reagents useful in differentiating wild-type measles strains from the other known strains also can be produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
 WILD-TYPE MEASLES VIRUS GLYCOPROTEINS: VACCINE AND DETECTION METHOD THEREFORBackground of the Invention-*•$ Measles virus was first isolated in cell culture in 1954 from* 5 David Edmonston. The Edmonston strain of measles virus became the progenitor for many live-attenuated measles vaccine strains which include Moraten, see Hilleman et al.. JAMA 206: 587-90 (1968), currently the only licensed measles vaccine strain in the United States. Aggressive vaccination programs instituted in the mid- 10 1960's resulted in a precipitous drop in reported measles cases from near 700,000 in 1965 to only 1500 in 1983.Since 1989 dramatic increases in both the numbers and severity of measles cases were reported. In 1989, greater than 17,000 cases of measles and 43 associated deaths were reported in 15 the United States. Nearly 100 fatalities from measles-associated illnesses and greater than 27,000 cases of measles were reported in 1990. Approximately half of the measles cases were in unvaccinated preschool populations, whereas the remaining 50% were in previously vaccinated populations. Outbreaks have continued to 20 occur into 1991, at approximately the rate observed in 1989.The resurgence of measles is not understood causally, but may be attributed to a failure to vaccinate key inner city populations and to a low but significant rate of primary vaccine failure to raise immunity (estimated at 3-5%). Secondary vaccine failure, 25 which occurs when a person's post-vaccination titre of antibodies drops to a non-protective level after an period of time passes, also is a suspected cause.The measles resurgence is reflected in a rising epidemic of measles infections among young, previously-immunized adults, in 30 particular persons who are immunocompromised. To account for this development in measles epidemiology, it is postulated that transmission of virus is occurring from vaccinated individuals who harbor subclinical measles infections, or, alternatively, that infection arises from the live-attenuated vaccine itself. 35 The effort to curb the measles resurgence has focused on the role played by measles virus structural proteins in inducing immunity in a vaccinated mammal. The measles virus, like many members of the paramyxovirus family, contains six major structural 

proteins: the matrix protein, hemagglutinin, the fusion protein, large protein, phosphoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. Of these, the envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and fusion, have been shown to be responsible for induction of measles virus-
