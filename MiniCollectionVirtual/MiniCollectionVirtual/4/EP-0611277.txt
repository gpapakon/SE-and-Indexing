<ABSTRACT>
Equipment and method for air conditioning in a vehicle, in particular a rail vehicle, having a central air-conditioning device (10) whose outlet is connected via an inlet channel (13) to at least one compartment (2) or area of the vehicle, each compartment (2) or each area having a temperature sensor (4) which is connected to a compartment control unit (3) for measuring the internal temperature and at least one positively ventilated floor heater element (6) which can be actuated by the compartment control unit. According to the invention, the compartment control unit (3) is connected to a reheating element (8) via which inlet air flows from above into the compartment. In heating mode, this compartment control unit (3) controls the power output of the floor heater element (6) as a function of the temperature sensor (4), the reheating element (8) being controlled in such a way that the temperature of the inlet air remains approximately constant. In cooling mode, this compartment control unit (3) controls the power output of the reheating element (8) as a function of the temperature sensor (4), the floor heater element (6) being switched off.

Method for air-conditioning the inside of a vehicle, in 
particular a rail vehicle, in which fresh and/or warm air is 

supplied to at least one compartment (2) or vehicle region, 
of which the internal temperature is measured, wherein in 

heating operation circulating air heated in dependence upon a 
predeterminable desired temperature is introduced into the 

compartment (2) or vehicle region in the floor region, 
characterised in that air flowing into the compartment or 

vehicle region from above is heated in cooling operation in 
dependence upon the predetermined desired temperature and in 

heating operation is kept at an approximately constant 
temperature. 
Air-conditioning installation for a vehicle, in 
particular a rail vehicle, with a central air-conditioning 

device (10) of which the outlet is connected by an inlet-air 
duct (13) to at least one compartment (2) or vehicle region 

of the vehicle, wherein each compartment (2) or each vehicle 
region further comprises a temperature sensor (4) connected 

to a compartment control unit (3) to measure the internal 
temperature, and at least one expediently ventilated floor 

heating body (6) which can be controlled by the compartment 
control unit, characterised in that the compartment control 

unit (3) is connected to a secondary heating body (8), via 
which air flows into the compartment from above, wherein 

during heating operation this compartment control unit (3) 
controls the power output of the floor heating body (6) in  

 
dependence upon the temperature sensor (4), and the secondary 

heating body (8) is controlled in such a way that the 
temperature of the inlet-air remains approximately constant, 

and wherein during cooling operation this compartment control 
unit (3) controls the power output of the secondary heating 

body (8) in dependence upon the temperature sensor (4), and 
the floor heating body (6) is switched off. 
Air-conditioning installation according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the floor heating body (6) has out-flow 

openings in the immediate floor region, through which the 
warm air is blown horizontally into the compartment (2) or 

vehicle region. 
Air-conditioning installation according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that in the vehicle at least two 

compartments (2) or vehicle regions are provided and that the 
secondary heating bodies (8) are disposed in the inlet-air 

duct (13) above each compartment (2) or vehicle region. 
Air-conditioning installation according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that in the vehicle a single compartment (2) 

or a single vehicle region is provided and that the secondary 
heating body (8) is integrated into the air-conditioning 

device. 
Air-conditioning installation according to any of claims 
2 to 5, characterised in that each compartment control unit 

(3) of a vehicle is connected to a single installation  
 

control unit (9) which is connected to the air-conditioning 
device (10), a duct temperature sensor (11) and the secondary 

heating body (8) of each compartment (2) or vehicle region, 
wherein this installation control unit (9) controls the 

operation of the air-conditioning device (10) and, in heating 
operation, controls the power output of the secondary heating 

bodies (8) in dependence upon the duct temperature sensor 
(11) and the desired room temperature value. 
Air-conditioning installation according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the installation control unit (9) is 

further connected to an external temperature sensor (12), 
wherein the operation of the air-conditioning device (10) is 

controlled in dependence upon the external temperature sensor 
(12).
