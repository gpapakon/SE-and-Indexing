<ABSTRACT>
A method of providing a circulating air flow in a treatment space for a working area, whereby inlet air (A) is blown into the treatment space (1) to form a circulating air flow (A') in the treatment space, which flow provides an air curtain (A'') at an access opening (5) to the treatment space. In order to eliminate the disturbing influence of a workpiece (4) within the working area (3) on the circulating flow and to improve the working conditions, at least a part (B) of the circulating air flow (A') is deflected from the working area in such a way that the working area remains essentially within the circulating air flow. An arrangement for carrying out the method comprises a duct (7) formed in the treatment space (1) and passing the working area (3) for at least a part (B) of the circulating air flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
providing a circulating air flow in a treatment space 
separated from the surroundings for a production 
line, a working area or the like, whereby inlet air 
is blown into the treatment space to form a circulating 
air flow in the treatment space, which flow provides 
an air curtain at an open access opening to the 
treatment space to prevent entrance of ambient air. From European Patent Application 510 637 (considered as prior art under Article 54 (3) EPC) is previously 
known a method of obtaining an air change in 
a treatment space, in which the condition of the air 
is kept divergent from that of the ambient air by 
means of an air flow circulating in the treatment 
space, which air flow forms an air curtain at an access 
opening to the treatment space tc prevent entrance 
of ambient air. The circulating air flow is 
thereby created by means of an air jet to be blown 
into the treatment space. The method saves a considerable 
amount of energy and improves the working 
conditions. However, some drawbacks are associated with the 
arrangement. Disturbances are easily caused in the 
circulating flow by workpieces positioned within the 
working area, on account of which a mixing with ambient 
air takes place and the conditions in the 
treatment space remain worse than in case of an undisturbed 
flow. A strong blow from the outer edge of 
the working area efficiently prevents the air from 
escaping from the lower part of the treatment space, 
but is unpleasant for the worker, and therefore, the 
improvement in the working conditions remains smaller 
than could be concluded on the basis of the mere temperature.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide 
a method by means of which flow losses caused by 
a workpiece in the treatment space are eliminated almost 
entirely and the working conditions are improved 
remarkably. This object is achieved by means of the 
method according to the invention as defined 
in claim 1. The basic idea of the invention is that a part 
of the circulating air flow directed towards the 
workpiece in the treatment space is caused to flow 
past the workpiece outside the actual working area in 
such a way that the workpiece remains in the middle 
of the circulating flow or at least within the range 
of a low flow rate. In this manner it is possible to 
eliminate essentially the disturbing influence of the 
workpiece on the circulating flow, which improves the 
working conditions. At the same time, the rate of the 
air flow is

<CLAIMS>
A method of providing a circulating air flow in a treatment space separated from 
the surroundings by a cabinet comprising a permanently open access opening (5), 

whereby inlet air (A) is blown into the treatment space (1) with an initial rate so high as to 
form a circulating air flow (A') around a working area, production line or the like within 

the treatment space, which flow provides an air curtain 
at the open access opening (5) to the treatment 

space (1) to prevent entrance of ambient air, and whereby at least a part (B) of the 
circulating air flow (A') is deflected from the working area (3) on the access opening side 

of the treatment space, caused to flow outside the actual working area (3), production 
line or the like and returned on the opposite side with respect 

to the access opening in such a manner that the working area remains essentially 
within the circulating flow and the rate of airflow within the 

working area is reduced. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the deflected part (B) of the 
circulating air flow (A') is returned to the working area at a bottom of the treatment 

space on a back wall side (9) of the treatment space. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the part (B) of the 
circulating air flow (A') to be deflected is removed from the working area (3) by 

means of a suction effect of an inlet air jet (A) blown below the working area. 
An arrangement for providing a circulating air flow in a treatment space separated 
from the surroundings by a cabinet comprising a permanently open access opening (5) 

to the surroundings, the arrangement further comprising:  
 


means (6; 13) for blowing inlet air (A) into the treatment space in such a way and with 
such an initial rate that the inlet air forms an air flow (A') circulating in the 

treatment space (1) around a working area, production line or the like, and 
which flow provides an air curtain (A") 

at the permanently open access opening to prevent 
entrance of ambient air, and 
a duct (7; 12) formed in the treatment space (1) and bypassing the working area (3), production line or the like, for bypassing at least a part (B) of the circulating air 
flow (A') outside the working area, production line or the like such that the rate of airflow within the working area is reduced, wherein the duct (7; 12) 

comprises an inlet (8) positioned adjacent to the access opening (5) of the treatment 
space (1) and an outlet (9) positioned on the opposite side of the treatme
nt space 
with respect to the access opening. 
An arrangement according to claim 4,

 the passing duct is a 
flow duct (7) between a working level, forming the working area (3), and a bottom 

plate (2a) of the treatment space (1).
