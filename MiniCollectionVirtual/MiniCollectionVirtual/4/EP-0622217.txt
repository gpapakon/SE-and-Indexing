<ABSTRACT>
A method for making an image using a direct thermal imaging element, 
comprising on a support a thermosensitive layer incorporating an 

organic silver salt and a reducing agent contained in said 
thermosensitive layer and/or in other optional layers, said imaging 

element being imagewise heated by means of a thermal head having 
energisable heating elements, characterised in that the activation 

of the heating elements is executed line by line with a line duty 
cycle Δ representing the ratio of activation time to total line 

time, such that the following equation is satisfied


P ≦ P
max
 = 3.3 W/mm² + (9.5 W/mm² x Δ) 



 
wherein P
max
 is the maximal value over all heating elements of the 
time averaged power density P dissipated by a heating element during 

a line time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording method for direct 
thermal imaging. Thermal imaging or thermography is a recording process wherein 
images are generated by the use of imagewise modulated thermal 
energy. Thermography is concerned with materials which are not 
photosensitive, but are sensitive to heat or thermosensitive and 
wherein imagewise applied heat is sufficient to bring about a 
visible change in a thermosensitive imaging material, by a chemical 
or a physical process which changes the optical density. Most of the direct thermographic recording materials are of the 
chemical type. On heating to a certain conversion temperature, an 
irreversible chemical reaction takes place and a coloured image is 
produced. In direct thermal printing, said heating of the recording material 
may be originating from the image signals which are converted to 
electric pulses and then through a driver circuit selectively 
transferred to a thermal printhead. The thermal head consists of 
microscopic heat resistor elements, which convert the electrical 
energy into heat via the Joule effect. The electric pulses thus 
converted into thermal signals manifest themselves as heat 
transferred to the surface of the thermal paper wherein the chemical 
reaction resulting in colour development takes place. This principle 
is described in "Handbook of Imaging Materials" (edited by Arthur 
S. Diamond - Diamond Research Corporation - Ventura, California, 
printed by Marcel Dekker, Inc. 270 Madison Avenue, New York, ed 
1991, p. 498-499). A particular interesting direct thermal imaging element uses an 
organic silver salt in combination with a reducing agent. Such 
combination may be imaged by a suitable heat source such as e.g. a 
thermal head, laser etc. A black and white image can be obtained  
 
with such a material because under the influence of heat the silver 
ions are developed to metallic silver. However, when imaged with a thermal head it appears to be difficult 
to obtain a neutral black tone image. For this purpose it has been 
suggested to add toning agents, but these still do not yield 
satisfactory results. Furthermore, it appears to be difficult to 
obtain a desired number of grey levels which may be required for 
some application, in particular if the image is to be used for 
medical diagnostic purposes. On the other hand, other applications may require only dense black 
image on a white background. Such applications are those in which 
only line-art is to be reproduced e.g. bar code printing,
