<ABSTRACT>
The body structure of a railway vehicle is 
constructed by assembling roof panels (11), eaves panels 

(12), window header panels (13) and such like. Each 
panel is provided with framing shapes in its periphery, 

and the contiguous framing shapes of the adjacent panels 
are joined together by welding. Fixture holding members 

(31,32) for holding fixtures, such as a central ceiling 
holding member (31) and side ceiling holding members 

(32), are attached to the framing shapes, and fixtures 
and equipment including ceiling boards and lighting 

fixtures are fastened to the fixture holding members, 
respectively. This enables reliable, secure and easy 

attachment of the fixtures and equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a railway 
vehicle and to a method for equipping the interior of the 
same, more particularly, to a structure suitable for a 
railway vehicle to be equipped with miscellaneous 
equipment elements including thermal insulating fixtures 
and interior finishing parts. Saving weight of the body structure of a 
railway vehicle for reducing noise or power consumption 
has become more important with the progressive 
enhancement of the travelling speed of railway trains. 
The body structure is exposed to high positive and 
negative pressures varying in a wide range due to the 
variation of the external pressure while the train is 
running through a tunnel at a high travelling speed of 
200 km/hr or above. Therefore, the body structure must 
have an improved pressure resistance as well as a 
sufficiently high shearing rigidity and a sufficiently 
high bending rigidity. A body structure designed to meet 
such requirements, such as proposed, for example, in 
Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 3-90468, employs 
aluminum honeycomb panels constructed by joining the 
component parts by brazing. When attaching equipment to the interior 
structure of a conventional vehicle provided with 
equipment and screw seats welded thereto, the equipment 
is positioned in place by gauging, and then threaded 
holes in which equipping screws are screwed are formed. Since each equipping requires positioning by 
gauging, it needs much time and labor to fit out the 
rolling stock. Another equipping structure, such as 
proposed, for example, in Japanese Utility Model 
Publication (Kokoku) No. 60-9096, is provided with 
equipping rails on its ceiling structure. Interior  
 
equipment elements, particularly, ceiling equipment, are 
assembled in a unit, and the unit of interior equipment 
is fitted on or attached with screws to the equipping 
rails. The face plates of the aluminum honeycomb 
panels are comparatively thin aluminum alloy plates, to 
form the aluminum honeycomb panels of lightweight 
construction. Therefore, it is inappropriate, from the 
viewpoint of securing holding rigidity, to attach 
equipment directly to the aluminum honeycomb panels with 
screws. Furthermore, welding the screw seats, which 
usually are thin plates, or the like to the face plates 
of the aluminum honeycomb panel requires advanced 
techniques and very difficult work to secure reliability. Although the arrangement of the equipping rails 
of the known equipping structure described above, for 
holding units of interior
