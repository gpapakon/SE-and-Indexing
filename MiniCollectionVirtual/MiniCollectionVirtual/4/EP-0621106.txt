<ABSTRACT>
The air supply line is arranged at the tool body or a holder across a rotary distributor. The nozzles are measuring nozzles and the air blown against the wall of the drilling. A pneumatic pressure measuring system is provided. The pressure measuring system (18) reproduces the alterations of the pressure head, changing with the width of the air gap, between the measuring nozzles (3), representing the dia. alteration of the drilling. The pressure measuring system (18) is arranged in the flow direction of the air behind the rotary distributor (5), namely rotating together with the tool body (2).

<CLAIMS>
Pneumatic measurement apparatus for the determination of 
the diameter of a bore to be machined in a workpiece by 

means of a rotating tool body, in particular of a honing 
tool body, comprising a pneumatic pressure source - which 

is, as a rule, stationary - which is connected via 
a rotary distributor, and via at least one air supply 

line communicating therewith and arranged in or on the 
tool body or its mounting, with measurement nozzles at 

the tool body via which the supplied air is blown 
against the wall of the bore, and comprising a pneumatic 

pressure measuring arrangement which reproduces changes 
of the stagnation pressure, which varies with the width 

of the air gap between the measurement nozzles and the 
wall of the bore, or represents it as a change in the 

diameter of the bore, characterised in that the pressure 
measuring arrangement (18) is arranged in the flow direction 

of the air after the rotary distributor (5), 
i.e. rotates together with the tool body (2). 
Measurement apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterised 
in that a wireless transmission of the measured 

value is provided between the pressure measuring 
arrangement (18) and a display. 
Measurement apparatus in accordance with claim 1 or 
claim 2, characterised in that a wireless energy supply 

is provided for the pressure measuring arrangement (18) 
and/or the part of the measured value transmission system 

arranged on the tool body (2) or its mounting (1). 
Measurement apparatus in accordance with one of the 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the pressure measuring  

 
arrangement (18) is arranged on the tool body (2) 

or in the tool body (2). 
Measurement apparatus in accordance with one of the 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the pressure measuring 

arrangement (18) is arranged on or in the mounting 
(1) of the tool body (2). 
Measurement apparatus in accordance with one of the 
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the pressure measuring 

arrangement (18) reacts to a pressure difference 
between a first line branch (13) connected to the measurement 

nozzles (3) and a second line branch (12) which 
is connected to a reference nozzle (16) with a preset 

restrictor resistance arranged on the tool body (2) or 
on its mounting (1). 
Measurement apparatus in accordance with one of the 
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that for the calibration 

of the measurement device centrifugal force dependent 
influences on the pressure measuring arrangement (18) 

are recorded separately.
