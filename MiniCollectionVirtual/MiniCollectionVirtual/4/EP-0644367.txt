<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic moulding (4) for the subsequent insulation of joining and branching locations of metal pipes which have been provided with heat insulation at the factory, in particular of helically wound pipes. In order to be able to produce such mouldings (4) in a cost-effective manner and to be able to use them for a plurality of pipe dimensions, it is provided that the moulding comprises a single-piece injection moulding which is slit longitudinally on one side and of which the expansion joint (7) runs in the axial direction of the metal pipe to be insulated. Furthermore, the moulding (4), produced from a soft, elastic thermoplastic, exhibits, at its ends, at least one stepped extension (11, 12) with a smaller diameter. The moulding (4) can be fixed securely by a slit sleeve (5) comprising helically wound plastic strip. If required, the moulding (4) can be demounted without destroying the sealing device.

Plastic moulding with at least one slit sleeve for 
subsequent insulation of connecting and branching points 

of metal pipes insulated thermally in production, whereby 

the moulding (4) consists of a one-piece injection 
moulding slit longitudinally on one side and whose 

dividing joint (7) runs in the axial direction of the 
metal pipe, 
the moulding (4) is made of a soft elastic 
thermoplastic, 
the moulding (4) exhibits at least one stepped shoulder 
(11, 12) of smaller diameter at its ends, 
the slit sleeve (5) is made of a plastic strip wound in 
a spiral which after fitment surrounds the moulding (4) 

securely but if necessary detachably. 
Moulding according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the dividing joint (7) takes the form of a tongue and 

groove joint (8, 9). 
Moulding according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that a circumferential notch (13) of V-shaped cross-section 

is disposed in the junction area with the 
shoulders (11, 12) of in each case smaller diameter. 
Moulding according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the sleeve (5) is made of a spiral 

strip of hard polyvinyl chloride. 
Moulding according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the overlap portion (14) of the 

spiral plastic strip of the sleeve (5) is at least 20% of 
the unwound strip length.
