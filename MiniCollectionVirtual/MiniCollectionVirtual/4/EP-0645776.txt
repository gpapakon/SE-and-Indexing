<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor memory device comprises an address bus 
having plural bits for designating addresses included in a 

first address group assigned to a memory cell array and in a 
second address group assigned to plural test modes, a first 

address decoder for decoding addresses in the first address 
group, and a second address decoder for decoding addresses 

in the second address group. A test commanding section 
generates a test commanding signal responsive to any one of 

addresses assigned to plural test modes. The second decoder 
acting as a test mode selecting section is activated by the 

test commanding signal to generate a test mode selecting 
signal from addresses assigned to the test modes. A test 

performing section tests inside the memory device in one of 
the test modes based on the test mode selecting signal. 

Number of data items to be input for executing a test inside 
the memory device is reduced without increasing an external 

pins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory
device and, more particularly, to a semiconductor memory
device provided with a test performing section capable of
executing memory tests in a plurality of test modes.In semiconductor integrated circuit devices including
semiconductor memory devices, a function test is executed in
a plurality of test modes. The test modes include one
executed when a memory device is finished to a product and
another executed when the product is installed in service.
Hence, when a memory device is to be tested, it is necessary
to input to the memory device a test mode selecting signal
for selecting one of predetermined test modes as well as a
test commanding signal for switching the memory device to a
test operation mode.In general, switching a memory device from a normal
operation mode to a test operation mode is effected by
inputting a predetermined address assigned to a test 
operation mode of the memory device via an address bus,
simultaneously with inputting a test mode selecting signal
via one of external test mode pins each corresponding to one
of several test modes. However, with an increasing higher
integration and finer pattern of a memory device, it is
requested that the number of external pins be decreased.In some memory devices, selection of one of several
test modes is effected by inputting data for designating the
one of the test modes through data bus instead of providing
a test mode selecting signal via a corresponding external
pin. In this case, however, there is a drawback that the
number of data items to be input for performing a test is
large resulting in a complicated sequence of a memory tester
for testing the memory device.An object of the present invention is to provide a
semiconductor memory device in which a reduced number of
data items is required for performing a test and in which
number of external pins is not increased for the test.The present invention provides a semiconductor memory
device comprising a substrate, a plurality of memory cells
arrayed on the substrate and each having an address included
in a first address group, an address bus composed of a
plurality of bits for receiving an address signal
designating one of addresses included in the first address 
group or one of addresses included in a second address group
assigned to a plurality of test modes, a first address
decoder operatively connected between the address bus and
the memory cells for decoding addresses included in the
first address group for the memory cells, a
