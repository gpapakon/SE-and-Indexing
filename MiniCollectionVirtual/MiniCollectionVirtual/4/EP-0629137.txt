<ABSTRACT>
A corneal sculpting system utilized for performing surgery to reshape the cornea of the eye. The system includes a laser delivery system that is coupled to a filter positioning system and a corneal topography system. The filter positioning system suspends a sculpting filter above the surface of the cornea. The sculpting filter controls the level of tissue removal that occurs in each area of the cornea by absorbing a certain percentage of the incident laser energy in various areas of the filter. The positioning system also has a conduit for delivering water to the corneal surface. A thin layer of water is heated by the application of the laser to cause microexplosions that dislodge and propel the tissue to ablate the cornea. The corneal topography system provides real time feedback on the curvature of the cornea, before, during and after the surgery.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CORNEAL SCULPTING USING LASER ENERGYBackground of the Invention Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to the field of corneal sculpting. Description of the Related ArtIn order to alter the focal point of the eye, several surgical techniques have been used. The most common of these techniques is Radial Keratotomy which comprises cutting slits in the cornea of the eye. The slits selectively weaken portions of the eye to allow intraocular pressure to distort the corneal surface and therefore change the shape of the cornea. Radial keratotomy has been found to be effective when the surgery is performed correctly. However, this procedure is a non-repeatable procedure and thus, high precision is necessary. The precision that is required to alter the cornea to the exact shape to refocus the lens is difficult to achieve using conventional cutting techniques especially when the rate of scar formation from these cuts causes variations in the final results. Another technique, called corneal sculpting,â€¢has been used to alter the focal point of the eye. Unlike radial keratotomy, which requires relatively deep precisely located cuts, corneal sculpting involves wide area ablation which covers the entire optical zone of the cornea. Typically, ultraviolet (UV) laser light is used to shave off thin layers of corneal tissue in a process analogous to "sanding." Although UV lasers such as excimer lasers are able to achieve the accuracy necessary to shape the cornea, such lasers have inherent disadvantages for surgical applications on the eye. For example, Excimer lasers are very large expensive systems that utilize toxic gases to generate the required laser energy. In addition, some physicians believe the ultraviolet radiation of the excimer laser is potentially mutagenic and may cause unacceptable long term side effects to the remaining exposed tissues of the eye. 

 Al hough infrared (IR) lasers do not suffer from the disadvantages of UV lasers, infrared lasers have not been widely used for ablation of eye tissue, because of other disadvantages which include the possibility of thermal damage to the eye. The temperature of the surrounding eye tissue tends to increase during the application of the laser, due to the fact that eye tissue has a high water content. As the temperature of the tissue increases, so does the risk of long term thermal damage to the cornea. Thus, an improved method for tissue removal that avoids thermal damage is necessary for performing corneal sculpting with IR lasers.In order to
