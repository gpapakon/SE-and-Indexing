<ABSTRACT>
A line card (2) in a private branch exchange (1) accommodates interfaces 
(8) which switch standard output frames (SF) on a system bus (SB). These standard 

output frames (SF) contain control data (C) in addition to subscriber data (B1,B2). As a 
result, the system frame of the system bus (SB) is not filled efficiently. By switching 

only the subscriber data (B1,B2) from the standard output frames (SF) to the system bus 
(SB) by the switching means, the system frame is filled efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a private branch exchange comprising a line card, 
which card includes a plurality of interfaces for accommodating data from incoming 
subscriber lines in standard output frames, these frames comprising subscriber data and 
control data. The invention further relates to a line card to be used in such a private 
branch exchange. A known interface to be used on a line card in a private branch exchange 
is the ISAC®-S interface from Siemens. A manual in which this interface is described is 
called "ICs for Communications, ISDN Subscriber Access Controller, ISAC®-S, PEB 
2085". This manual will further be referred to as ISAC®-S manual. The ISAC®-S 
inserts data of incoming subscriber lines into standard output frames which are further 
filled up with control data. These standard output frames are switched to a system bus, 
the so-called IOM®02 bus. This bus conveys these data to other system components 
present on the line card. The IOM®-2 bus has a standard system frame comprising 8 
channels accommodating each exactly one standard output frame of an ISAC®-S 
interface. By programming the ISAC®-S interfaces there may be determined which 
channel is assigned to which interface. The standard output frames comprise data which 
cannot be used in certain types of private branch exchanges and are thus redundant. 
This means that the frame is not filled efficiently. Each IOM®-2 bus is basically only 
suitable for processing the data coming from 8 interfaces. It is an object of the invention to provide a private branch exchange of the 
type defined in the opening paragraph in which an efficient filling of the system frame 
is obtained. A private branch exchange according to the invention is characterized in 
that the line card comprises switching means arranged for switching only the subscriber 
data from the standard output frames in a system frame to a system bus. This achieves 
that the control data not used in other system components available on the line card do 
not end up on the system bus. In lieu of these control data only subscriber data are  
 
switched to the system bus. This means that more interfaces can be connected to an 
IOM®-2 bus in a private branch exchange according to the invention than to an IOM®-2 
bus used in prior-art manner. An embodiment for a private branch exchange according to the invention 
is characterized in that the interfaces are divided into a first group and a second group 
while the switching means, at least partly distributed over the interfaces, are
