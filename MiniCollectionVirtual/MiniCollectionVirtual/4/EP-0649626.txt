<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses the use of wear measuring elements (16) 
to monitor the wear of cleaning elements (14) on cleaning devices, such 

as cleaning machines (10) and vacuum cleaners. The wear measuring 
elements (16) are located adjacent to cleaning elements (14) and have 

a length corresponding to a minimum desired length for the cleaning 
elements (14). When the length of the cleaning elements (14) decreases 

due to usage to the length of the wear measuring elements (16), the 
user will realize that the cleaning elements (14) need replacement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
monitoring the degree of wear for cleaning elements. More 
specifically, the present invention provides an apparatus 
for indicating when the cleaning elements need replacement. Cleaning machines, such as floor scrubbers and vacuum 
cleaners, are commonly used to remove dirt and other debris 
from various surfaces. The surfaces may be either soft 
surfaces, such as carpeted floors, or hard surfaces, such 
as concrete, wood, or tile floors. Typically, cleaning 
machines use numerous cleaning elements, such as brushes, 
mounted on a rotating disk or cylinder to remove dirt and 
debris from the surface. As used herein, "cleaning 
element" refers to a raised area or projection that removes 
dirt or other debris from a surface by frictional forces. 
Cleaning machines may employ a variety of liquid cleaning 
agents to assist in removing dirt and debris. Brushes, and other types of cleaning elements, in 
cleaning machines will wear and decrease in length over 
time causing numerous problems. The cleaning efficiency of 
the cleaning elements, especially brushes, decreases as the 
length of the elements decreases. For example, the 
bristles in cleaning brushes grow stiffer as length 
decreases, thereby causing dirt to be "flicked" by the 
brush away from the suction intake of the cleaning machine.  
 
As a result, less dirt is removed from the surface. The 
bristles in the brush also may become spread out and/or 
become flattened, decreasing the degree of agitation or 
scrubbing of the surface and therefore the cleaning 
efficiency of the brush. In light of cleaning element wear, timely replacement 
of the cleaning elements is an important factor in 
controlling cleaning costs. If cleaning elements are 
replaced when overworn, the inefficiency of the cleaning 
machine will require increased man hours to clean the 
surface adequately. If cleaning elements are replaced 
prematurely, cleaning costs increase due to unnecessary 
cleaning element replacement. These problems are a common occurrence due to the 
difficulties experienced by users in knowing the proper 
time to replace cleaning elements. The two methods 
commonly used to determine when to replace cleaning 
elements are highly inaccurate. In the first method, the 
user visually inspects the elements to determine the degree 
of wear. Users, however, typically have little experience 
or guidance concerning what is the maximum desired degree 
of cleaning element wear and often err on the side of 
removing the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for cleaning, comprising: 
   a mounting member; 

   cleaning elements connected to said mounting member 
and including at least a first cleaning element having a 

first length that decreases during usage; and 
   wear measuring elements connected to said mounting 

member and including at least a first wear measuring 
element having a second length that is less than said first 

length and corresponds to a predetermined wear length for 
said first cleaning element; 

   wherein the difference between said first and second 
lengths is related to an amount of remaining wear 

associated with said first cleaning element. 
An apparatus, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein: 
   the number of all of said wear measuring elements is 

substantially less than the number of all of said cleaning 
elements and said wear measuring elements are not used to 

clean on each surface that the apparatus is used with. 
An apparatus, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein: 
   said mounting member has a longitudinal extent that 

spans an entire length thereof, with some of said cleaning 
elements being located along adjacent first and second 

paths that extend along said longitudinal extent, at least 
one of said wear measuring elements being located within an 

area bounded by and including said first and second paths 
and a distance therebetween, and with the number of said 

wear measuring elements located within said area being less 
than 25% of the number of said cleaning elements located 

along said first and second paths. 
An apparatus, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein: 
   said cleaning elements include one or more bristles. 
An apparatus, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein: 
   some of said cleaning elements are located along 

adjacent first and second curved closed paths and in which 
at least one of said wear measuring elements is located 

within an area bounded by and including said first and 
second paths and a distance therebetween, and with the 

number of said wear measuring elements located within said 
area being less than 25% of the number of said cleaning 

elements located along said first and second paths. 
An apparatus, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein:
