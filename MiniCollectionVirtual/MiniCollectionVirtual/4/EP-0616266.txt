<ABSTRACT>
The image forming apparatus can retain a stable and high 
image quality for many hours without use of any high precise 

mechanical parts and without causing any non-uniformity and mal-registration 
in color image. In the image forming apparatus, an 

image recording medium (photosensitive drum) (6a) is driven by 
a rotative driving mechanism (pulleys and belts); and an 

image recording section (print bar) (6c) records an image 
repeatedly on the rotating image recording medium (6a) in a 

direction perpendicular to a rotational direction of the image 
recording medium. The image recorded on the image recording 

medium (6a) is transcribed onto an image transcribing medium 
(paper) (22) being fed in the rotational direction of the image 

recording medium (6a) to form an image. In particular, the 
apparatus comprises a rotation detecting section (rotary encoder) 

(6r) for detecting angular travel rates of the image recording 
medium (6a); and a recording timing control section (5) for 

controlling recording timing (HSYNC) at which the image is 
started to be recorded in the direction perpendicular to the 

rotational direction of the image recording medium (6a), on the 
basis of the angular travel rates detected by the rotation 

detecting section (6r).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus, and more specifically to such an image forming
apparatus that an image is recorded on a rotating image
recording medium and further the recorded image is transcribed
onto an image transcribing medium fed in the same direction
as the rotative direction of the image recording medium.Conventionally, various image forming methods are adopted
for printing apparatuses (e.g., printer) for forming an image
on an image forming medium (e.g., paper). For instance, the
typical methods are: (1) electro-photographic method such that
an image is formed electro-statically on a photo-sensitive
drum, the formed image is changed so as to be visible by use
of toner, and then the toner image is transcribed onto a paper
as an image; (2) an ink jet method such that ink is directly
jetted onto a paper to form an image; (3) a silver halide
photographic method such that an image is exposed and recorded
on a photosensitive color forming substance; etc.In the case where a color image is formed by use of a
printing apparatus based upon the electro-photographic method,
this electro-photographic method is further classified into
some methods as follows: (1) A monochromatic (of the three
primary colors of yellow, magenta and cyan and in addition
black in some cases) toner image is formed on a photo-sensitive
drum and the formed toner image is transcribed onto
a paper. The above-mentioned process is repeated three times
for three colors. (2) Three-color toner images are formed on
a photosensitive drum, and the formed toner images are
transcribed onto a paper simultaneously. (3) Four image
forming units (for three primary colors and black) each for
forming a monochromatic toner image are arranged in the paper 
feed direction in sequence, and a color image is formed by
superposing (overlapping) the four monochromatic images. In
these methods, the method for arranging a plurality of image
forming units in the paper feed direction (referred to as
tandem method) is one of the best methods in that the
apparatus is high in printing and recording speed and small
in size.Fig. 2 shows an example of the construction of the tandem
color image forming apparatus of electro-photographic type,
in which four monochromatic (yellow, magenta, cyan and block)
image forming units 6, 7, 8 and 9 are arranged in the paper
feed direction (in the arrow direction). The respective image
forming unit is composed of a photosensitive drum 6a, 7a, 8a
or 9a (image recording medium), a print bar 6c, 7c, 8c or
