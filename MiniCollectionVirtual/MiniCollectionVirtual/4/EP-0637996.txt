<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are devices for detecting the presence of a preselected analyte in a fluid sample. The devices comprise a substrate microfabricated to define a sample inlet port (16), and a mesoscale flow system that includes a sample flow channel (20) extending from the inlet port. The mesoscale flow system further includes an analyte detection region (22) in fluid communication with the flow channel (20) comprised of a binding moiety for specifically binding the analyte. The detection region is constructed with a mesoscale dimension sufficiently small to enhance binding of the binding moiety and the analyte. The binding moiety may be immobilized in the detection region. The mesoscale detection systems of the invention may be used in a wide range of applications, including the detection of cells or macromolecules, or for monitoring reactions or cell culture growth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods and 
apparatus for conducting analyses. More particularly, 
the invention relates to the design and construction of 
small, typically single-use, modules capable of 
receiving and rapidly conducting a predetermined assay 
protocol on a fluid sample. In recent decades the art has developed a very 
large number of protocols, test kits, and cartridges 
for conducting analyses on biological samples for 
various diagnostic and monitoring purposes. 
Immunoassays, agglutination assays, and analyses based 
on polymerase chain reaction, various ligand-receptor 
interactions, and differential migration of species in 
a complex sample all have been used to determine the  
 
presence or concentration of various biological 
compounds or contaminants, or the presence of 
particular cell types. Recently, small, disposable devices have been 
developed for handling biological samples and for 
conducting certain clinical tests. Shoji et al. 
reported the use of a miniature blood gas analyzer 
fabricated on a silicon wafer. Shoji et al., Sensors 
and Actuators, 15:101-107 (1988). Sato et al. reported 
a cell fusion technique using micromechanical silicon 
devices. Sato et al., Sensors and Actuators, A21-A23:948-953 
(1990). Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp. 
(USA) has manufactured a microprocessor-controlled 
laser photometer for detecting blood clotting. Micromachining technology originated in the 
microelectronics industry. Angell et al., Scientific 
American, 248:44-55 (1983). Micromachining technology 
has enabled the manufacture of microengineered devices 
having structural elements with minimal dimensions 
ranging from tens of microns (the dimensions of 
biological cells) to nanometers (the dimensions of some 
biological macromolecules). This scale is referred to 
herein as "mesoscale". Most experiments involving 
mesoscale structures have involved studies of 
micromechanics, i.e., mechanical motion and flow 
properties. The potential capability of mesoscale 
structures has not been exploited fully in the life 
sciences. Brunette (Exper. Cell Res., 167:203-217 (1986) and 
164:11-26 (1986)) studied the behavior of fibroblasts 
and epithelial cells in grooves in silicon, titanium-coated 
polymers and the like. McCartney et al. (CancerRes., 41:3046-3051 (1981)) examined the behavior of 
tumor cells in grooved plastic substrates. LaCelle 
(Blood Cells, 12:179-189 (1986)) studied leukocyte and 
erythrocyte flow in microcapillaries to gain insight 
into microcirculation. Hung and
