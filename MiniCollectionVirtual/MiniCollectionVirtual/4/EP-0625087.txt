<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing sheet elements of end-wood type for use as wear surfaces for floors, tables or the like. According to the invention a longitudinally sawn piece of wood (10) is sawn up with cuts oblique to the longitudinal direction into plates of larger area than the cross-sectional area of the piece of wood. Thereafter the plates (12) are laid next to each other and joined together by complementarily shaped edge surfaces to form a sheet end-wood element. The invention also relates to a sheet element made in accordance with the above described method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
sheet elements of end-wood typ for use as wear surfaces for 
flooring, counters and the like. For many many years it has been known to manufacture floor 
surfaces made up of end-wood pieces in the form of relatively 
short wood blocks, which can consist of cut-off posts with 
essentially circular end surfaces or cut-off sawn planks or 
pieces of lumber with preferably rectangular cross-sectional 
areas. Such floor surfaces of blocks have a number of advantages. 
Inter alia, they are very wear-resistant and pleasant 
to walk on as well as being aesthetically pleasing. For 
outdoor purposes, impregnated woodblocks of round cross-section 
are often laid in sand, asphalt or other filler 
material, which can absorb the natural moisture-induced 
movements in the wood. For indoor environments, depending on 
the use, blocks of primarily rectangular cross-sectional 
shape have been glued together into composite blocks or 
sheets which are later sawn and sanded into either self-supporting 
massive block floor-boards or a relatively thin 
wear-layer for block ply floor-boards, which are tongued and 
grooved to facilitate laying the boards to make a floor. In the corresponding manner counters and tables can be made 
of blocks of rectangular cross-section. Despite the fact that such end-wood products have often been 
greatly appreciated due to their wear-resistance and pleasant 
appearance, they have never come into widespread use due to 
their tendency to crack or be deformed with changes in moisture. 
Cracking is due primarily to the fact that the movement 
of moisture in the wood varies in different directions, i.e. 
it is about twice as great in the tangential direction of the 
growth rings as it is radially to the growth rings, so that 
the internal stresses in the wood will become excessive.  
 One method of substantially dealing with this problem has 
been to stabilize the dimensions of the wood with the aid of 
various chemicals. This is, however, expensive and often 
unacceptable for environmental reasons. Another method of reducing the risk of cracking is to saw out 
pieces of wood with triangular cross-section and glue them 
together into a composite block, which is in turn sawn up 
transversely to the fiber direction into sheets or stave or 
board-like products (see e.g. SE-A-9100830-0). If, when gluing 
together the sawn-out pieces of wood - regardless of 
whether these are triangular or of other shape, e.g. rectangular, 
in cross-section - the

Method of manufacturing a sheet element of end-wood type 
for use as a wear surface for a floor, table or the like, 


characterized
 in that a longitudinally sawn 
piece of wood (10), preferably of triangular or square cross-section, 

is sawn up with parallel cuts (14;14') oblique to 
the longitudinal direction, into plates (12,12'), the cut 

area of which is greater than the cross-sectional area of the 
piece of wood, whereafter the plates (12;12') are laid next 

to each other and joined together with complementarily shaped 
edge surfaces (12a,12b,12c;12'a,12'b,12'c) to form a sheet 

end-wood element (16;16'). 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the longitudinally sawn piece of wood (10) is sawn up 

with oblique cuts (14;14') within an angular range of about 

30-75Â° to a plane normal to the longitudinal axis of the 
piece of wood (10). 
Method according to Claim 2, 
characterized
 
in that the longitudinally sawn piece of wood (10) is sawn at 

such an angle to a plane normal to the longitudinal axis of 
the piece of wood (10), that the sawn-out plates (12;12') 

will have an essentially uniform movement of moisture in all 
directions in the surface plane of the plates. 
Method according of one of Claims 1-3, 
characterized
 
in that the plates (12;12') are joined together by 

gluing. 
Method according to one of Claims 1-4, 
characterized
 
in that the plates (12;12') are sawn relatively 

thick in order to form upon joining together a self-supporting, 
massive sheet of end-wood type, e.g. a table top. 
Method according to one of Claims 1-4, 
characterized
 
in that the plates (12;12') are sawn relatively thin 

to form a relatively thin wear layer of end-wood type for a  
 

laminated product, e.g. for gluing onto a supporting substrate, 
such as a particle board, plywood, core board or the 

like. 
Method according to one of Claims 1-6, 
characterized
 
in that the edge surfaces of the sheet element 

(16;16') are made perpendicular to the plane of the sheet 
element. 
Method according to one of Claims 1-7,

are provided with complementary tongues and grooves. 
Sheet element of end-wood type for use as a wear surface 
for floors, tables or the like, 
characterized
 
in that it is made of obliquely sawn-out plates (12;12'), 

preferably of triangular or square cross-section, from longitudinally 
sawn pieces of wood (10), said plates being joined 

together with complementarily shaped edge surfaces (12a,12b,
