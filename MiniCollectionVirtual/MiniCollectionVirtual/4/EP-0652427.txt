<ABSTRACT>
Use: determination of critical parameters and physico-chemical properties of various media, for example viscosity, viscoelasticity, density, humidity or the like. Essential content of the invention: the device contains an oscillator having electrodes which is placed in a housing, means containing a computer which are for exciting oscillations and for acquisition, registering and processing of signals, the oscillator being fastened with the aid of spheres having an electrically conductive surface, and the oscillator being mounted in a support such that it can be displaced relative to the spheres. The oscillator may be designed in various alternative forms, for example as a cylinder, disc, rod, plate, sphere; it may be hollow and contain a web as well as elements which increase its useful surface area. The device is equipped with a high-pressure vessel and may also be used at high pressures.
