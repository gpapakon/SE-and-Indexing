<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a novel process for 
using a recently discovered dipeptidylaminopeptidase isolated 

from the cellular slime mold, 
Dictyostelium discoideum
 (dDAP). 
The claimed process involves immobilizing dDAP onto a support 

surface so that even numbered, N-terminal dipeptides can be 
efficiently removed from precursor proteins or polypeptides 

to yield desired processed proteins or polypeptides. The 
invention provides a means for reusing dDAP in multiple 

conversion reaction runs, as the enzyme does not become a part 
of the substrate/product solution. The claimed process is 

particularly useful for converting a precursor human 
proinsulin analog (Met-Arg-Human Proinsulin having Lys at 

position 28 and Pro at position 29 of the corresponding 
insulin B-chain; MR-KPB-hPI) to a processed insulin analog 

(Human Proinsulin having Lys at position 28 and Pro at 
position 29 of the corresponding insulin B-chain, KPB-hPI).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made in the field of
biotechnology and concerns a method of using immobilized
dipeptidylaminopeptidase isolated from the slime mold,
Dictyostelium discoideum. The invention is useful for
processing proteins having an even numbered amino acid N-terminal
extension.Dictyostelium discoideum is a primitive eukaryotic
microorganism commonly called a slime mold, or more
specifically, a cellular slime mold. The name is derived
from the two extreme states of the microorganism from a
macroscopic perspective. When actively growing, D.
discoideum grows as single cell amoeba. At this stage the
organism has no cell wall, hence it appears as a thin film
(or slime). Upon starvation on a solid medium, the
independent cells aggregate to form a colony. The colony
exhibits traits of a multicellular organism in that it
migrates in the form called a slug and then differentiates,
with the posterior cells of the slug forming a foot, the
anterior cells forming a stalk and the middle cells forming a
fruiting body. The organism is found naturally on the
surface of soil and dung. The wild type amoeba obtains
nutrients exclusively by ingestion (phagocytosis) of whole
bacteria; for this reason, the organism is sometimes referred
to as carnivorous. Axenic mutants of D. discoideum have been
isolated which are capable of growth without coculture of
"food" bacteria and which therefore can be grown on soluble
media. The present invention relates to the immobilization
and use of a novel dipeptidylaminopeptidase (DAP) isolated
from D. discoideum.Dipeptidylaminopeptidases are enzymes which
hydrolyze the penultimate amino terminal peptide bond
releasing dipeptides from the unblocked amino-termini of 
peptides and proteins. There are currently four classes of
dipeptidylaminopeptidases (designated DAP-I, DAP-II, DAP-III
and DAP-IV) that differ based on their physical
characteristics and the rates at which they react with their
substrates. DAP I is a relatively non-specific DAP that
catalyzes the release of many dipeptide combinations from the
unblocked amino termini of peptides and proteins. DAP I
shows little or no activity if the emergent dipeptide is X-Pro,
Arg-X, or Lys-X (where X is any amino acid). DAP II
shows a preference for amino terminal dipeptide sequences
that begin with Arg-X or Lys-X, and to a lesser extent, X-Pro.
DAP-II exhibits significantly lower reaction rates
versus most other dipeptide combinations. DAP III appears to
have a propensity toward amino terminal dipeptide sequences
of the form Arg-Arg and
