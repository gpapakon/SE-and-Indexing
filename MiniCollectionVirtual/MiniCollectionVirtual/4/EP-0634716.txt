<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for coordinating a mode of 
communication between a host module (10, 29) and a receiving module 

(41) wherein a specific data string is selected which, when sent to a 
receiving module (41), specifically a printer, requests the printer to 

convert to a packetized data command format. If the printer is capable of 
communicating in a packetized format the printer converts accordingly and 

transmits the appropriate response to the computer. If, on the other hand, 
the printer is not capable of communicating in a packetized format and 

does not recognize the specific data string, the specific data string will be 
ignored by the printer as null characters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a method and apparatus for
coordinating a communication mode between a host module and a receiving module,
and more specifically, relates to a method and apparatus for selecting a preferred
communication mode in response to a predetermined signal between a computer and a
printer.Page Description Languages (PDL) are typically used to communicate
information from a computer to a printer. This information is usually transmitted as a
continuous stream data flow. The information transmitted generally includes control
information and task specific information, such as text to be printed. Control
information relates to the state of the printer, whereas task specific information relates
to the character content of the specific print task at hand. The control information
transmitted from the computer to the printer might include, but is not limited to,
information related to a particular PDL being used, a printer address that identifies a
specific printer on a network, a print job priority, a specific paper bin to be used, and
paper feed rates. Task specific information would control the placement of ink on
each page by defining the characters or dots comprising graphics that are to be
printed. In this regard, an important aspect of PDL is the compatibility of the
information exchange between the host computer and the receiving printer. To
provide greater efficiency in exchanging data from a computer to a printer over a
network, the continuous stream data is normally converted into packetized data at a
network interface card. At a printer server, the packetized data is converted back to
continuous stream data for input to the printer.In a more general sense, the communication exchange between a host
module and a receiving module categorically falls into either unidirectional or bi-directional
modes of communication. Unidirectional data flow moves information in
only one direction, commonly from the host module to the receiving module; there is 
little or no reverse communication of information from the receiving module back to
the host module. The communication between a computer and a printer is generally
unidirectional from the computer to the printer; the only information then provided the
computer regarding the printer's status is a handshake signal indicating whether the
printer is on-line and ready to accept data from the computer. If the printer is not
ready to accept commands from the computer, the computer receives limited
information from the printer regarding

A method for effecting a preferred communication mode
between a host module (10,29) and a receiving module (41),

comprising the steps of:

(a) selecting a specific data string to be transmitted
between said host module (10,29) and said receiving module

(41), said data string being selected so as to avoid producing
an error indication in a current communication mode that is

different than the preferred communication mode;
(b) transmitting said specific data string between said host
module (10,29) and said receiving module (41); and
(c) in response to one of the host module (10,29) and
receiving module (41) receiving the data string, changing from

the current communication mode to the preferred communication
mode if both the host module (10,29) and the receiving module

(41) are compatible with the preferred communication mode, and
if not, continuing to operate in said current communication

mode; wherein said one of the said host module (10,29) and said
receiving module (41) transmits a predefined command back to

the other of said host module (10,29) and said receiving module
(41) in the preferred communication mode if it is compatible

with the preferred communication mode.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said host module
(10, 29) is a computer and said receiving module (41) is a printer.
The method of Claim 1, wherein said data string is
interpreted as a null sequence in the current communication mode by said

one of the host module (10, 29) and receiving module (41).  
The method according to claims 1 to 3 for attempting to
initiate a packetized communication mode between a host module

(10,29) and a receiving module (41), wherein

in step (a) a sequence of data characters is selected that
when received by a receiving module (48) able to operate in the

packetized communication mode, will indicate to said receiving
module (41) that the host module (10,29) desires to initiate 

the packetized communication mode, and which if received by a
receiving module that is not able to operate in the packetized

communication mode, will be interpreted as null data and
ignored;
in step (b) the sequence of data characters are transmitted
from the host module (10,29) to the receiving module; and
in step (c) if said receiving module (41) can operate in
said packetized communication mode, in response to said

sequence of characters, said receiving module (41) communicates
with the host module (10,29) in said packetized communication

mode, and if not, continues to communicate with the host module
(10,29) in a communication mode different than the packetized

communication mode.
The method according to claims 1 to 3 for inititating
packetized communication mode in a receiving module (41)

operating in a non-packetized communication mode, wherein:

in step (a) a sequence of characters is selected that when
received by said receiving module (41) capable of operating in

the packetized communication mode are recognized as a request
change to the packetized communication mode, but which are

interpreted as null data and ignored by a receiving module (41)
that is unable to operate in the packetized communication mode;
in step (b) said sequence of characters is transmitted to
said receiving module (41); and
in step (c) if said receiving module (41) is able to operate
in said packetized communication mode, upon receipt of said

sequence of characters, said receiving module (41) is changed
to said packetized communication mode and if not continues in

said non-packetized communication mode without indicating any
error due to receipt of said sequence of characters.

between a host module (10, 29) and a receiving module (41), comprising:


controller means (37, 47) for receiving and evaluating data
and commands;
random access memory (35, 45), electrically coupled to the
controller means (37, 47), for providing a working memory for said

controller means (37, 47);
non-volatile memory, coupled to the controller means (37,
47), for storing programs and predefined data and commands;
means (33, 43) for altering said communication mode
between said host (10, 29) and said receiving module (41) in response to a

predefined data string transmitted from one of said host (10, 29) and said
receiving module (41) to the other, said controller means (37, 47) ignoring

said predefined data string if said other of the host (10, 29) and said
receiving module (41) is unable to operate in said communication mode.
The apparatus of Claim 6, further comprising means
for comparing a sequence of data characters received against the

predefined data string, wherein, when said predefined data string is
received, said means selects a communication mode.
