<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a circuit arrangement for generating at least one DC output voltage (across 18,19) from an at least largely sinusoidal AC input voltage (across 2, 3) of a first frequency, having a first rectifier arrangement (1), to which the AC input voltage (across 2, 3) can be supplied and from which a rectified voltage can be drawn at a DC voltage output (4, 5), a first inductance (6), a second rectifier arrangement (7) and a first filter capacitance (8), which form a series circuit which is connected together in this cited order and is arranged in parallel with the DC voltage output (4, 5), a switched-mode power supply (9) having two input connections (10, 11), by means of which it is arranged in parallel with the first filter capacitance (8) and between which it has a series circuit formed by a second inductance (12) and a switching device (13) which can be switched at a second frequency alternately into the conducting state and into the inhibited state, and from which switched-mode power supply the DC output voltage(s) (across 18, 19) can be output, as well as having a control capacitance (23) by means of which the junction point (22) between the first inductance (6) and the second rectifier arrangement (7) is coupled to the junction point (24) between the second inductance (12) and the switching device (13), the first inductance (6) and the control capacitance (23) being dimensioned in such a way that a resonant frequency determined thereby is greater than the second frequency and the latter is selected to be large with respect to the first frequency. As a result, both the voltage rise across the switching device and hence the high-frequency interference originating there and the harmonics of the mains current are reduced, in conjunction with a low component outlay.
