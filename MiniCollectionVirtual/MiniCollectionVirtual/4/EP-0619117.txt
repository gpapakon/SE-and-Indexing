<ABSTRACT>
The use of acemannan for the manufacture of a medicament 
for a vaccine adjuvant, for the production of a defective 

virus, for the treatment of an inflammatory bowel disease, 
for the correction of mucosal cell maturation syndromes, 

for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and for the correction 
of malabsorption. A method of producing a defective 

virus in master seed cultures for vaccine production comprising 
the addition of a pharmaceutically effective amount 

of acemannan to a master seed culture to produce altered 
viral replication.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns the use of acemannan, a biologically
active substance in the Aloe vera gel, for the preparation of
medicaments.Aloe vera is not a cactus plant, as widely
believed, but rather a member of the lily family. There are
about 360 Species of aloe plants known. Harding, Aloes of
the World: A Checklist, Index and Code, Excelsa9: 57 - 94
(1979). They seem to thrive in hot, arid areas and are
widely scattered from the Mediterranean Sea, Middle East,
Africa, China, Japan, Mexico and the southern U.S.A. A few
of the important species used for their medicinal properties
are Aloebarbadensis Miller (aloe vera), A.arborescens,
A.plicatilis, A.vahombe, A.saponaria, A.africana, A.ferox
and Aloeperryi. Reynolds, Aloes of Tropical Africa and
Madagascar, The Trustees, The Aloe Book Fund, Mbabane
Swaziland. However, A.barbadensis Miller is generally
recognized as the "true aloe" because of its wide use and,
reportedly, most effective healing power, although in Japan,
A.arborescens Miller traditionally has been used as a folk
remedy for various ailments ranging from gastrointestinal
disorders to athlete's foot.Aloe vera is a perennial plant with turgid green
leaves joined at the stem in a rosette pattern. The leaves
of a mature plant may be more than 25 inches long with saw-like
spikes along their margins.Slicing the leaf transversely as shown in Figures 1
and 2 reveals the outer walls of the epidermis (3) covered
with thick cuticles. Beneath the epidermis (3) is the
mesophyll which is differentiated into chlorenchymal cells
and thinner walled cells known as parenchyma. The parenchymal
cells harbor a transparent mucilaginous jelly (1). The
vascular bundles (2) with inner bundle sheath cells contain
the yellow sap, which has laxative properties, and are sandwiched
between the two major cells. Needle-shaped crystals
of calcium oxalate, produced as a metabolic by-product in
plant cells, are found mostly at the central portion of the
leaf. Aloe vera contains two major liquid sources, a
yellow latex (exudate) and the clear gel (mucilage). The
dried exudate of Aloebarbadensis Miller leaves is referred
to as aloe. The commercial name is Curacao aloe. It is
composed mainly of aloin, aloe-emodin and phenols. Bruce,
