<ABSTRACT>
A rock drill bit for hammer drilling machines is proposed, having a spiral shank and a drill head connected to it, on the end face of which a main cutting tip (6) inclined in a roof shape and secondary cutting tips (12, 13) arranged transversely to it are arranged. The drill head contains two laterally opposite flats for forming grooves for the cuttings. In plan view, the drill head is of rectangular configuration in cross-section to the greatest possible extent, an acute angle ss1 being enclosed between the main cutting tip and the lagging secondary cutting tips.

Rock drill for hammer drilling machines having a single-thread
or multi-thread discharge helix (3) and having a

drill head (2), which is formed from a circular cylindrical
drill head cross-section and on the end face (5) of which a

main cutting tip (6) is arranged, which is made of hard
metal or the like, extends over the entire diameter of the

drill head (2), is inclined in the shape of a roof in the
side view and has two cutting edges (7, 8), said main

cutting tip projecting radially beyond the circumferential
contour of the drill head (2), and said drill also having

auxiliary cutting tips arranged transversely to said main
cutting tip and made from one or more pieces, whereby a

rectangular or lozenge-like drill head (2) has two
opposing, substantially axially parallel, flattened side

flanks (15, 16) for the formation of drill dust grooves
(14, 27) and has the main cutting tip (6) and also the

auxiliary cutting tip (12, 13) passing approximately
diagonally through it, characterised in that an acute angle

β
1
 ≈ 60° to 90° is enclosed between the main cutting tip
(6) and the auxiliary cutting tips (12, 13), and that

opposing, possibly partially flattened, circular segment
portions (25, 26) are provided, which serve to embed or

support the main and/or auxiliary cutting tips (6, 12, 13)
on both sides.
Rock drill according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
main cutting tip (6) and preferably the auxiliary cutting

tips (12, 13) are supported and embedded in the drill head
(2) by their respective radially outer region at least one

their side surfaces lying on the opposite side to that on
which forces act.
Rock drill according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the side flanks (15, 16) have a length l
1
, which 
corresponds in each case to the distance l
2
 between the
side flanks (15, 16) (l
1
 ≈ l
2
).
Rock drill according to one of the preceding Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the angle between the leading main

cutting tip (6) and the trailing auxiliary cutting tips
(12, 13) amounts to β
1
 ≈ 75°.
Rock drill according to one of the preceding Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the outside diameter D of the main

cutting tip is larger than or equal to the outside diameter
d
3
 of the flush auxiliary cutting tip (12, 6) (D ≥ d
3
).
Rock drill according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
diameter d
3
 of the auxiliary cutting tips (12, 13)
corresponds approximately to the outside diameter d
1
 of the
drill head (2).
Rock drill according to one of the preceding Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the side flanks (15, 16) have a flat

or convexly arched (16') or concavely curved (16")
configuration for for
mation of the drill dust grooves (27).
Rock drill according to one of the preceding Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the auxiliary cutting tips (12, 13)

are in the form of individual tips which are roof-shaped in
broadside view, the radially outer regions (33) lying on

the same lateral area of a cone (35) as the cutting edges
(7, 8) of the main cutting tip (6).
Rock drill according to one of the preceding Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the wall thickness s
1
 of the main
cutting tip is constructed to be greater than the wall

thickness s
2
 of the auxiliary cutting tips. 
Rock drill according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
cross-section of the drill head has a lozenge-like shape,

whereby two opposing corners (41, 43) of the lozenge are
cut off or rounded off by the circumcircle d
1
 to form the
head diameter d
1
, and whereby preferably the vertical
longitudinal plane of symmetry (47) through the auxiliary

cutting tips (12, 13) passes through the cut-off lozenge
corners.
Rock drill according to Claim 10, characterised in that the
corner points (40, 42) of the transverse axis (44) of the

lozenge lie within the circumcircle formed by the outside
diameter d
1
 of the drill head.
Rock drill according to Claim 10 or 11, characterised in
that the drill head has two approximately axially parallel

side flanks (15', 16') for the formation of a main chip
space (27') in front of the main cutting tip (6) and two

likewise approximately axially parallel side flanks (37',
38') for the formation of auxiliary drill dust grooves (51,

52).
Rock drill according to one of the preceding Claims 10 to
12, characterised in that the main cutting tip (6) lies

with its entire width s
1
 completely inside a side surface
(40, 43 or 41, 42) of the lozenge, whereby laterally of the

main cutting tip and/or the auxiliary cutting tip the most
equal possible mass proportions of the drill head exist.
