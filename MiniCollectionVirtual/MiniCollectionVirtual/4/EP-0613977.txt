<ABSTRACT>
A process for printing and dyeing sheetlike fibre materials with anionic dyes comprises   a) first applying to the sheetlike fibre material an aqueous solution containing a fixing alkali and a compound which contains a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group or a quaternary ammonium group, which may each also be part of a heterocycle, by using a printing process, then b) subjecting the sheetlike fibre material to a fixing treatment to modify the sheetlike fibre material, and finally and optionally c) dyeing the modified sheetlike fibre material one or more times with a customary exhaust or padding method.

<CLAIMS>
A process for dyeing wovens or formed-loop knits
hydroxyl- and/or carboxamid-containing natural or

synthetic fiber materials with water-soluble
anionic dyes, which comprises


a) first applying to the sheetlike fiber material
an aqueous solution containing a fixing alkali

and a compound which contains a primary,
secondary or tertiary amino group or a

quaternary ammonium group by using the inkjet
printing process,
b) then subjecting the sheetlike fiber material to
a fixing treatment to modify the sheetlike fiber

material, and finally
c) dyeing the modified sheetlike fiber material by
a customary exhaust or padding method by using

anionic dyes.
The process of claim 1, wherein the fiber material
contains cellulose fibers.
The process of claim 1, wherein the fiber material
is cotton.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the dye is a fiber-reactive dye.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the alkali is sodium trichloroacetate, 

sodium formate, sodium citrate, sodium tartrate,
sodium oxalate, potassium fluoride or a mixture

thereof.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the compound with which the fiber material

is printed and modified is a compound of the
general formula (1) or (2)



where

M

The process of at least one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the compound with which the fiber material

is printed and modified is a compound of the
formula (3) or (4)



where

ER
is an ester group,
A and N
together with one or two alkylene groups of
1 to 4 carbon atoms form the bivalent

radical of a heterocyclic ring, wherein
A
is an oxygen atom or a group of the formula
(a), (b) or (c) 



where

R

is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon

atoms, which may be substituted by 1 or
2 substituents selected from the group

consisting of amino, sulfo, hydroxyl,
sulfato, phosphato and carboxyl, or is

an alkyl group of 3 to 8 carbon atoms,
