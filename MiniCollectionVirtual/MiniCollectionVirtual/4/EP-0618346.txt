<ABSTRACT>
Scale inhibitors are precipitated in a brine-containing 
formation by injecting an acidic solution comprising a dissolved 

scale inhibitor, a metal cation, a base-generating component and a 
chelating agent into the formation. The inhibitor is preferably a 

calcium salt of an organic nitrogen-containing phosphonic acid. The 
chelating agent prevents iron ions from causing premature 

hydrolysis of the base-generating component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for placing a scale 
inhibitor within a brine-containing subterranean formation in the 
vicinity of a producing wellbore. Slightly soluble inorganic salts, for example calcium carbonate, 
calcium sulphate, and barium sulphate, often precipitate from 
waters produced along with oil and gas. Such precipitation occurs 
because conditions that affect solubility, for example temperature 
and pressure, change, or because incompatible waters mix in, or 
near, producing well bores. Precipitates of slightly soluble salts 
are often called scale. Scale build up often occurs within the near 
wellbore formation and the wellbore equipment. Scale build-up 
within the formation decreases permeability and impairs well 
productivity. Scale build-up within wellbore equipment shortens 
equipment useful life and can plug production tubing. To minimize scaling, scale inhibitors can be placed within the 
formation by "squeeze" methods. Squeezing involves injecting the 
inhibitor and, usually, overflushing the treated zone with water or 
brine. The well is then placed back into production. Inhibitor in 
the produced waters protects the wellbore and downhole equipment 
from scale build-up. Squeezing inhibitor into the formation is typically a preferred 
way to apply an inhibitor. Squeeze injection eliminates any 
need for continuous injection, and the formation in the vicinity of 
the wellbore is protected. Most common scale inhibitors are 
effective in concentrations greater than about 1 to 100 parts per 
million. In a normal squeeze placement, it is difficult to control 
the concentration of inhibitor returning in produced brines. The 
inhibitors tend to be produced quickly, with concentrations quickly 
tailing off to ineffective amounts. This results in frequent 
shutdowns of production for squeezing operations, and also in 
excessive chemical costs.  
 Various attempts to control and delay inhibitor production 
have been only partially successful. For example, USA patent 
specification No. 3 483 925 discloses a method to provide a more 
gradual return of inhibitor by injection of the inhibitor with 
polymer-thickened slugs of solution. Injection of such thickened 
solutions would inhibit production of all fluids from the wellbore, 
and is therefore not a desirable method to provide a more gradual 
return of the inhibitor when production from the wellbore is 
desired. USA patent specifications No. 3 633 672 and No 3 704 750 
disclose inhibitors which are only slightly soluble in neutral

<CLAIMS>
A process for placing a scale inhibitor within a brine-containing 
subterranean formation in the vicinity of a producing 

wellbore comprising: 

providing an acidic aqueous solution comprising a dissolved 
scale inhibitor and a metal cation which combination is slightly 

soluble in the formation brine, a precursor which is capable of 
reacting within the formation to become a basic component and a 

chelating agent in an amount effective to prevent decomposition of 
the precursor upon contact with steel tubulars; 
injecting the acidic aqueous solution into the formation 
through the wellbore; and 
producing formation fluids from the wellbore after the 
precursor has generated an amount of basic material sufficient to 

cause an amount of the scale inhibitor and metal cation to precipitate 
within the formation that is effective to provide scale 

inhibition. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the concentration of the 
chelating agent in the acidic solution is between about 0.001 and 

about 0.05 moles per litre. 
The process of claim 1 or 2, wherein the chelating agent is 
selected from the group consisting of ethylene diamine tetraacetic 

acid, nitrilo triacetic acid and citric acid. 
The process of anyone of the claims 1-3, wherein the inhibitor 
comprises a nitrogen-containing phosphonic acid or a salt thereof. 
The process of claim 4, wherein the inhibitor comprises 
diethylenetriaminepenta(methylene phosphonic acid) or 

nitrilotri(methylene phosphonic acid) or a salt thereof. 
The process of claim 4 or 5, wherein the inhibitor comprises a 
calcium salt of the nitrogen-containing phosphonic acid. 
The process of anyone of the claims 1-6, wherein the precursor 
is a urea or an amide.  

 
The process of claim 7, wherein the precursor is selected from 
the group consisting of urea, formamide and dimethyl formamide. 
The process of anyone of the claims 1-8, wherein the injection 

of the acidic aqueous solution into the formation is followed by 
injection of an overflush fluid into the formation. 
The process of claim 9, wherein the injection of the overflush 
fluid is following by a period when fluids are neither injected nor 

produced for the wellbore.
