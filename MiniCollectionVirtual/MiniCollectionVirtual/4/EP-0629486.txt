<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system 
for thermoforming plate-like materials, including 

pre-heating stations (10,30), characterized in that the 
system comprises, downstream of a thermoplastic 

material plate automatic loader (1), a first pre-heating 
chamber (10), for heating a plate up to about 30% of 

the plasticizing end temperature thereof, a second 
pre-heating chamber (30) for heating the plate up to 

about 60% of the plasticizing temperature thereof, 
a plasticizing chamber (40) for performing the end heating 

of the plate to the plasticizing temperature 
thereof, and a vacuum forming chamber (50), as well as 

an unloading station (60). 
There are moreover provided conveyors for 
transferring step-by-step the plates through the 

system up to the unloading station (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system
for thermoforming plate-like materials, said system
including pre-heating stations.As is known, in conventional in-line thermoforming
apparatus, the thermoplastic material is
heated by a heating system including IR ceramic resistances.From DE-C-41 13 568 a device for thermoforming plate-like materials
is known, including heating stations, an automated loader
for automatically loading thermoplastic material plates, a vacuum-forming
chamber, an unloading station and conveyor means for transferring
step by step the plates being processed through said system
to the unloading station.It is also known, in conventional in-line thermoforming apparatus,
that the thermoplastic material is heated by a heating system including
IR ceramic resistances.In the case of polystyrene (HIPS) or acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene
resins (ABS) plates, having 
a thickness of about 4 mm, this type of heating
allows to increase very quickly the temperature of
the plates, i.e. from the room temperature to the
plasticizing temperature of said plates, in a period
of time less than 1 minute.By using a quick heating process, however,
there is at first consumed a comparatively high
amount of power and, moreover, since the IR heating
is a radiating type of heating, there occur great
losses of heat toward the outer environment, with
related great drawbacks.Moreover, by using a quick type of heating,
the thermoplastic material forming the plate is
mainly affected by the irradiated heat on its surface,
thereby the surface of the plate will have a 
temperature greater than the temperature at the core
portion of the plate, thereby providing an uneven
heating, that is an excessive surface heating and an
insufficient heating at the core of the plate.It should be apparent that this temperature
differential will in particular depend on the thickness
of the plate.An unevenly heated material, will be stretched
unevenly during the thermoforming thereof and,
more specifically, the surface regions will be much
more stretched than the core center, because of a
not proper thermoforming, with the generation of
great stresses which will remain in the thermoformed
piece for a long time.In particular, in the case in which the
formed pieces are drilled or cut, can occur deformations
thereof or size changes, since this operating
step will break the stressed fibres of the material
forming the thermoformed pieces.Similar problems occur as the thermoformed
pieces or panels are subjected to low temperatures,
such as, for
