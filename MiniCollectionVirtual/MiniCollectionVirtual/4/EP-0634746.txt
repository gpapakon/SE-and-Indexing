<ABSTRACT>
Pieces of leading compressed information, each of 
which corresponds to a predetermined number of blocks of 

each of a plurality of programs recorded on an optical 
disk (11), are successively read therefrom, and stored in a 

buffer memory (19) in a compressed state as they are. Upon 
reproducing a certain program, the corresponding leading 

compressed information is read from the buffer memory (19), and 
reproduced after having been subjected to a decompressing 

process in an information-decompression processing 
circuit (21). The program is continuously reproduced by 

reading compressed information corresponding to the 
predetermined number of blocks following the leading 

compressed information from the optical disk (1) and supplying 
the compressed information to the buffer memory (19). With 

this arrangement, it is possible to eliminate a slow 
switching operation in the case when programs are switched 

to start reproducing a different program.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention, which is applied to, for
example, information processing apparatuses, such as
magneto-optical reproduction apparatuses using
magneto-optical disks and compact-disk reproduction
apparatuses, relates to a method for making recordings on
a recording medium by dividing a plurality of different
pieces of digital information into a plurality of blocks
and compressing those blocks, and also relates to a
reproducing method for the recording medium.Conventionally, an optical-disk recording-reproduction 
apparatus has been used for recording and
reproducing, for example, digital audio information that
is digital information whose contents are consecutively
recorded.The optical-disk recording-reproduction apparatus has
a construction, for example, as illustrated in Fig. 14,
and conducts recording and reproduction. Upon recording,
analog audio information is inputted through an input
terminal 24, and converted into digital audio information
in an A/D converter 14. The digital audio information is
further converted into recording information in a
recording-data processing circuit 11 so as to become
suitable for recording, and is transmitted to a coil
driver 5. Then, the coil driver 5 drives a coil 4 so that
a modulated magnetic field corresponding to the recording
information is applied to an optical disk 1.Meanwhile, upon receipt of an instruction from a
controller 16, a laser driver 6 allows an optical pickup 3
to project a light beam of high power onto the optical
disk 1, and the temperature of the optical disk 1 is thus
raised locally so as to allow desired information to be
recorded thereon.Upon reproduction, after information of a target
recorded area has been extracted from a TOC memory 13, the
optical pickup 3 is allowed to access to the area in 
question. Thus, the information, which was recorded on
the optical disk 1, is read out by the optical pickup 3,
and directed to a reproduced-data processing circuit 12
through a reproduction amplifier 7.The reproduced-data processing circuit 12 converts
the inputted information into digital audio information,
and sends it to a D/A converter 15. The digital audio
information is converted into analog audio information in
the D/A converter 15, and released from an output terminal
25.Instructions as to the recording and reproduction are
entered through an operation section 17, and converted
into control signals for various sections in the
controller 16.Further, the current positional information and
operational state of the optical pickup 3 are
