<ABSTRACT>
A method for fabricating a perforated high temperature fiber reinforced polymer composite material which includes partially curing a polymer composite material to a viscoelastic state without inducing complete cure. The polymer composite material is formable when further heated, but does not experience excessive resin flow during final curing. According to the methods of the present invention, the polymer composite material may be perforated in the partially cured state, or prior to the partially cured state. A rigid pin mat apparatus of the present invention may advantageously be utilized to perforate the composite material. After the partial curing, the polymer composite material may be contoured utilizing a flexible mat pin apparatus of the present invention, or may be contoured utilizing forming tools generally known to the art. The method may advantageously be utilized with fiber-reinforced polymer composite starting materials, such as graphite/bismaleimide preimpregnated fabric, to produce perforated and contoured high temperature fiber reinforced polymer composite materials for sound suppression applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
High temperature resistant perforated polymer composite material and method for making sameFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to methods for fabricating perforated composites and composite laminates, that are capable of being contoured and able to withstand high temperatures to be used for sound suppression 5 applications. Also disclosed are flexible and rigid pin mat apparatuses that may be'utilized in fabricating perforated composites.BACKGROUND The phrase "fiber reinforced polymer composite 0 material" is generally utilized to describe a composite material that comprises a cured polymeric resin matrix that incorporates reinforcing fibers. The reinforcing fibers are generally incorporated in the form of a woven fiber mat.Perforated fiber reinforced polymer composites are 5 widely utilized as acoustic skins and sound suppression treatments. In particular, perforated fiber reinforced polymer composites are used in the sound suppression systems of aircraft engine nacelles. High temperature polymer composite materials are generally necessary for the inner 0 cowl bondment of a jet engine fan reverser, which is subjected to high temperatures during combustion. Often the acoustic skins and sound suppression treatments require shaping or contouring the high temperature polymer composite material to fit the shape of the engine nacelle. 5 Graphite fiber/bismaleimide preimpregnated fabric is a commercially available fiber reinforced polymer composite material that is able to withstand the high temperature environment of aircraft engine nacelles. Existing methods for fabricating perforated acoustic skins and treatments are 0 not suitable for forming perforated graphite fiber/bismaleimide preimpregnated polymer fabric composites, or composite laminates, due to the high temperature capability and toughness of graphite fiber/bismaleimide 

preimpregnated fabric. Processing by existing methods leads to extensive fiber damage, gross porosity, delamination and matrix cracking, with a subsequent loss in mechanical and acoustic performance. Additionally, the flexible pin mats are often not capable of withstanding the high temperatures necessary to cure the resins used in the composites.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have discovered^ methods for producing perforated high temperature fiber reinforced polymer composite materials, and laminates, that overcome the deficiencies of existing methods. As used herein, "high temperature fiber reinforced polymer composite material" is used to describe fiber reinforced

CLAIMS
1. A method for fabricating a perforated composite material comprising the steps of: curing a preimpregnated starting material, at sufficient temperature and pressure, to a semi-cured viscoelastic state wherein the material may be formed upon further heating but will not yield substantial resin flow upon final cure; perforating the semi-cured material to form an array of orifices; and curing the perforated material at a temperature and pressure sufficient to final cure.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising contouring the perforated semi-cured material prior to final cure.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the semi-cured laminate is perforated by drilling and facilitated via a multispindle compaction head.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the starting material is fiber reinforced.
5. The method of claim 4 wherein the starting material is a graphite/bismaleimide preimpregnated fabric. 

6. A method for fabricating a perforated polymer composite material for high temperature sound suppression applications comprising the steps of: pressing a first rigid sheet having an array of rigid pin like projections through a preimpregnated starting material to perforate the starting material; placing a second sheet, having an array of orifices arranged in the same manner as the array of rigid pin like projections on the first sheet over the preimpregnated starting material to sandwich the starting material between the first and second sheets; curing the resulting assembly, at sufficient temperature and pressure, to a semi-cured viscoelastic state wherein the material may be formed upon further heating but will not yield substantial resin flow upon final cure; removing the first and second sheets; and curing the perforated material at a temperature and pressure sufficient to final cure.
7. The method of claim 6 further comprising contouring the perforated semi-cured material prior to final cure. 

8. A method for producing a perforated and contoured composite material comprising the steps of: curing a preimpregnated starting material, at sufficient temperature and pressure, to a semi-cured viscoelastic state wherein the material may be formed upon further heating but will not yield substantial resin flow upon final cure; perforating the semi-cured material to form an array of orifices; placing the semi-cured material onto a first flexible sheet having an array of pin-like projections arranged in the same pattern as the array of perforations; placing a second flexible sheet having an array of orifices arranged in the same pattern as the perforations and the pin-like projections over the semi-cured material to sandwich the semi-cured material between the first and second sheets; contouring the resulting assembly; subjecting the assembly to sufficient temperature and pressure to induce final curing of the semi-cured material; and removing the first and second flexible sheets.
