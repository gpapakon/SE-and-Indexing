<ABSTRACT>
Closures are known, which only permit the contents of the container to be squeezed out in an unsatisfactory manner and are furthermore of relatively complex design and therefore expensive to manufacture. The object of the invention, in addition to cost-effective manufacture, is also to permit the contents to be squeezed out of the container in an optimum manner. For this purpose, provision is made for the lid part (5) to consist of a material of high elasticity and to be firmly connected to a supporting body (4) which is formed from a material of less elasticity and is otherwise joined to the neck of the bottle (1) or to the closure (2).

<CLAIMS>
A container for liquid or pasty content having a closure which is
loaded by and held closed by a spring (67), wherein the spring loading is

of such a magnitude that it yields and allows the closure to open when a
pressure is applied to the container content, and wherein the closure

comprises two oppositely disposed flaps (59) which are pivotably mounted
to mutually oppositely arranged sides (60) and have a common closing join,

characterised in that a support (62) of bar-like form for the flaps is
arranged under the common closing join of the two flaps (59).
A container according to claim 1 characterised in that fixed
under the flaps (59) are flexible, preferably resilient arms (64) which

extend into the container neck (51) and whose free ends are connected to a
spring (67) which for example is in the form of a W-shaped leaf or bar

spring and which in turn is fixed to the container neck.
A container according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that
the spring (67) is in the form of a straight leaf spring or a coil spring,

it is arranged in a diametral position under the container neck (51) and
it is anchored with its ends and connected in its centre to the arms (64)

on the flaps (59).
