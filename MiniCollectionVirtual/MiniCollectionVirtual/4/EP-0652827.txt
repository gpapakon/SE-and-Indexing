<ABSTRACT>
A light admitting thermal insulating structure (10) having controllable transmissivity to visible radiation (11) comprises a first layer (15) generally transparent to light, a second layer (17) generally transparent or absorptive to light and spaced from the first layer; an improved partition means separates the space between the layers into compartments; a thermal radiation suppression device (16) for suppressing thermal radiation transmission; and a variable transparency device (18) for controlling transmission of light. A suitable partition includes a novel convection baffle which transmits light and thermal radiation which improves the thermal resistance and/or reduces the cost of low emissivity layers (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved light
admitting thermal insulating structure which prevents heat
loss by thermal radiation, convection and conduction,
including controllable transmission and/or reflection
and/or absorption to light, and a convection baffle which
transmits light and thermal radiation or "CBTLTR" to
prevent convection loss.Conventional collectors of solar heat include a dark
absorber surface that turns sunlight into heat and a
transparent cover for this surface to prevent the heat from
escaping. The thermal collection efficiency of such a
system is determined by the ratio of the resistance to the
flow of heat of the transparent cover to the resistance of
the rest of the system. By increasing the thermal
resistance of the transparent cover without greatly
reducing its light transmission, the efficiency and/or
operating temperature of the solar heat collector can be
greatly improved. It is estimated that two or three times
the energy consumed in heating a well insulated building
falls on its surface in the form of sunlight. Thus, an
insulation that is transparent when the sun shines would
provide most of the heating for a structure over most of
the United States if it is coupled with a heat storage
system for cloudy weather.In the past the problems of heat loss through
conduction, convection and thermal radiation (also called
far infrared radiation) and control of sunlight have been
dealt with independently. For example, convection and
conduction losses are reduced using spaces filled with some
fine structural material without consideration of admission
of sunlight. Further, sunlight has been blocked using 
coatings of layers on windows to prevent room overheating
but without consideration of a technique for admitting more
sunlight when it is desired to increase the heat in the
room. Thermal radiation loss has been of little concern
since in the latter situation heat loss is desirable and in
the former it is not considered.Since the heat losses by conduction, convection and
radiation are in parallel to each other and are of similar
magnitudes, an insulation is ineffective unless all three
are dealt with simultaneously, as heat will leave by the
path of least resistance.To best understand the invention, reference is made to 4

Edition, McGraw Hill (1989) for a general definition of
terms. Specifically, reference is made to Solar Optical
