<ABSTRACT>
A discharge lamp (36) having a lamp envelope (10) with at 
least one sealed end (16,17) which is disposed in the base 

member (28) of the discharge lamp (36) includes an excitation 
arrangement capable to emit light output upon 

sufficient energization, an energization arrangement (34) 
disposed in the base member (28) sufficient to excite the 

lamp envelope (10). The sealed end (16,17) of the lamp envelope (10) has 
a roughened texture (25,26) disposed around a substantial 

portion thereof. The texturized region is grit blasted 
and structurally weaker than the remaining portion of 

the lamp envelope (10). At least one sealed end (16,17) of the lamp 
envelope (10) is texturized and is effective so as to: shut 

down the discharge lamp (36) upon the possible occurrence of 
a high temperature condition and, upon shut down, 

substantially maintain the envelope fill material 
within the lamp envelope (10) and base member (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a discharge lamp having 
a lamp envelope with a textured seal region. More 
particularly, this invention relates to such a lamp 
envelope as exhibits a textured sealed region which 
controls lamp failure in the event of an excessive 
temperature condition while benefiting the environment 
by allowing containment of the envelope fill within the 
base member of the discharge lamp under certain 
excessive temperature conditions. The designs of compact fluorescent lamps have as 
their principle aim the obtainment of significant 
energy savings over the use of incandescent lamps while 
attaining a comparable level of light output. It is 
also a significant advantage that such compact 
fluorescent lamps have a considerably longer life than 
a conventional incandescent lamp. With most of such fluorescent or low pressure 
discharge lamp devices, it is necessary to provide a 
ballasting circuit to perform the function of 
conditioning the current signal used to drive the 
discharge lamp. An example of a compact fluorescent 
lamp utilizing a typical ballasting circuit can be 
found in U.S. Patent No. 4,481,442 issued on Nov. 6, 
1984, to Wolfgang Albrecht et al. It will be noted 
that the compact fluorescent lamp described in this 
patent consists of a bent discharge envelope which 
contains mercury gas. Furthermore, it will be noted 
that the ballasting circuit described in this patent  
 
relies on an electromagnetic type of ballasting; that 
is, one that requires the use of a magnetic core 
transformer to condition the current signal. Because 
such a ballasting arrangement operates at a power line 
current frequency of 60 Hz which can result in lamp 
flicker, it has been determined that an electronic high 
frequency ballast that would eliminate the occurrence 
of lamp flicker or light variation, would be 
preferable. An example of a high frequency electronic 
ballast arrangement for a gas discharge lamp can be 
found in EP-A-534728 and in EP-A-534727. It will be noted that the ballast arrangement is 
typically housed in a base member, and that such base 
member can have an upper cap portion which surrounds 
pinched seals of the outer ends of the tubular 
discharge envelope. Though this arrangement has proven 
to be simple and reliable when used with lower 
frequency circuits, it may be necessary to utilize 
additional housing/lamp envelope configurations when a 
high frequency electronic ballast circuit is utilized. 
For instance, with the higher frequency electronic 
ballast

A fluorescent discharge lamp comprising: 

a multi-axis glass lamp envelope (10) having at least one sealed 
end (16, 17); 
a base member (28) in which said at least one sealed end 
(16, 17) is disposed; 
and a lamp fill disposed in said lamp envelope (10), operable so 
as to emit light output when energized; characterized by: 
said sealed end (16, 17) of said lamp envelope (10) having a 
roughened texture (25, 26) disposed around a substantial portion thereof 

and located in said base member (28), the roughened sealed end being 
selectively structurally flawed by said roughened texture (25, 26) relative to 

the remaining portion of said lamp envelope (10); so that upon the 
occurrence of a temperature condition in excess of a predetermined value, 

said roughened sealed end (25, 26) fails in a controlled manner and said fill is 
contained in said base member (28). 
The discharge lamp as set forth in claim 1, wherein the 
discharge lamp is a compact lamp and further comprises means 

(19, 20, 34) for energizing said lamp fill, said energizing means (19, 20, 34) 
being disposed in said base member (28). 
The discharge lamp as set forth in claim 1, wherein said lamp 
envelope (10) and said base member (28) are configured so as to be 

insertable in a fixture having a socket adapter (38) associated therewith.

is a mercury and gas fill.

roughened sealed end (25, 26). 
A method of manufacturing a fluorescent discharge lamp having a multi-axis 
glass lamp envelope (10) connected to a base member (28), comprising the

blowing gas into the lamp envelope (10) through ends thereof to

envelope (10); 
inserting an energizing system (19, 20, 34) into the base 
member (28); 
heating the lamp envelope ends (16, 17) to softening 
temperature and subsequent pinch-sealing of the ends (16, 17) about 

electrode members (19, 20) which extend into the base member (28);
