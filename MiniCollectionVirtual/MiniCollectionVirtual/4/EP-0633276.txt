<ABSTRACT>
In the production of mouldings and fillings made from rigid and flexible polyurethane foams and rigid polyurethane foams containing isocyanurate structures made from polyol and isocyanate and activator and optionally further additives, flaws in the foam can be avoided by increasing the amount of activator during the preparation of the reaction mixture - considered over time - to give a setting time which commences simultaneously everywhere as far as possible.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of mouldings and fillings
from rigid and flexible polyurethane foams and rigid

polyurethane foams having isocyanurate structures by
reacting compounds containing at least two isocyanatereactive

hydrogen atoms, in the presence of water, an
activator or mixture of activators and readily

volatile organic substances as blowing agents,
optionally together with foam stabilisers, flame

retardants, with polyisocyanates, which pass together
through a mixing chamber and wherein the foaming

reaction mixture is subjected to a fibre time and
cures, characterised in that the activator is added in

a quantity rising with time to the reaction mixture in
the mixing chamber or to the polyol shortly upstream

from the mixing chamber in such a manner as to ensure
that the fibre time begins as far as possible

simultaneously everywhere.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the reaction mixture is produced in a single shot.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the reaction mixture is produced in two or more shots,

wherein the proportion of activator is increased from
shot to shot.
Process according to claim 1 or 3, characterised in
that the reaction mixture is produced in two or more

shots and the proportion of activator is increased
from shot to shot and is additionally raised during at

least one shot.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that the increase in the quantity of
activator is program-controlled. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that the polyisocyanate is a
polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate having a

monomer content of 25 to 70 wt.%.
