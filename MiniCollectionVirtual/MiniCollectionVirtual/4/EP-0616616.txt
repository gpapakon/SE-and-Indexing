<DESCRIPTION>
Multiple sequential chemical reactions on a polymeric feedstock are carried out in an extruder with multiple reaction
zones. Each reaction zone has means for introduction of reagents, for mixing of reagents with polymer and for removal
of by/co-products or unreacted reagents.Graft reaction via melt processing equipment such as single or multiple screw extruders, rubber masticators, Banbury
processors, Brabender processors, roll-mills and the like, includes well-known technology and is widely reported
in the technical literature. Similarly, post-graft reactions with the graft polymers are also widely reported. Thus, the graft
reaction of unsaturated carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid derivatives with thermoplastic polymers capable of subsequent
chemical reaction for use in such as lubricating oil compositions or thermoplastic blend compositions has become
an important field of ongoing development. The following patent art addresses such graft reactions, particularly one
suitable for the preparation of lubricating oil additives.U.S. Patent 3,862,265 addresses degradation in molecular weight to achieve narrow molecular weight distribution,
and optional free-radical initiated graft reaction of unsaturated monomers with, for example, ethylene-propylene copolymer
by use of melt processing procedures in an extruder reactor. Intensive mixing of free radical initiator and graft
reactants with molten polymers is achieved by the use of either decompression zones or thin film zones in the extruder.
An additional suggestion for product quality improvement is that of capping the reaction zone to prevent escape of
gaseous reactants, and accompanying that with subsequent venting under reduced pressure to remove vaporous
components. The suggestion is further given that subsequent reaction in the extruder can modify the graft-monomer-containing
polymers, specifically such subsequent reactions as those of esterification, neutralization, amidization and
imidization.U.S. Patent 4,320,019 describes the preparation of lubricating oil additives that are reaction products of interpolymers,
of ethylene, C3-C8 alpha olefins, and polyenes that are first reacted in an oil solution with olefinic carboxylic
acid compositions, and then with an amine. The reaction of the interpolymer with the acid compositions are conducted
at temperatures and conditions designed to avoid molecular weight degradation. It is said that unreacted materials can
be removed by vacuum stripping from the oil solution. The reaction with amine is generally
