<ABSTRACT>
An image processing apparatus having a function for 
rotating image data stored in a memory by 90° while 

preventing deterioration of image quality. Upon image 
reading, if the line density in a subscanning direction 

is lower than the pixel density in a main-scanning 
direction, the line density is raised close to the pixel 

density. The reading control is performed in accordance 
with possibility of 90° rotation of image in a 

destination apparatus or a specific size of an original 
image. This attains efficient use of image memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processing
apparatus having a plurality of resolutions.Document GB-A-2 153 621 shows an image processor
adapted to write a transformed image in a second memory and
original image data in a first memory. The image processor
is equipped with an address converter for sequentially
outputting a number of converted address data in the
vicinity of each original address data output from an
address generator, and processing means for performing a
prescribed operation, e.g. averaging on original image data
read out on the basis of the thus-converted address data.
The address conversion brings about the required
transformation, e.g. rotation or reduction.Other conventional image processing apparatuses,
having a function for rotating information stored in a
memory by a right angle (hereinafter referred to as "90°
rotation function"), read an image in a mode specified from
an operation unit and store the read image data into the
memory. Such reading modes are usually called "normal
mode", "fine mode" and "super-fine mode". The resolution of
the normal mode is 8 pel/mm x 3.85 line/mm; that of the
fine mode 8 pel/mm x 7.7 line/mm; and that of the
super-fine mode 8 pel/mm x 15.41 line/mm (pel/mm: density
in main-scanning direction; line/mm: density in subscanning 
direction). When the conventional apparatus reads an image
in the normal mode, it stores the read image data having 8
pel/mm x 3.85 line/mm resolution into a memory. Problems is
that if a 90° rotation is performed on the stored image
data, the line density of the rotated data in the
main-scanning direction is degraded to 3.85 pel/mm. The
conventional art converts the degraded line density into 8
pel/mm so as to raise the resolution, however,
deterioration of image quality cannot be avoided.The present invention has been made in consideration
of the above situation, and has as its object to provide an
image processing apparatus capable of preventing
deterioration of image quality.It is another object of the present invention to
provide an image processing apparatus capable of
efficiently utilizing an image memory.According to the present invention, the forgoing
objects are attained by providing an image processing
apparatus and method as outlined in the attached claims.Other features and advantages of the present invention
will be apparent from the following 
description taken in conjunction with the accompanying
drawings, in which like reference characters designate
the same or similar parts throughout the figures
