<ABSTRACT>
Implantable cardiac pacemaker with frequency slaved to a parameter representative of the physical activity of the person in whom it is implanted. The profile of the stimulation rate follows, so as to reproduce the profile of the physiological cardiac frequency, a mathematical function of the type:  Fc(t)=A*(1-B*exp(-t/Tau))+C.

<CLAIMS>
An implantable cardiac pacemaker having a frequency controlled by at
least one parameter representative of the physical activity of the wearer, wherein the

change of the stimulation frequency follows, in a manner to reproduce the change of
the physiological cardiac rhythm, a mathematical function Fc(t), characterised in

that:

Fc(t) = A * (1 - B * e
-t/Tau
) + C,

where

Fc(t) is the cardiac frequency delivered by the pacemaker as a function of
time,
t is the parameter of time, and A, B, C, and Tau are constants.
The pacemaker as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said
mathematical function is approached by a limited expansion.
The pacemaker as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the
mathematical function is :


Fc(t)=K - (Tau/t)
The pacemaker as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said
mathematical function is :


Fc(t) = (Fstart - Ftarget) e
-t/Tau_inc
 + Ftarget
, to control the increase of
the stimulation frequency, and
Fc(t) = (Fstart - Ftarget) e
-t/Tau_dec
 + Ftarget
, to control the decrease of
the stimulated rhythm, where:
Fstart is the cardiac frequency from which the increase or the
decrease of the stimulated rhythm begins,
Ftarget is the cardiac frequency that has to be reached and which is
calculated on the basis of the value of one or more control parameters of the

pacemaker,
Tau_inc is a control parameter of the increase of the stimulated
rhythm from Fstart to Ftarget, 
Tau_dec is a control parameter of the decrease of the stimulated
rhythm from Fstart to Ftarget.
The pacemaker as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that said
mathematical function is transformed to be applied at cardiac expulsion intervals and

to authorise the calculation of the next expulsion interval by adding the following
variation to the current expulsion interval:


dTc(t) =Tc
3
(t) * [Fc(t) - Ftarget] / Tau, where
Tc(t) = 1/Fc(t);
Tau=Tau_inc
, for an increasing frequency,
Tau=Tau_dec
, for a decreasing frequency.
The pacemaker as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that the variation
dTc(t) is not systematically added to each expulsion interval but to an expulsion

interval out of a variable number (MULT) of expulsion intervals.
The pacemaker as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that in order to
apply said variation dTc(t) on an expulsion interval out of a variable number

(MULT) of expulsion intervals, said variation is calculated as follows :

dTc(t) =Rounded (MULT * Tc
3
(t) * [ Fc(t) - Ftarget]/Tau)
, where the
factor MULT is obtained by an algorithm.
The pacemaker as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that the
factor MULT:


is incremented when said variation applied on the preceding
expulsion interval is zero,
is reset to 1 as soon as the variation is non zero,
is reset to 1 if 
Fc=Ftarget
.
The pacemaker as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that the authorised
variation of the cardiac frequency from one cycle to the following is limited to a

maximal value, preferably equal to 6min
-1
.
