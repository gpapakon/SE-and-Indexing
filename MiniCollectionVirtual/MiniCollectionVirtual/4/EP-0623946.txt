<ABSTRACT>
In the low-pressure sodium discharge lamp the current conductors (3) 
have a first (4) and a second glass coating (6). The first coating (5) of borate glass 

extends from inside the discharge vessel (1) through a pinch seal (4). The second 
coating (6) of lime glass envelopes the first one (5) within the pinch seal (4) and extends 

to outside the discharge vessel (4). The occurrence of cracks in the pinch seal is thereby 
obviated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a low-pressure sodium discharge lamp 
comprising: 
a discharge vessel which is sealed in a vacuumtight manner and has a 
filling comprising sodium and rare gas;  electrodes arranged in the discharge vessel and each connected to at least 
one respective current conductor which issues to the exterior through a respective 
pinched seal, wherein the current conductors each have a first coating of borate glass 
which extends from within the relevant pinched seal to inside the discharge vessel, and 
in contact with said coating a second, lime glass coating which extends to outside the 
discharge vessel;  and evacuated outer bulb which is provided with an IR reflection filter and 
which surrounds the discharge vessel.   Such a low-pressure sodium discharge lamp is known from US-A-4,783,612. In the known lamp, the coatings have a butt joint which lies inside the 
relevant pinched seal. 
The first coating is resistant to sodium. This coating protects the current conductors 
against electric contact with liquid or solid sodium which could deposit against the 
pinched seal. The discharge arc could apply itself to the sodium if the coating were 
absent, which would lead to violent reactions and damage to the current conductor and 
the pinched seal. 
The second coating is thicker than the first one and absorbs forces which result from the 
difference between the coefficients of thermal expansion of the discharge vessel and the 
current conductors. The construction of the known lamp was found to be reliable in the case 
of operation at mains frequency. With high-frequency operation, however, cracks arise  
 
in the pinched seal after a few thousand hours already, leading to lamp leaks and thus to 
the end of lamp life. It is an object of the invention to provide a low-pressure sodium discharge 
lamp of the kind described in the opening paragraph which is of a construction which is 
reliable also in the case of high-frequency operation. According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the first coating 
extends through the entire pinched seal and is enveloped by the second coating in the 
pinched seal. It is assumed that the damage to the known lamp operated at high 
frequency is caused by the higher electrical resistance which the current conductors 
have upon high-frequency operation, because they conduct the current substantially only 
along their surfaces in that case. The current conductors and the pinch then assume 
higher temperatures. It was a surprise to find that the lamp
