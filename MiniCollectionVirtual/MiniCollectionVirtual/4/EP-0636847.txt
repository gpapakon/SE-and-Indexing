<ABSTRACT>
The outlet end (9) of a rotary drum furnace (8) for the heat treatment of free-flowing materials, in particular bulk materials, is essentially subjected to stresses which occur simultaneously and in different proportions. Various embodiments of the outlet end (9) of rotary drum furnaces (8) are therefore known from practice, where it has proved to be particularly successful to design the outlet end (9) in the form of a double casing, its closure being formed by outlet-protection segmental parts (11, 12, 13). In order to meet increased demands, in particular with regard to a higher thermal loading capacity, it is proposed according to the invention to construct the outlet-protection segmental parts (11, 12, 13) in several pieces and to design the segmental parts in such a way that they can be releasably connected to one another free of stress in the form of push-in connections so that a largely gastight and dustproof closure of the double casing is achieved.

A rotary furnace for the heat treatment of flowable materials,
especially bulk materials, with a rotary furnace casing (16), which

ends at a distance from the outflow edge of the rotary furnace and
which is formed at its outflow end as a double casing, to which on

the outside at the outflow end of the rotary furnace brackets (15)
are fastened, bearing out and equally distributed around the

circumference of the rotary furnace casing (16), onto which
outflow protection segments are arranged, which form the

termination of this double casing and the outflow edge of the
rotary furnace, 
characterised in that
 the largely gas and dust tight
closure of the outflow protection segments forming the double

casing is stormed from outflow protection segment components
(11, 11', 12, 12', 13), which are slotted together into each other

and toothed in the axial and circumferential directions of the rotary
furnace casing (16) to bind stress-free and removably between

each other and with the brackets (15).
A rotary furnace according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
outflow protection segment components (10, 11, 11', 12, 12', 13)

are manufactured from heat resistant and abrasion resistant
ceramic materials, which belong to the group of the non-metallic

hard materials.
A rotary furnace according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 outflow protection segment components (10, 11, 11', 12,
12', 13) of different materials are combined with each other into

outflow protection segments.
