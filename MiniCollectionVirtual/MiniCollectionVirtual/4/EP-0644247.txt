<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to laminate structures comprising a 
polymeric film that is bonded to a substrate layer. Polyvinyl acetate and acrylic-based emulsions are used extensively 
in adhesives in many applications, including furniture construction, 
vinyl laminating, pressure sensitive adhesives, consumer glues and food 
packaging. One major area of interest is film laminates. Such 
multi layer film constructions are used to package foods and consumer 
products and offer a combination of properties not obtainable with a 
single product. Often paper is used for mechanical strength and is 
bonded to a plastic film to give a packaging material which has improved 
water resistance. Joining dissimilar films can be accomplished in several way; one 
is by coextrusion of two or more thermoplastic materials. Laminating 
films as they exit the extruder gives a multi layer film which has good 
mechanical integrity, as long as the materials are not too dissimilar 
chemically. Films which have markedly different surface energies may 
not have sufficient adhesion to hold together. Often adhesive tie 
layers are used to improve layer to layer adhesion. An alternate method of construction is the use of adhesives to 
laminate films together. Aqueous vinyl acetate-based and acrylic-based 
polymer emulsions are commonly used to bond porous substrates, such as 
paper, to plastic films including polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene 
terephthalate, polyethylene, polypropylene and the like. Such emulsions 
have the required properties of wet tack, adhesive strength and 
runnability to be used in high speed laminating lines. Often the adhesive strength between the two films of interest is 
insufficient for the required end use. In such cases, it is common to 
use an adhesion promoter to improve the adhesive strength. One compound 
in current use as an adhesion promoter is polyethylenimine (PEI). 
Addition of PEI at 0.5 to 2% of the polymer weight in the emulsion  
 
commonly gives improved adhesion on low surface energy films. Such 
adhesion is commonly measured by the T-peel test. Representative of art teaching the use of polyalkylenimine resins 
such as PEI resins in film laminates include the following: U.S. 2,828,237; 3,033,707; 3,096,602; 3,140,196; 3,230,135 and 
3,361,586. JP4-264182 discloses a wood adhesive composition comprising a 
polyvinyl alcohol A, a filler B and a waterproofing agent C; each 
molecule of the polyvinyl alcohol containing at least one type of 
functional group selected from among primary amino
