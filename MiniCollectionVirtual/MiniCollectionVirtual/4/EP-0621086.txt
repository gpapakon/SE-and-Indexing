<ABSTRACT>
A process for the environmentally safe disposal of used 
fluorescent lamp potted ballast assemblies and the like, 

with the potential for component part reclamation and/or 
recycling, involving preferred cryogenic freezing of the 

potted assembly to the extent that the frozen potting 
becomes sufficiently brittle throughout to enable it to be 

pulverized away in small particles, cleanly from all the 
components, with only that component with a hazardous 

material needing to be incinerated or otherwise 
environmentally safely disposed of, and with all the other 

components and parts in condition for salvage, re-use, 
and/or reclamation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for 
disposing of composite potted electrical component 
assemblies and the like with environmental safety and cost 
efficiency, and with safe component and part reclamation 
and/or recycling where desired, being more particularly 
concerned with used fluorescent light ballast assemblies 
often containing only select components, such as capacitors, 
with environmentally hazardous constituents such as pcb's 
(polychlorinated biphenyls) and the like. The problem of disposing of used fluorescent light 
ballast assemblies has plagued commercial and other 
institutions for some years, particularly in view of 
relatively recent state and federal regulations governing 
perpetual legal responsibility for their disposal and the  
 
environmental safety of the waste products of such disposal. The concomitant problem of enabling conservation or 
salvaging of those valuable components and materials not 
presenting hazard difficulties by reclamation and reuse, 
refurbishing and/or recycling of the valuable materials 
therein (metals, wires and windings, plastics, etc.) often 
must be ignored in the light of this perpetual environmental 
safety responsibility, loading to expensive incineration or 
other blanket waste of the total products as in land fill, 
etc., just because hazards may exist only in limited parts 
thereof. It is just such a circumstance that exists with used 
fluorescent light ballasts containing potted assemblies of 
electrical components and the like embedded in the patting 
and wherein only a very small weight or volume percentage of 
the product may involve highly environmentally hazardous 
materials; the remainder or bulk of the product, however, 
being admirably suited for valuable reclamation and/or 
recycling, leading none-the-less to the current-day practice 
of wasting the whole opportunity for such reclamation and/or  
 
recycling in incinerating or breaking up and/or burying the 
complete product just because, for example, the capacitor 
component thereof may contain the before-mentioned hazardous 
pcb's or the like. It is an object of the present invention, accordingly, 
to provide a now and improved process for the disposal of 
such used potted ballasts and the like that provides totally 
adequate security and low cost efficiency for the perpetual 
environmental safety in the disposal of the potentially 
hazardous component or materials thereof, while 
simultaneously enabling safe and substantially pristine 
condition reclamation and/or
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for the environmentally safe and economical 
disposal of used fluorescent lamp potted ballast 

housing assemblies and the like, that comprises, 
removing from the housing the potted assembly with 

its embedded electrical component assembles 
including a component such as a capacitor containing 

environmentally hazardous material such as pcb's; 
after or before such removing, immersing the potted 

assembly in a cryogenic bath and freezing the same 
to the extent of rendering the potting sufficiently 

brittle to fragment into small pieces upon being 
impacted; impacting the potting thoroughly to crush 

and fragment the same into such small pieces and 
cleanly to remove substantially all traces of the 

potting from all the electrical components and parts 
embedded therein and without imparting damage to 

said components and parts; disconnecting the said 
component containing the environmentally hazardous 

material; and incinerating only the said component 
 

containing the environmentally hazardous material, 
leaving all other components and parts including 

said housing and potting fragments for salvage, 
re-use and/or recycling as desired and appropriate. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which the said 
other components and parts comprise wires, different 

metal parts, a transformer and a starter which are 
disassembled and separated by different metals, 

wires, and similar part materials for independent 
recycling. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which said 
potting is of an asphalt-tar type and the cryogenic 

freezing is effected over the complete potted 
assembly to ensure that the core of the assembly 

achieves a temperature of about -50Â°F to attain 
sufficient brittleness to enable small impact 

fragmentation of potting particles and substantially 
total removal of potting particles from the 

electrical components and parts once embedded 
therein. 
A process for the environmentally and safe and 
economical disposal of used potted assemblies 

containing embedded electric components and parts 
including one or more components containing 

environmentally hazardous material, that comprises, 
immersing the potted assembly in a cryogenic bath 

and freezing the same to the adequate extent of 
rendering the potting sufficiently brittle to 

fragment into fine pieces upon being impacted; 
impacting the frozen brittle potting thoroughly to 

crush and fragment the same into such small pieces 
and cleanly to remove substantially all traces of 

the potting from all the electrical components and 
parts embedded therein and without imparting 

substantial damage to said components and parts; 
disconnecting the said one or more components 

containing environmentally hazardous material; and 
incinerating or burying only such one or more 

components, leaving all the other components and 
parts including the potting fragments for recycling 

 
and/or salvage as desired and appropriate. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which said 
impacting is effected by one or more of hammering, 

roll-crushing and compactor impacting. 
A process for the environmentally and safe and 
economical disposal of used potted assemblies 

containing embedded electric components and parts 
including one or more containing 

environmentally hazardous material, that comprises, 
immersing the potted assembly in a cryogenic bath 

and freezing the same to the adequate extent of 
rendering the potting sufficiently brittle to 

fragment into fine pieces upon being impacted; 
impacting the frozen brittle potting thoroughly to 

crush and fragment the same into such small pieces 
and cleanly to remove substantially all traces of 

the potting from all the electrical components and 
parts embedded therein and without imparting 

substantial damage to said components and parts; before or 
after said freezing, seperating the said one or more 

components or parts containing enviromentally hazardous 
material; and incinerating or burying only such one or 

more components or parts, leaving all the other components 
and parts including the potting fragments for recycling 

and/or salvage as and if desired and appropriate.
