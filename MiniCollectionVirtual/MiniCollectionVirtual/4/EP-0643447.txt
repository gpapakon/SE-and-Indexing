<ABSTRACT>
The contacts of an electrical connector are joined 
by the biasing force of the contact elements and in 

practice are separated by a tool to interconnect 
therebetween an additional circuit member. A probe (11) 

which has a terminal end (17) to cause the wiping of 
the contact elements (28, 29) against each other at 

the interface during insertion or removal of the 
probe will improve contact and extend the life of the 

contact elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to a terminal end for a 
probe used to interrupt a circuit, introduce a parallel 
or series circuit; as used on an overload protector, a 
test access device, a patch cord or other electronic 
device; between pairs of contact elements, particularly 
in a telecommunication cross connect block and in one 
aspect to a terminal end affording the separation and 
remating of spring biased contact elements to cause the 
same to wipe against each other upon insertion and 
removal of the probe. Termination and distribution connectors have been 
in use in the communications industry for a long time 
to afford rapid connection of distribution wires to a 
pair of wires of an incoming or outgoing cable. The 
systems are built for use with pairs of wires. Wire 
pairs are joined to at least one other pair to perfect 
the transmission. Also, it is very necessary that the 
splice between one pair and the other pair be readily 
accessible to disconnect, change or rearrange the 
connections and also to make series connections to the 
wire pairs for purposes of testing, protecting or 
otherwise monitoring each pair of lines. Therefore, the 
connections between the pairs of wires utilize contact 
members making electrical contact with each wire and 
then with themselves such that a pair of contacts join 
each pair of wires. The support for the contacts afford the suitable 
support for incoming wires and the ready connection of 
outgoing or cross connect wires as illustrated in USA 
patent No. 4,789,354, assigned to the assignee of this 
invention. This patent illustrates contacts having a  
 
first leg formed with a U-shaped contact element to 
make an insulation displacing electrical connection to 
a conductor of a wire and a resilient spring contact. 
One form of the mating contact elements, formed of 
appropriate conductive resilient spring-type material, 
provides a current path that can be broken by the 
separation of the two spring contact elements which are 
normally in contact between the pairs of U-slot spring 
reserve insulation displacing contacts. A second form 
maintains a current path between the U-slot spring 
reserve contacts but allows a probe to be inserted 
between a pair of spring contacts. Contacts which 
perform the same function, i.e., parallel or series 
contact with a probe, are also illustrated in U.S.A. 
Letters Patent No. 4,283,103. The differences are not 
in functions but in the construction of the contact 
elements and their relationship to the connector 
support
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A probe affording the breaking and making of 
electrical contact between two spring biased contact 

elements, comprising: a body (12), said body (12) 
having a terminal end (17) adapted to engage two 

contact elements (28,29; 30,31) formed of conductive 
material, which elements are spring loaded normally 

into electrical contact, said terminal end (17) having 
a free end, a first portion with opposite parallel 

surfaces (20,24; 24,21) terminating at said free end, 
characterized by the feature that said terminal end 

(17) has a second portion having a surface (22,23) 
diverging from said free end and oblique to said 

parallel surfaces (20,24; 24,21) to engage a contact 
element and cause the lateral displacement thereof in 

relationship to another contact element resulting in a 
wiping of the contact elements at the interface between 

the mating contact elements. 
A probe according to claim 1 characterized in 
that said probe is adapted to separate two pair of 

contact elements and said terminal end first portion 
formed with parallel surfaces (20,24; 24,21) is formed 

with a space (24) separating said opposite surfaces 
(20,21) to engage spaced contact elements, and said 

second portion (22,24; 24,23) has a space (24) 
separating two diverging surface portions (22,23) for 

engagement with separate contact elements of the pairs 
of contacts. 
A probe according to claim 1 or 2 characterized in 
that said body (12) supports thin electrical circuit 

paths (14,15,16) on at least one surface of said body 
(12) adjacent to and transversely spaced from said 

terminal end (17) for making electrical contact with 
said contact elements (28,29) prior to the separation 

of said contact elements (28,29) by said first and 
 

second portions of said terminal end (17). 
A probe according to any of claims 1 to 3 characterized in 
that said terminal end (17) is formed with a second 

surface which diverges from said free end, and said 
first (56) and second (57) portions are positioned in 

lateral spaced positions to engage the edges of two 
contact elements (50,51) causing the transverse 

movement of said two contact elements of a pair (48) of 
the contacts in relationship with a mating contact 

element (51,50) affording a wiping movement of the 
contact elements (50,51) at the electrical interface. 
A probe according to any of claims 1 to 4 characterized in 
that said terminal end second portion (57) is spaced 

from said first portion (56). 
A probe accords to any of claims 1 to 5 characterized in 
that said terminal end is separated by a space into two 

first portions (56) with one first portion (56) 
laterally spaced from the other first portion (56). 
A probe according to any of claims 1 to 6 characterized in 
that said body (42) and terminal end (44) are 

integrally molded and said terminal end first portion 
(56) and second portion (57) is divided into laterally 

spaced first portions (56) and laterally spaced second 
portions (57), and the body is terminated with edges 

spaced transversely from said transverse surfaces of 
said second portion (57) for separating the contact 

elements of a said pair of contacts at the interface 
(52).
