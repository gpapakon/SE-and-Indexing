<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for dry plucking poultry, including a conveyor (46) for delivering poultry hanging by their feet and an underlying conveyor (47) for holding the poultry by the neck, said conveyors being synchronised. The poultry are stretched between the conveyors and additional members (56-57) hold them straight while preventing them from swinging sideways. An array of plucking assemblies (BP) including protective screens (30) which come into contact with the poultry is located opposite the conveyors for delivering and holding the poultry. Each plucking assembly is moved up and down whereby the poultry are completely plucked in a series of steps as they are moved past the array of plucking assemblies by the conveyors.

extension plate (19.4) made with oblong slots (19.5)
making it possible to adjust the positioning of the

framework (8) that supports the plucking unit and in
that said base has an offset (19.6) with respect to

the plane of said plate (19.4) to allow positioning
of means (M2) of adjusting the position of the

framework that supports the plucking unit with
respect to said base. 
System as claimed in claim 5 characterised
in that the supporting framework comprises a "U"

stirrup (21) making it possible to attach a support
container (22) of the plucking unit, the upper face

of said stirrup having a threaded opening opposite
the offset (19.6) formed on the base allowing

insertion of the second means of adjustment (M2)
defined by a screw (23) with an operating handwheel.
System as claimed in either of claims 5
and 6 characterised in that the supporting framework

comprises a stirrup (21) having a bottom plate (24)
with openings providing clearance for connecting pins

(25) that fit into the oblong openings (19.5) formed
on the base and in that the sides of the stirrup have

openings (21.3) to attach a connecting plate (26),
said plate being attached to framework (8) by any

appropriate means.
System as claimed in claim 7 characterised
in that plate (26) has a curved oblong slot (26.4)

providing clearance for a locking connecting handle
(27) allowing limited, controlled swivelling of the

framework that supports the plucking unit with
respect to the gantry according to movement (M3).
System as claimed in claims 1 and 2
characterised in that it comprises a set of several

plucking units arranged in alignment opposite the
chains for conveying, suspending and securing the

poultry by its feet and neck,

   and in that said plucking units (BP1-BP2-BP3-BP4)
are mounted on a chassis structure (1), each

plucking unit being enclosed inside a shaped
protective housing (31) allowing its insertion and
