<ABSTRACT>
The anchoring element (1) for metal fittings can be 
used to secure an accessory (2) to a metal profile 

(30) with a seat defined by two moulded trims (31a, 
31b), creating a "C"-shaped profile (3); the base 

of the accessory consists of two parts (21, 22) 
which extend lengthways, [the height (H21) of the 

first (21) not exceeding the height (H) of the 
profile (3) and designed to be inserted in the seat 

(3) and] defining an oblique internal angle (SO) 

with an edge (34); the anchoring element (1) has a 
first tooth (11) whose height (H11) does not exceed 

that of the profile (3); the anchoring element (1) 
has, on the side opposite the first tooth (11), an 

angled surface (P1), to be fitted against the 
oblique surface (SO), and a second tooth (12) which 

fits against the oblique surface (SO); the element 
(1) corresponding to the first tooth (11) has a 

bevel (13) to allow the element (1) to be inserted 
in the seat (3), by inserting the first tooth (11) 

beneath the second tab (33b), then inserting the 
lower section (21) of the accessory (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anchoring element
for metal fittings, which can be used to secure accessories
or parts to the metal profiles of fittings, for example,
the hinges which connect the fixed frame to the
mobile frame.Attachment of the said parts to the structure of the
fixed and mobile frames on metal fittings is one of the
factors which considerably increases the costs relative
to the installation of this type of fitting, in terms of both
the time and care required for such operations.This problem is more evident in those cases in
which, for example, the fittings open inwards/outwards
only, where attachment of the hinge is a major part of
the fitting installation operation as a whole.The two halves of the hinge are normally fixed, one
on the fixed frame and the other on the mobile frame,
directly on the metal profiles which form the two frames
using self-tapping screws. Such a solution is unsuitable,
since the mobile wing cannot be adjusted once fitted
and, moreover, heavy wings are not provided with sufficient
support.Another method envisages working on the profile to
allow the hinge to be fitted, by making two through-holes
in the former and inserting in these holes screws to be
tightened in plugs on the inside of the profile, that is to
say, on the side of the profile opposite that facing the
half-hinge; however, this solution requires, above all as
regards the fixed frame, working to be carried out before
installing the frame in the door or window light.A further variation is the use, for fixing the hinge to
the frame of the fitting (even after installation of the fixed
frame) of grooves formed by parallel pairs of trims or
mouldings on the metal profiles, with tabs which protrude
towards each other; the said trims or mouldings
forming a kind of channel with a "C"-shaped cross-section,
the shorter sides forming symmetrical, opposing
"L"-shaped sections. This solution uses a "conventional"
type of plug, which can be attached using screws to
a particular type of hinge, with shaped lower section designed
to fit into a corresponding section of the plug, on
a convex surface; gradual tightening causes the plug to
slide along the convex surface, so that a longitudinal
portion of the plug, then a portion of the hinge base are
inserted in the two "L"-shaped sections.This solution, although allowing hinges to be fitted
to frames with channels of different shapes, necessitates
the use of a particular hinge designed for the profile
in question; with this method, use of the majority of hinges
is
