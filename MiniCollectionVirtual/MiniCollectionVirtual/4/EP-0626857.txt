<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
peritoneal dialysis. More specifically, the present
invention relates to improved peritoneal dialysis
solutions including polypeptides.It is known to use dialysis to support a patient
whose renal function has decreased to the point where the
kidneys no longer sufficiently function. Two principal
dialysis methods are utilized: hemodialysis; and
peritoneal dialysis.In hemodialysis, the patient's blood is passed
through an artificial kidney dialysis machine. A
membrane in the machine acts as an artificial kidney for
cleansing the blood. Because it is an extracorporeal
treatment that requires special machinery, there are
certain inherent disadvantages with hemodialysis.To overcome the disadvantages associated with
hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis was developed.
Peritoneal dialysis utilizes the patient's own peritoneum
as a semipermeable membrane. The peritoneum is a
membranous lining of the body cavity that due to the
large number of blood vessels and capillaries is capable
of acting as a natural semipermeable membrane.In peritoneal dialysis, a dialysis solution is
introduced into the peritoneal cavity utilizing a
catheter. After a sufficient period of time, an exchange
of solutes between the dialysate and the blood is
achieved. Fluid removal is achieved by providing a
suitable osmotic gradient from the blood to the dialysate 
to permit water outflow from the blood. This allows the
proper acid-base, electrolyte and fluid balance to be
returned to the blood and the dialysis solution is simply
drained from the body cavity through the catheter.Although there are many advantages to peritoneal
dialysis, one of the difficulties that has been
encountered is providing a dialysate that includes a
suitable osmotic agent. What is required is that a
sufficient osmotic gradient is achieved. The osmotic
agent is used in the dialysis solution to maintain the
osmotic gradient required to cause transport of water and
toxic substances across the peritoneum into the dialysis
solution.The appropriate osmotic agent needs to achieve at
least a couple criteria. First, it needs to be non-toxic
and substantially biologically inert. However, the agent
should be metabolizable. Additionally, the agent should
not rapidly cross the peritoneal membrane into the blood.
By achieving both these criteria, this would allow
maintenance of the maximum ultrafiltration gradient, and
also would prevent toxicity or accumulation of unwanted
substances in the blood.No currently used substance completely
