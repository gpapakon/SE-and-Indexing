<ABSTRACT>
A variable compression ratio mechanism for a
reciprocating internal combustion engine includes upper

and lower links mechanically linking a piston pin of a
piston to a crankpin, and a control link mechanically

linking the lower link to an eccentric cam of a control
shaft. Also provided is a control-shaft actuator

capable of continuously reducing a compression ratio by
driving the control shaft in a first rotational direction

and of continuously increasing the compression ratio by
driving the control shaft in a second rotational

direction opposite to the first rotational direction,
so that the compression ratio is controlled to a low value

in accordance with an increase in engine speed and/or
engine load. A distance from the center of the control

shaft to a centerline of the control link, measured with
the piston near top dead center, is dimensioned so that

the distance continuously decreases as the compression
ratio decreases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the improvements of a variable compression ratio mechanism for a reciprocating internal combustion engine.In order to vary a compression ratio between the volume existing within the engine cylinder with the piston at bottom dead center (BDC) and the volume in the cylinder with the piston at top dead center (TDC) depending upon engine operating conditions such as engine speed and load, in recent years, there have been proposed and developed multiple-link type reciprocating piston engines. One such multiple-link type variable compression ratio mechanism has been disclosed in pages 706 - 711 of the issue for 1997 of the paper "MTZ Motortechnische Zeitschrift 58, No. 11". The multiple-link type variable compression ratio mechanism disclosed in the paper "MTZ Motortechnische Zeitschrift 58, No. 11" is comprised of an upper link mechanically linked at one end to a piston pin, a lower link mechanically linked to both the upper link and a crankpin of an engine crankshaft, a control shaft arranged essentially parallel to the axis of the crankshaft and having an eccentric cam whose axis is eccentric to the axis of the control shaft, and a control link rockably or oscillatingly linked at one end onto the eccentric cam of the control shaft and linked at the other end to the lower end of the upper link. By way of rotary motion of the control shaft, the center of oscillating motion of the control link varies via the eccentric cam, and thus the distance between the piston pin and the crankpin also varies. In this manner, a compression ratio can be varied. In the reciprocating engine with such a multiple-link type variable compression ratio mechanism, the compression ratio is set at a relatively low value at high-load operation to avoid undesired engine knocking from occurring. Conversely, at part-load operation, the compression ratio is set at a relatively high value to enhance the combustion efficiency.During operation of the reciprocating engine with the multiple-link type variable compression ratio mechanism, owing to a great piston combustion load (compression pressure) or inertial force a load acts upon the eccentric cam of the control shaft through the piston pin, the upper link and the control link. That is, owing to the piston combustion load, torque acts to rotate the control shaft in one rotational direction. Assuming that the magnitude of torque occurring due to piston combustion load is excessively great, a driving force needed to drive the control shaft to a desired
