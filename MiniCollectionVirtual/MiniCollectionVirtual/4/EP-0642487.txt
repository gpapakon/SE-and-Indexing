<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for rectifying 
product phenol obtained by the acid-catalyzed decomposition 
of cumene hydroperoxide. Phenol produced by the acid-catalyzed 
decomposition of cumene hydroperoxide is conventionally 
purified via a series of distillations in which 
progressively heavier components of the decomposition 
mixture are separated as overheads. The decomposition product is neutralized, 
typically in an alkaline ion exchanger, before being 
separated into products phenol and acetone, by-products, 
and unreacted cumene for recycle. The decomposition mass is separated sequentially 
into acetone, cumene, alpha-methylstyrene (AMS), phenol and 
high boiling residues. Phenol, acetone and AMS are further 
purified into end products. Recovered cumene is caustic 
washed to rid it of acidity before recycle to oxidation. 
The separation of the crude decomposition mass is carried 
out in a series of fractionating distillation columns in 
commercial operation. Phenol purification is carried out in vacuum 
distillation columns usually equipped with from 30 to 40 
vapor-liquid counter current contact trays or equivalent 
height of mass transfer packed beds. Considerable amounts of phenol remain with higher 
boilers in the bottoms of the final distillation column in 
which product phenol is rectified, and obtained as an 
overhead stream. To insure adequate quality for the phenol in the 
overheads, typically greater than 15% phenol is left in the 
bottoms of such phenol rectification column, along with 
heavy impurities such as acetophenone, cumylphenol, 
alpha-methylstyrene dimers (AMS dimers) and other high 
boilers (residue). Although an attempt is made in a 
subsequent residue column to recover more phenol, albeit of  
 
a lesser quality, in order to reduce the amount lost with 
high boilers in those bottoms, phenol still represents at 
least 5% of the total residual high boilers. These are 
usually burned to recover only heat values. Furthermore, the overheads of such subsequent 
residue column, predominantly phenol, contain too much 
acetophenone to be acceptable as product, thus are recycled 
upstream in the process, for rework. U.S. Patent 4,415,409 to Zudkevitch et al. 
discloses a process for extractive distillation of phenol 
and acetophenone using cumylphenol as an extractive 
solvent. However, this patent does not teach or suggest 
the combination of distillation steps and the added 
advantages of the process claimed herein. In a process for separating phenol obtained by

IN THE CLAIMS:
1. In a process for separating phenol obtained by the decomposition of cumene hydroperoxide from high boiling impurities, the improvement comprising: a) feeding phenol rectification bottoms comprising phenol, acetophenone, cumylphenol, alpha-methylstyrene dimers and -high boiler residue to a first phenol freeing distillation column A; b) feeding concentrated bottoms with substantially reduced phenol content from column A to a second residue concentration distillation column B; c) withdrawing a stream rich in compounds boiling between phenol and residue, particularly cumylphenol, from said column B from a point below the feed and returning at least a portion of said stream to said column A at a point above the feed; d) recovering overheads from column A comprising at least 95 weight percent phenol; and e) recovering acetophenone-rich overheads from column B comprising at least 70 weight percent acetophenone.
2. The process of claim 1 wherein a second portion of said stream rich in compounds boiling between phenol and residue, particularly cumylphenol, is removed.
3. The process of claim 2 wherein said stream comprises at least 60 weight percent cumylphenol.
4. The process of claim 2 wherein total weight of cumylphenol added to column A is at least 4 times the total weight of acetophenone added to column A.
5. The process of claim 4 wherein total weight of cumylphenol added to column A is at least 5.5 times the total weight of acetophenone added to column A.
