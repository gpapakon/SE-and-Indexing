<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing α-olefin polymers in which the content of high-stereospecificity polymer expressed by 105°C xylene-insoluble traction (XIS) is very low in spite of a low content of low-stereospecificity polymer expressed by 20°C xylene-soluble fraction (CXS).More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for producing α-olefin polymers low in stickiness due to low CXS. excellent in stretching properties due to low XIS, and successfully usable for formation of films, fibers, blow molded articles, extrusion molded articles, etc.Because of their excellence in transparency, gloss, stiffness, water vapor barrier property, etc., biaxially oriented polypropylene films are extensively used as packaging materials. As the polypropylene used for production of biaxially oriented films, homopolymer of propylene is most conventional, and highly crystalline homopolymer of propylene obtained by the use of a high-stereospecificity catalyst has been used with the aim of improving the film properties, such as stiffness, of biaxially oriented film. However, such highly stereo-specific homopolymer of polypropylene is not good in the stretchability and has a fault that it is apt to make troubles such as film breaking in the process of stretching. Thus, a variety of methods for improving the stretchability of highly crystalline polypropylene have so far been proposed. As one example of such proposals, copolymerization of propylene with a small amount of ethylene is known.Concretely speaking, JP-B-46-11027 has proposed a process for producing a polypropylene for use in production of films which comprises polymerizing propylene together with a very small amount of ethylene in the presence of a coordination catalyst and a hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent so that one mole of the monomer unit in the resulting polymer becomes containing 0.01 mole or less of ethylene unit. Further, in JP-B-64-6211, there is proposed a process for producing a polypropylene improved in stretching properties which comprises feeding propylene together with a small amount of ethylene into polymerization system using a catalyst consisting of an organoaluminum compound and titanium trichloride prepared by reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound and further activating the reduced product by a treatment using a complex-forming agent, a treatment using an organoaluminum compound a treatment using titanium tetrachloride or a combination thereof so that the resulting
