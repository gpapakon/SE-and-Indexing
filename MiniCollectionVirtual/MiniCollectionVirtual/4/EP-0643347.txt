<ABSTRACT>
A self-biased cascode current mirror includes a current 
mirror (60), and a cascode bias generator (50). The cascode bias 

generator (50) includes a resistor (51) to provide a bias voltage for 
the current mirror (60). The current mirror (60) includes cascode 

transistor (64) and two mirror transistors (62, 63). The bias 
voltage is approximately equal to a minimum saturation voltage of 

the cascode transistor (64) plus a gate-source voltage of the 
transistor (63) of the current mirror (60). The self-biased cascode 

current mirror (60) has a high output impedance and high voltage 
swing while providing low power consumption and requiring a 

small layout area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to current mirrors, and more 
particularly, to a self-biased cascode current mirror having high 
voltage swing and low power consumption. Current mirrors are often used in analog circuits to replicate 
signal and bias currents. A current mirror may be characterized as 
having an output impedance which affects the accuracy of the 
current replicated in the current mirror. High output impedance in 
current mirrors is required for accurate replication of currents. In 
order to obtain a high output impedance, known current mirrors 
utilize cascode transistors. A current mirror may also be 
characterized as having an output voltage swing. High voltage 
swing in current mirrors is desired for accurate operation with 
low power supply voltages and for increased voltage signal 
amplitudes which improve the accuracy of analog circuitry 
utilizing the current mirrors. FIG. 1 illustrates in schematic diagram form prior art high-swing 
cascode current mirror 10. High-swing cascode current 
mirror 10 includes current mirror 30 and cascode bias generator 
20. Current mirror 30 includes N-channel cascode transistors 31 
and 34 and N-channel transistors 32 and 33. N-channel transistor 
31 has a source, a gate for receiving a bias voltage labeled 
"CNBIAS", and a drain coupled to current source 23 for receiving an 
input current labeled "IIN". N-channel transistor 32 has a source 
connected to a power supply voltage terminal labeled "VSS", a gate 
connected to the drain of transistor 31, and a drain connected to 
the source of transistor 31. N-channel transistor 34 has a source, 
a gate for receiving bias voltage CNBIAS, and a drain for providing  
 
an output current labeled "IOUT". N-channel transistor 33 has a 
source connected to VSS, a gate connected to the drain of N-channel 
transistor 31, and a drain connected to the source of transistor 34. Cascode bias generator 20 includes N-channel transistor 21 
and current source 22. Current source 22 has a first terminal 
connected to VDD, and a second terminal. Diode-connected N-channel 
transistor 21 has a source connected to VSS, a drain 
connected to the second terminal of current source 22 for 
providing bias voltage CNBIAS, and a gate connected to its drain. Current mirror 30 is a conventional cascode current mirror 
which has high output impedance. The drain of cascode transistor 
34 is the output terminal of prior art high-swing cascode current 
mirror 10. Cascode transistor 34 enhances the output impedance 
of the current mirror by reducing
