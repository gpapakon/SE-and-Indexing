<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a thermosettable composition 
consisting of a non-flammable elastomeric material that 

includes an elastomeric polyurethane composition that has a 
base of an aliphatic diol, characterized by the fact that 

said composition also includes, in combination, antimony 
trioxide and at least one compound selected from among the 

diphenyl oxides that are substituted by at least 5 bromine 
atoms. The compositions have utility in the area of 

optical components for optical fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a thermosettable composition 
consisting of a non-flamable elastomeric polyurethane, 
duplicate molding of optical components with the aid of 
said composition, and the optical components thus obtained. French patent No. FR-A-2 652 912 describes a procedure 
for the encapsulation of an optical component for the 
interconnection of optical fibers, with said component 
being in the form of a bar that is associated with said 
fibers, and with said procedure being characterized by the 
fact that said bar is inserted, in a direction that is 
oriented transversely in relation to the longitudinal axis 
of said bar, into an elongated envelope that has a U-shaped 
cross section that is essentially complementary to the 
cross section of said bar, and by the fact that a sealing 
product is then deposited into the portion of said envelope 
that is adjacent to the open contour of said envelope, in 
such a way as to fix said bar within said envelope. French patent application No. 92 01008, (Publication 
2694818), describes an improvement in said procedure, which  
 
improvement consists of utilizing, as a sealing product, a 
thixotropic composition which, after having been hardened, 
displays a scant water regain i.e., a water regain of less 
than 2 percent. The Thixotropic compositions that are 
offered as examples include a composition that contains a 
polyurethane resin that has a base of polybutadienediol, in 
association with a filling. It has recently become desirable to perfect the 
manufacture of an encapsulated optical component through 
the realization of a complete coating of the latter by 
means of duplicate molding through the use of a 
thermosetting elastomer. The conditions which the duplicate molding material 
must satisfy are fairly similar to the conditions imposed 
for the composition that serves to seal the bar within the 
envelope, i.e., in the sense that said material must 
display a scant water regain and good adhesion to the 
constituent material of the envelope, which constituent 
material is usually a metal, such as a stainless steel. 
Therefore, consideration has been given to the idea of 
using, as a duplicate molding material, a polyurethane 
composition of the type that is used in the formulation of 
the above-mentioned thixotropic sealing composition, i.e., 
a polyurethane composition that has a base of an aliphatic 
diol, and particularly a base of polybutadiene-diol, with 
the incorporation of a pigment, such as for example carbon 
black, with a view toward
