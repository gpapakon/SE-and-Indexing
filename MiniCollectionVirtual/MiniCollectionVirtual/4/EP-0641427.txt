<ABSTRACT>
An interface circuit for processing signals from a touch trigger probe is adapted to prevent the generation of false trigger signals during an inspection cycle. The probe incorporates a plurality of strain gauges, the voltage across which rises above a predetermined threshold when a stylus supported by the probe contacts a surface. When the probe is moved away from the surface and the stylus loses contact, the outputs across the gauges drop below the trigger threshold. The interface prevents false triggers when, while the stylus is in contact with a surface, a machine vibration occurs which causes an oscillation in the voltage across the gauges; the voltage dropping below the threshold level (causing the interface to reset), and then immediately passing back up through the threshold, causing the interface to emit a trigger signal. The interface of the present invention prevents such an occurrence by returning to its seated level only if, at a predetermined time interval after the sensor signal has passed below the predetermined threshold, the signal level from the or each sensor has not once again exceeded the predetermined threshold value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for processing
signals from a trigger probe on a coordinate positioning
machine, such as a machine tool or a coordinate measuring
machine, and to the processing of signals from such a
probe. Trigger probes are employed on such machines to
measure, for example, the dimensions of an object.One known form of trigger probe is a "touch trigger" probe,
which includes a fixed structure, such as a housing, by
which the probe is supported on a movable arm of the
machine, and a stylus supporting member supported in a rest
position relative to the fixed structure, from which the
supporting member is displaceable when a force is applied
thereto, and to which position it may return after the
force has been removed. The stylus supporting member
supports an elongate stylus having a sensing tip at its
free end. In use, the movable arm of the machine is driven
until the sensing tip of the stylus is brought into contact
with an object whose position is to be measured. Contact
between the sensing tip and the object is sensed by one or
more sensors provided within the probe, which may, for
example, take the form of strain gauges, piezoelectric
elements, or an electric circuit within the probe whose
resistance varies when the supporting member is displaced
from its rest position. Processing circuitry (known as an
"interface") associated with the probe emits a step or
"trigger" signal when the signal level from the or each
sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold. The trigger
signal is used to instruct the machine control to determine
the position of the movable arm at this instant in time,
and to arrest movement of the movable arm. The small
movement of the arm over the time period between the 
sensing tip contacting the workpiece and the movement of
the arm being brought to a standstill is known as
overtravel, and is accommodated by displacement of the
stylus supporting member relative to the fixed structure.
After a measurement has been taken, the arm is backed away
from the surface and the stylus supporting member returns
to its rest position relative to the fixed structure,
whereupon the signal levels from the or each sensor return
to a level which is below the predetermined threshold. As
a result, the step signal from the interface circuit
returns to its pre-trigger or "reseated" (indicating the
status of the supporting member) level, re-enabling the
probe for further measurements.A problem frequently experienced when using trigger probes
on such machines is the tendency of
