<ABSTRACT>
A Multi-Functional Corneal Analysis System for ascertaining the shape of the corneal surface of the eye comprises a CCD camera, frame grabber board and digital image processing algorithm with associated processing circuitry. The CCD camera receives a reflection of a target such as Placido's disc from the surface of the cornea. The CCD image of the reflection of the Placido disc from the corneal surface is captured by the frame grabber board and subjected to digital analysis after treatment in an edge detector. The edge detector reduces the number of data points that must be processed to define the radius of each ring in the reflected Placido disc image. The resultant data are processed to derive surface contour and to provide a display in tabular, graphic or pictorial form of the contour data so generated. The system can be used to design custom contact lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CHECKERED PLACIDO APPARATUS AND METHODThis specification incorporates by reference, an appendix from U.S. Patent Application No. 07/891,961 filed June 2, 1992, entitled "Checkered PlacidoApparatus and Method." The appendix is a source code listing for the CORNEAL ANALYSIS SYSTEM software, contained on 11 microfiche, having 997 frames. The source code is also submitted on diskette, as part of this application.A number of forms of eye surgery including lamellar corneal surgery, keratomileusis, epikeratophakia, cataract surgery, penetrating keratoplasty, corneal transplantation radial keratotomy as well as laser refractive keratectomy involve a consideration of corneal surface topography. In radial keratotomy, for example, a number of cuts are made into the cornea in order to change its curvature and correct refractive power so that images focus closer to the retina, if not upon it for best visual acuity. It has been reported that after radial keratotomy "about 55 percent of the patients function without glasses and the remaining 45 percent have some degree of improvement. " Origination of the technique of radial keratotomy and other techniques in refractive surgery are generally credited to Dr. Svyatasklav Fyodorov of the Soviet Union who is reputed to have performed thousands of such operations.While ophthalmic surgery is often successfully performed, the results obtained have been subject to variation occasioned by the particular operating 

" style" of the individual surgeon which dictates the number, location and depth of incision. Elements of subjective judgment are paramount. It would be useful to provide a device that could assist the surgeon in more quantitatively assessing pre- operative and post-operative corneal contours.The present system relates to improvements in the art of photokeratometry and mere particularly to the use of digital image processing techniques to ascertain the radius of curvature, refractive power and contour of the cornea. A keratometer is an instrument for determining the curvature shape of the corneal surface which generally uses a Placido or other illuminated target that is centered around the patient's line of sight. The reflection of a Placido or other illuminated target by the patient's cornea or by the tear film on the anterior surface of the cornea is subsequently analyzed to determine the surface contour of the eye.The technique in modern form dates from the early thirties when the Zeiss optical company of Germany introduced a "Photo Keratoscope" .
