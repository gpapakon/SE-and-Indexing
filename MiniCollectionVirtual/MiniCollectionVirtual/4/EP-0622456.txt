<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains in general to 
highly purified recombinant platelet-derived growth 
factor (rPDGF) and methods for obtaining such 
material. In particular, the present invention relates 
to affinity chromatographic purification of rPDGF 
employing monoclonal antibodies and to such monoclonal 
antibodies, as well as to a method of production of 
crude PDGF in quantities sufficient to be useful. Ross et at., Proc. Natl. Acad., Sci. USA71: 
1207-1210 (1974) described platelet derived growth 
factor (PDGF) as a factor found in whole blood serum but 
not platelet-poor serum, which factor was able to 
support growth of fibroblasts in culture. Unreduced PDGF is a 27-35kd mw protein. The 
variation in the number of bands observed on some 
separating gels may be due to glycosylation differences, 
protease action during purification, or the presence of 
more than one molecular species. Reduction of PDGF 
yields 2 or more smaller bands on gels, in a molecular 
weight range of 10-18kd The model favored by most in 
the field is that the native 27-35kd mw species consists 
of 2 smaller, dissimilar subunits of approximately 18kd 
and 16kd molecular weights, called respectively the "A" 
and "B" subunits (or alternatively PDGF A chain and PDGF  
 
B chain). Doolittle et at., Science221: 275-76 
(1983); and Waterfield et at., Nature304: 2810-14 
(1983) described the partial amino acid sequences of the 
two subunits of PDGF, indicating that the amino acid 
sequence of the PDGF B chain was more than 90% 
homologous with the predicted protein product of v-sis, 
the oncogene contained within the oncogenic simian 
sarcoma virus (SSV). The A chain was found to be 
approximately 60% homologous to the B chain. Simian sarcoma virus was isolated from the 
fibrosarcoma of a woolly monkey. This virus causes 
oncogenic transformation of cells, and causes sarcomas 
in some animals. The complete SSV genome has been 
cloned and sequenced, and the oncogene region (v-sis) 
was identified and found to be potentially capable of 
coding for a fusion protein of 28-33kd molecular 
weight. Antisera raised to peptides based on this 
sequence immunoprecipitated a protein of 28kd from SSV-infected 
cells. This protein was called p28sis (Robbins 
et at., Nature305:605-608 (1983)). Using v-sis as a 
probe, chromosomal clones corresponding to c-sis were 
isolated from a human liver library by Gallo et al. 
(Nature292:31 (1981); and Josephs et al. Science 
219:503-505 (1983)) and Aaronson et al. (Cell37:123 
(1983)). In addition, using
