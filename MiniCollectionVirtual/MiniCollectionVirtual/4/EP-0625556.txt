<ABSTRACT>
2.1 Wooden coffins are treated with paints to improve their appearance. Since the wooden coffins are intended for introduction into the earth it is necessary that they do not contain environmentally harmful substances. 2.2 An environmentally friendly paint is obtained by mixing two parts of wood glue in six parts of water and adding ten parts of chalk.
