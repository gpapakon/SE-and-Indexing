<ABSTRACT>
The regulation system is used for an electric drive unit (17) supplied from a fuel cell (1) on board the vehicle, the power obtained from the fuel cell adjusted by regulating the oxidant mass flow rate. Pref. a required power signal is supplied in dependence on the depression of the vehicle accelerator pedal, the corresponding mass flow rate compared with the actual mass flow rate via a regulating circuit, for correcting the detected difference between them.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the dynamic control of the power of
an electric drive unit (17) of a vehicle which is

supplied with electrical energy by a fuel cell (1)
arranged in the vehicle, characterized in that the

power (p
BZ
) produced by the fuel cell (1) is set by
controlling the rate of oxidant flow (
m
 ˙
act
) and in that
in each case the maximum electrical power (p
max
) made
available by the fuel cell (1) is fed to the electrical

drive unit (17), in that a set value (p
corr
) for the
drive power is supplied to the drive unit (17), which

set value is determined from the actual value (
m
 ˙
act
) of
the rate of oxidant flow.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a set value (p
set
) for the power is determined from
the accelerator pedal position (FP), in that the rate

of oxidant flow (
m
 ˙
set
) which the fuel cell (1) requires
to produce the set value (p
set
) for the power is
determined and fed to a comparison point (23) of a

control circuit as set value, in that the

instantaneously flowing rate of oxidant flow (
m
 ˙
act
) is
determined and is fed to the comparison point (23) of

the control circuit as actual value, and in that the
comparison point (23) determines a difference rate of

air flow (Δ
m
 ˙), which is controlled to 0, from the
difference between the set value (
m
 ˙
set
) for the rate of 
air flow and the actual value (
m
 ˙
act
) for the rate of air
flow.
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the rate of oxidant flow (
m
 ˙
act
) is controlled by
controlling the speed of revolution (n) of a compressor

(8) arranged in the second feed line (5).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that ambient air is supplied to the fuel cell (1) as

oxidant via the second feed line (5).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the set value (p
set
) for the power which is determined
from the accelerator pedal position (FP) is

limited as a function of operating parameters.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the set value (p
corr
) for the drive power is
determined as a function of operating parameters.
