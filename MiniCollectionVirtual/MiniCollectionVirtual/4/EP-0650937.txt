<ABSTRACT>
Transparent oxynitride glass has transmittance of at 
least 80 %/mm in a wavelength region of 400 to 800 nm, 

with Si particles or Si alloy particles of not more than 
1.0 × 10⁹/cm³ in number. Glass fiber prepared by drawing 

this glass can attain strength which is by far superior 
to that of conventional oxide glass fiber. Fibers are used as 

reinforcing fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oxynitride glass 
which is excellent in transparency and strength, and a 
method of preparing the same. Glass fiber which is 
prepared from the inventive glass is employed as 
reinforcing fiber for various composite materials such as 
FRP (fiber-glass reinforced plastics). In oxynitride glass, oxygen forming oxide glass is 
partially replaced by nitrogen having three bond 
valences. Thus, a larger number of chemical bonds are 
formed in the oxynitride glass as compared with the oxide 
glass, to strengthen the network of the glass. Thus, the 
oxynitride glass has excellent physical properties such 
as a high elastic modulus, high hardness and high 
strength, and is suitably applied to reinforcing fiber or 
the like. In general, such oxynitride glass is prepared by a  
 
melting method of mixing a nitride raw material such as 
Si3N4 or AlN with another glass raw material of a metal 
oxide such as SiO2 and melting the mixture in inert or 
reducing gas for a long time. However, conventional 
oxynitride glass which is prepared by melting under such 
environment easily causing reduction reaction is 
considerably colored and hazed with low transparency in a 
visible region of 400 to 800 nm, while its strength is 
inferior as compared with the expected physical value. An object of the present invention is to provide 
oxynitride glass and oxynitride glass fiber which are 
remarkably superior in strength to the prior art. The inventors have made deep study on improvement in 
physical properties of oxynitride glass and recognized 
that it is possible to obtain oxynitride glass and 
oxynitride glass fiber of an absolutely novel structure 
which are transparent and excellent in physical strength 
by employing specific preparation conditions, to complete 
the present invention. The present invention provides oxynitride glass 
containing Si particles or Si alloy particles of at least 
0.1 µm by not more than 1.0 × 109/cm3 in number. The 
inventive glass has transmittance of at least 80 %/mm at  
 
a wavelength of 400 to 800 nm, in particular. The 
present invention also provides a method of preparing 
such glass, and glass fiber. According to the inventive method of preparing 
oxynitride glass, the following raw materials are first 
mixed with each other: 
(i) SiO2;  (ii) Si3N4 or another metal nitride;  (iii) at least one metal oxide; and (iv) CaO or CaO + MgO. In place of Si3N4, the nitrogen source of the above 
item (ii) can be prepared from a metal nitride such as 
AlN, Mg3N or
