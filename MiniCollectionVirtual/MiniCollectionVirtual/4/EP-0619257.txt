<ABSTRACT>
The invention is to provide an adjustable blowing turning bar for a material web, in which it is possible to close the blowing orifices which are temporarily not required, round which a paper web is not looped and which are arranged in the outer surface of the turning bar. This is carried out, according to the invention, in that the turning bar consists of a tube which has air orifices and on the inner surface of which a slide provided with air orifices bears and can be axially displaced in a specific manner by adjusting means at least by the amount of a distance corresponding to the diameter of an air orifice. The air orifices of the slide can thereby either be brought to overlap with the air orifices of the tube or be closed relative to these.

machines, for the purpose of deflecting a material web, 
preferably a paper web, the turning bar having, in the region
