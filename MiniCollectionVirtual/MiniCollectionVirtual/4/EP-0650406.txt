<ABSTRACT>
A device for cutting moving material webs, especially of fibrous materials, to shape comprises a rotating shape cutting roller and a rotating counter cutting roller. The shape cutting roller has a shape cutting side and the counter-roller a smooth surface. Both rollers are borne in a machine frame by means of rotary bearings and the center distance between them is adjustable. The rollers are rotatably fitted in separate first and second machine frame components which are supported on a shared machine base-frame. One of these machine frame components is fitted on an adjustable wedge guide to adjust the center distance between the rollers. Each machine frame component can be braced on the machine base-frame.

<CLAIMS>
A device for cutting moving webs of material to shape, in 
particular made of fibrous materials, having a rotatingly 

driven shape cutting cylinder (2) and a rotatingly driven 
counter cutting cylinder (3), whereby the shape cutting 

cylinder comprises a shape cutting edge (4) and the 
counter cutting cylinder comprises a smooth surface shell 

(6), both cylinders are mounted in a machine frame by 
means of pivot bearings (7, 9) on both sides and the 

centre distance of the cylinders is adjustable,
characterised in that
 the cylinders (2, 3) are rotatably 
mounted in separate first and second machine frame parts 

(8, 11), which in turn are supported on a common machine 
underframe (12),
in that
 to adjust the centre distance of the cylinders 
(2, 3) one of these machine frame parts (11) is attached 

to an adjustable wedge-shaped guide (14),
and in that
 each machine frame part (8, 11) can be 
separately braced with the machine underframe (12). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the first machine frame part (8) is 
permanently braced with the machine underframe part (12),
in that
 the second machine frame part (11) is supported 
on a bridge (13) freely covering the counter cutting 

cylinder (3), which in turn rests on the wedge-shaped 
guide (14),
and in that
 the second machine frame part (11) can be 
braced with the wedge-shaped guide (14) and the machine 

underframe part (12) via a clamping device (24), which is 
disposed on a yoke (26) fixed to the frame and covering 

the cylinders (2, 3).  
 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the pivot bearings (7, 9) of the 
two cylinders (2, 3) are prestressed. 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the wedge-shaped guide (14) 
includes a first part (16), which is horizontally 

displaceable on the machine underframe part (12) by an 
adjusting device (18), and also bears a second part (17) 

resting on the first and bearing the second machine frame 
part (11). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 to avoid vibrations of the 
cylinders (2, 3) in each case the pivot bearings (7, 9) 

are disposed as close to one another as possible and have 
the largest possible diameter. 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the pivot bearings (7, 9) can be 
cooled in controlled manner to avoid thermal expansion. 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the cylinders (2, 3) can be cooled 
in a controlled manner to avoid thermal expansion.
