<ABSTRACT>
The scanning area of a specimen is 
divided into m sections (m is an integer of two 

or more) in the subscanning direction. The 
range of one of the measurement conditions or 

parameters is graded into m stages. The values 
of the m stages are assigned to the m sections 

of the scanning areas in order. The images 
picked up under the m stages of the condition 

or parameter respectively are displayed on a 
screen simultaneously so that the images can be 

compared. One of the images is selected and the 
value of the condition or parameter corresponding 

to the selected image is determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic
inspection and imaging instrument and more particularly
relates to an ultrasonic inspection and imaging
instrument which permits any person who is inexperienced
in ultrasonic measurement to readily select an optimum or
a proper measurement condition.An ultrasonic inspection and imaging instrument as
one of ultrasonic measurement instruments is capable of
displaying the interior of an object under examination in
the form of a B- and a C- scope image. An imaging
instrument of this sort, in order to obtain a clear
image, necessitates such as setting and selection of
various measurement conditions including acoustic
characteristic of its probe, sound velocity in a medium
and an object under examination at their instant
temperature and the like, setting a gate in the object
under examination at a desired depth according to the
selected measurement condition and further, focusing
operation setting the focus for the probe.Conventionally, for the gate setting and the
focusing operation, a reflection waveform (an A scope 
image) from the object under examination was observed by
using an oscilloscope or the like, a desired measurement
depth, detection gate width and the like were set
according to the observed waveform as well as an
operation of moving up and down (positioning in Z
direction) of a focusing type ultrasonic probe
(hereinafter simply called as probe) with respect to the
object under examination was performed so as to focus the
probe at a desired measurement depth and further to
maximize a target reflection echo.However, in case of an inspection of defects
existing inside a measurement specimen such as cracks,
voids and foreign matters, the shapes of the defects are
indefinite, for this reason the intensities of defect
echos from these defects vary and could not be detected
in a uniform manner. Further, the location and depth of
defects are frequently indeterminable in certain types of
objects under examination. For this reason, a
measurement is performed by provisionally selecting
setting values and setting measurement conditions.Accordingly, for the purpose of selecting an optimum
measurement condition for a certain object under
examination, such as proble height, probe gain and gate
position which provide an optimum image are determined
while observing images obtained by probe scanning. In
particular, in an arrangement in which such as the probe
height, probe gain and gate position are set via a 
computer control there are many setting numbers for the
m
