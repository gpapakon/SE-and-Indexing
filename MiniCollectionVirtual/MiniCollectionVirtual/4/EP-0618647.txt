Each contact socket (15) is fixed in and/or on the electrical conductor (SL) by means of a contact tab (6) and, in so doing, the contact socket pair (5) of each plug socket (3) is fixed, corresponding to its installation position, in or transversely or diagonally with respect to the longitudinal direction of the electrical conductors (SL) located on the same, by plugging, riveting, screwing or spot-welding.
