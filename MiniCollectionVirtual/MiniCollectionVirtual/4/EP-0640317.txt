<ABSTRACT>
An electrosurgical instrument is provided for 
cauterization and/or welding of tissue of varying 

impedances, thicknesses and vascularity especially in the 
performance of endoscopic procedures. The instrument 

compresses the tissue between one pole of a bipolar energy 
source located on one interfacing surface, and a second 

interfacing surface. A second pole is located one of the 
two interfacing surfaces. In a preferred embodiment, the 

second pole is located on the same interfacing surface as 
the first pole and an insulator electrically isolates the 

two poles. A preferred application of the invention is in 
a cutting instrument wherein a hemostatic line is formed 

along a cut line using RF energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrosurgical
instrument for cauterization, coagulation and/or tissue
welding in the performance of surgical procedures,
especially endoscopic procedures.Surgical procedures requiring cutting of tissue can
cause bleeding at the site of the cutting. Before
surgeons had the means to control bleeding many surgical
procedures were quite difficult to perform because of
excessive blood loss. Hemostasis is even more crucial in
endoscopic or laparoscopic surgery where if the bleeding
is not kept under control, the laparoscopy must be
abandoned and the patient's body cut to perform open
surgery so that inaccessible bleeding may be controlled.Thus, various techniques have been adapted to control
bleeding with varying degrees of success such as, for
example, suturing, applying clips to blood vessels, and
stapling, as well as electrocautery and other thermogenic
techniques. Advances in tissue joining, tissue repair and
wound closure also have permitted surgical procedures
previously not possible or too risky.Initially, suturing was one of the primary means for
providing hemostasis and joining tissue. Before other
hemostatic and tissue repair means were introduced,
surgeons had to spend a great deal of time sewing the
tissue of patients back together. Surgical clips were introduced as a means to close
off blood vessels, particularly when cutting highly
vascularized tissue. Application of surgical clips,
however, can be cumbersome in certain procedures. The
vessels must be identified. Then a clip must be
individually applied on both sides of the intended cut of
each identified vessel. Also, it may be difficult to find
some vessels, particularly where the vessel is surrounded
by fatty tissue.Surgical staplers have been effective in decreasing
the amount of time it takes to fasten tissue together.
There are various types of surgical staplers. Staplers
have been used for tissue joining, and to provide
hemostasis in conjunction with tissue cutting. Such
devices include, for example, linear and circular cutting
and stapling instruments. Typically, a linear cutter has
parallel rows of staples with a slot for a cutting means
to travel between the rows of staples. This type of
surgical stapler secures tissue for improved cutting,
joins layers of tissue, and provides hemostasis by
applying parallel rows of staples to layers of surrounding
tissue as the cutting means cuts between the parallel
rows. These types of cutting and stapling devices have
been used successfully in procedures involving
