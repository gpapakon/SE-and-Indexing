A rigid panel for a vehicle roof with a 
circumferential seal relative to the roof opening (1), 

with a glass plate (2), which is connected to a base 
frame (10) placed underneath and projecting laterally in 

the edge region, a circumferential aluminium frame (12) 
being secured to the projecting edge (11) of the base 

frame (10), which aluminium frame comprises a gap seal 
(3) on its outside, characterised in that the glass plate 

(2) is formed by two panes (6, 7), which are connected to 
one another, the lower pane (7) being larger than the 

upper pane (6) so as to project laterally beyond the 
upper pane, the base frame (10) encloses the lower pane 

(7) with clearance with an upwardly bent edge (11) and 
the approximately T-shaped aluminium frame (12) covers 

the lower pane (7) with one side and on the other side 
comprises an undercut groove (15) for receiving a fir 

tree-shaped foot (24) of the gap seal (3), the gaps 
between the projecting edge (11) of the base frame (10), 

the edges (8) of the panel panes (6, 7) and the T-shaped 
aluminium frame (12) being foam-filled or injected with a 

mass (16) of polyurethane. 
A panel according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the gap seal (3) is made of a flat main profile web (23) 

made of an elastomer, onto one side of which a fir tree-shaped 
extension (24) is moulded to form a dovetail 

connection with the groove (15) of the T-shaped aluminium 
frame (12) and onto the other side of which a cavity 

profile (25) made of foam rubber with external flocking 
(27) is extruded. 
A panel according to claim 1, characterised in that 
polyurethane (17) is also spayed around the upper side of 

the T-shaped aluminium frame (12) in such a manner that 
the sprayed surface (17) adjoins with the upper side of 

the glass plate (2) in a flush manner.  
 
A panel according to claim 1, characterised in that 
foam strips (20, 21) for limiting the polyurethane flow 

are bonded between the base frame (10) and the glass 
plate (2) and between the upturned edge (11) of the base 

frame (10) and the T-shaped aluminium profile (12). 
A panel according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the gap seal (3) is formed by a 

profile section (A) on the front side of the panel with a 
sealing lip (26), which projects outwards and downwards 

at an angle from the cavity seal (25), and a profile 
section (B) on the remaining circumferential edge of the 

T-shaped aluminium frame (12) with a sealing web (30), 
which projects downwards from the main profile web (23), 

and the two profile sections (A) and (B) are bonded to 
one another at their abutting edges (4, 5). 
A panel according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the profile section (A) comprises a double-core contact 

cord (31) as an anti-jamming element in the central 
transition region between the cavity seal (25) and the 

main profile web (23). 
A panel according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a sun protection film (35) is arranged between the panel 

panes (6, 7). 
A panel according to claim 1, characterised in that 
solar cells are fitted between the two panel panes (6, 

7). 
A method for manufacturing a panel according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the double-pane glass 

plate, the base frame and the T-shaped aluminium profile 
are positioned relative to one another, the remaining 

intermediate gaps and the upper side of the T-shaped  
 

aluminium profile are injected with a hardening 
polyurethane mass and the gap seal is then buttoned into 

the lateral groove in the aluminium profile.
