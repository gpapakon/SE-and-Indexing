<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to information
recording methods and apparatuses which use a medium for
recording information by irradiating an energy beam and
more particularly, to an information recording method and
medium which can exhibit excellent effects on a phase
transition optical disk as well as to an information
recording apparatus based on the information recording
method.In a related art method for performing recording
and erasing operations over a rewritable recording film,
for example, when an optical disk is used which has an
exchange coupling two-layer film as a recording film as
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,475,657, or when a phase
transition type optical disk recording film is used which
can erase information at high speed by realizing crystallization
in substantially the same time as a laser
irradiation time for recording as disclosed in JP-A-62-259229
(laid-open on November 11, 1987); the recording and
erasing are carried out by changing energy of one energy
beam to one of at least two levels higher than a reading
power level, that is, by changing the energy of the energy
beam to one of at least a high power level and an intermediate
power level. This method is advantageous in that
so-called overwriting (rewriting based on overwriting) of 
recording new information while erasing existing information
can be realized. Further, as disclosed in JP-A-62-259229
and JP-A-3-185629 (laid-open on August 13, 1991),
such a phenomenon that a recording mark becomes a tear drop
shape can be suppressed (a backward width of the recording
mark becomes larger than a forward width thereof) by
changing the energy of an energy beam into one of three
power levels, that is, high and intermediate levels and a
level lower than the intermediate level.In recent years, there has been put in practical
use a DVD-RAM (digital video disk-random access memory)
which uses a 120mm-diametered disk made of phase transition
material and having a memory capacity of 2.6 GB on its one
side. A recording control method employed in this example
is as shown in Fig. 1 and is explained as DVD Specification
for Rewritable Disc (DVD-RAM), Part 1, Physical Specifications,
version 1.0 (July, 1997), Page PHX-9, Fig. F-1.JP-A-63-48617 (laid-open on March 1, 1988) also
discloses a method for changing an energy beam depending on
a mark length (corresponding to a region length in a second
state in claims at the time of its application) or on a
space length (corresponding to a region length in a first
state in claims at the time of its
