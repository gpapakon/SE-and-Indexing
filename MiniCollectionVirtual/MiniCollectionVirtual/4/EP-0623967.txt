<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides for antenna apparatus having antenna 
members (10,20,22) extending parallel to a ground plane (44), which 

members are L-shaped and can be provided in advantageously 
miniaturised form. Two such antenna members (20,22) can be provided 

on the same ground plane (44) so as to achieve antenna diversity and 
switch means (30) are provided for switching between the antenna 

member (20,22) in a receive mode, and for switching to only one of 
said antenna members (20,22) for operation of the apparatus in a 

transmit mode. The switch means (30) is arranged to ground a feed 
connector (18,36,38) of the antenna member (20,22) that is not selected 

for transmission or reception so as to render that antenna member 
(20,22) passive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to antenna apparatus for use in a
radio communication system.Wireless communication is well known for communication over
large distances and also where the communicating devices require a
high degree of mobility. More recently, wireless communication has
been employed for communication between personal computers (PCs)
forming part of a local area network (LAN). To provide wireless
connection to the LAN, the PC has to be equipped with an appropriate
network interface card (NIC) and a radio modem which can be
integrated into the NIC or connected to the NIC, by means of an
appropriate cable. An antenna forms an integral part of the modem.
Due to the use of small-size PCs, which have standard slots such as
those proposed by the Personal Computer Memory Card Association
(PCMCIA), reductions in the size of the NIC and modem, and thus the
antenna, are required.Known antenna apparatus such as the Plated Inverted-F Antenna
(PIFA), which comprises a rectangular plate having a feed pin and
ground pin connecting it to antenna circuitry and the ground plane
respectively, is disadvantageous in that it is too large for use in
applications of the above-mentioned nature and a simple reduction in the
size of the rectangular plate leads to the significant degradation of
performance in terms of operational bandwidth and/or gain. Also, the
rectangular plate limits the area in which other RF components can be
mounted since there is not enough space to mount the components
beneath the rectangular plate.It is an object of the present invention to provide an antenna
apparatus in which the antenna means occupy a reduced amount of
space while exhibiting a satisfactory gain and bandwidth. U.S.-A-4 083 046 discloses an antenna apparatus for use with a ground
plane and an antenna circuit. There is disclosed an L-shaped transmission member.WO-A-91 02386 merely discloses the connection of antenna apparatus to
a ground plane.According to the present invention, there is provided antenna apparatus
as defined in claim 1. Advantageously, the antenna member of the present invention can
be formed from a sheet, the antenna member occupying less space than
a known PIFA with the same gain and operational bandwidth.Also, the antenna member is preferably of suitable dimensions
such that two such members can be provided along with power-stage,
and advantageously compact switching circuitry, in the same space as is
occupied by a single PIFA of the same gain and bandwidth. The
invention therefore also allows for the

An antenna apparatus for use with a ground plane (44) and an antenna circuit
(24), comprising:


a substantially L-shaped first antenna (20);
a substantially L-shaped second antenna (22); and
a switch (30) for selecting between (1) a first mode wherein said first antenna (20)
is electrically connected to the antenna circuit (24) so as to operate in a receiving mode

while said second antenna (22) is grounded so as to cause said second antenna (22) to
behave as a passive resonant circuit which is tuned to a frequency that is different from

the frequency of operation of the first antenna (20), and (2) a second mode wherein said
second antenna (22) is electrically connected to the antenna circuit (24) so as to operate

in a receiving mode while said first antenna (20) is grounded so as to cause said first
antenna (20) to behave as a passive resonant circuit which is tuned to a frequency that is

different from the frequency of operation of the second antenna (22).

antenna (22) are positioned relative to each other so as to form a substantially rectangular

member with central open portion (26).
The antenna apparatus of claim 1, wherein the first antenna (20) comprises:

a first portion (12) and a second portion (14) each extending parallel to the ground
plane (44) and positioned relative to each other so as to form a substantially L-shaped

member.
