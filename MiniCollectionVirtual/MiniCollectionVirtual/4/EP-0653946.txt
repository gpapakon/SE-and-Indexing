<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low flow rate nebulization method and a
low flow rate nebulizer apparatus used in respiratory care and, in particular, to a
continuously connected, continuous low gas flow rate liquid nebulizer useful in
respiratory care to deliver liquid medications.Critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation are often victims of
respiratory distress syndrome, status asthamaticus and pulmonary infections.
Treatment of these and other severe respiratory conditions includes medications
delivered directly to the lungs of the patient.Respiratory delivery of medication for these conditions is preferable to oral,
intravenous and subcutaneous delivery because it is non-invasive, permits rapid
action of medicament, requires a relatively small dosage, is not filtered through
the liver of the patient, and produces a low incidence of systemic side effects.Nebulized or aerosolized solutions are the preferred method of respiratory
delivery of medication; when fragmented into small particles, medicants are more
efficiently deposited near sites of medicant activity in the lung.Respiratory medications may be delivered to the lungs of the patient as an
aerosol of a liquid or a powder. Clinical aerosols are currently generated by jet or
ultrasonic nebulizers, metered dose inhalers (MDI) and dry powdered inhalers.Liquid nebulizers are well known in the art. Aerosolization of liquid
medications is performed by putting a liquid product in a chamber (nebulizer vial) 
that has a pressurized flow of gas through it. Utilizing the Bernoulli principle,
liquid is drawn through an aspirator tube into the path of a high velocity gas and is
fractured into a mist. The mist flows out of the nebulizer by inertial forces.There are two principal types of nebulizers for the delivery of liquid
medication to the lungs: jet nebulizers and ultrasonic nebulizers. In conventional
jet nebulizers, compressed gas from a compressor or hospital air line is passed
through a narrow constriction known as a jet. This creates an area of low
pressure, and liquid medication from a reservoir is drawn up through a feed tube
and fragmented into droplets by the airstream. Only the smallest drops leave the
nebulizer directly, while the majority impact on baffles and walls and are returned
to the reservoir. Consequently, jet nebulization takes several minutes to
complete, depending upon the initial volume.Important disadvantages of nebulizers include low lung deposition related
to the use of tidal breathing. A substantial portion
