<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lifting device (10) for disabled persons (12) which comprises at least one height-adjustable lever arm (24, 120) with at least one suspension point (26, 28, 132) for one end (30, 32, 134) of a tensile element (34) which can be placed under the armpits (40, 42) of the persons (12) to be lifted and/or transported. In order to ensure uniform transmission of forces upon the person during lifting or lowering and transporting it is proposed that the tensile element (34) be a resilient tube (34), or sections of such a tube, which can be filled with a fluid.

A lifting device (10) for handicapped persons (12), comprising at least one height-adjustable
lifting arm (24, 120) and a traction element (34) extending from it which

can be placed under the armpits (40, 42) of the person (12) to be lifted or transported,
characterized in that

the traction element is comprising an elastic hose (34) filled with a fluid, with
connection elements (62, 64) which are extending from the end of said hose and

leading to attachment points (26, 28) at the lifting arm (24, 120), and that the hose is
placed such that it is running under the armpits (40, 42) of the person (12) to be lifted

or transported, and it is filled with a fluid and can be deformed such that it is adaptable
over a large surface in the contact area to the body of the person.
A lifting device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

said hose (34) having a cross-section of preferably 5 cm to 20 cm which can be filled
with a gas, such as air, is consisting of a fiber material, such as polyamide, and is

sealingly coated with an elastomer or a smooth washable outer covering, respectively.
A lifting device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that

the ends (30, 32, 134) of said hose (34) are sealingly clamped between two strips
(44), and the ends (30, 32, 134) are pressed together and/or welded or glued by folds

(50, 52), wherein straps (54, 56) are provided at the ends (30, 32, 134) of the hose
(34), said straps being beaded into flat ends (30, 32, 134) of the hose (34), if necessary. 
A lifting device according to Claim 3,
characterized in that

the hose (34) has convexly curved end edges (50, 52).
A lifting device according to Claim 1 with a knee rest (130),
characterized in that

both, the lifting arm (120) as well as the knee rest (130) are extending from a support
(116) of the lifter adjustable in height by a motor gear device or a hand crank.
A lifting device according to Claim 5,
characterized in that

the support (110) is an elongated profiled section (114) such as a square tube, around
which a second elongated profile section (116) such as a square tube is disposed, said

second elongated profile section being displaceable in respect to the first elongated
profile section via a motor gear device (118), and that the axis (122) of the lifting

arm (120) and the knee rest (120) extend from the second elongated profiled section.
A lifting device (10) according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that

the suspension member (66, 68) is attached directly or indirectly to one end of the
traction element (34), wherein the suspension member (66, 68) has a recess (72)

which can be suspended via a nipple or hook disposed at the attachment point (26,
28, 69, 132).
A lifting device according to at least Claim 7,
characterized in that

said recess has an elongated hole (72) with a widening (74) for inserting a nipple
head (69) through it, wherein said elongated hole (72) has hole ends (74, 76) disposed

close to as well as remote from the traction element (34, 64), and said widening (74)
is disposed at a distance from the farther hole end (86) in such a way that during

tensile strain (82) on the traction element (34, 64) the nipple (69) rests against the 
farther hole end (76), and the nipple head (69) can only be displaced along the

elongated hole (72) to the nearer hole end (74) in a direction opposite the tensile
strain (82).
A lifting device according to at least Claim 8,
characterized in that

said elongated hole (72) is an angle with legs (78, 80), and said widening (74) is
arranged in the leg (78) which is closer to the traction element (64), and the suspension

member can be suspended over the nipple (69) such that the other leg (80) is
oriented vertically or obliquely upward in respect to the farther hole end, independently

of whether the tensile strain (82) of the traction element (64) is directed vertically
downward or horizontally from the attachment point (26, 28, 69, 132) toward the

person (12).
