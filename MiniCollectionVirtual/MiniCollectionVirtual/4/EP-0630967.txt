<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases which produce  gamma -CD to an increased extent in the conversion of starch or starch-like substrates into CD, characterised in that their protein sequence in the region between amino acid position 180 and amino acid position 240 contains the amino acid sequence Asn Leu Xaa Asp (SEQ. ID NO: 1), where position 1 of the protein sequence at the start of the signal peptide is CGTase and Xaa is a natural amino acid.

<CLAIMS>
Mutated cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase
(CGTase) from Bacillus sp. 290-3 or Bacillus circulans

which, when converting starch or starch-like substrates
to cyclodextrin (CD), produces γ-CD to an increased

extent, 
characterized in that
 its protein sequence, in
the region between amino acid position 180 and amino acid

position 240, contains the amino acid sequence Asn Leu
Xaa Asp (SEQ. ID NO: 1), where position 1 of the protein

sequence is the beginning of the signal peptide of the
CGTase and Xaa denotes Trp or Ser.
CGTase according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 Xaa denotes Trp.
Process for preparing CGTases, 
characterized in
that
 the DNA sequence of a gene encoding a β- or γ-CGTase
from Bacillus sp. 290-3 or Bacillus circulans is mutated

by means of mutagenesis methods which are known per se
such that the Tyr situated in the region between amino

acid positions 180 and 240 in the sequence motif Asn Leu

Tyr Asp (SEQ. ID NO: 9) of the β- or γ-CGTase employed is
thereby replaced in the mutated CGTase by another natural

amino acid.
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 the Tyr situated in the region between amino acid
positions 180 and 240 in the sequence motif Asn Leu Tyr

Asp (SEQ. ID NO: 9) of the β- or γ-CGTase employed is
replaced in the mutated CGTase by Trp or Ser.
Use of CGTases according to Claim 1 or 2 for
producing γ-cyclodextrin.
