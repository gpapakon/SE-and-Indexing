<ABSTRACT>
This torch for welding, or more particularly for transferred-arc plasma resurfacing, comprises an anode nozzle (1) surrounding a cathode (2) arranged along a longitudinal axis (3). An initiation plasma-generating gas flow (5) passes through the channel (4) of annular cross-section made between the anode nozzle (1) and the cathode (2). In addition, a directional plasma-generating gas flow (14) passes through a separate circuit (12, 13) and generates a deflection effect, so that the plasma is created and is propagated in a direction (10) making a significant angle (A) with the longitudinal axis (3) of the torch, especially a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (3) along which the cathode (2) is arranged, the plasma leaving through a lateral orifice (11). Such a torch is particularly suited to resurfacing (refilling) small bores.

Torch for welding or more particularly for 
transferred arc plasma build-up welding, comprising a 

nozzle/anode (1) coaxially surrounding a cathode (2), disposed 
along the longitudinal axis (3) of the torch, and a duct (4) 

with an annular cross section formed between the nozzle/anode 
(1) and the cathode (2) and suitable for having a flow of 

plasmagenic gas (5) pass through it, the torch being arranged 
so as to emit a jet of plasma in a direction (10) forming a 

significant angle (A) with respect to the longitudinal axis 
(3) of the torch, 
characterised in that
 there is provided, in 
addition to the initiating pl
asmagenic gas circuit (4, 22) 
running along the cathode (1), another circuit (12, 13, 25) 

distinct from the previous one, and suitable for having pass 
through it a directional flow of plasmagenic gas (14), the 

directional plasmagenic gas circuit opening out (at 13), along 
a direction (10) forming a significant angle (A) with the 

longitudinal axis (3) of the torch, into a chamber or a pipe 
(9) extending the duct (4) with an annular cross section, to 

the front of the torch and itself opening out on the outside 
through a lateral outlet orifice (11) of the nozzle/anode (1), 

so that the plasma is created and propagated in a direction 
which forms a significant angle with the longitudinal axis (3) 

of the torch, along which the cathode (2) is disposed. 
Transferred arc plasma torch according to Claim 
1, characterised in that the directional plasmagenic gas 

circuit (12, 13, 25) has, in its front part, a right-angled 
elbow (13), with a convergent part, opening out at the rear of  

 
the aforementioned chamber or pipe (9), so as to divert the 

plasma jet, in a direction (10) forming an angle of around 90Â° 
with respect to the longitudinal axis (3) of the torch, along 

which the cathode is disposed (2). 
Transferred arc plasma torch according to Claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the initiating plasmagenic gas 

circuit (4, 22) and the directional plasmagenic gas circuit 
(12, 13, 25) are each provided with their own gas flow control 

means, so that the control of the operating parameters of the 
plasma depends directly on the absolute and relative settings 

of the two plasmagenic gas circuits. 
Transferred arc plasma torch according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the nozzle/anode (1) 

is designed to be mounted on the holder (16) of a torch, 
comprising a cathode support block (17) in which the cathode 

(2) is held (at 26) so as to be able to be fitted, axially 
adjusted and removed from the rear part of the torch. 
Transferred arc plasma torch according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that part of a water-circulation 

cooling circuit (15) is housed in the area of the 
free end of the nozzle/anode (1), this area being made 

available by changing the direction of the plasma jet.
