<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressed flower
ornament containing a pressed flower(s) and capable of being
mounted in a frame for display.A traditional pressed flower ornament is fabricated by
setting a pressed flower assortment on a base board with an
adhesive or pieces of string and, if desired, enclosing it in
a transparent bag made of e.g. polyethylene.However, if the pressed flower assortment is not protected
with a bag or cover, it will quickly change or fade
in color and be stained with dust.Also, the pressed flower assortment has to be protected
in an appropriate size of the transparent bag. Otherwise,
its appearance will be impaired by gaps and wrinkles on the
transparent bag. If the airtightness in the transparent bag
is poor, the pressed flower assortment will gradually be
deteriorated and faded with time.It would be desirable to be able, in view of
the foregoing aspects, to provide an improved pressed flower
ornament which has a pressed flower assortment airtightly
sealed in between a transparent plate and a damp-proof base
board so that the pressed flower assortment remains intact
for long without changing or fading its colors. Also, the 
pressed flower ornament of the present invention can be mounted in a frame for display.EP-A-0 342 248 discloses a pre-dried pressed flower arrangement sealed in
between a transparent sheet and a base to which the sheet is adhesively attached along
its entire periphery.JP-A-5 065 000 discloses a pressed flower ornament in accordance with the pre-characterising
part of claim 1.The present invention provides a pressed flower ornament as set forth in claim
1.Preferred and optional features are set forth in the subsidiary claims.The invention will be described further, by way of example only, with reference
to the accompanying drawings, in which:

of the present invention;Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 2-2 of Fig. 1;Fig. 3 is an explanatory view showing the application of an adhesive agent to a
base board which supports a pressed flower assortment of the pressed flower ornament;Fig. 4 is an explanatory view showing the coupling of the base board to a
transparent plate;Fig. 5 is an explanatory view showing the pressed flower ornament of the first
embodiment mounted in a frame;Figs. 6 and 7 are explanatory views showing a second embodiment of the
present invention;Figs. 8 and 9 are explanatory views showing a third embodiment of the present
invention;Figs. 10
