<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a slide gauge with a large measuring range, in which the sleeve (2) can sweep over (cover) the entire measuring range. The sleeve (2) is provided with a material measure (3) and arranged in a linearly displaceable fashion on the measuring axis. The measuring force is applied by a special spring system which acts on a carriage (20) which is connected to the sleeve (2) and has relatively smaller displacement regions. The carriage can be decoupled from the sleeve (2) in such a way that the coupling between carriage (20) and sleeve (2) can be released by pressure on an actuating element (6), as a result of which the sleeve (2) can be displaced over the entire measuring range and can be displaced in a limited range after coupling of the carriage (20).
