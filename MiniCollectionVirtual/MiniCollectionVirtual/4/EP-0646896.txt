<ABSTRACT>
In order to generate a solid model from one plan view and one or a 
plurality of sectional views, input two-dimensional drawing data is 

classified into plan view data and sectional view data, and closed 
regions and inclusion relations among the respective closed regions are 

detected from the classified plan view data. Attributes of the detected 
closed regions are detected, and the detected closed regions are grouped 

into groups, each including closed regions of the same attributes based 
on the detected attributes of the closed regions. The sectional view 

data is divided on the basis of data on the detected closed regions. 
Some of the closed regions are three-dimensionalized based on the divided 

sectional view data. Closed regions not belonging to the three-dimensionalized 
portion of the closed regions but belonging to the same 

group as a three-dimensionalized closed region are three-dimensionalized 
by the same method as was used for the three-dimensionalized closed 

region. A solid model is generated by combining the three-dimensionalized 
closed regions through Boolean operations performed on 

the basis of the inclusion relation among the respective closed regions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and system for generating 
a solid model and, more specifically, to a method and system for 
generating a solid model from one plan view and one or a plurality of 
sectional views. Among prevailing methods of expressing a three-dimensional shape in 
drawings, there are a method using orthographic views and a method using 
sectional views. In the method using orthographic views, if local 
coordinates of a three-dimensional body as an object are determined, 
orthographic views can be uniquely obtained from those coordinates by 
projection to the XY-, YZ- and ZX-planes. Therefore, a method of 
constructing a three-dimensional wireframe structure from the 
orthographic views is established as an inverse transformation. In this 
connection, the present inventors have proposed a method of generating a 
solid model from a three-dimensional wireframe structure using a non-manifold 
model (Japanese Patent Application No. 4-268650). The present 
inventors have also proposed a method of constructing a solid model in an 
interactive manner from incomplete orthographic views (Japanese Patent 
Application No. 5-184244). However, in the method using sectional views, due to arbitrariness 
in taking sectional views, there exist infinite methods of making 
drawings even if the local coordinates of an object body are determined. 
Further, since sectional views usually include abbreviated expressions, 
an original three-dimensional shape cannot be constructed without using 
the knowledge of such abbreviated expressions in drawings. For the above 
reasons, it has been conventionally considered very difficult to provide 
a system of generating a solid model from drawings including an ordinary 
sectional view. Published Unexamined Patent Application (PUPA) No. 3-74784 
discloses a technique in which sectional views taken by projecting 
respective parts of a three-dimensional body in the vertical and 
horizontal directions are input, the respective parts in the input views 
are divided in accordance with a user's specification, an approximation  
 
to a hyper quadratic function is performed on contour data of the divided 
parts, ratios among values of parameters of respective functions in two 
input plan views are adjusted for the above-obtained function, and the 
respective parts are combined in a three-dimensional space based on a 
positional relationship among the centers of gravity of the respective 
parts in the two sectional views. However, this technique relates to a 
means for
