<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for inflating an air bag includes a 
container (12) for holding a stored supply of gas under 

pressure. A body (20) of gas generating material is 
disposed in a housing (22). A cup shaped closure member 

(24) blocks a flow of gas through an annular array of 
passages (28) formed in an end wall (58) of the container 

(12). The cup shaped closure member (24) has a frangible 
section (176). Upon ignition of the body (20) of gas 

generating material, the gas applies pressure against an 
end wall (166) of the closure member (24) to break the 

frangible section (176) of the closure member. The 
pressure applied by the gas against the end wall (166) of 

the cup shaped closure member (24) moves the closure member 
toward an opposite end of the container (12). Gas flows 

from the container (12) through the openings (28) in the 
end wall of the container into a diffuser (36). The 

diffuser (36), closure member (24) and housing (22) which 
holds the body (20) of gas generating material are all 

connected to the end wall (58) of the container (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inflator assembly 
for inflating a vehicle occupant restraint, such as an air 
bag. Known inflator assemblies use a combination of stored 
gas and gas generated by ignition of gas generating 
material to inflate an air bag. These inflator assemblies 
include an igniter which is activated to ignite the gas 
generating material. Upon ignition of the gas generating 
material, the generated gas provides fluid pressure which 
ruptures a disk to release the stored gas from the inflator 
assembly for flow to an air bag. The gas generated by 
ignition of the gas generating material can then also flow 
from the inflator assembly to the air bag. Inflator 
assemblies constructed in this manner are disclosed in U.S. 
Patents Nos. 3,806,153 and 3,895,821, which discloses the 
features defined in the preamble of claim 1. The present invention relates to an inflator assembly 
for inflating a vehicle occupant restraint, such as an air  
 
bag. The inflator assembly includes a container of stored 
gas. A housing is connected with the container and holds a 
quantity of material which produces pressure when at least 
partially ignited. An igniter for igniting the quantity of 
pressure producing material is disposed in the housing. 
The quantity of pressure producing material is preferably a 
body of gas generating material. A closure member is connected with the container. The 
closure member blocks a discharge opening for directing gas 
from the container. The closure member is cup shaped and 
thus has a closed end and an open end. The closure member 
at least partially encloses the housing for the quantity of 
pressure producing material. A diffuser is also connected 
with the container. The diffuser receives gas from the 
discharge opening and directs the gas to the vehicle 
occupant restraint. Upon activation of the igniter, the pressure producing 
material is ignited and produces gas pressure. This gas 
pressure is applied against the closed end of the cup 
shaped closure member and breaks a frangible section of the 
closure member. Breaking the frangible section of the 
closure member disconnects the closure member from the 
container. The gas pressure resulting from ignition of the 
quantity of pressure producing material moves the closure 
member away from the housing for the gas generating 
material. The gas from the quantity of pressure producing 
material mixes with and heats the stored gas. The stored  
 
gas and the gas from the quantity of pressure producing 
material flow
