<CLAIMS>
A shell catalyst containing 0.3 to 5% by weight of 
palladium, based on the dried catalyst, on an alkaline 

active carbon support obtainable by impregnation of the 
support with an aqueous palladium salt solution, precipitation 

of palladium and reduction, characterized in that 
dry active carbon showing an alkaline reaction with a pH 

value of at least 8 is impregnated with the palladium 
salt solution in the absence of an oxidizing agent and 

the supernatant liquid is separated off after it has 
reached a pH value of at least 1. 
A process for the production of a shell catalyst 
containing 0.3 to 5% by weight of palladium, based on the 

dried catalyst, on an alkaline active carbon support 
obtainable by impregnation of the support with an aqueous 

palladium salt solution, precipitation of the palladium 
and reduction, characterized in that dry active carbon 

showing an alkaline reaction with a pH value of at least 
8 is impregnated with the palladium salt solution in the 

absence of an oxidizing agent and the supernatant liquid 
is separated off after it has reached a pH value of at 

least 1. 
The use of the shell catalysts claimed in claim 1 
for the hydrogenation of unsaturated fats, oils, fatty 

acid esters and other fatty derivatives by catalytic 
hydrogenation with hydrogen.
