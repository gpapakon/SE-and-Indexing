<ABSTRACT>
A multi-electrode cardiac catheter (10) has pairs of electrodes (13) connected to sensing circuitry (31, 32, 40) to produce a differential signal. The sensing output is sharply defined and self normalizing. Preferably, a catheter ablation tip electrode (12) is an electrode of one pair, and the differential signal becomes non-zero when the tip contacts surrounding tissue. The shape of the differential signal provides information on the degree of electrode contact, as well as on the amount of locally-sensed tissue impedance change. The signal may be used as a trigger enable signal for a cardiac ablation catheter (10), and the applied level of RF power may be controlled based on the indicated degree of electrode contact and value of tissue impedance.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ABLATION CATHETER POSITIONING SYSTEMThe present invention relates to electrode-bearing catheters, and more particularly to catheters of the type which are inserted along a blood vessel in order to position its electrodes in the region of a patient's heart. The electrodes may be used for sensing cardiac electrical signals, applying electrical stimulation for diagnostic testing or the like, or applying treatment signals, such as tissue ablation signals. The catheter may include other structures, such as a lumen and a delivery system, for applying light, thermal energy or chemical agents, or a sampling system for sampling tissue, forming images of tissue or withdrawing a specimen of the surrounding fluid.To position such an electrode-bearing catheter at a desired site within the patient's body, one or more catheter insertion and radiographic visualization steps are usually required in the course of bringing the catheter to its general target area. Once the catheter has been placed in position, further control and interaction by the surgeon is generally required to assure that the catheter is precisely positioned and properly oriented to perform its intended functions.For example, when the catheter is an RF tissue ablation or coagulation treatment catheter, it may be necessary to perform various preliminary electrical measurements or mapping operations to assure that the power electrode has moved into contact with a specific tissue region that is to be treated, such as a cardiac lesion, that is initiating arrhythmias.Among the prior art known to applicant, one cardiac catheter of this type is configured as a special purpose mapping catheter, and utilizes a multi- electrode structure to generate characteristic tissue impedance responses at different tissue sites, from which the relative position of the catheter can be determined. Specifically, U.S. Patent 4,9 M ,174 shows such an electrode structure wherein the impedance is measured by successive pairs of electrodes to detect when an electrode has advanced beyond a blood/tissue interface. An abrupt shift in phase of the detected impedance is noted at the electrode positioned by the interface. The device of that patent appears to be intended for the very specific purpose of determining the size of a patient's ventrical, or more precisely, positioning a catheter having a plurality of surface ring electrodes in the ventrical in such a way that the relative locations of the electrodes are known and it 

becomes possible to map an impedance distribution from
