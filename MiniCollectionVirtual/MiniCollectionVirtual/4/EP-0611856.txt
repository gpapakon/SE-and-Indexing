<ABSTRACT>
A frame assembly for a temporary stairway comprises a 
platform (1) formed of a substantially E-shaped frame 

and a correspondingly substantially E-shaped auxiliary 
frame (2) slidingly engagable therewith. The frame 

forming the platform (1), and the auxiliary frame (2) 
can be fixed at predetermined positions so as to expand 

or contract the frame assembly to a desired width. 
Hanging means (8) are provided at the corners of the 

frame assembly for connecting a series of assemblies 
together in a stack by flexible connection means (8) to 

form a temporary stairway. A ladder (4) is pivotally 
attached to each frame assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a frame assembly for 
constructing a temporary stairway which can be used e.g. 
at a building construction site and the like by hanging 
on the wall of a building or at a subway construction 
site or at various civil engineering sites by hanging on 
the surface of a vertical shaft and the like. Hitherto, a temporary ladder has been used at 
construction sites of buildings, or in vertical shafts 
at subway construction sites or in various civil 
engineering works in order to provide a stairway for 
workers moving between ground level and a working place. The inventor(s) of the present invention have already 
provided a ladder device which can be used at a building 
construction site by hanging on the wall surface of the 
building, and another type of ladder which can be used 
by hanging from ground level into an underground working 
place (see Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 
143060/1983 and Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 
18022/1984). The aforementioned ladder devices provided by the 
inventor(s) of the present invention are very easy to 
handle because they can be simply placed at the 
construction site of a building and the like by hanging 
thereof on the outer surface of the building and can be 
stored and transported by stacking on each other after 
use. However, the ladder devices provided by the inventor(s) 
of the present invention cannot be used under some  
 
circumstances at various construction sites because the 
ladder devices are constructed with frame parts of fixed 
size which only serve for use with certain scaffolds. That is, in some cases, the ladder devices cannot be 
adapted to a hanging beam placed above the device at a 
particular construction site or they are too large to 
place at another construction site. Therefore, it has been thought hitherto that various 
frame assemblies of different sizes should be prepared. 
However, the preparation of many frame parts of 
different sizes is not economical because the frame 
parts are difficult to manufacture and need more storage 
space and so on. Viewed from one aspect, the present invention provides 
a frame assembly for a temporary stairway, comprising 
a platform having a substantially E-shaped frame, a 
ladder turnably attached at its upper end to one side of 
the platform and a walking surface formed along the 
other side of the platform and formed between the upper 
end of the ladder and the end of the platform on said 
one side, a substantially E-shaped auxiliary frame 
facing said

<CLAIMS>
a frame assembly for a temporary stairway, 
comprising a platform (1) having a substantially E-shaped 

frame, a ladder (4) turnably attached at its 
upper end to one side (1a) of the platform (1) and a 

walking surface (3) formed along the other side (1c) of 
the platform (1) and formed between the upper end of the 

ladder (4) and the end (1b) of the platform (1) on said 
one side (1a), a substantially E-shaped auxiliary frame 

(2) facing said platform frame (1) and slidingly 
engageable therewith, fixing means (9,10,11,12) for 

fixing the frames at a predetermined position of sliding 
engagement and hanging means (7) at the outer corners of 

the frames (1,2) for connecting via flexible connection 
means (8) to like assemblies above and below. 
A frame assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
substantially E-shaped platform frame (1) is formed of 

hollow tubular members (1b, 1d) which are adapted to 
receive the corresponding members of the substantially 

E-shaped auxiliary frame (2). 
A frame assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the auxiliary frame (2) can be fixed with 

respect to said platform (1) at a plurality of 
predetermined positions of sliding engagement, a series 

of corresponding apertures (9,12) being formed in the 
arms of the substantially E-shaped frames (1, 2) so that 

the frames can be fixed at a selected predetermined 
position by fixing means (10) engaged in said apertures. 
A frame assembly as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the platform (1) and the auxiliary frame (2) are 

each provided with a downwardly extending spacer (6) at 
each outside corner, and locating means (6a) above each 

spacer (6) for engagement with a like downwardly 
 

extending spacer (6) of a like frame assembly above in a 
collapsed, stacked condition. 
A frame assembly as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein said hanging means (7) includes a securing means 

(7a, 17) engageable with a like hanging means (7) on an 
adjacent like frame assembly via a short flexible
