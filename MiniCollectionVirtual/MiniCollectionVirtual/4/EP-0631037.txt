<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat exchanger with built-in (integrated) filter. The heat exchanger comprises a casing (10) delimited by a cylindrical wall (12) which is symmetric about an axis (XX), a first end wall (14) and a second end wall (16); a cylindrical partition (44) extending from the first end wall (14) up to close to the second end wall (16) in order to define a communication passage (50) causing a first chamber (54) of a heat-exchanger compartment (48) to communicate with a filtration compartment (46) containing a filter cartridge (40), the first chamber (54) being used for the circulation of a first fluid (F1) which is in heat exchange with a second fluid (F2) circulating in a second chamber (56) of the heat-exchange compartment (48), the chambers (54 and 56) being separated by heat-exchange means (52) so that the fluid (F1) exchanges heat with the fluid (F2) and is then filtered by the cartridge (40). Application especially to the cooling and filtration of combustion engine lubrication oil.

A heat exchanger incorporating a filter, of the
type comprising:


a casing (10) bounded by a cylindrical wall (12)
symmetrical about an axis (XX), a first end wall (14)

and a second end wall (16).
a filter compartment (46) disposed in an axial region
of the casing containing a tubular filter cartridge

(40);
a heat exchange compartment (40) of annular
configuration, disposed between the filter compartment

(46) and the cylindrical wall (12) of the casing,
heat exchanger means (52) disposed in the heat
exchange compartment (48) so as to define therein a

first flow chamber (54) for a first fluid (F1) and a
second flow chamber (56) for a second fluid (F2),
and in which the first chamber (54) is in
communication, firstly with a first inlet (26) for the

first fluid (F1), and secondly with the filter
compartment (46), which communicates with a first

outlet (28) for the first fluid (F1), the said first
inlet (26) and the said first outlet (28) being

arranged on the first end wall (14) of the casing (10),
while the second chamber (56) is in communication with

a second inlet (30) and a second outlet (32) for the
second fluid (F2), which are arranged on the

cylindrical wall (12) of the casing, 
a cylindrical partition (44) extending from the first
end wall (14) to the vicinity of the second end wall

(16), thereby separating the first chamber (54) of the
heat exchange compartment (48) from the filter

compartment (46) and thus defining between them a
communication passage (50) for the first fluid (F1),

the said passage being situated in the region of the
second end wall (16),

characterised in that the heat exchange means include a
corrugated surface (52) of tubular configuration,

including a multiplicity of wall elements (60)
extending radially with respect to the axis (XX) of the

casing (10), and in that the first chamber (54) is
defined between the said corrugated surface and the

cylindrical partition (44), while the second chamber
(56) is defined between the said corrugated surface and

the cylindrical wall (12) of the casing.
A heat exchanger according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the filter cartridge (40) is
disposed coaxially inside the cylindrical portion (44)

and at a distance from the said partition, so as to
define an annular passage (58) for flow of the first

fluid (Fl), which has been delivered from the first
chamber (54) of the heat exchange compartment (48) via

the communication passage (50) and which is to pass
radially through the tubular filter cartridge (40).
A heat exchanger according to Claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that the wall elements (60) are joined
together in pairs, alternately at the radially inner

side and the radially outer side, by rounded wall
portions (62, 64), and in that each wall element (60) 

includes press-formed portions (66) in the form of
bosses.
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that it includes a cover plate (18)
mounted removably on the second end wall (16) of the

casing for replacement of the tubular filter cartridge
(40).
