<ABSTRACT>
A memory controller which makes maximum use of any 
processor pipelining and runs a large number of cycles 

concurrently. The memory controller utilizes different 
speed memory devices at each memory devices optimal 

speed. The functions are performed by a plurality of 
simple, interdependent state machines, each responsible 

for one small portion of the overall operation. As 
each state machine reaches has completed its function, 

it notifies a related state machine that it can now 
proceed and proceeds to wait for its next start or 

proceed indication. The next state machine operates in 
a similar fashion. The state machines responsible for 

the earlier portions of a cycle have started their 
tasks on the next cycle before the state machines 

responsible for the later portions of the cycle have 
completed their tasks. The memory controller is 

logically organized as three main blocks, a front end 
block, a memory block and a host block, each being 

responsible for interactions with its related bus and 
components and interacting with the various other 

blocks for handshaking. The memory system includes a 
single chip which provides all of the address and 

control signals to a memory device so that a clock 
cycle can be saved because of reduced skew of the 

signals. The signals are provided synchronously from 
the chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to memory controllers used 
with computers, and more particularly to memory 
controllers providing address, RAS, CAS and write 
enable signals to DRAMs. Microprocessor-based computer systems have been 
increasing in performance at a tremendous rate. Much 
of this increase has been based on the improvements in 
the microprocessor itself. For example, clock speeds 
are reaching those previously used only by mainframe 
computers. However, affordable memory device 
performance has not been increasing at the same rate. 
Indeed, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) performance 
has flattened out recently, with the majority of the 
effort being concentrated on increasing device storage 
size. Thus main memory has become a bottleneck. Cache memory systems, where a small amount of very 
fast, expensive static RAM is used to store copies of 
the data, have made the problem somewhat less severe, 
but the designs are very complicated and expensive. 
Further, the poor memory performance returns when 
access must be made to main memory. So there still is 
a need to improve the performance of the main memory 
system. Page mode memory devices provide one way to 
increase memory system performance. If consecutive 
accesses are made to the same row address, referred to  
 
as the same page, only column addresses need be 
provided. This allows a dramatic reduction in cycle 
time for those cases, referred to as page hits. This 
is a quick gain and relatively easily made by itself, 
but more performance is always desired. In many processors, the address is provided before 
the data portion of the cycle. This is referred to as 
pipelining and allows a performance increase in the 
memory systems. All of the address decoding can be 
started before the data portion begins, so that 
partially parallel operations can occur. In most cases this overlap is somewhat minimal, 
one or two clock cycles, as the related systems cannot 
handle much more complexity. For example, the memory 
controller is conventionally built as a synchronous 
controller, based on a major state machine to control 
events and advancing on the processor clock edge. As 
the complexities of the microprocessor and the computer 
system increase, the conventional memory controller 
design becomes very limiting. It is exceedingly 
difficult to build a major state machine to handle all 
the possible cases. The complexity is daunting, if not 
overwhelming. As a result, numerous potential 
performance improvements have to be limited. Usually
