<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming cotton wool articles, e.g. 
cotton wool balls, pleats or pads, comprises forming the 

articles from a web derived from a carding machine (1) the 
input to which consists of discreet lengths of coloured 

cotton wool lap (3,4,5) fed to the carding machine in an end-to-end 
sequence. The effect of the carding machine is to blur the 

changes in colour which occur as each successive lap is 
delivered to the carding machine with the result that the 

final product exhibits a gradual transition in colour. The 
resultant product is aesthetically more pleasing than prior 

art multi-coloured cotton wool products which exhibit 
sudden transitions in colour and enables multi-coloured 

products to be manufactured continuously on a single 
machine line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of
multi-coloured cotton wool products, for example cotton
wool balls, cosmetic pads, and cotton wool pleats.In order to enhance the aesthetic appeal of
cotton wool/wadding products it has been common for many
years, especially with cotton wool balls, to mix carded
cotton balls of different colours prior to final packing in
polyethylene bags. This has been done by producing cotton
wool balls from separate but adjacent card lines each fed
with two laps of a different colour. Typically a single
card is fed with two half width laps (each about 500mm
wide) from a modified scutcher. All the laps of each
colour were, of course, run off together from the scutcher
at the same time. Each of the two slivers from the card
were fed through a ball making line so that the cotton
balls fell onto a passing conveyor. In this way the
finished bag of cotton wool balls contained a mixture of
colours in proportion to the number of different colours on
the ball lines.A method according to the pre-characterising part
of the main claim is known from DE-A-1937826. The document
discloses a method in which the same principle of using
narrow laps arranged side-by-side has been used on one or
more cards to produce cotton wool rolls or pleats
comprising more than one colour. Currently for cosmetic
pads 
(squares or discs), where the objective is to produce
different coloured cotton wool discs in polythene bags, it
is the practice to pack the bags subsequent to the punch
line in three separate operations. The bags are one third
filled with the first colour, then put to one side until
all the carded rolls of the first colour are used up. The
punch line is then fed with carded laps of a second colour
and the bags filled with one third of that colour and the
cartons of bags put to one side. When the carded laps of
the second colour are used up, the laps of the third colour
are introduced and the bags filled with the final colour
and passed for final packing into the shelf and/or transit
cartons.This process is obviously labour intensive
because the bags have to be handled by the packing
operatives three times. The process is therefore more
expensive than when single colours are produced.One objective of using different coloured cotton
wool has been to produce a "rainbow" effect of different
colours. However, with cosmetic pads especially, it has
only been possible to produce a sudden rather than a
gradual change of colour.A primary effect of the current invention is
to produce cotton wool
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of producing articles of cotton wool
comprising feeding cotton wool laps of different colours to

a carding machine (1); carding the laps to produce a web of
carded fibres; and forming the articles from the web,

characterised in that successive discreet lengths of the
cotton wool lap are fed end on to a licker-in (1b) of the

carding machine (1) and in that the carded fibres of the
web thereby produced are arranged so that the transition

from one colour to the next is blurred.
The method of claim 1 wherein the assembly of the
discreet lengths of lap is under program control.
The method according to claim 2 wherein the
program control produces a repeatable sequence of lap

portions for feeding to the carding machine (1).
A method according to any preceding claim wherein
the web produced by the carding machine (1) is treated by a

lapping or layering machine prior to formation of the
articles in order to produce further variations in the

mixing or blending of the coloured fibres.
Apparatus for producing articles of cotton wool
from cotton wool laps using a method according to any one

of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that separate unwinding
stations (3,4,5) are arranged in an end-to-end relationship

on a common conveyor (2) extending from said unwinding
stations (3,4,5) to a carding machine(1).
Apparatus according to claim 5 wherein the
carding machine (1) comprises a carding cylinder and a

licker-in (1b) and wherein the peripheral speed of the 
carding cylinder is substantially higher than the

peripheral speed of the licker-in (1b).
Apparatus according to claim 6 wherein the
peripheral speed of the carding cylinder is approximately

twice the peripheral speed of the licker-in (1b).
Apparatus according to claim 7 wherein the
peripheral speed of the carding cylinder is approximately

500m/min.
