<ABSTRACT>
A connector assembly for interconnecting microwave integrated circuit modules where each module has at least one microwave interconnection pins and one DC power pin. A groundplane (28) supports the mounting surfaces (32) of the modules (10) and has a plurality of holes (38, 40) for receiving the interconnection pins (18) and the DC power pins (22) of the modules. A conducting layer (78) opposite the mounting surface of the groundplane receives microwave signals from the interconnection pins extending down through it and communicates these signals between different modules. Resilient bellows and stripline are used to ensure matched impedances and secure microwave connections. The DC power pins extend through the conducting layer and isolating groundplane (87) and a DC power grid board (88) where an electrical connection is made with each DC power pin. The DC power pins are held in place in the power grid board using spring sockets so that the modules are installed on the connector assembly simply by inserting the pins into the respective holes and removed simply by pulling the modules away from the connector assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the field of microwave
communications integrated circuitry and more particularly to a multiple layer
assembly for connecting microwave integrated circuit modules.In particular, the present invention relates to a multiple
layer connector assembly for supplying power to and for
interconnecting microwave integrated circuit modules, each
module having at least two microwave interconnection pins and
at least two power pins extending from the module, said
assembly comprising: a groundplane having a mounting surface
for supporting mounting surfaces of the modules, having a first
plurality of holes for receiving the interconnection pins and
having a second plurality of holes for receiving the power pins
of the modules; a first conducting layer on the side of the
ground plane opposite the mounting surface of the groundplane
for receiving microwave signals from the interconnection pins
extending through the groundplane, and for communicating
signals between interconnection pins of different modules; a
second conducting layer on the side of the ground plane
opposite the mounting surface of the groundplane for
distributing power to the power pins, the second conducting
layer having holes for receiving the power pins.Such a multiple layer connector assembly is known from EP-A-222
188.In many applications including communications satellites, Microwave
Integrated Circuits (MlC's) and Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits
(MMIC's) are typically packaged in custom built module assemblies composed
of microstrip substrates supported by machined Kovar and aluminum parts.
These individual module assemblies are grouped together in a machined
aluminum chassis to perform more complex functions. The machined
aluminum chassis is a complex array of radio frequency circuit cavities, DC
wiring channels and precision mounting bosses, typically custom designed for
each application. The resulting assembly is complex, expensive and capable
of achieving only those functions which are designed into it.A less expensive approach is shown, for example, in U.S. Patent No.
4,745,381, to Kosugi, et al. in which the microwave integrated circuitry is
packaged in discrete modules which have a pair of direct current (DC) power
supply pins extending from the modules and a pair of interconnection pins
which allow the modules to be coupled together to form more complex devices
such as amplifiers and signal processing circuits. The modules are mounted
to a wall and connected together either with individual
