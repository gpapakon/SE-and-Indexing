<ABSTRACT>
With this method, accurate direct arrival at a floor can be achieved without travel at creep speed being necessary. Here, the car is controlled as a function of displacement in the deceleration phase, for which purpose a control range (CS) is formed which is divided into percentage values. The percentage values are put into tabular form in relationship to measured actual displacement values. When a certain actual displacement value occurs, the corresponding percentage value is multiplied by the value of the control range (CS) and if need be a control deviation (CO) and a pilot-control signal (SO) are added to the product, the sum forming the actual control signal (S) used in each case during the deceleration phase, which control signal (S) is fed to a control-valve arrangement.

Method for the control of an hydraulic lift, wherein a regulating equipment (20) with
the aid of a measuring sensor (11), which stands in connection with a cage (1) of the lift,

produces control signals (S), which are fed to a regulating valve arrangement (13), which
regulates the throughflow of a pressure fluid in such a manner that the cage (1) is

accelerated in upward or downward direction, moved at operating speed and retarded on
the arrival of a shaft information signalling the brake application point, wherein the

measuring sensor (11) receives travel signals and the cage (1) is regulated in dependence
on travel in the retardation phase, wherein a first value of the control signal (S) is

ascertained and stored in the starting instant of the cage (1) after the input of a travel
command, a second value (S2) of the control signal (S) of the regulating equipment (20) is

stored on the arrival of the brake application signal, and a control range is formed by the
difference of the second and first value of the control signal, characterised in that actual

travel values (si) are produced from the travel signals during the retardation phase, each
actual travel (si) is associated with a percentage value (%S) of the control range, the

percentage values (%S) are multiplied by the value of the control range and the thus
ascertained product determines the magnitude of the control signal (S) used during the

retardation phase.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that a signal, which represents
the setting of the main piston (32 or 32') and is preferably derived at a spring (37 or 37')

coupled to the piston rod (33 or 33'), serves as restoring signal.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that a control deviation (CO)
and a preliminary control signal (SO) are added to the product determining the control

signal, wherein CO is found according to the relationship 
CO = S2 - SO - CS
 and wherein
S2 is the second value of the control signal, SO is the preliminary control signal and CS is

the control range and the sum thus ascertained represents the control signal (S) used
during the retardation phase.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby, that the
hysteresis value (H) is ascertained during a learning travel, during which the control signal

(S) is increased until the speed reaches a preset value, the intensity of the control signal 
(S) is measured and stored on reaching the preset value, the control signal (S) is

thereafter increased further and after a while decreased again until the preset value of the
speed is reached again, the intensity of the control signal (S) is measured once again and

a difference, which represents the hysteresis value (H), is formed from the two measured
values.
Method according to claim 3, characterised thereby, that the preliminary control
signal (SO) is ascertained during a learning travel, during which the coil of the regulating

valve arrangement (13) is acted on by a control signal (S) rising in steps until the cage (1)
starts off and wherein the control signal ascertained in that case is reduced by a constant

value and stored as preliminary control signal (SO).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby, that a limit
control signal (SL) is ascertained during a learning travel, during which the coil of the

regulating valve arrangement (13) is acted on by a control signal (S) rising in steps until
the speed of the cage (1) no longer rises.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby, that the cage
(1) is driven unregulated during the travel preceding the retardation phase, for which the

speed is limited upwardly by the design of hydraulic components, such as for example a
pump (45).
Equipment for the performance of the method according to the claims 1 to 7, with a
regulating equipment (20), which controls a regulating valve arrangement (13), and with a

measuring sensor (11) which stands in connection with the cage (1), wherein the
regulating equipment (20) comprises at least one tacho-signal converter (22), wherein the

measuring sensor (11) is connected to the input of the tacho-signal converter (22), and the

regulating equipment (20) furthermore comprises a travel regulator (25), characterised
thereby that the travel regulator at its input is connected with an output of the tacho-signal

converter (22) delivering actual travel values (si) and at its output stands in connection with
the regulating valve arrangement (13) during the retardation phase, that the travel

regulator (25) comprises a table (26), in which associations of actual travel values (si) with
percentage values (%S) of a control range are stored, that a multiplier (25.1) is

provided, the one input of which is connected with the table (26), whilst the other input is 
acted on by the value of the control range , and the output of which forms the output

of the travel regulator (25).
Equipment according to claim 8, characterised thereby, that a regulating valve
arrangement (13) comprises a stroke force restoration preferably produced by means of a

compression spring (37, 37').
Equipment according to claim 8, characterised by a regulating equipment (20) with
a digital travel regulator (25).
