<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a processing head (1) for a laser engraving or cutting device, more particularly, for processing die plates, having a closed housing in which the processing head fitted with a lens holder (2) can be controllably moved in relation to a support holding a workpiece. The processing head has a bell (6) connected to a dust-suctioning device, said bell ending at a distance from the surface of the workpiece. The processing head is fitted with at least two gas blower nozzles (8). One of the gas blower nozzles (7) is directed at an angle towards the vertically incident laser beam (L) of the same whereas the other gas blower nozzle (8) that is also inclined at an angle in relation to the laser beam (L) is directed at a point (P') on the surface of the workpiece that is distant from the point of incidence (P) of the laser beam.

<CLAIMS>
Machining head (1) for a laser engraving or cutting
apparatus, in particular for machining die plates, which

comprises a closed housing in which the machining head with a
lens holder and with a gas blow nozzle (8) is movable relative

to a support carrying a work piece, wherein the head comprises
a bell (6) which is connected to an extractor (6') for dust

and which ends at a distance from the work piece surface,

characterised in that
 the machining head (1) is equipped with
at least two gas blow nozzles (7, 8) of which one gas blow

nozzle (7) is directed at an angle to the vertically impinging
laser beam (L) onto the point of impingement (P) thereof,

whereas the other gas blow nozzle (8), which is also inclined
at an angle to the laser beam (L), is directed onto a point

(P') of the work piece surface which is located at a distance
from the point of impingement (P) of the laser beam.
Machining head according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the nozzles (7, 8) are directed at an angle of 40-80Â° to the
laser beam axis.
