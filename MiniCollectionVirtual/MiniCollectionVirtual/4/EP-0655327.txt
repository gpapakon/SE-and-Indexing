<ABSTRACT>
In an inking device for a gravure rotary printing machine, the contact pressure of an inking roller (3) is kept constant during the inking operation of a gravure forme cylinder (4) without any hydraulic or pneumatic pressure effect. This takes place due to the fact that second ends (9) of lever arms (8), whose first ends (11) bear the inking roller, are connected in each case to one end (21) of a torsion bar spring (12) which is fixed to the ink fountain.

<CLAIMS>
Inking unit for gravure printing, having an ink trough (2)
with a forme cylinder (4) dipping into it and an inking roller

(3), the inking roller (3) being rotatably mounted at first ends
(7) of lever arms (8), and second ends (9) of the lever arms (8)

being pivotably mounted within the ink trough (2) and being in
each case frictionally and positively connected to a first end

(11) of a spring (12), and the inking roller (3) being in rolling
contact with the lateral surface of the forme cylinder (4),

characterized in that the springs (12) are constructed as a
preloadable torsion bar spring (12), in that a second end (21)

of the torsion bar spring is fixed in an abutment (22, 23) fixed
to the ink trough.
Inking unit for gravure printing according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the abutment (22, 23) comprises a

crossmember (23) fixed to the ink trough and having a bearing
block (22), in that the bearing block (22) is frictionally and

positively connected to the second end (21) of the torsion bar
spring (12).
Inking unit for gravure printing according to Claims 1 and

2, characterized in that the first end (11) of the torsion bar
spring (12) is frictionally and positively connected, in a manner

such that it can be firmly clamped, to the second end (9) of the
lever arms (8), the second end being held in a bearing block (17)

fixed to the ink trough.
Inking unit for gravure printing according to Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the lever arms (8) are limited in their

upward mobility by means of a stop (17, 29, 31).
Inking unit for gravure printing according to Claims 1 to
4, characterized in that the ink trough (2) is arranged in a 

manner such that its height can be adjusted by means of a support
(27) displaceable in a guide.
