<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of helically wound tire beads are made by 
winding them on a forming wheel (20) at two predetermined 

tension levels. The tension levels are generated by a 
braking pulley (5) and magnetic particle brake in conjunction 

with a programmable logic controller. The first few turns 
of wires (42) are made at a relatively low tension level. 

Subsequent turns are made at a higher tension level. The 
lower tension level contributes to longer life of the 

forming wheel assembly (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
forming tire beads, and more particularly to a method and
apparatus for forming a plurality of tire beads of either
strap or hex configuration while reducing wear and
resulting downtime on the bead making apparatus.For example, bead making machines such as those
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,902,083 include a forming
drum about which a wire is wrapped a plurality of times to
form the bead. The wire is maintained under tension to
obtain certain performance qualities in the tire bead.
Unfortunately, maintaining the requisite tension in the
wire while forming the bead tends to wear out certain
components of the bead making apparatus in a relatively
short time, requiring expensive downtime and repair.In current practice, each bead to be built has its own
individual wire presented to the bead making apparatus. A
rubber coating is extruded onto each wire at the extruder
and each individual rubber-coated wire is directed to the
bead making apparatus.A problem with this approach is that the chuck of the
bead making apparatus may misgrip the wire causing one or
more of the wires to come loose on the festoon all the way 
back to the extruder. In order to operate the bead making
apparatus again, the wire or wires must be restrung back
through the festoon.A more serious problem with current bead-making
apparatus is that since each wire is individually coated at
the extruder and each wire has its own set of festoon
pulleys, there is no way to use conventional pull rolls to
pull the wire out of the wire reels and through the
extruder. Instead, the forming wheel of the bead-making
apparatus grips the wires and pulls the wires from the let-offs
and through the extruder. This manner of pulling the
wires with the forming wheel contributes to three problems.First, forming wheel gripper life is extremely short
due to the fact that the gripper has to provide enough
force to pull the wires through the festoon, through the
extruder and out of the let-offs. Second, there is no way
to control winding wire tension. Third, because of the
nature of the individual wires and because the letoffs do
not need to stop between each set of beads being built, the
festoon must be powered when the bead builder finishes a
set of beads and is being unloaded prior to starting the
next set of beads. This necessitates a complex control
interplay between the bead unit and the festoon.The partial wrapping of a bead at different tension

<CLAIMS>
A method of making tire beads (42) on a
forming wheel (20) comprising:


a. attaching an end of a wire (42) to said
forming wheel (20); characterized by
b. initially winding said wire (42) around said
forming wheel by rotating said forming wheel a

predetermined number of turns, said initial winding being

at a first tension level in said wire (42), said first
tension level created by resisting said winding with a

gripper finger (22) and braking means (64) at a first
resistance level; and,
c. continuing said winding at a predetermined
second tension level, in said wire (42) greater than said

first tension level said second tension level created by
resisting said winding with said braking means (64) at a

second resistance level greater than said first resistance
level after said rotation of said forming wheel (20) said

predetermined number of turns whereby the increased
resistance of said braking means (64) is resisted by the

friction of the revolutions of wire (42) about the forming
wheel.
The method of making tire beads (42) of claim
1 further characterized by, prior to attaching said wire

(42) to said forming wheel (20), coating a plurality of
parallel wires (42) including said wire (42) with a

resilient rubber-like material and connecting said wires 
(42) with a web (44) of said material to form a ribbon

(12).
The method of making tire beads (42) of claim
1 further characterized by the step of continuously

controlling said tension in said wire (42) during winding
of said wire (42) around said forming wheel (20).
The method of claim 1 further characterized
by said first tension level being between 0 lbs (kg) and 5

lbs (2.23 kg) of force on said wire.
The method of claim 1 further characterized
by said second predetermined tension level being between 15

lbs (6.70 kg) and 30 lbs (13.39 kg) of force on said wire.
The method of claim 1 further characterized
by friction between said wire (42) and said forming wheel

(20)created by wraps of said wire (42) around said forming
wheel (20) anchoring said wire (42) to said forming wheel

(20) and resisting said second predetermined tension level.
