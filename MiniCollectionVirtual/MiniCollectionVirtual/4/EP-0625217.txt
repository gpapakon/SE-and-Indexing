<DESCRIPTION>
 CREEP RESISTANT ZIRCONIUM ALLOYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to alloys for use in light water nuclear reactor (LWR) core structural components and fuel claddings. More particularly, this invention relates to a zirconium alloy with second phase vanadium precipitates which are stable with respect to neutron exposure and high temperature exposure. Still more particularly, this invention relates to a zirconium alloy having stable second phase vanadium precipitates, while containing tin levels below that of conventional zirconium alloys and various additional alloying elements. This alloy is designed to function at high coolant temperatures and discharge burn-ups and to provide acceptable levels of creep resistance, neutron cross section, corrosion resistance, hydrogen uptake and fabricability.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTZirconium alloys are used in fuel rod claddings and in fuel assembly structural components of nuclear reactors (e.g., guide or thimble tubes, grid strips, instrument tubes, and so forth) because they exhibit a low neutron cross section, good corrosion resistance against high pressure/high temperature steam and water, and good mechanical strength and fabricability. Zirconium alloys, particularly those commonly known as Zircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4, have also been used in LWR cores because of their relatively small capture cross section for thermal neutrons. "Zircaloy" is a common name for zirconium-tin alloys. Zircaloy- 

4, for example, has 0.18 to 0.24 percent by weight (wt%) iron, 0.07 to 0.13 wt% chromium, oxygen in the range of from 1000 to 1600 ppm, 1.2 to 1.7 wt% tin, and the remainder zirconium.The addition of 0.5 to 2.0 wt% niobium, up to 1.5 wt% tin and up to 0.25 wt% of a third alloying element to zirconium alloys for purposes of corrosion resistance in the reactor core is suggested in U.S. Patent No. 4,649,023 as part of a teaching for producing a microstructure of homogeneously disbursed fine precipitates of less than about 800 A. The third alloying element is a constituent such as iron, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium, copper, nickel and tungsten.U.S. Patent No. 5,023,048 describes a fuel rod comprising a cladding tube having an inner tubular layer and an outer surface layer composed of differing zirconium alloys. The inner tubular layer is made from a conventional zirconium alloy such as Zircaloy-4. The outer surface layer is made from a zirconium alloy containing 0.35 to 0.65 wt% tin, 0.2 to 0.65 wt% iron, 0.09 to 0.16 wt% oxygen, and 0.35 to 0.65 wt% niobium
