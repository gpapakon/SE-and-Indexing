<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coated particles 
for use in cosmetic and toiletry formulations. The present invention provides metal oxide 
particles having a dye lake precipitated onto their 
surface in a dye lake:metal oxide ratio of between 10:90 
and 80:20. It has been found that water soluble dyes can be 
used to colour metal oxide particles by a process known 
as laking. A dye lake is an insoluble precipitate 
formed by reaction of a metal ion with a water-soluble 
dye, which can be precipitated onto the surface of a 
substrate. In the present invention the said metal 
oxide particles act as the substrate onto which the dye 
lake can precipitate. Dyes which act in this respect include azo dyes, 
triphenylmethane dyes, anthraquinone dyes, indigoid 
dyes, quinoline dyes, pyrazole dyes, xanthene dyes, 
fluoran dyes and azine dyes, examples of which are 
included in Table 1.

excellent brightness, colouring power, binding power and 
fastness. The pigments disclosed are inorganic 
particles with a high refractive index and comprise 
inter alia titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Such 
particles display luminosity which is caused by the 
reflection of visible light. To achieve luminosity the 
particles must be above a certain size, for example 
pigmentary grade titanium dioxide must have a mean 
primary particle size of at least 250 nm. EP-0266247 discloses coloured pigments particularly 
magnetic pigments such as oxides of titanium and zinc. 
For the reasons given above to act as pigments such 
particles must display luminosity and therefore be of a 
much greater size than the particles used in the present 
invention.

particles having a dye lake precipitated onto their 
surface in a dye lake:metal oxide ratio of between 10:90
