<ABSTRACT>
A microplate assembly (10) for use in analyzing 
samples captured on a filter 

medium (16) comprises a carrier plate (12), a holding tray (14), 
a collimator (18), and a cover film (20). 

These elements are generally rectangular in 
shape and are sized to stack on top of 

one another. The holding tray (14) is positioned 
within the carrier plate (12), the collimator (18) 

and filter medium (16) are positioned within the 
holding tray (14) with the filter medium (16) 

positioned beneath the collimator (18), and the 
cover film (20) is sealed over the collimator (18). 

To prepare samples in the microplate assembly (10) 
for analysis, the samples are captured 

on the filter medium (16) and the filter medium (16) 
is placed in the holding tray (14). After 

adding scintillation cocktail or luminescent 
substrate to the filter medium (16), the 

collimator (18) is placed over the holding tray (14) 
with the filter medium (16) positioned between 

the collimator (18) and the holding tray (14) and the 
samples disposed in the sample wells. 

The carrier plate (12), the holding tray (14), 
the filter medium (16), and the collimator (18) are provided 

with complementary keyed corners (22,34,19,46) to facilitate 
alignment of these elements relative to 

one another. The wells of the collimator (18) 
include respective lower rims (54) protruding 

into the filter medium (16) to minimize crosstalk 
through the filter medium (16). The cover 

film (20) seals the microplate assembly (10) so that 
the samples are prepared for analysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to multi-well sample trays which are 
commonly referred to as microplates and which are used to hold a large number 
(e.g., 24, 48, 96, or more) of samples in a standardized format to be assayed by 
various techniques such as autoradiography, liquid scintillation counting (LSC), 
luminometry, etc. In particular, the present invention relates to a microplate 
assembly and method which permits any filter medium chosen by a user to be placed 
in the microplate assembly for analysis and counting. Many microplate assays important in drug research, molecular biology, and 
biotechnology involve the binding or uptake of radioisotopic or luminescent tracers to 
target macromolecules or whole cells to form labelled complexes. Examples of 
microplate assays include DNA and RNA hybridizations (e.g., dot blots), enzyme 
activity assays (e.g., reverse transcriptase and kinases), receptor binding assays, and 
cell proliferation assays. A common feature of all these assays is that a labelled 
complex must be separated from any excess tracer that does not react with the target 
macromolecules or whole cells during the binding process. This is typically done by 
capturing or immobilizing the labelled complex on a suitable filter medium and 
washing away the unreacted tracer. Once separated, the material captured on the 
filter medium is typically assayed by autoradiography, liquid scintillation counting 
(LSC), or luminometry. In some cases, the filter medium is used to specifically bind 
the assay components, while in other cases the filter medium is used as a filtration 
medium. Assay performance is highly dependent on the type of filter material used, 
where typical filter materials include glass fiber, nylon, nitrocellulose, 
phosphocellulose, or other suitable material. Even differences in the same type of 
filter materials made by different suppliers may be subtle enough to adversely affect 
assay performance. One technique for assaying samples captured on a filter medium requires the 
individual samples to be cut from the filter medium and counted in individual  
 
scintillation vials using a liquid scintillation counter (LSC). A drawback of this 
technique is that the analysis and quantitation of bound samples immobilized on the 
filter medium requires time consuming sample preparation. In addition, this 
technique is expensive because the individual scintillation vials containing large 
volumes of scintillation fluid are discarded following use. Another technique for
