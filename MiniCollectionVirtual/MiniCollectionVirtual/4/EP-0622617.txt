<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a weighing machine and a method
of weighing an object.More particularly, the invention relates to
correcting the effects of lower-frequency floor
vibrations on weight signals generated and processed by such a
weighing machine.Floor vibrations usually have lower frequencies than the
vibrations caused by an object as it is placed on a weighing
machine to be weighed. Thus, it may be thought that a filter
can be used to eliminate such lower-frequency vibrations from
the weight signals, but the cutoff frequency of the filter
must be set low, and this makes the filtering time longer,
adversely affecting the speed of weight measurements. U.S.
Patent 4,624,331 disclosed a weighing machine having not only
a scale cell for measuring the weight of an object and
outputting a weight signal indicative of the measured weight,
but also a dummy cell set on the same floor as the scale cell 
such that the effects of the floor vibrations can be
eliminated from the weight signal by inverting the dummy
signal outputted from the dummy cell and adding it to the
weight signal from the scale cell. In this manner, the
cutoff frequency of the filter can be set higher, and hence
the weighing speed is not reduced.With a prior art weighing machine of this type, however, the
scale cell and the dummy cell must be set close to each other
because the floor at the positions of the two cells is assumed
to be vibrating under the same conditions. If the conditions
of vibrations are different at the positions of the cells,
corrections cannot be effected accurately by subtracting the
dummy signal of the dummy cell from the weight signal. There
may even be situations where the error becomes magnified by
the "correction". In short, the choice of the position for
installing the dummy cell becomes extremely limited, and the
degree of freedom in designing the weighing machine is
reduced. If there is not much free space in the neighborhood
of the scale cell, in particular, it is extremely difficult to
find an adequate place for installing the dummy cell for this
purpose. It now goes without saying that the difficulty of
this kind is magnified in the case of a combinational weighing
machine having a plurality of scale cells and calculating
combinations of weight signals therefrom to select a
particular combination satisfying a predetermined criterion 
because each of a large number (such as 10 or 14) of scale
cells will have to be provided with a dummy cell associated
therewith. Moreover, this has the adverse effects of
