<ABSTRACT>
On a plastics injection-moulding machine, fixed platen 11 and movable platen 12 are in connection with each other by means of levers 13, 13'' which are arranged transversely to the closing direction s-s and are arranged at different distances from the closing axis a-a. The connecting elements form with the levers 13, 13' a frame on which there is supported at least one closing (clamping) mechanism S both for closing the mould M and for applying the clamping forces. This achieves the effect that the forces occurring are led away outside the mould mounting space and nevertheless the highest requirements for the precision of the mould closure are met.

Plastics material injection moulding machine including a mould closing unit
having a stationary mould carrier (11) and a movable mould carrier (12),

between which a mould tool (M) is receivable and which are interconnected
via force transmitting means, which embrace at least two levers (13, 13', 13'',

61, 61') which are disposed substantially transversely relative to the closing
direction (s-s), which level ale interconnected via connecting elements which

are disposed at a variable distance (a-b) from a closing axis (a-a) formed
through the pivotal points of the levers and are approximately parallel relative

to the closing direction (s-s), the connecting elements and the levers (13, 13',
13'', 61, 61') together forming a frame, on which at least the one closing

device (S) is supported both for the closing of the mould tool (M) and for the
applying of the closing forces,

characterised in that connecting elements and levers together form a frame,
on which the mould carriers are disposed so as to be pivotal, pivotal parts

(pivotal bolts 36, 36', pivotal sockets 37, 37') being disposed so as to be
detachable from joints (31,31') of this pivotal connection.
Injection moulding machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the
mould closing unit is axially freely movable in the closing direction (s-s) except

for the stationary mould carrier (11).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the previous claims,
characterised in that at least one tension spar (14) penetrates the levers (13,

13') and is supported in retaining plates (17) which are supported on the
levers (13, 13') by nuts (18) (Figure 1a).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the previous claims,
characterised in that at least one tension spar penetrates the mould carriers

(11, 12) and/or the supporting element (16) and acts as a guide to the
movable mould carrier (12) and/or the supporting element (16).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the previous claims,
characterised in that the pivotal bearing arrangement of the tension spar (14)

embraces in each case two spherical segments (19), which are mounted on
the flat levers (13, 13'), the spherical segments having the same point of

rotation (Figure 5). 
Injection moulding machine according to one of the claims 1 - 4, characterised
in that the pivotal bearing arrangement of the tension spar (14) is provided

with two lock nuts (20), which tighten adjusting nuts (33') on the spherical
segments (19') (Figure 5a).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the previous claims,
characterised in that at the pivotal point of the levers (13, 13'), the closing unit

(S) engages an axially movable supporting element (16), which is guided on a
machine base (10).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the claims 1 - 6, characterised
in that at least one connecting element has spindle areas (14a, 15a), on which

spindle nuts (21, 22) are rotatable via driving means (23, 24), which are
supported on at least one lever (13) (Figure 6).
Injection moulding machine according to claim 8, characterised in that for the
closing of the mould tool (M) spindle nuts (21, 22) are actuated both on the

tension spar (14) and on the pressure spar (15), whilst for the generation of
the closing force the motor, disposed on the pressure spar (15), drives the

spindle nuts (22).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the claims 1 - 6, characterised

in that, for the generation of the closing force, a driving means (26) transfers
the pressure spar (15) from an inclined position into a horizontal clamping

position (Figure 8).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the claims 1 - 6, characterised
in that the pressure spar (15) is mounted via an eccentric (E) on the lever (13)

which provides the closing force when actuated.
Injection moulding machine according to claim 11, characterised in that the
bearing arrangements of eccentric (E), tension spar (14) and spindle (spindle

area 15a) lie approximately in a vertical axis (v-v).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the previous claims
characterised in that one of the connecting elements is the machine base

(10), on which the levers (13'', 61, 61') are pivoted.
Injection moulding machine according to claim 13, characterised in that the
connecting element further away from the closing axis (a-a) is the machine

base, the levers (13'', 61, 61') being pivoted on a bearing pin (59'), which is
mounted in openings (10a) in the machine base (10) (Figure 17).
Injection moulding machine according to claim 13 or 14, characterised in that
the levers (61, 61') are inserted loosely in a pair of guides (62, 62'), which is

configured as bearing element and is secured to the machine base (Figure
18). 
Injection moulding machine according to one of the previous claims,
characterised in that the closing device (S) is supported on the frame

approximately on the connecting straights between the connecting points of
levers, connecting elements or in the region of the movable mould carrier (12).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the previous claims,
characterised in that the distance between the stationary mould carrier (11)

and the movable mould carrier (12) is changeable via washer pieces 63,
which are insertable between pivotal parts and levers or the stationary mould

carrier or supporting element.
