<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to UHF radio transmission of measured values between consumption distributor devices (10) and a receiver circuit (1 - 6), assigned thereto, of a control centre (1 - 3, 5 - 9). So-called SAW components, that is to say surface acoustic wave resonators, are preferred as frequency-determining elements for the UHF transmitter circuits. With a view to possible, in particular temperature-induced frequency deviations of the UHF transmitters (10), the input of the receiver circuit (6) is maintained with a correspondingly broad bandwidth (Df). For interference suppression of external frequencies in this range (Df), there is now assigned to the receiver circuit (6) a scanner (3) which continuously scans the input band in a narrow-band (df) fashion in order to acquire signals which arrive from the consumption distributor devices (10) and which are as free as possible from external and interference signals.

A system for centrally acquiring energy consumption costs, such as heating and hot-water
costs in living spaces and/or business premises, the specific measuring place in question,

the consumption value which has accumulated in each case and optionally further
characterising data being signalled, through the transmission of encoded signals, by the

individual places of consumption to a central receiving place at which the transmitted
data from the individual measuring places is centrally acquired and optionally supplied to

the statement of account, an electronic consumption distribution device (10) being
associated with each measuring place and elaborating, adding up and electronically

storing a relative or absolute consumption value for the measuring place in question, and
an electronic parallel-to-serial converter being associated with the electronic consumption

distribution device (10) and converting the electronically recorded and encoded
consumption value into a sequential pulse train, a transmitter emitting electromagnetic

waves also being associated with the consumption distribution device (10) and being
switched, by the parallel-to-serial converter, in rhythm with the sequential pulse train

provided by the latter, and the electronic transmitting circuit having an acoustic surface-wave
element as a frequency resonator, and a receiver (6), which selects and receives

electromagnetic waves, being associated with the central receiving place and transferring
the transmitted electromagnetic sequential pulse signals to the central receiving place,

characterised in that the receiver comprises a receiver circuit (6) with wide-band input
(Df), with which a narrow-band (df) acting scanner circuit is connected in series, the input

bandwidth of the receiver circuit comprising the scattering width of the transmission
frequencies, of the consumption distribution devices, determined by the surface-wave

elements, and the frequency range which is aimed at by the scanner circuit moving to and
fro in this wide band range Df in a scanning manner.
A system in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the scanner circuit (3) is
compulsorily operative together with the receiver circuit (6) and can only be closed and

disconnected together with the latter (6).
A system in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that a UHF wide-band
amplifier (2) is associated with the scanner circuit (3). 
A system in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that the UHF wide-band amplifier
(2) has a non-linear amplifying characteristic.
A system in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that the amplifying characteristic
is approximately quadratic.
A system in accordance with any one of Claims 1 - 5, characterised in that the width of
the pass-band (Df) of the inputs of the wide-band amplifier (2) or alternatively the

receiver circuit (6) is determined by the magnitude of the maximum possible frequency
deviation of the surface-wave resonator from the desired value.
