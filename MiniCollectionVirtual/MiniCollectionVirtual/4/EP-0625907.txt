<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a chimeric mammal having a stable bone marrow graft of human hematopoietic cells capable of differentiating into multiple lineages of human mature cells, wherein at least 30 % of the hematopoietic cells in the mammal's bone marrow are of human origin. The inventive method comprises sublethally irradiating an immunodeficient mammal, infusing human hematopoietic cells into the mammal and administering an effective amount of human mast cell growth factor (MGF) and a human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor/interleukin-3 fusion protein (GM-CSF/IL-3 FP) to promote engraftment of human cells within the chimeric mammal's bone marrow.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLEChimeric Mammals with Human Hematopoietic CellsTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a method for engrafting human hematopoietic cells in a non-human mammal by bone marrow transplantation. More particularly, the present invention relates to Chimeric mammals with human hematopoietic cells, including progenitor cells and mature cells of the myeloid, lymphoid and erythroid lineages, a process for engrafting human hematopoietic cells to create a chimeric iriammal, and a process for creating hybridoma cells capable of producing a human monoclonal antibody.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The mammalian hematopoietic system is arranged as a hierarchy consisting of a wide array of cells ranging from large numbers of mature differentiated cells to rare pluripotent stem cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation. Much of our knowledge concerning organization and regulation of mammalian hematopoietic systems is derived from studies with murine hematopoietic systems. Conversely, our understanding of specifics of the human hematopoietic system is much less complete due to a lack of a reliable model for human hematopoiesis. Therefore, there is a need in the art for a human-specific hematopoietic model that includes human stem cells. Various investigators have attempted to transplant human hematopoietic cells into a murine bone marrow microenvironment with varying degrees of success. Xenogeneic bone marrow transplantation is possible between closely related species, such as rat and mouse. However, xenogeneic bone marrow transplantation has not enabled the stable transplant of human hematopoietic cells of multiple lineages into more distantly related mammalian species, such as mice or rats. For example, engraftment of human cells in severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice, permitted infection of mice with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Namikawa et al., . Exp. Med 772:1055(1990). However, detectable human cells were limited to a human T cell lineage and survived for only two to three months. Further, the T cells were detected only in blood and not in any other organ. Thus, transplantation of human hematopoietic cells into SCID mice was limited to the transient survival of only one lineage of human hematopoietic cells. 

 McCune et al., Science 241:1632 (1988) attempted to facilitate engraftment of human hematopoietic cells (from fetal liver) into a SCID mouse by further transplanting a graft of human fetal thymic epithelium under the kidney capsule. Control SCID mice that

 CLAIMS
We claim:
1. A chimeric mammal having a stable bone marrow graft of human hematopoietic ceUs, capable of differentiating into multiple lineages of mature human cells, wherein at least 30% of the hematopoietic ceUs in bone marrow are of human origin.
2. The chimeric mammal of claim 1, wherein the graft consists essentially of human hematopoietic progenitor cells, multipotent human progenitor cells, and mature human hematopoietic ceUs of the lymphoid, myeloid and erythroid lineages.
3. The chimeric mammal of claim 1 wherein the mammal is a mouse.
