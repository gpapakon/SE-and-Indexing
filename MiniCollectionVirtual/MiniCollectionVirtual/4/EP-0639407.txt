<ABSTRACT>
A check valve (10) having a reduced or zero pressure drop 
and more particularly such a valve in combination with 

a spray nozzle (40). The check valve (10) includes a sealed gas 
chamber (32) which has within it a closed-cell foam (26) element 

which insures that some gas remains in the chamber 
even if the primary seal fails. The new valve/nozzle (10,40) 

combination allows valve operating pressure to be set 
very close to nozzle operation pressure which allows 

the nozzle to achieve full spray more quickly at 
start-up and a more immediate cessation of flow at 

shut off.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a check
valve
according to the preamble of claim 1. A check valve of this kind
is known from the US-A-4 172 465. Specifically, the invention
refers to a check valve having a
substantially reduced or eliminated pressure drop.In prior spraying applications, when nozzles have been
used without a check valve, the result at start up has
been that fluid at first drips or dribbles from the
nozzle, and then flows in an increasing stream which
develops into a spray as full pump pressure develops.
Only then is the desired spray pattern achieved. At
shut down, a similar sequence occurs except in reverse
order. Thus, when the pump stops the spray pattern
deteriorates into a small fluid stream which issues
from the nozzle for a short period and that stream
reverts to a dribble as the pressure approaches zero.
The presence of such streams or dribbles is, at the
very least, wasteful of the fluid intended to be
sprayed and often objectionable or even dangerous.
For example, in the operation of oil burners, when 
fuel enters the combustion chamber in anything other
than the desired spray pattern, the fuel is difficult
to ignite, incomplete combustion occurs after
ignition, undesired combustion products are produced
and fuel is wasted. Another example is in
agricultural spraying operations where insecticides,
herbicides, disinfectants and other chemicals are used
for a variety of purposes. Here, in addition to
wastefulness, other potential problems include skin or
foliage burns, eye irritation or injury and dangerous
accumulation of chemicals on surfaces.More recently, a variety of efforts have been made to
improve these start up and shut down shortcomings by
the use of check valves in combination with spray
nozzles. In a typical prior check valve significant
pressure drop occurs as a valve opens because applied
pressure on the back of the movable valve member
partially cancels supply pressure on the front. There
are several potential problems caused by the pressure
drop through such a typical check valve. It is
necessary to increase system pressure to compensate
for reduced flow due to the pressure required to hold
the valve open. Failure of a typical check valve
could result in a higher than specified pressure and 
flow condition. Removal of a check valve from a
system without a system pressure adjustment could also
result in a higher than specified pressure and flow
condition. The operating or opening pressure of the
typical check valve in a nozzle is usually
significantly lower than

<CLAIMS>
Check valve comprising:

a valve body (12) having a piston receiving recess (14) and
at least one inlet port (50) extending through an otherwise

closed end of said body (12),
a piston (16) located in said piston receiving recess (14),
said piston (16) having a face at one end and a recess in its

opposite end,
said valve body (12) having a flow path (54, 56) when said
valve is in an open configuration to permit fluid flow to

enter said valve through said at least one inlet port (50),
to pass between said piston receiving recess (14) and said

piston (16) and then to exit the valve through at least one
outlet port (56),
characterized by
a valve cone (20) retained in said piston receiving recess
(14) axially outwardly of said piston recess,
a first seal member (36) positioned between said face of said
piston (16) and said end of said valve body (12) to form a

seal around said at least one inlet port (50) when said valve
is in a closed configuration,
a second seal member (30) positioned between a wall (24) of
said piston recess and a surface of said valve cone (20) thus

creating a sealed gas chamber (32), and 
piston moving means (18) positioned between said piston (16)

and said valve cone (20), said means (18) adapted to move
said piston (16) to its closed position when fluid ceases to

enter said at least one inlet port (50).
The check valve of claim 1 in which said sealed gas chamber
(32) has within it an element (26) having at least one gas-filled

closed cell.
The check valve of claim 2 in which said element comprises
a body (26) having a plurality of gas-filled closed cells.
The check valve of claim 3 in which said body (26) comprises
foam.
The check valve of claim 1 in which said piston moving means
(18) comprises a spring (18).
The check valve of claim 1 in which said at least one outlet
port (56) passes through said valve cone (20).
The check valve of claim 1 in which said at least one outlet
port (56) passes through said valve body (12).
The check valve of claim 1 in which said sealed gas chamber
(32) has within it an element (26) comprising a body (26)

having at least one gas-filled closed cell.
Nozzle and valve assembly comprising a check valve according
to one of the preceding claims.
