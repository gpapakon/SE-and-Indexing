<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a cutting mechanism for so-called document shredders, the stripping sheets (E1 and E2) are arranged on the upper and lower sides of the individual cutting rollers (1, 2 with 3, 4) either singly (E1, E2) or combined to form groups (GR1 and/or GR2) of any number at intervals (LÃœ) with respect to one another.

<CLAIMS>
Cutting mechanism for document shredders, with a cutting roller pair (1,2 with 3,4)
and stripper plates (E
1
 and E
2
), which are associated therewith in pairs per roller, extend
up to the roller core (3, 4) between the cutter discs (1, 2), are held between the lateral

cutting mechanism bearing plates by way of rods (HST
1
 and HST
2
) extending through and
lie on the cutting mechanism upper side and lower side in alternation at gaps,

characterised in that the stripper plates (E
1
 and E
2
) on the cutting mechanism upper side
and lower side are each time combined individually, or as groups (GR
1
 or GR
2
), into two or
more stripper plates (E
1
 or E
2
) and the gap spacings (A
1
 or A
2
) between a group (GR
1
 or
GR
2
) or an individual stripper plate (E
1
 or E
2
) and an adjacent group (GR
1
 or GR
2
) or an
adjacent individual stripper plate (E
1
 or E
2
) are kept different in size.
Cutting mechanism according to claim 1, characterised in that the foot parts of the
stripper plates (E
1
) are guided on the cutting mechanism upper side up to about the cutting
stock intake gap (ESP) of the cover hood and there open flushly into longitudinally

extending finger protection rods (ST).
