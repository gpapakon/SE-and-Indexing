<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a rasp (2) corresponding to the implant shaft, which comprises a shaft body (4) which can be forced into the osseous tissue, and a neck portion (5) which projects away from the shaft body and can be fitted with a trial ball (6) corresponding to the joint ball, as well as a handle (7) which can be coupled to the rasp (2) for forcing-in and retracting the shaft body (4). The handle (7) comprises a guide sleeve (10) attachable to the neck portion (5) and an attachment portion (14) with a stop surface that can be attached to a front support surface of the neck portion (5). A coupling member (11) is articulated on the handle (7). The coupling member has a claw (27) which can be engaged through a recess in the guide sleeve (10) into a recess in the neck portion (5) and out of the latter. In this device, which can be produced from simple components which are easily kept sterile, all the stop, guide and tensioning surfaces which are effective when the shaft body (4) is forced in or retracted, are located within the enveloping surface area of the neck portion (5), so that they are protected against contact with liquid or bone particles.

A device for the preparation of a tubular bone for the
insertion of an implant shaft to be equipped with an

artificial ball-and-socket joint, in particular a femur
shaft of a hip joint prosthesis, having a rasp (2)

corresponding to the implant shaft with respect to shape
and size, which comprises a shaft body (4) which can be

driven into and withdrawn from the bone (1) in the
direction of its longitudinal axis (L), and a neck part

(5) protruding therefrom which can be provided with a
test ball (6), corresponding to the ball-and-socket

joint, and a handle (7) which can be placed on the rasp
(2) and which contains a bush (10) having a bore (13) to

contain the neck part (5) and a locking mechanism which
can be detachably connected to the neck part (5), with

the neck part (5) being designed with a front support
face (16) for a stop face (15) which is constructed at

the handle (7) and can be placed on said support face
(16) to drive in the rasp (2) and the locking mechanism

containing a coupling part (11) which is adjustably
mounted on the handle (7), can be brought into engagement

with the neck part (5) and can be moved away from it,

characterised in that
 the bush (10) is constructed as a
guide bush which can be placed on the neck part (5) of

the rasp (2) and the coupling part (11) is designed in
the form of a detent pawl swivel-mounted on the handle

(7), which contains a claw (27) adjustable between a
locking position inside a recess (30) constructed on the

neck part (5) of the rasp (2) and a disengaged position
outside said recess.
A device according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 the neck part (5) is designed with
a conical guide portion (5b) intended to interact with a 

conical bore of test ball (6) and tapering in relation to
a centring axis (Z),
in that
 a cylindrical guide portion (5a), which can be
inserted into the guide bush (10), is also constructed on

the neck part (5),
in that
 the bore (13) of guide bush (10) contains a
cylindrical guide face (13a) corresponding to the

cylindrical guide portion (5a),
and in that
 when the handle is placed on the support face
(16) of the neck part (5), the neck part (5) is guided in

the bore (13) of the guide bush (10) with a clearance
which guarantees a centring of the guide bush (10) on the

neck part (5) and at the same time permits a detachment
of the conical guide portion (5b) without self-locking.
A device according to Claim 2,

characterised in that
 the bore (13) of the guide bush
(10) is designed with a conical guide face (13b)

corresponding to the conical guide portion (5b) of the
neck part (5).
A device according to Claim 2,

characterised in that
 the cylindrical guide face (13a) of
the bore (13) extends over a longitudinal portion of the

guide bush (10) housing the conical guide portion (5b) of
the neck part (5).
A device according to Claim 4,

characterised in that
 the neck part (5) is designed with
a second conical guide portion (5c),
and in that
 the bore (13) of the guide bush (10) is
designed with a correspondingly conical guide face (13c)
.
A device according to one of Claims 2 to 5,

characterised in that
 the neck part (5) is designed with
a cylindrical end portion (5d), 
and in that
 the bore (13) is designed with a
corresponding second cylindrical guide face (13d).
A device according to one of the preceding Claims,

characterised in that
 the stop face (15) of the handle
(7) is constructed at slip-on part (14) covering at least

a part of the cross section of the bore (13) of the guide
bush (10),
and in that
 the neck part (5) comprises at least one
guide face (18) placed transversally to its support face

(16) and extending in the direction of the centring axis
(Z) of the neck part (5), for a counter-face (20)

constructed at the slip-on part (14).
A device according to Claim 7,

characterised in that
 the support face (16) of the neck
part (5) is constructed at a set-back portion of the

front face (17),
in that
 the guide face (18) is constructed at a shoulder
of the neck part (5) limiting the support face (16),
and in that
 the counter-face (20) is constructed on a
corresponding shoulder of the slip-on part (14).
A device according to Claim 7 or 8,

characterised in that
 the guide face (18) is constructed
on a flank of a groove-like cavity (37) constructed in

the support face (16) of the neck part (5),
and in that
 the counter-face (20) is constructed on a
guide part which protrudes from the slip-on part (14)

and can be inserted into this cavity (37).
A device according to one of the preceding Claims,

characterised in that
 the detent pawl is provided
with a spring element (34), which under initial

stress can abut a stop (35) constructed at the
handle (7), and can be braced via this against the

locking position.
A device according to Claim 10,

characterised in that
 the detent pawl and the spring
element (34) are constructed at a single-piece

component.
A device according to one of the preceding Claims,

characterised in that
 the detent pawl is disposed in
the region of a recess (26) constructed in the guide

bush (10).
A device according to one of the preceding Claims,

characterised in that
 the claw (27) of the detent
pawl is designed with a flank (28) turned towards

the stop face (15) of the handle (7), which flank is
intended to cooperate with a corresponding counter-flank

(31) constructed at the recess (30) of the
neck part (5) of the rasp (2) and faced towards to

the shaft body (4).
A device according to Claim 13,

characterised in that
 the flank (28) of the claw
(27) and the counter-flank (31) of the recess (30)

of the neck part (5) are each constructed in the
form of an undercut cylindrical face, which is

designed with a radius of curvature (R) which
corresponds to the distance of the flank (28) from
