<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing multi-layered molded pieces having good superficial appearance comprising the steps 
of supplying a skin material into a pair of male and female molds that have not yet been closed, then supplying fused 

thermoplastic resin into said molds through a resin passage provided in said molds, clamping said both molds so 
as to shape said fused thermoplastic resin, and attaching said skin material onto the surface of a thermoplastic resin 

core material formed by being pressurized and cooled, wherein pressurizing and cooling is performed such that the 
temperature at which said fused thermoplastic resin is supplied into said molds is in the range of 175 to 195 °C, the 

pressurizing surface pressure when shaping is completed 30 to 95 kg/cm², and a product of the pressurizing surface 
pressure and pressurizing time in the range of 100 to 1500 kg/cm².sec. after completion of shaping.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing
a multilayer molded article consisting of a skin
material and a thermoplastic resin core material which is
used in interior automotive trims, domestic appliances
and the like.Multilayer molded articles consisting of a skin
material and a thermoplastic core material layer have
been used in large amounts in all fields including
interior automotive trims and domestic appliances because
of their economics, lightweight properties and good
shapeability.Such multilayer molded articles have been
produced, as disclosed in, for example,
JP-A-1-235,613, by a method which
comprises feeding a molten thermoplastic resin to between
a pair of female and male molds to which a skin material
has been fed, clamping both the molds to shape the molten
resin in the interior of the molds, simultaneously
laminating the skin material to the surface of the resin
and thereafter cooling and solidifying the molten resin.However, in the heretofore known methods, in
some cases, deformation is caused in the multilayer 
molded article obtained and the feeling is impaired, and
this has greatly affected the productivity.EP-A-0 466 180 relates to a method for making a multilayer
molded article in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, the
article comprises a body of a thermoplastic resin and a skin
material which is laminated on a surface of said body and
comprises an olefin thermoplastic elastomer having a specific
melt viscosity.Under such circumstances, the present inventors
have made extensive research to produce a multilayer
molded article retaining its good surface appearance, and
have consequently found that the above object can be
achieved by controlling the temperature for feeding the
molten thermoplastic resin to the cavity of the molds,
the clamping pressure and the pressing time
according to claim 1. A preferred embodiment is disclosed in claim 2.Fig. 1 is a sketch drawing of the production
process of this invention and shows the state that a skin
material 6 is placed between a female mold 1 and a male
mold 2 which are not closed.Fig. 2 is a sketch drawing of the production
process of this invention and shows the state that a
molten thermoplastic resin 5 is fed from a resin feed
opening to between the skin material 6 and the cavity
surface of the male mold 2 through a resin passageway 7.Fig. 3 is a sketch drawing of the production
process of this invention and shows the state of cooling
under pressure at completion of the shaping after the
feeding of the molten thermoplastic
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a multilayer molded
article in which a skin material (6) is laminated to the

surface of a thermoplastic polypropylene resin (5) which comprises feeding
the skin material (6) to the cavity of a pair of female (1) and

male (2) molds which are not closed, subsequently feeding a
molten polypropylene thermoplastic resin (5) to the cavity of the molds

through a resin passageway (7) provided in the male or female mold, clamping
both molds to shape the molten polypropylene resin in the cavity of

the molds and then cooling the resin under pressure,
characterized in that the cooling under pressure is

conducted so that a temperature for feeding the molten
thermoplastic resin (5) to the cavity of the molds is in a

range of from 175 to 195°C, a clamping pressure at
completion of the shaping is in a range of from 30 to 95

kg/cm
