<ABSTRACT>
In an absorbent article, such as a diaper or incontinence briefs, an elastic member (60) comprising a net-like elastic substrate (62) to which fibers (64, 66) are pre-bonded provides for a breathable elastic for use as a side- a waist- or leg elastic. The fibers that are bonded to the net-like substrate, for instance by hydro-entangling, ensure a soft and comfortable contact with the wearer's skin. In the side panels of the absorbent article, the elastic members have a large freedom of stretch without buckling taking place, thus reducing chances of leakage. When the elastic member is located between the topsheet and the backsheet, a strong connection of topsheet to backsheet is established using a relatively small amount of adhesive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an absorbent article comprising the features of the
preamble of claim 1.US-A-4 450 026 discloses an absorbent article having a reticulated elastic member
positioned between the facing and the backing. EP-A-0 315 507 discloses an elastic nonwoven fabric made of staple textile fibers
or wood pulp hydroentangled with an elastic web or net.US-A-4 606 964 discloses a bulked web comprising a differentially tensioned
reticulated web of elastic material bonded to at least one gatherable web.In American patent US-A-4,407,284, which discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1, a net-like elastic member is disclosed having longitudinal strands that
are intermittently mutually connected by a number of transverse strands. The elastic
member is placed between the backsheet and the topsheet of an absorbent article, in
particular a diaper. The elastic substrate is placed in parallel with and in the proximity of
the longitudinal sides to provide an elastic leg cuff, or in parallel with and in the proximity
of the lateral sides to provide an elastic waist feature. The elastic member is placed
between the topsheet and the backsheet in its stretched condition, the topsheet being
laminated to the backsheet through the open areas in the elastic member. Upon relaxation
of the elastic member, the topsheet and the backsheet are gathered only for those parts of
the elastic member that are transversely connected. The modulus of elasticity at 100%
elongation of the elastic member, that can be made of any stretchable film material of a
preferred thickness of between 0.13 mm and 0.50 mm, preferably lies between 1.4 and 140
Kgcm-2.An absorbent article of the above mentioned kind, can at the areas where the elastic
member is placed between the topsheet and the backsheet, be relatively uncomfortable to
the skin because the glue, fixing the topsheet to the backsheet, can reduce softness or the
fibrous nature of the topsheet. Furthermore, the direction of stretch is confined to the
longitudinal direction of the elastic member, the bonding of the topsheet to the backsheet
allowing no stretch perpendicular thereto. It is an object of the invention to provide for an absorbent article comprising an
elastic member having good fluid-handling properties and being comfortable during use.It is another object of the invention to provide for an absorbent article comprising an
elastic member giving an improved fit of the absorbent article during use.It is another object of the invention to provide for an elastic member

lateral sides (22, 24) extending transversely to the longitudinal sides, and
an elastic member (18, 21, 23, 60, 67) connected to the backsheet (16), the elastic
member comprising a net-like structure (62) of interconnected elastic strands (71, 72) and

a layer of fibers (64, 66) on either side of said net-like substrate, a layer of fibers being

the fibers on one side of the substrate (62) are oriented transversely to the fibers (66) on
the other side of the substrate.
Absorbent article according to claim 1 characterized in that the elastic member (18, 21,
23, 60, 67) is positioned between the topsheet (12) and the backsheet (16)
Absorbent article according to any of the previous claims, the absorbent article
comprising two side panels (55) located at respective end-parts of the longitudinal

sides(22, 24) and extending transversely thereto, characterized in that at least one side
panel (55)comprises an elastic member (21, 23).
Absorbent article according to any of the previous claims, characterized in that an elastic
member (65) is provided along each longitudinal side (26, 28) as a leg elastic.
Absorbent article according to any of the previous claims, characterized in that an elastic
member (67) is placed along at least one of the lateral sides as a waist elastic. 
Absorbent article according to any of the previous claims, characterized in that the
backsheet (16) is mechanically treated in the areas that are coextensive with the elastic

member (18, 21, 23, 60, 67) so that the backsheet is permanently elongated in those areas.
Absorbent article according to any of the previous claims characterized in that the elastic
member (18, 21, 23, 60, 67) is attached to the backsheet (16) in a pre-stretched state, the

elastic member upon relaxation gathering the backsheet.
Absorbent article according to any of the previous claims, characterized in that the netlike
substrate (62) comprises a first and a second set of strands (71, 72) which are mutually

transversely connected, the first set of strands having an elasticity which differs from the
elasticity of the second set of strands.
