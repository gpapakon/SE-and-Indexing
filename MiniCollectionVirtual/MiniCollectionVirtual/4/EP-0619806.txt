<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation of United States 
Patent Application 07/800,667 filed November 27, 1991. This invention relates to novel processes for the 
preparation and resolution of substituted piperidines and 
related compounds, as well as to novel intermediates used in 
such processes. The substituted piperidines and related compounds that 
can be prepared by the processes of this invention are 
substance P receptor antagonists and are therefore useful in 
treating diseases mediated by an excess of substance P. Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide 
belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter 
being named for their prompt stimulatory action on smooth 
muscle tissue. More specifically, substance P is a pharmacologically-active 
neuropeptide that is produced in mammals 
(having originally been isolated from gut) and possesses a 
characteristic amino acid sequence that is illustrated by 
D.F. Veber et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,680,283. The wide 
involvement of substance P and other tachykinins in the 
pathophysiology of numerous diseases has been amply 
demonstrated in the art. For instance, substance P has been 
shown to be involved in the transmission of pain or migraine 
[see B.E.B. Sandberg et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 
Vol. 25, p. 1009 (1982)], as well as in central nervous 
system disorders such as anxiety and schizophrenia, in 
respiratory and inflammatory diseases such as asthma and 
rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, in rheumatic diseases 
such as fibrositis, and in gastrointestinal disorders and 
diseases of the GI tract, such as ulcerative colitis and 
Crohn's disease, etc. (see D. Regoli in "Trends in Cluster 
Headache," Edited by F. Sicuteri et al., Elsevier Scientific 
Publishers, Amsterdam, 1987, pp. 85-95). The substituted piperidines and related compounds that  
 
can be prepared by the methods of this invention are claimed 
in PCT Patent Application PCT/US 90/00116, filed January 4, 
1990, and assigned in common with the present application. The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing compounds of the formula 
 
wherein R¹ is aryl selected from indanyl, phenyl and 
naphthyl; heteroaryl selected from thienyl, furyl, pyridyl 
and quinolyl; and cycloalkyl having 3-7 carbon atoms, 
wherein one of said carbon atoms may optionally be replaced 
by nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur; wherein each of said aryl and 
heteroaryl groups may optionally be substituted with one or 
more substituents, and said (C₃-C₇) cycloalkyl may optionally 
be
