<ABSTRACT>
An intracardiac electrical potential reference catheter (10) includes a proximal shaft section (14) in a distal flexible tip section (12). The flexible tip section shaped in a geometry suitable for performing intracardiac mapping and includes a plurality of electrodes (24, 26, 28, 30, 34) axially spaced-apart thereon. The shaft section is formed from a polymeric material (41) and includes a reinforcement layer, typically a stainless steel braid (44). The flexible tip section is also formed from a polymeric material (31) and is free from any braided reinforcement. A core wire (70) is attached to a proximal housing (22) on the catheter at one end and to a distal electrode tip (34) at the other end. In this way, the torque is transmitted along the length of the catheter by both the reinforced shaft and separately by the core wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field 
of electrophysiology. More particularly, this invention 
relates to methods and apparatus for mapping cardiac 
arrhythmias. Symptoms of abnormal heart rhythm are generally 
referred to as cardiac arrhythmias, with an abnormally slow 
rhythm being classified as bradycardia and an abnormally rapid 
rhythm being referred to as tachycardia. The present 
invention is concerned with the treatment of tachycardias 
which are frequently caused by the presence of an 
"arrhythmogenic site" or "accessory atrioventricular pathway" 
close to the inner surface of one of the chambers of the 
heart. The heart includes a number of normal pathways which 
are responsible for the propagation of signals necessary for 
normal electrical mechanical function. The presence of 
arrhythmogenic sites or accessory pathways can bypass or short 
circuit the normal pathways, potentially resulting in very 
rapid heart contractions, referred to as tachycardias. 
Tachycardias may be defined as ventricular tachycardias (VT's) 
and supraventricular tachycardias (SVT's). VT's originate in 
the left or right ventricle and are typically caused by 
arrhythmogenic sites associated with a prior myocardial 
infarction. SVT's originate in the atria and are typically 
caused by an accessory pathway. Treatment of both ventricular and supraventricular 
tachycardias may be accomplished by a variety of approaches, 
including drugs, surgery, implantable pacemakers/defibrillators, 
and catheter ablation. While drugs may be the 
treatment of choice for many patients, they only mask the 
symptoms and do not cure the underlying cause. Implantable 
devices only correct the arrhythmia after it occurs. Surgical  
 
and catheter-based treatments, in contrast, will actually cure 
the problem, usually by ablating the abnormal arrhythmogenic 
tissue or accessory pathway responsible for the tachycardia. 
The catheter-based treatments rely on the application of 
various destructive energy sources to the target tissue, 
including direct current electrical energy, radiofrequency 
electrical energy, laser energy, and the like. Regardless of the particular catheter-based 
treatment selected, it will generally be necessary to 
initially map the interior surfaces of the heart to locate the 
arrhythmogenic site(s) and accessory pathway(s). Such mapping 
involves the measurement of electrical potentials at different 
locations within the heart to detect abnormalities using a 
procedure generally referred to as "programmed
