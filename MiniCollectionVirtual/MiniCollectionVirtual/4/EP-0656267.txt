<ABSTRACT>
The rolling-contact bearing comprises a rotating race and a non-rotating race through each of which pass ducts (6, 7) for the passage of fluid, rolling bodies (3) between the rotating and non-rotating races, and a seal device (8) mounted between the rotating and non-rotating races in order to form a sealed intermediate chamber (14) communicating with the fluid passage ducts (6, 7). The intermediate chamber has two flexible walls (11), the free end parts of which form two sealing lips (12) in rubbing contact with a bearing surface (13) of one of the races (2) of the bearing. The bearing surfaces (13) with rubbing contact are inclined with respect to the axis (XX') of rotation of the bearing. The flexible walls (11) extend substantially parallel to the said bearing surfaces so that the contact pressure between the sealing lips and the bearing surfaces varies in the same direction as the pressure of the fluid in the intermediate chamber (14) of the seal device.

Rolling-contact bearing comprising a rotating
race and a non-rotating race, through each one of which

there pass channels (6, 7) for the passage of fluid,
rolling bodies (3) between the rotating race and the non-rotating

race, and a sealing device (8) mounted between
the rotating race and the non-rotating race to form a

sealed intermediate chamber (14) communicating with the
channels (6, 7) for the passage of fluid, the intermediate

chamber having two flexible walls (11), the free
end parts of which form two sealing lips (12) in rubbing

contact with a bearing surface (13) of one of the races
(2) of the bearing, characterized in that the bearing

surfaces (13) for rubbing contact are inclined with
respect to the axis (XX') of rotation of the bearing, and

that the flexible walls (11) extend more or less parallel
to the said bearing surfaces in such a way that the

contact pressure between the sealing lips and the bearing
surfaces varies in the same direction as the pressure of

the fluid in the intermediate chamber (14) of the sealing
device.
Rolling-contact bearing according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the channels for the passage of

fluid in the rotating race and the non-rotating race are
situated more or less in one and the same radial plane

which also constitutes the plane of symmetry for the
sealing device.
Rolling-contact bearing according to Claim 1 or
2, characterized in that the angle of inclination of the

bearing surfaces (13) for rubbing contact is between 10°
and 90°.
Rolling-contact bearing according to Claim 1, 2
or 3, characterized in that the bearing surfaces for

rubbing contact (13) are formed by generatrices which are
sections of a straight line.
Rolling-contact bearing according to Claim 1, 2
or 3, characterized in that the bearing surfaces for

rubbing contact (13) are formed by generatrices which are 
sections of a curve.
Rolling-contact bearing according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the bearing

surfaces for rubbing contact (13) are obtained by
directly machining the corresponding race (2) of the

bearing.
Rolling-contact bearing according to one of
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the bearing surfaces

for rubbing contact (13) are attached to the corresponding
race (2) by means of a metal support (20) push-fitted

onto the said race.
Rolling-contact bearing according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that it has an annular

shape so that it defines between the rotating race and
the non-rotating race of the bearing a fluid-tight

intermediate chamber (14), two flexible lateral walls
(11) of which are inclined with respect to the axis of

rotation (XX') of the bearing, the free end of the said
flexible walls constituting the sealing lips (12) in

rubbing contact with the bearing surfaces (13) of the
bearing.
Sealing device according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized
in that it has two secondary sealing lips (15) in

rubbing contact with a cylindrical bearing surface
adjacent to the bearing surfaces (13) for rubbing contact

in order to protect the sealing lips (12) from the grease
used to lubricate the rolling bodies (3) of the bearing.
Sealing device according to one of Claims 7 to 9,

characterized in that it consists of two separate seals
(9) mounted axially facing one another.
Sealing device according to one of Claims 7 to
10, characterized in that it is integral with a central

body (16) has two sealing lips (12) which delimit the
intermediate chamber (14), the central body having

passing through it a number of radial channels (19) which
communicate on the one hand with the channels (6) in the

race (1) for securing the device and on the other hand
with the intermediate chamber.
