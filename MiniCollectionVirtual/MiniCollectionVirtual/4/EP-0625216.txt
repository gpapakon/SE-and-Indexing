<ABSTRACT>
Lead-contaminated soil and battery casings are remediated using a plasma arc furnace (18) which pyrolyzes the soil and waste battery casings so as to form a vitrified slag and a combustible gas, respectively. The combustible gas along with volatilized lead (and other heavy metals which may be present) are transferred to, and used as a primary fuel by, a conventional smelting furnace (30). The volatilized lead that is entrained in the combustible gas is thus transferred to the recovery and environmental protection/control equipment (32, 34, 36) associated with the smelting furnace. The soil, on the other hand, is converted into a non-toxic (i.e., according to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure) vitrified slag by the plasma arc which may be crushed and used as a commercial material (e.g., roadway aggregate, asphalt filler material and the like) or simply transferred to a landfill where it poses no environmental threat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a process for the 
remediation of lead-contaminated soil and waste battery casings. 
More specifically, this invention relates to a novel process whereby a 
mixture of lead-contaminated soil and battery casings may be 
pyrolyzed in a plasma arc furnace so as to volatilize the battery 
casings to form a combustible CO gas that is then supplied as a 
primary fuel to a conventional smelting furnace. A major proportion of 
the lead contaminant is likewise volatilized and transferred along with 
the combustible gas to the smelting furnace where it can then be 
subjected to conventional lead-recovery techniques. The soil, on the 
other hand, forms a vitrified slag in the plasma arc furnace and 
thereby serves as a non-toxic and non-leachable host matrix for any 
minor proportion of lead that is not volatilized. The safe treatment and disposal of all waste materials is 
demanded in most developed nations. In this regard, there is a 
growing demand on industry by environmentalists and government 
agencies to alleviate potentially toxic and/or contaminated waste 
disposal sites that were employed for many years prior to the public's 
heightened environmental concerns and the enactment of  
 
environmental legislation. For example, a number of now defunct lead-acid battery 
recycling sites were operated where lead was reclaimed from spent 
lead-acid batteries. At most such lead-acid battery recycling sites, the 
primary operation consisted of breaking the battery case, draining the 
spent acid, and separating the battery cases from the commercially 
valuable lead to be recycled. The broken battery cases, which were at 
that time formed of a non-recyclable, hardened rubber material known 
in art parlance as "ebonite", were of no commercial value and were 
thus typically discarded as landfill waste. However, it is now known 
that these discarded battery cases in landfills nonetheless were 
contaminated with sufficient quantities of lead that could detrimentally 
affect the environment. Various techniques have been proposed for the remediation of 
landfills containing lead-contaminated waste lead-acid battery casings. 
For example, The U.S. Bureau of Mines has proposed a chemical 
reclamation process for waste lead-acid battery casings whereby 
battery casing particles are carbonized by treatment in a sodium or 
ammonium carbonate solution followed by acid washing with nitric 
acetic or flurosilicic acids. See, "The Hazardous Waste Consultant", 
September/October 1991,

A method for the remediation of lead-contaminated soil and 
waste material comprising the steps of: 


(a) feeding a mixture of lead-contaminated soil and waste 
material into a plasma arc furnace (18); 
(b) pyrolyzing the mixture in the plasma arc furnace for a 
time sufficient to convert the waste material into a combustible gas and 

to vitrify the soil; 
(c) combusting the combustible gas in a combustion 
apparatus ;
 
   characterised in that the waste material is lead-acid battery 

casings, whereby the combustible gas from step (b) entrains a major 
amount of lead contaminants as a vapor, and the combustion apparatus 

is a lead smelting furnace (30); and 
(d) the combustible gas and vaporized lead contaminant 
entrained therewithin from the plasma arc furnace (18) are transferred 

to the lead smelting furnace (30) and the entrained lead is recovered 
therein. 
A method as in claim 1, which further comprises the steps of: 

providing a supply of natural gas to said smelting furnace (30); 
and 
controlling the flow of natural gas in dependence upon the flow of 
said combustible gas transferred from said plasma arc furnace (18). 
A method as in claim 2, wherein said step of controlling the flow 
of natural gas includes sensing a combustion temperature within the 

smelting furnace (30) and adjusting the flow rate of the natural gas in 
response to said sensed temperature.

feeding a flux material together with the mixture of lead-contaminated 

soil and waste lead-acid battery casings into the plasma arc furnace
