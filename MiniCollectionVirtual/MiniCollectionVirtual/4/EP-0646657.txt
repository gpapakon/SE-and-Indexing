<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ferritic stainless
steels having an excellent oxidation resistance, and
more particularly to Fe-Cr-Al series ferritic stainless
steel usable as a material in combustion cylinder for
stove, exhaust gas purifying device for automobile,
electric heating body and the like and having improved
oxidation resistance, toughness and hot workability.In general, it is known that the ferritic
stainless steel is a material suitable for applications
requiring the oxidation resistance such as the exhaust
gas purifying device for automobile, combustion cylinder
for the stove and the like. In the recent exhaust gas
purifying device for automobile, however, the thickness
of the plate used in the device is thinned to reduce the
resistance to the exhaust gas flowing and mitigate the
loading on the engine. And also, the thickness of the
combustion cylinder in the stove is thinned in order to
enhance the combustion efficiency, whereby the
temperature is increased and the cost is reduced. In 
any case, the thickness reduction is attempted by these
means, so that the service life of the stainless steel
is considerably degraded.For this end, ferritic stainless steels having
a greater amount of Al have mainly be proposed, but as
the amount of Al in the stainless steel increases, the
brittleness of hot rolled steel sheet is promoted to
increase the degree of cracking or breaking of the sheet
passing in the sheet production and further it is
impossible to conduct the production in the usual
producing apparatus.As a technique for overcoming the above
problem of the high Al-content ferritic stainless steel,
there is proposed a method as disclosed in JP-B-2-58340.
In this technique, rare earth elements of Ce, La, Pr,
Nd and the like are added in a total amount of up to
0.060 wt%, but if it is intended to manufacture products
having particularly a thin thickness, there is caused
another problem that the working can not be carried out
at a usual hot working temperature.There is proposed another method as described
in JP-B-4-8502 (JP-A-63-45351). This method is a
technique developed for overcoming the problem included
in the method of JP-B-2-58340. The feature of this
technique is rolling work having no cracking is made
possible to more improve oxidation resistance by adding
lanthanoides other than Ce being a serious factor. 
However, such a technique is required to separate and
remove Ce from the rare earth elements (hereinafter
abbreviated as "REM"), so that the cost increases and
also there is caused a
