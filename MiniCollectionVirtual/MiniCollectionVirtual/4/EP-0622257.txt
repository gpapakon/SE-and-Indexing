<ABSTRACT>
An orientable air vent for motor vehicles comprising 
an intake (11), a diffuser (12) and a diffusion grille (13) 

which is connected to the intake body (11) with the 
interposition of an annular frame (14) that is pivoted to 

the intake (11) and to the grille (13). The frame (14) acts 
as a ball-and-socket connection element and allows the 

grille to assume an angular position around a point that 
lies on the axis of the intake.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air vent for motor 
vehicles. As is known, air vents include diffusion means that 
direct the flow of air substantially within a frustum-shaped 
space, the smaller cross-section whereof coincides 
with the cross-section of the diffuser. Typically, these orientable diffusion means include a 
first row of vanes and a second row of vanes that can 
rotate about respective mutually perpendicular steering 
axes. According to a predominantly adopted arrangement, the 
vanes of the first row are individually pivoted to a frame 
that rigidly supports the vanes of the second row and is in 
turn pivoted to the body of the diffuser. This typical arrangement of known vents has several 
drawbacks, the main one being a considerable structural 
complication, which negatively affects the manufacturing 
costs and the functionality of the vent. Furthermore, the 
known air vents do not allow the air flow to be directed in 
a fully satisfactory manner, due to the fact that the rows 
of vanes are arranged in axial succession, the second row 
being located downstream of the first row relatively to the 
motion of the air stream. Furthermore, the individual rows of vanes require 
respective and different orientation maneuvers, thus 
complicating the adjustment operation to the detriment of 
easy use. In order to attempt to eliminate these drawbacks, it 
has already been proposed to use a single orientable grille 
with a substantially spherical body that is slideably  
 
rotatable within a corresponding spherical seat of the body 
of the air vent. However, air vents of this type 
manufactured so far have not yielded satisfactory results, 
due to the difficulty in providing and maintaining the 
correct sliding contact between the body of the grille and 
the seat containing it, since this contact is intensely 
affected by wear, which loosens the sliding contact and 
allows unintended movements of the grille, and by the 
presence of dust and foreign matter that easily jam said 
grille. Furthermore, known air vents of this type have a 
complicated structure and entail considerable difficulties 
in assembling their various components. The aim of the present invention is essentially to 
eliminate these drawbacks, and within the scope of this 
general aim the invention has the important objects of 
providing an air vent that is structurally very simple, 
reliable in operation, substantially wear-free and 
insensitive to the presence of dust and/or foreign matter. Another object of the invention is to

Air vent for motor vehicles, comprising an intake 
(11), a diffuser (12) and an orientable diffusion grille 

(13), characterized in that the diffusion grille (13) is 
connected to the intake body (11) with the interposition of 

an annular frame (14) that is pivoted to the intake (11) 
and to the grille (13) and acts as a ball-and-socket 

connection element that allows said grille to assume an 
angular position around a point that lies on the axis of 

the intake. 
Air vent according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the orientable diffusion grille (13) is pivoted to the 

frame (14) at a first diameter (a) thereof and in that the 
frame (14) is in turn pivoted to the intake (11) at a 

second diameter (b) thereof which is at right angles to the 
first one (a). 
Air vent according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the frame (14) is pivoted to the grille (13) and to 

the intake (11) with the interposition of rotational 
devices (17-25) that can brake, by friction coupling, the 

relative angular movements between the grille and the frame 
and between said frame and the intake. 
Air vent according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the orientable diffusion grille (13) 

includes a series of axial delivery channels (30) 
surrounded by a border (33) which is substantially shaped 

like a spherical segment, contains the frame (14) and is 
accommodated, without sliding contact, in a corresponding 

spherical seat (34) of the diffuser (12).  
 
Air vent according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the intake (11) and the diffuser (12) 

are detachably connected by means that include a ring of 
through slots (35) provided on an extension (12a) of the 

diffuser and a plurality of flexible retention teeth (36) 
which are provided on a collar (11a) of the intake (11); 

said teeth and said slots cooperating by snap-together 
engagement. 
Air vent according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the intake (11), the diffuser (12), 

the grille (13) and the frame (14) are made of a 
thermoplastic polymeric material.
