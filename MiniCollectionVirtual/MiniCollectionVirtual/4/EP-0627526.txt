<ABSTRACT>
The approximately vertical side walls (2) of the paving stone (1) are inwardly offset in their lower part (6) with respect to the upper part (7) of the side wall (2). In this way, upon setting the paving stones (1) against one another, a cavity (8) which is open at the bottom results between two adjacent paving stones (1) in the lower part of the side walls (2). The communication of the cavities (8), interconnected in the manner of a drainage system, with the surface of the paving stones laid virtually without gaps is established by a vertical recess (9) in the upper part of the side walls (2) of the paving stones (1). Rapid and reliable drainage of the rainwater into the soil is thereby made possible.

<CLAIMS>
A paving stone for floor coverings comprising nearly vertical sides (2) 
being nearly jointlessly attachable to the appropriate sides (2) of the adjacent 

paving stones (1, 1', 1") in a laid pattern, the lower part (6) of at least one side 
(2) of the paving stone (1, 1', 1") being offset inwardly relative to the upper part 

(7) of the side (2) so that at least two of each adjacent paving stones (1, 1', 1") 
in the lower part (6) of the sides (2) next to each other form a cavity (8) being 

open towards the bottom which is linked via at least one roughly vertical recess 
(9) in the upper part (7) of the side (2) with the surface of the paving stone (1, 

1', 1"), the lower part (6) of the inwardly offset sides (2) of the paving stone (1, 
1', 1") relative to the upper part (7) having supports (10) for supporting the 

paving stone on the ground, which project outwardly relative to the lower part of 
the sides (2), characterised in that the supports (10) are arranged in the region 

of the four corners of the paving stone (1, 1',1"). 
A paving stone as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the support 
(10) is running laterally, extending into the proximity of the lateral boundary of 

the upper part (7) of the side wall (2). 
A paving stone as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
support (10) extends from the bottom (4) of the paving stone (1, 1', 1") upwards 

to the upper part (7) of the side (2). 
A paving stone as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that two each of the supports (10) are provided, which are arranged 

lengthwise to the paving stone (1, 1', 1") with a spacing from each other. 
A paving stone as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the supports (10) are integrated into the geometry of the paving stone (1, 

1', 1") and run approximately parallel to the extemal outline of the paving stone.  
 
A paving stone as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that in the laid pattern of the square paving stones (13) a face (3) of the 

adjacent paving stone abuts a side (2) each of the paving stone and the 
cavities (8) of all paving stones (13) are linked with each other lengthwise and 

crosswise.
