<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a kiln (5a, 5b), particularly but not exclusively, for heat treating clay products such as pipes (85a, 85b) or tiles. Prior art kilns suffer from a number of problems. For example: the length of the kiln makes it impractical for large diameter pipes; limited only to heat treating pipes of a certain diameter; heat exchange is not properly effected between lower and upper zones. The invention, therefore, provides a kiln (5a, 5b) for heat treating pipes (85a, 85b) comprising a drying/preheat zone (10a, 10b), a firing zone (25a, 25b) and a cooling zone (40a, 40b), and conveyor means for transporting one or more support means (80a, 95a, 80b, 95b) each supporting one or more pipes (85a, 85b) through at least one of such zones, in use each pipe (85a, 85b) being supported upon the respective support means (80a, 95a, 80b, 95b) substantially perpendicularly to the direction of transportation, each support means (80a, 95a, 80b, 95b) further having means for rotating (100a, 100b) each pipe (85a, 85b) supported therein along a longitudinal direction of the respective pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
 THERMAL PROCESS WHEREIN THE CHARGE IS ROTATED ALONG INTO A L NGITUDINAL AXISBackground to the Invention5 This invention relates to thermal processes , to kilns , and more particularly but not exclusively to kilns for heat treating clay products such as pipes or tiles.There is disclosed in GB 2 021 743 (Hepworth) a kiln in which pipes are rotated in a hot zone to maintain10 roundness and ensure uniform heating. There is disclosed in US 4 628 615 (Verheyden) a kiln having upper and lower levels in which a chain moves pipes of same diameter rotatably along a path including both levels.The arrangements disclosed in the above patent15 specifications suffer from a number of problems. For example, the kiln disclosed in GB 1 021 743 is very long, and therefore impractical for large diameter pipes. The kiln- disclosed in US 4 628 615 suffers from the problem that it is only suitable for heat treating pipes of a20 certain diameter. Also, US 4 628 615 has the problem that the temperature of the vitrification zone is cycled between maximum and minimum temperatures, and that heat exchange is not properly effected between lower and upper zones.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention25 to obviate or mitigate at least some of the aforementioned disadvantages.Summary of the Invention30 A first aspect of the present invention provides a kiln for heat treating pipes comprising a drying/preheat zone, a firing zone and 'a cooling zone, and conveyor meansX for transporting one or more support means each supporting one or more pipes through at"'least one of such zones. In fÂ» 35 use each pipe is supported upon the "respective support means substantially perpendicularly to the direction of transportation, each support means further having means for 

rotating each pipe supported thereon along a longitudinal direction of the respective pipe.The support means in at least one zone may comprise a wheeled trolley. The support means in at least one zone may comprise a walking frame or beam.Advantageously, adjacent zones are spaced apart from one another by a transfer zone having means for transferring pipes from a support means used in one zone to a support means used in a next zone.Support means for use in the drying/preheat zone and in the cooling zone may be made from mild steel, the means for rotating each pipe possibly being made from stainless steel. Support means for use in the firing zone may be made from mild steel, the means for rotating each pipe possibly being made from silicon carbide.The support means for

Claims
1. A kiln for heat treating pipes comprising a drying/preheat zone, a firing zone and a cooling zone, and conveyor means for transporting one or more support means each supporting one or more pipes through at least one of such zones, in use each pipe being supported upon the respective support means substantially perpendicularly to the direction of transportation, each support means further having means for rotating each pipe supported thereon along a longitudinal direction of the respective pipe.
2. A kiln as claimed in claim 1, wherein the support means in at least one zone comprises a wheeled trolley.
3. A kiln as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2, wherein the support means in at least one zone 
""
comprises a walking beam.
4. A kiln as claimed in any preceeding claim, wherein adjacent zones are spaced apart from one another by a transfer zone having means for transferring pipes from a support means used in one zone to a support means used in a next zone.
5. A kiln as claimed in any preceeding claim, wherein support means for use in the drying/preheat zone and in the cooling zone are made from mild steel, the means for rotating each pipe being made from stainless steel.
6. A kiln as claimed in any preceeding claim, wherein support means for use in the firing zone are made from mild steel, the means for rotating each pipe being made from silicon carbide.
7. A kiln as claimed in any preceeding claim, wherein the support means for use in the firing zone have insulated plates at either end thereof to reduce heat loss.
8. A kiln as claimed in any preceeding claim, wherein the firing zone has lower and upper sections through which the support means pass in opposite directions, so as to provide heat exchange between the lower and upper sections. 


 9. A kiln as claimed in any preceeding claim, wherein the firing zone comprises an upper fast heat section, and lower vitrification and rapid cooling sections.
10. A kiln as claimed in any preceeding claim, wherein the drying/preheat zone is provided above the cooling zone so as to provide heat exchange between the cooling zone and the drying/preheat zone.
11. A kiln as claimed in any preceeding claim, wherein the drying/preheat zone comprises a drying section and a preheat/mineralise section.
12. A support means for use in a kiln as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, the support means being capable of supporting and transporting one or more pipes through at least one of such zones, and further having means for rotating each pipe along a longitudinal direction thereof.
13.
