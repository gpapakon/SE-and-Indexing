<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical use 
of dihydropyridine derivatives having a specific structure to 
be shown below. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a novel pharmaceutical use of dihydropyridine 
derivatives for promoting PGI₂ production, and for the 
prevention and treatment of hyperlipemia, arteriosclerosis and 
cerebral diseases. PGI₂ (prostacyclin) is one of the substances synthesized by 
arachidonic acid cascade and is confirmed to have many 
physiological actions such as a platelet coagulation-suppressive 
action, a smooth muscle relaxing action, a gastric acid 
secretion-suppressive action, a tunica mucosa ventriculi-protective 
action, an organ blood flow-increasing action and a 
tumor metastasis-suppressive action. PGI₂ synthase is present, particularly in large amounts, in 
vascular endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, 
and various production-stimulating substances promote production 
of PGI₂. From the studies heretofore done with regard to PGI₂, it is 
known that substances such as arachidonic acid, bradykinin, 
histamine, serotonin, thrombin, calcium ionophore A23187, α-toxin, 
leukotriene C₄ and D₄, PDGF (platelet derived growth  
 
factor), HDL-cholesterol, human serum, nitroglycerin, 
angiotensin I and II and vitamin C have PGI₂ production-stimulating 
action. The substances which promote PGI₂ 
production are expected to become drugs useful for the 
diseases, for which the actions of PGI₂, such as vasodilating 
action, bronchodilating action, gastric acid secretion-suppressive 
action and tumor metastasis-suppressive action, 
give the desired effects for improvement. Hyperlipemia, arterioscrelosis and cerebral diseases (e.g., 
cerebral stroke, cerebral edema, cerebral softening, cerebral 
hemorrhage and cerebral infarction) are typical adult diseases 
on the rise in recent years along with the aging society, and 
the development of a pharmaceutical agent effective for the 
prevention and treatment of these diseases is desired. Hyperlipemia is a condition accompanied by an abnormal 
increase in serum lipids, such as cholesterol, triglyceride and 
phospholipid. These lipids form, together with apoprotein, a 
macromolecular complex called lipoprotein in plasma. A 
lipoprotein is classified into five fractions of chylomicron, 
very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein 
(LDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and high density 
lipoprotein (HDL), according to the degree of density. 
Hyperlipemia is, for the
