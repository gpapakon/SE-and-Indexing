<ABSTRACT>
The retractable pin mold has a gate 
valve (160',162',164',166') positioned at the pole of the core. 

The retractable pin (238,240,250) for an injection mold 
machine used for molding golf balls has 

a frictionless bushing means (268) affixed at 
its outer end which is slidable along a 

shaft (260). The shaft (260) and the frictionless bushing 
means (268) are coaxial and perpendicular to the 

retractable pin (238,240,250). The pin head (256) is shaped 
substantially like a dimple.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an injection
mould machine and, more particularly, to an
improved retractable-pin mould used for golf
balls.Conventionally, golf ball covers are made
by either compression moulding two preformed half
shells about a core or by injection moulding of
fluid cover stock material about a core.
Injection moulding uses a mould equipped with
retractable pins that hold the core in place
while the fluid cover stock 1 fills the void
between the core and the inside wall of the
mould. After the fluid ceases to enter the mould
but before the cover stock has completely
hardened, the retractable pins are withdrawn
while the fluid cover stock is still able to flow
and fill the voids left by the pins.
Conventionally, the core is either a solid
one-piece mass of material or a wound core which
comprises a centre wrapped in thin elastic
thread. Typically, a solid core is used.In a conventional retractable-pin mould
used for golf balls a series of conduits
transport the fluid cover stock material to the
individual mould cavity. These conduits are
referred to as runners and are typically
uninsulated. The fluid cover stock material 
travels through the cold runners and passes
into the mold cavity through a series of
ports, referred to as gates, which are positioned
at the mold parting line. Air inside the
mold cavity is displaced by the incoming
fluid cover stock and leaves the mold cavity
through the bushing around the retractable
pins. The retractable pins center the core
in the mold cavity and position the core
in a generally vertical plane.Conventionally, the fluid cover stock
material enters the mold cavity in a horizontal
plane and exerts forces on the core in the
horizontal plane. The core must be centered
in the finished ball since cores that are
off-center produce an unplayable ball.
This means that the flow of cover stock
through the gates and the position of the
gates around the mold cavity must be balanced
to maintain equal and opposite force against
the core so as not to move the core off
center. Additionally, the retractable pins
must be able to resist force from a horizontal
direction even though the pins are positioned
generally in a vertical plane. The horizontal
forces exerted on the pins due to the horizontal
direction of movement of the incoming fluid
cover stock material tend to cause substantial
wear to the pins and pin bushings. Such
damages to the pins cause pin flash and
pin marks in the finished ball, both of
which are undesirable in a high-quality
golf ball. This wear on the

<CLAIMS>
A golf ball retractable pin mould comprising
a pair of mould halves (110,114) meeting in a

mould split plane to define a generally spherical
mould cavity (120);


each mould half (110,114) having a number of
retractable pins (162) extending into the cavity

(120) in generally radial directions and being
inclined to the mould split plane;
each pin (162) being provided at its radially
outer end with a frictionless bushing (164)

carried on a support shaft (166) along which said
bushing (164) can slide, said shaft (166)

extending through the bushing (164) at all
positions of the bushing (164) thereon and being

arranged at right angles to the pin (162), the
movement of said pin (162) being caused solely by

movement of said support shaft (166) and passing
through said bushing (164); and
each end of the shafts (166) for the pins (162)
for each mould half being mounted on a movable

plate (168) which is movable in one direction to
effect extension of the pins (162) associated

therewith into the mould cavity (120) and in the
opposite direction to effect retraction of the

pins (162) out of the mould cavity (120).
A golf ball retractable pin mould as claimed
in claim 1 in which the plates (168) are mounted

for movement in a direction perpendicular to the
mould split plane. 
A golf ball retractable pin mould as claimed
in claim 1 or claim 2 in which the radially inner

end of each of said retractable pins (147) has a
shape substantially similar to that of a golf

ball dimple.
A golf ball retractable pin mould as claimed
in any one of the preceding claims in which said

frictionless bushing (164) is a ball bushing, an
oil bushing or a tetrafluoroethylene fluorocarbon

polymer coated bushing.
