A device for guiding lubricating oil in an internal-combustion engine, with a shell 
arranged between the crank gear and an oil sump and comprising at least one discharge 

opening, and with an intermediate shaft rotating parallel to the crankshaft and 
surrounded at least in part by two struts projecting from the shell, 
characterized in 
that
 the struts (11, 12) together with the shell (8) form a section (13) receiving the 
intermediate shaft (2) and closed opposite the crank gear. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a base (9) of the shell (8) is provided, 
adjacent to the section (13), with a first and a second discharge opening (24 and 

26) arranged in succession with respect to the direction of rotation of the crankshaft 
(1). 
A device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the base (9) is provided, in the 
region of the violin-shaped contour (6, 7) of the connecting rods, with curved segments 

(14, 15) following the said violin-shaped contour (6, 7) and situated in front of the discharge 
openings (24, 26). 
A device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the shell (8) is provided, behind 
the first and second discharge openings (24 and 26 respectively), with at least one 

wiping lip (22 and 23 respectively) orientated in the direction towards the crank gear 
and contrary to the rotational direction thereof and extending to close to a violin-shaped 

contour (6, 7) of the connecting rods. 
A device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the wiping lip (22; 23) is 
arranged on a roof-shaped projection (20; 21) of the shell (8) provided with lateral 

walls (16, 17; 18, 19), wherein a discharge duct (25) comprising the first discharge 

opening (24) is formed between one strut (12) and one projection (20). 
A device according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 a further discharge duct (27) 
comprising the second discharge opening (26) is formed between the projection (20) 

and a further projection (21) provided with a wiping lip (23). 
A device according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that
 at least one wiping means 
(45) extending to close to a counterweight contour (
K
) of the crank gear is arranged at  
 

least on one of the projections (20, 21). 
A device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the ends (30, 31) of the struts 
(11, 12) spaced from the base (9) of the shell (8) rest against wall portions (3, 4) of the 

internal-combustion engine with the interposition of resilient members, in such a way 
that the said wall portions (3, 4) together with the section (13) form a closed volume 

(39) extending along and receiving the intermediate shaft (2). 
A device according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the base (9) comprises a flange 
(10) which is arranged on the outside in a horizontal plane (
H-H
) situated between the 
intermediate shaft (2) and the crankshaft (1) and which rests against the wall portions 

(3, 4) with the interposition of resilient members. 
A device according to Claims 6 and 9, 
characterized in that
 a cavity (28) receiving 
lubricating oil and comprising a single outlet opening (5) arranged in the wall portion 

(4) is formed between one strut (12) and the discharge ducts (25, 27) as well as the 
wall portion (4) adjacent thereto. 
A device according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the resilient members are formed 
by seals (40, 41) which are provided with sealing lips (42, 43) curved so as to rest 

against the wall portions (3, 4). 
A device according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that
 the sealing lips (42, 43) of the 
struts (11, 12) are curved beforehand in the direction of rotation of the crankshaft (1) 

and those of the flange (10) are curved beforehand opposite thereto.
