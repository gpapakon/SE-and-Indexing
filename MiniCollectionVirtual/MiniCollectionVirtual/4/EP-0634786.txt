<ABSTRACT>
A susceptor design (40) for receiving and 
supporting a substrate (20) during processing in a 

substrate processing chamber (10). The susceptor 
includes a front or upper surface (41) having a 

substrate receiving pocket (48) formed therein. The 
pocket has a floor (47) and generally upright sides 

(58). 
A circumscribing groove (54) is formed into the 

floor of the pocket and is dimensioned so that, when 
the substrate is received in the pocket, the groove 

lies generally beyond the perimeter of the substrate. 
The upright sides in conjunction with the groove 

operate to restrict substrate processing gas from 
reaching the underside of the substrate. Also, 

concentric grooves (102) are formed in the floor of 
the pocket. When the substrate is received in the 

pocket it lies on top of these grooves which operate 
to reduce the surface area upon which the substrate 

rests. As a result, after processing, the substrate 
does not stick to the pocket floor and can be lifted 

from the susceptor without damage. Furthermore, a 

stepped formation (42) is formed at the susceptor 
perimeter. The stepped formation interfaces with a 

complemental stepped formation (44) formed in a 
susceptor circumscribing preheat band (24) located in 

the processing chamber, and operates to restrict 
processing gas from reaching the rear or backside 

surface of the susceptor. Additionally, the stepped 
formation includes a plurality of concentric grooves 

(78) formed therein to further restrict the gas from 
reaching the susceptor rear surface. Finally, 

concentric grooves (100) are formed in the susceptor 
rear surface which operate to improve the uniformity 

of the emissivity of the susceptor rear surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method and apparatus 
for depositing polysilicon onto silicon substrates. More 
particularly, this invention relates to an improved susceptor 
for use in such apparatus Doped or undoped silicon layers have been deposited onto 
silicon substrates, such as silicon wafers, using a low pressure 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. A reaction gas mixture 
including a source of silicon, such as silane, disilane, silicon 
tetrachloride and the like, and optionally a dopant gas such as 
phosphine, arsine, diborane and the like, and optionally 
including a carrier gas (such as hydrogen, argon, nitrogen or 
helium), is heated and passed over a silicon substrate to 
deposit a silicon film on the surface of the substrate. The 
exact crystallographic nature of the deposited silicon depends 
upon the temperature of deposition. At low reaction 
temperatures, the deposited silicon is mostly amorphous; when 
higher deposition temperatures are employed, a mixture of 
amorphous silicon and polysilicon or polysilicon alone will be 
deposited.  
 The prior art methods use comparatively low pressures of 
about 200-400 millitorr for this process. Good quality films 
can be formed, but very low deposition rates of about 100 
angstroms/min for undoped, and about 30 angstroms/min for doped, 
polysilicon are obtained. This low deposition rate can be 
overcome by processing a plurality of wafers, i.e., up to 100, 
at once in a batch-type processing chamber. However, present day thin film equipment for the 
semiconductor industry has been moving toward single substrate 
processing, because the processing chambers can be made smaller 
and processing can be better controlled. Further, modern 
semiconductor vacuum processing systems have been developed to 
carry out more than one processing step on a substrate without 
removing the substrate from a vacuum environment. The use of 
such vacuum systems results in a reduced number of particulates 
that contaminate the surface of the wafers during processing, 
thereby improving the device yield. Such vacuum systems include 
a central robotic transfer chamber connected to various 
processing chambers, such as the Applied Materials 5000 series 
processing system described in US Patent 4,951,601 to Maydan et 
al. Thus, CVD equipment for single substrate processing to 
deposit polysilicon onto semiconductor substrates are coming 
into commercial use. A CVD chamber for such purpose has been 
described heretofore and will be described with reference to
