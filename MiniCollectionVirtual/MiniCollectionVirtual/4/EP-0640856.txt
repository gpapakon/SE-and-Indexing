<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a binocular fieldglass having at least one adjustable optical component. The fieldglass in this case comprises at least two telescope halves each having an optical axis which runs through an eyepiece (eye lens) and an objective. In this arrangement, the adjustable optical part is accommodated by a housing tube. In addition, the telescope has between the two telescope halves a further axis which is aligned essentially parallel with respect to the two optical axes and in which an axis member is arranged. According to the invention, the axis member has a longitudinal slot in which an adjusting member is arranged which is displaceable along the longitudinal axis of the axis member. This adjusting member is adjustable in the longitudinal slot from outside the telescope, its axial movement being coupled to the movable optical part in at least one telescope half which contains the optical part to be adjusted.

Binocular telescope (1) comprising at least one adjustable optical component (22) and two
telescope halves (3, 4), whereby each of the telescope halves (3, 4) comprises a housing

tube in each of which an ocular and an objective lens are arranged which each define a
respective optical axis, whereby the adjustable optical component (22) is arranged between

the ocular and the objective lens, whereby a shaft body (5) is arranged between both
telescope halves(3, 4) along a further axis (2) aligned essentially parallel to the optical axes,

whereby the body shaft (5) comprises a longitudinal slot (5a), whereby an adjusting body
(9) being movable in the longitudinal direction of the body shaft (5) is arranged in the

longitudinal slot, whereby the adjusting body (9) is movable in the longitudinal slot (5a)

from outside of the telescope (1), whereby the adjusting body (9) is coupled with the
movable optical component (22) or the movable optical components in at least one of the

telescope halves (3, 4), whereby the adjusting body (9) comprises an external thread (9a)
and whereby a first adjusting button (10) being accessible from outside of the telescope (1)

is arranged at the telescope (1), characterized in that the first adjusting button (10) is
arranged around the adjusting body (9), that the first adjusting button (10) comprises an

internal thread (10a) and that the external thread (9a) ofthe adjusting body (9) is in
engagement with the internal thread of the adjusting button (10).
Binocular telescope of claim 1, characterized in that the adjustable optical component (22)
is the optical component for focusing.
Binocular telescope of claim 1, characterized in that the adjustable optical component (22)
is the optical component for compensation of visual defects.
Binocular telescope of one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the further axis (2) is
used as a hinge shaft for both telescope halves (3, 4). 
Binocular telescope of one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the shaft body (5) is a
round longitudinal rod.
Binocular telescope of one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the adjusting body (9)
is connected to an inner body (16) of a drive knob (23), that the inner body (16) of the drive

knob (23) is connected, freely rotatable, to the adjusting body (9), that at the inner body
(16) an external toothing (18) is provided, that at the drive knob (23) an internal toothing is

provided, that the external toothing (18) of the inner body (16) engages to the internal
toothing (23a) of the drive knob (23) and that a bracket (19) is connected to the inner body

(16) of the drive knob (23) so that a rotation ofthe drive knob (23) changes the position in
axial direction of at least one optical component (22) in one of the telescope halves (3, 4).
Binocular telescope of claim 6, characterized in that the inner body (16) of the drive knob
(23) comprises a thread (17a) that the bracket (19) comprises a thread (17b) and that both

threads (17a, 17b) are in engagement one with the other.
Binocular telescope of claim 6 or 7, characterized in that the drive knob (23) is arranged on
the ocular side.
