<ABSTRACT>
In an ATM switching system with at least one ATM (de-)multiplexer located between the subscriber-side connection lines and an ATM switching network, in such an ATM (de-)multiplexer the n outputs of a switching device, whose mn inputs are connected to mn subscriber-side input lines, are connected to n switching-network-side output lines, in each case n inputs of m switching devices, whose respective n outputs are in each case connected to n subscriber-side output lines, are connected to n switching-network-side input lines and the respective other (m - 1)xn inputs of these m switching devices are connected to the respective n outputs of (m - 1)xm additional switching devices, whose respective mn inputs are connected to the mn subscriber-side input lines.
