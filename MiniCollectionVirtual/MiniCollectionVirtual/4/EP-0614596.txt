<ABSTRACT>
Device for the automatic distribution of telephone and data connections between information sources and equipment using a communication network. The device includes a switch controlled by a central control and monitoring unit connected to a computer terminal, for capturing the communication network's physical architecture. The switch comprises a perforated switch matrix in which pins (90) with conducting rings (91, 92) isolated from one another each electrically connect, at a given connection plane, a first metallic layer (60; 70) to a second metallic layer (62; 72), by means of vertical (67) and horizontal (68) conducting strips provided with metallised holes (65). One of said conducting strips is on one of the surfaces of the first metallic layer and the other is on one of the surfaces of the second metallic layer, the information sources and user equipment being electrically connected exclusively to one or the other of the two sets of conducting strips.
