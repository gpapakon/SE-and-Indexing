<ABSTRACT>
Process for the recovery of monomeric styrene from plastic waste ("rubbish") containing styrene polymers by thermal depolymerisation, the rubbish being conveyed in liquid or solid form into a fluidised bed of a solid heat-transfer medium, cracked or depolymerised with an average residence time of less than 60 seconds and recovered from the gaseous cracking products. Preferably, the heat-transfer medium used is magnesium aluminium silicate and the operating gas for maintaining the fluidised bed C1- to C6-hydrocarbons formed during the depolymerisation as a by-product, which are recycled.

<CLAIMS>
A process for recovering monomeric styrene from plastics
waste containing styrene polymers by thermal

depolymerization, in which the plastics waste in liquid
or solid form is transported into a fluidized bed of a

solid heat transfer agent heated to 400-700°C and is
cracked or depolymerized in an average residence time of

less than 60 seconds and styrene is obtained from the
gaseous crack products, wherein the heat transfer agent

used is magnesium aluminum silicate.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein
C

-C

-hydrocarbons formed as byproducts in the
depolymerization are circulated as operating gas for

maintaining the fluidized bed.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
condensation of the crack products is carried out in two

or more stages, a first condensation stage at from 160
to 200°C and a second stage at up to 40°C being provided

and styrene being obtained from the second condensation
stage.
A process as claimed in claim 1, comprising a
fluidization point of 0.02-0.07 m/s or a particle size

of 30-500 µm.
