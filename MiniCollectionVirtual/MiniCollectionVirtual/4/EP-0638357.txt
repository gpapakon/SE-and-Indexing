<CLAIMS>
A reactor for the preparation of polyacetals in
the form of a flow tube equipped with static mixing

elements, wherein

the reactor is composed of a mixing zone in which the
monomers and the initiator are mixed, a polymerization

zone, a deactivator admixing zone and a deactivation
and stabilization zone, the individual process zones

passing fluidly into one another,
the static mixing elements are arranged in series,
their length and their diameter are adapted to the

individual process step and they are not separated by
built-in backing-up elements or bottlenecks,
the residence time in the mixing zone is from 0.1 to
10 seconds, that in the polymerization zone is from 0.1

to 10 minutes and that in the deactivation and
stabilization zone is from 1 to 10 minutes.
The reactor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
residence time in the deactivation and stabilization

zone is from 2 to 5 minutes.
The reactor as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
the residence time in the polymerization zone is from

0.3 to 5 minutes.
The reactor as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 3, wherein the residence time in the

polymerization zone is from 0.5 to 2 minutes.
The reactor as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 4, wherein the residence time in the mixing zone

is from 0.5 to 5 seconds. 
The reactor as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 5, wherein a devolatilization unit is connected to

the reactor.
The use of a reactor as claimed in one or more
of claims 1 to 6 for the continuous preparation of

polyacetals in the homogeneous phase.
