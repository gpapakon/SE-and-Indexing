<ABSTRACT>
Bicyclic imides of formula (I), wherein the bond linking C-7 and C-8 may be single or double; m is 1-7; RA can occupy one or more of the 2 or 6-8 positions and is independently selected from the group: hydroxy, halogen, CN, OR3, (C1-C4)alkyl, S(O)nR3, COR3, C(O)SR3 and C(O)NR11R12; and Q is a phenylic residue substituted with one or more inorganic and/or organic residues which can be substituted, interrupted and/or combined with the aromatic residue with one or more hetero atoms such as N, O or S, preferably at least in the 4' position. These compounds are made from aryl isocyanates of the general formula Q - N = C = O and proline carboxylic acids. The compounds are useful as herbicides.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel bicyclic imides; a method
for their preparation; and their use as herbicides.It has already been disclosed that certain heterocyclic
imides (see EP-A 272 594, EP-A 493 323, EP-B 0 070 389,
EP-B 0 104 532) can be employed as herbicides.Now novel bicyclic imides have been found that exhibit
markedly better herbicidal activity with excellent
selectivity.The subject of the present invention therefore comprises
compounds of formulae I and II

wherein R is 1-butyn-3-yl, 3-propargyl, allyl.In the definitions within the framework of this invention,
the term "alkyl", used either alone or in compound,
includes straight chain or branched alkyl, e. g., methyl,
ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl or the different butyl isomers. If not otherwise specified the invention relates to both
the individual possible stereoisomers of formulae I and II
and also mixtures of the isomers. Stereoisomers exhibiting
the 2R-configuration are preferred to others.The 2R-configuration exhibits significantly better control,
e. g. up to 8-fold, compared with the 2S-configuration on
undesired plants.Subject of the invention is also a method for preparing the
novel bicyclic imides comprising:
a) reacting a compound of formula III

wherein R is 1-butyn-3-yl, 3-propargyl, allyl
with a compound of formula IV

wherein R1 is H, (C1-C4)alkyl,
or reacting a compound of formula V 

with a compound of formula VI

wherein R1 is H, (C1-C4)alkyl,
and cyclizing the intermediates.
The subject of the present invention is also a method for
preparing bicyclic imides comprising reaction steps selected from group
consisting of b) or c):b) reacting a compound of formula IV with phosgene and then
with an amine of formula VII

to form compounds of formula VIII
wherein R and R1 denote the residues mentioned above,
or reacting a compound of formula VI with phosgene and
then with an amine of formula IX

to form a compound of formula X
 
wherein R1 denotes the residues mentioned above,
and cyclizing the compounds of formulae VIII and X, orc) reacting a compound of formula III with a nitrile of
formula XI

to form compounds of formula XII

wherein R denotes the residues mentioned above,
or reacting a compound of formulae V with a nitrile of
formula XIII

to form a compound of formula XIV 

and hydrolysing and cyclizing the compounds of formulae
XI and XIV.The novel bicyclic imides can be produced in a method
comprising reacting a compound of formula XV

with a halide R-Z, wherein Z is chlorine, bromine or iodine
and R denotes the residues
