<ABSTRACT>
The pneumatic control of the container consists of an elastic, dome-shaped protuberance (19) on the inner lid (12) and thinner than the lid base (14). A self-closing non-return valve (18) has a valve seating (20) cooperating with a valve body (21) kept closed by a spring arrangement (26) joined to the inner lid. The valve body has a head (23) and tappet (24) connected by a click-stop arrangement (33) to the spring arrangement incorporated in the inner lid. The spring arrangement consists of two transverse extensions (27,28) pointing down from the lid-base, and a spring element (25) joined at one end by a film hinge (29) to one transverse extension, and by the other end by a click-stop connection to the other extension.

Closable container (10) for dispensing viscous substances, such as
creams, with an inner lid (12, 46, 57), which is constructed to form an

airtight seal with respect to an inner wall (16) of the container (10) and
has a pneumatic actuating device (17) such that an increased pressure

produced in the container by operation of the actuating device (17)
results in opening of a self-closing check valve (18, 47, 58) so as to

dispense the substance contained in the container and the subsequent
release of the actuating device (17) results in the production of a reduced

pressure in the container, by which the inner lid (12; 46; 57) is moved
down within the container (10) until the reduced pressure dissipates;

characterised in that the pneumatic actuating device (17) comprises a
domed, shape-elastic raised portion (19) of the inner lid (12) with a wall

thickness which is reduced with respect to a lid base (14, 65) and the
self-closing check valve (18, 47, 58) has a valve seat (20, 48, 59)

constructed in the lid base (14, 65) and a valve body (21, 49, 60)
cooperating with the valve seat (20, 48, 59), the valve body (21, 49, 60)

being retained in the closed position by a spring device (26, 64)
connected to the inner lid (12, 46, 57).
Container as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the valve body (21,
49, 60) has a valve head (23, 50, 71) and a valve stem (24, 51, 66), the

valve stem (24, 51, 66) being connected by means of a locking
connection (33, 67) to the spring device (26, 64) which is constructed

integrally with the inner lid (12, 46, 57). 
Container as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the spring
device (64) is constituted by a transverse extension (72) which acts as a

spring element and is directed downwardly from the lid base (65).
Container as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the spring
device (26) comprises two transverse extensions (27, 28), which are

directed downwardly from the lid base, and a spring element (25), which
is connected at its ends to the transverse extensions.
Container as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that the spring element
(25) is connected with one end to the one transverse extension (27) by

means of a film hinge (29) and with the other end to the other transverse
extension (28) by means of a locking connection (31).
Container as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the valve seat (48) comprises an outwardly convex

raised portion of the inner lid (46) and the valve head (50) is provided
with a corresponding, convex surface which completes the convex shape

of the raised portion in the closed position of the check valve (47).
Container as claimed in one or more of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that the valve seat (20, 59) is constructed as a trough-shaped recess in the

inner lid (12, 57) and the valve head (23, 71) constitutes a base portion of
the trough in the closed position.
Container as claimed in Claim 6 or 7, characterised in that in the open 
position of the self-closing check valve (18, 47, 58), a conical shell

segmental gap (39) is defined between the valve head (23, 50, 71) and
the valve seat (20, 48, 59).
Container as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the inner lid (12, 46, 57) is of piston-like

construction and engages with a peripheral sealing edge (15) against the
inner wall (16) of the container (10) so as to be slidable into the container

(10) to dispense the substance in the container (10) and to be locked in
the direction of the container opening.
Container as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in that the peripheral
sealing edge (15) is constructed integrally with the inner lid (12, 46, 57).
Container as claimed in Claim 10, characterised in that the peripheral
sealing edge (15) has two axially spaced sealing lips (40, 41), arranged

between which at the height of the main plane of the inner lid (12; 46;
57) there is a locking element (43) which is directed radially obliquely

outwardly and upwardly and is in engagement with its outer edge against
the inner wall (16) of the container (10) under an elastic biasing force so

as to be slidable downwardly but to be locked in the direction of the
opening of the container (10).
Container as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the
locking element (43) extends continuously and annularly around the

entire periphery of the inner lid (12; 46; 57). 
Container as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the
locking element (43) comprises individual lugs which are separated from

one another by the same circumferential angles.
Container as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 13, characterised in that the
underside of the round dome-shaped actuating device (17) is provided

with ribs which extend radially outwardly from the centre of the dome to
the outer edge of the round dome.
