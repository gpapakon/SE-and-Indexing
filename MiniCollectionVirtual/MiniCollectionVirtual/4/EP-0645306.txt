<ABSTRACT>
A device for use in a machine for packaging bottles in a 
wraparound carton which comprises folders (12) having pivotal 

fingers (13,14) for engaging and folding a pair of bottle heel 
retention flaps (f₁, f₂) and to fold such flaps inwardly of the 

carton. The pivotal folder is adapted to execute a folding 
movement thereby progressively to enter an aperture in the blank 

to fold the flaps and to retrace therefrom during feed movement 
of the blank. The pivotal folder includes a follower (30) to 

execute the folding movement and the retracting movement. The 
pivotal fingers pivot upon radial movement of the folder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carton folding mechanism for a 
machine for packaging articles in, for example, a sleeve 
type wraparound carton. Typically the carton is formed 
from a paperboard blank in which a side wall panel and base 
panel are hinged together along a fold line. Article 
apertures, for example, bottle heel retaining apertures 
incorporating hinged retaining flaps are disposed astride 
the fold line between the carton panels. The machine in 
which the mechanism of the present invention may be 
incorporated includes a conveyor for advancing a blank and 
the articles to be packaged along a predetermined feed 
path. The mechanism folds such retaining flaps into their 
required positions inwardly of the carton. The present 
invention is concerned with the inward folding of pairs of 
such retaining flaps associated with each article retention 
apertures. The flaps of each pair of flaps are engaged and 
folded inwardly while the adjacent portions of the blank 
are held against any substantial sidewise movement by 
suitable guide means. It is known from EP-0 200 445 to provide article retaining 
features such as bottle heel retention apertures in the base 
and side walls of a wraparound carton which receive a heel 
portion of an article such as a bottle packaged in the  
 
carton. Such heel retaining features normally are struck 
from the side and base wall panels of a wraparound carton 
and comprise flaps which are hingably attached to the carton 
panel. In the flat blank the flaps close the apertures 
which are to provide the bottle heel retention apertures of 
the carton. When the blank is applied to a group of 
articles, it is known to open the flaps using a simple 
finger mechanism to later enable the heel of the article to 
be received in the aperture created. A mechanism for achieving this function is disclosed in EP-0 
200 445 and comprises a mechanism for engaging and folding 
a pair of bottle heel retention flaps so that the flaps are 
folded inwardly of the carton. The folding mechanism 
includes a pivotal folder comprising a pair of pivotal 
fingers which are cam actuated so as to execute a folding 
movement whereby the fingers progressively enter a retention 
aperture in the blank to fold the flaps and to execute a 
retracting movement. These folding and retracting movements 
occur during linear feed movement of the carton blank and 
the pivotal folder together. The pivotal folders operate 
sequentially upon a blank to fold open a row of such heel 
retention flaps and, in a folding

A device for use in a machine for packaging articles in a wraparound carrier of 
the type formed from a blank (C) having a pair of walls adjoined together along a fold 

line and having a pair of article retaining and blank reinforcing flaps (F1, F2) disposed 
astride said fold line, said device comprising folding means for engaging and folding 

said pair of flaps (F1, F2) and to fold such flaps (F1, F2) inwardly of the carrier, said 
folding means (10) comprising a folder (12) adapted to execute a folding movement 

thereby progressively to enter an aperture (A) in the blank (C) to fold the flaps (F1, 
F2) and thereafter to retract from said aperture during feed movement of the blank (C), 

said folder (12) including blank engaging portion and means (30) for co-operating with 
actuating means (32) to pivot the blank engaging portion during said folding 

movement and said retracting movement characterised in that said co-operating means 
(30) is radially moveable with respect to an axis of the device and said blank engaging 

portion comprises a pair of divergently pivotal fingers (14, 16) adapted to pivot upon 
radial movement of said co-operating means (30) with respect to said axis. 
A device according to claim 1 wherein said co-operating means comprises a 
cam follower (30) which rides in an endless cam track (32) contoured so as to cause 

pivotal movement of said fingers (14, 16). 
A device according to claim 2 wherein said folding means (10) comprises a 
rotatable plate assembly (34, 36, 38) incorporating said folder (12) and said endless 

cam track (32).  
 
A device according to claim 3 wherein said plate assembly comprises, in axial 
series, a cam plate (34), an intermediate plate (36) incorporating said folders (12) and a 

top plate (38) and wherein the intermediate (36) and top plates (38) are rotatable 
relative to the cam plate (34). 
A device according to claim 4 wherein said plates (34, 36, 38) are discs. 
A device according to claim 4 wherein said folder (12) comprises a body (26) 
which is mounted for radial movement in said intermediate plate (36) which body 

carries said cam follower (30). 
A device according to claim 5 wherein said body (26) terminates in a head (24) 
comprising a pair of said pivotal fingers (14, 16) which provide the blank engaging 

portion of said folder (12). 
A device according to claim 6 wherein said pivotal fingers (14, 16) are caused 
to pivot substantially simultaneously. 
A device according to claim 7 wherein said body (26) is slidably mounted in a 
radial track (28) provided in the intermediate disc (36). 
A device according to any of claims 3 to 9, wherein said plate assembly (34, 
36, 38) comprises a plurality of folders (12) arranged in discrete groups whereby a 

separate one of said groups of folders (12)  
 

is provided for each successive carton (B) to be engaged.
