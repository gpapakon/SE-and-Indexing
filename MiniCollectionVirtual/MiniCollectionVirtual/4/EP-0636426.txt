<ABSTRACT>
A device for cleaning preferably metallic workpieces, in particular for removing solid and/or liquid residues such as sand, chips, lubricant or the like has an immersion container (10) for a washing liquid (16) and a receiving device (20) for the workpieces (1) to be cleaned, the receiving device (20) being rotatable about an axis of rotation. The receiving device (20) can be pivoted about an essentially horizontal pivoting axis (25) running above the immersion container between two positions, the first of which arranges the receiving device (20) above the liquid level (15) in the immersion container (Fig. 1) and the second of which arranges the receiving device in the immersion container with an essentially vertically running axis of rotation (Fig. 2).

A device for cleaning preferably metallic workpieces
(1), in particular for removing solid and/or liquid residues

such as sand, chippings, lubricant or the like, comprising a
dip tank (1) for a washing liquid (16) and an accommodating

device (20) for the workpieces to be cleaned, wherein the
accommodating device (20) is moveable about a substantially

horizontal pivot axis (25) extending above the dip tank so
that the accommodating device (20) can assume positions

above and positions below the liquid level (15) in the dip
tank (10), characterised in that the accommodating device

(20) is also rotatable about an axis of rotation (26) which
differs from the pivot axis (25) and that the accommodating

device (20) can be swivelled about the pivot axis (25)
between two positions, of which the first position arranges

the accommodating device above the liquid level (15) in the
dip tank (10) and the second position arranges the

accommodating device (20) in the dip tank (10) with the axis
of rotation (26) extending substantially vertically.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the swivel angle (27) about the pivot axis (25) amounts to

approximately 90Â°.
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that nozzles (40), connected to a pressure line (45) for

washing liquid and/or air, for directing a flow towards the 
workpiece (1) in the accommodating device (20) are arranged

in the dip tank (10).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a vaporizer or maintenance system (39)

for waste-water-free operation is arranged downstream of the
dip tank (10).
A method of cleaning preferably metallic workpieces, in
particular for removing solid and/or liquid residues such as

sand, chippings, lubricant or the like, wherein the
workpieces (1) are clamped in an accommodating device (20)

and moved into a dip tank (10), characterised in that
following the clamping of the workpiece (1) above the liquid

level (15) of the dip tank (10), the accommodating device
(20) with the workpiece (1) is swivelled about a pivot axis

(25) into the dip tank (10) and the workpiece (1) is rotated
about an axis of rotation (26) which differs from the pivot

axis (25).
A method according to Claim 5, characterised in that
the liquid (16) in the dip tank (10) is completely replaced

following each cleaning process.
