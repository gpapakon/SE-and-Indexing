<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of forming a
diamond crystal which has superior characteristics as electronic
materials.Diamonds have various superior characteristics which
cannot be obtained by other materials, i.e., a large band
gap (5.5 eV), large carrier mobility (electron; 1800
cm2/V·S, hole; 1600 cm2/V·S), large thermal conductivity
[200 W/(m·K)], high hardness, and high wear resistance.Therefore, methods of synthesizing diamonds from the
vapor phase, particularly, a chemical vapor deposition
process, have been studied recently.Main methods of forming diamonds are as follows.
1) A thermal filament CVD process in which material gas is
decomposed by heating a filament made of, e.g., tungsten to
about 2000 °C so that a diamond crystal is deposited on a
substrate.2) A microwave plasma CVD process in which material gas is 
decomposed by microwave plasma (usually at 2.45 GHz) so that
a diamond crystal is deposited on a substrate.3) An RF plasma CVD process in which material gas is
decomposed by RF plasma (usually at 13.56 MHz) so that a
diamond crystal is deposited on a substrate.4) A burning flame process in which a diamond crystal is
formed by using an oxygen - acetylene flame.5) An ECR plasma CVD process in which material gas is
decomposed by forming ECR (Electron Cyclotron Resonance)
discharge in combination of a microwave and a magnetic field
so that a diamond crystal is formed on a substrate.6) A thermal plasma CVD process in which material gas is
decomposed by DC or high-frequency thermal plasma under a
pressure near the atmospheric pressure so that a diamond
crystal is formed.7) Of late, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-32489 proposes
a plasma CVD process using plasma in the ultrashort wave
range of 30 to 300 MHz.However, the prior art methods of forming a diamond
crystal described above have problems below.The thermal filament CVD process of 1) is advantageous
in that a diamond crystal can be formed in a large area and
at a relatively high forming rate, but is disadvantageous in
that the filament is carbonized or deteriorated over time
and reproducibility in forming diamonds is low. The microwave plasma CVD process of 2) is advantageous
in that the plasma density is high, the forming rate of a
diamond crystal is relatively high, and the reproducibility
is good, but is disadvantageous in that plasma tends to
localize, making it difficult to form a diamond crystal in a
large area.The RF plasma CVD process of 3) is advantageous in that
a diamond crystal can be formed in a large area and
