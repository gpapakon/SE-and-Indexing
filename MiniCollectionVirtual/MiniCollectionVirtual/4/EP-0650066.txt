<ABSTRACT>
An optical current transducer comprises four Faraday effect glass elements (11A to 14A) and 
optical-path changing pieces (15A to 17A) which arranged to form an optical path around a 

through hole (20), and which are fixed while being sandwiched between two substrates (21, 
22), so that no adhesion using an adhesive agent is required. Thus, a measurement error due 

to internal stress which would occur in the glass elements due to a difference in coefficient of 
thermal expansion when an adhesive agent is used can be prevented. The optical-path changing 

pieces (15A to 17A) are respectively formed of an integral element and two reflection 
surfaces are formed by cutting, whereby no adhesive agent is necessary. The optical-path 

changing pieces (15A to 17A) are also used as spacers for defining the interval between the 
two substrates (21, 22), and the four glass elements (11A to 14A) are sandwiched between 

the two substrates so that gaps are formed between the substrates and the glass elements 

through grooves provided in the two substrates to prevent occurrence of a stress due to clamping. 
Even when the glass elements (11A to 14A) are displaced within the gaps, the incident 

light and the emission light are in parallel to each other, so that the optical path surrounding 
the through hole (20) is not deviated to such an extent that the measurement precision is 

affected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical current transducer which is used to measure relatively large
currents flowing through a high-voltage conductor such as in a gas insulated power circuit
interrupter, by utilizing the Faraday effect.Current can be measured by utilizing the Faraday effect, i.e., a rotation phenomenon of the
polarization plane of polarized light under the influence of a magnetic field established by the
current to be measured. When polarized light is transmitted through a medium exhibiting the
Faraday effect such as lead glass (hereinafter referred to as Faraday effect glass) and the
medium is exposed to a magnetic field, the polarization plane is rotated by an angle of
⊖ = V·H·L (V:Verdet's constant, H:intensity of magnetic field in light travelling direction, L:glass
length in light traveling direction). By detecting the angle ⊖ the magnetic-field
intensity H can
be measured by a well-known method. Where the magnetic field is caused by an electric
current flowing in the neighborhood of the Faraday effect glass the value of the current can be
calculated on the basis of the magnetic-field intensity H.In many cases, plural conductors are disposed at an ordinary current measuring place, and thus
there is a problem that a measurement is affected by magnetic field components which are
caused by currents of conductors other than a conductor to be measured and this results in a
measurement error. As an optical current transducer for solving the above problem by nullifying
the effect of currents of the conductors other than the target conductor to be measured has
been known an optical current transducer in which an optical path surrounding the conductor
whose current is to be obtained, is set up and Faraday effect glass elements are disposed on
the optical path.Fig. 19 is a projection view of a conventional optical current transducer. Fig. 19(A) is a plan
view, and side views thereof are provided at the surrounding portions on the basis of trigonometry.
That is, Figs. 19(B), 19(C),19(D) and 19(E) are side views of Fig. 19(A) which are
viewed from the right side, upper side, left side and lower side, respectively. In this figure, rod-shaped
Faraday effect glass elements 11, 12, 13 and 14 are disposed in a square form, and
three optical-path changing pieces 15, 16 and 17 are provided at three of the four corners of
the square. These elements are fixed to a substrate 2 with an adhesive agent, and also fixed to
each other with an adhesive agent. A through hole 20 is provided at the center of the
