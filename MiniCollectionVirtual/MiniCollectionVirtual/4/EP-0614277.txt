<ABSTRACT>
When delay circuits consisting of an iterative circuit of gates are constructed as CMOS circuits, they have the disadvantage that the typical delay time of one CMOS gate deviates by a factor of between 0.5 and 2.0 as a function of temperature changes and changes in the operating voltage and of changes in the process speed and thus necessitates a wide tolerance range of the delay time in a delay circuit. The delay time is essentially determined by the RC product of the dynamic output impedance of the driving gate and the input capacitance of the driven gate. According to the invention, the output current of a CMOS gate is kept constant under different operating conditions by means of constant current sources implemented by current balancing circuits. Thus, the output impedance also remains constant and the tolerance range of the gate transit time is thus significantly restricted. This allows a delay circuit having narrow tolerances to be produced in CMOS technology, omitting non-CMOS-typical effects and expensive manufacturer-specific additional processes.
