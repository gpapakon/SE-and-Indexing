<ABSTRACT>
An adaptive method of detecting a misfiring cylinder in a spark-ignited internal combustion engine during substantially all engine operating conditions, including most no-load operation. The method includes the step of normalising an engine acceleration-independent and engine speed-independent power cycle time differential signal for a particular cylinder of the engine, obtained from consecutive power cycle time periods of an engine cycle, utilising a calibration parameter stored in the memory for the particular cylinder, to obtain a normalised power cycle time differential signal for the particular cylinder. The method also includes the step of comparing the normalised power cycle time differential signal to a misfire threshold signal stored in the memory to determine if the cyclinder is misfiring. Preferably, the misfire threshold signal is based on at least one engine operating parameter. The method also includes the step of adaptively modifying the calibration parameter stored in the memory based on the comparison.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of detecting 
cylinder misfire and, more particularly, to an adaptive 
method of detecting cylinder misfire in an internal 
combustion engine. The prior art teaches a variety of systems for 
diagnosing operating parameters of an internal combustion 
engine. One such operating parameter is cylinder misfire. 
When a cylinder misfires, incomplete combustion occurs and 
uncombusted fuel is typically introduced into the exhaust 
system. Additionally, a misfiring cylinder degrades engine 
performance and efficiency. United States patent number 3,972,230, issued to Hanson 
et al., discloses an apparatus and method for detecting a 
malfunction in the cylinders of an internal combustion 
engine. While the engine is operated at an idle speed, 
power cycle time periods between successive ignition time 
are measured to obtain the deceleration rates between 
successive time periods. Average deceleration rates for the 
respective cylinders are computed and misfires occurring 
randomly in the cylinders are detected when individual 
deceleration rates exceed the average deceleration rates for 
the corresponding cylinder by a predetermined limit amount. Other United States patents relating generally to the 
detection of cylinder misfire or other cylinder malfunctions 
include 4,179,922 issued to Bouverie et al., 4,930,479 
issued to Osawa et al., 5,041,980 issued to Maddock et al., 
5,044,195 issued to James et al., 5,056,360 issued to 
Dosdall et al. and 5,109,695, issued to James et al. Some engine control systems utilise data from a sensor 
that cooperates with a wheel, having a plurality of teeth, 
which is used for detecting engine position in an engine 
cycle. Existing misfire detection strategies, however, are 
limited by the operating conditions during which misfire can 
be detected. For example, misfire detection is difficult 
during high speed, no-load operating conditions because of,  
 
among other reasons, the production inaccuracies of the 
multi-toothed wheel. One technique for correcting such 
inaccuracies is shown in the United States patent number 
5,117,681, issued to Dosdall et al. This technique, 
however, requires a special measurement. According to the present invention, there is provided 
an adaptive method of detecting a misfiring cylinder in a 
spark-ignited internal combustion engine controlled by an 
electronic controller having a memory, the method comprising 
the steps of: 
obtaining an engine speed-independent percent power 
cycle time differential signal

obtaining an engine speed-independent percent power 
cycle time differential signal for a particular cylinder 

based on consecutive power cycle time periods of an engine 
cycle; 
normalising the engine speed-independent percent power

in the memory and associated with the cylinder, to obtain a

approximately zero.
