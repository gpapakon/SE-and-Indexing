<ABSTRACT>
The method involves electrolytically depositing a precursor of the CuInSe2 compound on an Mo substrate. A sub-layer 
<
  1  mu m thick comprising 
>
 50 At % In, the remainder being at least partly Cu, is deposited first, then a layer containing 
>
 50 At % Cu is deposited to bring the In/Cu ratio of the entire layer substantially to 1/1. An amount of solid and/or gaseous Si corresponding to at least 100 At % of the overall In/Cu layer is brought into contact with said layer and the compound is formed by means of a heat reaction at Se vapour pressure in a neutral atmosphere.
