<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image projection
method and a semiconductor device manufacturing method
using the same. More particularly, the invention is
concerned with an improved image projection method
suitable for forming on a wafer a circuit pattern of a
linewidth not greater than 0.5 micron and with an
improved semiconductor device manufacturing method
based on such an image projection method.The degree of integration of each
semiconductor device such as IC, LSI or the like has
been increased more and more and, along this, the fine
processing technique has been improved considerably.
Particularly, the exposure technique which is the
major processing technique in semiconductor device
manufacturing processes has been advanced into a
submicron region, with manufacture of 1 mega-DRAM. A
representative exposure apparatus therefor is a
reduction projection exposure apparatus, called a
stepper. It is not an overestimation to say that the
resolution of such a stepper determines the future of
semiconductor devices.Conventionally adopted method for improving
the resolution of the stepper is mainly to enlarge the 
numerical aperture (NA) of a projection optical system
(reduction lens system). Since however the depth of
focus of a projection optical system is in inverse
proportion to the square of the NA, enlarging the NA
results in a decrease of the depth of focus, causing a
difficulty of forming on a wafer an image of good
contrast. In consideration of this problem, recently
adopted method for enhancing the resolution is to use
shorter wavelengths for the exposure light, such as by
using i-line light (365 nm) or KrF excimer laser light
(248 nm) in place of g-line light (436 nm). This
relies upon an effect that both the depth of focus and
the resolution of an optical system increase in
inverse proportion to the wavelength.On the other hand, independently of enlarging
the NA of a projection optical system or using shorter
wavelengths of exposure light, there is a method of
improving the resolution of a stepper by illuminating
a reticle in a specific manner. An example according
to this method is that a reticle is illuminated with
the light which forms a ring-like effective light
source (a virtual light source formed by zeroth order
light) at a pupil of a projection optical system.
With this method, diffraction light (zeroth and first
orders) produced by a circuit pattern of a reticle can
be projected onto the pupil of the projection optical
system. Another method for improving the resolution,
having been
