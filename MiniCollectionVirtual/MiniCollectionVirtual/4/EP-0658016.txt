<ABSTRACT>
The optical emitter has a laser light source (9) and an electro-optical modulator (12) which has a non-linear characteristic. The modulator (12), e.g. a Mach-Zehnder modulator, obtains its electric input signal (11) directly from the output amplifier (10). The modulator (12) is connected to a non-linear termination network (15) which simultaneously forms the terminal resistance and compensates for the non-linear characteristic of the electro-optical modulator (12).
