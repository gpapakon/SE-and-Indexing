<ABSTRACT>
Techniques for controlling a process which is performed at least in part by a device 
such as a computer operating system. The techniques involve a process server which 

controls the process in response to indications that steps of the process have taken 
place, an envelope which encloses the device and generates event messages when the 

device performs operations, and a translator which translates steps of the process into 
sequences of events and monitors the event messages. When the translator 

determines that a sequence of events which constitute a process step has occurred, it 
provides an indication that the step has occurred to the process server. In a preferred 

embodiment, the device is an operating system, the envelope is a dynamically-linked 
library of file system commands, the translator includes the Yeast event-action 

system, and the process server is a process control system which models entities 
involved in the process as objects and makes state transitions by firing rules which 

modify the objects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed generally towards the controlling of the execution 
of process steps and more specifically towards controlling of process steps 
performed via a computer system where users specify a representation of the 
process whose execution is controlled by the computer system. A process is an ordered set of steps to be followed in attaining an end. 
The end of the process may be an article of manufacture, an item such 
as a computer program, a business plan, or a design, or a change of status 
(for example, a permit to begin construction). In the following discussion, 
developers is used to refer to the humans who carry out the process. Processes may vary across organizations and systems. A process step corresponds 
to a set of events that occur on entities. When the process involves 
a computer, many of the events will occur within the computer system. We 
say that a step has occurred when the corresponding set of events have occurred. 
For example, a process step may correspond to the invocation of a 
particular software tool on a particular entity to accomplish a task, such as 
a manager reviewing and formatting a document using an editor. In this 
case, the software tool is the editor and the step corresponds to the following 
events: the manager invokes the editor, the editor opens the document.  
 
the manager modifies the document, and finally the manager terminates the 
invocation of the editor. A process step may also correspond to events that 
occur outside the computer system, such as holding a decision-making meeting; 
the beginning and completion of the step must be announced explicitly 
by a user. Typically, the steps of a process must be carried out in a particular order. 
The ordering is not necessarily serial; steps can occur in parallel. Additionally, 
the ordering can either be partial (only some steps must be executed in 
a particular order) or total (the ordering of steps is strict). Work in the field of process control has focused on two aspects: (1) devising 
useful notations, called process modeling languages, by which the desired 
process is specified; and (2) investigating process control mechanisms 
by which computers may assist users in carrying out the specified processes. A process control system is a computer system that provides a process 
modeling language for specifying processes and provides computer-aided control 
over the execution of such processes. A variety of process modeling languages 
have been proposed, including rule-based languages, Petri

representation of a portion of the process which is performed in the device; and 
   means in the computer system coupled to the representation which 

selectively responds to the event messages as required by the representation of the 
portion of the process and modifies the modifiable representation as required 

by the event messages.
