<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an industrially useful
method of producing cis-1-aminoindan-2-ol.Cis-1-aminoindan-2-ol is important as a medical
intermediate. For example, this compound is disclosed as a useful
intermediate for producing anti-HIV medicines. See J. Med. Chem.,
35, 2525 (1992), J. Med. Chem., 35, 1702 (1992), J. Med. Chem., 35,
1685 (1992), etc. Also, as disclosed in J. Chem. Soc. Chem.
Commun., 1992, 1673, it is useful as a material for synthesizing
optically-active hydroxyesters. Several methods have been disclosed
for producing cis-(±)-1-aminoindan-2-ol. For example, Lutz, et al.
[J. Am. Chem. Soc., 73, 1639 (1951)] treated trans-(±)-2-bromoindan-1-ol
with concentrated aqueous ammonia to form trans-(±)-1-aminoindan-2-ol,
amidated it with benzoyl chloride, and then formed
a cis-(±)-2-phenyloxazoline derivative by a ring closure, which was
thereafter hydrolyzed to obtain the aimed cis-(±)-1-aminoindan-2-ol.
Rittle, et al. (Tetrahedron lett., 1987, 521) introduced cis-(±)-1-aminoindan-2-ol
to L-phenylalaninamide, separated the resulting
mixture by chromatography, and then used a sodium ethoxide treatment
to form optically-active cis-1-(-)-aminoindan-2-ol as follows: Though the method of Lutz, et al. is relatively effective,
it requires multiple steps since the product is made by way of
trans-(±)-1-aminoindan-2-ol. Also, it is disadvantageous in that a
large quantity of waste water and liquid is yielded as a by-product
while the volume efficiency becomes low.Hassner, et al. [J. Org. Chem., 32, 540 (1967)] heated
ethyl-N-(trans-2-iodo-1-indan) carbamate in glyme anhydride to form
cis-indano[1,2-d]-2-oxazolidone by a ring closure, which was then
hydrolyzed to obtain the aimed cis-(±)-1-aminoindan-2-ol as follows: 
However, though the carbamate used as the starting material
here can be obtained by an addition reaction of iodoisocyanate to
indene, the method of synthesizing iodoisocyanate is difficult and
thus has not been considered industrially applicable. Also, it is
disadvantageous in that a high temperature is required for forming
the oxazolidone and so on.Didier, et al. [Tetrahedron, 47, 4941 (1991)] reduced 2-oxoindan-1-methyl
carboxylate into optically-active cis-(+)-2-hydroxy-1-methyl
carboxylate by using baker's yeast. From this
optically-active compound, the aimed cis-(+)-1-aminoindan-2-ol and
cis-(-)-1-aminoindan-2-ol were obtained by way of multiple synthesis
steps as follows: 
However, this method is disadvantageous in that an unusual
reaction agent is necessary and in that
