<ABSTRACT>
A medical instrument which is insertable into an 
arterial system to incise an arterial stenosis is provided 

and includes a cutting member (32) selectively covered by a 
catheter sheath (16). The sheath (16) is shaped to provide 

protection against unintentional incisions during insertion 
and placement of the device. Longitudinal slots (26) are formed 

by the body of the sheath (16) and are engaged by alignment lugs (34) 
included on the cutting member (32) such that the interaction 

between the slots (26) and the lugs (34) provides the surgeon with 
added control over the length of the incisions. In 

operation, the device is placed next to a stenosis and the 
cutting member (32) is advanced relative to the sheath (16) to 

longitudinally incise the stenosis. After incising the 
stenotic segment, an inflatable balloon included on the 

device is placed in the stenotic segment and standard 
dilation is performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains generally to medical 
devices for reducing the flow restriction caused by a 
stenosis in an artery. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to devices for incising an arterial 
stenosis. The present invention is particularly, but not 
exclusively, useful for longitudinally incising an arterial 
stenosis prior to and in conjunction with angioplasty. It is well known that any significant reduction or 
restriction in the flow of blood through the arteries of 
the body can cause complications which may have serious 
consequences. Arterial blockages caused by plaque and 
fibrosis build-up in the arteries are known to be a leading 
cause of heart attacks, strokes, and other debilitating 
maladies. Accordingly, it is extremely important for the 
health of a patient that any stenosis, or blockage, which 
is causing such a condition, be eliminated or reduced. Fortunately, with the advent of so-called bypass 
surgery techniques, the consequences of blockages in 
various arteries can be alleviated by grafting replacement 
arterial tissue to the affected artery. In this manner, 
blood is allowed to bypass the blockage in the affected 
artery and the blood supply to the body tissue which is 
downstream from the blockage is thereby restored. While 
bypass surgical procedures have become relatively safe, 
reliable, and effective, portions of the body must 
nevertheless be opened to accomplish the surgery. In other 
words, bypass surgery is invasive, and can consequently 
require significant post-operative recovery time. To avoid 
the drawbacks associated with invasive bypass surgery, less 
invasive surgical procedures have been developed wherein a 
device is inserted into the bloodstream of a patient and 
advanced into an artery to reduce or remove an arterial 
stenosis.  
 One well known and frequently used procedure to 
accomplish this task is popularly known as angioplasty. 
For a basic angioplasty procedure, a dilating balloon is 
positioned across the particular stenotic segment and the 
balloon is inflated to open the artery by breaking up and 
compressing the plaque which is creating the stenosis. The 
plaque, however, remains in the artery and is not removed. 
Unfortunately, in some cases, it appears that the plaque 
which remains in the artery may still present a stenosis. 
Furthermore, in approximately 30-60% of the vessels treated 
by angioplasty, there is a re-stenosis. This high 
recurrence rate is thought to be the result of fibrotic 
contraction in the lumen of

further comprises restricting means (26) included in said catheter sheath (16) 

for limiting and aligning reciprocations of said cutting member (18), said 
restricting means (26) engaging said cutting member (18). 
A device (10) according to Claim 1 wherein said receiving means (22, 24) 
prevents said cutting means (32) from contacting said tissue (38) when said cutting 

member (18) is in said retracted position. 
A device (10) according to Claim 2 wherein said receiving means (22, 24) 
comprises an internal coaxial void defined by said inner surfac
e, and an 
opening (22, 24) formed by said distal end (20) of said sheath (16), said opening being 

shaped and sized to allow said cutting means (32) to exit said coaxial void. 
A device (10) according to any one of the preceding claims further 
comprising a plurality of alignment lugs (34) radially extending from and 

attached to said shaft (28) proximally of said cutting means (32), said  
 

alignment lugs (34) slidingly engaging said restricting means (26) to limit and align 
said reciprocations of said cutting member (18), and said shaft (28) being hollow. 
A device (10) according to Claim 4 wherein said restricting means (26) is a 
plurality of longitudinal slots (26) formed by said inner surface of said sheath (16). 
A device 10 according to any one of the preceding claims wherein said 
cutting means (32) comprises at least one cutting blade (32) attached to and radially 

extending from said shaft (28). 
A device (10) according to any one of Claims 1 to 5 wherein said 
cutting means (32) comprises a plurality of cutting blades (32) attached to and
