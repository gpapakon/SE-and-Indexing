<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a noise reduction wall intended to attenuate the perception of a noise source in a region to be protected, composed:   (a) of acoustic absorption elements consisting of panels (29) made of an absorbent material, each of the said absorbent panels (29) being associated with a rigid support (30), and (b) of a bearing structure (16) supporting the said elements and consisting of a plurality of posts (16) arranged at substantially regular intervals along a line substantially parallel to the traffic lane (track) (12) to be insulated, each of the said posts being provided with fasteners (37) which support the said panels (29) and of which the height position on the post (16) is adjustable, the said wall rising at the edge of the traffic lane (12) to a height H greater than the distance h separating the noise source (13) from the ground (2) in which it is implanted.   The noise reduction wall of the aforementioned type is characterised in that the rigid support (30) associated with each panel (29) consists of a section which comprises a plane web (34) provided with a loop along each of its horizontal longitudinal edges, the upper loop (35) of the support (30) of each panel (29) being capable of cooperating by engagement, by horizontal longitudinal displacement, with the lower loop (36) of the support (30) of the panel or panels (29) at the higher level. Application in particular to eliminating noise beside railway tracks or road traffic lanes.

A noise reduction wall, intended to reduce the perception of a noise source
(13) in an area to be protected, comprising: (a) sound-absorbing elements, consisting

of panels (29) of absorbent material, particularly wood-based, each of said absorbent
panels (29) being attached to a rigid support (30), and (b) a supporting structure (16)

supporting said elements and consisting of multiple posts (16) positioned at
substantially regular intervals along a line substantially parallel to the railway or

roadway (12) to be isolated, each of said posts being equipped with hooks (37) which
enable supporting the said absorbent panels (29), the height of whose position on the

post (16) is adjustable, said wall being erected at the side of the way (12) to a height
(H) greater than the distance (h) separating the noise source (13) from the ground (2)

in which it is built, and characterised in that the rigid support (30) attached to each
panel (29) consists of a section, preferably made of metal, said rigid support

comprising a flat web (34) equipped with a curled lip along each of its longitudinal
horizontal edges, the upper curled lip (35) of the support (30) of each panel (29) being

adapted to co-operate by interlocking, by longitudinal horizontal displacement, with
the lower curled lip (36) of the support (30) of the panel(s) (29) of the next level up.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the rigid
support (30) attached to each panel (29) is of a width at least equal to the height (L) of

the panel.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised in that
the rigid support (30) attached to each panel (29) is located on the one (31) of the two

major faces of the panel which is to be positioned facing the plane formed by the line
of posts (16).
A noise reduction wall as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the absorbent panels (29) are rectangular and assembled lengthwise with respect

to one another by interlocking.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the panels (29) are positioned lengthwise horizontally and are staggered.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that the absorbent material is made of cement and wood fibre.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that each of the said posts (16) consists of a four-edged tube open longitudinally on

the one of its faces which faces the noise source (13), and in that the hooks (37) 
enabling fixture of the acoustic elements (29) on the post (16) are arranged opposite

the opening (26) on the said post so that the said sound absorbing elements are
between the noise source and the line of posts.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that each of the posts (16) consists of a four-edged tube open longitudinally on the

one of its faces which is the farthest from the noise source (13), and in that the hooks
(37) enabling fixture of the acoustic elements (29) on the post (16) are arranged

opposite the opening (26) on the said post so that the line of posts is between the noise
source and the said sound absorbing elements.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in Claim 8, characterised in that each post
(16) is, in conventional fashion, made in two parts, a hollow tubular footing (20),

fixed in the ground (2), and the post proper (16), whose lower part (21), intended to
be a force fit in the footing (20), is straight and has an external cross-section

congruent with and slightly smaller than the internal cross-section of the footing.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in that at least the
upper part (16) of the post emerging from the footing (20) is of square or rectangular

C-shaped cross-section, the opening (26) in the C being edged along its length by two
returns, of substantially the same width, themselves formed of two flanges, the first

flanges (27) of the two returns defining, together with the opening (26), one (25) of
the four faces of the post and the second flanges (28) of the said returns, bordering the

opening (26), being turned back towards the interior of the post (16).
A noise reduction wall as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised
in that its supporting structure consists, at least in part, of posts (416) whose upper

part, emerging from the footing (20) is, from bottom to top, first vertical and straight,
and then curved, the concavity (417) of this curve facing towards the ground, on the

noise source side.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised
in that its supporting structure consists, at least in part, of posts (216,316) inclined

wholly or partly to the vertical, said inclination being turned towards the noise source
(13), and the plane in which is located each post being substantially perpendicular to

the said wall.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised
in that its supporting structure consists, at least in part, of posts (516) whose entire

upper part emerging from the footing (20) is curved, the concavity (517) of the curve 
of each of the said posts facing towards the ground (2) on the noise source side (13),

and each curved post (516) belonging to a plane substantially perpendicular to the
said wall.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in any one of Claim 1 to 13, characterised in
that each hook (37) is S-shaped, the free part of the S extending upwards and being, at

its end, folded back on itself, in the direction of the opening (26) of the post (16) to
which the hook (37) is fixed, to form a pin (38), the free part of the S fixing, with the

inside of the pin, the end of the curved lip (36) on the upper support to which it is
attached and guiding and supporting via the outside of the said pin (38), the curved lip

(35) of the lower section, which is also connected to it.
A noise reduction wall as claimed in Claim 14, characterised in that with the
exception of its hooks (44,37) at the top and bottom levels, the said hooks are
