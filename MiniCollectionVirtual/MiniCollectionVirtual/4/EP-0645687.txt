<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reference voltage 
generation circuit incorporated into a semiconductor 
integrated circuit and, in particular, to a reference 
voltage generation circuit whose circuit operation is 
not affected by the characteristic of elements, intrusion 
of noise. A reference voltage generation circuit incorporated 
into a semiconductor integrated circuit is shown in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,263,519 issued to Schade, Jr. The reference 
voltage generation circuit includes two NPN type 
bipolar transistors, three resistors for determining a 
reference voltage level, differential-input amplifier 
and two resistors for starting. In the reference voltage 
generation circuit, different emitter currents 
flow through the two NPN type bipolar transistors and, 
due to the emitter currents of these transistors, voltage 
drops occur across the two resistors one connected 
between the non-inverting input terminal of the 
differential-input amplifier and a ground potential node 
and one connected between the inverting input terminal 
of the differential-input amplifier and the ground 
potential node. Both the drop voltages are supplied to 
the differential-input amplifier and a voltage on the 
output terminal of the differential-input amplifier is 
applied to the bases of the transistors to provide a 
negative feedback. As a result, a reference voltage of  
 
a predetermined level corresponding to the values of the 
above three resistors, power supply voltage and temperature 
voltage VT (kT/q = 0.0259V) is obtained as an output 
of the differential-input amplifier. Further, when the circuit is incorporated into the 
integrated circuit, an input offset voltage occurs in 
the differential-input amplifier due to some causes, 
such as a variation in the characteristic of elements in 
manufacture. There are, sometimes, the cases where, 
due to the input offset voltage involved, a potential on 
the output terminal stays at a ground level without any 
normal operation at a time of turning a power supply ON. 
With the use of two resistors for starting, therefore, a 
voltage higher than the ground potential is applied to 
the bases of the two transistors upon the turning ON of 
the power supply and, by so doing, a normal operation is 
secured in this case. Further, even during the normal 
operation, a reference voltage of a normal level sometimes 
skips to a ground level due to the intrusion of 
noise, and it is still possible to regain a normal 
operation with the use of such two resistors for 
starting. In
