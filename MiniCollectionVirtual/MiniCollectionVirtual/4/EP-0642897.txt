<ABSTRACT>
A bevel angle indicator for a saw is disclosed. 
The saw 10 consists of a table 16, a pivot support 26 

pivotally mounted with respect to the table 16 about a 
bevel axis 92 and a mechanical saw blade pivotally 

mounted with respect to the pivot support 26 about a 
second axis 28. The pivot support 26 pivots on a pivot 

block 27 attached to the table 16. A gearing mechanism 
couples the pivot block 27 and the pivot support 26 to 

a dial which indicates the angle between the surface of 
the table 16 and the plane of the saw blade. The 

gearing mechanism comprises a rack 50 attached to the 
pivot block 27 and a pinion 54 rotatably journalled in 

the pivot support 26. Adjustment of the bevel angle of 
the saw 10 causes the pinion 54 to advance along the 

rack 50 and therefore rotate relative to the pivot 
support 26. The pinion 54 is attached to a sleeve 52, 

the free end of which carries a pointer 56; the pivot 
support 26 carries a scale 58. The pointer 56 and 

scale 58 indicate with accuracy the current bevel angle 
of the saw.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chop saws and 
particularly to a combination chop and table saw, 
otherwise known as a flip-over saw. In particular, the 
invention relates to such a saw which is capable of 
making bevel cuts in both its table saw mode and mitre 
saw mode. Such a saw is described in US-A-4531441. Combination chop and table saws commonly consist 
of a table, to which is affixed a pivot block, and a 
pivot support pivotable relative to the pivot block 
about a horizontal axis. This horizontal axis is the 
bevel axis of the saw. The pivot support carries the 
saw assembly including the mechanical saw blade. It is 
commonplace for there to be some kind of latch 
arrangement between the pivot block and the pivot 
support, such that the two will latch together at a 
number of commonly used angular positions, for example 
with the saw blade at 15 degrees, 22.5 degrees, 30 
degrees or 45 degrees from the vertical. Such latch 
arrangement is normally provided with a scale which is 
visible from the front of the saw, even though it is at 
the back of the saw from a user's perspective. However, with a saw capable of being used in a 
table mode as well as a chop mode, it is difficult to 
ascertain the bevel angle in the table mode, since the 
pivot block and pivot support are then located 
underneath the table when the table is inverted. 
Although the scale is now at the front of the saw, it 
faces away from the user. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a saw in which it is relatively easy to 
identify the angle which the saw blade makes to the 
vertical. Accordingly, the invention provides a saw 
comprising a workpiece support having a first  
 
substantially planar surface, a pivot support pivotally 
mounted with respect to the workpiece support about a 
first axis, a mechanical saw blade pivotally mounted 
with respect to the pivot support about a second axis, 
the first axis being substantially parallel to the 
surface of the workpiece support and substantially 
coincident with the plane of the saw blade, the second 
axis being substantially perpendicular to the first 
axis and the plane of the saw blade, and a gearing 
mechanism coupling the workpiece support and the pivot 
support to a dial such that the dial indicates the 
angle between the surface of the workpiece support and 
the plane of the saw blade. The bevel angle of the saw 
can easily be identified by inspection of the dial. For ease of construction, it is preferred that the 
gearing mechanism comprise a rack and pinion.

A saw comprising a workpiece support having a 
first substantially planar surface, a pivot support 

pivotally mounted with respect to the workpiece support 
about a first axis, a mechanical saw blade pivotally 

mounted with respect to the pivot support about a 
second axis, the first axis being substantially 

parallel to the surface of the workpiece support and 
substantially coincident with the plane of the saw 

blade, the second axis being substantially 
perpendicular to the first axis and the plane of the 

saw blade, and a gearing mechanism coupling the 
workpiece support and the pivot support to a dial such 

that the dial indicates the angle between the surface 
of the workpiece support and the plane of the saw 

blade. 
A saw according to claim 1, in which the gearing 
mechanism comprises a rack and pinion. 
A saw according to claim 2, in which a pivot block 
affixed to the workpiece support carries the rack and 

the pinion is carried by a spindle rotatably journalled 
in the pivot support. 
A saw according to claim 3, in which the spindle 
is journalled on a pin serving to clamp said pivot 

support and pivot block together. 
A saw according to claim 3 or 4, in which the dial 
comprises a pointer and a scale, one of which is 

attached to the pivot support, the other to one end of 
the spindle. 
A saw according to any preceding claim, in which 
the workpiece support includes a slot to receive the 

 
saw blade and the dial is positioned with respect to 

the pivot support so as to face away from the slot.

frame and adapted to pivot between two positions of the 

table in the frame, a pivot block on one side of the 
table, a pivot support pivotally mounted with respect 

to the table about a first axis coincident with the 
plane of the table, a saw assembly mounted on the pivot 

support and comprising a motor driven saw blade lying 
in a plane coincident with said first axis, a slot in 

the table to one side of said pivot block and pivot 
support, the saw assembly being adapted to move said 

blade in its plane through said slot, and a gearing 
mechanism between said pivot block and pivot support
