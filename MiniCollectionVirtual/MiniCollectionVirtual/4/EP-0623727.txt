<ABSTRACT>
Method for covering the facades of building with 
glass panels. Said panels (1) consist of a pane of glass 

(101) and a frame of metal sections (105), which frame 
possesses, on the side nearest the glass pane (101), a 

ceramic-coated or glazed metal insert, the glass pane 
(101) being joined to said insert by means of a strip of 

suitable mastic (3), for example structural silicone. The 
resulting composite panel (1) is secured to the 

supporting structure (5) of the building facade by the 
mechanical fixing of the edges (205) of the frame to a 

section (6) belonging to said supporting structure (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the covering of the 
facades of buildings with glass panels and a method of 
fixing these panels to the supporting structures of the 
facade of the building. In European Patent no. (European Patent Application 
no. 90123292.6) by the present proprietor, a method 
is described for fixing double glazing panels to the 
supporting structures of a building. According to this 
method two panes of glass are first joined together by 
means of silicon-based mastic applied to their opposing 
sides at a certain distance from their peripheral edge 
with a distance piece being inserted between said two 
glass panes, the resulting composite panel being secured 
to the supporting structure of the building facade by the 
mechanical fixing of the peripheral edges of the inner-most 
pane of each panel to a generally C-shaped section 
with a suitable rubber or similar seal in between. This application has undoubted advantages. In its 
practical embodiment, however, it has also thrown up some 
drawbacks and disadvantages which it is part of the 
object of the present invention to eliminate. Thus it is known that in buildings of modern 
design with glass-covered facades, only around 50 % of 
the external surface of the building is actually windows, 
the remainder of the surface being formed by "blind" surfaces, 
that is load-bearing walls, partitions, parapets 
and so on. The system according to the patent cited above 
is perfectly effective in the case of windows, but the 
same cannot be said for the second case. This is because 
double glazing installed a short distance back from a 
wall or other structure tends to accumulate large amounts 
of heat in the hollow space between the two. This heat 
can cause damage to the structure of the panel in the 
form of deterioration in the mastic or in the innermost 
pane itself. To solve this problem use is often made of 
toughened and therefore more heat-resistant glass which 
in extreme cases shatters into small pieces rather than 
large splinters. In this particular case, the breakage is  
 
not a major problem in itself but rather in that the 
innermost pane represents the load-bearing structure of 
the panel and if its support is lost the danger is that 
the outermost pane can come loose and fall out. The chief object of the present invention is 
therefore to provide a system that will solve the aforementioned 
problems without significantly affecting the 
structure of the panel and its fixing system as described 
in the previous European patent

Method for covering the facades of buildings with 
glass panels in which said panels (1) consist of a pane 

of glass (101) and a supporting element (105) which 
anchors said pane to the supporting structure forming 

part of the framework of the building, the method being 
characterised in that said supporting and anchoring 

element (105) is a frame of metal sections whose peripheral 
dimensions are smaller than those of the glass 

pane (101) and in that said glass pane (101) is joined 
to it by means of a strip of mastic (3) applied to the 

two opposing sides of the glass pane (101) and of the 
section (105) at a certain distance (d) from the peripheral 

edge (205) of the section (105), the resulting 
composite panel (1) being secured to the supporting 

structure (5) of the building facade by the mechanical 
fixing of the peripheral edges (205) of the frame of each 

panel (1) to a section (6) belonging to said supporting 
structure (5). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that said frame of metal sections (105) is generally L-shaped 

in cross section, comprising a hollow peripheral 
flange (205) of the same thickness as the glass pane 

(102), which is inserted into the section (6) belonging 
to the supporting structure (5) of the building facade 

and a thicker hollow part (305) whose face nearest the 
glass pane (101) is ceramic-coated or glazed. 
Method according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that said ceramic coating or glazing of said face of 

the hollow part (305) of said frame of metal sections 
(105) is achieved by attaching a ceramic-coated or glazed 

metal strip (106) to said face. 
Method according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that said ceramic-coated or glazed metal strip (106) 

is attached by inserting it in a slot (9) of open C cross 
section on said hollow part (305). 
Method according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that from the arm of the C of said slot (9) there 

 
projects towards the centre of the frame a flange (107) 

and between this flange (107) and the glass pane (101) is 
a bi-adhesive seal (10) or a layer of mastic. 
Method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said frame of metal sections 

(105) is of aluminium or some other light metal or 
alloy. 
Method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said mastic (3) is structural 

silicone. 
Method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said ceramic-coated or 

glazed metal strip (106) is a steel strip glazed on both 
faces. 
Method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said section (6) belonging 

to the supporting structure is a generally C-shaped 
section and in that said edges (205) of said panels are 

accommodated in said section (6). 
Method according to Claim 9, characterised in 
that said edges (205) of said panels (1) are inserted 

into said C sections (6) with a suitable seal (7) of 
rubber or rubber-like material between the two. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
comprising a further step of forming a seal between the 

peripheral edge of said outermost glass pane (101) of 
said panels (1) and the nearest side of said C section 

(6) by means of a suitable mastic (8). 
Glass panel for the covering of the facades of 
buildings, produced by the method described in Claims 1 

to 11.
