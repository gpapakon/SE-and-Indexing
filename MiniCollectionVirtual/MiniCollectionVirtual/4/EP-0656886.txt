<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to retroviral 
protease inhibitors and, more particularly, relates to 
novel compounds and a composition and method for 
inhibiting retroviral proteases. This invention, in 
particular, relates to sulfonamide-containing 
hydroxyethylamine protease inhibitor compounds, a 
composition and method for inhibiting retroviral proteases 
such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease and 
for treating a retroviral infection, e.g., an HIV 
infection. The subject invention also relates to 
processes for making such compounds as well as to 
intermediates useful in such processes. During the replication cycle of retroviruses, 
gag and gag-pol gene products are translated as proteins. 
These proteins are subsequently processed by a virally 
encoded protease (or proteinase) to yield viral enzymes 
and structural proteins of the virus core. Most commonly, 
the gag precursor proteins are processed into the core 
proteins and the pol precursor proteins are processed into 
the viral enzymes, e.g., reverse transcriptase and 
retroviral protease. It has been shown that correct 
processing of the precursor proteins by the retroviral 
protease is necessary for assembly of infectious virons. 
For example, it has been shown that frameshift mutations 
in the protease region of the pol gene of HIV prevents 
processing of the gag precursor protein. It has also been 
shown through site-directed mutagenesis of an aspartic 
acid residue in the HIV protease that processing of the 
gag precursor protein is prevented. Thus, attempts have 
been made to inhibit viral replication by inhibiting the 
action of retroviral proteases.  
 Retroviral protease inhibition may involve a 
transition-state mimetic whereby the retroviral protease 
is exposed to a mimetic compound which binds to the enzyme 
in competition with the gag and gag-pol proteins to 
thereby inhibit replication of structural proteins and, 
more importantly, the retroviral protease itself. In this 
manner, retroviral replication proteases can be 
effectively inhibited. Several classes of compounds have been proposed, 
particularly for inhibition of proteases, such as for 
inhibition of HIV protease. Such compounds include 
hydroxyethylamine isosteres and reduced amide isosteres. 
See, for example, EP 0 346 847; EP 0 342,541; Roberts et 
al, "Rational Design of Peptide-Based Proteinase 
Inhibitors, "Science, 248, 358 (1990); and Erickson et 
al, "Design Activity, and 2.8A Crystal Structure of a C2 
Symmetric Inhibitor Complexed to HIV-1
