<ABSTRACT>
Feature points data and quality grade data of fingerprint 
images are stored in a data base with register number of each 

fingerprint as an index for access. A verification method 
dictionary contains different verification methods for different 

quality grades. A verifier unit refers to the verification method 
dictionary to select a verification method adapted for the quality 

grade of a fingerprint to be compared.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for fingerprint
verification, and more particularly to a fingerprint verification
apparatus for individual person identification, for example, in an
access control.Fingerprints have been playing important roles in person
identification, due to their important characteristics of unchangeability
and uniqueness. Recently, an automatic fingerprint
verification apparatus has been developed using pattern recognition
technique by a computer. In the automatic apparatus, feature points
in a fingerprint are detected, the feature points being, for
example, end points which are terminal points of a ridge line, or
bifurcation points which are points where two ridge lines meet.Accurate extraction of feature points and careful comparison
of feature points data are necessary for improving the reliability
of verification. Fingerprint images are often smudged and unclear,
and it will take a fairly long time to extract feature points
accurately from these unclear fingerprint images.Various proposals have been made for obtaining reliable result
of verification in a reduced processing time.
In JBM TDB vol. 17, no. 12, May 1975, New York "Fingerprint
Based Person Verification System" verification is improved by
repeated correlation measurements dependent on a threshold.
When fingerprint
verification is used for access control, a fingerprint which is
referred in a comparison is previously registered in a data base.
A fingerprint to be verified is input through a same fingerprint
image input unit through which the fingerprint in the data base is
input. Although the same fingerprint image input unit is used for
all the fingerprints to be verified, there are a wide variety in 
quality grade in the input images. This variety of quality grade of
images seems to be inherent to surface conditions of a finger, and
the quality grade of a fingerprint will not change for changed
instances of input.There have been proposals to use this quality grade of images
for verification of a fingerprint.
JP-A-150781/'88 discloses an apparatus for measuring resolution of
a fingerprint image, and storing the measured value of resolution
in the data base. When data of a fingerprint are read out for a
reference of comparison from the data base, the resolution is also
read out, and the scanning rate of a fingerprint image under
verification is determined in accordance with the value of
resolution, thus avoiding unnecessary fine scanning for an image
having a low grade resolution.JP-A-127192/'91 discloses a method
