<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing iron and manganese from solutions 
of zinc chloride containing hydrochloric acid, having a zinc 

ion concentration between 50 and 500 gm/l, an iron ions 
concentration between 1 and 70 gm/l, and a manganese 

concentration between 10 and 200 ppm, comprising a 
neutralization of free acid; a first oxidation step of 

ferrous ions to ferric ones by means of a first oxidizing 
agent selected in the group consisting of sodium chlorate, 

hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, sodium chlorite; and 
an iron precipitation as a compound with formula (1)



Fe₂O₃ · Fe(OH)₃   (1)



 
in the form of easily filterable crystalline particles. 

After the beginning of the crystallization a second 
oxidizing agent formed by potassium permanganate is added, 

so that manganese is precipited as MnO₂; then the compound 
with formula (1) and MnO₂ are removed together by filtering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for removing iron 
and manganese from acid solutions of zinc salts. Generally 
the field of the present invention regards polluted 
solutions obtained in galvanizing plants, in pickling iron 
or badly plated parts before zinc-plating. Particularly the 
invention relates to a solution containing hydrochloric acid 
that has a zinc ion concentration between 50 and 500 g/l, 
preferably between 150 and 400 g/l, and an iron ions 
concentration between 1 and 70 g/l, and a manganese 
concentration between 10 and 200 ppm, preferably between 50 
and 150 ppm. Since zinc solutions containing iron ions, usually ferrous 
ions, and other impurities, can hardly be recycled to other 
purposes, their treatment is often very expensive. On the contrary it is common knowledge that ironless and 
manganeseless zinc solutions may be easily employed again 
in other industrial operations, sometimes in the plating 
plants themselves, and the iron removed from zinc may be 
recycled to other purposes. Furthermore zinc solutions free from iron, manganese and 
heavy metals can be used in more interesting industrial 
processes with stricter requirements. This is particularly 
important because in this way the whole process can be 
remunerative. It is common knowledge that neutralization of iron  
 
solutions, e.g. with sodium hydroxide, involves 
precipitations of iron hydroxide, which is very difficult to 
filter; moreover, increasing pH-value to about 6, also zinc 
precipitates together with iron as Zn(OH)2. It is also known that the ferrous ions may be oxidized to 
ferric ions, so that iron precipitates as Fe(OH)3. However 
applicant found that Fe(OH)3 gives rise to a colloidal 
precipitate and its filtration is difficult to perform, for 
the Fe(OH)3 slime obstructs filters; consequently filtration 
time is prolonged beyond any industrial benefit. Moreover, 
the obtained slimes are very gelatinous and retain mother 
liquor in plenty (they have a high titre of zinc, for 
instance about 30%). US Patent No. 4 591 489 and French Patent No. 2 307 880 
disclose processes for removing iron from zinc and iron 
solutions. According to these processes, an organic layer 
and a distinct aqueous one are used. Many additional plant 
and maintenance costs, which generally are exorbitant 
compared with the low value of these solutions, are involved 
if an organic layer is employed. US Patent No. 3 600 128 dicloses a removal process based on 
the use of activated carbon. The carbon increases the 
filtering
