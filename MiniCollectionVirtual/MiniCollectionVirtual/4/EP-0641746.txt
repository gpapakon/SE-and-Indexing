<ABSTRACT>
The interlayer adhesion and final strength of cementitious compositions which are applied 
in consecutive layers are im
proved by the incorporation in the compositions of an 
admixture which is a combination of a waterproofing agent and a water retention agent. 

The invention is particularly applicable to sprayed concrete.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cementitious compositions, more particularly to cementitious
compositions for application to substrates in consecutive layers, and most particularly to those
which are applied by spraying, and to admixtures for use therein.It is often required that a cementitious composition be applied in consecutive layers. The best
known of such applications is the spraying of cementitious compositions such as "shotcrete",
wherein a number of individual layers is applied by means of a shotcreting gun. One of the
problems frequently encountered in such applications is cracking and shrinkage of the
composition and bonding failures at the layer interfaces. The solution to this problem has
hitherto been the application to the sprayed composition of a curing agent, that is, a
preparation which is sprayed on the surface and which forms a film thereon. Typical
examples include hydrocarbons, fatty acid salts and emulsions of paraffins or microwaxes.
Because of the water loss at the surface of sprayed cementitious compositions, this must be
done within a very short time of spraying - usually within 15-20 minutes. Moreover, before a
further layer can be added, the curing agent must be removed, otherwise it may prevent
adequate bonding between adjacent layers of sprayed composition. Various relatively easily-removable
curing agents have been made and marketed, but they still involve the time-consuming
work of application and renewal.It has now been discovered that certain admixtures can be added to cementitious compositions
prior to layer application and that these compositions not only remove the necessity for the
application and removal of curing agents, but they may also confer considerable property
advantages on the compositions. The invention therefore provides a method of applying a
cementitious composition in consecutive layers, comprising adding to the composition a
curing admixture, which comprises at least one concrete waterproofing agent and at least one
water retention agent.The invention further provides a method for the application of a cementitious composition
comprising the preparation of a concrete mix and its placement in consecutive layers,
characterized in that the composition comprises an admixture as hereinabove described. A combination of a waterproofing agent and a water-entraining agent is already known to the
art, in Japanese Kokai H02-263,751, in connection with tile grouts. There is no mention in this
document that any other use is possible.By "concrete waterproofing agent"
