<ABSTRACT>
Flat pack rechargeable batteries which include 
internal support members (29, 47) are disclosed. In the 

most preferred form of the invention, an intermediate 
support (40) extender plate is provided. The plate also 

includes holes (43) to maintain a common path for 
electrolyte.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the art 
of rechargeable batteries and more particularly to the 
support of battery elements within a cell casing. Still 
more specifically, the present invention relates to a 
device for insuring structural integrity in thicker cells 
while maintaining a common path for electrolyte flow. Small rechargeable batteries are becoming 
increasingly important with the continuing development of 
portable electronic appliances, such as uninterruptible 
power systems (UPS). The batteries which are used with 
such devices are frequently referred to as flat pack 
batteries. It is highly desirable that such batteries be 
compact and light in weight yet have a high storage 
capacity. Advances have been made in this technology in recent 
years, even using conventional lead-acid battery 
technology. Lead-acid batteries typically suffer from 
weight disadvantages due to the weight of the plate 
materials (lead plates and lead-containing active 
materials) and the weight of the containers which are 
required to hold the plates and electrolyte. Lead-acid 
batteries, however, have very good power delivery 
characteristics and may be repeatedly recharged and even 
overcharged, with only minimal damage to the cells.  
 
Moreover, the power curve of lead-acid batteries is 
relatively predictable. Such features are not readily 
achievable with other batteries, such as nickel cadmium 
batteries. One type of lead-acid battery is the recombinant 
battery which differs from conventional lead-acid 
batteries (for example, automobile batteries) in that 
there is no flowing electrolyte in the system. 
Substantially all of the electrolyte is maintained in 
separator material, typically made of a glass fiber mat, 
located between the plates. The gasses evolved during 
the electrochemical reactions which take place in lead-acid 
batteries are absorbed and recombined within the 
battery rather than being vented in the normal case. 
With such systems, the battery can be sealed and made 
maintenance free. Other recombinant systems still use 
valves to relieve any undesirable build-up of pressure 
within the cells of the battery. One recent development in the field of recombinant 
lead-acid batteries is described in United States Patent 
No. 4,996,128 issued December 26, 1991 to Aldecoa and 
Miller entitled "Rechargeable Battery" (hereafter, the 
"'128 patent"). The battery described in this patent 
includes a thin plastic casing having generally 
rectangular top and bottom portions, the casing

<CLAIMS>
A rechargeable lead-acid battery of the type 
comprising upper and lower casings (
10, 20), a plurality 
of support members (29) attached to one of the casings 

and extending toward the other casing, the support 
members including an upper end (31), and characterized by 

a non-conductive plate (40) located between the casings 
(10, 20), openings (43) being provided in the plate and 

support members (47) attached to the intermediate plate 
(40) and extending perpendicularly therefrom and having 

upper ends, the casing support members (29) bridging the 
casing member and the plate (40) and being attached to 

the plate, and the support members (47) extending from 
the plate bridging the plate and the other casing (10) 

and being attached thereto, the battery being further 
characterized by electrode elements disposed on either 

side of the plate.

formed from a thermoplastic, moldable resin and wherein 
the support members (29, 47) are formed integrally 

therewith. 
The battery of Claim 1 further characterized in 
that sockets (15) are provided in the other casing and 

arranged to receive the upper ends of the support members 
(47) extending from the plate. 
The battery of Claim 1 further characterized in 
that sockets (45) are provided on the plate (40) on the 

side thereof opposite the side from which its support
