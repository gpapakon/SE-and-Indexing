<ABSTRACT>
An optical apparatus or a control device to be 
used for a light flux deflecting apparatus is arranged to 

include at least two light flux deflecting portions (4a,4b) and a 
control portion (5-7) which control the driving actions of the 

at least two light flux deflecting portions in such a 
manner that, with the light flux deflecting portions 

applied as image shake preventing mechanisms to an optical 
apparatus using a plurality of light fluxes, such as a 

binocular, the arrangement effectively prevents such 
inconveniences as the necessity of using a plurality of 

control portions in controlling each of the light flux 
deflecting portions and giving a disagreeable feeling to 

the user due to a discrepancy arising in the amount of 
deflection between two light fluxes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical apparatus
having a function of preventing an image shake by
optically correcting the image shake.Image shake correcting devices heretofore used
for optical apparatuses such as binoculars, etc., include,
among others, (i) a product of Carl Zeiss Stiftung wherein
an inertia force is used for a shake detecting system,
which is coupled with a shake correcting system consisting
of an optical lens through a special supporting mechanism
called a cardan shaft, and the shake is attenuated in a
passive manner; and (ii) a product of FUJI SYASHIN KOKI
Co. wherein a free gyro which is arranged to rotate at a
high speed is used for a shake detecting system, the free
gyro is coupled, into one body, with a shake correcting
system consisting of two right and left prisms, and the
shake is stabilized through an external gimbal.Other optical image shake correcting devices
which are adapted for apparatuses other than binoculars
include, for example, an image shake correcting device
wherein a miniature acceleration sensor is used for a
shake detecting system, a variable angle prism which is a
sort of liquid prism is used for a shake correction
system, a shake correction amount is computed and obtained
by a microcomputer from information on the result of shake 
detection, an optical axis is forcibly refracted to a
direction opposite to the direction of the shake by
deforming the variable angle prism, in such a way as to
stabilize the image forming point of the apparatus. The
image shake correcting devices of this kind have already
been actually applied to video cameras.Fig. 48 shows the basic control arrangement of
