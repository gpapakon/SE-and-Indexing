<ABSTRACT>
Novel anti-inflammatory compounds, compositions of these compounds and use of such compounds to treat inflammed ocular tissue are described. The compounds are derivatives and analogues of known steroid compounds (e.g., dexamethasone) and are advantageously characterized in that they do not cause any significant increase in intraocular pressure during chronic use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel derivatives of
known anti-inflammatory steroids, processes useful for their
preparation, and use of these novel derivatives in the
treatment of ophthalmic inflammatory disorders. More
particularly, this invention relates to the treatment of
ophthalmic inflammatory disorders with novel derivatives of
known anti-inflammatory steroids, wherein the novel
derivatives do not cause any significant increase in
intraocular pressure.Anti-inflammatory steroids, such as hydrocortisone,
prednisolone, dexamethasone, and fluorometholone, are very
useful in controlling a wide range of ophthalmic inflammatory
conditions. This usefulness may be somewhat negated due to a
steroid-induced side effect associated with the chronic use of
these compounds. This side effect may be manifested by a rise
in intraocular pressure (IOP) in steroid-sensitive patients
(steroid-responders), an increase in IOP in glaucoma sensitive
patients, or an exacerbation of IOP in patients suffering from
frank primary open angle glaucoma. Further discussion of this
side effect is presented in an article by Phillips, et al.,
The Lancet, 767-768 (April 7, 1984).The above-described manifestations can generally be
tolerated in most patients over a relatively short treatment
period (i.e., four to six weeks, or less); however, the
increase in IOP caused by these compounds is generally
unacceptable over extended periods of treatment (i.e., one to
twelve months, or more), especially in individuals subject to
chronic eye inflammation. The increased intraocular pressure
associated with the short term use of these compounds may also
be unacceptable in certain patients, such as patients already
suffering from an elevated IOP (e.g., glaucoma patients). A 
need therefore exists for an effective means of treating
inflamed ocular tissue without risk of elevating IOP. The
present invention is directed to satisfying this need.EP-A 320 253, Chem. Abstr. 113, 132583d (1990) and Chem.
Pharm. Bull. 38 (3), 786 (1990) disclose some steroidal
compounds having anti-inflammatory activity. None of these
documents is directed to ophthalmic compositions. JCS Perkin I
2306 (1981) discloses 16α,17α,21-trimethyl steroids possessing
anti-inflammatory activity. One side product of certain
16α,17α,21-trimethyl steroids is reported to be a steroidal
21-methylether. This document does not disclose any ophthalmic
compositions either.The present invention is directed to novel steroidal C21
ether derivatives, ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions
