homology with the sequence mentioned above, said process being 
carried out according to methods described in claim 18. 
Process for preparing nucleotide sequences as defined 
in one of claims 18 to 25, labelled, in particular in a 

radioactive, enzymatic manner, by a fluorescent compound, by 
linkage to an antigenic molecule (capable of being recognised by 

the antibodies) or any other molecule capable of being directly 
or indirectly detected using reagents, this linkage being able 

to be carried out by means of a spacer arm, in particular by 
means of a nucleotide sequence constituted by about 5 to 100 

nucleotides situated at the 3' or 5' ends of these sequences, 
said process being carried out according to methods described in 

claim 18. 
Process for preparing a kit for the implementation of 
a procedure according to one of claims 11 to 13, said process 

comprising the step consisting in gathering : 

at least one pair of primers according to claim 22, and/or 
at least one pair of primers according to claim 23, 
one (or more) probe(s) according to claim 24, and/or one 
(or more) probe(s) according to claim 25, said probes being 

capable of hybridizing with all or part of the gene fragment 
amplified by means of the primer pairs according to claims 22 and  

 
23 respectively. 
Process for preparing a kit according to claim 27, said 
process comprising also the step consisting in gathering : 


a thermoresistant DNA or RNA polymerase, 
a reaction medium advantageously constituted by Tris-HCl 
10 mM pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl
2
, 0.01% gelatine, co-factors 
of DNA polymerase, notably Mg
2+
 and K
+
 ions, and the 4 
constitutive deoxynucleotides of DNA (dCTP, dATP, dGTP, dTTP) or 

RNA (dCTP, dATP, dGTP, dUTP) and/or,
 
   one or more restriction enzymes, and, if appropriate, the 

reference restriction fragments characteristic of the subspecies 
of 
Erwinia carotovora
 and/or 
Erwinia chrysanthemi,
 in particular 
the restriction fragments represented in Figure 3, in the case 

of the subspecies of 
Erwinia carotovora
 and/or, 
a ligase and one (or more) pair(s) of oligonucleotide 
sequences, capable of hybridizing on either side of one (or more) 

nucleotide(s) situated in the genes or gene fragments coding 
pectate-lyases, and being characteristic of a species, subspecies 

or pathovar of 
Erwinia,
 and/or 
one (or more) oligonucleotide probe(s) specific to one 
nucleotide region characteristic of a determined species, 

subspecies or pathovar of bacteria of the 
Erwinia
 genus.
