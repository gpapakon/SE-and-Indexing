<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel photographic
silver halide materials containing certain dye-forming
photographic couplers, to processes using such
materials, and to the couplers themselves and the dyes
formed thereby.Color images are customarily obtained in the
photographic art by reaction between an oxidation
product of a silver halide developing agent and a
dye-forming coupler. The dyes formed from the couplers
generally have a main absorption in the red, green or
blue regions of the visible spectrum. Couplers which
form cyan, magenta, and yellow dyes dyes upon reaction
with oxidized color developing agents are well known.
Such couplers typically include a ballast group
attached to the coupler nucleus. Generally, a ballast
group is an organic radical of such size and
configuration as to confer on the coupler molecule
sufficient bulk to render the coupler substantially
non-diffusible from the layer in which it is coated in
a photographic element.While such dye-forming couplers are useful in
photographic silver halide materials and processes,
many of such couplers do not have sufficient coupler
reactivity.The present invention provides novel couplers
exhibiting increased coupler reactivity, improved
contrast and improved development speed. Additionally,
the couplers provide maximum dye density, and exhibit
satisfactory solubility, dispersability and
bathochromic hue.The couplers according to the present invention
are represented by formula (I): 

wherein:
n is 1 or 2;R2 represents hydrogen or a substituent;R and R1 independently represent a substituent;L is selected from the group consisting of O, S,
Se, Te, Si(R5)2, NR5, PR5, P(O)(R5)2 and NR5SO2, wherein R5
represents hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl
or substituted or unsubstituted aryl; andK is a coupler moiety based on pyrazolone, phenol,
naphthol or enamine, to which the ballast group is
attached.Preferred couplers are represented by formula
(II):

wherein:
n, R2, R1 and K are as previously defined;m is from 0 to 5; andeach Ra is independently a substituent.An embodiment of the invention is a photographic
element comprising a support bearing at least one
photographic silver halide emulsion layer and a
dye-forming coupler of formula (I) or (II).While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is
believed that the ballast group, containing a
combination of the sulfone or sulfoxide group and the L
linkage attaching the substituent R group to the
tertiary carbon atom, contributes to the desired
improved properties of the couplers. Particularly
