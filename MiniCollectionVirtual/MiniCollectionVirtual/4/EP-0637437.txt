<ABSTRACT>
A composite surgical spinal fixation system including a bone bolt 
(11) having end portions (12) that are adapted to be surgically 

implanted into a patient's spine at first and second spaced apart 
positions and a central portion of the bone bolt defining a load 

transfer surface, the bone bolt having a second upper threaded section 
(14) for threadably receiving a nut (16) at a shaped, countersunk 

interface (42). As an alternate embodiment, a bone screw provides an 
upper enlarged head (46) with a lower coarsely threaded shank (44). A 

composite plate (17) having upper and lower surfaces and outer opposed 
edges is provided with an elongated slot (20) for accommodating a 

selected bone bolt or bone screw. The plate edges carry fine adjustments 
(27,28) extending between the upper and lower surfaces of the plate and 

a load transfer washer (35) interfaces the plate and the selected bone 
bolt or bone bolt (or screw) to the plate. The composite plate adopts a 

curved configuration via asymmetric ply lamination or by melt-forming. 
The curvature of the plate is dictated by the natural lordotic curvature 

of the patient's spine. The plate is comprised of either a plurality of 
laminal arranged in a specific ply sequence or a plurality of fibers or 

tows arranged through winding and/or placement. Electrochemical 
compatibility with the composite plate is ensured by careful selection 

of the materials comprising the attachment means and the washer 

mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surgical systems and more 
particularly relates to an improved composite spinal plate apparatus 
in the form of a strong and stable construct for maximum fusion 
augmentation with improved versatility and ease of use, and 
wherein a washer forms a load transfer interface with the composite 
plate and one or more adjacent non-metallic (eg. ceramic or 
composite), or metallic fixation screws. A countersunk interface 
provides some micro-motion, better stress distribution and thus 
enhanced fatigue life. There are a number of surgical procedures which require a 
fixation of portions of the spine with respect to one another. 
Frequently, bone screws are employed in the fixation of the spine. 
The implantation of bone screws is a surgical procedure which 
involves the formation of one or more surgical openings in adjacent 
portions of the spine, with threaded bone screws being implanted 
into these surgical openings. Connective structures such as rods or 
plates extend between the various spine members by connecting 
the adjacent bone screws. An early spinal fixation system can be seen in the Lumb et al 
patent 3,648,691 entitled "Method of Applying Vertebral Appliance". 
In the Lumb patent, a method of applying a vertebral appliance for 
use in bridging one or more diseased or damaged vertebrae uses a 
pair of elongated flexible multiple aperture plates having fasteners 
which are used to clamp the plate to opposite sides of the spinous 
processes being spanned. Each strap or plate is of a length 
adapted to span at least two spinous processes and project beyond 
each end so that the fasteners can be passed both behind and in 
front thereof as well as through the interspinous gap there between. 
The apertures are located considerably closer together than 
adjacent processes and they are fastened to the latter in position 
such that at least one opening registers with each one to receive a 
growth or soft bony tissue that eventually extrudes therein.  A polymer composite that was evaluated for use an 
orthopaedic, variable screw placement (VSP) spinal plate is 
disclosed in a 1989 article entitled "Accelerated Testing of A 
Composite Spine Plate". It was felt by the authors that fretting 
fatigue or cyclic loading that causes micromotion at interfaces in the 
spine plate could cause significant wear of the composite plate. 
Therefore, a test method was developed to assess a continuous 
carbon fibre polysulphone composite plate in in vitro fretting fatigue.
