<ABSTRACT>
The invention can be utilised for the machining of horizontally arranged layers (2), an interposed layer (2) which can become embrittled and cannot be age-hardened being arranged between two adjacent layers (2) having roughly the same material parameters. The invention is intended to guarantee that no penetration or only slight penetration of chip material into the marginal zone of the interposed layer (2) is effected during the machining process and no burr or only a small amount of burr forms at the marginal zone of the recess during the tool exit. A defined recess is guaranteed. The material parameters of the interposed layer (2) which are present at the end are achieved without impairment. Environmental pollution is eliminated to the greatest possible extent. Layers (2), which are arranged horizontally one above the other in a plate or strip shape and form a stack, are mechanically arranged by a cutting tool (4) at a predetermined location for cutting off material particles of the layers (2) and are machined for the purpose of making a defined recess. During a positioning action of the tool (4), pre-cooling of the layers (2) with a suitable coolant is effected at the same time, in the course of which the layers are pre-cooled intensively at least in a certain area of the stack. After completion of the positioning action and the pre-cooling, the machining process is realised at a high cutting speed while coolant continues to be fed to the machining location. During the machining process, continuous extraction of the cut-off material particles and the coolant is effected at the machining location together with the drawing of external air into the machining space. The embrittlement of the material arranged as an intermediate layer is neutralized after the machining process is complete.
