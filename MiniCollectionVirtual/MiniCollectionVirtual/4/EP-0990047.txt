<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to methods and compositions for
analyzing nucleic acid molecules, and more specifically to tags which may be utilized in
a wide variety of nucleic acid reactions, wherein separation of nucleic acid molecules
based on size is required.Detection and analysis of nucleic acid molecules are among the most
important techniques in biology. Such techniques are at the heart of molecular biology
and play a rapidly expanding role in the rest of biology.Generally, one type of analysis of nucleic acid reactions involves
separation of nucleic acid molecules based on length. For example, one widely used
technique, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (see, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195,
4,683,202, and 4,800,159) has become a widely utilized technique to both identify
sequences present in a sample and to synthesize DNA molecules for further
manipulation.Briefly, in PCR, DNA sequences are amplified by enzymatic reaction
that synthesizes new DNA strands in either a geometric or linear fashion. Following
amplification, the DNA sequences must be detected and identified. Because of non-specific
amplifications, which would otherwise confuse analysis, or the need for purity,
the PCR reaction products are generally subjected to separation prior to detection.
Separation based on the size (i.e.. length) of the products yields the most useful
information. The method giving the highest resolution of nucleic acid molecules is
electrophoretic separation. In this method, each individual PCR reaction is applied to
an appropriate gel and subjected to a voltage potential. The number of samples that can
be processed is limited by the number of wells in the gel. On most gel apparatus, from
approximately 10 to 64 samples can be separated in a single gel. Thus. processing large
numbers of samples is both labor and material intensive.Electrophoretic separation must be coupled with some detection system
in order to obtain data. Detection systems of nucleic acids commonly, and almost
exclusively, utilize an intercalating dye or radioactive label, and less frequently, a nonradioactive
label. Intercalating dyes, such as ethidium bromide, are simple to use. The
dye is included in the gel matrix during electrophoresis or, following electrophoresis,
the gel is soaked in a dye-containing solution. The dye can be directly visualized in 
some cases, but more often, and for ethidium bromide in particular, is excited by light
(e.g., UV) to fluoresce. In spite of this apparent ease of use, such dyes have some
notable
