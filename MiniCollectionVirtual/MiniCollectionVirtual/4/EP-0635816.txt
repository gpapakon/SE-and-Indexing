<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system including a dynamic random
access memory.With the cost per bit of a semiconductor memory and the price
of computer systems dropping, personal work stations and
other computer systems using graphics such as CAD/CAM systems
are becoming more readily availabe. A crucial component in
such systems is the dynamic video RAM which supports the
graphics applications.Conventional dynamic video RAMs, available on multichips,
have a random port and a serial port enabling a computer to
access the dynamic video RAM through the random port and
enabling the serial port to deliver the necessary graphics
information to drive, for example, a color monitor. In designing dynamic video RAMs, several features are of
critical importance.First, it is important to package the (video) RAM on a single
integrated circuit chip minimizing the number of external
pins of the chip. Secondly, it is important to maximize the
memory contained on the chip. Third, it is important to
perform as many of the modification operations on chip to
increase the speed, rather than having off chip hardware
perform these operations at a much slower rate off the chip.
Fourth, it is important to maximize ,the addressing
capabilities of the data stored within the chip. The number
of clock inputs controlling the random port of the video RAM
leads to complexity and slower speed.The following patents are representative of
issued patents involving dynamic RAMs commercially
available. In each of these patents, no provision is
made for incorporating both the conventional image mode
addressing and the vector mode addressing of the
present invention onto the chip carrying the RAM. The
conventional -image mode addressing is slow when a
vertical line in the screen is to be modified. Each
scan line in memory must be addressed even though each
scan line contains only one pixel in the vertical line
to be modified. Hence, a substantial number of scan
lines in memory must be addressed to modify the line.
Under the teachings of the present invention, the
vertical line can be addressed as a vertical vector in
a page and, therefore, only those vertical vectors
comprising the vertical line need to be addressed.
This substantially speeds up the addressing for
vertical lines in the dynamic video RAM. In each of these patents, further, no
provision is made for incorporating the drawing or
replacement rules onto the chip carrying the RAM.
Rather, in order to modify a given line of information
stored in the RAM, the information to be modified
