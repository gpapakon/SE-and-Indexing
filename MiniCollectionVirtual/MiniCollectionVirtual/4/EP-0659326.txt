<ABSTRACT>
A mobile station can be connected to more than one base station in a procedure known as macro-diversity. In order to synchronize the signals for a specific cellular call connection, the time difference between the connected base station's signal and a macro-diversity candidate base station's signal is measured by a mobile station. This measurement is then transmitted to the network. The measurements can be used to achieve synchronization by means of frame staggering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA) communications techniques in cellular
radio telephone communication systems, and more particularly,
to a method using a Direct Sequence-Code Division Multiple
Access (DS-CDMA) communication technique for aligning
transmissions in macro-diversity down-links from more than
one base station to the same mobile station.CDMA or spread spectrum communications have been in existence
since the days of World War II. Early applications were
predominantly military oriented. However, today there has
been an increasing interest in using spread spectrum systems
in commercial applications. Some examples include digital
cellular radio, land mobile radio, and indoor and outdoor
personal communication networks, generically referred to as
cellular systems herein.Currently, channel access in cellular systems is achieved
using Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) methods. In FDMA, a communication
channel is a single radio frequency band into which
a signal's transmission power is concentrated. Interference
with adjacent channels is limited by the use of band pass
filters which only pass signal energy within the specified
frequency band. Thus, with each channel being assigned a
different frequency, system capacity is limited by the
available frequencies as well as by limitations imposed by
channel reuse. In TDMA systems, a channel consists of a time slot in a
periodic train of time intervals over the same frequency.
Each period of time slots is called a frame. A given
signal's energy is confined to one of these time slots.
Adjacent channel interference is limited by the use of a time
gate or other synchronization element that only passes signal
energy received at the proper time. Thus, the problem of
interference from different relative signal strength levels
is reduced. With FDMA or TDMA systems or hybrid FDMA/TDMA
systems, the goal is to insure that two potentially interfering
signals do not occupy the same frequency at the same
time.Capacity in a TDMA system is increased by compressing the
transmission signal into a shorter time slot. As a result,
the information must be transmitted at a correspondingly
faster burst rate which increases the amount of occupied
spectrum proportionally.In present systems, such as GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communication) , time-alignment of mobile stations in an up-link
is used to ensure that a base station receives the
signal from a mobile station in the assigned
