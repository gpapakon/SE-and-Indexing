<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the removal of
organic contaminants, especially oily contaminants, from solid
particulate material and more particularly to a method for the
removal of oil from cuttings obtained from drilling operations using
oil-based drilling muds.Drilling muds are used to carry rock cuttings out of the
wellbore and to the surface. Both water-based and oil-based muds
are used as drilling muds. Water-based muds are generally cheaper
and less toxic than those based on oil but the latter possess many
operational advantages, particularly for the drilling of high angle,
long reach and high pressure/high temperature wells.However conventional oil based muds (OBM's) also suffer from a
number of undesirable characteristics. In particular oil may be
retained on the drill cuttings resulting in adverse environmental
considerations.It is very important therefore that any oil retained on
cuttings should be removed before disposal, particularly in drilling
operations offshore where cuttings may be discharged to the sea and
cause oil pollution of the marine environment. Alternatively they
have to be transported onshore for disposal which is costly and
time consuming. Future legislation will also require current
discharge levels to be reduced.If the use of oil based drilling muds is to continue, despite
more restrictive discharge legislation, efficient methods of
reducing or preventing oil on cutting discharge will be required. A solution to the problem of reducing oil discharge into the
sea would be the use of treatment facilities on an offshore platform
to remove the oil and allow the discharge of clean cuttings into the
sea.Several methods have been used to remove oil from drill
cuttings. In one method the oil based mud is washed from the
surface of the cuttings by use of a fluid medium, for example a
detergent. The cuttings are then discharged and the oil recovered
from the wash fluid. A major limitation in this method is that oil
internally absorbed into the pores of the rock cannot be removed and
between 30 and 50% of the original oil may be retained.Another method involves cleaning rather than washing the
cuttings. This may be carried out by means of a solvent extraction
system using, for example, toluene or methylene chloride as the
solvent. Oil may be extracted from the cuttings and then removed
from the solvent and reused. However the potential hazards caused
by the toxic nature of the solvent chemicals has raised doubts about
the method.We have now found a method capable of

<CLAIMS>
A method for removing organic contaminants from solid particles
comprising:


(a) providing solid particles contaminated with an organic
contaminant to a processing chamber,
(b) generating a circumferentially directed flow of fluid within
the chamber to cause the particles to circulate about an axis

of the chamber in a toroidal turbulent compact band,
(c) incinerating the contaminant within the band, and
(d) removing the particles substantially free from organic
contaminants from the chamber.
A method for removing organic contaminants from solid particles
according to Claim 1 comprising the preliminary steps of (i)

providing solid uncontaminated particles to the processing chamber
and (ii) generating a circumferentially directed flow of fluid

within the chamber to cause the uncontaminated particles to
circulate about an axis of the chamber in a toroidal turbulent compact band.
A method according to either of the preceding claims wherein the contaminated
particles are selected from the group consisting of inorganic rock, sand, pebbles or

soil contaminated with oil
A method according to claim 3 wherein
the contaminated particles are drill cuttings contaminated with oil.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the
contaminated particles are sand, pebbles or soil contaminated with

oil.
A method according to any of the preceding claims wherein the
particles are removed after incineration by means of a central

discharge and/or a side exit port. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims wherein the
particles are incinerated at a temperature in the range 600째C to

1200째C.
A method according to claim 7 wherein the particles are
incinerated at a temperature in the range 650째 to 950째C.
