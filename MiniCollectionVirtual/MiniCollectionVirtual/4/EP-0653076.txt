<ABSTRACT>
A device, particularly an antenna device, for emitting a beam of optical radiation to irradiate a remote target area. The device includes an optical source (10) having a limited wavelength band, and a hologram pattern (14) positioned in the path of a light beam originating from the source, the pattern being selected to produce a composite beam (20) having a predetermined shape or far field pattern conforming to the target area and/or a predetermined distribution of light intensity in the target area. Where the optical source is a point source, the hologram pattern (10) selectively retards the phase of respective components of the incident wavefront to produce a composite beam having a far field pattern that precludes focusing of the beam into a single small spot. The device has particular application in a telecommunication system wherein a data signal is transmitted through free space by an optical beam, at least one characteristic of the beam being controlled by the hologram pattern in the path of the beam.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device, particularly an antenna device, for 
emitting a beam of optical radiation to irradiate a remote target area. 
The invention also concerns an optical free space communication system 
where an antenna device is transmitting a signal over distances ranging 
from around half a metre up to several kilometres and where the remote 
target area is at least 0.5m2. It is well known that a laser can be used to produce a sharply defined 
and intense beam of infra-red radiation, and that a conventional lens 
can spread this beam out over a target area. Other point sources, such 
as infra-red light emitting diodes, can also produce sharply defined 
directional beams and are used, for example, to illuminate target areas 
in remote television and video control apparatus. In general, however, when irradiating a remote target area with optical 
radiation, much of the radiation from the original source inevitably 
falls outside the target area and is wasted. Moreover, although the 
angle of divergence of a beam can be controlled, there is little or no 
control over the intensity distribution within the beam or the shape of 
the beam envelope. It is particularly difficult to illuminate a 
square, rectangular or other non-circular target area with a uniform 
intensity beam. In an optical free space communication system where 
the radiation is carrying a telecommunication signal, the spillage of 
energy can also result in inadvertent detection of the signal by a 
detector outside the target area. With intensely bright optical sources, such as lasers, there is also a 
risk that the infra-red radiation could be inadvertently focused by a 
lens, for example a binocular lens, on to the skin, or worse still, the 
retina, and cause permanent damage. This latter problem is 
particularly acute at high power levels i.e. levels exceeding a few 
milliwatts and restricts the possible use of high power sources, 
including both light emitting diode (LED) and laser emitters, in an 
optical free space communication system, or in any application where 
optical radiation is emitted into a populated area.  
 A paper entitled "Transforming a circular laser beam into a square or 
trapezoid-almost" (Optical Engineering Vol. 31, No. 2, February 1992 
pp. 245-250) discusses how a computer-generated hologram positioned in 
the path of a laser beam can be arranged to transform the shape of the 
beam from, say, a round beam into a square beam with rounded corners. 
The transformation is based on the phenomenon that
