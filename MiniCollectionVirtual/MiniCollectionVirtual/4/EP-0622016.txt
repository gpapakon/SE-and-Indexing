<ABSTRACT>
A container (1) and distributor of water is 
internally provided with a bath (3) pivoted in 

such a way as to empty when full. A device 
comprising a floating piston (44) situated inside 

a chamber (41) enables water delivery rate to the 
bath (3) to be regulated by varying a water head 

contained in the chamber (41), and an outlet 
opening (43) in the chamber (41) conducts water 

into the bath (3). A rod (47), insertable in the 
outlet opening (43), prevents a build-up of 

residues therein deriving from impurities in the 
water, such that the outlet opening (43) does not 

become blocked or obstructed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention of the disclosure has a particular 
advantage in that it has no need of being attached 
to an electricity supply. Many controlled and continuous irrigation devices 
are well-known, for vases of flowers or plants 
situated on balconies or terraces, utilized 
especially during holiday periods, or at other 
moments when the owner may be away. Most of the examples in the prior art are 
electronic devices, essentially constituted by a 
electronic programmer connected to a running water 
supply through an open tap and having at its 
output a series of hoses arranged such as to reach 
the plants which have to be watered. The 
programmer establishes the watering 
modalities by programming a timer (set by a user) 
and acts on a valve connected to the tap and 
regulating the flow of water from the supply to 
the hoses. The user, acting on a series of buttons 
and/or knobs provided on the programmer, has only  
 
to select the irrigation program he or she wants, 
and the program does the rest: watering time, 
duration of watering operation, day of watering 
and so on. Such devices, however, present some drawbacks, one 
of which being that the device itself is dependent 
on the electrical supply, so that the supply 
cannot be turned off, which the user usually 
prefers to do when leaving his or her dwelling for 
a considerable amount of time. A further drawback is that the tap has to be left 
open, and if, during the user's absence, the 
device should become faulty, there might ensue a 
constant and very damaging flow of water into the 
room housing the device. A still further drawback is the high cost of these 
devices, in relation to their usefulness, which 
after all is usually only on the occasions when 
the user leaves his or her house for a longish 
period of time. The present applicant addressed the above problems 
when realising the device of patent IT 1,234,704, 
which comprises a water container and distributor 
provided at its base with a plurality of outlet 
holes for the water and an open bath to receive  
 
said water. The bath is housed internally in the 
container and can be pivoted on the container at a 
horizontal axis passing through its centre of 
gravity (calculated when the bath is full). Valve 
means are also provided (constituted by a tap) 
which act on a supply pipeline of water to the 
bath, varying the water supply to the bath. The 
device further comprises a counterweight to 
maintain the bath in a water-receiving position, 
and to bring the bath back into the same position
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>

plants, comprising:
 
a water container (1) provided with a series of 

water outlet holes (2) made on one base (1a) of 
the container (1);
 
a bath (3) for receiving water from a water source 

(12), housed in the container (1) and 
having an upwardly-facing open side (3a), and 

being pivoted to the container (1) on a bath 
horizontal axis (X), which axis is passing through the 

centre of gravity of the bath (3) when filled with 
water up to the upper rim of said bath (3);
 
means (4) for regulating a delivery rate of water 

to the bath (3), acting on a first water supply pipe (5) 
to the bath (3); said means (4) being arranged 

above the open side (3a) of the bath (3) and 
regulating a delivery of water into the 

bath (3) via an outlet opening (43);
 
means (8) for maintaining the bath (3) in a 

position whereat the open side (3a) faces in an 
upwards direction in order to receive water from  

 
the first water supply pipe (5) up to when water 

arrives at a level above said horizontal axis;
 
said means (8) having a further function of 

returning the bath (3) to said position whereat 
the open side (3a) faces in an upwards direction, 

after the bath (3) has rotated due to an 
unbalancing effect of received water arriving at a 

level above said horizontal axis (X) and has unloaded 
said water into the container (1); characterised by
 
a rod (47), connected to the bath (3) and having a 

smaller section than said outlet opening (43) 
and in at least one position of the bath (3), being slidably inserted 

in said outlet opening (43) 
such as to prevent a build-up of residues deriving 

from water-borne impurities at said outlet opening 
(43) and further
 
characterised in that the means (4) for regulating 

water delivery comprise:
 
a chamber (41) associated to the container (1) and 

provided with:
 
an inlet opening (42) connected to the first water 

supply pipe (5);
 
said outlet opening (43) for allowing water to flow 

into the bath (3);
 
a floating piston (44) having a smaller surface  

 
than a minimum internal horizontal section of the 

chamber (41), being vertically slidable internally 
of the chamber (41) and which can be prevented 

from reaching above determined heights between the 
inlet opening (42) and the outlet opening (43), in 

order that a water head in the chamber (41) can be 
pre-established and regulated;
 
a stiffened free end (5a) of the first water 

supply pipe (5), facing the floating piston (44) 
and functioning as a striker to stop an upwards 

vertical sliding of said floating piston (44) 
resulting from an upwards-pushing force exerted 

by the water head volume in the chamber (41).

said support (61) being mobile between a first 

position, whereat it is subject to the force of 
its own weight and the rod (47) is external to the 

outlet opening (43), and a second position,
  
 

whereat it is subject to a thrust by the bath (3) 
when the bath (3) is in a rotated position, and

at fillings and at emptyings of the bath (3). 
A controlled irrigation device 
for plants, as in claim 2 or 3, characterised in 

that the free end (5a) of the water supply pipe
