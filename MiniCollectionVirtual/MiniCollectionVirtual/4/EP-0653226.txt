<ABSTRACT>
This apparatus comprises: detector means (2) for collecting information (3, 4) regarding the condition of the patient and/or of the apparatus; a clock (9); an addressable memory (13); triggering means (8) for recognizing the occurrence of at least one predetermined type of event and for producing, in this case, a triggering signal (12) representative of the predetermined event type; and first processing means (6) for constituting an event recording covering a given time period and for storing this recording in a first sector of the memory. According to the invention, provision is made to store the information relating to a cardiac episode at a plurality of detail levels, an increasing detail level corresponding to a shorter recording period. It is possible in particular, to record events which are dated but occur less often than marker-chain events, thus making it possible, with the same memory space, to cover a longer duration than with a marker chain.

information, said memory being partitioned into sectors for storing distinct

covering a first period of time, and so as to store said event record in a first
sector of the memory;

   the apparatus being characterized by:

second processor means (6) responsive to at least one
predetermined value of the trigger signal to combine the data coming from the

detector means, the data coming from the clock-forming means, and the

covering a second time period, and so as to store said event record in a
second memory sector,

   the second level of detail including less detail than the first level and
the second time period being longer than the first time period.
The apparatus of claim 1, in which the second processor means store an
event log comprising a plurality of event log entries to log events that occur

less frequently than stimulation and detection events, each event log entry
containing a code representative of the type of event, at least one additional

parameter representative of the state of the patient or of the apparatus, and
information indicating the instant at which the event occurred. 
The apparatus of claim 2, in which one of the predetermined types of event
is a predetermined time interval as measured by the clock elapsing so as to

record event log entries at a predetermined constant frequency.
The apparatus of claim 3, in which the additional parameter representative
of the state of the patient or of the apparatus comprises the value, over said

predetermined time interval, of at least one of the parameters in the group
comprising: the number of ventricular beats detected; the number of auricular

beats detected; the number of ventricular extrasystoles detected; the shortest
length of the ventricular cycle; and the mean length of the ventricular cycle

over the latest time interval.
The apparatus of claim 2, in which the detector means classify the heart
rhythm into categories comprising a sinus rhythm and one or more classes of

tachyarrhythmia, one of the predetermined types of event comprising a
change in the classification of the heart rhythm detected by the apparatus and

the additional parameter representative of the state of the patient or of the
apparatus comprises at least one of the parameters in the group comprising:

the class of the rhythm and the classification criteria; said criteria comprising
at least one of the parameters in the group comprising: frequency, mean

frequency, acceleration, and stability of the rhythm, and also auriculo-ventricular
association.
The apparatus of claim 2, in which, for apparatus capable of applying anti-tachycardial
stimulation therapy, one of the predetermined types of event is

the application of an anti-tachycardial stimulation sequence to the patient.
The apparatus of claim 6, in which the additional parameter relating to the
state of the patient or of the apparatus comprises at least one of the

parameters in the group comprising: identity of the anti-tachycardial
stimulation program and sequence; the number of sequences delivered; the

lastest escape interval; the number of cycles in the lastest delivered
sequence; and the number of cycles during which a ventricular detection has

occurred. 
The apparatus of claim 2, in which the apparatus includes defribillator
means, one of the predetermined types of event is the application of shock

therapy to the patient and the additional parameter relating to the state of the
patient or of the apparatus comprises at least one of the parameters in the

group comprising: the number of the shock program; the number of shocks
delivered by the program; the end-of-shock voltage; the initial shock voltage;

the duration of the shock; the waveform of the shock; and charging time.
The apparatus of claim 8, in which the predetermined event types comprise
at least one event in the group comprising: the occurrence of fibrillation or of

tachycardia requiring cardioversion therapy; the occurrence of tachycardia
requiring therapy by anti-tachycardial stimulation; the application of

cardioversion therapy; and the application of anti-tachycardial stimulation
therapy.
The apparatus of claim 1, in which one of the treatment means stores a
chain of event markers for marking stimulation and detection events, each

event marker comprising a code corresponding to the type of event and a
time code enabling external programmer means to determine the instant at

which each marked event occurred.
