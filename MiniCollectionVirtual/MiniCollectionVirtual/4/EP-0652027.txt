<ABSTRACT>
The device is intended to introduce a solution of active substance into a patient, and it possesses means for fastening on the skin and a cannula (9). Before use, the cannula is held in a retracted position by a holding and triggering mechanism (14) and after triggering it is shot into the skin of the patient. A connection (6) connected to the back of the cannula is intended to connect the cannula to an active substance reservoir.
