<ABSTRACT>
A disc data recording and/or reproducing apparatus for 
recording and/or reproducing data to or from a pair of 

separated data tracks on a disc is provided. The apparatus 
includes a pair of recording and/or reproducing heads (4, 5) 

for recording or reproducing data in cooperation with each 
other to or from the pair of separated data tracks of the 

disc (2), a head travel controller (6, 7) for controlling the 
pair of recording and/or reproducing heads to travel 

oppositely with each other in the radial direction of the 
disc (2), and a data rate controller (6, 7) for dividing or 

integrating data written or read by the pair of recording 
and/or reproducing heads (4, 5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc data 
recording and/or reproducing disc apparatus, and more 
particularly to a double-head type disc data 
reproducing and/or reproducing apparatus. A constant angular velocity system (hereinafter 
referred to as a CAV system) recording format has been 
currently adopted for general hard disc apparatus or 
magneto-optic disc apparatus. The CAV system has the 
merit that access time is fast since the data rate when 
writing and reading operations of the disc is easy 
since the disc rotation speed is constant. However, 
there are problems with respect to recording capacity 
as the recording density is very different between the 
inner and outer portions of the disc. Conventionally, a constant linear velocity system 
(hereinafter referred to as a CLV system) which has 
been adopted for music compact disc, etc. has the merit 
of increased recording capacity since the recording 
density is constant over the entire disc surface. 
However, it has the problem that the disc rotation 
speed has to be changed according to the track position 
which is traced by the magnetic head or light beam and 
if the travelling distance of the magnetic head or 
light beam increases for search, etc., the seek-time 
for the rotation speed has a time lag and access time 
increases. So, as a means of accommodating the merits of the 
two recording formats described above, there is the 
known modified CAV system (hereinafter referred to as 
an M-CAV system). In this M-CAV system, the recording 
capacity is secured by making the recording density 
uniform by changing the amount of data to be recorded 
on each recording track while keeping the disc rotation 
speed constant. This system has the feature that the 
further the track tracing position of the magnetic head  
 
or light beam travels from the inner portion of the 
outer portion of the disc the more the data rate 
increases. In this system, however, if a higher speed of data 
writing or reading is demanded, the performance of such 
analog circuits as RF circuitry must be adapted to the 
data rate of the outer portion of the disc. However, 
in the case where it is inconvenient if a time lag is 
inadvantageously large at the time when reading or 
writing image data and/or audio data, it has to be 
adapted to a data rate of the inner portion of a disc, 
and therefore there were some uselessness in the design 
of the analog circuitry. In addition, there is the 
problem that the balance in circuit configuration 
becomes worse because of the
