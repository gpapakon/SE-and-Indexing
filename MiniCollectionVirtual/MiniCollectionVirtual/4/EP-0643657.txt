<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to vessels and other marine constructions situated in or brought forward in a fluent medium. The invention is characterized in that the marine constructions are provided with fiber flock on surfaces coming in contact with the medium. This will cause a reduced inclination for plants and animals to grow on and damage the construction (anti-fouling) and a reduced friction against the medium when the vessel is moving.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vessels brought forward in a
fluent medium meeting a resistance of flow due to friction
against the surrounding medium, and other marine
constructions which at least partially reaches under the
surface of water. Especially, the invention relates to
coatings below the surface of water for anti-fouling and
keeping friction low.Vessels of the abovementioned type are floating in or
supported by a surrounding medium both when they are
stationnary and moving forwards. Vessels also encounter a
powerful resistance of flow when driven forwards, the
resistance increasing with the square of the speed as it
increases. The resistance of flow depends mainly on the
friction against the surrounding medium and the greatest part
altogether of the input energy to the vessel is consumed for
overcoming this frictional resistance. In order to reduce
this resistance of friction and flow, up to now vessels have
been made streamlined and the surfaces facing the medium as
even and smooth as possible. One has also tried to paint the
surfaces with friction reducing means and used toxic paints
for preventing overgrowing and thereby increasing resistance
of flow.Tests to reduce the friction between a vessel in movement and
the surrounding medium have so far only been partly
successful. It is true that big improvements in this respect
has been done during later decades, but it is still a fact
that big amounts of energy in the form of fuel have to be
used. This, of course, is a big problem concerning the costs,
but at least as big concerning the environment which is
polluted by all the exhaust gases. From the above mentioned reasons it has been a longfelt want
to be able to reduce overgrowing and the frictional
resistance between a vessel in movement and the surrounding
medium and according to the present invention I have provided
a method for preventing overgrowth as described in claim 1.It is advisable to provide hulls with fiber flock up to the
water line. Submarines, which often are driven totally
immersed in water should be provided with flock all over the
surface. Because of the lower energy consumption the
submarine can stay longer under water and it is more silent
due to the noise reduction in the flock layer.The technique for providing fiber flock to a surface is well
known. It consists of providing an area with an adhesive
whereafter electrically charged fibres are caused to land in
the adhesive and are fastened in it. The adhesive often is a
two component resin and the fibres usually are

Method of preventing overgrowth on surfaces under the
water line on vessels and other marine constructions,


characterized in
 providing the surfaces wholly or
partially with fiber flock consisting of a high density of

thin, short synthetic textile fibres, applying the fiber
flock directly in an adhesive on the surfaces with an

electrostatic technology.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that
the fibres have a length between 0.5 and 5 mm and a density

of 50-300 fibres per square mm.
Method according to claim 2, 
characterized in
 that
the fibres have a length between 0.5 and 3 mm and a density

of 150-300 fibres per square mm.
