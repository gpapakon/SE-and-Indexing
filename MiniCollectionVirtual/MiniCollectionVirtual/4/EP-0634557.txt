<ABSTRACT>
The strip forms foam when heated, being contained in a groove in the frame open towards the end face of the door when this is shut. The strip (7) is formed by overlapping sections (8) of foam-forming material each fully encapsulated in aluminium foil (9). The groove (6) in the frame is closed by U-section clamping strips (10) covering all the strip-sections (8). The groove can be of undercut dovetail-section, the edges (11) of the clamping strips being bent over so as to fit in the undercut portions. The clamping-strip surfaces (12) furthest from the groove can be flush with the adjacent surfaces (13,14) of the frame.
