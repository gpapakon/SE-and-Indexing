<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for joining together at least two material flows in a laminar coextrusion machine comprising at least two extruders, more precisely as many extruders as layers of different materials used, a device for joining together the flows coming from the extruders into a so-called global flow, said device being also called distribution box and, an extrusion head supplied by the global flow. The joining device comprises a main channel (6) wherein arrive annexe channels called supplied channels conveying the different material flows coming from the extruders, said channels being provided with means for restricting the flow passage cross-section. The device is characterized in that the supply channel connecting each extruder to the main channel is made at least partially in a cylindrical plug valve (9) comprising means (10) which transforms a cylindrical reed into a planar sheet.

<CLAIMS>
A device for combining at least two streams of material in a 
co-extrusion laminating machine, itself comprising: 


at least two extruders (2), more precisely as many extruders (2) 
as layers of different materials used, 
a device (3) for combining the streams issuing from the 
extruders (2) to form an aggregate stream (4), the device (3) also 

being referred to as a distributing box, 
an extrusion head (5) fed by the aggregate stream, and 
means (10) for converting a cylindrical rod into a flat sheet,
 
the combining device comprising a main channel (6) supplied by 

subsidiary feed channels (7) conveying the different streams of 
material issuing from the extruders, the said channels (7) being 

provided with means (8) for limiting the cross-section of flow of the 
stream,
 
the device being characterised in that the feed channel (7) 

connecting each extruder to the main channel (6) is at least 
partially arranged in a valve (9) having a cylindrical plug, the 

valve (9) comprising the means (10) for converting a cylindrical rod 
into a flat sheet. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the valve (9) 
having a cylindrical plug comprises: 


a body having a cylindrical bore (11) communicating with the  
 

main channel (6), substantially tangentially to the plane (P) of 
displacement of the stream in the main channel (6), by means of 

a slot (12) parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bore, 
a cylindrical plug (13) provided in the bore (11) and itself 
comprising: 


an axial channel (14), one (15) of the ends (15, 16) of which 
opens into one (17) of the opposing ends (17, 18) of the plug (13), 

the extruder being connected at least indirectly to the end (15) 
and the other end (16) communicating with one (20) of the ends 

(20, 21) of a substantially radial channel, the other end (21) of 
which opens into the outer surface (22) of the plug (13), at which 

point the outer surface of the plug has, over a portion of its 
periphery, a relief (24) which, when seen in outline, has the shape 

of a fan, the axis of symmetry of which is in a plane perpendicular 
to the axis of rotation of the plug (13) so that the base of the relief 

and the wall of the bore form an intermediate channel (26) 
connecting the axial channel to the slot of the bore. 
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the shapes of 
the relief are selected in order to convert a rod of circular section 

into a flat sheet. 
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that: 

the terminal end of the relief (24) is shaped so as to direct the 
stream flowing between the base of the relief (24) and the inner 

surface of the bore towards the slot formed between the bore 
and the main channel, and 
the outer wall of the plug (13), located beyond the terminal 
edge of the relief (24), constitutes, for the slot connecting the bore  

 
and the main channel, a means of regulating the cross-section of 

flow in this slot according to the position of the terminal edge 
relative to the slot. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the plugs 
are supplied laterally. 
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the slot of the 
bore communicates with the main channel by means of a short 

linking channel formed in the thickness of the casing of the main 
channel. 
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that the thickness 
and the width of the main channel are determined by 

interchangeable cartridges (30). 
A device according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
interchangeable cartridges are interconnected in a joining plane 

to form an upper and a lower casing, the joining plane being co-planar 
with the horizontal median plane of the main channel.
