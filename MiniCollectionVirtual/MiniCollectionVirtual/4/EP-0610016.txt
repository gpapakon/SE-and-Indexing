represented by the formula: 


(wherein n₁ stands for 1 or 2 and, when n₁ is 1, R₁ stands 
for an alkyl group of up to 14 carbon atoms, an aralkyl 

group of up to 14 carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkyl group of up 
to 14 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group of up to 14 carbon 

atoms, or an aryl group of up to 14 carbon atoms, and when 
n₁ is 2, R₁ stands for an alkylene group of up to 16 

carbon atoms, an aralkylene group of up to 16 carbon 
atoms, an oxaalkylene group of up to 16 carbon atoms, a 

cycloalkylene group of up to 16 carbon atoms, or a 
phenylene group of up to 16 carbon atoms) is a novel

formula) to react with 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethylhydroperoxide. 

It is useful as a 
polymerization initiator for a vinyl monomer, a curing 

agent for an unsaturated polyester resin and a crosslinking 
agent for a polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel peroxy carbonate,
a method for the production thereof, and uses therefor.It is known to use dialkyl peroxides such as dicumyl
peroxide, peroxy ketals such as l,l-bis(t-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethyl
cyclohexane, and peroxy esters such as
t-butyl-peroxyisopropyl carbonate and t-butylperoxy
benzoate, all of which are organic peroxides active at
medium to high temperatures, as polymerization
initiators, cross-linking agents, and curing agents (as
disclosed in Japanese Patent Public Disclosure SHO
62(1987)-246908, Japanese Patent Publication SHO
52(1977)-31255 and Japanese Patent Public Disclosure SHO
62(1987)-43409). US-A-3082236 discloses peroxy esters
of p-menthane hydroperoxides.Notwithstanding, from the practical viewpoint, there
continues to be a need for polymeriztation inititators,
cross-linking agents, and curing agents that are of
higher quality than these known compounds.Through a long-term study, the present inventors
having ascertained that 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethylperoxy
carbonate, a novel compound not yet reported in the
literature, satisfies this need. This invention has been
accomplished as a result.To be specific, this invention is directed to a 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethylperoxy
carbonate as claimed in 
claim 1.The invention also embraces a method of
polymerisation of a vinyl monomer as claimed in claim 9,
a method of curing an unsaturated polymer as claimed in
claim 10, and a method of cross-linking a polymer as per
claim 11.The 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethylperoxy carbonate of
this invention (hereinafter referred to simply as the
"peroxy carbonate of this invention") has a structure
possessing methyl groups and a cyclohexyl group attached
to the carbon atom having a peroxy group coupled
therewith(α-position carbon). It is a novel compound not
yet reported in the literature.The upper limit of the number of carbon atoms of the
substituent R1 in the formula shown above is decided with
consideration to the practical utility of the novel
compound. The alkyl group or alkylene group may be in
a linear form or a branched form.As concrete examples of the peroxy carbonate of this
invention, 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethylperoxyisopropyl
carbonate, 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethylperoxy-sec-butyl
carbonate, 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethylperoxy-2-ethylhexyl
carbonate, 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethylperoxycyclododecyl
carbonate, 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethylperoxy-2-methoxybutyl
carbonate, and 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethylperoxy-p-tolyl 
carbonate may be cited.The peroxy carbonates of this
