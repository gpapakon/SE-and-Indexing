<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for recycling polyester and cotton 
blend fabrics by separating the polyester from the cotton fabric. 

The novel process to recycle the polyester/cotton blend fabrics 
includes the steps of (a) providing a polyester and cotton blend 

fabric; (b) charging said blend into a sulfone solvent; (c) 
dissolving the polyester in the sulfone solvent; (d) separating 

the dissolved polyester and sulfone solvent solution from the 
cotton fabric; (e) filtering the cotton to obtain isolated, 

cotton fabric.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for recycling 
polyester and cotton blend fabrics in such a way as to separate 
the polyester from the cotton fabric. Large volumes of textile wastes are produced annually in the 
manufacture of clothing and other textile products. A large 
percentage of the textile waste is accounted for by 
polyester/cellulosic fabrics such as polyester/cotton and 
polyester/rayon blends. The reuse of the blended materials is 
complicated by the fact that there are inherent differences in 
the physical properties and composition of the two components. 
Additionally, the fabrics are treated with resinous materials and 
other finishes such as flame retardants which limit reusability. 
This makes it nearly impossible to find potential commercial end 
uses for this material other than rags or cloth scraps which are 
of little monetary value. Disposal of such large volumes of solid waste is an 
increasing problem for the apparel industry. The rising cost, 
reduction in available space, and concern for the environment are 
making burning and landfilling the textile waste dwindling 
options. Therefore, potential methods of recycling 
polyester/cotton fabric blends have been pursued.  Waste polyester scrap can be recycled for reuse by various 
processes. It is known that polyesters can be dissolved in 
solvents and solvent systems such as 1,1,1,3,3,3 - 
hexafluoropropanol, phenol/tetrachloroethane, or trichloroacetic 
acid/chloroform. Technical, economic, and environmental 
considerations of this process limit its applicability. These 
are among the reasons that solvent systems such as these are only 
of interest for analytical investigations. Another method for recovery of polyester scrap is by means 
of dissolution of the polyester in various solvents, thereafter 
precipitating and recovering the polyester. A process has been 
disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,003,880 providing a method 
whereby dye-stripping, separation, and polyester recovery are 
combined in such a way as that the dye-stripping phase actually 
constitutes the first step of the dissolution and separation 
phase. After the dye-stripping is completed, the fibers remain 
saturated with a dye-stripping solvent, which can also be used 
for dissolution of the polyester. The dissolution of the 
polyester and its subsequent precipitation and separation from 
the solvent serves to complete the dye removal in addition to the 
separation and recovery of the polyester. Alternatively, there are processes which involve degrading
