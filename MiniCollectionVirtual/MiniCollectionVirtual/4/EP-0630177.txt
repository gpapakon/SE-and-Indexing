<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a parts feeder which 
conveys and feeds parts held by a carrier tape. In a known parts feeder, parts to be conveyed are 
held on a carrier tape having a support tape (base tape) 
which is provided with holes spaced at an equidistance and 
an adhesive tape adhered to a lower surface of the support 
tape. The adhesive tape is adhered to the bottoms of the 
parts disposed on the holes to immovably hold the parts. 
Namely, the adhesive tape is bent into the holes of the 
support tape so that the adhesive tape can be adhered to 
the bottoms of the parts exposed to the through holes. In 
such a known parts feeder, when the adhesive tape is 
separated from the support tape, the connection between the 
parts and the adhesive tape is broken, so that the parts 
are merely disposed on the support tape without an adhesion 
thereto, thus resulting in a displacement of the parts from 
the support tape. To prevent this, the operation sequence 
was formulated such that the separation of the adhesive 
tape from the support tape takes place after a suction 
force is applied to the parts by a suction nozzle of a part  
 
mounting device. In this sequence, however, since no 
separation of the adhesive tape from the support tape can 
be effected until the parts are held by the suction device, 
the time intervals for feeding the parts are increased, 
resulting in an increased time for the feeding operation. The primary object of the present invention is to 
provide a parts feeder using a carrier tape, wherein the 
time intervals of the parts feeding operation can be 
shortened The inventors of the present application have found 
that if the parts to be fed are pressed against the support 
tape of the carrier tape before the adhesive tape is 
separated or stripped from the support tape, the separation 
of the adhesive tape from the support tape can be carried 
out without waiting for the completion of the suction 
operation of the parts by the suction nozzle. Namely, to achieve the object mentioned above, 
according to the present invention, there is provided a 
parts feeder for feeding parts that are disposed on a 
carrier tape consisting of a base tape and an adhesive 
tape, wherein the parts are disposed above holes which are 
formed at equal intervals on the base tape, and wherein the 
parts are held by an adhesive tape adhered to a lower  
 
surface of the base tape. The parts feeder includes a 
pitched feeding mechanism for intermittently feeding the 
carrier tape at a predetermined
