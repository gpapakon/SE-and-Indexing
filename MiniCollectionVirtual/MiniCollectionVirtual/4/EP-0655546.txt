<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a turnstile arrangement having a blocking element which exhibits wings which extend away from the axis of rotation, having a directing element which extends, peripherally with respect to the turning circle of the blocking element, approximately over a circumferential angle corresponding to the angle between adjacent blocking-element wings, and having a blocking screen which extends, on the side remote from the directing element, into the turning circle of said blocking element. In the case of said turnstile arrangement, the directing element is designed to be of a height which is approximately hip level, and adjoining this on the side remote from the blocking element there is arranged a through-passage which can be released and closed off by means of at least one door element and is intended for taking through bicycles.

Turnstile installation combined with a passage device for bicycles and with a barrier
element (14), which is borne to be rotatable about a vertical rotary axle and comprises

wings (15), which are of grating rods arranged at a spacing one above the other and
extend forth from the rotary axle (16) whilst including preferably equal angles between

them, with a guide element (18) extending peripherally to the rotary circle of the barrier
element (14) and across about a peripheral angle corresponding with the angle between

neighbouring barrier element wings (15) and with a barrier rake (13), which on the side
remote from the guide element (18) reaches into the rotary circle of the barrier element

(14) and is of grating rods which are arranged at a spacing one above the other displaced
in height relative to the grating rods of the barrier element wings (15), and with a passage

path (20, 120), which is arranged to be adjoining on the side remote from the barrier
element (14) and freeable and closable by means of at least one door element (22),

characterised thereby, that the guide element (18) is constructed to be only about hip-high,
whereby the guiding-along of a bicycle in the passage path by a person passing the

turnstile installation is possible.
Turnstile installation according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that a swing door
(22, 122, 122'), which is hinged to be pivotable about a vertical axis (21, 121, 121')

between an opening position and a closed setting, is concerned in the case of the door
element selectably freeing or barring the passage path (20, 120) for the guiding-along of

bicycles.
Turnstile installation according to claim 2, characterised thereby, that the swing
door (22, 122) is hinged to be pivotable by its edge remote from the barrier element (14).
Turnstile installation according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby,
that the door element (22, 122, 122') is equipped with an electromechanical lock and/or a

motorised drive for actuation out of the closed setting into the opening position and
conversely.
Turnstile installation according to claim 4, characterised by a sensor system (25,
25'), which responds to a bicycle guided along by a person passing the installation, for the 

control of the unlatching of the electromechanical lock and/or of the motorised drive for the
actuation of the door element (22, 122, 122').
Turnstile installation according to claim 5, characterised thereby, that an induction
loop is concerned in the case of the sensor system for the control of the unlatching of the

lock and/or of the door element drive.
Turnstile installation according to claim 5, characterised thereby, that a light barrier
serves as means for the control of the unlatching of the lock and/or of the door element

drive.
Turnstile installation according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterised thereby,

that the passage path (20) for the guiding-along of bicycles is provided with guide planks
(24, 24'), which are near to the ground and arranged in passage direction at a spacing one

from the other, which frees a travel path for the track wheels of bicycles.
Turnstile installation according to claim 8, characterised thereby, that the ends of
the guide planks (24, 24') are set outwardly each to the respective side facing away from

the travel path and form funnel-shaped introductory guide portions.
Turnstile installation according to one of the claims 1 to 9, characterised thereby,
that the additional travel path for the guiding-along of bicycles is constructed as gate path

(120) with door elements arranged in passage direction at a spacing one from the other.
Turnstile installation according to claim 10, characterised thereby, that the
longitudinal extent of the gate path (120) forming the bicycle passage is greater between

its door elements (122, 122') than the length of normal bicycles.
Turnstile installation according to claim 10 or 11, characterised thereby, that the
guide element (118), which is arranged between the passage for persons and the bicycle

passage, extends substantially over the entire length of the gate path (120).
