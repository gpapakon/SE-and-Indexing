<ABSTRACT>
Simplified measurement equipment (100) is described in which any two 
frequency sources can be accurately and quantitatively compared to each other. 

With this simplified measurement equipment, calibration can be performed on an 
oscillator (102,103) using an external reference signal (119), while the oscillator is 

being used in an active system. By simplifying the measurement equipment, the 
equipment can be built into a time base unit allowing recalibration to be performed 

at relatively short time intervals. A frequency difference detector (100) based on 
ring counters (108,109) and an existing controller (101) in a telecommunication 

switching system compare an accurate external reference (119) against an oscillator 
(102,103) of the time base unit for calibration in the field. Within the 

telecommunication switching system, a highly accurate external reference signal 
(119) is normally available from an interconnected telecommunication network. The 

use of ring counters (108,109) in the frequency difference detector (100) allows for 
simple measurement equipment which adds little to the cost of the time base unit. 

Further, since measurement equipment is all digital, no tuning of the equipment is 
necessary as is required of measurement equipment having analog components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods for detecting a
difference in frequency between an oscillator signal and a reference signal.In precision synchronization systems, a local time base reference of
great accuracy and stability is required to generate and measure clock signals in a
system within a certain accuracy. These time bases have normally crystal frequency
sources; the characteristics of such devices are well known. In addition to variations
in output frequency resulting from temperature and supply voltage changes, these
devices have an aging characteristic which implies that, over a long period of time,
the output frequency will depart from the desired, nominal value. In order to
maintain accuracies required in many telecommunication systems, either expensive
oscillators must be used to overcome the aging effect or periodic calibration of the
oscillators is required.Calibration is often done manually; time base units are sent in to a
calibration facility for extremely precise applications or can be field adjusted for less
critical applications. In either case, the reference frequency source used for
calibration must be more accurate than the time base unit to be calibrated. By
measuring the adjustable time base with respect to the reference, the correction
information can be obtained for adjusting the oscillator of the time base unit. The
measurement equipment is extremely complicated and expensive, since it is
designed to perform over a large range of frequencies. Additionally, the calibration
procedure is expensive and usually requires the unit to be taken out of service.GB-A-2 122 822 discloses a first counter counting at the frequency of a
signal from an oscillator, and a second counter counting at the frequency of a
reference signal. It also discloses a method for starting the first and second counters
and for generating a signal upon the difference between the frequency of the
reference signal and the oscillator signal differing by a predetermined amount.Research Disclosure, No. 344, December 1992, Havant, GB, "Automatic
Detection of Oscillator Frequency Drift", page 964 discloses a method for detecting
a frequency drift between two oscillators. The method uses two free-running gray-code
counters each clocked by a different oscillator. With the initial state of one
counter being zero and the initial state of the other counter being one-half of the
maximum value of the counter, the frequency drift is detected whenever the values
of the two counters become equal to each
