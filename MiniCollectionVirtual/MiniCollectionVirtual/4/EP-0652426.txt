<ABSTRACT>
The method for the early recognition of piston and/or cylinder disturbances, especially of scuffing or fretting (jamming) wear in diesel engines, is especially well suited to slow-running and medium-speed large diesel engines which operate at speeds from less than 100 to about 300 rev/min. The continuous and/or cyclic measurement of the temperature of the cylinder wall using a temperature sensor (12) at least at one point in the upper region of the piston (1) and the recognition of the temperature variation which is characteristic of the disturbance, or the detection of the characteristic variables for fretting wear/scuffing/piston ring fretting which are derived from the characteristic temperature variation, enable the early recognition of the incipient disturbance long before damage occurs in the engine. Countermeasures such as reduction of the power (13, 171, 17) and/or increasing the lubricant feed (13, 161, 16', 16) can be introduced immediately, manually or automatically. On the other hand, these measures can be reversed once more and a switch can be made back to normal operation if the characteristic variables or disturbance indicating signals have vanished once more.

Method for the early recognition of piston and/or cylinder disorders,
in particular, of scuffing and wear due to seizure of diesel engines,

and, in particular in a large diesel engine which operate at low to
medium speeds,


the continuous and/or cyclic measurement of the temperature of the
cylinder wall at least one position in the upper region of the piston,

by the recognition of the characteristic temperature variation for the
disorder, and/or by the recognition of characteristic values which are

derived from the characteristic temperature variation.

characterised by

the determination of the change in temperature over a time interval;
by the determination of changes in temperature, as well as, the
recognition of the attainment of a predetermined positive temperature

gradient in a first time interval;
by the determination of the change in temperature, as well as, by the
recognition of the attainment of a predetermined positive temperature

difference in a second time interval; and
by the determination of the frequency of the positive predetermined
temperature gradient in connection with the predetermined positive

temperature difference over the second time interval within a third
time interval, whereby the disorder is recognised with the attainment

or overshooting of a predetermined frequency in this third time
interval.
Method according to claim 1, in which

the predetermined temperature gradient is at least 1째C per several
seconds; 
the temperature difference reaches several 째C; and
the predetermined temperature gradient is observed within a given
number of minutes in conjunction with the predetermined

temperature differences, with a predetermined frequency which is
characteristic for the engine and the sensor arrangement.
Method according to claim 2, in which

the temperature gradient is greater than or equal to 1째C per 20
seconds;
the temperature difference reached is greater than or equal to 4째C;
and
this temperature gradient in conjunction with the temperature
difference is viewed at least 4 times within 20 minutes.
Method according to claim 1, in which the temperature is measured
continually or cyclically in first time intervals;


the variance of the temperature changes is preferably determined in a
frequency band which includes frequencies of the temperature

variation which is characteristic for the disorder to be recognised,
whereby this variance is continually determined over a historic time

interval and the disorder which is starting to manifest itself is
recognised as such when it is recognised that the variance has

exceeded a predetermined value.
Method according to claim 1, in which

the temperature is measured continually or cyclically in first time
intervals;
from the temperature variation a predetermined frequency band is
filtered out which includes the frequencies of the temperature

variation, which is characteristic for the disorder to be recognised; 
the curve of the square values of the filtered out frequencies of the
changes in temperature, is squared and then integrated and thus the

variance of the temperature changes in the frequency band is
determined;
with this calculation of variance being continually determined over a
historic time interval and with the disorder which is manifesting itself

being recognised on recognising that a predetermined value of the
variance has been exceeded.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, in which the temperature

values of the cylinder wall are measured in the region of the upper
points of reversal of the first and second piston rings.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, in which the measured
temperature values of the cylinder wall are measured at a number of

positions arranged around the periphery of the cylinder.
Method according to claim 7, in which the measured temperature
values of each measurement position, are evaluated in their own right

for the recognition of a disorder.
Method according to claim 8, in which the notification of a disorder
only follows if at the same time, a disorder is recognised on the basis

of the measurement values from at least two positions. 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to one of claims 1
to 9, having at least one temperature sensor in the upper region of

the cylinder wall and means to detect and process the measurement
values, with one or more of the foltowing means:


means for the representation of the measurement values,
means for the automatic recognition of disorders,
means for influencing the power of one or more cylinders,
the supply of lubricant to one or more cylinders,
means to trigger an alarm signal.
Diesel engine having an apparatus for the recognition of disorders
which works according to a method according to one of claims 1 to

9.
Use of the Diesel engine according to claim 11 in a ship.
