<ABSTRACT>
A π/4 shift QPSK modulator has a phase operator for 
receiving first and second input data at a predetermined 

symbol cycle, and for producing a first pair of output data 
after every even number symbol cycle and producing a second 

pair of output data after every odd number symbol cycle. The 
first and second pairs of output data are applied to four 

digital filters. A selector sequentially selects and produces 
the four filtered digital data. An invertor inverts the 

polarity of the filtered digital data after every four 
filtered digital data from the selector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital filter 
for band limiting a π/4 shift QPSK modulation signal used in 
digital communications devices used, for example, in cellular 
communications systems. Band limiting using digital filters is widely used 
in digital phase modulation methods, including π/4 shift QPSK 
modulation. Digital phase modulation requires band limiting 
of the modulation signal to prevent interference with adjacent 
channels, and to prevent inter-symbol interference at the 
symbol decision timing. For example, band limiting of the 
modulation signal using a roll-off characteristic filter may 
be required. Digital filters are generally used for these 
applications because it is difficult to achieve sufficiently 
precise filtering characteristics in an analog circuit. In this application, all response outputs of the 
filter must be precalculated for all input data strings and 
stored to a memory device in the digital filter providing band 
limiting of the π/4 shift QPSK modulation signal. The memory 
device is then referenced using the data string to be  
 
transmitted to obtain the filter output signal. The π/4 shift QPSK modulation process is described 
below with reference to Figs. 9a-9d and 10-14. Figs. 9a-9d 
shows the position of the signal points in QPSK modulation. 
QPSK modulation can simultaneously transmit two bits of data 
by means of signal points in four phases. For example, in 
Fig. 9a, the signal point at the first quadrant (top right) 
represents two bit combination of [0,0], the second quadrant 
(top left) represents two bit combination of [0,1], the third 
quadrant (bottom left) represents two bit combination of 
[1,1], and the fourth quadrant (bottom right) represents two 
bit combination of [1,0]. The four signal points [0,0], 
[0,1], [1,1] and [1,0] in Fig. 9a can be expressed by four 
vectors (u/√2, u/√2), (-u/√2, u/√2), (-u/√2, -u/√2) and (u/√2, 
-u/√2), respectively, in which u is a length of the vector. 
Each combination of two data bits that can be simultaneously 
transmitted is referred to below as a "symbol". π/4 shift 
QPSK modulation is obtained by rotating the phase of the QPSK 
modulation signal points π/4 each symbol. Thus, the four 
signal points connected by the square dotted line rotates π/4 
and change their positions after each symbol cycle, as shown 
in Figs. 9a-9d. In other words, the π/4 shift QPSK modulator 
must execute modulation with the signal points positioned in 
eight phases as shown in Fig. 10. To express the eight points 
on the plane
