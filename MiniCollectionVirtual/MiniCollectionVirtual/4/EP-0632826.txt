A process for the production of free-flowing detergent 
granules and/or partial granules, 
characterized in that
 
water-containing alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglycoside pastes 

are dried in the presence of anionic and/or nonionic 
surfactants and/or typical detergent ingredients to a 

residual moisture content of 0.1 to 5% by weight and, at 
the same time, granulated in a turbodryer with rotating 

fittings. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglycosides used correspond to 

formula (I): 

R
1
O-(R
2
O)
x
-[G]
p
 
in which 


R
1
is an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing 8 to 22 
carbon atoms and 0, 1, 2 or 3 double bonds, 
R
2
is an alkylene group containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms, 
x
is 0 or a number of 1 to 30, 
[G]
is a sugar unit containing 5 to 6 carbon atoms and 
p
is a number of 1 to 10. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
alkyl and alkenyl oligoglycoside pastes having a water 

content of 20 to 80% by weight, based on the paste, are 
used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the anionic surfactants used are selected from the group 

consisting of soaps, alkyl benzene sulfonates, olefin 
sulfonates, alkane sulfonates, alkyl ether sulfonates, 

alpha-sulfofatty acids, internal sulfofatty acids, alpha-ester 
sulfonates, glycerol ether sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, 

normal-range or narrow-range alkyl ether sulfates, 
glycerol ether sulfates, monoglyceride (ether) sulfates, 

hydroxy mixed ether sulfates, alkyl oligoglucoside sulfates,  
 

isethionates, taurides, sarcosinates, ether carboxylic 
acids, sulfosuccinates, sulfotriglycerides and 

alkyl (ether) phosphates. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the nonionic surfactants used are selected from the group 

consisting of normal-range or narrow-range fatty alcohol 
polyglycol ethers, alkyl phenol polyglycol ethers, mixed 

ethers, amine oxides, sugar esters, sorbitan esters and 
polysorbates. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the detergent ingredients used are selected from the group 

consisting of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal phosphates 
and phosphonates, zeolites, NTA, EDTA, citric acid, 

polycarboxylic acids, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal 
carbonates, sulfates, silicates, borates and citrates, 

starch, sucrose, polydextrose, active oxygen carriers, 
bleach activators, optical brighteners and foam inhibitors. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
drying and granulation are carried out at a wall temperature 

of 100 to 180°C and at a gas-phase temperature of 150 
to 220°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
drying and granulation are carried out in the presence of 

air, inert gas and/or superheated steam.
