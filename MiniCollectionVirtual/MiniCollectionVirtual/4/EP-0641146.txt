<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (10) for inductively melting a quantity 
of metal without a container includes a first induction
 
coil (12) having a plurality of turns (14) defining a 

volume for receiving a quantity of metal (18), the 
first induction coil being adapted to exert a force on 

the metal, a second induction coil (34) having a 
plurality of turns (36) at substantially right angles to 

the turns of the first induction coil, the second 
induction coil being disposed within said volume coaxial 

with the first induction coil. Both the first and 
second induction coils have connecters thereon for 

connecting the coils to at least one power supply for 
energising the first and second induction coils. A 

support (20) is provided for supporting the metal from 
below and has an opening through it. The support 

includes a raised segmented rim (24) around 
substantially its entire periphery. The support is 

maintained at a preselected temperature. In an 
alternate embodiment, structure (38 or 44,46,48,50,52) 

is also provided for imparting rotational motion to the 
support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic suspension melting,
sometimes referred to as MSM, in which metal is melted by electromagnetic
induction without the need for a crucible. Instead, a magnetic field is used
to contain the melt.In the manufacture of metal castings it is important to avoid
contamination of the metal with non-metallic inclusions. These inclusions are
usually oxide phases, and are usually formed by reaction between the metals
being melted and the crucible in which they are melted. It has long been an
aim of metal casters to avoid such contamination by using crucibles which
have minimum reactivity with the melts. However, some alloys, in particular
nickel-based superalloys, which may contain substantial amounts of aluminum,
titanium, or hafnium, react vigorously with oxide crucibles and form inclusions
during melting.Heretofore there have been two main methods of avoiding
contamination from a crucible in metal smelting. One method is "cold-crucible"
melting, in which a water cooled copper crucible is used. The metal
charge, which may be melted by induction, electric arc, plasma torch, or
electron beam energy sources, freezes against the cooled copper crucible wall. 
Thereafter, the liquid metal is held within a "skull" of solid metal of its own
composition, and does contact the crucible wall.Another method is levitation melting. In levitation melting, a
quantity of metal to be melted is electromagnetically suspended in space
while it is heated. U.S. Patent No. 2,686,864 to Wroughton et al. and U.S.
Patent No. 4,578,552 to Mortimer show methods of using induction coils to
levitate a quantity of metal and heat it inductively.Cold crucible melting and levitation melting necessarily consume
a great deal of energy. In the case of cold-crucible melting, a substantial
amount of energy is required merely to maintain the pool of molten
metal within the skull, and much of the heating energy put into the metal
must be removed deliberately just to maintain the solid outer portion. With
levitation melting, energy is required to keep the metal suspended. In addition,
as compared to the surface of a molten bath in a conventional crucible,
levitation melting causes the quantity of metal to have a large surface area,
which is a source of heat loss by radiation. Additional energy is required to
maintain the metal temperature.For alloys which are mildly reactive with crucibles, such as the
nickel-base superalloys referred to above, a process called the "Birlec" process
has been used. This process was
