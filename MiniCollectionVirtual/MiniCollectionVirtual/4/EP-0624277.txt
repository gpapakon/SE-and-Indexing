<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to insulating coaxial electric 
signal cables, particularly to those cables having a porous 
insulation, most particularly to those cables wherein the 
porous insulation comprises a fluorocarbon polymer. Low-density porous expanded polytetrafluorethlene 
(PTFE), described in U.S. Patents 3,953,566, 3,962,153, 
4,096,227, 4,187,390, 4,902,423, and 4,478,665, has been 
widely used to insulate electrical conductors to provide 
insulated conductors having improved properties of velocity 
of signal propagation, dielectric loss, and physical 
dimensions as compared to conductors insulated with full 
density polymer insulation. The high pore volume and low-density 
provide polymer insulation. The high pore volume 
and low-density provide the improvements in the properties. EPO387796 describes an insulated electric wire having 
an innermost insulating layer of a foam comprising expanded 
microspheres. A second outer insulating layer of a polymer 
material is proposed. US 5,037,999 describes a coaxial 
cable in which the central conductor is surrounded by a 
microporous polymer insulation layer. The microporous 
polymer layer is further wrapped in a polymer tape. 
EP0205268 describes an electrical transmission line in 
which the centre conductor is surrounded by a porous 
plastic dielectric layer which in turn is surrounded by a 
plastic dielectric sheath. A limitation to achieving extremely high signal 
propagation velocity through such insulated conductors lies 
in the open cell (nodes and fibrils) nature of ePTFE which 
is not inherently crush-resistant when it is manufactured 
to have a very high void content or pore volume to achieve 
low-density and low dielectric constant and therefore high 
velocity of signal propagation. Crushability of such an insulation can be improved by  
 
enclosing the insulation with a skin of thermoplastic 
polymer, but the velocity of signal propagation is reduced 
by the solid voidless insulation skin. Another method for providing crush-resistance to the 
cable insulation has been to foam thermoplastic polymers as 
they are being extruded around the conductor to yield a 
crush-resistant closed cell foam insulation around the 
conductor. The method is well known in the art and 
described in U.S. Patents 3,072,583, 4,711,811, and 
4,394,460 and in EP0442346 in which a foaming gas or liquid 
is injected into a molten polymer during extrusion. In 
these methods a foaming agent is used during the extrusion 
process to yield closed cell fluorocarbon polymer
