<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control and regulating apparatus in particular for boilers, consisting of a pivotably mounted housing (1) with adjusting and display elements arranged in its visible-side front face (4). In order to be able to install such an apparatus directly on a boiler without lateral pivoting base, for the purpose of direct cable introduction, but nevertheless at the same time to ensure an adjustment of the front face which is favourable in terms of viewing, according to the invention the housing (1) of such an apparatus is formed from a housing lower part (2) and from a second housing part (3) which is in the form of a sector of a circle cross-section, comprises the front face (4) and can be pivoted into and out of said housing lower part, limited by stops, in the manner of a barrel of a telescope.

Regulating and control system for boilers, comprising a swivably arranged housing 
(1) with setting and display elements disposed in the visual front face (4) thereof, 

characterized in that the housing (1) forms a second housing portion (3) constituting a 
housing bottom (2) provided with a horizontal base or mounting face (9), which is 

retractable into and withdrawable from the latter in a tube-type manner to be limited by a 
stop means, and in cross-section, in a direction vertical to the swivelling axis, is in the 

form of a circular sector, with the upper and lower edges (5) of the hole (6) of action 
provided within the housing bottom (2) conforming to the arcuate shape of the upper 

and lower closing faces (7) ofthe second circular sector-type housing portion (3), and 
that the hole of action (6) is provided in a plane (E) extending at an angle of less than 45° 

relative to the base or mounting face (9) of the housing bottom (2), and that the arcuate 

length of the upper closing face (7) is at least 45°. 
A system according to claim 1, characterized in that a sealant is provided in the gaps 
between the hole edges of the housing bottom (2) and the closure faces (7) and the 

circular sector-type side walls (7') ofthe housing portion (3). 
A system according to claim 2, characterized in that the sealant (8) is in the form of a 
polyamide-flocculated flange band. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the housing 
bottom (2) is provided with a removable lid (10).
