<ABSTRACT>
A Ni-Ti superelastic alloy demonstrates superelastic properties 
at normal temperatures from about 0 and 30°C. The superelastic alloy 

allows shape alteration when the temperature is in excess of 40°C. The 
Ni-Ti superelastic alloy is produced by plastic working a composition 

containing essentially Ni and Ti, and subjecting the composition to heat 
treatment at a temperature between 600 and 800°C to impart shape 

memory. When the Ni-Ti superelastic alloy is used in an eyeglass 
frame, it allows the shape of the pad arms to be adj
usted at 
temperatures above about 40°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
an eyeglass frame in which a pad arm produced from a
superelastic alloy such as Ni-Ti superelastic alloy, is adjustable to
conform to the user's face.In general, articles produced from a superelastic alloy such as Ni-Ti
superelastic alloy, have the benefit of superelastic properties when
stress applied to the articles produces strain. Because of stress-induced
martensitic transformation, the articles return virtually to their original
shape following removal of the applied stress, even when there is a large
deformation beyond the yielding point.Stress-strain characteristics of an alloy depend upon the
conditions of heat treatment following cold work. These characteristics
can be represented by stress-strain charts. For example, referring to
Figs. 1a and 1b, the two charts illustrate characteristics of alloys
subjected to heat treatment in the temperature ranges of 400-500°C and
200-350°C, respectively.Various uses for such superelastic alloys have been described in
the prior art, as well as methods of production. Among such items are
eyeglass frames, and their component elements. For example, U.S.
Patent 4,772,112 and U.S.Patent 4,896,955 both disclose methods of
producing a bridge, a temple, and a pad arm to support a nose pad of
an eyeglass frame. The superelastic alloy in the prior art is produced
from a Ni-Ti alloy by plastic working with a working rate of at least 30
%. This is followed by heat treatment for more than one hour at a 
temperature of less than 400°C. The alloy produced demonstrates
superelastic characteristics over a broader temperature range that of this
invention, ie. from -20 to 80°C.Each of the various parts of an eyeglass frame, particularly a pad
arm, requires adjustment to properly conform to the user's face.
However, the prior-art pad arm, as disclosed in the previously
referenced patents, is difficult to adjust because of its broad
temperature range of superelasticity. For example, a pad arm deformed
at a temperature of 100°C to produce about 4 % strain, returns to its
original shape upon relieving the applied stress. Strain in excess of
10 % is required to alter the shape as desired. This degree of strain
may cause not only the pad arm to break, but also the eyeglass frame
itself and the joint portion between the eyeglass frame and the pad arm.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an
eyeglass frame which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art.Briefly stated, a Ni-Ti superelastic alloy demonstrates superelastic
properties at
