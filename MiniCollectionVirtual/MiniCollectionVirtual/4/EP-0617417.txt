<ABSTRACT>
A rotary actuator has first magnetic field 
generating means (114) for generating a first magnetic 

field; and second magnetic field generating means for 
generating a second magnetic field which interacts with 

the first magnetic field to generate a rotational 
force. A rotary body (105), to which said second 

magnetic field generating means (110) is fixed, has a 
rotational axis at a center thereof, is axially 

supported to be rotatable about the rotational axis, and 
is rotated by the generated rotational force, said 

rotary body (105) having a first moment of inertia about 
the rotational axis, which is substantially equal to a 

second moment of inertia about a central axis of said 
second magnetic field generating means (120).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
driving an objective lens and, more particularly, to an 
actuator apparatus for moving an objective lens along a 
direction crossing a tracking guide of an optical disk. In a system for optically recording information on 
an optical information recording medium such as an optical 
disk or an opto-magnetic disk and reproducing the 
information from the recording medium, i.e., an optical 
disk system, focus servo is operated to maintain an 
object lens in a focusing state, a light beam is focused 
on an optical disk by an objective lens, and a desired 
tracking guide on the optical disk is accessed. In 
addition, tracking servo is operated to maintain the 
objective lens in a tracking state, and a desired track, 
i.e., a tracking guide or an array of tracking guides is 
traced by a light beam. In a state wherein the objective 
lens is maintained in the focusing and tracking 
states, a light beam is intensity-modulated to record 
information on the optical disk, and light which is 
reflected by the optical disk and returns through the 
objective lens is detected to reproduce information. The optical disk system described above comprises 
an optical head apparatus comprising a mechanism for 
moving the objective lens along its optical axis, i.e., 
a focus direction, and along a direction perpendicular 
to the optical axis, i.e., a direction crossing the  
 
tracking guide so as to attain focus servo and tracking 
servo. The optical head apparatus is classified into a 
linear type apparatus for linearly moving the objective 
lens along a direction perpendicular to the optical axis 
and a rotary type apparatus for arcuately moving the 
objective lens along a radial direction crossing the 
tracking guide. The linear and rotary type apparatuses 
have both merits and demerits, and it cannot be determined 
which type is preferable. An optical head apparatus 
of either type is required to achieve access of the 
tracking guide and the tracking servo operation by the 
same mechanism in order to simplify a mechanism of an 
apparatus and to attain high-speed, high-precision 
access and tracking servo. In the optical head apparatus, a lens holder for 
holding the objective lens using a magnetic circuit is 
moved in the radial and focus directions of a disk. 
Upon movement of the objective lens, especially, upon 
access of the tracking guide, a moving position of a 
moving body carrying the lens holder of the objective 
lens, i.e., the position of the objective lens in
