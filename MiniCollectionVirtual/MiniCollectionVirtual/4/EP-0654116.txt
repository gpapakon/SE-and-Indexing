<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder lock and an associated key are described. The lock comprises a rotatable cylinder key plug (102) having a key slot (103) into which the key (200) is insertable. The key has a lower solid base portion with coded side recesses (202) for engagement with side tumblers of the lock. From the solid base portion, a lip projects upwardly at a transversal distance from the rest of the key blade, and the side recesses extend partially through the lip and partially through the solid base portion. The key slot has a corresponding cross-sectional profile with a downwardly projecting tongue (109).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cylinder lock and key combination 
according to the preamble 
of the main claims. Such a combination is known from SE-B-7906023-2 (GKN Stenman 
AB) or DE-C-3 542 008, wherein a side shelf at the upper side of the solid base 
portion of the key blade is substantially perpendicularly oriented 
relative to the main plane of the key blade. Side recesses 
extend downwards from the side shelf for engagement with 
essentially circular-cylindrical side tumbler pins, which in 
turn engage with a side bar in the region of the shear line 
between the shell and cylinder key plug of the lock. The side 
recesses form a coded pattern with code shelfs, which define 
certain mutually engaging positions of the key and the side 
tumblers, and transitional portions therebetween, said transitional 
portions being concavely curved in order to enable a 
movable linear contact with the end edges of the side tumblers 
when the key is being inserted into the key slot. The known lock and key system has proven to function very well 
and has come to wide spread practical use. However, the system 
is subject to certain drawbacks, viz.: 
the key is relatively wide and heavy because of the 
solid base portion, which must have a substantial 
height (in the plane of the key blade) in order to 
accommodate a plurality of different levels of the  
 
code shelfs, so that the desired number of code combinations 
can be obtained; the key slot in the cylinder key plug is by necessity 
relatively wide in the total height extension 
corresponding to the solid base portion of the key, 
which will increase the risk of unauthorized manipulation 
of the lock by means of picking tools. Against this background, the object of the present invention 
is to achieve a lock and key combination which eliminates the 
above-mentioned drawbacks and which comprises a more slender 
key and a smaller key slot in the cylinder key plug. This object is achieved according to the 
characterizing features stated in the main claims. As a result of the arrangement with a longitudinal lip, which 
projects upwards from the solid, wider base portion of the key 
blade, this solid base portion can be made lower, i.e. having 
less vertical extension (in the plane of the key blade), since 
the vertical extension of the lip can also be used for the 
coded side recesses. Correspondingly, the cross-sectional area 
of the widened lower part of the key slot will be substantially 
smaller because of the downwardly projecting tongue, which 
fits into the
