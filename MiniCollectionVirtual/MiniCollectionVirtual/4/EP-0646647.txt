<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the preparation of muds used in water cures, according to a process comprising   - mixing of a fluid paste, produced by adding mineral water to an organic/inorganic substrate, with algae and/or thermophile bacteria, more especially those of the sulphur cycle, - ageing, advantageously with stirring, at a suitable temperature, so as to activate the formation of metabolites by the algae and/or bacteria and the impregnation of the substrate,   - recovery of the mixture and treatment thereof.   The muds obtained can be used, in particular, in water cures, in cosmetology and for veterinary applications.

Process for the preparation of thermal muds,

characterised in that
 it comprises the stages of

mixing a fluid paste, produced by adding mineral
water to an organo-mineral substrate constituted by an

argillaceous or loamy material comprising an algal and
bacterial biocoenosis, with sulphur cycle thermophilic

bacteria, and if necessary fresh-water algae or specific
algae from hyperthermal waters,
maturation, under agitation, at an appropriate
temperature, in order to activate the formation of

metabolites by the bacteria, and the algae when they are
used, and impregnation of the substrate,
recovery of the mixture and its treatment.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 Cyanophyceae or Cyanobacteria and/or Chlorophyceae
and/or diatoms are used.
Process according to claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 the algae are added to the fluid paste at the rate
of 0.02 to 0.15 % as dry weight.
Process according to claim 3, 
characterised in
that
 the algae are added at the rate of 0.05 to 0.10 % as
dry weight.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the bacteria added to the fluid
paste are chosen from the bacteria capable of activating

the production of reduced compounds of sulphur from
mineral water sulphates and/or secreting polymers of an

unctuous nature. 
Process according to claim 5, 
characterised in
that
 bacteria of the genus 
Clostridium bifermentans
 are
used.
Process according to claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 the bacteria are added into the reaction vessel at
the rate of 10
6
 bacteria/g of paste.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 sulphates and/or sulphites and
other sulphur derivatives are added, at the rate of 1 to

3 g/kg of paste.
Process according to one of the previous claims,

characterised in that
 the maturation stage is carried out
in aerobiosis, in an open reaction vessel when oxidized

pastes are used.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that
 the maturation stage is carried out
in anaerobiosis, in a closed reaction vessel, when pastes

of a reducing nature are used.
Process according to claim 10, 
characterised in
that
 maturation is carried out at a temperature greater
than 35 to 38°C, for at least 30 days when a


C.bifermentans
 inoculum is used.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 11,

characterised in that
 part of the imbibition moisture is
evacuated from the recovered mud, then the mud is

subjected to a thermal treatment for pasteurisation
purposes, and to conditioning operations.
Process according to one of the previous claims,

characterised in that
 it comprises the addition of algae
obtained by continuous streaming under natural and/or

artificial light of a water constituting a nutritive 
culture medium, at a temperature suitable for the

development of algae, on an inclined culture support.
Process according to claim 13, 
characterised in
that
 the algae strains are sown onto this support or are
carried by the hyperthermal water used, i.e. a mineral

water, the temperature of which is greater than about
45°C.
Process according to claim 14, 
characterised in
that
 the water is supplemented with nitrogenous or
phosphorus nutrients.
Process according to claim 14 or 15,

 with a mineral water at a
temperature of 50 to 56°C, the streaming is effected with

a rate of flow, per linear metre of culture, of 0.1 to
0.5 m
3
/h on an inclined plane of 15 to 20°.
Process according to one of claims 13 to 16,

characterised in that
 the culture support is heated in
order to reduce the drop in temperature in the lower part

of the inclined plane.
Process according to claim 5, 
characterised in
that
 the added bacteria are cultured in a fermentation
chamber, at a temperature of 38°C, accompanied by

stirring, with pH controlled at a value of 6.0 ±0.2.
Process for the preparation of thermal muds,

characterised in that
 it comprises in a single
preparation line the stages described in claims 1 to 18.

organo-mineral substrate imbibed from a mineral water

comprising an algal and bacterial biocoenosis as well as
