<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a vacuum cleaner, there is arranged in an appliance housing (1) a filter (9, 10) which is to be applied by its outer peripheral edge (17) in a sealed manner against an adapted sealing surface (19) surrounding a flow-through opening (7). In order to achieve reliable, effective filtering of the air conveyed by a motor blower (5) into a blowing-out channel (24), the filter comprises a filter element (10) which is enclosed by a peripherally close-fitting frame (9) and is connected thereto in a sealed manner by means of an additional sealing element (15).

<CLAIMS>
Vacuum cleaner having a filter, which is disposed in the appliance housing (1) and 
which with its outer circumferential edge is to be laid flush against an adapted sealing 

face surrounding a through-flow aperture (7) for air conveyed by a motor fan (5) and 
which has, in the region of the through-flow aperture (7), an air-permeable filter 

element (10), characterised in that the filter element (10) is surrounded by a 
continuous, tightly abutting frame (9), which forms the outer circumferential edge (17, 

19) and is connected all round, in a sealing-tight manner to the filter element (10) via 
an additional sealing element (15). 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1, characterised in that the filter element (10) 
consists of a filter disc folded tightly like an accordion, its fold edges (13) being 

oriented alternately in or opposite to the flow direction of the conveyed air and in that 
the sealing element (15) is disposed between the open end edges (11) of the fold 

edges (13) facing in one direction and along the two outer fold edges (13.3) and the 
adjacent frame edge (14). 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the sealing element 
(15) is disposed in a groove (14) of the frame (9) open to the filter element (10) and 

surrounding the same. 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent claims, 
characterised in that the sealing element (15) is formed of an adhesive introduced into 

the groove (14) in a semiliquid state and hardening to a tough-elastic state. 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent claims, 
characterised in that the sealing element (15) is disposed in the region of the fold 

edges (13.1) facing opposite to the direction of air flow. 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent claims, 
characterised in that the frame (9) has, laterally next to the sealing element (15), a 

radially encircling annular flange (17) as an outer circumferential edge, which carries 
a sealing ring (18) which enters into close abutment with the sealing face (19) of the  

 
through-flow aperture (7). 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent claims, 
characterised in that the frame (9) engages with radially inwardly oriented edge strips 

(16) under the fold edges (13.2) facing in the direction of flow. 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent claims, 
characterised in that the frame (9) rests on support webs (23) so as to be centred on its 

side remote from the through-flow aperture (7), these support webs being provided on 
a cover (21) coupled pivotably to the appliance housing (1). 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent claims, 
characterised in that the open end edges (11) of the folds of the filter element (10) are 

adhered with adhesive in a sealing-tight manner to the respectively adjacent wall 
sections (12) of the frame (9). 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 9, characterised in that the end edges (11) 
and/or the wall sections (12) are provided with adhesive before insertion of the filter 

element (10) into the frame (9, 12).
