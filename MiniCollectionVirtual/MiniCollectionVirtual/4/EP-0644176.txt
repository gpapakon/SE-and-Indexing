<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to preparation of compounds which are useful 
as intermediates in preparation of spiro-substituted glutaramide derivatives, 
notably the compound having the approved non-proprietary name 
candoxatril and the systematic name (S)-cis-4-(1-[2-(5-indanyloxycarbonyl)-3-(2-methoxyethoxy)propyl]-1-cyclopentane 
carboxamido)-1-cyclohexanecarboxylic 
acid. This compound is among those mentioned in 
US-A-5192800 as inhibitors of the neutral endopeptidase E.C.3,4.24.11 
enzyme useful in therapy as diuretic agents for the treatment of 
hypertension, heart failure, renal insufficiency and other disorders. A synthesis of this compound which requires resolution of an intermediate is disclosed in 
EP-A-342 850.  Candoxatril may be prepared by coupling the (S)-enantiomer of a 
compound of formula (I): 
wherein R is 5-indanyl or a carboxylic acid protecting group, with cis-4-amino-cyclohexane-carboxylic 
acid benzyl ester, followed by hydrogenation 
to remove the benzyl group. When R is a 5-indanyl group this procedure 
produces candoxatril; when R is another group it may be removed and 
replaced by a 5-indanyl group by conventional methods.  The compound of formula (I) is the (S)-enantiomer of the chiral 
glutaric acid derivative shown and the substantially optically pure 
enantiomer is required for manufacture of candoxatril which is itself an 
enantiomer of a chiral compound. As described in US-A-5192800 (Example 
431 et seq) the (S)-enantiomers of formula (I) may be prepared by 
resolution of its racemate with (1S,2S)-(+)-pseudoephedrine. This 
resolution process is inefficient. The present invention is intended to provide a method of providing 
the (S) enantiomers of compounds of formula (I) by asymmetric 
hydrogenation of a corresponding (E)-allylic ether. According to the invention, there is provided a method of preparing 
the (S) enantiomer of a compound of formula (I): 
or an amine salt thereof, wherein R is 5-indanyl or a carboxylic acid 
protecting group, which comprises hydrogenating an (E)-allylic ether of 
formula (II): 
or an amine salt thereof wherein R is as defined for formula (I), in the 
presence of a stereoselective chiral rhodium or ruthenium biphosphine 
catalyst capable of catalysing said hydrogenation and a protic solvent. R may be a straight or branched C₁-C₄ alkyl group such as a t-butyl 
group. Several chiral biphosphine catalysts containing rhodium or ruthenium 
are known and are either commercially available or may be made by 
methods known in the art. They contain
