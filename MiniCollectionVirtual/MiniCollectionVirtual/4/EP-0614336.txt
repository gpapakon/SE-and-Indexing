<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method of prolonging the shelf life of produce,
such as fruit and vegetables,
and, more particularly, to a method of prolonging the shelf life of produce by first washing
the produce in a heated ultrasonic bath, snap freezing the washed produce in a slurry of
natural byproducts, then drying the produce at ambient temperatures.The freshness of produce is typically defined by the qualities of taste, texture and
appearance. Due to certain physiological effects fruits and vegetables generally begin to
deteriorate and lose their freshness at the time of harvest. Once harvested from the parent
plant, the fruit or vegetable no longer has the immune-like system of the plant to combat
bacteria, fungus and viruses which deteriorate the produce. A substantial percentage of
fruit and vegetable harvests is thus lost due to such deterioration. Because of the
immense size of the produce industry, it would be highly advantageous from an economic
standpoint to preserve harvested produce in a savory, fresh condition for a longer period
of time. Hence, many different methods for prolonging produce shelf life have been
employed, with varying degrees of success.Refrigeration has been the most popular method of increasing the useful life of fresh
fruits and vegetables. By storing produce at a low temperature, it is possible to extend the
freshness by retarding ripening, softening, textural changes and color changes. Lower
temperatures also reduce undesirable metabolic changes, reduce moisture losses, and
prevent undesirable growth on the produce. However, depending on the length of time
the produce is chilled, refrigeration generally adversely affects taste and quality, and in the
case of excessive or extreme chilling, may actually damage the produce due to chilling
stresses. For example, the US-A-2 385 140 relates to a method for
freezing food, in particular vegetables. In this procedure,
the food is fed through a first chamber, whereby the chamber
has a temperature of -2째C (28째F). A spray pipe is provided at
both, the entrance opening and the outlet opening of the
first chamber, respectively, by means of which the food is
sprayed with water. Afterwards, the food is fed into a second
chamber with a temperature of about -20째C (-5째F) and in which
the food is solidly frozen.Another dodument, the EP-A-0 111 590, discloses a process of
preparing frozen fruit or vegetable that is intended to reduce
waste water from plunging and cooling steps. To accomplish
this, the fruit or vegetable is

<CLAIMS>
A method of extending the shelf life of produce, said produce being fruit or vegetable,
comprising the steps of:


subjecting the produce to a snap freeze medium for snap freezing the produce,
wherein the step of subjecting the produce to a snap freeze medium includes maintaining the

produce in the medium for a period of time which is effective to prevent the produce from
freezing;
maintaining the snap freeze medium at a temperature below or
at the freezing point of water; and
transferring the produce from the snap freeze medium, wherein the obtained produce
of extended shelf life is not frozen and is coated with a layer of the snap-freeze medium.
The method according to Claim 1 wherein the snap freeze medium
includes a slurry of non-artificial byproducts, wherein the non-artificial byproducts include

additives selected from the group consisting of sugars, organic fruit acid and acetic acid or
any combination thereof.
The method according to Claims 1 or 2 further comprising the step of
immersing the produce in a heated preconditioning bath prior to the step of subjecting the

produce to a snap freeze medium.
The method according to Claim 3 wherein the step of immersing the
produce in the heated preconditioning bath includes applying a frequency signal in the subsonic

through ultrasonic frequency range to the heated preconditioning bath.
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein
the step of transferring the produce includes transferring the produce from

the snap freeze medium to a drying area for drying and crystallizing a film
of the medium on the outer surface of the produce. 
Produce being fruit or vegetable, obtained by a process of extending the shelf life of the
produce comprising the steps of:


subjecting the produce to a snap freeze medium for snap freezing the produce,
such that the produce is coated with a layer of the medium,

wherein the step of subjecting the produce to a snap freeze medium includes maintaining the
produce in the medium for a period of time which is effective to prevent the produce from

freezing;
maintaining the snap freeze medium at a temperature below or
at the freezing point of water; and
transferring the produce from the snap freeze medium, wherein the obtained produce of
extended shelf life is not frozen and is coated with a layer of the snap-freeze medium.
The produce generated according to Claim 6 wherein the snap freeze
medium includes a slurry of non-artificial byproducts, said byproducts including additives

selected from the group consisting of sugars, organic fruit acids and acetic acid or any
combination thereof.
The produce generated according to Claims 6 or 7 wherein the medium
includes by-products of the produce.
The produce generated according to Claim 6 further comprising the
step of immersing the produce in a heated preconditioning bath prior to the step of subjecting

the produce to a snap freeze medium.
The produce generated according to any one of claims 6 to 9
wherein the step of transferring the produce includes transferring the produce

from the snap freeze medium to a drying area for drying and crystallizing a
film of the medium on the outer surface of the produce.
