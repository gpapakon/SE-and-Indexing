<ABSTRACT>
An amide compound is made by the dehydrative 
condensation of a carboxylic acid with a 7-amino 

cephalosphoranic acid, in the presence of acid. In one 
process the amide compound is a 7-substituted amino-3-­

substituted methylcephem carboxylic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process 
for preparing amide compounds, which are utilizable for 
production of 7-substituted amino-3-substituted 
methylcephem-carboxylic acids useful as drugs such as 
antibiotics, or intermediates thereof. It is known from JP-A-142987/1985 that amide compounds can 
be prepared by reacting 7-aminocephalosporanic acids and carboxylic 
acids in the presence of a dehydration condensing agent for 
example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. However, the yield of 
this process is poor. It is therefore desired to improve the process 
described above and develop one which can produce highly 
pure amide compounds in a simple manner in a high yield, 
and which should threfore be of industrial importance. As a result of extensive investigations to solve 
the foregoing problem, the present inventors have found 
that the object can be achieved by reacting 7-­
aminocephalosporanic acid or derivative thereof with a 
carboxylic acid in the presence of a dehydration condensing 
agent and acid or acid complex. As the dehydration condensing agent, any compound 
conventionally used for amidation may be used; for 
example, carbodiimides of the formulas R¹ - N = C = N - R² 
may be used, wherein R¹ and R², which may be the same or 
different, each represents an alkyl group having 1 to 5 
carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6 to 10 carbon atoms or  
 
an aralkyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl 
group having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, any of which may 
optionally be substituted. The acid or the acid complex may be a sulfonic acid 
represented by formula: R³SO₃H, wherein R³ represents a hydroxy group, 
an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6 to 10 
carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 6 to 10 carbon 
atoms or a aralkyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms, which 
may optionally be substituted, a halohydrogenic acid HX 
wherein X represents a halogen atom, a Lewis acid or a 
Lewis acid complex. Example of the Lewis acid inolude halogen 
compounds of aluminium, tin, zinc, boron or titanium. 
Examples of the Lewis acid complex include dialkyl ether 
complexes with diethyl ether, di-n-propyl ether, di-n-butyl 
ether, etc.; fatty acid complexes with acetic acid, 
propionic acid, etc.; nitrile complexes with 
acetonitrile, propionitrile, etc.; carboxylic acid ester 
complexes with ethyl acetate, etc.; phenol complexes with 
phenols, etc. When a reaction solvent is used, this may 
be, for example, a halogen-containing organic solvent such 
as dichloromethane,
