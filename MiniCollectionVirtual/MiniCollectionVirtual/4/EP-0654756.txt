<ABSTRACT>
Drive roller (1) for X-Y plotters, cutters and the like for driving 
sheet material (4), pinched betweed said drive roller and at least one 

pinch roller (5), to be moved to and fro, provided with a number of 
blunted wedges which may be arranged in rows in parallel with the axis 

of said drive roller, said blunted wedges having a flat top surface 
which is preferably rectangular with the longest side of the rectangular 

extending in the direction of said axis of said drive roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a drive roller for the friction feed of
(X-Y) plotters, cutters and the like for driving sheet material
in cooperation with at least one pinch roller,
the axis or axes of said pinch rollers being aligned and arranged in
parallel with the axis of said drive roller (the Y-direction), the
surface of which being provided with a plurality of projections each having the
shape of a truncated wedge, for
engaging said sheet material without slippage thereof.A drive roller of this kind is known from JP-A-3-13449,
wherein an X-Y plotter is disclosed of the type which moves a recording
paper with no perforation by drive rollers and pinch rollers. A plurality
of sharp projections is arranged on the outer surface of each of
the drive rollers, such as to enable an exact feeding of the paper
without any slippage. These projections are formed by cutting in the
outer surface of each drive roller with V-grooves parallel and orthogonal
to the shaft of the drive rollers. The projections have sharp tops,
which are pressed against the paper to form holes or micro-apertures
therein. By moving the paper to and fro, these holes are gradually
enlarged which adversely affects the reliability and accuracy of the
movement and position of the paper.The invention is characterized in that the dimensions of the substantially flat top
surface of the wedges are different in the X- and Y-direction, whereas the
dimension extending in the direction of the axis of the roller (the Y-direction)
is substantially larger than that in a direction perpendicular thereon
(the X-direction), so that the flat top surface of each projection is rectangular.The advantage is, that a far bigger grip surface is obtained as a
result of which the pressure on this surface is smaller and the sheet
material is less subjected to deformation caused by the high grip forces,
whereas tracking is considerably improved.Where in this application is spoken of grip surface, the plane
perpendicular to the plane of the sheet material in the direction of
the axis of the drive roller is meant and being gripped by said drive
roller. The advantage of the rectangular shape of the top surface of the wedges is the easier way of
manufacturing and a better tracking.In a further embodiment of a drive roller according to the invention,
the wedges are arranged in rows extending in the direction of the
axis of the roller (the Y-direction) as the case may be at equal distances
of one another and in the circumferential direction in planes
perpendicular to said
