<ABSTRACT>
A rail scanner is proposed on a wheel flange lubrication device for scanning the running of the wheel flange of the rail vehicle on the rail (2), the pulse transmitter of which rail scanner which has the purpose of triggering lubrication pulses is an optical scanning device (3), preferably in the form of a photoelectric barrier which is evaluated in combination with an acceleration transmitter and/or angle of inclination transmitter and/or displacement sensor by an electronic control system.

<CLAIMS>
Wheel flange lubricating system for rail vehicles for
spraying lubricant onto the wheel flanges, with an

electronic control unit which triggers the lubrication
pulses and comprises a pulse generator and which operates

as a function of distance and/or arc and/or time,
characterised in that the pulse generator for triggering

the lubrication pulse is an optical scanner, in the form
of a light barrier (12), whose signal in combination with

an acceleration sensor and/or tilt angle sensor and/or
distance sensor is evaluated by the electronic control

unit (4).
Wheel flange lubricating system according to claim 1,
characterised in that attached to the rotating rim (5) of

the corresponding wheelset (1) of the rail vehicle as the
pulse generator is an infrared transmitter/receiver unit

(12) whose light barrier is set so that, when the wheel
(1) starts moving, reflection of the light barrier on the

rail (2) takes place and can be used to trigger a
lubrication pulse.
Wheel flange lubricating system according to claim 1
or 2, characterised in that the pulse generator is

mounted on the rotating rim of the rail vehicle so that
it can be adjusted vertically and transversely to the

rail (2).
