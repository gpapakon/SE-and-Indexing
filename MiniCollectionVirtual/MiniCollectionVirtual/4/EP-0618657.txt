<ABSTRACT>
To produce an automatic triggering circuit, a current mirror is made up, in the branches of which cells are placed in cascade, equipped with a floating-gate detection transistor. The floating gates of these transistors are charged in different ways, so that the circuit reacts as a function of the value of the difference in these charges. It is then shown that this reaction is independent, on the one hand of the process for fabricating the integrated circuit, and on the other hand on the operating conditions in terms of temperature or power supply voltage. This device is more particularly applicable to the field of chip cards.

Automatic triggering circuit, particularly for re-zeroing, 
comprising a voltage comparator receiving a 

first voltage level (Vcc) and producing a variation of 
an output signal (D) when a voltage difference to be 

monitored exceeds a certain threshold (VS), 
characterized by the fact that it comprises: 


a current mirror with two branches (T3, T4), this 
mirror being connected between a continuous 

electrical supply and a mass, each branch 
comprising a current regulating transistor (T3, 

T4), these two transistors being mounted together 
mirror-wise, 
in each of the branches, below the regulating 
transistors, a detection transistor (C1, C2), at 

least one of these detection transistors being a 
floating-grid transistor, 
the two branches being connected, below the two 
detection transistors, to an earth connection 

transistor (T1). 
Circuit according to Claim 1, characterized in that in 
one branch, between the regulating transistor and the 

floating-grid detection transistor, a disconnection 
transistor (T7, T8) is interposed, to enable the 

floating-grid detection transistor to be programmed. 
Circuit according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized 
in that a floating-grid detection transistor is 

provided in each branch, the difference between the  
 

conduction thresholds between the two floating-grid 
transistors (C1, C2) being equal to the threshold of 

the voltage difference to be monitored, in order to 
form a disconnection circuit independent of the 

temperature or of the value of a supply voltage. 
Circuit according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that it comprises a charging pump 

(P1, P2) with limited current flow to program each 
floating-grid detection transistor (C1, C2). 
Circuit according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the floating-grid transistor or 

transistors (C1, C2) is of the EEPROM type. 
Circuit according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it comprises a programming 

circuit (T12, T13, P1, P2) of the floating-grid 
transistor or transistors (C1, C2), provided: 


with a charging pump (P1, P2) for the application 
of a programming voltage; 
with a first circuit (T6) for the application of 
a first reference potential (Vt) to one of the 

floating-grid transistors; 
with a second circuit (T13) for the application 
of a second reference potential to another 

floating-grid transistor, and 
with a third circuit (T9, T12) serving to set up 
the simultaneous programming of the two floating-grid 

transistors.
