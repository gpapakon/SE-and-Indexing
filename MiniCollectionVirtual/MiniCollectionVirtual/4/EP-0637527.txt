<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle antitheft system 
for vehicles including an engine and 
an electronic engine control system. Systems of the aforementioned type currently installed on 
motor vehicles are known to comprise an electronic control system 
for enabling operation of the engine on receiving a user code; an 
antitheft device for receiving the user code and transmitting it to 
the control system; and a user code transmitter carried by the user. 
Failing reception of the correct user code, the control system 
prevents the engine from being started. A major drawback of the 
above system is that, in the event of a fault on the antitheft 
device, the control system, failing to receive the user code, 
prevents the engine from being started even by the owner of the 
vehicle. The French Patent Application FR-A-2 613 933, proposes a 
first solution of this drawback, using means which permits to 
transmit the user code to the control system using a series of 
events effected by the user on internal parts of the vehicle. For  
 
example this events may be an actuation of the accelerator in 
combination with an action on the air conditioner. However, in the solution proposed by the French Patent Application FR-A-2 
613 933, in particular if even in the event 
the user code should become known, it permits startup of the engine 
an unlimited number of times. Moreover the user code normally 
consists in a long binary sequence, thus the transmission of the user 
code to the control system using a series of internal events is very 
complicated. It is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle 
antitheft system enabling the owner of the vehicle to start the 
engine in the event of a fault on the anti theft device, without the 
drawbacks of the systems according to the state of the art. Further aims and advantages of the present invention will be 
disclosed in the following description. The object of the present invention is achieved by the 
subject-matter of claim 1. 
Further advantageous features are defined in the dependent claims. A preferred, non-limiting embodiment of the present invention 
will be described by way of example with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of an antitheft system in 
accordance with the teachings of the present invention; Figure 2 shows an operational flow chart of the Figure 1 
system. Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates a vehicle antitheft system 
for motor vehicles. System 1 comprises: 
an electronic control system

Clearly, changes may be made to system 1 as described and 
illustrated herein. For example, light signals may be used 

for indicating turn-off of the engine and specific operating 
conditions of system 1.
