<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a brake rotor made from 
composites of from 15-80 percent by volume of silicon 
carbide and from 85-20 percent by volume of iron alloy. 
The silicon carbide in the composite imparts a high 
thermal conductivity characteristic to carry away thermal 
energy generated between first and second friction 
surfaces and brake pads located in a caliper during a 
brake application. In an effort to increase the overall fuel 
efficiency for a vehicle, the overall weight of the 
vehicle has been decreasing for a period of time. One of 
the ways that the weight can be reduced is to replace the 
cast iron brake rotor with a brake rotor made from an 
aluminum or other light weight metal. Unfortunately, 
aluminum is not normally resistant to abrasion. As a 
result, when aluminum is used, a wear resistant surface 
coating of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,290,510 
must be applied to the friction engagement surfaces. This 
type of protection for aluminum rotors is adequate for 
some applications as long as the thermal energy generated 
during a brake application is below 900°F or 480°C. 
However, in many instances, the thermal energy generated 
exceeds the melting point of aluminum and as a result the 
rotors become soft. Therefore it is imperative to develop 
a rotor having the capability of conducting thermal energy 
from a wear surface while maintaining good mechanical 
properties such as hardness and strength at high 
temperatures during a brake application. A rotor made from a chromium copper alloy has 
exhibited a thermal conductivity of approximately six 
times greater than cast iron and has exhibited 
satisfactory performance. Unfortunately, the density of 
such chromium copper rotors is also more than 
corresponding cast iron rotors and as a result an increase 
in the overall weight of a vehicle would not improve the 
fuel efficiency as desired.  
 After evaluating many compositions, silicon 
carbide-copper alloy composites as disclosed in copending 
U.S. Patent Application 722,043 filed June 27, 1991, were 
developed for use as a brake rotor. Such silicon 
carbide-copper alloy composite rotors, which have a 
thermal conductivity about one and one-half times cast 
iron and a relative density approximately two-thirds of 
cast iron, would perform in an adequate manner for most 
brake applications. Since cost of materials is an important 
consideration in the manufacture of a brake rotor, we have 
discovered that an iron alloy/silicon carbide metal matrix 
composite also has a higher
