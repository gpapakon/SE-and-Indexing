<DESCRIPTION>
 GOLF CLUB HEADSThe present invention relates to the head structure of golf clubs, particularly golf irons.There are several clubs in a set of irons, each one designed in terms of shaft length, head weight, head weight distribution, swing weight, loft and lie, to confer certain playing characteristics. An object of the present invention is to improve the performance characteristics of golf irons.According to one general aspect of the present invention, in a set of golf iron heads, at least part of the striking face of each head is of material selected for characteristics desired for the particular iron in the set and at least some of the heads are multi-component heads in which at least part of the striking face area of the head comprises at least one face-piece component of material having at least one characteristic different to the rest of the head.According to the present invention also there is provided a multi-component golf iron head in which at least part of the striking face area of the head comprises at least one face-piece component, said face-piece component(s) being: (a) of material selected for its surface friction and/or flexural modulus characteristics affecting the spin behaviour of golf balls when struck by the head, and/or (b) of specific gravity and/or geometric configuration selected to contribute to the desired weight distribution in the head.When only part of the striking face comprises at least one face-piece component, normally the outer surface of the face-piece component(s) will be level with the adjacent surface of the striking face and normally the face-piece component(s) will be located at least at the normal position of impact with a golf ball by a competent golfer such as at least at the "sweet spot" area, usually the central area, of the striking face. 

 The head may have a main body, or core, of one or more components, and a face-piece of one or more components attached or attachable thereto.By means of the present invention it is possible to optimise playing characteristics and, by careful selection of components, confer a range of performance attributes to suit a wide variety of golfers and playing conditions.Some clubs are designed primarily for distance and some primarily for control. These characteristics can be enhanced by careful selection of the material(s) and geometric configurations of the face-piece.Since the face-piece component(s) can be selected to have characteristics which are independent of the properties desired for the rest of the head, the

CLAIMS :
1. In a set of golf iron heads, characterised in that at least part of the striking face of each head is of material selected for characteristics desired for the particular iron in the set and at least some of the heads are multi-component heads in which at least part of the striking face area of the head comprises at least one face-piece component of material having at least one characteristic different to the rest of the head.
2. A set of golf iron heads according to Claim 1 wherein the one or more face-piece components are selected to provide friction and/or flexural modulus characteristics on a graduated scale through the set, the friction and/or flexural modulus of the face-piece component material being lowest for the long-distance irons and highest for the short-distance irons.
3. A set of golf iron heads according to Claim 1 or 2 comprising heads having a face-piece component whose specific gravity increases through the set from the long-distance irons to the short-distance irons.
4. A set of golf iron heads according to any of the preceding Claims comprising heads having a face- piece component of specific gravity lower than that of the rest of the head and wherein the thickness of the face-piece component increases in the toe to heel direction of the head for at least one of the long-distance irons and increases in the heel to toe direction of the head for at least one of the short- distance irons.
5. A set of golf iron heads according to Claim 1 and substantially as described herein.
6. A multi-component golf iron head in which at least part of the striking face area of the head comprises at least one face-piece component, characterised by said face-piece component(s) being: (a) of material selected for its surface friction and/or flexural modulus characteristics affecting 


 the spin behaviour of golf balls when struck by the head, and/or (b) of specific gravity and/or geometric configuration selected to contribute to the desired weight distribution in the head.
7. A golf iron head according to Claim 6 comprising a face-piece component of material having a specific gravity lower than that of the rest of the head.
8. A golf iron head according to Claim 6 or 7 comprising a face-piece component having a thickness which increases or decreases in the top edge to sole direction of the head.
9. A golf iron head according to any of Claims 6 to 8 comprising a face-piece component having a thickness which increases or decreases in the heel to toe direction of the head.
10. A golf iron head according to any of Claims 6 to 9 comprising a face-piece component having a multi-layered construction.
11. A golf iron head according to any of Claims 6 to 10 comprising a face-piece component attached to the main body by secure means including mechanically interlocking complementary formations.
12. A golf iron head according to any of Claims 6 to 11 comprising a face-piece component attached to the main body in a manner to be detachable therefrom when required.
13. A golf iron head according to Claim 6 having one or more face-piece components substantially as described herein with reference to or as shown in any of the accompanying drawings.
14. A golf iron head according to Claim 6 substantially as described herein with reference to or as shown in any of Figures 3 to 21 of the accompanying drawings.
15. A golf iron head according to Claim 6 and substantially as described herein.
16. A golf iron head according to any of Claims 6 to 15 in a set of golf iron heads.
