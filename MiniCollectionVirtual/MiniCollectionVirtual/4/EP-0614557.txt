<DESCRIPTION>
 CHARACTER RECOGNITION METHODFIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of recognizing characters. The term "character" is used herein in its broadest meaning, to include. not only conventional alpha-numeric characters, but also various symbols, such as mathematical, scientific, phonetic, shorthand, etc., symbols. The method of the present invention is particularly useful for recognizing handwritten characters in real-time, and is therefore described below with respect to this application.Many character recognition methods have been described in the literature for recognizing both pre-printed characters off-line and handwritten characters on-line. A good review of the previously proposed methods is described in the article "The State of the Art in On-Line Handwriting Recognition" by C.C. Tappert, C.Y. Suen, and T. Wakahara, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 12, No.8, August 1990, Pages 787-808. This article lists 286 prior publications as references.OBJECTS AND BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Main Object of the InventionThe main object of the present invention is to provide a new method of character recognition which has a number of important advantages making it particularly useful for on-line recognition of handwritten characters, although various aspects of the method could also advantageously be used for off-line recognition of pre-printed characters. Main Features of the Invention According to a broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of recognizing a character, comprising the operations: (a) measuring the angle of the tangent to the character at each of a plurality of sample points on the character; (b) assigning those points having a tangent direction within a predefined angle 

 from the vertical axis with identifications indicating Up and Down (U,D) point tangent directions (PTDs), and those points having a tangent direction within a predefined angle from the horizontal axis with identifications indicating Left and Right (L,R) PTDs; (c) determining those sample points in which the tangent direction changes from a U,D,L,R value to another U,D,L,R value with respect to the tangent direction of the preceding sample point (which has a U,D,L,R value), and identifying such sample points as special points; (d) arranging the special points according to predefined rules; (e) and utilizing the resulting arrangment of special points for recognizing the character.In the preferred embodiment of the invention
