<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the invention is a device for separating supernatant, 
in particular liquid pollutant, e.g. oil and the liquid, e.g. water, 
comprising a receiving tank and a separating tank, said receiving 
tank being suitably built together with said separating tank, said 
separating tank being divided into a liquid pollutant chamber and a 
clean liquid chamber, while said receiving tank being divided into a 
polluted liquid space and a clean liquid space, said clean liquid 
space and said polluted liquid space being detached from each 
other but as communicating vessels being still in connection, 
likewise said clean liquid chamber and said liquid pollutant 
chamber being detached from each other but as communicating 
vessels being still in connection, said clean liquid space, said clean 
liquid chamber and said liquid pollutant chamber being provided 
with overflow holes, while said polluted liquid space being 
provided with an overflow hole and an inflow gate, too. Polluted liquids, e.g. waste waters with oil and fat contents occur in 
many fields of the industry. In the petroleum refining during the 
crude oil production, transportation and processing, in the steel 
and metal industry among others in the rolling mills, during the 
power production in the power stations, furthermore in the 
chemical plants, in the machine manufacture, at the petrol stations 
and in many other fields there are oil waste waters of different 
contamination.  
 The purpose of cleansing water polluted by oil to protect the 
environment for these waste waters are dangerous for the 
limpidity of the waters, and for the nature. Owing to their great 
migration ability and long decompostion rate they are ineffective to 
the soil, getting into the groundwater. Another purpose of the cleansing is to recover the pollutants for 
recycling or in a given case to neutralize them, moreover to 
recuperate the expensively produced and clarified water. A number of methods and devices are known to clarify polluted 
waters. Their common feature is that they generally operate upon 
the principle of the different specific weights of the water and the 
pollutant. The pollutant in the water is first floated onto the top 
then the surface layer is removed either by a weir or by a device 
working on the principle of the adhesion. The devices of longitudinal through-flow, the oil catchers of 
tangential input and the shallow settling pools with discs, pipes or 
bundles of tubes are widely spread. A common imperfection of the above methodes and

said polluted liquid spece/1/ has a self-adjusting weir/8/, the bottom 

level of said overflow hole/11/ of said liquid pollutant chamber/3/ is 
under the lowest level of said self-adjusting weir/8/ of said polluted 

liquid space/1/, the level of said overflow hole/12/ of said clean 
liquid chamber/4/ is under the bottom level of said overflow 

hole,/11/ of said liquid pollutant chamber/3/, while the level of said 
overflow hole/9/ of said clean liquid space/2/ is practically on the 

lowest level of said self-adjusting weir/8/ of said polluted liquid  
 

space/1/, said liquid pollutant chamber/3/ of said separating 
tank/22/ is adjacent to said polluted liquid space/1/ of said receiving 

tank/21/, and said self-adjusting weir/8/ is located along the 
partition wall/15/ between them. 
A device according to claim 1 
characterized
 in that said 
receiving tank/21/ is flanked by said liquid pollutant chamber/3/ 

and said clean liquid chamber/4/ of said separating tank/22/, and 
said clean liquid chamber/4/ extends under or beside said receiving 

tank/21/, too. 
A device according to claim 1 
characterized
 in having a 
canal/19/ suitable to conduct said polluted liquid, the united block 

of said receiving tank/21/ and said separating tank/22/ is built into 
said canal/19/ itself and divides said canal/19/ into two 

branches/20a, 20b/, said inflow gate/7/ is reduced by deflectors/16/,
