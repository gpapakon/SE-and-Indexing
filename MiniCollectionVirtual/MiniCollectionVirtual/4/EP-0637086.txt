<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
fabricating a semiconductor device by selectively controlling
the growth of an epitaxial layer without a
mask by irradiating a main surface of a substrate
having a difference in level with light during the
growth of a semiconductor layer by vapour phase epitaxy.
The present invention also relates to a semiconductor
device fabricated by the method.A light-emitting diode, a semiconductor
laser, an FET (Field Effect Transistor), and a HEMT
(High Electron Mobility Transistor), and the like are
more and more miniaturized in size and shape so as to
meet the demands in recent years for the devices to
have higher efficiency and a higher operation rate.
Under such conditions, a selective growth technique
for growing a semiconductor by vapour phase epitaxy
becomes important in order to form devices having a new
structure or improve the performance of the devices.In recent years, there has been an increasing
interest in, as one of the selective growth techniques,
a technique for controlling a crystal growth of a
semiconductor by radiating light having a predetermined
exposure pattern from the outside while the semiconductor
layer is grown by vapour phase epitaxy so as to
three-dimensionally selectively excite an epitaxial
layer with light. If the light is radiated on the
surface of the substrate during vapour phase epitaxy, 
the temperature of the surface of the crystal substrate
rises, thereby accelerating the photochemical reaction
of the semiconductor materials or the surface reaction
to incorporate dopants. As a result, the epitaxial
layer excited with light is formed.In such a manner, if a light having a predetermined
exposure pattern is radiated during the vapor
phase epitaxy, differences between the irradiated
portion and the unirradiated portion arise in the
growth rate, the composition, and amount of dopant of
the epitaxial layer. Therefore, the growth of the
epitaxial layer can be selectively controlled without
forming a mask on the substrate.Figure 11 is a vertical sectional view of an
example of a conventional vapour phase epitaxy apparatus
utilizing the selective growth technique with the light
excitation described above. The vapour phase epitaxy
apparatus is composed of an MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical
Vapour Deposition) apparatus provided with a light
source for light excitation. The MOCVD apparatus is
employed for growing a group III-V compound semiconductor
by vapour phase epitaxy utilizing the thermal decomposition
of group III organic gas and group V
