<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to semiconductor
devices, and more particularly, to diode protected semiconductor
devices.Radio frequency (RF) amplifiers, used for example in
telecommunications, are sometimes subjected to severe impedance
mismatches at their output. At radio frequencies, the impedance
mismatch causes significant power to be reflected back into the
output of the RF amplifier. Consequently, the circuits composing the
RF amplifier must be rugged in order to prevent failure in the event
of significant reflected power into the output.Typically, an RF amplifier includes an RF transistor driving the
output. According to industry standards, the RF transistor must be
designed to survive a 20:1 impedance mismatch at its output. A 20:1
impedance mismatch can subject the output of the transistor to up
to four times the supply voltage across the source and drain.
Accordingly, the RF transistor must be designed to resist breakdown
at up to four times the supply voltage.Conventionally, a higher breakdown in an RF transistor is
achieved by lowering the channel doping of the device.
Unfortunately, lower channel doping increases the transistor's on
resistance. A higher on resistance negatively impacts important
parameters such as gain, efficiency, output power, etc.FR-A-2 140 436 describes a single diode scheme for
increasing the breakdown voltage in a transistor, and JP-A-59 044
872 describes a double diode protection scheme for increasing the
breakdown voltage in a transistor.Accordingly, what is needed is a scheme for output impedance
mismatch protection which does not require lowering channel doping.
It would be desirable if the protection could be easily integrated
into existing RF transistor designs.According to the present invention, there is provided a diode
protected semiconductor device as set out in Claim 1. Generally stated therefore, the present invention includes a
transistor having a control terminal, a first terminal and a second
terminal. Additionally, the invention includes a first diode having a
first terminal and a second terminal. The first terminal of the first
diode is electrically coupled to the first terminal of the transistor.
The invention further includes a second diode comprising a first
terminal and a second terminal. The first terminal of the second
diode has the same polarity as the first terminal of the first diode,
and the second terminal of the second diode has the same polarity as
the second terminal of the first diode. The second terminal of the
second
