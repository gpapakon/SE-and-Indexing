<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relating to the sum of the number of error data and the 
possible error data in order to judge whether the data is normal, error or possible error 

and if the sum is in the range of the error correction of the decoder, all the data are 
recognized as erasures, and if the sum is not in the range of the error correction of the 

decoder, only the error data are recognized as erasures. Therefore, the error correction 
decoder according to the present invention is to classify original data and possible error 

data at the erasure which occurred with a high error occurrence rate which is not in the 
range of the error correction of the decoder and effectively decodes by implementing the 

error correction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an error correction code decoder and
a method thereof, and in particular to an error correction code decoder and a method
thereof capable of effectively implementing error correction using a small size decoder
with two kinds of ensures in order to maximize features of the product code.Conventionally, designing a stable circuit capable of sending, receiving and storing
digital data free of errors is extremely costly. Thus, in general, circuits are designed for
permitting some data errors and in compensation for this, the original data is
encoded/decoded by a predetermined algorithm for detecting or correcting the
aforementioned errors. Here, the code in which the original data is encoded is called an
error correction code, and since this error correction code is arranged to be in a certain
order between each of the symbols which is consisting of codes, the errors which might
happen during sending, receiving, storing, or restoring the data are detected or corrected
during decoding. In addition, for detecting/correcting more data errors during decoding,
the code length of the error correction code becomes longer, and the size of the
encoder/decoder which is used becomes larger. Therefore, during designing the circuit,
the error detection/correction capability and the size of the encoder/digital decoder should
be considered. To correct the error during decoding, despite what kind of error correction code
is used, the possible error location(which symbol has the error?) in the received/restored
data and the error size(what is the original value to be obtained?). Therefore, for
error correction, each data needs two equations since each error has two kinds of
information, error location and size.However, depending on circumstances, there may be cases where at least it is
known that the specific symbol of a code is not correct, although the actual value is
known. If for instance the value of the received or restored data is completely
unexpected or if serious noises are mixed, the corresponding value will be unreliable.
This is also a kind of an error, but since the location thereof is known, for computing the
size, only one equation is needed. This is an erasure. Therefore, since the capacity of
error correction of the error correction code depends on how many equations
can be used, in case that the same error correction code is used, if the information of the
erasure may be transferred to the decoder, the total sum of errors which can be corrected
by the decoder

<CLAIMS>
An error correction decoder, comprising:

a first memory (11) for storing a received or
restored original data;
a syndrome calculator (12) for computing a syndrome
value via an operation upon the received or restored data;
a first erasure calculator (13) for computing an
erasure location equation and for counting the number of

flags which indicate normal data;
a second erasure calculator (14) for computing an
erasure location equation and for counting the number of

flags which indicate error data or possible data;
a selector (15) for selecting an output signal of
the second erasure calculator when an output signal of the

second erasure calculator (14) is in a range of error
correction capacity of the decoder and for selecting an

output signal of the first erasure calculator (13) when the
output signal of the second erasure calculator is not in the

range of error correction capacity of the decoder;
an error location/size calculator (16) for computing
an error location equation by operating upon an output

signal of the syndrome calculator (12) and upon information
received from the selector (15) for computing an error size

equation for computing the error location and size from the
computed error location equation and error size equation;

and
result output means (18) responsive to an output
signal of the first memory and the error location/size

calculator, 
for correcting errors in the data stored in the
first memory responsive to an output from the error

location/size calculator,
for outputting a flag indicating one of error-corrected

for outputting a flag indicating errors or
possible errors to the original data when error correction

was not processed.
An error correction decoder according to claim 1,
comprising a second memory (17) for storing the input flags

and delivering said flags to the result output means,
responsive to an output of said selector (15).
An error correction code decoding method,
comprising the steps of:


(a) judging whether a total number of flags,
which indicate errors or possible errors in original data,

is in a range of error correction capacity of the decoding
method by counting the number of flags indicating normal

data and the number of flags corresponding to error or
possible error data;
(b) implementing the error correction by erasing
all flags corresponding to error data and possible error

data when a sun of the flags, which indicate errors or
possible errors, is in the range of the error correction

capacity of the decoding method, and by erasing flags
indicating normal data when the sum of the flags is not in

the range;
(c) outputting flags which indicate that all
data including corrected data are normal when all errors are

corrected; and
(d) outputting flags, which indicate the error
data, and the original data when erasures are recognized but 

errors associated therewith are not corrected, and
outputting flags, which indicate possible errors, and the

original data when each of the data is not recognized as
erasures.
The method of claim 3, wherein step (d) outputs:
flags which indicate errors in the original data by judging

whether original flags of each of the data are errors, when
errors were not corrected; and flags which indicate possible

errors when original flags of each of the data are not flags
of error.
The method of claim 3, wherein step (d) outputs:
flags which indicate possible errors in the original data

when original flags are normal data, by judging whether the
original flags are normal data when errors were not

corrected; and flags which indicate errors in the original
data when original flags of each of the data are not flags

of normal data.
