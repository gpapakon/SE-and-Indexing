<ABSTRACT>
Proximity switches and circumferentially movable stator windings allow a motor-generator (2) to simultaneously sense and switch from a synchronous motor position to a synchronous generator position. The mechanism replaces the conventional separate sensing and switching of motor-generator functions. Automatic rotational repositioning of the stator (21) maintains constant voltage and prevents the generation of transient voltages or harmonics. The stator flux leads the rotor magnetic flux slightly in a motor position. As the stator field weakens due to a failure of the normal power supply, the counter torque also weakens and the stator windings are biased to begin to turn with the rotor (27) until the rotor and stator fields are in step, i.e., when virtually no current is generated or consumed or until a generator position is reached. The dynamic stator may also be used in electric motors or generators to filter or cushion variations in the power supply or in the load.

<DESCRIPTION>
TRANSIENT-FREE SYNCHRONOUS ELECTRICAL POWER MACHINEField of the InventionThis invention relates to rotating electric machines and to electric power generation and use.More specifically the invention relates to a heavy- duty synchronous motors and synchronous generators.Background of the InventionHeavy duty electrical power motors and generators used to drive machinery as primary or back-up electrical power source, and particularly synchronous electrical motors and generators are subject to sudden variations in the magnetic flux between the rotor and stator windings every time there is a phase shift between the rotor armature flux and the stator armature flux. Such phase shift occurs upon sudden increase or decrease in the mechanical load or in the power fed to a synchronous motor, and sudden increase or decrease in the electrical load or the torque applied to a synchronous generator.The sudden phase shift can produce substantial voltage transients that cannot be tolerated by a 

critical load of a generator, or that can be fed back on the line power to a motor.Sensitive loads such as data processing equipment and medical instruments must nowadays be protected by heavy, cumbersome and costly filtering and regulating devices. Utilities must protect their installations against power surges fed back by a motor suddenly turned into a generator by use of circuit breakers and other safety devices which increase the risk of blackouts.The instant invention results from an attempt to limit these undesirable spurious lines transients by attacking the problem at its source, i.e. inside the synchronous power machinery.Uninterruptible power supply systems are provided for switching from a normal line supply of electric power to a standby or backup power supply in the event of interruption, failure or inadequacy of the normal power supply. For true uninterruptible power, the switching must be virtually instantaneous, and for cyclic power, without any change in phase, frequency or voltage. 

 Uninterruptible power supplies may require a transitional supply of power, such as a flywheel, to carry the load until the standby source of power can be brought up to speed and switched on-line. The flywheel may have to be combined with fast acting power loss sensors and solid state switches in order to keep flywheel weight and size reasonable. An example of a fast acting switch is shown in U.S. Patent Number 4,827,152.May of the current uninterruptible power supplies may accomplish the switching quickly, but not without a
