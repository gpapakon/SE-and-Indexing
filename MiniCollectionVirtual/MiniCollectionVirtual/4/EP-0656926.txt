<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the present invention is an aqueous adhesive
composition useful in bookbinding operations and a method for
using this composition in such operations. The adhesive
composition comprises an aqueous polyurethane dispersion or
emulsion alone or in combination with a latex emulsion which
provides increased adhesive structural properties for improved
bookmaking. For example, the adhesive may be used as a primer
or as a structural adhesive in bookbinding.Bookmaking requires the use of a wide variety of adhesives.
Adhesives are used in making hard book covers, casing book
blocks into hard covers, applying paper covers to book blocks,
and the binding of book blocks themselves. The binding of book 
blocks themselves is generally the most demanding adhesive
application in the industry. Adhesives may be used alone or in
cooperation with other mechanical binders such as sewing and
staples.One use of adhesives in binding book blocks is as a primer to
wet the spine area of the book block and provide a tie coat for
an additional adhesive layer. The additional adhesive layer
provides structural support and generally maintains the
mechanical integrity of the binding. Priming adhesives are
generally aqueous emulsions of film-forming polymers which can
readily wet the spine of the book block. The emulsions may be
thermoplastic copolymers, acrylates, animal glues, etc. An
example of a particular primer composition is disclosed in Hume,
III, US. Patent No. 4,536,012. This reference discloses a
significant advance in the art and employs a latex primer
composition which includes ungelatinized starch particles to
form a primer film resistant to blistering and subsequent
charring. The latex primer composition is generally prepared
from such known resins as vinyl acetate-acrylic acid copolymers,
styrene-butadiene copolymers, and ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)
copolyers, etc.Structural adhesives may be either aqueous emulsions or hot melt
adhesives. The aqueous emulsions are primarily EVA's,
polyvinylacetates (PVAc's), or other vinyl copolymers which
incorporate external plasticizers. Hot melts are often
thermoplastic styrene block copolymers or EVA's. An example of
a particular hot melt structural adhesive composition is
disclosed in Malcolm et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,090,861. This
reference also discloses a significant advance in the art and
relates to the use of radial block copolymer, a tackifying
resin, and a plasticizing oil in a hot melt adhesive for
bookbinding. This adhesive has enhanced resistance to cold
