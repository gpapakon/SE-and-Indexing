<ABSTRACT>
An electrical transmission control mechanism (10) for 
shifting a transmission of a machine is provided. The 

control mechanism (10) includes a control assembly 
(14) that has rotational motion. A plurality of 

contactless sensors (54,71) detect the amount of 
rotational movement of the control assembly (14) and 

responsively produce signals that are indicative of a 
desired speed and/or direction of the transmission. A 

coupling arrangement couples the rotational motion of 
the control assembly (14) to the contactless sensors 

(54,71) to isolate the contactless sensors (54,71) 
from mechanical loading that is imposed on the control 

assembly (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a 
mechanism for controlling the operation of a 
transmission, and more particularly to a manually-operated, 
electrical noncontacting control mechanism 
for controlling a transmission. U.S. Pat. No. 4,930,366 issued 05 June 1990 
to V. G. Boucher et al discloses an electrical 
transmission control mechanism that includes a control 
lever for rotating a turret assembly to command 
directional modes of the transmission and a twist grip 
assembly at the distal end of the control lever to 
control speed modes of the transmission. The control 
mechanism additionally includes electrical rotary 
contacting type switching devices that are responsive 
to movement of the turret and twist grip assemblies. Unfortunately contacting electrical switches 
are subject to wear, necessitating switch replacement 
or repair. Thus the long term reliability of such a 
transmission control mechanism is low, which leads to 
high system costs. Moreover when the control 
mechanism is not operating properly, the machine 
cannot be used. This "down-time" imposes unacceptable 
burdens to the machine owner. The present invention is directed to 
overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth 
above. In order to achieve the above, an electrical transmission as set forth in claim 1 is provided. Preferred embodiments of the invention are shown in the dependent claims.  
 For a better understanding of the present 
invention, reference may be made to the accompanying 
drawings in which: 
Fig. 1 is a fragmentary side-elevational 
view of an electrical transmission control mechanism 
constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment 
of the present invention; Fig. 2 is a fragmentary, enlarged top view 
of the control mechanism; Fig. 3 is a fragmentary, enlarged front view 
of the control mechanism; Fig. 4 is a top plan view of the control 
mechanism; Fig. 5 is a side plan view of the control 
mechanism; and Fig. 6 is a block diagram of the electrical 
circuitry associated with the control mechanism. Referring to Figs. 1-5, an electrical 
transmission control mechanism 10 is shown for 
shifting an electronically controlled power shift 
transmission. These transmissions typically include a 
plurality of hydraulically actuated disc-type clutches 
or brakes, and may be of the planetary gear train type 
or the countershaft gear train type. Referring now to Fig. 1, the transmission 
control mechanism 10 includes a stationary lower 
support assembly 12 and a control assembly 14 that is 
mounted on the
