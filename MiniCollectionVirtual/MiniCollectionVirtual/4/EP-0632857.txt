<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to papermaking, 
particularly to a method whereby a suspension of pulp 
and inorganic filler in water is spread over a wire or 
net and the water is removed to form a fiber web or 
sheet. More particularly, the invention relates to 
the addition of anionic polysilicate microgels 
deposited on the surface of cationized starch granules 
to flocculate the 
pulp and filler fines, such that, during the water 
removal step, water removal is easier and fines 
retention is greater, thereby increasing both the 
productivity and yield of the papermaking process. Many additive systems for improving wet-end 
drainage and fines retention are described in the 
prior art. The systems include employing polymers, 
combinations of polymers and polymers combined with 
colloidal silica. The latter systems are among the 
most efficient now in use, but there is a continuing 
need to provide additives with reduced cost and 
improved performance.  
 The invention, as described in the claims, employs, 
as a retention and drainage aid, polysilicate microgels deposited 
on the surface of cationized starch granules, the microgels being formed by the 
partial gelation of an alkali metal silicate or a 
polysilicate such as sodium polysilicate, having in 
its most common form one part Na₂0 to 3.3 parts Si0₂ 
by weight. The microgels, which are referred to as 
"active" silica in contrast to commercial colloidal 
silica, consist of aggregates of very small, e.g., 1 
nm, particles arranged into three dimensional networks 
and chains. They typically have a very high 
surface area, usually greater than 1000 square meters 
per gram (m²/g) and can be used in the papermaking 
process in conjunction with cationic polymers derived 
from natural or synthetic sources. Polysilicate microgels can be formed most 
readily by the addition of an initiator to a solution 
of sodium polysilicate. The initiator starts the 
process of gelation which, if allowed to proceed to 
completion, would result in the total solidification 
of the solution. The gel solidification time, that is 
the length of time for total solidification to occur 
once initiated, the can range from seconds to months 
and depends on a variety of factors including pH, 
silica concentration, temperature and the presence of 
neutral salts. For commercial applications, short gel 
solidification times are preferred. Once initiated, 
gelation is allowed to proceed for about 5% to 95% of 
the gel solidification time before being stopped by 
diluting the polysilicate

<CLAIMS>
A drainage and retention aid for papermaking for adding to an 
aqueous paper furnish containing pulp, characterised in that the aid comprises a 

silicated cationic starch composition which is a dry solid containing from about 1 
to 25 wt% silica and consists essentially of granules of a cationized starch having 

the silica in the form of a water soluble polysilicate microgel deposited on the 
surfaces thereof and, optionally, the composition further containing discreet 

agglomerates of silica microgels in admixture with the silicated starch granules. 
A drainage and retention aid as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
cationic starch is a cationized potato starch. 
A drainage and retention aid as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which 
the polysilicate microgel is deposited randomly about the surface of the starch 

granules.
