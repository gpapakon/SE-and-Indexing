<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a levelling apparatus for attaching to an attachment frame (4) on the front or the rear of a self-propelled vehicle (1) for the preparation of cross-country ski runs, ski pistes or snowmobile trails and also for roughening or breaking up hard snow and layers of ice on footways, roadways or walking paths, comprising a framework construction (20) which is pivotable about a horizontal axis running transversely to the direction of travel, with a front support (29), and a cutting device (40) for cutting open and/or comminuting the covering of snow or ice, a rear support (2) for the framework construction being provided. In the case of the levelling apparatus according to the invention, the framework construction (20) is articulated on the attachment frame (4) or a transverse beam (8), in such a way that the self-propelled vehicle (1) itself forms the rear support of the framework construction (20).

A grading apparatus for front attachment to the 
attachment frame (4) of a drive vehicle (1), 

capable of free movement in respect of its height 
and capable of being firmly secured in respect of 

its inclination angle, for the preparation of ski 
cross-country trails, ski pistes, or snowmobile 

trails, as well as for the roughing or breakup of 
compacted snow and ice on footpaths, vehicular 

carriageways, or hiking trails, including a bracket 
construction (20) capable of swivelling about a 

horizontal axis running at right angles to the 
direction of travel, with a forward support (29) 

and a cutting apparatus (40) for ripping up and/or 
crushing a snow layer, in which a rearward support 

(2) is provided for the bracket construction (20) 
an that the cutting apparatus (40) extends between 

the forward and rearward support,
 
characterized in that 


the bracket construction (20) is linked to the attachment 
frame (4) in such a way as to be swivelled 

about the said axis (53), 
the attachment plane and a basic working position 
of the bracket construction (20) on the attachment 

frame (4) is defined by the position of this swivel 
bearing (53) as well as by a stop element (90-92), 

that the swivelling capacity of the bracket 
construction (20) is limited relative to the attachment 

frame (4) in the basic working position 
due to the stop element (90-92), 
the bracket construction (20) can be retained in 
the basic working position, in respect of its 

swivelling position, under the weight of the attachment 
frame (4) at the said stop (90-92), and 

thanks to the type of attachment of the bracket 
construction (20) to the attachment frame (4), the  

 
bracket construction (20) to the attachment frame 

(4), the drive vehicle (1) can itself form the 
rearward support for the bracket construction (20). 
A grading apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the bracket construction (20) 

includes at least one carrier element (23, 26) for 
the cutting device (40), and carrier elements (22) 

inclined in the direction of travel for the forward 

support (29), connected to one another by longitudinal 
and transverse struts (37, 38). 
A grading apparatus according to one of Claims 1 
or 2, characterized in that the bracket construction 

(20) features a release mechanism (60) for the 
cutting device (40). 
A grading apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the cutting device (40) is 

secured in a releasable manner to the bracket construction 
(20) by means of a yoke beam (20), which 

is essentially U-shaped. 
A grading apparatus according to one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the height (operating 

depth) of the cutting device (40), as well as its 
cutting or digging angle, are adjustable. 
A grading apparatus according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the bracket construction 

(20) is mounted on the attachment frame (4) by 
means of spring or torsion elements (54), which 

exert force on the bracket construction (20) in a 
forwards direction when it is in the rearward pivoted 

state. 
A grading apparatus according to one of Claims 1  
 

to 6, characterized in that the pivoting capacity 
of the bracket construction (20) in respect of the 

transverse beam (8) or the attachment frame (4) 
respectively, is limited in a forwards movement, in 

its basic operating position, by means of at least 
one stop (90, 91). 
A grading apparatus according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the minium of one stop element 

(90, 91) is designed to be elastically resilient. 
A grading apparatus according to one of Claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that the forward support 

(29) is linked to the carriage which is fitted to 
the bracket construction (30). 
A grading apparatus according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that means are provided, for 

example in the form of a rubber covering (33), 
which prevent the carriage (30), at least when in 

the raised state, from tilting downwards to the 
front. 
A grading apparatus according to one of Claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that the forwards support 

(29) is a running wheel (31). 
A grading apparatus according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the carriage (30) can be 

pivoted about a horizontal pivot axis (32) running 
transverse to the direction of travel, that first 

means are provided, for the use of the grading 
apparatus for clearance, to pivot the carriage (30) 

about the pivot axis (32) into a vertical position, 
and hold it in the position into which it has been 

pivoted, and that second means are provided which,  
 

together with the pivoted carriage (30), form a 
plough blade. 
A grading apparatus according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that the first means include a 

pivot lever (207) which is located on the bracket 
construction in such a way as to be capable of 

pivoting, which can be pivoted by means of a 
hydraulic cylinder (208), and one lever arm of 

which is connected to the carriage (30) by means of 
a cable (205), and that the second means include a 

flap (206) which is firmly secured to the pivot 
lever (207), and which, when the carriage (30) is 

pivoted, is also pivoted together with the pivot 
lever (207) into a position in which carriage (30) 

and flap (206) join together and form the plough 
blade.
