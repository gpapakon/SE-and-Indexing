<ABSTRACT>
Electrically conductive tubing (
26
) for realizing induction coils (
24
) 
having improved efficiencies comprises an outer peripheral portion (
28
) of 
conductive material defined by a plurality of side walls (
30
,
32
,
34
) and a single 
hollow passageway (
40
). Each side wall has inner surfaces and outer surfaces 
(
42
,
44
). At least one side wall has a curved outer surface (
42
). The hollow 
passageway (
40
) is defined by the inner surfaces and can be either entered within 
the tubing (
26
) or spaced apart from the center of the tubing (
26
). The present 
invention also defines an induction coil (
24
) and an induction furnace (
10
) having 
an induction coil (
24
) which utilizes such tubing (
26
). The curved outer surfaces 
(
42
,
44
) have radius of curvatures which are defined substantially by a function 
of the tubing width in the axial direction, and spacing between turns of the 

induction coil. The cross section of the outer surface of the outer peripheral 
portion of the tubing taken along a transverse axis of the tubing defines a 

geometric figure. The perimeter of the figure is substantially polygonal with at 
least one curved side wall (
34
).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to conductive tubing and 
to the use of such tubing for fabricating an induction 
coil. The invention is described in the context of, but 
is not limited to, induction heating apparatus. Induction heating apparatus such as induction 
furnaces for heating or melting metals operate on the 
principle of inducing eddy currents in a workpiece 
(sometimes referred to as the load) to be heated. The 
eddy currents cause the load to act as its own heat 
source by the P=I2R heating principle. The eddy 
currents are induced in the load by passing alternating 
current through a generally helical induction coil 
disposed near or around the load. In a "coreless" 
induction furnace, the load is typically disposed inside 
the induction coil, so that the load itself acts as the 
core. Coreless induction furnaces in common use today 
often include induction coils of copper tubing adapted 
to allow a liquid coolant to flow therethrough. The 
copper tubing conducts the alternating current which 
produces the electromagnetic field inside the furnace to  
 
create the eddy currents in the load. Running water or 
other liquid coolant flows through the copper tubing of 
the coil to remove the heat conducted through the 
refractory material and the heat generated by the coil 
current. The efficiency of an induction furnace depends, 
in part, on the amount of energy (in the form of 
electromagnetic energy) which couples from the induction 
coil to the load and is converted into heat energy in 
the load. One overall goal in designing such furnaces 
is to maximise this efficiency. The efficiency is a 
function of many different design parameters. One 
parameter which affects the efficiency is the tubing 
used to fabricate the induction coil. Different tubing 
shapes, sizes and dimensions, when wound into a helical 
coil, will produce different electromagnetic flux 
patterns. Different patterns will cause more or less of 
the electromagnetic energy to couple into the load, 
thereby resulting in greater or lesser furnace 
efficiency. In the prior art, the induction coil tubing 
typically has a rectangular cross-sectional profile with 
a rectangular opening for cooling fluid to flow 
therethrough. The outer side walls of the rectangular 
tubing are typically straight, although sometimes the 
outer concerns may be slightly rounded. Another well-known  
 
form of tubing has a circular cross-sectional 
profile with a circular opening therethrough. It is 
also known to curve the outer surface of the side walls 
such
