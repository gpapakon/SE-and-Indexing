<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for deaerating a liquid in a 
substantially closed liquid circulation system, wherein an 

amount of liquid is withdrawn from the circulation system and 
is introduced into a closed reservoir (1) via a valve (4) which is 

alternately open and closed, wherein by means of a pump (7) which 
is operative in the open as well as the closed positions of 

the valve an underpressure can be created in the reservoir (1) for 
the purpose of deaerating the liquid, and the liquid can be 

sucked from the reservoir (1) and added to the circulation system (8) 
again, separated air being discharged via a vent unit (2) to the 

environment. For the valve (4) adapted to be opened and closed 
alternately, preferably a throttling valve is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for deaerating a liquid
in a substantially closed liquid circulation system, in which
an amount of liquid is withdrawn from the circulation system
and is introduced via a valve into a closed reservoir, by
means of a pump the pressure in the reservoir is reduced for
deaerating the liquid and the liquid is sucked from the
reservoir and added to the circulation system again, and
separated air is discharged via a vent unit to the
environment. This invention also relates to an apparatus for
practicing such method.A method of the type described in the opening paragraph
hereof is known from EP-A3-0 187 683, more specifically Fig. 5
of that publication and the discussion thereof. In this known
method, liquid is added to the reservoir until a level gauge
gives a first signal, which causes the valve to close and the
pump, having been stationary up to that moment, to start
operating. The pumping action creates an underpressure in the
reservoir, so that water is sucked in via a pipe which
branches off from the supply at a point upstream of the valve
and which includes a reducing valve. As the water flows into
the reservoir, it is degassed due to the reduced pressure
condition prevailing there. Due to the action of the pump, the
liquid level in the reservoir falls until the level gauge
gives a second signal, which switches off the pump and opens
the valve. The water to be deaerated now flowing in displaces
the separated air already present in the reservoir via a float 
valve and a non-return valve into the environment. As soon as
sufficient water has flowed through the valve into the
reservoir, the level gauge gives a first signal again, thereby
initiating a next air separation phase. Thus the process
comprises an air separation phase, in which the pump rotates
and the valve is closed, and an air blow-off phase, in which
the pump is stationary and the valve is open. In other words,
the process is a discontinuous process in which various valves
have to be controlled and the pump has to be set in operation
and stopped. This disadvantage is recognized and an attempt is
made to reduce the less desired effect thereof by designing
the level gauge in such a manner that the air separation phase
lasts as long as possible.The object of the invention is to improve a method of the
type described in the opening paragraph hereof in such a
manner that deaeration in fact no longer involves two discrete
phases regulated by a series of control operations, and, in a
manner of speaking, a continuously
