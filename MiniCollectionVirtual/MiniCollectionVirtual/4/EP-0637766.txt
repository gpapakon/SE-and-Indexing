<ABSTRACT>
When twisting an optic cable, using a tube twister (13), the core (11) is fed centrally at the leading end (30) of the twister (13), and moves off centre in sections as it passes through the twister (13). Pref. the core (11) is drawn into the twister (13) from the preceding static supply, pref. a supply pan (23). Supply bobbins (17) for the cable armour strands (12) are centrally within the twister (13), and the core (11) is moved off centre to pass by them. The core (11) is returned to the centre of the twister (13) before the twisting point (21) where it meets the armour strands (12). The core (11) enters and leaves the rotating twister (13) at the centre axis (15) of the rotating tube (14), and parallel to the axis (15) when passing the inner supply bobbins (17), pref. along the outer side of the rotating tube (14) mantle. Guide eyelets (27) hold the core (11) along its off centre path, where it is diverted from the centre. The core (11) stretch is reversed before it reaches the twisting point (21), through pref. a friction drive on the core.

Method of manufacturing optical cables having a
core preferably comprising a plurality of optical

waveguides, the core being sheathed by twisted strands,
in particular reinforcing wires, characterized in that

the twisting takes place on a tube twisting device (13),
which comprises a rotary tube (14) with a central axis of

rotation (15), the core (11) being fed centrally to the
front side (30) of the tube twisting device (13) and

guided off-centre, to be specific in the region of a
circumferential surface of the rotary tube (14), in

certain regions over the course of the tube twisting
device (13).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the core (11) is drawn off from a stationary supply,

in particular from a supply tray (23), arranged upstream
of the tube twisting device (13).
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the tube twisting device has a plurality of

supply rollers (17), lying on the central axis of
rotation (15), and in that, at least in the region of the

supply rollers (17), the core (11) is guided off-centre.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the core (11) is directed back into

the centre of the tube twisting device (13) shortly
before a twisting point (21), at which the core (11) is

provided with the outer strands (12).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the core (11) is directed into the

centre of the tube twisting device immediately after the 
last supply roller (17) of the strands (12) in the

twisting direction (16).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the core (11) is directed towards

and/or away from the tube twisting device (13) along a
central axis of rotation (15) of a rotationally driven,

elongate rotary tube (14) or the like.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that, at least in the region of all the

supply rollers (17) of the tube twisting device (13), the
core (11) is guided substantially parallel to the axis of

rotation (15) of the rotary tube (14), preferably on the
outside of the circumferential surface of the rotary tube

(14).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that, in that region of the tube
twisting device (13) in which the core (11) runs outside

the axis of rotation (15), the core (11) is guided
through directing elements, in particular directing

eyelets (27), arranged at regular intervals on the rotary
tube (14).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that, in that region in which it runs

approximately parallel to the axis of rotation (15) of
the rotary tube (14), the core (11) is guided by

directing elements having greater intervals than in those
zones in which the core (11) is directed away from the

axis of rotation (15) and/or towards the axis of rotation
(15).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that, in a region located before the

twisting point (21), the elongation of the core (11) is
reversed.
Method according to Claim 10, characterized in
that the elongation of the core (11) is reversed in a

region before the twisting point (21) by a preferably
frictional driving of the core.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that a torsion of the core (11) is 

prevented and/or reversed in a region before the twisting
point (21).
Method according to Claim 12, characterized in
that the torsion of the core (11) is reversed by inclined

rollers or the like, which run along, freely rotatably or
driven, in frictional contact with the circumferential

surface of the core (11), the inclined position of the
rollers being such that the core (11) is rotated back

contrary to the direction of torsion about a longitudinal
centre axis.
