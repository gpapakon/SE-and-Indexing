<ABSTRACT>
A shaving apparatus having at least one shaving unit comprising an 
external shaving member (
3
) and an internal shaving member (
4
) which is rotatably 
drivable relative to the external shaving member, the external shaving member having 

an annular wall portion (5) with lamellae (7) which extend in substantially radial 
directions and between which hair-entry apertures are formed, the radial ends (13) of 

the lamellae having a rounding radius (R) of 0.3 - 0.7 mm viewed in a radial direction, 
and the internal shaving member (
4)
 comprising cutters (9) having cutting edges (10) 
which describe a path (11) adjoining the inner side (12) of the annular wall portion (5) 

of the external shaving member. In order to improve the shaving performance the 
shaving apparatus is characterised in that, viewed in radial cross-section, at least a part 

(14) of the outer side of the annular wall portion (5), which part is situated opposite the 
annular path (11) of the cutting edges (10), has an outwardly directed arcuate shape, the 

perpendicular distance (15) between the axially outermost point (16) of this arcuate part 
(14) and a line through those points (18, 19) of the outer side of the annular wall 

portion, which are situated directly opposite the inner diameter (20) and the outer 
diameter (21), respectively, of the annular path (11), being 12-100 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a shaving apparatus of a type having at least one
shaving unit comprising an external shaving member and an internal shaving member
which is rotatably drivable relative to the external shaving member, the external shaving
member having an annular wall portion with lamellae which extend in substantially
radial directions and between which hair-entry apertures are formed, the radial ends of
the lamellae having a rounding radius of 0.3 - 0.7 mm viewed in a radial direction, and
the internal shaving member comprising cutters having cutting edges which engage
against the inner side of the annular wail portion of the external shaving member.Such a shaving apparatus is known from US-A-4,926,550.
The lamellae of the external shaving member of the known apparatus are flat. In order
to ensure that the hairs are effectively caught in the hair-entry apertures it is very
important that the ends of the lamellae have a rounding of a suitable radius. In practice,
it has been found that in shavers in accordance with US-A-4,926,550 the rounding
radius should not exceed 0.7 mm. Another import factor is the shaving sensation,
i.e. the extent to which the shaver feels rough to the skin. The shaving sensation is
influenced by the magnitude of said rounding radius. In practice, a rounding radius of
0.3 - 0,7 mm is found to be favourable with a view to the shaving sensation. A smaller
radius gives an increased sensation of roughness.It is an object of the invention to improve the shaving performance, i.e. to
sever the hairs closer to the skin, whilst the shaving sensation is preserved or even
improved.For this purpose, in accordance with the invention, the shaving apparatus
of the type defined in the opening paragraph is characterised in that, views in a radial
cross-section, at least a part of the outer side of the annular wall portion, which part is 
situated opposite the annular path of the cutting edges, has an outwardly directed
arcuate shape, the perpendicular distance between the axially outermost point of this
arcuate part and a line through those points of the outer side of the annular wall portion,
which are situated directly opposite the inner diameter and the outer diameter,
respectively, of the annular path, being 12-100 µm.It has been found that the shaving performance is influenced by the
contact pressure between the external shaving member and the skin. When an external
shaving member having flat lamellae and a rounding radius of 0.5 mm at the radial ends
of the lamellae

<CLAIMS>
A shaving apparatus having at least one shaving unit comprising an
external shaving member (3) and a internal shaving member (4) which is rotatably drivable

relative to the external shaving member (3), the external shaving member (3) having an
outwardly directed annular wall (5) portion with lamellae (7) which extend in substantially

radial directions and between which hair-entry apertures are formed, the edges (13) of the
annular wall portion (5) having a rounding radius (R) of 0.3 - 0.7 mm viewed in a radial

direction, and the internal shaving member (4) comprising cutters (9) having cutting edges (10)
which describe an annular path (11) adjoining the inner side of the annular wall portion (5) of

the external shaving member (3), characterised in that, viewed in a radial cross-section,
at

least a part (14) of the outer side of the annular wall portion (5), which part (14) is situated opposite
the annular path (11) of the cutting edges (10), has an outwardly directed arcuate shape, the

perpendicular distance (15) between the axially outermost point (16) of this arcuate part (14) and a line
