<ABSTRACT>
A phase lock loop (10) monitors a first digital signal and 
generates a second digital signal operating substantially at 

frequency and in-phase with the first digital signal. A 
programmable divider (30) latches (60) a program integer for 

providing a latch integer, compares (64) the latch integer to a 
constant integer, and generates a flag signal having a first state 

when the latch integer mismatches the constant integer and a 
second state when the latch integer matches the constant integer. 

The latch integer is decremented (62) when the flag signal has the 
first state. The flag signal is delayed in response to first and 

second clock signals for providing the second digital signal having 
a frequency determined by the program integer. The first and 

second digital signals are applied to a lock detection circuit for 
providing a lock detection signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to copending U.S. Patent No.
5278520, entitled "PHASE LOCK DETECTION IN A PHASE LOCK LOOP",
filed by Lanny L. Parker et al and assigned to the same assignee,
Codex, Corp.The present invention relates in general to phase lock loops
and, more particularly, to a programmable frequency divider in a
phase lock loop for extending the pulse width of control signals to
a lock detection circuit.Phase lock loops (PLLs) are found in a myriad of electronic
applications such as modems and clock synchronization circuits for
computer systems. A conventional PLL includes a phase detector
for monitoring a phase difference between an input signal and an
output signal of a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). The phase
detector generates an up control signal and a down control signal
for a charge pump to charge and discharge a loop filter at a loop
node at the input of the VCO. The loop voltage developed across the
loop filter determines the output frequency of the VCO. The up and
down control signals driving the charge pump set the proper loop
node voltage at the input of the VCO to maintain a predetermined
phase relationship between the signals applied to the phase
detector.It is common for the PLL to lose phase lock should the input
signal fade or jump to a different frequency of operation. The out-of-lock
state can be detected with a lock detection circuit and
other system processing suspended until the PLL can re-establish
phase lock. One lock detection scheme monitors the up control
signal and the down control signal at the output of the phase
detector to ascertain the lock status of the PLL. If the up control
signal and down control signal are not pulsing, then loop node 
voltage remains substantially constant and the PLL should be in
phase lock. When the up control signal and the down control signal
are steadily generating pulses charging or discharging the loop
filter to adjust the input voltage of the VCO, the loop must be in
motion and thus out of phase lock.During normal operation, the loop node is continuously
subjected to leakage through the charge pump circuit thus requiring
occasional pulses to maintain the voltage controlling the VCO.
However, these intermittent pulses should not indicate an out-of-lock
condition. The conventional lock detection circuit may include
a delay circuit comprising a string of serially coupled inverters
designed to ignore short intermittent pulses from the phase
detector having less than a predetermined pulse width. The up and
down control signals
