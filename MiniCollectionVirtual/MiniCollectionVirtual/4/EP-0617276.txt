<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for inspecting a pneumatic 
tire casing (100) is described. The inspection method 

includes the steps of aligning a source (60) and a 
detector (70) external of the casing (100), the source (60) 

angularly transmitting a beam across the shoulder 
region of the tire and angularly impinging a portion 

of the casing; rotating the casing about its axis of 
rotation; receiving the beam image of the shoulder 

region of the casing; and observing any separation or 
lifting of the breaker edge of the casing relative to 

the rest of the breaker as displayed onto a screen. 
The preferred apparatus includes a traversable 

assembly (50) which is pivotally and linearly movable, 
an X-ray source (60) and a detector (70) linearly spaced 

along the beam axis of the source (60) and attached to 
the assembly (50), and a means for energizing the 

source.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inspection method 
and apparatus for a pneumatic tire casing. More 
particularly, the invention describes a method to 
detect the lifting or separating of a breaker or belt 
at a lateral edge of the tire casing. An apparatus 
for carrying out the above method as well as 
performing inspection procedures for the entire tire 
structure is also disclosed. Historically the inspection of internal tire 
components has included the use of X-ray apparatus. U.S. Patent No. 3,826,919, assigned to the 
Westinghouse Electric Company, describes an apparatus 
capable of emitting an X-ray beam at different angles 
between the beads into the tire annulus toward an 
exterior X-ray imaging means automatically maintained 
aligned with such beam. The claimed apparatus 
purported to enable complete bead-to-bead inspection 
of the tire without requiring a removal and sidewall 
reversal on the apparatus. The apparatus rotates the 
tire and can spread the beads to facilitate inspection 
of the tire structure. U.S. Patent No. 3,903,416 also describes a method 
and apparatus for inspecting tires which employ an X-ray 
source emitting X-rays from the interior of the 
tire through the tire structure onto a panoramic 
radiation detection unit. The claimed advantage of 
the apparatus was the avoidance of excessive  
 
manipulation to X-ray the tire, the tire being rotated 
about its axis to facilitate complete inspection. Another interesting apparatus was invented by 
Horst Steffel and it is described in U.S. Patent No. 
3,809,900. The apparatus for the continuous overall 
X-ray examination of a motor vehicle tire which is 
rotatably supported in an expanded state and comprises 
an X-ray apparatus for irradiating the tire from its 
interior. The invention provided one lateral X-ray 
tube adjacent each side of the tire to irradiate the 
sidewall of the tire. Preferably, a third X-ray tube 
was provided to irradiate the tread from the interior 
of the tire. In 1989, a U.S. Patent issued to Leonard O. 
Curry, U.S. Patent No. 4,839,914. This portable X-ray 
apparatus included an X-ray tube and a fluoroscope 
which were spaced apart approximately the length of 
the outer diameter of the tire and were aligned to 
irradiate an area including at least half the width of 
the tread and a portion of the sidewall. The Curry 
apparatus was claimed to be particularly well adapted 
for inspecting defects in used tires to be used in 
retreading operations. The principal advantages of 
the positioning of the X-ray tube

The method of inspecting a tire casing with 
a breaker reinforcement, the method comprising the 

steps of: 

a) external of the casing, aligning a 
source and a detector, the source angularly 

transmitting a beam across the shoulder region of the 
tire and angularly impinging a portion of the detector 

with the beam; 
b) rotating the casing about its axis of 
rotation; 
c) receiving the beam image of the 
shoulder region of the casing; and 
d) observing any separation or lifting of 
the breaker edge of the casing relative to the rest of 

the breaker as displayed onto a screen. 
The method for inspecting a pneumatic tire 
casing of claim 1 comprising the steps of: 


a) positioning the line between a source 
and a detector at an angle ϑ greater than 45°, ϑ being 

the angle formed between the line and the mid-circumferential 
plane of the tire casing. 
The method of claim 2 further comprising the 
step of: 

   shielding the detector from that portion of 
the emitted beam that does not pass through the 

casing. 
An apparatus for inspecting a pneumatic tire 
casing, the apparatus characterized by: 

   a traversable carriage assembly, the 
assembly being pivotally and linearly movable; 

   a source of penetrating radiation attached 
to the traversable carriage assembly, the source being 

capable of emitting a beam; 
   an image detector linearly spaced along the 

beam path or axis of the source, the detector being 
attached to the traversable carriage assembly; 

   a means for energizing the source; 
   a means for aligning the source and detector 

external of the casing, the source angularly 
transmitting a beam across the shoulder region of the 

tire and angularly impinging a portion of the 
detector, the positioned beam intersecting a lateral 

edge of at least one breaker or belt in the casing. 
The apparatus of claim 4 wherein the source 
and the detector are positioned external of the casing 

when positioning the beam to intersect a lateral edge 
of a breaker at an angle ϑ of greater than 45° 

relative to the mid-circumferential plane of the 
casing.
