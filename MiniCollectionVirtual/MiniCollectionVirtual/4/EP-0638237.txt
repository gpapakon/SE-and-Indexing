<ABSTRACT>
An attractant and feeding stimulant for cockroach containing at least one compound represented by general formula (I) 
wherein R represents amino or aminomethyl. It has a significantly potent attractant and feeding stimulating action on male and 

female cockroaches of the types known as the domestic pest.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to attracting and 
ingestion-stimulating agents for cockroaches. Cockroach is one of the sanitarily harmful insects 
most widely known throughout the world. As the house 
cockroach are known Periplanetafuliginosa L., P.japonica 
K., P.americana L., Blattellagermanica L., 
Blattaorientalis L., etc. In general, it is important for extermination of 
cockroach to possess both an attracting activity and an 
ingestion-stimulating activity. We have already provided 
several cockroach attracting and ingestion-stimulating 
agents which simultaneously possess the activities both 
[USP 4,627,981; USP 4,911,907]. Tetralol, naphthol and phenol compounds and Iris 
tectoramines alcohols, which are active ingredients of these 
cockroach attracting and ingestion-stimulating agents, are 
sufficiently active without any additives. However, they 
are often active against male P.americana L. only and, when 
applied to colonies of other species of cockroach or  
 
colonies of female cockroach only, they sometimes produce 
lower effects. In order to cover the defects of the prior art 
attracting and ingestion-stimulating agents for cockroach 
and to provide more effective ones, we have investigated a 
variety of tetralin compounds, naphthalene compounds, 
benzene compounds and other heterocyclic compounds for their 
cockroach attracting and ingestion-stimulating activities. 
As a result of extensive studies on bicyclic nitrogen-containing 
compounds as set forth below in Test Example 1, 
we have found that specific tetralin compounds exhibit a 
high attracting and ingestion-stimulating action in adult 
P.americana L. and further that they have both an attracting 
and an ingestion-stimulating actions which are highly active 
against many species of cockroach, and that the activity 
does not go down even when male and female cockroaches live 
together. This invention is directed to attracting and 
ingestion-stimulating agents for cockroach comprising as an 
active ingredient one or more compounds represented by the 
formula 
wherein R represents an amino group or an aminomethyl group.  The compounds represented by the formula I are 
known compounds disclosed, for example, in the literatures 
cited below. However, none of these compounds are known for 
their cockroach attracting and ingestion-stimulating 
activities:
