<ABSTRACT>
Rotary tabletting press, of which the top ram (18) and bottom ram (19) are sealed with respect to the mould plate (15) by a partition wall (28) in which both rams (18 and 19) are clamped in, at their head end, by individual bushes (45) which are fastened, by one end, at the opening border (44) of a circular opening (43) of the partition wall, said circular openings (43) enclosing the ram shafts (20) at a distance, with the result that the partition wall (28) can be deformed in a constraint-free manner when the rams (18 and 19) move up and down.

<CLAIMS>
A rotary tabletting press having a rotating die table (12) and top and bottom punches 
(18, 19) which can move up and down, coaxially with the dies (17), in punch guides 

(22, 23), and all the top punches (18) and all the bottom punches (19) of which are 
each fixed with their punch shanks (20, 21) sealed to a flexible, annular diaphragm 

(28), which is disposed between the die plate (15) and the top punch guides (22) and 
the bottom punch guides (23), respectively, and which is fixed with at least its inner 

edge (34) sealed to the die table (12), characterised in that the flexible, annular 
diaphragm (28) comprises, in the region of each punch (18, 19), an opening (43) 

surrounding the punch shank (20, 21) thereof at a distance and a flexible bushing 
(45), one edge of which is imperviousl
y attached to the edge (44) of the opening in 
the diaphragm (28) and the other, free edge (46) of which is attached sealed to the 

punch shank (20, 21). 
A press according to claim 1, characterised in that the bushing (45) has a bead (47) 
at its edge (46) to be fixed to the punch shank (20), which bead engages in an 

encircling groove (48) disposed on the punch shank (20). 
A press according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the bushing (45) consists of 
one piece with the diaphragm (28) and extends axially from the latter towards the die 

(17). 
A press according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the bushing (45) 
is constructed as an expansion bellows. 
A press according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the outer edge of 
the diaphragm (28) extends into a flexible annular wall (30) which extends 

substantially axially, which is constructed as an expansion bellows, and which is fixed 
with its free edge (38) sealed to the die table (12).  

 
A press according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the inner edge 
(34) of the diaphragm (28) and the free edge (38) of the annular wall (30) are 

clamped to the die table (12) with tightening straps (37, 39). 
A press according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the annular wall 
(30) is formed from two flexible bellows (40, 41) which are joined to each other by 

a cylindrical wall part (42). 
A press according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that at least one 
bushing (45) is disposed in the region of a radial connecting seam (50) in the 

diaphragm (28).
