<ABSTRACT>
Pressure in a pad (17, 18) for application to the human body is controlled using a piston/diaphragm and cylinder device (19). The piston or diaphragm both acts to apply a force to increase/decrease pressure in the pad and experiences the pressure existing in the pad, thus eliminating the need for a pressure transducer in the pad. In preferred embodiments a deadload-balancing pressure is applied to the rear of the piston or diaphragm. A reservoir (41) whose pressure can be altered may be used to produce different values of deadload-balancing pressure. Preferably the piston/diaphragm is electromagnetically actuated, in particular using devices of the type described in WO93/01646. The pad or pads (17, 18) whose pressure is controlled may be provided in a variety of devices, such as a motion simulation seat, a bed or mattress, a massage cuff or sleeve, or a vehicle seat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the control
of pressure in one or more cushions or pads in a low-pressure
regime, that is, at pressures of the sort
generally applicable to the human body. More
particularly, the invention concerns the control of
pressure in such pads using a piston/diaphragm and
cylinder device.There is a wide variety of situations in which
it is desirable to control pressure in cushions or pads
applied to the human body. Motion simulation chairs are
known in which the sensation of movement is imparted to
a seated person by variation of pressure in cushions on
the seat and back of the chair. Similarly, special beds
or mattresses have been constructed for the avoidance of
bed sores and these may consist of a matrix of
inflatable air cells whose pressure is controlled.Furthermore, a number of new uses of
controllable-pressure pads suggest themselves. For
example, a massage cuff or sleeve could be formed from
one or more variable-pressure pads. Beds, couches or
mattresses having arrays of variable-pressure pads may
have pressure changes co-ordinated with some outside
stimulus, such as music or the breathing/pulse of a
subject, for the purposes of relaxation or aiding sleep.
Also, there are applications where it is desirable to
maintain a constant pressure in a pad despite changes in
its loading, for example in order to reduce the effects
of a bumpy ride on a seated passenger.The following description will be given in
terms of pressure control in a motion simulation seat.
However, it is to be understood that corresponding
features may be used for other applications, such as
those mentioned above, with appropriate adaptation of
detailed structure and control. As indicated above, motion simulation seats
using variable-pressure pads are already known. US
patent 4059909 describes such a seat and, in Fig. 8
thereof, indicates how pressure in the pads is
controlled. Control signals A'B' are used to activate
valves 77,78 connected to a source of pressurized air so
as to increase pressure in the associated pads. In
order to decrease pad pressure the valves are arranged
to exhaust to the outside.US patent 4321044 relates to a motion
simulation seat of the same general type, in which pad
pressure is monitored by a pressure transducer. Control
signals taking into account existing pad pressure are
used selectively to activate a flow valve connected to a
compressor and a vacuum pump (see Fig.7 thereof).Embodiments of the present invention provide
apparatus for accurately controlling pressure in pads
