<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
polymerization apparatus improved in heat dissipation 
ability. Conventionally, as polymerization apparatuses used in 
suspension polymerization or the like of a vinyl chloride 
based-monomer, for example, polymerization apparatuses are 
known that comprise a polymerization vessel equipped with a 
reflux condenser, a cooling jacket, an agitator, a nozzle 
through which raw materials are charged, a nozzle through 
which the polymer is withdrawn, and the like. In these 
polymerization apparatuses, the removal of heat 
(dissipation of heat) of polymerization is effected mainly 
through said reflux condenser and jacket. Further, as polymerization apparatuses that adopt 
other heat dissipation system, there are also known a 
polymerization apparatus comprising a polymerization vessel 
with a cooling coil, a draft tube, and the like attached 
thereto and a polymerization apparatus having a cooling 
apparatus outside thereof wherein the polymerization 
reaction product is passed through the outside cooling 
apparatus where the heat of the polymerization reaction 
product is removed and then the polymerization reaction 
product is returned to the polymerization vessel.  However, in suspension polymerization particularly of 
vinyl chloride or a monomer mixture mainly made up of vinyl 
chloride (hereinafter referred to as a vinyl chloride 
based-monomer), to place an internal structure, such as a 
cooling coil and a draft tube, in the polymerization vessel 
results in an increase in power required for agitation. 
That also causes the mixing performance of the charged 
materials to drop thereby allowing part of the flow in the 
polymerization vessel to slow down. As a result, the 
temperature in the polymerization vessel becomes 
nonuniform, so that the sizes of grains of the obtained 
polymer become nonuniform and further polymer scale is 
liable to be deposited on the inner wall of the 
polymerization vessel. The scale causes fish eyes to 
increase, which damages the quality of molded items 
considerably. Thus, to remove heat by such a means makes 
the structure in the polymerization vessel complicate and 
therefore leads to various problems. Further, the method wherein a cooling apparatus is 
placed outside a polymerization vessel and a polymer 
mixture is circulated through that cooling apparatus 
requires, in addition to the management and maintenance of 
the polymerization vessel, the management and maintenance 
in the circulation line and makes such an operation as
