<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to analogue-to-digital converters, and especially to 
sigma-delta analogue-to-digital converters. Sigma-delta analogue-to-digital converters include quantising means for 
producing a digital output, oversampled relative to the signal bandwidth, and a 
feedback path for feeding a signal derived from the digital output to be combined 
in analogue form with the analogue input for input to filter means, the output of the 
filter means being applied to the quantising means. This permits improved 
signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved from coarse quantisation by shaping the 
quantisation noise spectrum to suppress it within a desired bandwidth. The extent to which the quantising noise is shaped in the signal passband 
depends upon the order of the loop filter within the sigma-delta analogue-to-digital 
converter, the depth of the null in the quantising noise increasing as the order of the 
loop filter increases. Thus, referring to Figure 1, a third order bandpass 
sigma-delta analogue-to-digital converter is theoretically possible. An analogue input 
1 is combined at summing node 2 with an analogue version, due to 
digital-to-analogue converter 3, of the digital output 5, which is fed back along a 
negative feedback path 6, to produce a difference signal in the form of a current 
which flows in the first stage 7 of the filter means. Each stage 7, 8, 9 the filter 
means consists of a resonant circuit (inductor and capacitor in parallel) 
connected to a series resistor. The resulting voltage appears at the input of  
 
voltage-to-current converter buffer amplifier 10 producing a current at its output which 
flows in the second stage 8 of the filter, likewise producing a voltage input to a 
voltage-to-current converter buffer amplifier 11. Similarly, an output current flows 
in the third stage 9 of the filter means which causes a voltage to be applied to the 
voltage-to-current converter buffer amplifier 12, the output current of which develops 
across a resistor (not shown) a voltage at the input of quantising 
means 13. The voltage across the third stage 9 of the filter means in response to an input 
analogue current depends upon the voltage across the second stage 8 of the filter 
means which in tum depends upon the voltage across the first stage 7. The 
response of each stage can perhaps best be understood by considering the effect 
of a pulse input current at summing node 2, imagining the forward path to be 
broken just before quantising means 13. Referring to Figure 2, the output

<CLAIMS>
An analogue-to-digital converter comprising an input for analogue signals, 
quantising means (13) for producing a digital output, a feedback loop (6) for 

feeding a signal derived from the digital output to be combined in analogue form 
with the analogue input for input to filter means, the filtered signal being fed in use 

to the quantising means, the filter means comprising at least two stages, the 
filtered signal being derived in use using the output of at least one stage other 

than the first which is representative only of the response of the corresponding 
filter order and not of other filter orders, characterised in that there are at least 

three filter stages, the output of the third stage being representative only of the 
third order response, and in that there is provided a limiter (26) in the output of the 

third stage of the filter to promote overload recovery. 
An analogue to digital converter as claimed in claim 1, including a buffer 
amplifier between two filter stages which buffer amplifier incorporates low or high 

pass filtering to reduce the phase slope imparted by the buffer amplifier. 
An analogue-to-digital converter as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, in which 
there are four filter stages, the output of the fourth stage is representative only of 

the fourth order response, and there is provided a limiter (26a) in the output of the 
fourth stage of the filter.
