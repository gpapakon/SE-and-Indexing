<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to dental
equipment. More particularly the invention relates to an
apparatus for endoscopic viewing, without the
need for surgical incision and/or excision of the gum, of
subgingival tooth surfaces or subgingival tissues. The
invention is operative to permit visualization, guidance,
monitoring, and assessment of any type of treatment
procedure directed to the subgingival tooth surfaces or
periodontium including, but not limited to, subgingival
plaque and calculus removal procedures.Periodontal disease encompasses a group of different
disorders which affect the gums or supporting structures of
the teeth. The general epidemiology of plaque associated
periodontal disease typically begins with the formation of
supragingival microbial plaque which, if left untreated,
subsequently invades the normally closed space between the
free gingiva and the tooth surface. If left unremoved,
such subgingival plaque gives rise to the formation of
hardened calculi and areas of erosion on the subgingival
surfaces of the tooth (i.e. the subgingival enamel and root
surfaces). Resultant inflammation of the surrounding
tissues and recession of the surrounding connective tissue
and bone then occurs. Such inflammation and recession of
the periodontia results in the formation of a gap or
"periodontal pocket" between the gingival tissue and the
adjacent tooth surface. The gradual loss of ligamentous
attachment and surrounding alveolar bone mass in 
periodontal disease often results in loss of the affected
tooth, unless effective treatment is administered to halt
the progression of the disease.Clinically, plaque associated periodontal disease may
be treated by either a surgical or nonsurgical approach.The surgical approach to the treatment of plaque
associated periodontal disease typically involves the
performance of one or more surgical procedures whereby the
gingival tissue is excised and the underlying tooth
surfaces (e.g. subgingival enamel and a portion of the
root) are visually examined and subjected to scaling and
root planing under direct visualization. Although the
surgical approach to the treatment of plaque associated
periodontal disease is often highly effective, such
surgical approach is also associated with significant
expense and a significant degree of patient discomfort.The nonsurgical approach to the treatment of plaque
associated periodontal disease typically involves
procedures known as subgingival scaling and root planing.

<CLAIMS>
A device for endoscopic examination of the subgingival anatomy without
surgical incision of the gingiva, said device comprising:


a) an elongate hand piece (12) sized and configured to be grasped by the
human hand, said hand piece having a proximal and distal end;
b) a probe (14, 16) extending from the distal end of said hand piece, said
probe being sized and configured to be insertable between the intact non-incised free

gingiva and an adjacent tooth surface;
c) a light transmitting pathway (18) extending longitudinally through at least
a portion of said probe and terminating distally in at least one light outlet port (24a, 24b)

on said probe to cast illuminating light between said gingiva and said adjacent
subgingival tooth surface;
d) said light transmitting pathway (18) being connectable to an illumination
apparatus (26) to pass illuminating light through said light transmitting pathway into the

space between the intact non-incised gingiva and adjacent subgingival tooth surface.
e) an optical image transmitting pathway (20) extending longitudinally
through at least a portion of said probe and terminating distally in at least one optical

image receiving port (24c) on said probe for receiving an optical image from a location
between the intact non-incised gingiva and an adjacent subgingival tooth surface;
f) said optical image transmitting pathway being connectable to an optical
image displaying apparatus (30,32,36) to provide a visual display of an optical image

received through said optical image pathway;

and characterised in that the probe has a working part to serve as: a scaling tool or
rotating tool for scraping deposited material from said subgingival tooth surface; a sonic

transmission means for delivering sonic energy to sonically remove deposited material
from said subgingival tooth surface; an ultrasound transmission means for delivering 

ultrasonic energy to ultrasonically remove deposited material from said subgingival tooth surface;
a laser transmission means for delivering laser energy to effect laser treatment of the

subgingival anatomy; or a dilator having at least one dilator projection (60) sized and
configured to spread the intact non-incised gingiva away from the adjacent subgingival

tooth surface when said probe is inserted therebetween.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that said light transmitting
pathway (18) and said optical image transmitting pathway (20) are formed of optical

fibres.
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, further characterised by at least one
fluid passage lumen (40) extending through at least a portion of said probe connectable

to a fluid and/ or suction source for infusing and/or aspirating via a lumen port (46) in the
probe fluid into and/or out of the space between the intact non-incised gingiva and an

adjacent subgingival tooth surface.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that said probe is constructed of flexible materials so as to able bendable to a desired

curvature prior to insertion between the gingiva and adjacent subgingival tooth surface.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that said probe has a leading edge (28) and said light outlet port and image receiving

port are located adjacent said leading edge to permit endoscopic viewing of the
subgingival tooth surfaces immediately ahead of said leading edge.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that said image displaying device comprises an eyepiece (32), or a video or television

monitor (30).
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that a video recording device (34) can be operatively connected to the image displaying

device for recording received images.
