<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a transformer core of NiZn ferrite material. Said 
transformer core exhibits low overall losses when it is used in a transformer. Said low 

losses are attained if the majority of the grains of the sintered ferrite material have a 
monodomain structure. This is the case if the average grain size is smaller than 2.8 

microns. The average grain size of the sintered material preferably ranges of from 1.3 
to 2.6 microns. The δ-value is preferably less than
 4 nm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sintered transformer or inductor core of NiZn 
ferrite material. The invention also relates to an inductor and a transformer which are 
provided with such an inductor respectively transformer core. By means of a 
transformer the voltage and/or the current intensity of a current source can be converted 
to another desired voltage and/or current intensity. A transformer core of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph is 
known per se. For example, in Philips Data Handbook MA-01, 1993, pp. 131 and 132, 
a NiZn core is disclosed which is referred to as 4F1. The material composition of the 
core described in said handbook corresponds to the formula 
Ni0.49Zn0.49Co0.02Fe1.90O3.85. This transformer core is intended for use, in particular, 
in a so-called "power-transformer". This type of transformer can suitably be operated at 
frequencies in the MHz range and at relatively high induction values of 5 mT or higher. The drawback of the known transformer or inductor core is that it exhibits 
relatively high overall losses per volume unit (P) if it is used in a "power-transformer". 
Said losses cause the transformer to heat up. In particular, if the transformer is used at 
frequencies of from 2 MHz it heats up to relatively high temperatures. For example, as 
shown in fig. 7 on page 132, at 20°C an overall loss per volume unit of 190 mW/cm3 
is measured on these cores at an induction of 10 mT and a frequency of 3 MHz. It is an object of the invention to provide a transformer or inductor core 
which exhibits relatively low overall losses, in particular, when it is used in a power 
transformer. The invention further aims at providing an inductor as well as a power 
transformer which are provided with such an inductor respectively transformer core. These and other objects are achieved in accordance with the invention by 
a transformer or inductor core of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph, which is 
characterized in that the majority of the grains of ferrite material have a monodomain 
structure. It has been found that sintered cores of NiZn ferrite material having 
predominantly monodomain grains exhibit surprisingly low overall losses. As will be  
 
described in greater detail in the exemplary embodiments, the measure in accordance 
with the invention enables overall losses to be reduced by 50% or more. An exact 
explanation for this substantial decrease of the losses is not available as yet. The 
Applicant of the present invention, however, has experimentally established
