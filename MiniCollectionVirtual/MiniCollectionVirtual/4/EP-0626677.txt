<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium has a magnetic layer formed by 
a thin magnetic metal layer and a carbon protective layer on a 

non-magnetic substrate. The surface of the carbon protective 
layer has first protrusions formed by first particles and second 

protrusions formed by second particles. The carbon protective 
film has a thickness in the range of 3 nm to 30 nm, while the 

first protrusions have the heights of 65 nm ± 15 nm to 95 nm ± 
15 nm and the second protrusions have the heights of 18 nm ± 5 

nm to 28 nm ± 5 nm. Since the surface properties of the carbon 
protective film are controlled in this manner, the electro-magnetic 

conversion characteristics may be prevented from being 
lowered due to the spacing losses for improving the running 

durability of the recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a so-called thin magnetic metal
film type magnetic recording medium comprising a thin magnetic
metal layer as a magnetic layer on a non-magnetic substrate.In the field of a video tape recorder, for example, a
stronger demand is raised for high density recording with a view
to achieving high picture quality. As a magnetic recording
medium for accommodating for such demand, a so-called thin
magnetic film type magnetic recording medium has been proposed,
in which a magnetic layer is formed on the non-magnetic substrate
by directly depositing a magnetic material of metal or a Co-Ni
alloy on the substrate by plating or vacuum thin film forming
techniques, such as vacuum deposition, sputtering or ion plating.The magnetic recording medium of the thin magnetic film type
has many advantages, including superior coercivity, rectangular
ratio and electro-magnetic conversion characteristics in the
short wavelength range, only little demagnetization during
recording, only little thickness loss during reproduction because
of the reduced thickness of the recording layer and high packing
density of the magnetic material because of it being unnecessary
to mix the non-magnetic binder material into the magnetic layer.In such magnetic recording medium, attempts have been made
to increase the track density and the recording density of the
magnetic recording medium in order to accommodate for the 
increased recording density. However, if the recording density
becomes higher, spacing losses are increased. Consequently, a
smooth surface of the magnetic recording medium tends to be
preferred in order to prevent the adverse effects of the
increased spacing losses.However, if the surface of the magnetic recording medium is
smoothed excessively, the magnetic head tend to be adsorbed onto
the recording medium, so that the force of friction therebetween
is increased, with the result that the records medium is injured
by a larger shearing force generated therein.In order to assure satisfactory still characteristics, it
has been practiced to provide surface protrusions on the non-magnetic
substrate and thereby to afford moderate roughness to
the surface of the magnetic layer or the protective layer stacked
on the non-magnetic recording medium so as to control surface
properties of the magnetic recording medium.For controlling the surface properties of the magnetic
recording medium as described above, the size control of the
surface protrusions formed on the non-magnetic recording medium
becomes crucial. That
