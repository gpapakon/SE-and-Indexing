<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adaptation of a method for detecting the catalytic efficiency of catalytic converters with different efficiencies, in which a lambda probe is arranged upstream (2) and downstream (4) respectively of the catalytic converter (3) to be tested, in that probes (2, 4) with a differing response time are used for the two lambda probes.

Device for the adaptation of methods for checking 
catalyst efficiency to catalysts of different efficiency, 

in which an oxygen probe (2, 4) is arranged upstream and 
downstream of the catalyst (3) in each case and the 

oxygen probes (2, 4) have different response times, 
characterized in that the response time of the oxygen 

probe is varied by a variation of the protective tube of 
the oxygen probe. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the oxygen probe (4) downstream of the catalyst (3) 

has a longer response time than the oxygen probe (2) 
upstream of the catalyst (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the oxygen probe (4) downstream of the catalyst (3) 

has a shorter response time than the oxygen probe (2) 
upstream of the catalyst (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the response time of the oxygen probe is varied by 

a variation of the material of the probe. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the response time of the oxygen probe is varied by 

the provision of a catalytically active protective sheath 
around the sensor element. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the probe consists of a thick-film sensor, and the 

response time of the oxygen probe is varied by a variation 
of the element thickness.
