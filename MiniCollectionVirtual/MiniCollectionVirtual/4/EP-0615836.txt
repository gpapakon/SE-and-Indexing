<ABSTRACT>
A compactor for producing bales of waste material, 
such as cardboard, comprises a compaction chamber (18a) 

having a floor (25), inlet means for supplying to said 
chamber material to be compacted, outlet means through 

which compacted material can pass from said chamber, a 
compactor plate (19) moveable in the chamber to compress 

material therein, the floor being tippable to commence the 
removal from the chamber of a bale, and means (30: 36: 39) 

for effecting said tipping, disposed beneath the floor and 
mechanically unconnected to the compactor plate. Also 

disclosed is a latch for facilitating opening of a door 
(43) of a compactor after a bale has been formed in the 

compaction chamber thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a compactor, particularly 
of the kind used to compress waste material, such as 
cardboard, to form bales, which are then bound for 
subsequence transport. Figure 1 shows a prior art arrangement comprising 
three compaction units 10 side-by-side in a row. Each 
unit has an open top and an interior compaction chamber 
11. Arranged across the respective adjacent top sides of 
the units 10 are a pair of rails 12 (only one shown), on 
which is reciprocably arranged a rolling carriage 13. The 
carriage carries a tank 14 for hydraulic fluid, a motor 15 
for supplying and exhausting pressurised hydraulic fluid 
and, below the tank and motor, a vibratory compactor plate 
16 arranged to move down into the compactor chamber 11 of 
the unit 10 over which the carriage 13 is positioned at 
any one time. The downward movement of the plate 16 
compresses waste material, such as cardboard 17, in the 
chamber. After the required compressive force has been 
applied, the plate is raised, by the force of hydraulic 
fluid, clear of the unit, and the carriage moves along its 
rails to be over the open top of the next unit, where the 
compression operation is repeated. The units at which the 
carriage is not positioned can, during this time, be 
charged through their respective open tops with waste 
material to be compressed. Once a chamber 11 has the required amount of waste 
material therein, the upward movement of the plate 16 
after final compression, is arranged to engage a 
mechanical mechanism within the chamber, which results in 
pivotal movement of a base of the unit 10 which forms a 
floor of the chamber. This tipping is usually carried out 
after a door of the unit is opened. The tipped bale can 
then be bound with steel strip or the like prior to final 
removal from the unit. Removal of the compressed bale 
would normally be very difficult without this tipping 
step. The mechanical mechanism can take several forms, 
but generally its presence within the chamber provides 
drawbacks. Firstly it will be appreciated that space must 
normally be left between at least parts of the periphery 
of the compactor plate 16 and the internal walls of the 
chamber to allow the plate to clear the mechanism during  
 
normal up and down movement of the plate to compress fresh charges of 
waste material delivered to the chamber. This reduces the effective 
compressive area. Secondly this space allows waste material to reach 
the area above the plate 16 and possibly interfere with the components 
of the

<CLAIMS>
A compactor comprising a compaction chamber (18a) having a 
floor (25), inlet means for supplying to said chamber material to be 

compacted, in use, outlet means through which compacted material can 
pass from said chamber, in use, a compaction member (19) moveable in 

said chamber to compress material supplied thereto, at least part of said 
floor being tippable, in use, so as to effect at least part of the passage of 

compacted material from the chamber, and means for effecting said 
tipping, said means 

for effecting said tipping (30: 36: 39) and said compaction member (19) being 
mechanically unconnected, characterized in that said means 

for effecting said tipping 
(30: 36: 39) 

are disposed directly underneath said floor (25). 
A compactor according to Claim 1, wherein said means for 
effecting said tipping include a member which is moveable between 

extended and retracted states, in use, by means of hydraulic fluid, and 
which in one of said states effects said tipping of said floor (25). 
A compactor acording to Claim 2, wherein said member is a 
piston rod (27). 
A compactor according to Claim 3, wherein the piston rod (27) 
is connected to a pivotally mounted bell-crank lever (30) having means 

for engaging said floor. 
A compactor according to Claim 3, wherein the piston rod (27) 
is connected to a pivotally mounted lazy-tongs linkage (36) having means 

for engaging said floor. 
A compactor according to Claim 2, wherein said member is a 
telescopic lifting jack (39) having means for engaging said floor.  

 
A compactor according to any one of Claims 2 to 6, wherein 
the compaction member (19) is moveable relative to a single hydraulic 

unit (22) which, in use, supplies hydraulic fluid to operate the 
compaction member and also supplies said hydraulic fluid to operate 

said means for effecting said tipping disposed underneath said floor. 
A compactor according to Claim 7, wherein said single 
hydraulic unit (22) is fixed to part of a body defining said compaction 

chamber. 
A compactor according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein said tipping of said floor is independent of the operation of said 

compaction member.
