Oil-sealed vacuum pump with 

a pump casing (2), 
a suction chamber (3) located within the pump 
casing, 
a rotor (4) arranged rotatably within the suction 
chamber, 
an inlet pipe (7) capable of being connected to a 
receiving vessel, 
an outlet pipe (8) provided with a check valve (9), 
an oil-supply line (11) passing into the suction 
chamber (3) and provided with a valve (13), and also 
an electrical drive motor (14) for the rotor (4), 
characterised in that
 the drive motor (14) is provided 
with a speed-dependent sensor (20), in that the valve 

(13) is a valve which is capable of being actuated 
electrically and in that a switch (29) is provided in the 

electrical circuit (24, 25) of the valve (13) which, 
depending on the signals supplied by the sensor (20), is 

controlled in such a way that the valve (13) is open in 
the case of normal operating speed and closed in the case 

of reduced speed. 
Oil-sealed vacuum pump according to Claim 1, in which the 
drive pump (14) has a first motor coil (main winding 15), 

a second motor coil (auxiliary winding 20) and also a 
capacitor (16), 
characterised in that
 the auxiliary 
winding (20) forms the sensor by use being made of the 

voltage that drops via the coil (20) of the drive motor 
(14). 
Vacuum pump according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that
 a logic circuit (26) is provided with a view to 
evaluation of the signals of the sensor (20).  

 
Vacuum pump according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 
the logic circuit (26) is connected to a switch (28, 29) 

via a signal line (27). 
Vacuum pump according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 
the switch is a relay (28, 29). 
Vacuum pump according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 
the switch is a semiconductor switch. 
Vacuum pump according to Claim 4, 5 or 6, 
characterised 
in that
 an optical coupling section is connected to the 
logic circuit (26) by way of signal line. 
Vacuum pump according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that
 with a view to evaluation of the signals of the 
sensor (20) a component is provided which has a logic 

function and a semiconductor-switch function.
