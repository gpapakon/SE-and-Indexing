<ABSTRACT>
A pressure connection type connector a pressure connection 
type connector including a pressure connection type contact 

comprising first and second pressure connection type terminals 
arranged in parallel relation in an axial direction of a cable 

conductor in a coated cable, and a third pressure connection 
type terminal located on an intermediate line between the first 

and second pressure connection type terminals but displaced 
radially of the cable conductors, the coated cable being 

pressed against the pressure connection type contact by a 
pressing member so that the coating of the coated cable is 

pierced through and broken by tips of the first to third 
pressure connection type terminals projecting from the coated 

cable and the conductors of the coated cable are pressed in 
between the first and third pressure connection type terminals 

and between the second and third pressure connection type 
terminals, respectively, so that the tips of the first to third 

pressure connection type terminals are inserted into a 
receiving hole of the pressing member, wherein the pressure 

connection type connector comprises first and second 
inclination surface elements formed on wall of the receiving 

hole of the pressing member, the first inclination surface 
element being adapted to press the tips of the first to third 

pressure connection type terminals radially of the cable 
conductor on the projecting side thereby to render contracting  

 
and closing force to the first to third pressure connection 

type terminals, and the second inclination surface element 
being adapted to press the tips of the first and second pressure 

connection type terminals axially of the cable conductor on the 
projecting side thereby to render contracting and closing force 

to the first and second pressure connection type terminals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pressure connection type 
connector (i.e, connector for press-in connection with 
conductors), which is capable of achieving an electrical 
connection under pressure by piercing through and breaking the 
coating of a coated cable and catching the core-wire or cable 
conductor in the coated cable. Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 57-53629 discloses a 
pressure connection type connector including a pressure 
connection type contact comprising first and second pressure 
connection type terminals upstanding in parallel relation in an 
axial direction of the conductors of a coated cable, and a third 
pressure connection type terminal located on an intermediate 
line between the first and second pressure connection type 
terminals but displaced radially of the cable conductors. In 
this pressure connection type connector, the coated cable is 
caused to press against the pressure connection type contact by 
a pressing member so that the coating of the coated cable is 
pierced through and broken by tips of the first to third 
pressure connection type terminals projecting from the coated 
cable and the conductors of the coated cable are pressed in  
 
between the first and third pressure connection type terminals 
and between the second and third pressure connection type 
terminals, respectively, so that the tips of the first to third 
pressure connection type terminals are inserted into a 
receiving hole of the pressing member. However, with the progress of the tendency and increasing 
requirements for making a small pitch arrangement of the 
pressure connection type contacts, thin cable conductor and 
miniaturization of the first to third pressure connection type 
terminals, it becomes increasingly difficult to achieve 
reliable electrical connections with the cable conductor 
between the first and third pressure connection type terminals 
and between the second and third pressure connection type 
terminals and obtain sufficient amount of connecting pressure 
relative to the cable conductor. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a pressure connection type connector in which a 
reliable electrical connection is assuredly obtained. In order to achieve the above object, there is essentially 
provided a pressure connection type connector a pressure 
connection type connector including a pressure connection type 
contact comprising first and second pressure connection type 
terminals arranged in parallel relation in an axial direction 
of a cable conductor in
