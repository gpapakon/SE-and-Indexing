<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the production of
ceramides and hybrid ceramides via the use of lipases to
perform the selective acylation of the amino group of
lysosphingolipids.Ceramides and derivatives thereof, are of great
commercial potential in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals such
as hair and skin care products (European
Patent Applications 420,722 and 500,437).Ceramides are a class of polar lipids (sphingolipids)
endogenous to the epidermis. Ceramides play a major role in
the water-retaining properties of the epidermis. It has been
found that topical applications of ceramide- and pseudoceramide- containing compositions are effective in restoring
the water content of dry skin and may be effective in
relieving atopic eczema (Kerscher, M. et al. (1991) Eur. J.
Dermatol., 1, 39-43; Imokawa, G. et al. (1989) J. Soc.
Cosmet. Chem., 40, 273-285).Lysosphingolipids are sphingolipid breakdown products
which lack the amide-linked fatty acyl group at the 2-position
of the sphingoid base (Hannun, Y.A. and Bell, R.M.
(1989) Science 243, 500-507).In current practice, ceramides are primarily obtained
via extraction and isolation from animal epidermal tissues,
usually from bovine or porcine epidermal tissue. Obviously,
this is a rather costly process on an industrial scale.
Moreover, it has been found that these materials are
potentially unsafe due to the possible presence of the agent causing bovine
spongiform encephalitis (BSE) in bovine tissue.Various chemical methods have been published
describing the synthesis of ceramides. However, these
methods often have the disadvantage of lacking the proper 
stereochemistry of the thus-produced end-products. Since
sphingolipids often have multiple chiral centers, it would
be advantageous to employ synthesis methods which reliably
provide only a desired stereoisomer, in order to obtain a
product which more closely resembles the compound as it
appears in nature. Moreover, these chemical synthetic
methods may also leave amounts of undesired residual
chemical reactants in the final products.The use of enzymes in chemical synthesis to produce
amides in organic solvent has been described (Zaks, A. and
Klibanov, A.M. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 82,
3192-3196). The enzymes most employed for this purpose are
lipases (triacylglyceride ester hydrolases; EC 3.1.1.3) and
esterases.Margolin, A.L. and Klibanov, A.M. ((1987) J. Am. Chem.
Soc., 109, 3802-3804) studied lipase-catalyzed peptide
synthesis in anhydrous organic solvents. Porcine pancreatic
