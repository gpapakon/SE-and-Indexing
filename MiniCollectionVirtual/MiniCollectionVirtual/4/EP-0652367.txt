<ABSTRACT>
In order to reduce the noise nuisance caused during 
operation by rotor blades of a rotor of a wind turbine the 

rear edge of each blade is irregularly formed. In particular 
the saw-tooth form with a top angle smaller than about 150° 

and preferably 10° is found to produce a considerable noise 
reduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a wind turbine with a rotor 
having a number of blades which each have a front edge and a 
rear edge. A drawback to the use of wind turbines is the noise 
nuisance caused during operation by the rotor, and more 
particularly by the rotor blades. It is the object of the invention to reduce this noise 
production. This is achieved according to the invention in 
that the rear edge of each blade is irregularly formed. More 
particularly, the rear edge of each blade has a saw-tooth 
form at least over a part. The saw teeth can take both a 
symmetrical and an asymmetrical form. The enclosed angle of 
the saw tooth is preferably smaller than about 150°, 
preferably 10°. Practical tests have demonstrated that a considerable 
noise reduction is obtained with blades formed in this 
manner. The invention is further elucidated with reference to 
the annexed drawings. 
Figure 1 shows a view of a wind turbine according to 
the invention, Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a portion of a 
blade with a saw-tooth edge according to the invention, Figure 3 shows an alternative embodiment, Figure 4 shows an embodiment with cut-in saw teeth, Figure 5 shows an alternative embodiment to that of 
figure 4, and Figure 6 shows yet another embodiment. As is usual, a wind turbine, for instance for generating 
electrical energy, comprises a mast 1, a rotor 2 and a 
number of, in the present embodiment three, blades 3, 4 and 
5. According to the invention the rear edge of each blade, 
as seen in rotation direction, is formed irregularly, for 
instance rear edge 6 of blade 3. The irregular form can have  
 
a different pattern. Examples are for instance a sinus-shaped 
pattern and a saw-tooth pattern. According to 
practical tests a saw-tooth pattern, whether symmetrical or 
not, with an enclosed angle α of each tooth of less than 
about 150° and preferably 10° produces the greatest noise 
reduction. When use is made of blades of curved cross section it 
is desirable for achieving the greatest noise reduction that 
the imaginary plane of the teeth according to the embodiment 
of figure 2 lies in the line of the curved plane acting as 
suction side. To implement this a saw tooth-shaped strip 7 
can be used which is fixed in suitable manner to the rear 
edge of the blade. Also possible is an embodiment (figure 3) wherein a 
blunt rear edge is slightly chamfered 8, wherein a saw 
tooth-shaped strip 9 is fixed onto the chamfered part such 
that the strip connects smoothly onto both the upper part 
and the lower
