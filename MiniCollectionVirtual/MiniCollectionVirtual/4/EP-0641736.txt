<ABSTRACT>
A slidable member (38) is slidably 
provided in the housing of a 

dispenser head (1) mounted on a cask 
(62) for a soft drink, a cleaning solution 

port (4) for delivering cleaning 
solution and a gas port (6) for 

delivering compressed gas are selectively 
opened or closed by operating 

this slidable member (38) with a handle. 
Furthermore, a pour-out valve of 

the dispenser (75) is formed of a three-way 
valve (77), whereby this three-way 

valve (77) is changed over to discharge 
the cleaning solution to a discharge 

pipe (67). Further, a cleaning 
solution return pipe (67) is connected 

to the three-way pour-out valve (77) to 
thereby form a cleaning solution circulating 

circuit, and, a four-way valve 
(93) is installed on this cleaning solution 

return pipe (67), whereby the 
four-way valve (93) is changed over to 

cause the cleaning solution to flow in 
the forward direction or reverse direction 

in the cleaning solution circulating 
circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a washing apparatus according
to the preamble of claim 1.A conventional draught beer pouring apparatus is shown in
FIG. 12. In FIG. 12, a reference numeral 110 shows a carbonic
acid gas cylinder which is a gas container for pushing beer, a
reference numeral 111 shows a beer keg in which draught beer is
accommodated, and a reference numeral 112 shows a dispensing
head.Carbonic acid accommodated in the carbonic acid cylinder
110 passes through a pressure reducing valve 113 by which
carbonic acid gas pressure is reduced to the most suitable
pressure, and reaches a space 111a formed in the upper portion
of the beer keg 111 via the conventional dispensing head 112.Beer in the lower portion 111b of the beer keg 111 passes
through the inner space of a pouring tube 112a of the
dispensing head 112 and a connecting hose 114 to reach a
dispenser 115. The dispenser 115 comprises a container 115a
for ice, a cooling coil 115b for cooling beer passing through
the interior thereof, and a pouring valve 115c for pouring beer 
into a beer cup (not shown). Beer passing through the
dispenser 115 is cooled and poured into the beer cup.If the dispensing head 112, the connecting hose 114 and
the cooling coil 115b of the beer pouring apparatus are not
periodically washed, microbe will increase to make the taste
of beer pouring into the beer cup become worse and dirty.Therefore, conventionally, whenever pouring of draught
beer is finished, the washing is done as follows. Namely, the
dispensing head 112 is taken away from the beer keg 111 to be
installed to a washing tank 116 filled with water or medicine
liquid as shown in FIG. 13. Water or liquid medicine is passed
through the dispensing head 112, the connecting hose 114 and
the cooling coil 115b by supplying carbonic acid to the washing
tank 116 in the same manner as the time of pouring beer, and
washing liquid used for washing the dispensing head 112, etc.,
is discharged to a container 117.Thus, at the time of washing, it takes much time to take
away the dispense head 112 from the beer keg and install to the
washing tank, and such an operation is troublesome.Further, in the method of washing as stated above, since
the pouring valve 115c of the dispenser 115 is a two position
valve thereby to scatter the washing liquid discharged from the
pouring valve 115c, it is impossible to flow washing liquid at
a high speed.A cooling coil washing apparatus
according to the preamble of claim 1 and
having a washing liquid
circuit is disclosed in Japanese Utility
