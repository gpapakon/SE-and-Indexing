<ABSTRACT>
Ultrasonic wave is emitted into an examined body. A first 
electric echo signal is generated in response to an echo of the 

ultrasonic wave. A controllable filter responsive to a control signal 
serves to extract components of the first electric echo signal which 

are in a desired frequency band, so that the first electric echo signal 
is converted into a second electric echo signal. A logarithmic 

detection device serves to subject the second electric echo signal to 
logarithmic compression and detection. A signal generator is 

operative for outputting plural calibration signals having different 
frequencies and different amplitudes. An input selection device is 

operative for connecting the signal generator with an input terminal 
of the filter during a calibration mode of operation. A control device 

is operative for calculating a corrective value from an output signal of 
the logarithmic detection device during the calibration mode of 

operation, and correcting a logarithmic conversion characteristic 
and an offset of the logarithmic detection device and the control 

signal to the filter in response to the calculated corrective value 
during reception of echoes of the ultrasonic wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus for
producing an image, for example, a sectional image, of an examined
body by emitting a beam of ultrasonic wave thereinto and receiving
related echoes therefrom.Typical ultrasonic diagnostic apparatuses emit a beam of
ultrasonic wave into an examined body, and receive related
ultrasonic echoes therefrom. The received ultrasonic echoes are
converted into corresponding electric echo signals. A sectional
image of the examined body is generated in response to the electric
echo signals.To increase the S/N (signal-to-noise) ratio of the image of the
examined body, a filter tuned to the frequency bands of the electric
echo signals is provided which removes noise components from the
electric echo signals. Generally, the frequency band of an electric
echo signal moves toward a lower side as the electric echo signal
relates to a deeper portion of an examined body. Thus, the filter is
generally of the tunable type, being responsive to a tuning control
signal. The pass band of the filter is adjusted in response to the
tuning control signal so as to match the frequency band of a
currently-processed electric echo signal.The control-signal response characteristic and the frequency 
response characteristic tend to vary from filter to
filter. Accordingly, in each ultrasonic diagnostic
apparatus, complicated adjustment containing manual
processes is usually required to compensate for such a
characteristic variation regarding a filter.EP-A-0072498, upon which the precharacterising
portion of appended claim 1 is based, describes an
ultrasound diagnosis apparatus in which ultrasound is
transmitted from a transducer of varying thickness.
Received ultrasound echoes are converted to electrical
signals and filtered with a characteristic which is
changed according to a change of the thickness of the
transducer.It is an object of this invention to provide an
improved ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus.According to the present invention, there is
provided an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus comprising:
means for emitting ultrasonic waves into a body to
be examined;means for generating a first electric echo signal in
response to an echo of the ultrasonic wave;a controllable filter responsive to a control signal
for extracting, in a normal mode of operation, components
of the first electric echo signal which are in a desired
frequency band, thereby converting the first electric echo 
signal into a second electric echo signal; characterised
bya logarithmic detection device
