<ABSTRACT>
A method of uniformly doping arsenic in situ includes forming a 
semiconductor substrate layer (10) and depositing an optional oxide layer 

(12) on the semiconductor substrate layer (10). A first doped polysilicon 
layer (14) is deposited on the oxide layer (12). An undoped polysilicon layer 

(16) is deposited on the first doped polysilicon layer (14). A second doped 
polysilicon layer (18) is deposited on the undoped polysilicon layer (16). The 

polysilicon layers (14), (16), and (18) are annealed such that a dopant within 
the first polysilicon layer (14) and the second polysilicon layer (18) diffuses 

throughout all the polysilicon layers in order to form a uniformly doped 
undivided polysilicon layer (24) on the oxide layer (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to semiconductor device 
fabrication processes and more particularly to a method for uniformly doping 
a polysilicon layer in situ. Conventional semiconductor device fabrication processes implant a 
dopant material, such as arsenic, in order to adjust and control the 
characteristics of the specific semiconductor device to be formed. Arsenic 
doping of polysilicon material is typically achieved by depositing undoped 
polysilicon and subsequently implanting arsenic into the undoped 
polysilicon. For applications requiring a high dopant concentration in a thick 
layer, high energy implantation is required. This implantation process is a 
costly method, both in terms of cycle time and capital equipment investment 
and usage. The implantation process is further undesirable in that higher 
concentrations of the implanted dopant occur near the surface of the layer, 
resulting in either high temperature anneals or extended anneal time at low 
temperatures to redistribute and activate the dopant. The dopant concentration profile for the implantation process shows a 
higher concentration towards the top of the polysilicon layer and a lower 
dopant concentration at the bottom of the polysilicon layer. The uniform 
dopant concentration throughout the layer is difficult to achieve by the 
implantation method. The dopant is implanted at the surface of a layer and 
thus must be redistributed throughout the layer by other processes which do 
not provide total uniformity. Further, deposition of a doped polysilicon layer in conventional 
semiconductor device fabrication processes takes a greater amount of time to 
complete than undoped polysilicon deposition. The deposition rate of  
 
undoped polysilicon is twenty to thirty times the deposition rate of doped 
polysilicon. The difference in time is due to the dopant having a higher 
affinity than silane to occupy the surface sites, inhibiting the decomposition 
of silane during deposition. Subsequent film deposition is controlled by the 
slower decomposition of silane. Thus, growing an in situ doped polysilicon 
layer in one step has a prohibitive long deposition period. Therefore, it is 
desirable to have a semiconductor fabrication process that achieves uniformly 
doped polysilicon layers without the cost and expense of conventional 
implantation processes or the length of time required for a full dopant 
deposition. From the foregoing, it may be appreciated that a need has arisen for a 
semiconductor device fabrication process
