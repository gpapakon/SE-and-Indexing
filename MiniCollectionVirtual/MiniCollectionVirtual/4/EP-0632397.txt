<DESCRIPTION>
The present Invention relates to a system for 
presenting data in an image of a book, and more 
particularly, to a book data service system in which the 
book data can be delivered by the broadcasting, only the 
necessary book data can be selectively stored, the service 
can be charged according to the accesses to the book data 
actually made, and the feedback from the user to a data 
center can be supported. In conjunction with the wide spread of the computers, 
various schemes for making it easier for a user to utilize 
the computer have been developed, including the so called 
Book-Metaphor which is an example of a system generally 
called electronic book in which the data are presented in 
an image of a book. The Book-Metaphor is a scheme for 
displaying the data on a computer in an image imitating a 
visual appearance of a usual book, in which various 
operation functions associated with the usual book such as 
a jumping from the table of contents to a desired page, 
turning pages one by one, etc. are also supported. The 
software for this Book-Metaphor comprises book data 
produced in accordance with the prescribed format, and a 
program for the display of the book data along with the 
operation functions of a book. An exemplary book data display image in the Book-Metaphor 
is shown in Fig. 1, which incorporates a number of 
navigation buttons for selectively activating the operation  
 
functions of a book supported in the Book-Metaphor arranged 
below the image of the book. Here, as summarized in Fig. 2, 
the navigation buttons include (a) a button for commanding 
a display of the front cover, (b) a button for commanding a 
display of the back cover, (c) a button for commanding a 
display of a next page (one page forward shift), (d) a 
button for commanding the display of a previous page (one 
page backward shift), (e) a button for commanding a 
continuously forward shift, (f) a button for commanding a 
continuously backward shift, (g) a button for commanding an 
attaching/removing of a slip, (h) a button for commanding a 
restoring of an original state before the previous 
operation (undo), and (i) a button for commanding an end of 
the use of the Book-Metaphor. it is noted that the types 
and shapes of the navigation buttons are not necessarily 
limited to those shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and described here, 
but the buttons for shifting one page forward and backward 
are indispensable. In addition, the Book-Metaphor also 
incorporates a basic function for displaying a page having 
a table of
