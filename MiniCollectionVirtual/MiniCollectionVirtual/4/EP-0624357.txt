<ABSTRACT>
For compulsory promotion of a physiologically correct process of walking, the present walking aid for rehabilitation of gait of patients with a walking impediment and/or at risk of falling comprises a support frame (1) which can be displaced on the ground by the patient and two holding members (4, 4') which are fastened on the frame so as to be pivotable at least approximately in the direction of displacement of the latter, in order to support the patient who is to become active. At least one of the supports on the support frame (1) comprises a supporting and drive wheel (2, 2'; 2''). On displacement of the walking aid by the patient, this wheel serves to enforce a mutually opposite pendulum movement of the holding members (4, 4') about their swivelling axis (9, 9') in a manner synchronous with the forward movement of the walking aid.
