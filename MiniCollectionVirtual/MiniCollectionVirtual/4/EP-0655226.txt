<ABSTRACT>
An orthodontic bracket (20) having mesial and distal 
sections (22, 24) is debonded from a tooth (40) by pivoting the 

sections toward each other in respective arcs about a 
central reference axis extending in an occlusalgingival 

direction. The mesial and distal sections 
are discrete and spaced apart from each other, or 

alternatively integrally joined by a relatively thin 
web that bends and optionally fractures upon 

debonding. A metallic archwire slot liner 
interconnects the mesial and distal sections and 

enhances sliding mechanics of the bracket. A pliers-like 
debonding tool includes jaws with stops for 

limiting the lingual depth of engagement of the jaws 
with the mesial and distal sides of the bracket, to 

facilitate pivoting of the mesial and distal sections 
during debonding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus
for removing a ceramic orthodontic bracket from a
tooth.Orthodontic treatment involves movement of the
teeth toward positions for correct occlusion. During
treatment, tiny orthodontic appliances known as
brackets are connected to the teeth, and an archwire
is placed in a slot of each bracket. The archwire
forms a track to guide movement of the teeth to
orthodontically correct positions.Orthodontic brackets are typically made of metal,
ceramic or plastic. Metal brackets are widely used
and are considered by many orthodontists to have
mechanical properties that are satisfactory for moving
the teeth to desired positions. Unfortunately, metal
brackets are not aesthetic in the mouth and often lead
to comments of a "metallic mouth appearance" that can
be an embarrassment to the patient.Orthodontic brackets that are made of a plastic
material are generally considered more aesthetic than
metal brackets. However, some plastic brackets are
stained by certain food and beverages and turn an
unsightly color after a period of time. Moreover, the
plastic material may slowly creep in use such that the 
archwire slot widens and precise control of tooth
movement is hindered.Orthodontic brackets that are made of transparent
or translucent ceramic materials overcome many of the
problems associated with plastic brackets, since
ceramic material is resistant to staining and does not
deform by creep as in the case with plastic brackets.
U.S. Patent No. 4,954,080, assigned to the assignee of
the present invention, describes a color-free ceramic
bracket made of polycrystalline material with a
translucency that permits the natural color of the
tooth to diffusely show through the bracket. An
improved translucent polycrystalline ceramic bracket
having a metallic archwire slot liner to enhance
sliding movement of the bracket on the archwire is
described in pending U.S. applications Serial Nos.
08/061,215 and 08/061,164, both of which were filed on
May 13, 1993.In the past, orthodontic brackets were commonly
secured to bands that were placed around the teeth.
Today, orthodontic brackets are often bonded directly
to the surface of the teeth. Once treatment has been
completed, the archwire is removed from the slot of
the brackets and each bracket is then removed from the
associated tooth.Metal brackets are typically debonded by using a
peeling or prying motion. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,986,265
and 4,248,587 describe plier-type hand instruments
that are used with a prying action to remove
orthod

A method of debonding a ceramic orthodontic bracket
(20) having a channel (32) that extends in a generally occlusal-gingival

direction between the mesial section (22) and the distal section (24),
this channel (32) having a depth in a lingual direction that is greater

than the lingual depth of the archwire slot (30) from a tooth (40)
comprising the steps of:


engaging a mesial side (42) and a distal side (44) of the
bracket (20) in areas located buccolabially of a base of the bracket (20);

and
urging the engaged mesial and distal sides (42, 44)
toward each other in order to pivot at least one of a mesial section (22)

and a distal section (24) of the bracket (20) away from underlying areas
of the tooth (40) about a reference axis generally parallel to a

longitudinal axis of the channel (32).
The method of claim 1, wherein said step of
urging the mesial side (42) and the distal side (44) toward each

other includes the step of fracturing a frangible web (38)
of the bracket (20) that extends in a direction generally

parallel to the longitudinal axis of the channel (32).
The method of claim 2, wherein said step of
fracturing a web (38) includes the step of breaking an

adhesive bond between structure interconnecting the
mesial section (22) and the distal section (24) in areas located

lingually of the channel (32).
The method of claim 2, wherein said step of
fracturing a web (38) includes the step of fracturing a

thin ceramic web that integrally interconnects the
mesial section (22) and the distal section (24) in areas of the

The method of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein said step of
