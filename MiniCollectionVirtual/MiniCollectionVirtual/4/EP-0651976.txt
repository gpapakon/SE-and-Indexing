<ABSTRACT>
Device for the attachment of a dental prosthesis in a human jaw, which comprises an implant (10) which is to be inserted in the jaw and is formed as a closed sleeve, a secondary member (24) which has a connecting shaft (28), can be connected to the implant and represents the carrier for the dental prosthesis (43), and a fastening element (40) for fixation of the dental prosthesis on the secondary member, the connecting shaft (28) sitting in the blind hole (14) of the implant (10) and having at least one axis-parallel slot (30) at the proximal end for the formation of a snap-on and spreading connection with an undercut (34) in the blind hole, the shaft having a radially spreadable section (32) which can be spread apart or radially fixed in the implant with the aid of a mandril (40) inserted via an axial bore in the secondary member, and the secondary member having a radial shoulder which is supported on the distal end of the implant when the spreadable section engages behind the undercut.
