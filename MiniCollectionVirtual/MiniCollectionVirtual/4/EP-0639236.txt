<DESCRIPTION>
 FLOOR COVERINGSField of the InventionThis invention relates to vinyl floor coverings with improved anti-slip characteristics, particularly to those in sheet or tile form and especially to those which have a clear wear layer.Background of the InventionVinyl sheet and vinyl tile floor coverings are well-known and have enjoyed considerable commercial success. They are based on homopolymers or copolymers of vinyl chloride, for example vinyl chloride/vinyl acetate copolymers. The homopolymers and the copolymers are both commonly referred to as PVC resins or PVC polymers. Compositions which comprise PVC resin are commonly referred to as PVC compositions or simply as PVC. PVC compositions which contain little or no plasticiser (for example up to about 2% by weight) are relatively rigid and brittle, and they are commonly referred to as rigid PVC, unplasticised PVC, or UPVC. PVC compositions which contain relatively large amounts of plasticiser (for example around 10-40% by weight) are more flexible and have a lower modulus, and they are commonly referred to as flexible PVC, plasticised PVC, or PPVC. Vinyl sheet and vinyl tile floor coverings are based on flexible PVC and are resilient floor coverings."PVC Technology", ed. W.V. Titow, Elsevier Applied Science Publishers, 4th Edition (1984), describes the manufacture, properties and uses of PVC. It uses the same terminology as that defined above. An article entitled "Vinyl Chloride Polymers" in Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, iley-Interscience, 3rd Edition, Supplement Volume (1989), pages 822-889, also describes the manufacture, properties and uses of PVC. An article entitled "Flooring Materials" in Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and 

Engineering, Wiley-Interscience, 3rd edition, Volume 7 (1987), pages 233-241 , describes the manufacture and uses of vinyl sheet and vinyl tile floor coverings.Vinyl sheet and vinyl tile floor coverings are usually composite materials constructed from a number of layers, in which each layer is specially formulated for a particular duty. Thus, the uppermost layer, which is commonly called the wear layer, is formulated for good resistance to abrasion and wear. In one common form of construction, the wear layer is transparent, so that the colouring or patterning of lower layers can be seen through it, and it may then be referred to as a clear wear layer. Flexible PVC compositions for use in a clear wear layer preferably have high clarity and transparency. It is also important that the wear layer should have good
