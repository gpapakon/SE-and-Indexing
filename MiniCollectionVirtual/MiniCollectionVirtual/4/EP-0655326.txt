<ABSTRACT>
The base material is a coextrusion formed from at least two 
layers, one being a support layer of polyolefin (such as 

polyethylene or polypropylene) and the other a contact layer based 
on modified polyolefin, the contact layer, which has the property 

of easing the opening of the flexible package, having a softening 
point (VICAT point) less than that of the support layer. The 

flexible package is prepared with said material by welding it at 
different temperatures so as to eliminate the easy-open property 

of the contact layer in the longitudinal and base welds (and 
possibly in part of the mouth weld), while preserving this 

property in the total or remaining mouth weld.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a material in the form of film and a 
method of forming easy-open flexible packages. The material uses 
an already known modified polyolefin as its contact layer, which 
has the property of easing the package opening. The requirement which the market currently places on producers of 
flexible packages for foods and other products is the availability 
of flexible packages of easy-open type, ie such that the final 
user is able to open the mouth of the flexible package (bag or 
envelope) without the aid of scissors or other implements. Certain methods of constructing such easy-open flexible packages 
currently exist. The general concept governing such flexible packages is to cause 
their mouth weld to open by a simple mutually outward pull exerted 
by the user's hand. This is made possible by the use of base 
materials in the form of plastics film formed for this purpose. Easy opening is generally achieved by two methods, one known as 
"burst peel" in which the easy opening of the weld present at the 
mouth is achieved by breakage and simultaneous flaking of the 
surface layer of the weld-forming plastics film from the support 
layer or layers, and the other known as "easy peel" in which the 
easy opening of the weld is enabled by surface incompatibility of 
the weld-forming plastics film.  These two methods therefore derive from the use of two different 
families of constituent materials of the plastics layer by which 
the mouth of the flexible package is welded. In the case of the burst peel method the material generally 
consists of a coextruded film comprising at least two layers of 
polyolefins and ionomers. This film is currently used in single 
component flexible packages (ie consisting only of the 
coextrusion) for containing for example dry food products based on 
cereals in the form of flakes, or in multi-layer packages in which 
for example they form easily removable lids for rigid trays. The drawbacks encountered in packages formed from this material 
are as follows: 
1. On opening the mouth of the flexible package an even light 
force applied by the user can easily also open the longitudinal 
and base welds present in the flexible package (envelope or bag) 
with imaginable consequences, such as the escape or dispersion of 
the contents. This drawback is obviated by inserting the flexible 
package in a cardboard box which limits the possible consequence, 
or by directly printing on the package a warning to exert only a 
small opening force. With materials of this

<CLAIMS>
For flexible packages, a plastics film material formed 
from at least two coextruded layers, one being the contact layer 

consisting of modified polyolefinic plastics material possessing 
the property of easing the opening of the flexible package, 

characterised in that the other layer, for supporting the first, 
consists of polyolefin having a softening point higher than that 

of the contact layer. 
A material as claimed in claim 1, characterised by having 
a thickness of between 40 and 100µ, of which the contact layer 

comprises 5-10µ. 
A material as claimed in the preceding claims, 
characterised by being multi-layer and hence comprising, in 

addition to the coextrusion, other layers such as aluminium, 
polyolefins and polyesters. 
A material as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the softening points of the two 

layers differ by about 15°C or more. 
A material as claimed in one or more of claims 1, 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the support layer is of high density (0.94) 

polyolefin, whereas the contact layer is of low density (not 
exceeding 0.92) modified polyolefin. 
A method for making flexible packages from thermoweldable 
materials in accordance with one or more of the preceding claims, 

said packages being provided with a transverse base weld, a 
longitudinal weld and a transverse mouth weld, characterised in 

that the base and longitudinal weld and possibly part of the mouth 
weld are effected at a temperature such as to nullify the easy-open 

properties of the contact layer, whereas the remaining or 
total mouth weld is effected at a lower temperature such as to 

preserve the easy-open properties of the contact layer. 
A method as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that the 
welds are effected by welding bars, those provided for the 

longitudinal weld, base weld and possibly part of the mouth weld 
being controlled at a temperature which: 


a) lies between 130 and 160°C if the flexible package consists 
only of the coextrusion; 
b) lies between 140 and 200°C if the flexible package consists 
of multi-layer material 

whereas the bar provided for partly or totally welding the mouth 
is controlled at a temperature which: 


a1) lies between 90 and 120°C if the flexible package consists 
only of the coextrusion; 
b1) lies between 100 and 160°C if the flexible package consists 
of multi-layer material. 
A flexible package consisting of a bag or envelope 
comprising a coextrusion in accordance with claim 1, characterised 

in that in the base weld and longitudinal weld the connection is 
essentially formed by the support layer.
