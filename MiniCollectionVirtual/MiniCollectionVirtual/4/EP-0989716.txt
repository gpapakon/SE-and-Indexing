<ABSTRACT>
The called subscriber, is prevented from talking immediately. A state signal is inserted, prior to or during the incoming call signal, which confirms the delay of the connection set-up during or after arrival of the call signal. An information about the state is generated, and transmitted to the caller. Preferably the state signal confirms the necessity and duration of the delay of the connection set-up. The mechanism for such delay, especially for mobile telephones, is fitted with a keyboard and an information transmitter for the necessary delay, and is activated by a key, or key combination. Independent claims are included for a device for carrying out the method.
