<ABSTRACT>
A panel (1) comprising a front surface (2) shaped to simulate a framed-up panel is manufactured by forming a main panel member (4) from a main substrate (7) laminated with a main veneer sheet (10). A front surface (5) of the main panel member (4) is formed and shaped to simulate a pair of stiles (12) and an infill panel (14) and to define rail receiving surfaces (15) at opposite ends of the infill panel (14). Rails (16) each formed from a secondary substrate (20) laminated with a secondary veneer sheet (24) are bonded to the rail receiving surfaces (15) and join the stiles (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a panel and to a method for 
producing the panel having first and second opposite major 
surfaces, the first major surface simulating a framed-up panel of 
the type comprising an infill panel and a pair of spaced apart 
stiles joined by a pair of spaced apart rails which together 
extend around the infill panel. Wood panels of the type which are referred to as framed-up panels 
are used extensively, for example, as apartment doors, doors for 
cabinets, cupboards, panels for coffins, panelling for walls, 
ceilings and the like. In general, such panels comprise a frame 
formed by spaced apart vertical stiles joined by spaced apart 
horizontal rails which together surround an infill panel or a 
plurality of infill panels. Traditionally, the stiles, rails and 
infill panel have been constructed separately from hardwood, such 
as for example, mahogany, oak and the like and then assembled. 
However, due to the relatively high cost of such woods, such 
panels are commonly constructed wholly or partly from a substrate 
of low grade wood, wood particles or chips laminated with a 
veneer sheet. For example, the infill panel may comprise a 
substrate of a low grade wood, for example chipboard, fibre board 
of high, medium or low density, or other suitable substrate 
laminated with a veneer sheet of hardwood, softwood, synthetic 
foil or the like. The stiles and rails may likewise be 
constructed from a similar or different type of substrate 
laminated with a similar or different veneer sheet, or may be of 
hardwood. While such framed-up panels result in a reduction in 
the material cost, nonetheless the labour cost required in 
assembling such panels is relatively high. It is known to produce a framed-up panel using a single sheet of 
low grade wood as a substrate laminated with a veneer sheet of 
hardwood, softwood or synthetic foil. Typically the substrate is 
formed from a sheet of chipboard, medium density fibre board or 
the like. One surface of the substrate is machined to form  
 
simulated stiles, rails and an infill panel. If desired the 
infill panel may simulate a raised infill panel. A single veneer 
sheet is laminated to the formed surface by compression moulding 
the veneer sheet to substrate to follow the contours of the 
formed surface. Alternatively, in cases where the depth of the 
surface of the infill panel below the surface of the stiles and 
rails is relatively shallow, the stiles, rails and infill panel 
may be formed by embossing during lamination of the
