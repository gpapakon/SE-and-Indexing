<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to heat-resistant, highly elastic, abrasion-resistant polyurethane-polyester triblock polyaddition products obtainable by reaction, expediently at a temperature in the range from 180 to 300 DEG C, of     A) at least one thermoplastic polyester and B) at least one thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer preferably having a content of free NCO groups of from 0.5 to 4% by weight and a total content of NCO groups of from 0.75 to 5% by weight, in each case based on the total weight of the thermoplastic polyurethane, which is itself obtainable by reacting organic diisocyanates (Ba) with relatively high-molecular weight polyhydroxyl compounds (Bb) and low-molecular weight chain extenders (Bc) using an NCO characteristic number of greater than 115, to a process for their preparation, and to their use for the production of mouldings.
