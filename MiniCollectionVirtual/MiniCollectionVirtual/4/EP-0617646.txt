<ABSTRACT>
A device on an extruder for the evacuation of air, consisting of a cylinder (1) with a die mounted at one end, the outlet, and a piston (2) designed to move from a position outside the other end, the inlet, to a position inside the cylinder. At the inlet, a separate sealing device (11) is mounted which accompanies the piston when it is retracted from the cylinder. The sealing device consists of a casing (4) with sealing rings (8, 9) mounted on the piston/piston rod (2, 3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an extruder for the evacuation of 
air, where the extruder consists of a cylinder with a die at one end, the outlet, and 
a piston designed to be moved from a position outside the other end, the 
inlet, to a position in the cylinder, a separate sealing device provided at the inlet and which is 
withdrawn with the piston when it is retracted from the cylinder, which sealing device consists 
of a casing with sealing rings mounted on the piston/piston rod. In the production of longitudinal metal sections by the traditional method, a shaping machine of 
the above type is used. A metal billet with a circular cross-section, is pre-heated and placed in 
the cylinder. Then the piston presses the billet through the die with great force. The extrusions 
thus formed take on different shapes depending on the shape of the hole in the die. Work is being done to develop methods of producing metal sections based on the use of 
particulate material such as metal powder or needles. However, when one uses particulate 
material to make a bolt or metal extrusion, there are increased problems with air pockets and 
moist and this detracts from the quality of the extrudate. EP Patent Application No. 0397473 describes a method and equipment for producing metal 
objects by consolidation of particulate material, using an extruder with a solution for the 
evacuation of gas. A piston is used with a wedge, where the gas is sucked out past the wedge 
and through a bore in the piston. This solution gives an end product which is very close to 
optimum - i.e. which to all intents and purposes is without deleterious impurities and pores, and 
which has an almost impermeable surface which prevents absorption of humidity and gas 
during later use.  
 However, there is one disadvantage in the equipment described by the above-mentioned 
Norwegian patent application - that it does not achieve a satisfactory seal between the piston 
and the cylinder, and this in turn means that air is drawn into the cylinder during the extraction 
operation when a strong vacuum is used. Also known is an extruder where air is extracted from the extruder cylinder by means of a 
venting plate which is pressed against a venting ring mounted on the cylinder. The venting 
plate can be moved by means of piston/cylinder mechanisms. This solution is complicated and 
costly. In addition, it requires a great deal of space and would obstruct the movements of 
anyone operating it. Further, FR 2400973 shows an extruder provided with a
