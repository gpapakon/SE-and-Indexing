<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a force balanced, three-way solenoid operated
valve and more particularly to a force balanced, three-way solenoid operated valve
adapted to handle very high pressures (e.g. above 34,5 - 206,8 MPa [5,000 - 30,000
psi]) with extremely fast response time (e.g. 200 - 400 Âµ sec). In detail, the present invention
relates to pressure balanced three-way valve assemblies according to the
preamble of claim 1 and claim 31 respectively.Three-way solenoid valves have long been used for controlling fluid flow in a variety
of air and hydraulic systems, particularly fuel systems. Such three-way solenoid valves
often control the passage of fluid under high pressure from a source to a load
device and selectively interrupt the flow of pressurized fluid while simultaneously
connecting the load device to a substantially unpressurized drain. Typically, a three-way
valve includes a valve housing having first, second and third valve passages interconnected
by an internal valve chamber containing two valve seats and a valve
element movable to control fluid flow among the three valve passages by moving
between
a first position in which the movable valve member engages a first one of the
valve seats to isolate a first one of the valve passages from the internal
chamber while allowing fluid communication between the second and third
valve passages through the second valve seat and internal chamber, anda second position in which the movable valve member engages the second
valve seat to isolate a second one of the valve passages while allowing fluid
communication between the first and third valve passages through the first
valve seat and internal chamber.With prior art three-way valves, and particularly spring biased, solenoid operated valves,
a relatively large magnetic force is usually required when the valve is used to
control high pressure fluids to overcome the spring pressure which is necessary for
maintaining the valve in an initial position prior to energization of the solenoid valve.
To provide an adequate magnetic force, a relatively large, heavy and costly solenoid
is often required. As disclosed in US - A - 2,601,989, three-way valve operation can be improved if the
movable valve member is substantially force balanced. In particular, this reference
discloses a three-way valve which includes two inlets supplying fluid from respective
sources and a single outlet passage where the three-way valve can be positioned to
permit the passage of fluid selectively from one of the two fluid
