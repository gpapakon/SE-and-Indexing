<ABSTRACT>
A pair of lever-operated connectors includes one and 
the other connectors which are connected together by using a 

lever (10), the one connector comprising a connector housing (1) and 
the lever (10) for connecting the two connectors. The lever has 

pins (13). The connector housing (1) of the one connector comprises, 
positioning notches (5) for positioning the pins (13) of 

the lever (10) to 
insert, slanting guide surfaces arranged beneath the notches 

(5) for elastically deforming the lever (10) when inserting 
the pins (13) into the slanting guide surfaces, and bearing holes (6) 

arranged beneath the slanting guide surfaces for receiving 
and pivotally supporting the pins of the lever.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pair of lever-operated connectors
in which connectors are connected together through
leverage of a lever, and the assembly of the lever is improved.A pair of lever-operated connectors, in which connectors
are connected together through leverage of a lever,
has an advantage that connection and disconnection can be
effected with a small force, and this type has been extensively
applied to multi-terminal connectors in which a resistance
produced for fitting terminals together is large.An example of a known connector of this type is shown
in Fig. 13. Bearing holes 72, formed in a lever 70, are
pivotally fitted respectively on a pair of pins 62 formed
respectively on opposite outer sides of a hood portion 61
of a male connector housing 60, thus assembling the lever
70 astride the male connector housing 60.In this conventional connector, the procedure of assembling
the lever will now be described with reference to
Fig. 14. First, as shown in Fig. 14(A), the proximal ends
of arms 71 of the lever 70 are brought into contact with
the pins 62 of the male connector housing 60, respectively,
and then the lever 70 is urged hard against the male connector
housing 60 to cause the pins 62 to be disposed between
the two arms 71, thereby elastically deforming the
two arms 71 away from each other. In this condition, when
the lever 70 is further moved, the bearing holes 72 in the
lever 70 are fitted on the pins 62 of the male connector
housing 60, respectively, as shown in Fig. 14(B).At this time, for elastically deforming the arms 71
held against the pins 62, the lever 70 is urged with a considerably
large force, and therefore the lever 70 moves
vigorously simultaneously when the arms 71 are moved away 
from each other. As a result, the bearing holes 72 sometimes
pass over the pins 62, so that cam grooves 73 are
fitted on the pins 62, respectively, as shown in Fig.
14(C). In this condition, the lever 70 must be once removed,
and then the assembling of the lever must be carried
out again. This requires much time and troublesome work.Furthermore, when the direction of urging of the lever
70 inadvertently deviates from the proper direction, the
position of the pins 62 which are disposed inwardly of the
arms 71, can not be confirmed with the eyes even if the cam
grooves 73 are not fitted on the pins 62, respectively. In
this condition, depending on intuition, the lever 70 must
be moved in the proper direction in search for the position
of the pins 62 so that the bearing holes 72 can be fitted
respec
