<ABSTRACT>
Thermally processable imaging elements in 
which the image is formed by imagewise heating or by 

imagewise exposure to light followed by uniform heating 
and in which a polyalkoxysilane is incorporated in the 

imaging composition to provide enhanced adhesion are 
protected against undesirable width-wise curling by 

interposing a barrier layer between the support and the 
image-forming layer. The barrier layer, which is 

composed of poly(silicic acid) and a water-soluble 
hydroxyl-containing monomer or polymer that is 

compatible therewith prevents migration from the image-forming 
layer to the support of by-products of 

hydrolysis of the polyalkoxysilane which can cause 
width-wise curl and consequent jamming of processing 

equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to imaging 
elements and in particular to thermally processable 
imaging elements. More specifically, this invention 
relates to imaging elements comprising a thermographic 
or photothermographic layer which include a protective 
overcoat layer and which are protected against 
undesirable-width-wise curling. Thermally processable imaging elements, 
including films and papers, for producing images by 
thermal processing are well known. These elements 
include photothermographic elements in which an image 
is formed by imagewise exposure of the element to light 
followed by development by uniformly heating the 
element. These elements also include thermographic 
elements in which an image is formed by imagewise 
heating the element. Such elements are described in, 
for example, Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 
17029 and U.S. Patents 3,080,254, 3,457,075 and 
3,933,508. An important feature of the aforesaid 
thermally processable imaging elements is a protective 
overcoat layer. To be fully acceptable, a protective 
overcoat layer for such imaging elements should: (a) 
provide resistance to deformation of the layers of the 
element during thermal processing, (b) prevent or 
reduce loss of volatile components in the element 
during thermal processing, (c) reduce or prevent 
transfer of essential imaging components from one or 
more of the layers of the element into the overcoat 
layer during manufacture of the element or during 
storage of the element prior to imaging and thermal  
 
processing, (d) enable satisfactory adhesion of the 
overcoat to a contiguous layer of the element, and (e) 
be free from cracking and undesired marking, such as 
abrasion marking, during manufacture, storage, and 
processing of the element. A particularly preferred overcoat for 
thermally processable imaging elements is an overcoat 
comprising poly(silicic acid) as described in U.S. 
Patent 4,741,992, issued May 3, 1988. Advantageously, 
water-soluble hydroxyl-containing monomers or polymers 
are incorporated in the overcoat layer together with 
the poly(silicic acid). The combination of 
poly(silicic acid) and a water-soluble hydroxyl-containing 
monomer or polymer that is compatible with 
the poly(silicic acid) is also useful in a backing 
layer on the side of the support opposite to the 
imaging layer as described in U.S. Patent 4,828,971, 
issued May 9, 1989. One of the most difficult problems involved 
in the manufacture of thermally processable imaging 
elements is that the
