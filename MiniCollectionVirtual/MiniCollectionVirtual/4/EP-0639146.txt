<ABSTRACT>
A tubular package for several objects (B) has two sidewalls (200, 300), two substantially horizontal walls (one covering wall 100 and one bottom wall 400a, 400b) and two opposite frontal openings with two retaining strips (500, 600) which extend substantially across the frontal openings. Each retaining strip is joined at one end to a side wall by a joining area (520, 530, 620, 630) inwardly folded against the sidewall and held in that position by one of the packaged objects. Each joining area extends a considerably width along one edge of the corresponding lateral area (200, 300), at least up to the first substantially horizontal wall (400a, 400b), and is held under pressure in the folded position between one end area of an adjacent object (B) and the corresponding sidewall.

Wrap-around pack for a number of objects (B), with two side panels (200,
300), a top panel (100), a base panel (400a, 400b) and two end openings

located opposite each other, in each of which a retaining strip (500, 600) is
provided that extends essentially across the end openings and is hinged to a

side panel at each end by a hinge section (520, 530, 620, 630), where the
hinge section is folded inwards against the side panel and is secured in this

position by one of the packaged objects, where the hinge areas (520, 530,
620, 630) extend across most of the height of the objects and at least down to

the base panel (400a, 400b) and where the top end of the hinge areas (520,
530, 620, 630) ends directly before oblique intermediate panels (120, 130)

that are located between the side panels (200, 300) and the top panel (100),

wherein
 each hinge area (520, 530, 620, 630) has a cut-out (520a, 530a,
620a, 630a; 522a, 532a, 622a, 632a) at its bottom end, the edge of which -

after the pack has been formed - rests on the edge of a notch (E1, E3, E4, E6)
that is provided in the lower section of the side panels (200, 300) to

accommodate the base area of the objects.
Pack according to claim 1, 
wherein
 each hinge area is provided with an
extension (523, 533, 623, 633) that - after the pack has been formed - extends

inwards against the base panel (400a, 400b) and is held in this position by the
object in the pack.
Pack according to claim 2, 
wherein
 the extension (523, 533, 623, 633) is
hinged to the hinge area along a folding line (L13) which - after the pack has 

been formed - rests essentially on a folding line (L7, L8) that connects the side
panel (200, 300) to the base panel (400a, 400b).
Pack according to one of the previous claims, 
wherein
 each hinge area (520,
530, 620, 630) is connected to the edge of the relevant retaining strip (500,

600) by two hinged and essentially triangular connecting sections (524, 525;
534, 535; 624, 625; 634, 635).
