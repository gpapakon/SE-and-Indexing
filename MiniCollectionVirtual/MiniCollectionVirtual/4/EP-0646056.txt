Method of actuating a percussion drilling tool or 
chisel of 
a drilling or chiselling hammer by means of a 
free piston (4), which is moved to and fro in a cavity 

(2.8) by compressed air, characterised in that the 
compressed air is produced by means of an elongate rotating 

outside rotor (3) and an elongate inside rotor (2), which 
rotates in said outside rotor about an eccentric axis of 

rotation (2.9) at a relative speed, a compression chamber 
and a suction chamber being formed by the rotation 

alternately between radially offset, axially extended 
partial areas (A, B) of the external periphery of the 

inside rotor (2) and a facing portion of the internal wall 
of the outside rotor (3), the compression chamber being 

produced at one partial area, while the suction chamber is 
produced at the other partial area, and in that the air 

from the compression chamber is urged into the axially 
orientated cavity (2.8) in the interior of the inside rotor 

(2) through at least a first guide channel situated on the 
facing partial area of the external periphery of the inside 

rotor (2) close to its one axial end, while air from the 
cavity (2.8) is drawn into the suction chamber through at 

least an additional guide channel situated at the radially 
offset partial area of the external periphery of the inside 

rotor (2) close to its other axial end, whereby the free 
pis6ton (4) is moved to and fro between the first guide 

channel (2.1) and the additional guide channel (2.2). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the inside rotor (2) and outside rotor (3) rotate with a 

speed ratio of 1:2, and in that the compression chamber and 
the suction chamber are formed on diametrically opposed 

partial areas (A, B) of the external periphery of the 
inside rotor (2).  

 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the inside rotor (2) and outside rotor (3) are 

electrically driven. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that an air cushion is formed during the 

return stroke of the free piston (4) behind at least the 
one additional guide channel, and the impact is reduced by 

said cushion. 
Striking mechanism for a striking or rotationally 
striking tool, having a component part with a cavity in 

which a to-and-fro displaceable free piston (4) is guided, 
at least one guide channel (2.1, 2.2) terminating in the 

cavity (2.8) close to its axial ends, characterised in that 
the component part is configured as a rotatingly driven 

inside rotor (2), which is disposed in an outside rotor 
(3), which is rotatingly driven at a relative speed 

relative to the inside rotor (2), in that the axes of 
rotation (2.9, 3.5) of the inside rotor (2) and outside 

rotor (3) are disposed parallel and eccentrically to each 
other, and in that the external configuration of the inside 

rotor (2) and the internal configuration of the outside 
rotor (3) are so adapted to each other that, during the 

rotation, the guide channels (2.1, 12.2), which are 
situated close to the axial ends of the inside rotor (2), 

are alternately connected to a compression chamber, which 
is formed between the external configuration of the inside 

rotor (2) and the internal configuration of the outside 
rotor (3), and a suction chamber thereby being formed. 
Striking mechanism according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the speed ratio between inside rotor 

(2) and outside rotor (3) is 1:2, and in that the 
compression chamber and the suction chamber are formed on 

diametrically opposed partial areas of the external 
configuration of the inside rotor (2).  

 
Striking mechanism according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that the cross-section (3.4) of the 

outside rotor (3) has an elliptical configuration, its 
central axis being offset parallel to the axis of rotation 

(3.5) of the outside rotor (3), in that the inside rotor 
(2) has a small external diameter and a large external 

diameter, so that the large external diameter almost 
corresponds to the smaller internal diameter of the 

elliptical cross-section (3.4) of the outside rotor (3), 
while the small external diameter is so selected that one 

of the two partial areas (A, B) of the external 
configuration of the inside rotor (2) associated therewith 

lies close to the wall of the outside rotor (3) when the 
direction of the small external diameter corresponds with 

the direction of the eccentric offset arrangement of the 
two axes of rotation (2.9, 3.5).
