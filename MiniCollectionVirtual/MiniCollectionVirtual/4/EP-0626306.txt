Power steering mechanism for supplying pressure oil to
left and right chambers (6, 7) of a servo-cylinder (3)

via a rotary slide valve (9) with a pump (10), there
being disposed between an input shaft (14) and a

control sleeve (15) of the rotary slide valve (9) a
reaction piston (18), which is loadable at the front

end by a return pressure, supported in an axially
movable and non-rotatable manner on the input shaft

(14) and connected by a resilient rotational coupling
to the control sleeve (15), wherein a leakage oil bore

is disposed at the rear end of a sealing piston (20)
in the input shaft (14),
characterized in

that
 the reaction piston (18) is loadable at a rear
end with parameter-dependently regulated reaction

pressure and an electro-hydraulic converter EHC (30)
for regulating the reaction torque by means of the

ratio of return pressure and regulated reaction
pressure is inserted into a line (31) between the pump

(10) and the rear end of the reaction piston (18).
Power steering mechanism according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 a cut-off valve ASV (33) for
limiting the maximum reaction pressure is inserted

between the line (31) leading to the rear end of the
reaction piston (18) and the line leading to the tank

(27).
Power steering mechanism according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 a relief bore (32) is disposed
between a reaction chamber (28) and the interior of

the input shaft (14).
