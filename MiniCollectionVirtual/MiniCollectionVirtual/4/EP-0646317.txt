<ABSTRACT>
A shuttle (40) for advancing the free end of a flat sleeve of casing 
(C) onto a stuffing horn (10) 

includes a bore (56) therethrough and a vacuum manifold (84) which causes 
the casing to 

expand into gripping relationship with the bore, to permit the shuttle 
and casing end 

to be advanced onto the horn. When vacuum is released from the manifold, 
the casing 

is released from the gripping relation with the shuttle bore and 
moves towards a 

gripping relation with the horn, which is increased by reducing 
the pressure in the 

horn. This permits the shuttle to be withdrawn at least sufficiently 
to apply a casing 

brake (18) to lock the casing to the horn. The shuttle is also used to 
consolidate meat 

stuffed into the casing by locking the casing to the shuttle with 
the vacuum manifold 

and moving the shuttle away from a restricting orifice surrounding the 
casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and method for automatically connecting
tubular casing stored in a flat form onto a tubular horn through which meat is stuffed into
the casing.De-boned whole muscle meat, for example as is used in the preparation of
hams, is commonly sealed within a tubular casing. In one form of apparatus, the casing
is shirred, and an appreciable length is placed on a tubular horn through which the meat
is stuffed by extrusion into the casing, in a manner generally similar to that in which
sausages are formed. This method is relatively labour intensive, and the shirred casing is
relatively expensive. In accordance with a second method, the casing is stored in a flat
condition in a roll, and the apparatus includes a shuttle which automatically connects the
free end of the casing to the stuffing horn. Typically, in accordance with this second
method, as exemplified by the DE-A-2411020, the shuttle comprises an outer tubular
member and an inner core member coaxially mounted in fixed relation to the outer member
by a roller arrangement, and the casing passes between the two members. In this second 
method, difficulty is experienced in engaging the leading edge of the casing with the free
end of the horn. In accordance with one proposal, as exemplified in the document
aforesaid, the outlet end of the stuffing horn is conically tapered to a diameter which is
appreciably less than that of a the casing so as to facilitate the engagement of the free end
of the casing therewith. The reduced diameter of the horn end increases the difficulty of
filling the casing. In accordance with a second proposal, as illustrated in the EP-A-0203745
fingers are used to expand the free end of the casing, and an extensible stuffing horn is
inserted into the casing end when expanded in this manner. This type of apparatus is
mechanically complex, and leakage of meat juices past the fingers is sometimes
experienced.It is generally desirable to consolidate the meat within the casing, and in all
variations of the second method that have been proposed prior hereto, special adjustment
cylinders are used in this consolidation step which serve to draw the stuffed casing
rearwardly through a consolidation orifice. It would be preferable to use the shuttle both
for advancing the casing onto the horn, and for drawing the stuffed casing through a
consolidating orifice.It is an object of this invention to provide improved apparatus of this second
type.It is another object of this invention to provide apparatus which does
