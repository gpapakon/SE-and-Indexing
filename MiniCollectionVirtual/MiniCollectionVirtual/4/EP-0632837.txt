<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a purification process. In industrial processes materials may be encountered which 
contain unwanted haloalkanoic acids which contain 2 to 6 for 
example 2 to 4 carbon atoms or amides or esters thereof in 
which at least one carbon atom especially the α-carbon atom is 
bound to a halogen, especially chlorine, atom, which materials 
preferably contain only one halogen atom (herein referred to as 
HAAs), for example chloroacetic acid. We have found that dehalogenase enzymes, especially those 
derived from Pseudomonas are remarkably effective in decomposing 
such substances in the presence of high concentrations of 
carboxymethyl cellulose, surface active agents and thioglycollic 
acid salts, in for example concentrations of 5%, 10% or more for 
example 50% or more in water, all percentages being by weight. Certain surface active agents (surfactants) are made by 
processes which comprise reacting active hydrogen atoms with 
haloalkanoic acids or esters or amides thereof as aforesaid. Such 
surface active agents may comprise carboxy alkyl groups or esters 
or amides thereof, for example groups of formula R(AO)n OZCOOH in 
which R is an alkyl phenyl or preferably alkyl group containing 8 
to 20 and preferably 9 to 18 carbon atoms, n has a value of 1 to 
20 and preferably 1½ to 20 and is preferably 2 to 12 and 
represents an average value, AO is one or more alkylene oxide 
groups which preferably comprise ethylene and/or propylene oxide 
groups and may consist essentially of such groups, and Z is an 
alkylene group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example a CH2 
group. Residues of the HAAs may remain in the product as an 
impurity however and it may be desired to remove them. The invention comprises a process in which free haloalkanoic  
 
acids or esters or amides thereof as aforesaid are decomposed in 
the presence of a surfactant which comprises a carboxyalkyl group 
or an ester or amide thereof, carboxymethyl cellulose or of a 
thioglycollic acid salt by contacting it with a dehalogenase 
enzyme which may be a dehydrohalogenase enzyme. The haloalkanoic acid is suitably a chloroalkanoic acid for 
example chloroacetic acid.The process is suitably carried out at a pH of 6 to 9 the 
temperature is suitably 15 - 40°C. Sufficient enzyme is preferably present to enable the 
process to be completed within two days. The rate may be 
increased by increasing the quantity of enzyme present, and the 
process may be completed more rapidly by this means. The process is suitably carried out at a

<CLAIMS>
A process in which a free haloalkanoic acid containing 2 to 
6 carbon atoms or an ester or amide thereof is decomposed in 

the presence of a surfactant which comprises a carboxyalkyl 
group or an ester or amide thereof, carboxymethyl cellulose 

or a thioglycollic acid salt by contacting it with a 
dehalogenase enzyme. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 in which the surfactant is 
of formula R(AO)n OZCOOH in which R is an alkylphenyl or 

alkyl group having 8 to 20 carbon atoms, n has a value of 1½ 
to 20, AO is an alkylene oxide residue, n is an average 

value and Z is an alkylene group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. 
A process as claimed in either preceeding claim in which 
haloalkanoic acid is a chloroalkanoic acid. 
A process as claimed in Claim 3 in which the haloalkanoic 
acid is chloroacetic acid. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which the pH 
is 6 to 9 and the temperature is 15 to 40°C. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim which is carried 
out at a concentration of 5% or more of carboxymethyl 

cellulose, thioglycollic acid salt or surface active agent 
in water. 
A process of producing a surfactant, thioglycollic acid salt 
or carboxymethyl cellulose which comprises reacting a 

substance having reactive hydrogen atoms with a haloalkanoic 
acid to form a carboxyalkyl derivative thereof and 

decomposing residual haloalkanoic acid in the product by 
contacting it with a dehalogenase enzyme. 
A process as claimed in Claim 7 in which the residual 
haloalkanoic acid is decomposed as claimed in a process as 

claimed in any of Claims 1 to 6.  
 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which the 
enzyme is a dehydrohalogenase. 
A composition which comprises a surfactant, thioglycollic 
acid or carboxymethyl cellulose 
and initially a haloalkanoic 
acid
 and a dehalogenase enzyme in an amount sufficient 
substantially to reduce the concentration of 
the
 
haloalkanoic acid. 
A process or composition as claimed in any preceding claim 
in which the surfactant is of formula R(AO)
n
 OZ COOH in 
which AO is an ethylene oxide and/
or propylene oxide residue 

and in which R, A, n and Z are as defined in Claim 2.
