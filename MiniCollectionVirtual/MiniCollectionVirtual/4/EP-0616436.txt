<ABSTRACT>
In an earth-based receiving station for receiving radio 
signals transmitted from a satellite relay station, a common first 

frequency converter (2) and at least two receivers (4a, 4b, 4c) are provided. 
One of the receivers (4a) is used as a control receiver to receive a CSC carrier 

frequency transmitted from the satellite, to generate a first local 
oscillator frequency phase-locked to the CSC carrier frequency, and 

to supply the first local oscillator frequency to the common first 
frequency converter (2). Other receivers (4c) are used as channel receivers 

for receiving channel frequencies. In case when the control 
receiver is in trouble, any other receiver can be used as a control 

receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an earth-based receiving station for
receiving radio signals from a satellite relay station.In an SCPC(Single Channel Per Carrier) system used as a
satellite communication system, voice channels are allocated with
45kHz separation. Since this separation is very narrow for high
carrier frequencies in GHz band, and since utmost frequency
accuracy is required for demodulating PSK modulated signals used in
satellite communication, frequency tuning should be very accurate
in receivers for receiving these channels.In an SPADE(Single channel per carrier PCM multiple Access
Demand assignment Equipment)system, the control station assigns a
communication channel in accordance to access demand from an
earth-based transmitting station. For this demand/assign
communication between the control station and earth-based
communication stations, a CSC(common signalling channel) is used.In order to facilitate accurate tuning, the CSC is continually
transmitted from the control station.Earth-based transmitting stations transmit access demand
signals to the control station by CSC in the up-linked channels.Earth-based receiving stations in the system are listening CSC
transmitted from the control station, and when the control station
assigns a receiving channel by CSC to a receiving station, the
receiving station tunes a channel receiver frequency to the
assigned channel. All the communication channels are transmitted in burst type
waves.Fig. 2 illustrate a block diagram of such receiving station of
a prior art.Radio frequency signals received by an antenna 1 are converted
to first intermediate frequency signals by a first frequency
converter 2. The first intermediate frequency signals from the
converter 2 are supplied through a distributor 3 to a control
receiver 5 and a channel receiver 6.Same numerals in the receivers 5 and 6 indicate same parts, and
as for receiver discrimination, a numeral indicating the receiver
is connected by a hyphen.The control receiver 5 receives the CSC, phase-locks a VCO 44
to the CSC carrier frequency, and delivers output of the VCO 44 as
a first local oscillator frequency to the converter 2. A phase-lock
loop for the VCO 44 is a closed circuit comprising VCO 44, first
frequency converter 2, second frequency converter 40-5, second
intermediate frequency amplifier 41-5, demodulator 42-5,
low-pass-filter 43, VCO 44. Frequency synthesizer 48-5 supplies a
second local oscillator frequency to the second frequency converter
40-5.When the CSC carrier frequency is Fpr, the
