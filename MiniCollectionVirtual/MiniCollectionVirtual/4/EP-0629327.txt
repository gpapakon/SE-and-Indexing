<DESCRIPTION>
Telephone headsets are an important element of modern business equipment. They provide 
hands-free communication, and improve productivity, in a variety of applications, such as operator 
and information services. One of the main applications of telephone headsets is in connection with automatic in-bound and 
out-bound telephone systems. Such systems generally include an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD). 
In a telephone system with an ACD, a computer automatically routes telephone calls to workstations 
connected to the system in a way that balances the call load equally between the workstations. Each 
workstation can be occupied by a telephone representative. For a telephone system with ACD to 
work properly, each telephone representative is required to log on to the system each time he/she 
occupies his/her workstation, and to log off the system each time he/she leaves his/her workstation. 
This is necessary so that the ACD will route calls to all occupied workstations, and will not route 
calls to any unoccupied workstations. If a representative leaves his/her workstation without logging 
off, the ACD system will continue to route calls to that workstation. Such calls are not responded 
to, or a response is delayed. A representative failing to log on to the system increases the load on 
the other representatives, and increases the time required to respond to incoming calls. The failure 
of a representative either to log on to or log off the system consequently results in a reduced quality 
of service. The need for a telephone system to determine whether a workstation is occupied is not restricted 
to telephone systems with an ACD. For example, the sole telephone operator in a small office is also 
required to log off when away from his/her workstation so that incoming calls do not go unanswered. To improve the quality of service provided by telephone systems in which the presence of a 
representative or operator at a workstation impacts the quality of service, it is desirable that logging 
on and logging off be automated. A typical workstation includes a telephone headset connected to an amplifier. The amplifier is, 
in turn, connected to the workstation, which is connected to the telephone system. The amplifier is 
powered by current drawn from the telephone system. Automated log on/log off systems are known 
in which the representative has to unplug the amplifier from the workstation to log off automatically. 
The automatic log on/log off system monitors each workstation to determine whether or not
