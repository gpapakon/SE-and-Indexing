<ABSTRACT>
The handle for medical instruments, especially for guiding instruments (9) into a body cavity, comprises adjacent segments (5, 6) which are hollow on the inside and form handle sections. The position of these segments can be adjusted via control wires (10, 11, 12, 13), so that different handle curvatures can be adjusted, at least two groups (2, 3) of segments being adjustable independently of one another. The segments (5) of a first (2), distal group are articulated to one another, and the proximally adjoining segments (6) of a second group (3) are non-positively connected to one another, the segments of the second group being tensioned with a variably adjustable spring force.

A shaft (1) for medical instruments, in particular for guiding instruments 
(9) into a body cavity, in which for the purpose of adjusting curvatures in the 

shaft, adjacent, internally hollow segments (5, 6) forming shaft sections are 
adjustable in their position by means of control wires (10, 11; 12, 13), in which 

at least two groups (2, 3) of segments (5, 6) are adjustable independently of 
each other and the segments (5) of a first, distally provided group (2) are 

connected articulatedly with each other, characterised in that the segments (6) 
of the second group (3), adjoining each other in proximal direction, are able to 

be braced in a force-fitting manner with a variably adjustable elastic force and 
are able to be connected in a form-fitting manner through mutual engagement. 
A shaft according to Claim 1, characterised in that the segments (6) of 
the second group (3) are held together with bracing wires (10, 11), the distal 

ends of which are fastened to the distal segment (6a) of the second group (3), 
whilst the bracing wires (14, 15) run in a proximal direction through a rigid shaft 

piece (4) and the proximal bracing wire ends are feed in a bracing device (16) 
inside a handle (7). 
A shaft according to Claim 2, characterised in that the bracing device (16) 
consists of two mountings (17, 18) for a spring (19), which holds the two 

mountings (17, 18) at a distance from each other, in which the distal mounting 
(18) has a region (18a) constructed with a thread, which region (18a) is turned 

into a counter-thread (7a) of the handle (7), that the proximal ends of the 
bracing wires (14, 15) are fastened to the proximal mounting (17) and that the 

distal ends of the bracing wires (14, 15), guided through bores in the segments 
(6) of the second group (3), are secured on the distally last segment (6a) of this 

group.  
 
A shaft according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
segments (5, 6) of the two groups (2, 3) are adjustable by control wires (10, 11; 

12, 13) via two adjusting devices (20, 21) inside the handle (7). 
A shaft according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 

segments (5) of the first group (2) have at one end two circular projections (22) 
and at the other end equivalent recesses (23), which in each case lie 

diametrically opposite each other, and that in each case the projections (22) of a 
segment (5) are fitted into the corresponding recesses (23) of a following 

segment (5) and the two segments (5) are connected with each other in 
an axially articulated manner. 
A shaft according to one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised in that control 
wires (10, 11) are fastened by their distal ends on the last segment (5a) - on the 

distal side - of the first group (2). 
A shaft according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
segments (6) of the second group (3) have at one end semicircular projections 

(25) lying diametrically opposite each other, the circumference of which is 
constructed in an undulating shape, and at the other end have equivalent 

recesses (26), in which undulation peaks (27) of the projections (25) of a 
segment (6) always engage in undulation troughs (28) of the recesses (26) of a 

following segment (6). 
A shaft according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
segments (6) of the second group (3) at one end have substantially semicircular 

projections (25) lying diametrically opposite each other in each case, the 
circumference of which is constructed in an undulating shape, and at the other 

end have semicircular recesses (26), in which detent pins (29) of each segment 
(6), which are arranged in each case in the centre of the arc line of each recess  

 
(26), are engaged into the undulating projections (25) of a following segment 

(6). 
A shaft according to Claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the distally last 
segment (6a) of the second group (3) in the region of its recesses (26) is 

connected in an axially articulated manner with the projections (22) of the 
following segment (5) of the first group (2). 
A shaft according to one of Claims 7 to 9, characterised in that the distal 
end of a proximal rigid shaft piece (4) is provided with recesses (26) to receive 

the projections (25) of the proximally last segment (6b) of the second group (3).
