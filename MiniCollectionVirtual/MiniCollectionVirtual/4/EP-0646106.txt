<CLAIMS>
A process for the simultaneous production of dicarboxylic
acids and diamines from


(a) polymers based on polyamides of dicarboxylic acids
or their derivatives with diamines, or
(b) materials comprising essentially such polymers,

which comprises

(1) cracking these polymers into their monomeric constituents
using a base in an alcohol-water mixture

comprising from 5 to 40% by weight of water to
obtain a liquid phase and a solid phase,
(2) separating the solid phase from the liquid phase to
obtain a liquid phase comprising the diamine, and
(3) electrochemically converting the resulting dicarboxylic
acid salts of adipic acid or sebacic acid

into the corresponding dicarboxylic acids and bases.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
electrochemical conversion is carried out in a three- or

four-part membrane electrolysis cell at a temperature
within the range from 65 to 90°C.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
electrochemical conversion is carried out in an electrodialysis

unit consisting of three compartments at a
temperature within the range from 40 to 110°C.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the adipic acid or sebacic acid is crystallized

out from their solutions obtained by the electrochemical
treatment.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the base obtained in the electrochemical treatment

is used for cracking the polymers into their 
monomeric constituents.
The use of a process as claimed in any of claims 1
to 5 for the regeneration cracking of polyamides into

their monomeric constituents.
