<ABSTRACT>
A method of making an electrically conductive polyurethane elastomer that is 
substantially free of bubbles and foreign particles comprising:

 
   forming a prepolymer of a polyol and an isocyanate, forming a liquid mixture of an 

ionic conductive additive and amounts of cross linking agent and chain extenders sufficient to 
provide a crosslinked elastomer;

 
   filtering the liquid mixture of additive, crosslinking agents and chain extenders to 

remove foreign particles;
 

   preheating the liquid mixture to a temperature below the decomposition 
temperature and above the melting temperature of the additive, crosslinking agents and chain 

extenders in a degassing oven to degass to less than 5 mm of mercury to break any bubbles in 
the mixture and remove moisture;

 
   to a vacuum reactor mixer having two input ports, adding the prepolymer and the 

preheated degassed liquid mixture and mixing under a vacuum of less than 5 mm of mercury of 
a period of time to provide a uniform mixture:

 
   removing the mixture from the vacuum reactor mixer and forming it into the desired 

shape; and
 

   curing the formed shape to an elastomer substantially free of bubbles and foreign 
particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making an electrically conductive
polyurethane elastomer, and in particular, to one which is substantially free of bubbles and
foreign particles. It has particular application as a bias transfer member in transferring toner
from an electrostatographic imaging surface to a receiving surface such as a sheet of paper. It
has additional application as a conductive intermediate transfer belt or as a transport member.In the process of electrophotographic printing, a photoconductive surface is charged
to a substantially uniform potential. The photoconductive surface is image wise exposed to
record an electrostatic latent image corresponding to the informational areas of an original
document being reproduced. This records an electrostatic latent image on the
photoconductive surface corresponding to the informational areas contained within the
original document. Thereafter, a developer material is transported into contact with the
electrostatic latent image. Toner particles are attracted from the carrier granules of the
developer material onto the latent image. The resultant toner powder image is then
transferred from the photoconductive surface to a sheet of support material and permanently
affixed thereto.This process is well known and useful for light lens copying from an original and in
printing applications from electronically generated or stored originals.In a reproduction process of the type as described above, it is common practice today
to use a biased transfer member to transfer the developed image from the photoconductor to
the final support material such as a sheet of paper. Typically, these biased transfer members
take the form of a roll and are comprised of a polyester based polyurethane with an additive to
control resistivity such as tetraheptyl ammonium bromide.US-A-3,959,574 to Seanor et al. describes additional quarternary ammonium
compounds for controlling the resistivity of the elastomeric polyurethanes. US-A-5,259,989 and
US-A-5,259,990 describe polyether based polyurethanes containing an asymmetric ionic
quarternary ammonium salt which has an extended useful electrical life. The transport belts
which may be useful in the practice of the present invention may be similar to those described
in US-A-3,931,090 to Amatangelo and in US-A-4,314,006 to Lentz et al.While capable of performing satisfactorily certain difficulties do appear in the
manufacture of the rolls and belts. In particular, undissolved particles frequently appear in the
polyurethane
