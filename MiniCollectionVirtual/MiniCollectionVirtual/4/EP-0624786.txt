<ABSTRACT>
A device for detecting photometric data arranged side by side and/or successively on a sheet-like or strip-like original is equipped at least with a reemission-measurement arrangement (4) having reemission measurement optics (41) for measuring opaque originals (for example test paper strips for checking paper developing baths and/or for monitoring the printer base setting). Wavelength-dispersive elements arranged in the optical path of the reemission light allow analysis of the measurement fields in terms of wavelengths, preferably in the three primary colours red, green and blue. The device (1) is equipped with an automatic conveyor apparatus for the sheet-type or strip-type originals, which apparatus is arranged behind the measurement optics (41) in the conveying direction. The originals are inserted into the machine through an insertion opening (3) which is designed for various widths of original. At least on one side of the insertion opening (3), at least one stop (31) for the originals is provided. Each stop (31) is fixed in position with respect to the insertion slot (3) for the originals. The reemission-measurement optics (41) and the original gripped by the conveyor device and conveyed in the longitudinal direction can be moved relative to one another transversely to the insertion direction. In this way it is possible to measure even adjacent measurement-field columns, without requiring the original to be repositioned between the individual measurements.
