<ABSTRACT>
An exercise device (10) has a rigid body (12) defining a chamber, at least one first fluid mass (22) disposed to move within the chamber in response to movement of the rigid body during exercise, thereby increasing the effective mass of the device, one or more handles (30, 32) for gripping the device and a set of one or more weight adjusting elements (36) that can be removably attached to the rigid body in order to adjust the static base weight of the exercise device.

<DESCRIPTION>
 EXERCISE APPARATUS Background of the Invention The invention relates to exercise devices. It has been known in exercise to seek enhanced results by use of devices of the type consisting of a hollow body containing a dynamic volume of fluid. For example, Johnson U.S. 3,756,592 and U.S. 3,843,117 describe an exercise apparatus consisting of a hollow, rigid containing a fluent mass, e.g. sand, with handles and a method for use of such a device by women after child birth. Piccini U.S. 4,378,113 describes a similar device consisting of a hollow club into which a volume, e.g., of water is introduced and a method for use of the device by baseball players for warming-up wrists. Blome U.S. 4,659,078 describes a sling-like exercise device defining a flexible, fluid-filled enclosure for dynamically exercising muscles.Summary of the Invention According to the invention, an exercise device comprises a rigid body defining a first chamber having a first predetermined volume, a first fluid mass disposed within the first chamber, the first fluid mass having a second predetermined volume which is less than the first predetermined volume, and the first fluid mass being adapted to move within the chamber in response to movement of the rigid body during exercise, handle means for gripping the exercise device during exercise, and a set of one or more weight adjusting elements, the exercise device further comprising means for removable attachment of the weight adjusting elements to the device, whereby the exercise device has a static base weight adjustable by the user by selection of the weight adjusting elements for attachment to the exercise device. 

 Preferred embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the following additional features. The exercise device defines at least one weight adjusting cavity sized to removably retain a weight adjusting element therein.In one preferred embodiment of an exercise device of the invention, e.g. suitable for use of two hands, the rigid body comprises an elongated cylinder having a side wall and opposed end walls, the exercise device further comprises a pair of end caps attached at the end walls of the rigid body, and the handle means comprises a pair of handle elements, each handle element attached to an outer surface of an end cap. Preferably, the weight adjusting cavity is defined by an end cap. More preferably, the end cap further comprises a cover removably attachable to secure a weight adjusting element within the cavity. The outer surfaces of the end caps are convex

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIM IS:
1. An exercise device comprising a rigid body defining a first chamber having a first predetermined volume, a first fluid mass disposed within said first chamber, said first fluid mass having a second predetermined volume, said second predetermined volume being less than said first predetermined volume, and said first fluid mass being adapted to move within said chamber in response to movement of said rigid body during exercise, handle means for gripping of said exercise device during exercise, and a set of one or more weight adjusting elements, said exercise device further comprising means for removable attachment of one or more of said weight adjusting elements to said device, whereby said exercise device has a static base weight adjustable by the user by selection of said weight adjusting elements for attachment to said exercise device.
2. The exercise device of claim 1 wherein said exercise device defines at least one weight adjusting cavity sized to removably retain a weight adjusting element therein.
3. The exercise device of claim 2 wherein said rigid body comprises an elongated cylinder having a side wall and opposed end walls, said exercise device further comprises a pair of end caps attached at said end walls of said rigid body, and said handle means comprises a pair of handle elements, each said handle element attached to an outer surface of a said end cap. 


 4. The exercise device of claim 3 wherein said at least one weight adjusting cavity is defined by a said end cap.
5. The exercise device of claim 4 wherein said end cap further comprises a cover removably attachable to secure a said weight adjusting element within a said weight adjusting cavity.
6. The exercise device of claim 3 wherein said outer surfaces of said end caps are convex surfaces.
7. The exercise device of claim 6 wherein said handle element comprises a strap adapted for adjustable attachment across a user's hand gripped upon said convex surface of said end cap.
8. The exercise device of claim 2 wherein said rigid body comprises an elongated, arcuate member having a side wall, a first end and a second end, and said handle means comprises an elongated handle end cap member extending between said first end and said second end and defining a handle surface.
9. The exercise device of claim 8 wherein said at least one weight adjusting cavity is defined by said handle end cap member.
10. The exercise device of claim 9 wherein said handle end cap member further comprises a cover removably attachable to secure a said weight adjusting element within a said weight adjusting cavity. 


 - lO - ll. The exercise device of claim 1 wherein said rigid body is formed of translucent or transparent material, whereby movement of fluid within said first chamber may be observed during exercise.
12. The exercise device of claim 11 further comprising a second fluid mass disposed within said first chamber, said first fluid mass and said second fluid mass being substantially immiscible.
13. The exercise device of claim 12 wherein said first fluid mass and said second fluid mass have contrasting visual appearance.
14. The exercise device of claim 1 further comprising baffle elements arranged within said first chamber in a manner to retard movement of fluid therewithin.
