<ABSTRACT>
A method of disinfecting or sterilising tissues of the oral cavity or a wound or lesion in the oral cavity comprises applying a photosensitising compound to said tissues, wound or lesion and irradiating said tissues, wound or lesion with laser light at a wavelength absorbed by said photosensitising compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of photosensitising compounds in the manufacture of a medicament for use
in killing microbes involved in a number of oral diseases by irradiation with laser light. Such diseases include inflammatory
periodontal diseases and wound infections.Inflammatory periodontal diseases are the most prevalent diseases of humans and the advanced form, chronic
periodontitis, is the major cause of tooth loss in adults. Current methods of treating chronic periodontitis involve removal
of subgingival plaque in order to eliminate the causative organisms; this is often supplemented by antimicrobial chemotherapy.
Mechanical removal of plaque is never fully successful and there are many disadvantages in the long-term
use of antimicrobial agents such as chlorhexidine and tetracycline, notably the development of resistance rendering the
agents clinically ineffective and difficulties arising from disturbance of the oral microflora.There is also a need to destroy microorganisms during
dental surgery.The present inventors have developed a method for destroying disease-related microbes in the oral cavity.Accordingly, the present invention provides uses of a photosensitising compound in the manufacture of a medicament
for use in disinfecting or sterilising tissues of the oral cavity or a wound or lesion in the oral cavity as
defined in the claims by:
(a) contacting the tissues, wound or lesion with the photosensitising compound such that any disease-related
microbes in the tissues, wound or lesion take up the photosensitising compound and(b) irradiating the tissues, wound or lesion with laser light at a wavelength absorbed by the photosensitising compound,
wherein the photosensitiser concentration at the site of treatment in from 0.00001 to 0.01% w/v in aqueous solution.The wound or lesion treated may be any surgical or trauma-induced wound, a lesion caused by a disease-related
microbe, or a wound or lesion infected with such a microbe. The treatment may be applied to disinfect or sterilise a
wound or lesion as a routine precaution against infection or as a specific treatment of an already diagnosed infection of
a wound or lesion.Photosensitising compounds for use in accordance with the present invention are generally non-toxic to the target
microbes at concentrations envisaged in accordance with the invention and to the tissues surrounding the wound or
lesion. However there is no particular requirement that the photosensitisers should be non-toxic to the microbes. Moreover,

Use of a photosensitising compound in the manufacture of a
medicament for use in disinfecting or sterilising tissues of the oral cavity or a wound

or lesion in the oral cavity by destruction of disease-related microbes in a periodontal
pocket in order to treat chronic periodontitis by


(a) contacting the tissues, wound or lesion with the photosensitising
compound such that any disease-related microbes in the tissue, wound or lesion take

up the photosensitising compound and
(b) irradiating the tissues, wound or lesion with laser light at a wavelength
absorbed by the photosensitising compound,

wherein the photosensitiser concentration at the site of treatment is from 0.00001 to 0.01% w/v in
aqueous solution.
Use of a photosensitising compound in the manufacture of a
medicament for use in disinfecting or sterilising tissues of the oral cavity or a wound

or lesion in the oral cavity by destruction of disease-related microbes in the region
between the tooth and gingiva in order to treat or prevent inflammatory periodontal

diseases by

(a) contacting the tissues, wound or lesion with the photosensitising
compound such that any disease-related microbes in the tissue, wound or lesion take

up the photosensitising compound and
(b) irradiating the tissues, wound or lesion with laser light at a wavelength
absorbed by the photosensitising compound,

wherein the photosensitiser concentration at the site of treatment is from 0.00001 to 0.01% w/v in aqueous solution. 
Use of a photosensitising compound in the manufacture of a
medicament for use in disinfecting or sterilising tissues of the oral cavity or a wound

or lesion in the oral cavity by disinfection or sterilisation of dental or gingival tissues
in dental surgical procedures by


(a) contacting the tissues, wound or lesion with the photosensitising
compound such that any disease-related microbes in the tissue, wound or lesion take

up the photosensitising compound and
(b) irradiating the tissues, wound or lesion with laser light at a wavelength
absorbed by the photosensitising compound,

wherein the photosensitiser concentration at the site of treatment is from 0.00001 to 0.01% w/v in aqueous solution.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the
photosensitiser is selected from arianor steel blue, toluidine blue O, crystal violet,

methylene blue, azure blue cert, azure B chloride, azure 2, azure A chloride, azure B 
tetrafluoroborate, thionin, azure A eosinate, azure B eosinate, azure mix sicc., azure

II eosinate, haematoporphyrin HCl, haematoporphyrin ester, aluminium
disulphonated phthalocyanine and chlorins.
Use according to any preceding claim wherein the laser light is from a
helium neon gas laser or gallium arsenide laser.
Use according to any preceding claim wherein the laser has a power of
from 1 to 100mW and a beam diameter of from 1 to 10mm.
Use according to any preceding claim wherein the duration of laser
irradiation is from one second to five minutes and the light dose is from 5 to 30

J/cm
2
.
Use according to any preceding claim wherein the photosensitiser is
used in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the photosensitiser in

solution in a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous carrier.
Use according to claim 8 wherein the pharmaceutical composition
further comprises one or more accessory ingredients selected from buffers, salts for

adjusting the tonicity of the solution, antioxidants, preservatives, gelling agents and
remineralisation agents.
