<ABSTRACT>
Electroluminescent devices have, as the active layer, a polymer having a chain comprising a plurality of electroluminescent groupings, adjacent pairs of the electroluminescent groupings being connected via two benzene rings linked by only a single covalent bond, at least one of the benzene rings bearing, at a position ortho to the covalent bond, a substituent of sufficient size that the two benzene rings are essentially not conjugated with each other. Preferred electroluminescent groupings comprise a chain of three or more para-phenylene groups connected to one another by amide, carboxy, ester, urea, urethane or vinyl groups. The polymers have a fixed conjugation length with predictable electroluminescent properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICES COMPRISING POLYMERSThis invention relates to electroluminescent devices containing polymers, and to processes for the use of these devices.In recent years, a great deal of research has been conducted into electro¬ luminescent materials, that is to say materials which emit electromagnetic radiation (typically visible light) when an electric current flows through the polymer. Electro¬ luminescent materials are potentially useful for the construction of image display devices, which could be very thin and lightweight, and could thus advantageously replace cathode ray tubes, gas plasma displays, liquid crystal displays and other types of image display devices. Several different types of electroluminescent materials are known; see, generally as to development of such materials, International Patent Application No. PCT/GB90/00584 (Publication No. WO 90/13148). The first type to be developed was inorganic semiconductor materials such as gallium phosphide and zinc sulfide. However, such inorganic electroluminescent materials are not readily usable in large image display devices, and many of them suffer from practical drawbacks, including poor reliability. Accordingly, most recent research has concentrated on organic electroluminescent materials.Many organic compounds, especially polycyclic arenes such as anthracene, perylene, pyrene and coronene, are electroluminescent. However, electroluminescent devices using these monomeric organic compounds suffer from poor reliability, and these organic compounds present difficulties in preparing the thin layers of the materials needed for use in practical electroluminescent image display devices, and the electrodes needed for electrical contact with such layers. Techniques such as sublimation of the organic material produce layers which are soft, prone to recrystallization and unable to support high temperature deposition of electrode layers, while techniques such as Langmuir-Blodgett film deposition produce films of poor 

quality, dilution of the active material and high cost of fabrication. Prior art electro¬ luminescent devices formed from these materials, such as that described in U.S. Patent No. 3,621,321, typically suffer from high power consumption and low light output.Attempts have also been made to use solid solutions of monomeric organic electroluminescent materials in non-electroluminescent polymers as the active layer in electroluminescent devices; see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,356,429. However, use of such solid solutions
