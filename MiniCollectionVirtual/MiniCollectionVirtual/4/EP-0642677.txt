<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to variable
optical density lenses and in particular to liquid crystal
lenses in which the optical density is varied as a function
of ambient light intensity.One type of liquid crystal spectacle lens with a rapid
response to changes in ambient light is described in US-A-4
279 474 and another is disclosed in our International
patent application, PCT/GB 93/00119, in which we describe
an electrical circuit for controlling the duty cycle of a
waveform for driving a liquid crystal lens in dependence
upon ambient light levels, in order to adjust the amount of
light transmitted through the lens, the circuit including
means for adjusting the response time of the circuit to
changes in ambient light. That invention consists of a
means for varying the rate at which the duty cycle and
hence the optical density changes in response to changes in
ambient light, and, in addition, comprises an arrangement
for setting the threshold at which darkening starts and a
means for obtaining a desired darkening characteristic
above the threshold.However, practical difficulties arise in implementing
the method proposed in US-A 4 279 474 for two interrelated
reasons, namely user comfort and the unavailability of
suitable liquid crystal cells. The operating principle
outlined in US-A-4279474 involves operating the liquid
crystal cell in one of two states, a state of maximum
transmission and a state of minimum transmission. The
average value of the transmission depends on the
proportions of time spent in the two states. It was argued
in US-A-4279474 that provided the switching frequency of
the liquid crystal cell exceeded a certain value, known as
the critical flicker fusion frequency, the wearer would
perceive the average value of transmitted light. The
critical flicker fusion frequency varies with light level
according to the Ferry-Porter law and varies from 
10 to 45 Hz over the range of light levels of interest in
US-A-4 279 474.Human sensitivity to flicker has been studied in
detail (see Lighting and Research Technology 6, (1974) 127,
GW Brundrett). Brundrett reports that the critical flicker
frequency also depends on the amplitude of the flicker
compared to the mean light level. Sensitivity to flicker
above the critical flicker fusion frequency was noted and
led to headaches, dizziness and other side effects. The
sensitivity of humans to flicker, based on
electroretinogram data, has also been measured (see
