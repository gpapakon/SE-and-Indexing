<ABSTRACT>
A transfer system including a contact member (81,82) for applying pressure against a 
copy substrate to create uniform contact between the copy substrate and a developed image 

on an imaging member (10). The transfer system includes a flexible transfer assist blade (82) 
and a rotatable cam (84) shaft having a lobe for deflecting the transfer assist blade into contact 

with the copy substrate. Alternatively, the transfer assist blade may include multiple segments 
and the rotatable cam shaft may include a plurality of lobes, each having a lengthwise 

dimension corresponding to predetermined segments of the blade for providing contact across 
a dimension corresponding to that of the copy substrate. The system further includes a stepper 

motor for rotating the cam to predetermined angular positions to create an abutting 
relationship between the lobe and the transfer assist blade for def
lecting selected segments of 
the blade toward the copy substrate. The transfer assist blade presses the copy sheet into 

contact with at least the developed image on the photoconductive surface to substantially 
eliminate any spaces or gaps between the copy sheet and the developed image during transfer 

of the developed image from the photoconductive surface to the copy sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a system for assisting transfer of a
developed image to a copy substrate in an electrostatographic printing apparatus, and more
particularly concerns an apparatus for enhancing physical contact between the copy substrate
and the developed image situated on a photoreceptive member.Generally, the process of electrostatographic copying is initiated by exposing a light
image of an original document onto a substantially uniformly charged photoreceptive
member Exposing the light image onto the charged photoreceptive member discharges a
photoconductive surface thereon in areas corresponding to non-image areas in the original
document while maintaining the charge in image areas, thereby creating an electrostatic latent
image of the original document on the photoreceptive member. Thereafter, developing
material comprising charged toner particles is deposited onto the photoreceptive member such
that the toner particles are attracted to the charged image areas on the photoconductive
surface to develop the electrostatic latent image into a visible image. This developed image is
then transferred from the photoreceptive member, either directly or after an intermediate
transfer step, to an image support substrate such as a copy sheet, creating an image thereon
corresponding to the original document. The transferred image is typically affixed to the
image support substrate to form a permanent image thereon through a process called
"fusing". In a final step, the photoconductive surface of the photoreceptive member is cleaned
to remove any residual developing material thereon in preparation for successive imaging
cycles.The electrostatographic copying process described above is well known and is
commonly used for light lens copying of an original document. Analogous processes also exist
in other electrostatographic printing applications such as, for example, digital printing where
the latent image is produced by a modulated laser beam, or ionographic printing and
reproduction, where charge is deposited on a charge retentive surface in response to
electronically generated or stored images.The process of transferring charged toner particles from an image bearing member
such as the photoreceptive member to an image support substrate such as the copy sheet is
realized at a transfer station. The transfer process is enabled by overcoming adhesive forces
nolding the toner particles to the image bearing member in a conventional
electrostatographic machine, transfer is achieved by
