<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of signalling, intended for mobile stations belonging to a radio communications system, particularly using:   - an information channel intended to be received by one or more mobile stations, and on which messages called information messages are sent, containing information which is useful for the mobile stations, - a signalling channel on which the mobile stations are continuously active in reception, and on which messages, particularly messages known as signalling messages are sent, characterised in that it consists, before sending of an information message on the information channel, in sending a message, called indication message, on the signalling channel in order to indicate to the mobile stations the type of the next information message which will be sent.

Signalling method for mobile stations belonging to a cellular digital radio communication system using the time-division multiple access principle, said system using in particular:

- an information channel intended to be received by one or more of said mobile stations and on which information messages containing information useful to said mobile stations are transmitted, and
- a signalling channel on which said mobile stations are continuously actively receiving and on which signalling messages in particular are transmitted,

said information channel being constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle, and said signalling channel being constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle so that a time slot of said signalling channel always precedes a time slot of said information channel,

in which method, prior to transmission of an information message on said information channel, an indication message is transmitted on said signalling channel to indicate to said mobile stations the type of the next information message that will be transmitted.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said indication message is contained either in a filler message transmitted on said signalling channel when there is no signalling message to be transmitted to said mobile stations or in a signalling message containing useful information and in which there are available bits, said available bits then containing said indication message.
Method according to either claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that
 said cellular digital radio communication system is a digital cellular system using the time-division multiple access principle, 
in that
 said information channel is constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle, and 
in that
 said signalling channel is constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle so that a time slot of said signalling channel always precedes a time slot of said information channel.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 said signalling channel is a paging channel on which are transmitted to said mobile stations either signalling messages, referred to as paging messages, to advise them that a fixed or mobile user is seeking to contact them, or filler messages.
Method according to either claim 1 or claim 4, 
characterised in that
 it is used to indicate three types of information message:

- information messages of a first type, referred to as ordinary information messages, containing general information addressed to said mobile stations,
- messages of a second type, referred to as urgent messages, containing information to be communicated urgently to said mobile stations, and
- messages of a third type, referred to as filler messages, transmitted when there is no information message of the first or second type to be transmitted.
Method of controlling a mobile station of a cellular digital radio communication system using a method according to any of claims 1 to 5, said system using the time-division multiple access principle, in which control method activation or deactivation of said mobile station receiving on said information channel is commanded according to the type of said information message after an indication message is received advising transmission on said information channel of an information message of a certain type, said information channel being constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle, and said signalling channel being constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle so that a time slot of said signalling channel always precedes a time slot of said information channel.
Method of controlling a mobile station of a cellular digital radio communication system using a method according to claim 5, said system using the time-division multiple access principle, in which control method activation or deactivation, respectively, of said mobile station receiving on said information channel is commanded after receiving an indication message advising the transmission on said information channel of a message of said second or third type, said information channel being constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle, and said signalling channel being constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle so that a time slot of said signalling channel always precedes a time slot of said information channel.
Method according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 said mobile station receiving said information channel is activated after receiving an indication message advising the transmission on said information channel of a message of said first type.
Method according to claim 7 
characterised in that
, after receiving an indication
 message advising transmission on said information channel of a message of said first type also indicating the category of said message of the first type, said mobile station receiving said information channel is activated only if said category corresponds to a previously selected category.
Base station for implementing methods according to any of claims 1 to 9 and belonging to a cellular digital radio communication system using the time division multiple access principle, said system using in particular:

- an information channel intended to be received by one or more mobile stations and on which are transmitted information messages containing information useful to said mobile stations, and
- a signalling channel which said mobile stations continuously actively receive and on which signalling messages in particular are transmitted, the base station in particular includes:
- means for transmitting radio signals, in particular for transmitting in the form of radio signals said information messages on said information channel and said signalling messages on said signalling channel,
- control means for commanding said transmitter means, before transmitting an information message, to transmit in the form of radio signals on said signalling channel an indication message to indicate to said mobile stations the type of the next information message that will be transmitted, and

said information channel being constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle, and said signalling channel being constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle so that a time slot of said signalling channel always precedes a time slot of said information channel.
Mobile station for implementing methods according to any of claims 1 to 9 and belonging to a cellular digital radio communication system using the time-division multiple access principle, said system using in particular:

- an information channel intended to be received by one or more mobile stations and on which are transmitted information messages containing information useful to said mobile stations, and
- a signalling channel on which said mobile stations continuously actively receive and on which signalling messages in particular are transmitted, said mobile station includes:
- means for receiving radio signals,
- means for processing received radio signals, and in particular indication messages advising transmission on said information channel of an information message of a particular type, and
- means for commanding activation or deactivation of said receiver means on said information channel according to the type of said next information message, and

said information channel being constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle, and said signalling channel being constituted by a time slot repeated in accordance with a predetermined cycle so that a time slot of said signalling channel always precedes a time slot of said information channel.
Mobile station according to claim 11, 
characterised in that
 it further includes selection means for the user to select an option for activation of said receiver means according to the indicated information message type.
