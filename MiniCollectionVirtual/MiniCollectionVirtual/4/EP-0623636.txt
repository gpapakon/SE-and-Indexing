<ABSTRACT>
Polycarbonate oligomers having hydroxy end groups 
are produced by a melt reaction with bisphenol-A and a 

basic catalyst. The oligomers may then be reacted with 
chloro end-group siloxanes in the presence of a solvent 

and an acid acceptor to yield polycarbonate-polysiloxane 
block co-polymers. The melt reaction 

occurs at elevated temperature without the direct use 
of phosgene gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
making silicone-polycarbonate block co-polymers. In
particular, the invention relates to a method whereby
polycarbonate oligomers having terminal hydroxy groups
are produced by a melt reaction of polycarbonate resin
with a dihydric phenol in the presence of a catalyst
and in the absence of an organic solvent. The
oligomers are thereafter combined with
polyorganosiloxanes having terminal chloro-organo
siloxy groups to produce the block co-polymers. The
method employed is effective to produce the block co-polymers
without directly using phosgene gas in the
final synthesis.A siloxane polycarbonate resin can be made in a
two-step process involving first reacting chloro end
group siloxane oligomers with an excess of bisphenol-A
(BPA), then reacting the resulting phenolic hydroxy end
group siloxane with additional BPA and phosgene in a
conventional interfacial phosgenation reaction to yield
the desired block co-polymer. One such useful
polycarbonate-polydimethylsiloxane block co-polymer
contains 43 weight percent siloxane units with an
average block length of about 10. The material has
utility as an impact modifier in blends with
polycarbonate resin and as a film used as an interlayer
in multilayer laminates of polycarbonate resin sheets
and acrylic resin sheets. Typically, these laminates
consist of two or more layers of polycarbonate sheet,
optionally with an internal layer of acrylic sheet,
with the resin interlayers serving as an adhesive and
as a spacer to separate the sheets. .In a particular process set forth in Vaughn, U.S.
Patent No. 3,189,662, assigned to the Assignee herein
and incorporated herein by reference, silicone-polycarbonate
block co-polymers are made by
phosgenating a mixture of dihydric phenol terminated
polydiorganosiloxane and dihydric phenol in the
presence of an organic solvent and an acid acceptor.
Although the method results in the production of
silicone-polycarbonate block copolymers useful in a
variety of applications, such as injection moldable
thermoplastics and elastomers having improved tensile
properties, the method requires the direct use of
phosgene gas in the final synthesis.Silicone-poly(arylcarbonate) block co-polymers can
be made without directly using phosgene gas in the
final synthesis of the block co-polymer as set forth in
Evans, U.S. Patent No. 4,920,183, assigned to the
Assignee herein. A hydroxyaryl terminated
poly(arylcarbonate) oligomer having an average of about
2 to about 1,000 chemically combined arylcarbonate
