<ABSTRACT>
A wire (10,102) for use in combination with a 
microcatheter to form an occlusion within a vascular 

cavity, the wire comprising: 

a core wire (10); and 
a detachable elongate tip portion (102) coupled to a 
distal portion of the core wire, the tip portion extending 

the core wire for a predetermined lineal extent and being 
adapted to be positioned, in use, in a vascular cavity to 

form an occlusion in the vascular cavity, whereby 
endovascular occlusion of the vascular cavity can be 

performed;
 

   characterised in that the detachable elongate tip 
portion (102) has a plurality of filaments or fine hairs 

extending therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a wire for use in
combination with a microcatheter to form an occlusion
within a vascular novelty.Approximately 25,000 intracranial aneurysms rupture
every year in North America. The primary purpose of
treatment for ruptured intracranial aneurysm is to prevent
rebleeding. At the present time, three general methods of
treatment exist, namely an extravascular, endovascular and
extra-endovascular approach.The extravascular approach is comprised of surgery
or microsurgery of the aneurysm or treatment site for the
purpose of preserving the parent artery. This treatment
is common with intracranial berry aneurysms. The
methodology comprises the step of clipping the neck of
the aneurysm, performing a suture-ligation of the neck,
or wrapping the entire aneurysm. Each of these surgical
procedures is performed by intrusive invasion into the
body and performed from outside the aneurysm or target
site. General anaesthesia, craniotomy, brain retraction
and arachnoid dissection around the neck of the
aneurysm and placement of a clip are 
typically required in these surgical procedures. Surgical treatment of vascular
intracranial aneurysm can expect a mortality rate of 4-8% with a morbidity rate of 18-20%.
Because of the mortality and morbidity rate expected, the surgical procedure is
often delayed while waiting for the best surgical time with the result that an
additional percentage of patients will die from the underlying disease or defect prior
to surgery. For this reason the prior art has sought alternative means of treatment.In the endovascular approach, the interior of the aneurysm is entered through
the use of a microcatheter. Recently developed microcatheters, such as those shown
by Engelson, "Catheter Guidewire", U.S. Patent 4,884,579 and as described in
Engelson, "Catheter for Guidewire Tracking", U.S. Patent 4,739,768 (1988), allow
navigation into the cerebral arteries and entry into a cranial aneurysm.In such procedures a balloon is typically attached to the end of the
microcatheter and it is possible to introduce the balloon into the aneurysm, inflate it,
and detach it, leaving it to occlude the sac and neck with preservation of the parent
artery. While endovascular balloon embolization of berry aneurysms is an attractive
method in situations where an extravascular surgical approach is difficult, inflation of
a balloon into the aneurysm carries some risk of aneurysm rupture due to possible
over-distention of portions of the sac and due to the traction produced while
detaching the
