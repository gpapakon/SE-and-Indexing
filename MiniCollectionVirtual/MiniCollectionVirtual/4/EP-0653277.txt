<ABSTRACT>
A centrifugal drier for abrasive and impact sensitive synthetic granules has a vertical rotor (2) inside a sieve basket (3) with an inlet (14) for the product at the bottom and an outlet (15) at the top. Near the outlet the rotor has discharge blades (21) and an adjustable fan (19). Near the rotor blades (7) the rotor (2) has perforations (27) through which a suction fan (52) draws drying air in contra flow through the granules. The rotor is driven at reduced speed and the suction fan (52) gives a relative speed of 10-40 m/sc between the drying air and the granules.

Granulate drier for abrasive and impact-sensitive synthetic material granulates,
consisting of a rotor (2) which is vertically arranged in a housing (1) and surrounded by a

sieve basket (3) and which is provided for the conveying of the moist synthetic material
granulate (14'), which is fed into a lower product inlet (14), to an upwardly arranged

product outlet (15) by conveying scoops (7) arranged one above the other and
distributed over the rotor circumference, wherein a ventilator (19) provided with thrower

scoops (21) and adjustable air slots (22) is arranged in the region of the product outlet
(15), characterised thereby that bores (27) are provided at the circumference of the rotor

(2) in the region of the conveying scoops (7) and a suction ventilator (52) with a suction
connection (5) for sucking away drying air, which is guided in counterflow to the

granulate (14'), after the moistening thereof is connected in the proximity of the base of
the drier, wherein the rotor (2) at reduced rotational speed and the suction ventilator (25)

are operable in such a manner that a relative speed of the granulate (14') to the drying
air of between 10 to 40 metres per second sets in in the drier.
Granulate drier according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the suction
connection (5) of the suction ventilator (52) is arranged opposite the product inlet (14),

wherein the sieve basket (3) is formed as a closed region (31) in the vicinity of the
suction connection (5).
Granulate drier according to claims 1 and 2, characterised thereby that the suction
ventilator (52) is operable with an overall pressure difference of up to 200 millimetres

Ws.
