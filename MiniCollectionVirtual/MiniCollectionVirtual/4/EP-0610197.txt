<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a tire wherein at least one of the tread, steel-cord skim stock, sidewall and carcass portions contains a rubber composition formed by curing a blend of a. natural rubber, polyisoprene or a mixture thereof, b. butadiene rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber or a mixture thereof, c. carbon black, d. activator, e. zinc oxide, f. sulfur or a sulfur donor, and g. curing accelerator, characterized in that said rubber composition has a heat buildup of 20-35  DEG C. These tires exhibit one or more improvements in a wide variety of properties. The present invention relates also to a belt which contains such a rubber composition, characterized in that said rubber composition has a heat buildup of 10-25  DEG C. These belts exhibit also one or more improvements in a variety of properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Tire and Belt CompositionsThe present invention relates to tires and belts which have improved properties as compared to standard tire and belt compositions. The inventors have found that tire and belt compositions having a reduced heat buildup exhibit improved properties, especially when subjected to environments which lead to ageing of the rubber compositions.The importance of heat buildup is recognized in the article, "Carbon Black in NR/BR Blends for Truck Tires," Rubber Chemistry and Technology, Vol. 58, pp. 350-368 (1985), wherein it is stated that treadwear, heat buildup, resistance to cutting and chipping and fuel economy are important to heavy duty truck tire performance.Accordingly, there is a need in the art for tire and belt products which exhibit a low heat buildup, since such products exhibit a better performance as well as having, in many cases, a longer service life.Many attempts have been made to produce products with a low heat buildup. For example, European Patent application 0314271 discloses the use of an improved processing aid to improve handling, durability and rolling resistance of tires, as well as reducing heat buildup.European Patent application 0451 603 relates to the use of an anionic polymerization initiator for curing elastomers to improve their hysteresis. Improved hysteresis leads to tires having a lower rolling resistance. One aspect of hysteresis is heat buildup.PCT patent application WO 91/05821 discloses a tire sidewall composition comprising a particular polymer which leads to sidewalls having a desirable reduced internal heat buildup and improved adhesion to adjacent rubber carcass and tread portions of the tire. 

 Finally, the publication, "Natural Rubber Compounds for Truck Tires," NR Technology, Vol. 16, Part 1 (1985) suggests the use of additional stearic acid activator in order to reduce the heat generation, among other properties, in truck tires.However, all of these solutions fall short of the goal of providing tires and belts with longer service life, better ageing characteristics, lower rolling resistance and better fuel economy. The present inventors have surprisingly found that tire and belt compositions having a particular heat buildup exhibit several improved properties, particularly when the tires and belts are subjected to service conditions.More specifically, the present invention relates, in one aspect to a tire wherein at least one of the tread, steel-cord skim stock, sidewall and carcass portions contains a rubber composition formed by curing
