<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compound having 
an anti-psychotic activity and little extrapyramidal side 
effect, and to an anti-psychotic agent comprising at least 
one of the compound and a pharmacologically acceptable salt 
thereof as an active ingredient. There have hitherto been used chlorpromazine, 
haloperidol and the like as anti-psychotic agents, which 
involve central side effects such as extrapyramidal 
effects, for example parkinsonism. The other side effects 
thus causing clinically serious problems. In these years, there have been proposed the 
compounds of the following formula (I), wherein W 
represents an imide derivative, such as tiospiron or SM-9018 
as the compounds with which the aforementioned 
problems were to be solved (e.g. in EP 464846, Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 235865/1990, US 4968792, 
US 4956368, WO 9002552, EP 329168, EP 314098, Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 10786/1988 and 
83067/1988, and DE 3247530). There are also known the compounds represented by 
the following general fourmula (I) in which W represents - 
O-R and R represents a phenyl derivative (Japanese Patent 
Application No. 63263/1990), or an imide or amide 
derivative (Japanese Patent Application No. 4771/1990). 
Furthermore, there are similarly known the compounds 
wherein W represents a group having an amide skeleton such 
as those described in EP 329168, US 4933453 or EP 316723, 
or W represents an aromatic ring or a heteroaromatic ring 
which is directly bonded to the main structure without 
intervening a hetero atom such as described in EP 409435, 
EP 378255, EP 378255, EP 353821, US 4831031 and EP 281309. Although the above compounds have been reported  
 
that the side effects have successfully been reduced, the 
ratio of a dose for exhibiting anti-psychotic activity to 
a dose for exhibiting extrapyramidal side effects such as 
catalepsy causing action remains relatively small. Thus it 
has been desired to dissociate sufficiently the difference 
between the effective dose and the side effect causing 
dose. The present inventors have now found that a certain 
compound has a strong anti-psychotic activity and little 
extrapyramidal side effect, and thus accomplished the 
present invention. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a compound which has an anti-psychotic activity and 
little extrapyramidal side effect. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide an anti-psychotic agent comprising the above 
derivative. The compound according
