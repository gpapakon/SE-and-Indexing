<ABSTRACT>
A circuit breaker equipped with a compatible remote control unit (11) includes a mechanical transmission link (74) independent of the main mechanism, for transmitting the position of the moving contact (16) to an indicator (34), which automatically unlocks a lock (38) in open position in order to allow a slider (64) to be padlocked. The mechanical link (74) is in two parts, consisting of a pusher (46) connected to a control lever (37) on which the indicator (34) is arranged, and a link rod (56) articulated on to the switching bar (18).

<CLAIMS>
A remote controlled circuit breaker (10) comprising a remote control unit (11) able 
to be fitted to a multipole circuit breaker (12) having an insulating case (13) housing in 

each pole a system of separable contacts (14, 16, 22, 24) actuated by a switching bar 
(18) between a closed position and an open position and vice-versa, said remote 

control unit comprising : 

a mechanism (26) equipped with a gearing-down device (28) and operating means 
(BPF, BPO, 30) enabling rotation of the insulating bar (18) between the closed and 

open positions, 
display means (34) for local display of the open or closed state of the contact 
system (14), 
and locking means (38, 70) for locking the contact system in the open position 
providing a visible break disconnection function of the circuit breaker (10), 
 
characterized in that
 
the display means (34) are arranged on an operating lever (36) linked to the bar (18) 

by an independent mechanical transmission link (74), made up of two parts 
comprising a push-rod (46) engaged inside the remote control unit (11) with a 

transmission finger (42) of the operating lever (36), and comprising a position sensor 
(54) coming into abutment with a link rod (56) located in the case (13) of the circuit 

breaker unit (12) and articulated on the bar (18), that the locking means comprise a 
locking bolt (38) equipped with a slide rack (64), and that the operating lever (36) is 

equipped with a latching element (43) able to cooperate with a retaining element of 
the slide rack (64) to lock or unlock the latter depending on whether the contacts (14, 

16, 22, 24) are in the open or closed state, the slide rack (64) being extractable when 
the contact system (14) is in the open position, the locking means (38, 70) in the 

extracted state of the slide rack (64) performing locking of the contact system (14) in 
the open position. 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
extractable rack (64) is equipped with an orifice (66) for fitting the padlocking device 

(70) in the unlocked state of the rack (64).  
 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the push-rod (46) comprises, opposite from the sensor (54), an opening (44) housing 

the transmission finger (42), imposing alternate pivoting of the lever (36) around a 
spindle (37) when translation movement of the push-rod (46) occurs, movement of 

the lever (36) to the open state of the display means (34) bringing about automatic 
unlocking of the latching and retaining parts (43, 41). 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the display means (34) comprise an indicator arranged opposite the finger (42) with 

respect to the spindle (37) of the operating lever (36), and that the latching element 
(43) is located between the spindle (37) and indicator (34). 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the push-rod (46) is guided in translation by guiding means (48, 

50) between a first position and a second end-of-travel position corresponding 
respectively to the closed and open state of the contacts, and that a return spring 

(52) urges the push-rod (46) to the second position. 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the end of the link rod (56) cooperating with the sensor (54) of the push-rod (46) is 

guided in translation by a slide (62) located in the upper part of the case (13). 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the slide(62) is arranged in a spacer separating two adjacent poles. 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the articulation point (58) of the link rod (56) is eccentric with respect to the axis 

(60) of the switching bar (18), and that the push-rod (46) is in alignment with the link 
rod (56) in to a direction perpendicular to the front panel (32).
