<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst for obtaining pyromellitic anhydride 
having high purity at a high raw material gas concentration 

with high yield and a method for the production of 

pyromellitic anhydride are provided. The catalyst containing 
vanadium and silver so essential component elements for 

catalyst and having an atomic ratio of silver to vanadium in 
the range of from 0.001 to 0.2 allows efficient production of 

pyromellitic anhydride by the vapor-phase oxidation of a 
tetraalkylbenzene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas. The 

method of this invention accomplishes the production of 
pyromellitic anhydride by the use of the catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst for the
production of pyromellitic anhydride and a method for the
production of pyromellitic anhydride. More particularly, it
relates to a catalyst to be used in the production of
pyromellitic anhydride by the catalytic vapor-phase oxidation
of a tetraalkylbenzene and a method for the production of
pyromellitic anhydride from a tetraalkylbenzene by the use of
the catalyst. The pyromellitic anhydride is extensively used
as heat-resistant resins, plasticizers, epoxy resin-curing
agents, etc. As an industrial raw material, it has been
acquiring an increasingly great importance in recent years.Besides the method of catalytic vapor-phase oxidation
of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (occasionally referred to
briefly as "durene"), a method which resorts to the liquid-phase
oxidation of durene, a method which relies on the
liquid-phase oxidation of 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde, and
methods which reside in the synthesis of starting materials
other than durene have been proposed for the production of
pyromellitic anhydride. Among other methods cited above, the
method of vapor-phase oxidation of durene has been
particularly attracting attention as a process allowing
inexpensive quantity production of pyromellitic anhydride
because the raw material, durene, which has been heretofore
expensive now promises to be inexpensively supplied in large
quantities owing to the use of a zeolite type catalyst.Numerous inventions covering catalysts for the
catalytic vapor-phase oxidation of durene have been disclosed
in patent literature. For example, a V2O5-P2O5-TiO2, MoO3,
WO3 type catalyst (JP-B-45-4,978), a V2O5-TiO2 (anatase type)-MoO3,
P2O5 type catalyst (JP-B-45-15,018), a V2O5-TiO2-Na2O,
P2O5 type catalyst (JP-B-45-15,252), a V2O5-MoO3-P2O5 type
catalyst (JP-B-47-38,431), a V2O5-P2O5-MoO3-TiO2 type catalyst 
(JP-B-49-30,821), a V2O5-TiO2-P2O5-Nb2O5-K2O, CsO type
catalyst (JP-A-49-31,972), a V2O5-B2O3-SnO2, P2O5, TiO2, Na2O
type catalyst (JP-B-49-31,973), a V2O5-B2O5 type catalyst (JP-B-48-35,251),
and a V2O5-Na2O-MoO3-Cr, Mn, Nb type catalyst
(US-A-4,925,957 and US-A-5,001,100) have been disclosed.The catalysts of these conventional compositions,
however, hardly deserve to be called satisfactory from the
commercial point of view because the concentration of a
tetraalkylbenzene in the raw material gas composition is as
low as less than 20 g/Nm3 and the pyromellitic acid aimed at
is obtained only in an unduly low yield when this
concentration is increased beyond 20 g/Nm3. None of the known
