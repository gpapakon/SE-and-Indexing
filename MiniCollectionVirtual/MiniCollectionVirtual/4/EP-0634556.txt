<ABSTRACT>
The window sash frame comprises two first (vertical) wooden frame members and two second (horizontal) wooden frame members (1, 2) which are connected to one another at the four corners of the frame by mortice and tenon connections (3 - 8) provided at their ends. The second wooden frame members (2) exhibit in the region of their overhang parts, at their ends, in each case one supporting tongue (9) which extends, in the plane of the frame, over the entire width (B) of the overhang part and projects approximately 3 - 6 mm beyond the base of the mortice (7) located there. In the region of their overhang parts, on their inner sides (1c) directed towards the glazing bars, supporting grooves (11) are provided on the first wooden frame members (1) for the purpose of engagement with the supporting tongues (9). The supporting grooves (11) are provided only in the region of the mortices (4) and tenons (3), the length (L) of each supporting groove (11) from the associated end side (1d) of the wooden frame member (1) corresponding only to the width (B) of the overhang part (1b) and the length of the supporting tongue (9) or being only slightly longer than the same.
