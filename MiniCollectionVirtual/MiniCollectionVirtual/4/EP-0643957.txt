<ABSTRACT>
A dental product is provided in a dual-compartment dispenser that includes a 
first and second composition in respective compartments thereof. The first 

composition includes a zinc salt while the second composition includes a 
bicarbonate salt. Preferably the first composition also contains a peroxygen 

compound or a C-C carboxylic acid. The zinc salt in combination with the 
bicarbonate salt achieves an enhanced antitartar effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a dental composition and method for controlling tartar
formation on teeth.Baking soda, chemically known as sodium bicarbonate, has become a popular
ingredient in dental compositions. A considerable body of literature describes
sodium bicarbonate dentifrices. These include U.S. Patent 3,935,305, U.S.
Patent 3,937,803, U.S. Patent 3,937,321, U.S. Patent 3,937,804, U.S.
Patent 3,943,240 and U.S. Patent 4,160,022, all to Delaney et al assigned
to the Colgate-Palmolive Company.Further patents in this area include U.S. Patent 4,547,362, U.S.
Patent 4,623,536 and U.S. Patent 4,943,429, all to Winston et al, assigned
to the Church & Dwight Company, which markets Arm & Hammer brand
toothpaste.Sodium bicarbonate toothpastes such as the Arm & Hammer brand have
become commercially successful because of association of the featured
ingredient with malodor reduction and antibacterial activity. Whether these
perceived effects are real is subject to debate. However, there is evidence to
suggest that baking soda does not have antitartar activity. Oral compositions containing both sodium bicarbonate and a peroxide have
been acclaimed by the dental profession, especially through the work of
Keyes. See Keyes et al. "Periodontics and Oral Hygiene", January 1978,
pages 51-56.There is a storage stability problem in formulating the products containing the
two key elements of the Keyes technology. Decomposition occurs unless
unusual measures are taken to separate the components. A quite successful
approach to the problem has involved physical segregation of the peroxide
into a compartment separate from the bicarbonate. U.S. Patent 4,849,213,
U.S. Patent 4,687,663 and U.S. Patent 4,528,180, all to Schaef- fer,
disclose a package with a dual-compartment respectively storing a peroxide
gel and a bicarbonate paste. A successful commercial product known as
Mentadent has utilized the dual-compartment package concept to provide
consumers with a storage stable product. Technology utilized in this product
is reported in U.S. Patent 5,037,633 and U.S. Patent 5,037,634, both to
Williams et al. While this product has been found to have a modest level of
antitartar activity, there remains room for significant improvement.Zinc compounds, especially zinc citrate, have a long history of use as antitartar
actives. In the United States, zinc citrate has been formulated into the
Close-Up and Aim brand products by Chesebrough-Pond's. Typical of the
zinc antiplaque and antitartar technology is that described in U.S. Patent
