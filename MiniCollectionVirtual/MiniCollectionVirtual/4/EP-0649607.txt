<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the provision in a 
cigarette filter element (1) of a capsule (2) containing a 

deodoriser. The capsule is resistant to the handling 
endured before and during smoking, yet ruptures to release 

or expose the deodoriser upon extinguishing of the smoked 
cigarette. The deodoriser may comprise neutralising or 

masking agents, or mixtures of both.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tobacco-smoke filter
elements of smoking articles.It is well known that after smoking articles have
been smoked, the odour therefrom, in the absence of fresh
air, remains in a room or ashtray for a considerable time.
In enclosed spaces such as these the after-effects of
smoking leave lingering stale odour which can be found
to be unpleasant by smokers and non-smokers.This invention has as an object to overcome the
odorous after-effects, of smoking, particularly in enclosed
spaces.Various means of encapsulating liquid substances for
release in tobacco-smoke filter elements have been
proposed. For example, the Applicant has previously
described in U.K. Patent Specification No. 1 234 802 the
packaging of liquid substances in a hollow, preferably
flexible, tube. The tube is filled with the substance in
liquid form, then subjected to cooling to freeze the
liquid substance, cut to lengths and then end-sealed by
dipping into a solidifiable sealing medium or by
application of end caps, for example.U.K. 1 257 290 describes the use of such filled
flexible tubes in a three-component filter element, a
central section comprising the sealed capsule between two
end sections. The filled flexible tubes are subjected to
digital pressure before smoking occurs, whereby the 
friable end-sealant ruptures to release the encapsulated liquid
and the released liquid may enhance the filtration efficiency of
the filter element or otherwise affect the smoke flavour
characteristics of the smoking article during smoking.U.K. 1 267 272 discloses a method of producing wax coated
capsules containing a liquid material such as water, which might
also be useful in filter elements where increased filtration
efficiency or flavour enhancement during smoking is desired.LU 52495 teaches of a smoke filter element which introduces
a smoke treating liquid into the path of smoke drawn through the
filter element. The filter comprises the smoke treating liquid
contained in one or more frangible capsules and a multiplicity
of activated carbon particles. The capsules are broken by
squeezing the filter element. The smoke treating liquid thereby
released is absorbed by the filtration material and the
activated carbon particles. The filter element is therefore
prevented from becoming soggy whilst maintaining the liquid
available to treat smoke passing through the filter element
during smoking. The smoke treating liquid may comprise water,
and additionally a flavour may be added to flavour the tobacco
smoke.U.S. 3,297,038 teaches

<CLAIMS>
A smoking article filter element comprised of filtration
material and a capsule containing a deodoriser capable of

reducing the smoke odour of the filter element after
smoking of a smoking article incorporating said filter

element has occurred, the capsule being resistant to the
manual handling encountered during removal of said article

from a packet and ignition of said article and being
susceptible to breakage to expose said deodoriser within

said filter element upon the extinguishing of the smoked
said article, said capsule being comprised of any one of

the group consisting of glass tubing, thin-walled aluminium
tubing or hollow pasta, Plaster of Paris, an inorganic

insoluble agent, a synthetic gum, a varnish, extruded
hollow tubing of reconstituted tobacco material, a thread

of material or a brittle material treated with deodoriser
and coated with a coating, or being a flexible material

which can sustain bending but which has a wall which is
piercable by a piercing device located alongside the

capsule.
