<ABSTRACT>
An insertion tube (11) for a vaginal cup (1) may be produced with a simple design and 
be easy to use. The insertion tube is formed by an outer tube (13) placed slidable on 

an inner tube (12) having at one of its ends two swingable jaws (14, 15) formed 
between two incisions (16, 17). The outer tube (13) may be moved up over the jaws 

(14, 15) when the vaginal cup (1) is placed in said jaws in a folded condition. Thus, 
the vaginal cup may in a very simple manner be inserted in the vagina in its folded 

condition. After insertion the outer tube (13) is moved away from the jaws which will 
open and permit the vaginal cup (1) to expand elastically and fit tigthly to the vaginal 

wall. Subsequently the insertion tube (11) is withdrawn completely.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an insertion tube for a vaginal cup for retaining 
menstrual liquids and comprising an elastic, flexible, substantially cylindrical, cup-shaped 
container with a mouth which is intended to turn upwards in the vagina. Vaginal cups for retaining menstrual liquids have been known since the 30's. Attempts 
to market vaginal cups in Denmark were made in the early 70's but they were never 
very successful despite the advantages associated with the vaginal cup compared to the 
use of tampons or towels. The vaginal cup only has to be changed once or twice every 
24 hours. Furthermore, when placed correctly a vaginal cup will not give rise to 
embarrassing smells as no oxygen will get in contact with the menstrual liquid. As the 
vaginal cup itself is well known, it will not be described in further detail. A tool for inserting vaginal cups has previously been disclosed. Thus, a tool similar 
to forceps is known from U.S. patent No. 3 404 682 which has made it possible to 
hold the cup in a folded and partially compressed condition until inserted in the 
vagina. However, this tool is relatively complicated and has never become widespread 
for vaginal cups used for menstrual protection. The tool is relatively voluminous and 
it has been difficult for women to become familiar with using the tool. In US-A-2 351 836 an insertion tube according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed. It is the object of the present invention to disclose an insertion tube which is of a 
simple design and easy to use. This is achieved by the present invention 
as defined in claim 1. When using a tubular insertion tube, the vaginal cup may in principle be inserted in 
a manner analogous to the insertion of a tampon with the exception, however, that a 
vaginal cup is not to be inserted as far as a tampon.  
 The slidable outer tube only has to have a diameter so that it fits on the outside of the 
inner tube. In a very simple punching operation, the inner tube, which is preferably 
manufactured from cardboard, may be provided with incisions extending from one end 
of the tube so that between the incisions jaws are formed which are connected to the 
remaining part of the inner tube in such a manner that they may be turned or swung 
in order to hold a vaginal cup folded or compressed during insertion. In a simple 
manner the two jaws are held together by sliding the outer tube forward over the jaws. The vaginal cup is easily placed in the inner tube when the jaws are moved away from 
each other. The vaginal

<CLAIMS>
An insertion tube (11) for a vaginal cup (4) for retaining menstrual liquids and comprising 
an elastic, flexible, substantially cylindrical, cup-shaped container with a mouth which 

is intended to turn upwards in the vagina said insertion tube 
comprising an outer tube (13) and two jaws (14, 15), which are capable of 

being moved away from each other and in which said container (4) 
is placed in a folded state during insertion, 
characterized
 in that 
said insertion tube further comprises an inner tube (12) having at one of its ends said jaws (14, 15), 

which are formed by providing two incisions (16, 17) opposite each other which extend 
at least in the longitudinal direction of said inner tube (12) and that said inner tube (12) 

is placed slidably in said outer tube (13) in order to hold said jaws (14, 15) together during insertion. 
An insertion tube according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that said two 
incisions (16, 17) are substantially V-shaped with a tapering away from said one end of said inner 

tube (12), that either incision (16, 17) has a part adjacent its bottom and extending in the 
circumferential direction of said inner tube, and that at the bottom of the V said 

incisions have an extension extending in the circumferential direction. 
An insertion tube according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that one incision (16) 
is considerably larger than the other incision (17). 
An insertion tube according to any one of claims 2 to 3, 
characterized
 
in that said two incisions have, in the longitudinal direction of the tube, an extension 

corresponding substantially to the length of the container. 
An insertion tube according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that said 
two incisions (16, 17) are formed under a mutual angle
 of less than 180° 
towards the longitudinal axis of the inner tube, that said two jaws (14, 15) are formed coherently 

between said two incisions (16, 17) at the side where said angle is greater than 180° 
towards the longitudinal axis of the inner tube, and that on the other side of said  

 
incisions (16, 17) a cylindrical surface is provided which is insertable between said two jaws 

(14, 15) as it is provided with lines of weakening for forming folding lines in order to form a 
sharp ridge when folding the vaginal cup between the jaws. 
An insertion tube according to claim 5, 
characterized
 in that said inner 
tube (12) is formed from one item consisting of two shell halves (34, 35) connected to each other 

by a hinge connection (36) at the end of said inner tube (12) which is distant from said jaws (14, 15). 
An insertion tube according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 
in that said insertion tube has a length between 100 and 150 mm, preferably between 

115 and 125 mm, and an inside diameter between 19 and 27 mm, preferably between 
20 and 22 mm, and that said inner tube (12) has an inside diameter between 18 and 26 mm, 

preferably between 19 and 21 mm for a cup with an unfolded diameter between 38 and 
42 mm. 
An insertion tube according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 
in that it is manufactured from cardboard. 
An insertion tube according to any one of claims 1-7,
