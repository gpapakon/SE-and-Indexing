<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention there are provided 
method and apparatus for producing a simple printing 

plate having open cells, which method and apparatus 
area simple in construction and permit accurate and 

continuous production of the printing plate. 
 
More specifically, as the method there is provided 
a method of producing a simple printing plate having 

open cells by pressing both an embossing member having a 
relief image (T) and a to-be-embossed member (W) which is a 

sheet having open cells, in a heated state of the 
embossing member, allowing the relief image to be 

transferred to the to-be-embossed member, characterized 
in that the embossing member is attached to an embossing 

cylinder (3), the to-be-embossed member is attached to a to-be-embossed 
cylinder (2), one or both of the embossing 

cylinder and the to-be-embossed cylinder being in an 
arcuate form, and both cylinders are rotated in 

synchronism with each other, thereby pressing the 
embossing member and the to-be-embossed member in a 

rolling fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for producing a simple printing plate, 
especially an ink-soaked printing plate for use as a 
stamp, a seal, or the like. Particularly, the invention 
is concerned with a method and apparatus for producing a 
simple printing plate or an ink-soaked printing plate, 
using means for bringing a to-be-embossed member which 
is a sheet having open cells into pressure contact under 
heating with an embossing member having an intaglio 
plate as a female die to transfer a desired relief image 
onto the sheet. Printing plates are being improved day by day, and 
now resinous relief printing plates, planographic 
printing plates and intaglio printing plates, which are 
formed using photosensitive resins, are most popular as 
substitute for the conventional metallic printing 
plates. On the other hand, such simple printing system 
as copying machines and ink-soaked printing plates are 
being utilized not only for office works in companies 
but also even in homes at large.  
 Under the circumstances, it is required to provide 
a system which permits easy fabrication of a printing 
plate without requiring skill or the use of a large-sclae 
equipment. As one of printing plates which meet 
such requirement, an ink-soaked printing plate is 
becoming more and more popular. The ink-soaked printing plate is a printing plate 
having a relief image on the surface of a porous 
material, and by holding ink in the porous material it 
is made possible to effect continuous printing without 
replenishing ink at every printing. The ink-soaked 
printing plate is used mainly as a seal or stamp. As 
the porous material there is usually employed a 
thermoplastic resin or rubber. As a method for producing such an ink-soaked 
printing plate there is disclosed in JP 53-136080A a 
method wherein a thermoplastic resin powder having fine 
open cells therein is charged into a female die having a 
concave portion, followed by hot pressing, to obtain a 
printing plate for use as an ink-soaked printing plate. 
In JP 62-16188B there is disclosed a method wherein a 
masking member having an image is brought into close 
contact with a material for an ink-soaked printing plate 
such as rubber or a soft synthetic resin, followed by 
radiation of a laser beam through the masking member to  
 
remove the unmasked surface-layer portion, thereby 
affording a printing plate for use as an ink-soaked 
printing plate. In JP 55-90361A is disclosed a method 
wherein a pasty material comprising a

A method of producing a simple printing plate 
having open cells by pressing both an embossing member 

having a relief image and a to-be-embossed member formed 
in the shape of a sheet having open cells, in a heated 

state of the embossing member, to transfer the relief 
image to the to-be-embossed member, the method 

comprising the steps of attaching said embossing member to an 
embossing cylinder, attaching said to-be-embossed member 

to a to-be-embossed cylinder, 
and rotating both said cylinders in synchronism 

with each other to press both said embossing member and 
said to-be-embossed member in a rolling fashion. 
The process of claim 1, wherein said sheet having 
open cells is a foam sheet. 
The process of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said 
pressing in a rolling fashion is performed at a pressure 

of 0.05 to 50 kgf/cm
2
(4.9 to 4,900 kPa). 
The process of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said 
pressing in a rolling fashion is performed using an 

elastic member through which said embossing cylinder 
and said to-be-embossed cylinder are interconnected, 

said elastic member having a stroke which permits the 
elastic member to follow changes in the thickness of 

said embossing member.  
 
The process of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein said 
embossing member having a relief image has been formed 

reliefwise from a photosensitive resin composition. 
The process of any of claims 1 to 5, wehrein both 
said embossing cylinder and said to-be-embossed cylinder 

are arcuate.

plate having open cells by pressing both an embossing 

member having a relief image and a to-be-embossed member 
formed in the shape of a sheet having open cells, in a 

heated state of the embossing member, to transfer the 
relief image to the to-be-embossed member, the 

apparatus including: 

an embossing cylinder for holding said embossing 
member over an arcuate surface; 
a to-be-embossed cylinder for holding said to-be-embossed 
member over an arcuate surface; and 
a drive means for rotating both said embossing 
cylinder and said to-be-embossed cylinder in synchronism 

with each other.
