<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed therein is a dynamic memory device having an 
internal power source circuit generating an internal power 

voltage which is smaller than an external power voltage 
applied to the device and supplied to an internal memory 

circuit as an operating voltage. The internal power source 
circuit includes a differential amplifier for stabilizing 

the internal power voltage in response to a reference 
voltage, and a current flowing through the differential 

amplifier is controlled to a first value during a standby 
mode, a second value larger than the first value during a 

data sensing operation and restoring (refreshing) operation 
of an active mode, and a third value larger than the first 

value but smaller than the second value during the other 
operation of the active mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory
device and, more particularly, to a dynamic random access
memory device having an internal power source which steps
down or reduces the level of a power supply voltage applied
to the memory from an outside (i.e., an external power
supply voltage) and produces and supplies an internal power
voltage to an internal circuit of the memory device as an
operating power voltage.From US-A-4 925 863, a semiconductor memory device is known
which suggests to add a high power control transistor to a
voltage regulator circuit.IEEE Journal of SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, vol.27, no.6,
June 1992, New York, USA, pages 920-926 discloses
a voltage down converter with submicroampere standby
current for low-power static RAMs.It is well known in the art that latest dynamic memory
devices constituted of MOS transistors employ a technique in
which an internal power source circuit is used to reduce an
external power supply voltage and supply an internal power
voltage having a stepped-down voltage level to an internal
memory circuit as an operating power voltage for the
prevention of gate oxide film rupture and the occurrence of
hot carriers and also for the reduction of power
dissipation. Although this technique is very useful for
fine pattern MOS transistors as well as in view of
suppression of power consumption, the internal power voltage
thus produced is required to be stabilized against the
change in impedance of the internal memory circuit. For 
this purpose, the internal power source circuit utilizes a
differential amplifier circuit which compares the internal
power voltage with a reference voltage to stabilize the
internal power voltage. That is, the internal power source
performs a linear operation and thus consumes a d.c. power
irrespective no access to the memory.As is also well known in the art, the memory device has
not only an active operation mode in which a data read and
write access operations are performed, but also a standby
mode waiting for the data read/write access. The power
consumed by the memory device, in particular the power
dissipation in the standby mode, is desirable to be as small
as possible. This desire is very strong in a battery-operated
apparatus or system.However, the internal power source circuit always
consumes a power, as mentioned above. In the active
operation mode, the power consumed by the internal power
source circuit is very small as compared to that consumed by
the internal memory circuit responsive to an access request.
