<ABSTRACT>
Gluing machine especially for lining (coating) sheets of paper with reinforcing card, comprising a movable bridge (1) for supporting a stack (2) of sheets, electronic means for controlling the drive (movement) of the bridge (1), a support head (6) for suction-pad means (9) intended to detach the final part of the sheets from the stack (1), a suction head (5) for detaching the head of the sheets from the stack (2), means for entraining each sheet thus detached from the stack (2) in order to move it as far as a roller (16) for applying glue to the respective upper page, and belt means (20) for moving each sheet emerging from the roller (16).

<CLAIMS>
Gluing machine for reinforcing glued sheets with reinforcement carton (22), comprising means
for feeding sheets to be glued, means for driving the sheets thus fed, means for gluing the

sheets thus driven and electronic means for the control of the said means for feeding, driving
and gluing the sheets, with a central unit with programmable microprocessors and a calender

(24a) for compressing each sheet-and-carton assembly, the said means for feeding the sheets
comprising a mobile supporting bridge (1) for a pile of sheets (2) which is subject to the

control of a self-braking electric motor (3); an electronic undulator serving to operate the said
reduction motor (3) and subject to the program of the central unit in order to enable the bridge

(1) to be intermittently raised on each extraction of a sheet from the said pile (2); a supporting
head (6) for a suction system (9) designed to detach the end part of the sheet from the said pile

(2) on the bridge (1) and subject to the action of a suction pump (7); the said head (6) being
provided with a nozzle (10) serving to blow compressed air towards the pile (2) of sheets, in

such a way as to facilitate the detachment of whatever sheet is situated at the top of the pile (2),
and mounted above the pile (2) on a level with the end part of the sheets; a suction head (5)

serving to detach the front part of the sheet from the pile (2) and situated near two driving
rollers (14) for moving the sheet towards and as far as a gluing roller (16) of the machine; the

said head (5) being associated with a perforated belt (8) which forms a closed ring and which is
actuated by a corresponding DC electric motor(11) controlled by a tachymetric dynamo and by

an incremental coder with a transmission belt (12) and pulleys (13) and with a branch passing
between the sheet and the head (5) in such a way as to enable it to be driven by causing the

sheet to adhere to the lower surface of the belt (8) under the effect of the suction exerted by the
head (5) through the holes of the said belt (8); characterized by the fact that the said sheet

feeding means comprises means for the alternating vertical drive of the said head (6), with a
corresponding DC electric motor (25) controlled in its turn by the said central unit in co-operation

with a screw-and-nut assembly (100,110) acting on the body of the head (6). 
Machine in accordance with Claim 1, characterized by the fact that a balance-bar sensor (28) is
associated with the said head (6) and is intended to activate separately two proximity switches

(27) connected to the motor (25) in order to cause it to rotate in one direction or in the other,
thus enabling the head (6) to perform its alternating vertical movement according to its required

correct position in relation to the pile (2) of sheets.
Machine in accordance with Claim 1, characterized by the fact that a belt conveyor (20)
arranged in a closed ring is provided downstream from the gluing roller and is operated by a

corresponding brushless motor for driving the sheet already glued, its height being adjustable in
the vertical direction according to the type of sheet treated: means for the restoration of the

effective length of the belt (20) being provided, with a lever mechanism (19) and a driving
roller (21) which are designed to ensure the correct tension of the belt (20).
