The charger apparatus (300) comprises a primary power supply (302) for supplying power from an external power source to the power charger (300), a power converter (306) coupled to the primary power supply (302) for converting the power received by the primary power supply (302) from the external power source into a form usable by the power charger (300), and a power controller (308) coupled to the power converter (306) for controlling the power applied to the device (200) or the battery (402), or both, whereby, regardless of the rate of charge of the battery (402), a constant current is maintained for charging the battery (402) while the voltage across the device (200) and battery (402), is allowed to vary. To observe the rate of charge of the battery (402), the power charger (300) also includes a charge rate sensor (404) connected to the battery (402) and coupled to the power controller (308) to measure the voltage across the battery (402).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to power supplies
and battery charging systems and, more particularly, to a
battery charging system for portable electronic devices or
electrically powered devices that can function as a universal
power source for powering the portable device, charging the
batteries, or both.Portable electronic devices such as, for example,
personal computers of the notebook, laptop, palmtop, or pen-based
type, digital oscilloscopes, communications analyzers,
surveying equipment, etc., usually have complex power supply
requirements. For example, a portable computer typically drives
a large display, a microprocessor, and a disk drive such as a
floppy disk or hard drive, or both. Early "luggable" personal
computers (PCs), used displays that were small cathode ray tubes
(CRT) with floppy drives. Their power requirements were about
75 to 100 watts and required connection to a wall socket in
order to meet such power requirements. Later, more portable
computers, such as laptops, emerged. These newer systems
eliminated CRTs and replaced them with low-power liquid crystal
displays (LCDs); additionally, smaller disk drives requiring
less space and power replaced the earlier larger drives. These
newer systems reduced their power requirements sufficiently to
enable them to operate on rechargeable batteries.Generally, as shown in FIG. 1A, a portable computer 1
uses a power supply that includes an AC adapter 2 (an external
AC/DC switcher), some form of limited current 3 to trickle
charge the battery, steering diodes 4 to isolate the battery 5
from the raw supply voltage and an internal DC/DC converter 6.
The DC/DC converter operates from either the power external
supply to 6 to 10 internal nickel/cadmium (NiCad) batteries,
which supply power for about one to two hours. This tends to
restrict charging to trickle charge currents and wastes power in
the steering diodes, reducing battery discharge time. To charge the battery rapidly, careful attention must
be paid to the level of charge to prevent overcharging the
battery. A common method to detect full charge is known as
"negative delta V" (-ΔV). This method detects the small
negative change in voltage across the NiCad cell as it becomes
fully charged. To prevent voltage fluctuations across the
battery that could lead to false detection, the rapid charge
current must be held constant and cannot be a function of the
computer load current; or, the battery must be disconnected from
the charger while measuring -ΔV as is done in the example shown
in FIG.
