<ABSTRACT>
A cross laminate of two films, each of which is uniaxially or unbalanced biaxially oriented, the films being arranged so that the major axes of orientation criss-cross each other (steps 1 to 3), is treated in a calendering process in which machine direction ribs are formed which are thicker than the sheet between the ribs and which have a configuration which confers increased resistance to bending over a line perpendicular to the rib. The ribs are formed by a combination of passage between grooved rollers ("lateral calendering") (steps 4 and 6), the grooves of which include inclined walls on opposing grooves between which the material of the laminate is squeezed, longitudinal stretching (step 5) and heat treatment (step 10). In a preferred process a sandwich of two cross-laminates is subjected sequentially to passage between a first set of grooved rollers (step 4), longitudinal stretching (step 5) and passage through a second set of grooved rollers (step 6) in which the undulations created in the first set of rollers are registered with the second set of grooved rollers, followed by heat treatment (step 10), for instance an ironing process. The cross sandwich is then cooled (step 11) and separated into two cross laminates (step 12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an improved cross-laminate of
oriented films of the general type defined in the preamble
of claim 1 and improved processes and apparatus for
manufacturing cross-laminates of this general type.Processes for production cross-laminates of oriented
films are known in particular from GB-A-1,526,722. In this
known invention, the material is melt oriented in a
generally uniaxial manner before cross lamination, and is
biaxially oriented after cross lamination, preferably near
room temperature. The melt orientation may be very weak,
but is always combined with the use of blends of polymers,
which are sufficiently incompatible for formation of a two-or
multiphase grain of polymer under the influence of the
melt-orientation, which grain has a very significant
influence on the strength properties of the final cross-laminate.
In order to enhance the tear-propagation
resistance the bonding between the films is a generally
weak bonding, but may be supplemented with a strong bonding
in spots or lines.The objective of this known invention is to provide
for a film material which exhibits high strength properties
in all respects. One of its important uses is for bags and
similar packaging uses.Further according to the above mentioned British
Patent, the transverse stretching which is subsequent to
the cross-sandwiching of the melt-oriented films (see the
introduction to the independent process claims herein) is
preferably carried out by passing the sandwich through
several sets of mutually intermeshing grooved rollers, the
grooves of which are as fine as practically possible.
Also, the sandwich is normally (but not necessarily)
stretched longitudinally in continuous manner between
smooth rollers before, between or after said steps of
grooved rollers stretching. 
(I distinguish between "sandwiching" which may involve, but
needs not involve a bonding of the films to one another, and
"laminating" which always involves such bonding).
For obtaining optimum energy-absorbing properties (such as e.g.
shock-tear propagation resistance) the different stretching
steps, following the cross-sandwiching, are preferably carried
out at temperatures very much below the melting ranges of the
films, and may even be carried out at normal room temperature.Further according to the above mentioned British Patent, the
cross-lamination of films having a uniaxial or an unbalanced
biaxial malt-orientation can be carried out already in the
extrusion process under use of counterrotating dieparts, but
can also be established on
