<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mounting rack (1) for electrical service apparatuses (installation apparatuses), which mounting rack (1) can be connected to a holder for the mounting rack, for example to busbars. It is proposed that the mounting rack have an adaptor lower part (2), which can be connected to the holder, and an adaptor upper part (3), which is used to accommodate at least one service apparatus, the adaptor lower part (2) and the adaptor upper part (3) being constructed as separate components which can be connected to one another, and it being possible to connect adaptor upper parts of different physical size to an adaptor lower part having a defined physical size. With this design, universal use of the mounting rack becomes possible, particularly taking account of modular construction. While the dimensions of the adaptor upper part are matched to the dimensions of the service apparatus or apparatuses, a standardised adaptor lower part is used for the connection, which can be connected to any of the possible adaptor upper parts. A high level of preassembly of the electrical service apparatus or apparatuses with the mounting rack is thus possible.

An equipment carrier for electrical installation equipment, comprising an 
adapter top (3) provided to receive at least one piece of installation equipment and 

further comprising an adapter base (2) which can be joined to a support, the top (3) 
and base (2) being interconnectable, 
characterised in that
 each adapter top (3, 3', 
3", 3"') can be assembled optionally with an adapter base (2) capable of being fixed 

to a support of the nature of a wall, or with an adapter base (2) capable of being 
fixed to a support of the nature of a bus bar system (5, 6, 7), and can be locked in 

the assembled position, adapter tops (3, 3', 3", 3"') of different overall size being 
connectable to an adapter base (2) of defined overall size, and that each adapter top 

(3) can be joined to another adapter top (3') of the same or different overall size 
which is not associated with the equipment carrier (1) and is intended to receive at 

least one piece of installation equipment. 
An equipment carrier according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 adapter tops 
(3, 3', 3", 3"') of different overall size are of identical structure in the region 

joined to the adapter base (2). 
An equipment carrier according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
joining of the adapter top (3) and adapter base (2) is effected by assembly of the top 

(3) and base (2) and their subsequent relative movement in the dividing plane 
between the top (3) and base (2), the top (3) having holding lugs (39) which engage 

behind holding webs (38) on the base (2) during the relative movement of the parts 
(2, 3). 
An equipment carrier according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 
the adapter top (3) and adapter base (2) are locked by means of at least one locking 

tab (47) on the top (3), which engages behind a locking web (48) on the base (2) in 
the locking position.  

 
An equipment carrier according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 
the adapter top (3) is plate-shaped. 
An equipment carrier according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the adapter 
base (2) is in plate form and contains apertures (60) for hooking the base (2) into 

fastening means joined to the wall. 
An equipment carrier according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the adapter 
base (2) is box-shaped and has hook attachments (4) at its side facing away from the 

top (3), for engaging behind the bus bars (5, 6, 7) 
An equipment carrier according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 means for 
fixing the equipment carrier (1) in the plane of the bus bars (5, 6, 7) perpendicular 

to their length, and electrical contacts 25 for the bus bars (5, 6, 7), which are 
connected to the installation equipment by electrical leads, are provided in the box-shaped 

adapter base (2). 
An equipment carrier according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterised in that
 the box-shaped 
adapter base (2) is provided with an overlap protector in plate form (41) in 

the region of each of its two ends projecting beyond the bus bars (5, 6, 7), the 
protector being connectable to the adapter base (2) and adapter top (3) with a 

locking action. 
An equipment carrier according to claim 9, 
characterised in that
 each 
respective overlap protector (41) has attachments (42, 44), which engage behind the 

adapter base (2) at the side towards the bus bars (5, 6, 7) and behind the adapter top 
(3) at the side remote from the bus bars (5, 6, 7) when the top (3) and base (2) have 

been joined, clip connections being provided to lock the overlap protector (41) to 
the top (3) and base (2).  

 
An equipment carrier according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 additional 
adapter tops (3) are joined to another adapter base (2). 
An equipment carrier according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the adapter 
tops (3, 3"') of two adjacent, spaced equipment carriers (1,1) are joined together by 

means of one or more additional adapter tops (3', 3"), which bridge the gap 
between the tops (3, 3'") associated with the two equipment carriers (1, 1). 
An equipment carrier according to claim 11 or 12, 
characterised in that
 the 
adapter top (3) and additional adapter top (3') can be joined together by connecting 

members (53) in the regions facing towards each other. 
An equipment carrier according to claim 13, 
characterised in that
 for joining 
the adapter top (3) to the additional top (3') the respective connecting member (53)

respective web (10, 11) of the adapter top (3) and additional adapter top (3') is 

provided at the side towards the respective other top (3', 3) with at least one 
attachment (52) which is undercut longitudinally of the web (10, 11), the 

attachments (52) of the tops (3, 3') to be joined being arranged in mirror image to
