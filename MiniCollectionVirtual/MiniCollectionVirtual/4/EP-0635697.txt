<ABSTRACT>
A measuring device is proposed which has a measuring head (14) and is used for laser-assisted measurement of the length of and distance from measuring objects. The measuring head (14) of the measuring device is connected to a laser interferometer (20) and has devices for transmitting and receiving a reflected laser beam (16). It is particularly important that the measuring head (14) can be inserted exchangeably into a measuring or testing device (1).

A single-coordinate measuring arrangement having an
interchangeably usable measuring head (14) for laser-assisted length and

distance measurement from or to objects to be measured, wherein the
measuring head (14) has a laser interferometer (20) and devices for

emitting a laser beam and receiving a reflected laser beam (16), and is
connected to a measurement value evaluation unit (24) and a measurement

value display, wherein

provided in the measuring arrangement (1) and at a spacing relative
to the measuring head (14) are two measuring sensors (5, 6) which are

spaced relative to each other axially on the coordinate axis and the
longitudinal axes of which are aligned with each other,
the first measuring sensor (6) which is closer to the measuring
head (14) is axially displaceable on the coordinate axis,
the first measuring sensor (6) has a first end face which is
aligned with the facing end face of the second measuring sensor (5),
the first measuring sensor (6) has a second end face which is
opposite to the first end face and which is aligned with the emitted laser

beam (16) of the laser interferometer (20), and
the first measuring sensor (6) is fixed in or on a measuring
carriage (7) with a defined adjustable measuring force regulation and fine

adjustment.
A measuring arrangement according to claim 1 wherein the
measuring head (14) is connected by a glass fibre line (19) to the laser

interferometer (20) and has optical devices for emitting and receiving the
laser beam (16) reflected by the first measuring sensor (6) or an object

(10, 28) to be measured.
A measuring arrangement according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein
the measuring head (14) has selectively usable sensors for the measurement

of air humidity, air temperature and temperature of the object (10) to be
measured as well as the air pressure, which are connected to the

measurement value evaluation unit (24) for compensation of the measurement
results.
