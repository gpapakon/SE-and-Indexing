<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a voltage generator
circuit and, more particularly, to such a circuit
generating and supplying a negative bias voltage to
a substrate or well regions of a semiconductor memory
device.While a semiconductor device is supplied at its
substrate and/or well region with a predetermined potential,
in a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device, a fixed
negative potential is applied to the substrate or well
regions thereof in which n-type MOS transistors are formed.
This is because to reverse-bias a p-n junction formed
between each of n-type source and drain regions of an
n-type MOS transistors and the substrate or well regions.
With the reverse-biased condition, the p-n junction has
a smaller junction capacitance to thereby make each
transistor operate at high speed. Thus, the DRAM
device includes a voltage generator circuit generating
and supplying the negative potential to the substrate
or well regions. The conventional negative voltage generator circuit
consists of a low-potential signal generator circuit
generating, in response to a clock signal oscillating
between the supply potential (Vcc) and the ground
potential (GND), a negative clock signal oscillating
between GND and -Vcc, an output terminal connected to
the substrate, and an output transistor consisting of
a p-type MOS transistor with its source-drain path
placed between the output terminal connected to the substrate and the output
terminal of the low-potential signal generator circuit.
The output transistor turns on and off repeatedly in
accordance with the negative clock signal applied to
its gate, and the output terminal and accordingly the
substrate are thus pulled down to a negative potential.However, the output transistor is turned ON when
applied at its gate with -Vcc level clock signal. For
this reason, the output terminal (i.e., the substrate)
is clamped at such a potential level that is higher than
-Vcc level by the threshold level VTP of the output
transistor, namely, -Vcc + |VTP|. For example, in the
cases of Vcc being 3 volts and |VTP| being 1.5 volts,
the voltage level of the output terminal, that is the
substrate potential is clamped at -1.5 volts.In US-A-4 336 466 a negative voltage generator circuit is disclosed
in which the gate of the MOS transistor is connected to the output terminal.
Also this negative voltage generator circuit is only able to clamp the
substrate potential at a value which is -Vcc plus the absolute
value of the transistors threshold voltage.Such a small substrate bias voltage
