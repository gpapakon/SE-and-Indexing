<ABSTRACT>
A clutch-brake type roll blind in which a screen is rolled up by means of a spring, characterized in that a 
pulling cord need not be attached to a weight bar even in a case where the blind is installed on a window which 

extends from the floor to a portion close to the ceiling. A rotating shaft (14) rotating integrally with a roll (10) is made 
to protrude from one side of the roll (10) so as to be rotatably supported on one of brackets, and a pulley (22) capable 

of rotationally driving the roll (10) in a screen pulling-out direction is mounted on the rotating shaft (14) integrally or 
via a one-way clutch so as to rotate together with the rotating shaft. An operation cord member such as a ball chain 

(23) is set over the pulley, whereby the ball chain (23) is operated so as to roll up or down the screen (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in a 
roll blind of which the screen is pulled down by hand and 
rolled up by a wind-up spring. JP Y S63-41516 and JP Y H1-26871 disclose the roll 
blind of which the screen is pulled down by hand and rolled 
up by the winding spring. The roll blind comprises a tube 
for rolling up the screen thereon, a fixed shaft for 
rotatably supporting one end portion of the tube, a wind-up 
spring interposed between the tube and the fixed shaft, a 
clutch brake interposed between the tube and the fixed shaft 
for selectively rotating the tube. The screen is usually 
provided at its free end with a weight bar. The clutch brake 
allows the tube to roll down the screen therefrom, when the 
weight bar is pulled down. The clutch brake prevents the 
tube from rolling the screen down therefrom and up thereon, 
when the weight bar is released after being substantially 
lowered. However, the clutch brake again allows the tube to 
be rotated by the wind-up spring in the direction in which 
the screen is rolled up on the tube, when the weight bar is 
released after being slightly lowered. While the screen is 
rolled up by the winding spring, its speed can be reduced by 
the use of a reduction mechanism interposed between the tube 
and the fixed shaft. The clutch brake as described above is 
disclosed by JP B S63-34950. The aforementioned reduction 
mechanism is disclosed by JP Y H1-26871. When the roll blind is mounted in a tall window 
extending from floor to ceiling, the weight bar is usually 
provided with a pulling string. The string enables one to  
 
operate the roll blind even if the screen is rolled up at a 
high position beyond one's reach. However, when the screen 
is lowered near the floor, the string inconveniently lies at 
full length on the floor. EP-A-0 481 688 is providing a corded roll blind 
in which a pulling string is eliminated from the weight bar. The present invention is intended to improve such design. The present invention consists in a roll blind 
according to claim 1.  
 When the weight bar or endless pulling member is 
drawn down in the direction in which the screen is rolled 
down, the clutch brake allows the tube to rotate in the 
direction in which the screen is rolled down therefrom. When 
the weight bar or the pulling member is released after being 
substantially drawn, the clutch brake prevents the tube from 
rotating, so that the weight bar remains at a position 
lowered from the initial position. When the weight bar or 
the pulling member is

<CLAIMS>
A corded roll blind comprising a tube (10) for rolling up a 
screen (11) thereon, a fixed shaft (13) for rotatably supporting one 

annular end piece (19) which is fixedly fitted in one end portion of 
said tube, a clutch brake (18) interposed between said tube and said 

fixed shaft for selectively rotating said tube, a wind-up spring (21) 
interposed between said tube and said fixed shaft for rotating said 

tube in the direction in which said screen is rolled up on said tube, 
a rotary shaft (14) fitted in the other annular end piece (20) which 

is fixedly fitted in the other end portion of said tube for rotation 
therewith and projecting partly therefrom, a pair of brackets (14, 15) 

for supporting said fixed and rotary shafts, a pulley (22) rotatably 
fitted on and coupled with said rotary shaft with the intervention of 

a one-way clutch type coil spring (24), an endless pulling member 
(23) drivingly hung from said pulley, whereby said pulley can rotate 

said tube (10) only when said pulling member (23) is drawn in the 
direction in which said screen (11) is rolled down,
 
   
characterized in
 
that said rotary shaft (14) has an outer axle (25) put into a bore in 

the bracket (16), a flange (26) in contact with the outer face of the 
pulley (22), a central axle (27) rotatably fitted in the bore of the 

pulley (22) and an inner axle (28) being diametrically smaller than 
said central axle (27) and fitted in said coil spring (24),  

 

said inner axle (28) being formed with a key groove (31) for 
coupling engagement with a key (30) provided in the inner periphery 

of said other end piece (20), 
said pulley (22) having a sleeve portion (32) rotatably fitted on 
the central axle (27) and a slit (33) formed in said sleeve portion 

for fitting engagement with one end (34) of the coil spring (24), 
whereby said coil spring (24) coils on said rotary shaft when said 

pulley turns in the direction in which said screen is rolled down and 
uncoils from said rotary shaft when said pulley turns in the counter 

direction. 
A corded roll blind as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
said pulling member is a ball chain (23).
