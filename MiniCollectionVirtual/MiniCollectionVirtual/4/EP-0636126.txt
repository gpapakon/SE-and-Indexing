<ABSTRACT>
Sclareolide, an important preliminary product for the production of the perfume ambroxane, is accessible in large quantities with short reaction times by the reaction of sclareol and/or abienol in an aqueous medium and in the absence of an organic solvent with a 10.5 to 25-fold molar quantity of an oxidising agent in the presence of a ruthenium catalyst and an emulsifier to form a raw product and either (i) its conversion in the presence of a base into the salt of 8 alpha -hydroxy-11-carboxy-12,13,14,15,16-pentanorlabdane and its further cycling in an acid medium, or (ii) is subsequent reaction at increased temperature and subsequent distillation, whereby the post-reaction may also, if desired, take place in situ during distillation.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of sclareolide, 
characterized 
in that
 sclareol and/or abienol is reacted with 
10.5 to 25 times the molar quantity - based on sclareol 

and/or abienol - of an oxidizing agent in aqueous medium 
in the absence of an organic solvent and in the presence 

of a ruthenium catalyst and an emulsifier to form a crude 
product which, thereafter, is either 


(i) converted in the presence of a base into the salt of 
8α-hydroxy-11-carboxy-12,13,14,15,16-pentanorlabdane 

which is then cyclized in acidic medium to form 
sclareolide
 
or 
(ii) is subjected to an after-reaction at elevated 
temperature and subsequently distilled, the after-reaction 

optionally taking place in situ during the 
distillation phase. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 sodium hypochlorite is used as the oxidizing agent. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized 
in that
 a nonionic surfactant is used as the emulsifier. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that
 the oxidation is carried out at a 
temperature of 15 to 70°C. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 

characterized in that
 the ruthenium catalyst is used in 
a quantity of 0.1 to 5 mole-%, based on sclareol and/or 

abienol. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that
 RuCl
3
 is used as the ruthenium 
catalyst. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, 

characterized in that
 the oxidation is carried out in a 
particularly fine-particle dispersion.
