<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for filling and closing a packaging means is provided with a filling device (11) which receives a bulk material, for example potatoes, carrots or the like, supplied under the effect of gravity and by means of which the bulk material is packaged in a continuous knitted fabric (3) separable, after filling, in the form of two-seam bags or sacks, and, in the filled state, this can be closed in the region of an upper filling orifice (12) via a closing member (17). The apparatus (1) has a first severing member severing the continuous knitted fabric (3) running off from a stock roll (4) and a feed part (8) which positions the pre-divided two-seam bags or sacks in a vertical advancing plane (10) and downstream of which, in the direction of advance of the continuous knitted fabric (3), is arranged a guide plate (9) which, in the region below a filling funnel (11), forms the upper filling orifice (12) of the respective bags or sacks, these are closed by means of respective pressing members (13, 14) of an advance part (15), the connecting webs thereafter enter the region of the closing part (17), and in the region of the latter both a fastening member (18) and a second severing member (19) are provided.
