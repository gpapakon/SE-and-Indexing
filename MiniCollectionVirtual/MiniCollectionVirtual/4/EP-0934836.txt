<ABSTRACT>
Some of the raised tread block areas (1) have fine cuts (2a,2b) and the projection from the base of the cut forms a rib in the region closest to the cut base. The outer ends (7a,7b) of the projections broaden out to form a circular shape when viewed perpendicular to the cut. Independent claims are also included for: (a) lamellae which have slit-like openings extending from their free end into a circular shaped cut-out facing the root of the lamellae; and (b) a tire vulcanizing mold including the lamellae. Preferred Features: The radial length of the rib is greater than its width which is constant in the area close to the base of the cut. The radial distance of the broadened area of the projections to the tire tread surface can vary. When viewed perpendicular to the tread surface the cuts (2a,2b) form a honeycomb of regular hexagons, those at the edges of the raised tread areas being open to the outer edges.

Vehicle pneumatic tyre

having a tread strip
and a profile on this tread strip
some profile positives (1) being subdivided by fine incisions
(2a, 2b) therein into profile positive parts,
at least one of the fine incisions (2a and/or 2b) having a
raised portion (6) of the incision base, which raised portion

has a web-like configuration in a radially inner region in a
manner known per se,
on the other hand, having an enlargement (7a, 7b) on its
radially outer end
which enlargement is situated in the cut face produced by the
relevant incision,
characterised in that

the enlargement (7a, 7b) has a circular configuration.
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the radial extension of the radially inner, web-like region of the base
raised portion, i.e. the radial size of a non-raised region of the

incision base up to the radially inner delimitation of the
enlargement (7a, 7b), is greater than its maximum width.
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the base raised portion of the incision is configured in the web-like,
radially inner region at least with a constant width.
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of the claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the smallest radial spacing of enlargements 
(7a, 7b) in incisions (2a, 2b), measured relative to the profile

surface, is different within one profile positive (1).
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to claim 4, 
characterised in that

the smallest radial spacing of enlargements (7b), which are
measured relative to the profile surface and are adjacent to profile

positive edges, is smaller than of enlargements (7a) which are
disposed in the interior of the profile positive (1).
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of the claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
, at least in the central region of the profile
positive (1), the incisions (2a, 2b), seen in plan view, form a network

of at least regular hexagons.
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to claim 6, 
characterised in that

the incisions (2b), which open outwardly at profile positive edges,
form partial regions of the network of hexagons.
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in
that
, in at least some incisions (2a, 2b) respectively, at least one
single enlargement (7) is configured.
Lamella (4)

suitable for use in a tyre vulcanisation mould within the
region which impresses incisions in the tread strip,
the lamella (4) having a depression (6) of its incising end face
towards the root of the lamella,
this depression (6) of this end face having a slot-like
configuration in a manner known per se in a region which is

near to the incising end face,
characterised in that
 the depression, on the other hand, has an
enlargement (7a, 7b) on its end which is orientated towards the root

of the lamella, i.e. radially outer end in the incorporated state,
which enlargement is situated in the plane of the lamella and has a

circular configuration.
Lamella (4) according to claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the radial
extension of the known per se, slot-like region of the depression of

the incising end face of the lamella (4), i.e. the radial size of a non-depressed
region of the incising end face up to the transition into

the enlargement (7a, 7b), is larger than the maximum width of this
slot-like region.
Tyre vulcanisation mould, which has lamellae projecting radially
inwardly in the region which is intended for the impression of the

tread region of tyres, at least some of these lamellae (4) being
configured according to claim 9.
Tyre vulcanisation mould according to claim 11, in which lamellae
(4) are disposed such that they form a honeycombed lamellar

network, 
characterised in that
, within the aforementioned
honeycombed lamellar network, lamellae according to claim 9 are

used at least partially.
