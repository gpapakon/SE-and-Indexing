<ABSTRACT>
A case, in particular a spectacle case, consisting of two shells (1, 2) made of plastic and preferably linked to one another via a film hinge (3), having a closure on the longitudinal sides located opposite the hinge (3), said closure comprising engageable knobs (11) and grooves (12) in the overlapping region of the front wall (9) of the shells (11, 12), at least the sections of the front wall (9) being of resiliently bendable construction in the region of the knobs (11) and grooves (12) in such a way that the closure opens under slight tension, and a holding web (14) which engages behind the counter-shell in the closure region, being moulded on the inside onto the front wall (9) of the shell (2) which engages over the shell (1) on the outside, which holding web only permits bending of the front wall (9) of the counter-shell allowing disengagement.
