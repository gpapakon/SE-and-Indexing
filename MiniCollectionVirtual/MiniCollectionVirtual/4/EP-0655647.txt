<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a color filter,
and a liquid crystal panel equipped with the color
filter, wherein the color filter
is suitable for a color liquid crystal display which can
be used in a color television, a personal computer or
the like. More specifically, it relates to a method of manufacture by the
utilization of an ink jet recording technique of a color
filter for liquid crystal displays, and a liquid
crystal panel equipped with the color filter.In recent years, there has been a tendency that
the demand of liquid crystal displays, particularly
color liquid crystal displays increases with the
development of personal computers, particularly
portable personal computers. However, for the further
spread of the liquid crystal displays, it is necessary
to lower their costs, and particularly with regard to
the color filter which largely occupies the cost of
each display, request for its cost reduction increases.
In order to meet the required characteristics of the
color filter and to satisfy the above-mentioned demand, 
various attempts have been heretofore made, but any
method which can meet all of the required
characteristics has not been established so far. Some
methods for manufacturing the color filter will be
described below.A first method which has most often been used is a
dyeing method. This dyeing method comprises coating a
glass substrate with an aqueous polymer material which
is a material to be dyed, patterning the material into
a desired shape by a photolithography process, and then
immersing the thus obtained pattern in a dyeing bath to
obtain a colored pattern. This operation is repeated
three times to form the colored layers of Red (R),
Green (G) and Blue (B).Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 5-288913
has described another example of this dyeing method
which comprises forming a photosensitive layer,
exposing it to light through a pattern, dyeing
unexposed portions, and then repeating this process to
manufacture a color filter having three colors of R, G
and B.A second method is a pigment dispersion method,
which is now being replaced with the above-mentioned
dyeing method. This pigment dispersion method
comprises first forming, on a substrate, a
photosensitive resin layer in which a pigment is
dispersed, and then patterning the resin layer to 
obtain a single-colored pattern. Next, this process is
repeated three times to form colored layers having
three colors of R, G and B.A third method is an electrodeposition method.
This method comprises

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacture of a color filter, wherein

in a first step a resin layer (3) to be colored by ink-jet printing is formed on a substrate (1),
said method being 
characterized by
 the additional steps of:

reducing the ink accepting property of portions (8) between adjacent
areas for different colors of said resin layer (3) by exposing said portions

(8) to light irradiation or the combination of light irradiation and heat
treatment so as to cure said portions;
providing a plurality of colorants having different colors to areas of the resin layer not
exposed in said exposure step, using an ink-jet printing system (5) to form

a pattern of the plurality of colors, and
curing the colored portions of the resin layer (3) by
light irradiation or heating.
The method according to claim 1, wherein

a protective layer (6) is formed on the resin layer (3).
The method according to anyone of claims 1 to 2, wherein

the substrate (1) is provided with shade portions (2) thereon, and the ink
accepting property of portions of the resin layer (3) on the shade portions

(2) is reduced in said reducing step.
The method according to claim 3, wherein

the width of the cured portions of the resin layer (3) on the shade portions (2) is
smaller than that of the shade portions (2). 
The method according to anyone of claims 1 to 4, wherein

the resin layer (3) comprises a residue of a hydrophilic group which in light
ir
radiation portions is decreased by light irradiation or by a combination of
light irradiation and heating.
The method according to claim 5, wherein

the resin layer (3) contains a compound for forming an acid under said light
irradiation.
The method according to anyone of claims 1 to 6, wherein

said resin layer (3) comprises at least

a) a homopolymer of a monomer comprising a structure unit represented
by the following formula (I) and/or a copolymer of the above

mentioned monomer and another vinyl monomer, and
b) a compound selected from the group consisting of halogenated triazine
compounds, diphenyliodonium salt derivatives and triphenylsulfonium

salt derivatives:


wherein

R
1
 is hydrogen or a methyl group; and
R
2
 is hydrogen or an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms.
The method according to claim 7, wherein

the compound b) is present in an amount of from 0.01 to 10 parts by
weight per 100 parts by weight of the copolymer a).
A method of manufacture of a liquid crystal panel,

comprising the steps of:

providing a color filter produced by the method according to anyone of
claims 1 to 8;
providing a second substrate (14) at a position opposite to the color
filter; and
enclosing a liquid crystal composition (12) between the color filter and
the second substrate (14).
The method according to claim 9 as dependant on claim 1, wherein

the second substrate (14) is provided with shade portions (2) thereon.
