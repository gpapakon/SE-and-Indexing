<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for cutting a product into slices 
comprises a support frame (1) with opposite attachment elements (4,5) 

and a cutting wire (2) attached to the support frame (1) by 
deformation of the attachment elements (4,5) as a plurality of 

substantially mutual parallel wire sections (3) at an equal 
spacing. The cutting wire (2) is guided around the sides of the 

attachment elements (4,5) directed away from each other. The 
distance between the said sides of the attachment elements (4,5) 

directed away from each other is enlarged by the deformation 
of the attachment elements as compared to said distance before 

deformation of the attachment elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for cutting a 
product into slices according to the preamble of claim 1 and 
to a method for manufacturing such an apparatus. In the known apparatus of this type the cutting wire 
is clamped between the attachment elements and the support 
frame by bending the attachment elements. In this manner it is 
quite difficult to obtain an apparatus with a cutting wire 
well tightened. The invention aims to provide an apparatus of the 
above-mentioned type wherein a cutting wire well tightened is 
guaranteed in a simple manner. To this end the apparatus of the invention is 
characterized by the characterizing features of claim 1. In this manner an apparatus is obtained wherein a 
cutting wire well tightened is guaranteed due to the 
deformation of the attachment elements. According to a favourable embodiment the opposite 
attachment elements are staggered with respect to each other 
substantially along the intermediate distance between the wire 
sections, wherein a distance element is provided between each 
two attachment elements being successive transverse to the 
longitudinal direction of the wire sections, wherein the 
distance elements seen transverse to the longitudinal 
direction of the wire sections, have an equal length and 
wherein the spacing between the distance elements is 
substantially equal to this length increased by twice the 
cutting wire diameter. In this manner it is obtained that the spacing 
between the wire sections of the cutting wire is determined by 
the distance elements, so that the deformation of the 
attachment elements does not affect this spacing. Moreover, 
the cutting wire needs to be guided only once along each 
attachment element. The invention further aims to provide a method for 
manufacturing such an apparatus, wherein a cutting wire is 
guided around the sides of opposite deformable distance  
 
elements of a support frame, said sides being directed away 
from each other, in a tightly tightened manner and the cutting 
wire is attached as a plurality of wire sections mutually 
substantially parallel and lying at an equal spacing on the 
support frame by deforming said attachment elements, said 
method according to the invention being characterized in that 
the attachment elements are deformed in such a manner that the 
distance between the sides of the attachment elements directed 
away from each other, is enlarged. The invention will be further explained by reference 
to the drawings in which an embodiment of the apparatus of the
