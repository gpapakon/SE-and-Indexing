<ABSTRACT>
[OBJECT] The present invention provides a pressure 

control valve to be provided in a line interconnecting a 
master cylinder and a brake cylinder, comprising a 

relatively small number of component parts.
 

[CONSTITUTION] A pressure control valve (Cv) has an 

outer piston (38) comprising, in an integral unit, a 
proportional pressure reducing piston (36) and a 

pressure reducing piston (37) and slidably fitted in a 
cylinder (34) by means of which an inlet port (31) 

communicates with an outlet port (32). When the braking 
pressure applied to the pressure control valve (Cv) 

increases, the outer piston (38) moves downward against 
the resilience of a proportional pressure reducing 

spring (53) to reduce the rate of increase of the output 
pressure in cooperation with a cut valve (44). When the 

input pressure increases further, the a cut piston (46) 
moves upward against the resilience of a cut spring (48) 

to hold the output pressure on a fixed level. When the 
input pressure increases still further, the outer piston 

(38) moves further downward against the resilience of a 
proportional pressure reducing spring (51) to reduce the 

output pressure. The proportional pressure reducing  
 

piston (36) and the pressure reducing piston (37) are 
formed in a single unit, the pressure control valve (Cv) 

has a relatively small number of component parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a braking force 
controller inserted in a line interconnecting a master 
cylinder and a brake cylinder to regulate an input 
hydraulic pressure transmitted from the master cylinder 
thereto and and transmits an output hydraulic pressure 
to the brake cylinder. Such a braking force controller is disclosed, for 
example, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-40672. When incorporating a proportional pressure reducing 
means for reducing increase in output hydraulic pressure 
corresponding to increase in input hydraulic pressure, a 
pressure holding means for holding the output hydraulic 
pressure at a fixed value regardless of the increase of 
the input hydraulic pressure, and a pressure reducing 
means for reducing the output hydraulic pressure when 
the input hydraulic pressure increases into a braking 
force controller to be inserted in a line 
interconnecting a master cylinder and a brake cylinder  
 
for the rear wheel of a motorcycle to distribute braking 
force to the front wheel and the rear wheel of the 
motorcycle at a braking force distribution ratio as 
close to an ideal braking force distribution ratio as 
possible, the proportional pressure reducing means and 
the pressure reducing means are provided respectively 
with a proportional pressure reducing piston and a 
pressure reducing piston. Therefore, the conventional 
braking force controller needs a comparatively large 
number of parts and has a comparatively large size. Known from EP-A-0 082 044 is a brake regulator for a vehicle in 
which in a regulator body there is provided a stepped cylinder 
bore. In the stepped cylinder bore, a piston is provided which is 
axially movable. One end of the piston is extending to the exterior 
of the regulator body and a force corresponding to the wheel 
load can be applied thereto. Provided in the stepped bore is an 
axially movable separating wall member which in its central portion 
comprises a valve opening. Provided at the other end of the 
piston is a valve member which can be seated on the valve opening 
for closing same. The axially movable separating wall member 
separates an inlet and an outlet chamber from each other. The 
portion of the piston projecting into the stepped bore is provided 
with stepped regions for decreasing its diameter from the 
outer end to the end at which a valve member is provided. Thus 
due to the pressure generated in the inlet chamber and due to the 
stepped regions on the piston, the piston is forced into a direction 
to close the
