<ABSTRACT>
Car windows provided with an enamelled band and mounted in the bodywork of a vehicle by means of the gluing method receive an individual inscription by means of a laser beam. In this case, use is made of a laser beam having a wavelength for which the window is substantially transparent. The inscription is made by focusing the laser beam on a band formed of at least one layer of enamel, particularly forming a decorative frame, on an inaccessible part of the enamel band, particularly the area covered over by a bead of glue or a plastic profile, so that it is impossible to remove or modify the inscription.

<CLAIMS>
Process for marking a glazing by means of a laser beam, by focussing a 
laser beam having a wavelength for which the glazing is substantially transparent, 

across at least part of the glazing onto a layer absorbing the laser 
beam, characterized in that it is applied in the case of a glazing installed in 

the body of the vehicle by bonding and having a strip formed by at least one 
enamel layer, particularly in the form of a decorative frame, the marking more 

particularly taking place on an inaccessible part of the enamel band, by 
focussing the laser beam onto the enamel layer forming the band. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the enamel band is 
placed on the face of the glazing oriented towards the passenger compartment 

of the vehicle, marking taking place from the outside on a part of the band 
covered by a bonding bead or a plastics material section. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the enamel band is 
placed on one face of an inner glass sheet of the glazing.
