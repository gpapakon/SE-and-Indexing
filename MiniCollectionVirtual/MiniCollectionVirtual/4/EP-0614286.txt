A remote control device for video/audio apparatuses comprising

a casing (14),
operational controls (18) for actuating functions of the video/audio apparatuses,
electrical and/or electronic circuits for emitting operational signals to the
video/audio apparatuses,
characterized by
a tilted lid (12) mounted movably to the casing (14), which lid covers at least
one essential operational control (18) in one end position a
nd exposes the or every
covered operational control (18) in the other end position, and by
at least one assembly formed on the lid (12) to accommodate an exchangeable
information carrier (24).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the lid (12) is pivotably
mounted to the casing (14) by at least one hinge-like holding means (20).
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the lid (12) is eccentrically
hinged to the hinge-like holding means (20) so that said lid (12) remains upright in the

position uncovering the operational controls (18).
A device according to any of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that at least
one clamp or stop element is positioned on the lid (12) and/or the casing (14), which

element reversibly holds said lid (12) in the position covering the operational controls
(18) and/or in the position uncovering the operational controls.
A device according to any of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the lid
(12) is equipped with at least one holding means (22a, 22b, 22c) to hold or to 

accommodate an information carrier (24).
A device according to claim 5, characterised in that the carrier (24) is
exchangably arranged in or on the lid (12).
A device according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the information
carrier (24) is a card, i.e. a sheet of paper, carton or a synthetic material.
A device according to any of the claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the
information carrier (24) comprises an illustration at least on its inner surface facing

the control elements (18).
A device according to any of the claims 1 to 8, characterised in that at least
part of the lid (12) consists of a transparent material.
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that the lid (12) consists of a
transparent synthetic material.
A device according to claim 9 or 10, characterised in that the information
carrier (24) has illustrations on both faces.
A device according to any of the claims 7 to 11, characterised in that the card
(24) is detachably held to the lid (12) by at least one clamp or stop element (28).
A device according to any of the claims 7 to 12, characterised in that the card
(24) is held in slit guides on both edges of the lid (12).
A device according to any of the claims 7 to 13, characterised in that at least
two projections (22a, 22b, 22c) are provided on the side of the lid (12) facing the

casing (14) so that the card (24) can be inserted between the lid (12) and the 
projections (22a, 22b, 22c).
A device according to any of the claims 1 to 14, characterised in that the lid
(12) is formed integrally with at least one information surface.
A device according to any of the claims 1 to 15, characterised in that the angle
between the control panel of the casing (14) and the lid (12) is between 60째 and 200째,

especially between 90째 and 150째, when the lid (12) is in the open position.
A device according to any of the claims 1 to 16, characterised in that the lid
(12) can be mounted by means of bores and pins forming a hinge on the narrow

longitudinal edges of the casing (14) of a remote control device to be equipped
subsequently with such a lid.
A device according to any of the claims 2 to 17, characterised in that the
hinge-like holding means (20) of the lid (12) is made childproof and requires a tool

for unlocking.
A device according to claim 18, characterised in that the childproof holding
means is equipped with a pin extending into an opening and movable by means of a

tool.
