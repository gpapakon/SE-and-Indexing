<ABSTRACT>
The prosthesis comprises a femoral implant (1) with its two condyle sections (10, 11) extended inwards, on either side of the inter-condyle groove (12) to form two parallel flanges (13, 14) which have their upper edges linked at the rear by a transverse bar (17) of rounded section. The tibial implant (2) of the prosthesis has a plate (4) with a central projection (43) which has a transverse rear wall (44) and two parallel side walls (45, 46), all perpendicular to the plate's surface. The width of the projection is slightly less than that of the inter-condyle groove, so that it can fit with a clearance between the two flanges and transverse bar of the femoral implant. The tibial plate is fixed to a base (3) with the aid of an anchoring element (31) and locking plates (32), as well as a screw (47) fitted through a hole (49) in the projection.
