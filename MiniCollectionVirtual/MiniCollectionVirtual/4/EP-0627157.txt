<ABSTRACT>
A method of control of a plasma stream formed by at least two plasma-forming gas, in which the gas jets are acted on by passing electric currents therethrough and superposing a magnetic field on each jet. One of the physical parameters of the total plasma stream is monitored and, if it has changed, the magnitude of the force acting on at least one of the converging jets is varied until a required result is obtained. This method is effected by using a plasma apparatus including at least two plasma burners (1) arranged at an angle to each other and connected to a power supply (7) and to a plasma-forming gas source (8). Each burner (1) is provided with an open magnetic circuit (4) with a solenoid (5) connected to a power supply (6). The apparatus is provided with a unit (9) for recording the physical parameters of the plasma stream (2). The unit (9) for recording the physical parameters is connected to a processing unit (10) whose outputs are connected to the power supplies (6) and (7) and to the plasma-forming gas source (8). The burners (1) are provided with a drive (3) which is also connected to the processing unit (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plasma treatment 
technique and, more particularly, the invention relates 
to a method of control of a plasma jet and to a plasma 
apparatus. The invention can be used in the electronic industry, 
mechanical engineering, instrumentation and in other 
fields of science and technology where the plasma 
treatment is used. Known in the art is a method of control of a plasma 
stream, in which the such a stream is formed by a system 
of converging plasma jets, and characterized in that a 
magnetic system is used for superposing magnetic fields 
on the current-conducting plasma jets. This procedure 
makes it possible to change the characteristics of the 
plasma stream, such as its shape, size, and the position 
of the plasma jets, by varying the magnetic field 
intensity. This method, however, has disadvantages since 
it does not provide control of the characteristics of 
the total plasma stream very important for the final 
results of the plasma treatment, such as the radiation 
brightness distribution in the plasma stream cross-section, 
or the distribution of the density of ions 
and active atoms near the surface bring treated.  
 
Furthermore, the prior art method does not provide a 
possibility of accurate reproduction of the plasma stream 
parameters having the same longevity (PCT 90/00286 of 
December 26, 1990, IPC HO5 B 7/22). Also known in the art is a device for controlling a 
plasma stream (PCT 90/00266 of December 26, 1990, 
IPC HO5 B 7/22) comprising two plasma burners whose 
longitudinal axes are disposed at an angle to each other. 
The plasma burners are connected to an electric current 
supply and communicate with a source of a plasma-forming 
gas. Each plasma burner is provided with a magnetic 
system made in the form of an open magnetic circuit with 
a solenoid connected to a power supply source. This prior 
art device has all the disadvantages of the above-described 
method. A basic object of the invention is to provide a 
method for controlling a plasma stream formed by plasma-forming 
jets which would allow one to obtain preset 
physical parameters of the total plasma stream. This object is attained by providing a method of 
control of a plasma stream formed by at least two 
plasma-forming gas jets, through which an electric 
current flows and a magnetic field is superposed on each 
plasma jet; according to the invention, one of the physical 
parameters of the total plasma stream is monitored and,  
 
in the case of its change, an appropriate action is 
take
