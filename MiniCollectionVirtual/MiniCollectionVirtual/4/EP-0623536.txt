<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for stacking plate-like goods (plates), especially sheet-metal plates, in which the plates (9), in a mutually spaced series arrangement, are successively fed in a direction (18) of translational motion to a stacking position, where they are successively deposited one above the other, to form a stack (8), in a depositing direction running transversely to the translational motion. Provision is made for the execution of a braking which reduces the successive spacing between the plates during the depositing operation, in such a way that the respective plate, before reaching its end position assigned to the direction of translational motion, loses speed, so that the still unbraked or less sharply braked following plate (9B) approaches the (preceding) plate (9A) in the direction of translational motion.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (1) for stacking plates (9), in particular sheet-metal plates, which are advanced
in succession along a horizontal transporting plane (17) in a translatory manner by means

of a transporting arrangement (15) at the end of which the underside of a first plate (9) is
acted upon in the region of the front edge (13) thereof by a first air stream and then the

rear-edge region of the first plate (9) is sucked by suction effect towards a impact
surface (30) and there is braked by means of a brake arrangement (31), so that the front

edge (13) of a plate (9) following the first plate (9) overlaps without contact the rear edge
(14) of the first plate (9), characterised in that the transporting arrangement (15) conveys

the plates (9) at a distance from one another, in that the first air stream (26) and
therebelow the impact surface (30) of the brake arrangement (31) extend parallel to the

transporting plane (17) and the impact surface is such in distance from the transporting
plane (17) and is such in length that a plate (9) rests on a air cushion in the region of its

front edge (13), while in the region of its rear edge (14) it is moved towards the impact
surface (30) through suction effect due to a underpressure.
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 1, characterised by a stop against which the front
edge (13) of the specific braked plate (9) in question impacts at reduced speed for stack

formation.
Apparatus in accordance with either one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that at
least one second air outlet (25) co-operating with a fan (20) is associated with the end

region, facing a stacking table (4), of the impact surface (30), a second air stream
directed approximately in the transporting direction (18) issuing from this second air

outlet (25).
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that the second air outlet (25) is
in the form of a second air nozzle in such a manner that the region of the rear edge of a

plate (9) is moved in the depositing direction during depositing through suction effect
due to a further underpressure.
