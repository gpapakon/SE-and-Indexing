<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for forming a plasma jet. 
More particularly the present invention relates to a device for forming a plasma 
jet wherein the reactant is fed axially into the plasma jet forming nozzle. In traditional plasma spraying a plasma flame is generated using 
a torch generally water cooled and having a tungsten cathode and a conical 
copper anode. Reactant which may be liquid, gaseous, solid or mixtures thereof, 
is entrained into the hot plasma flame by injection radially to the plasma jet. 
If the reactant is a powder it is generally carried by and driven into the plasma 
jet by a carrier gas. The reactant is injected radially into the plasma flame either 
within the anode channel (nozzle) or a short distance from the nozzle. With radial injection of powders the heating and dispersion of the 
injected reactant is strongly dependent on the trajectory of the reactant into the 
plasma flame jet. For powders these trajectories are determined by particle size, 
density, injection velocity and morphology and the range of trajectories is 
dependent on, among other variables, the size distribution of the powders being 
injection. Axial injection of reactants has been used in thermal spray torches, 
see for example the supersonic velocity flame spray torch of Metco Diamond 
Jet, however, these spray torches are limited to reactants having low melting 
points (generally below about 1600Â°C) and have not been able to spray higher 
melting point materials.  
 It is also known from WO-A-9 015 516 and EP-A-0 368 547 for 
the arcs from separate cathodes to travel together, in the form 
of a common arc, along a significant portion of their travel 
before discharging to the anode. Further, in these torches, 
feed material is introduced directly into the combined arc. It is an aim of the present invention to provide an improved 
plasma jet torch permitting more uniform heat application, 
especially to particulate reactants. With this aim in mind, the 
invention starts from WO-A-9 015 516 and EP-A-0 368 547 mentioned 
above - on which the preamble of claim 1 is based - and achieves 
the desired improvement by the features set forth in the 
characterising part of claim 1. Preferred features of the invention are described in the 
subsidiary claims. As will be seen, the invention ensures that the plasma arcs 
are each fully contained in a separate arc-forming chamber and 
the gases leaving these chambers at a high termperature are 
symmetrically and uniformly impinged on a central stream of

<CLAIMS>
A plasma torch (10) having a longitudinal axis (16) with a 
plurality of electrodes (18) arranged about the longitudinal axis 

(16) to generate heated gases that are converged towards the 
longitudinal axis (16) and with a reactant feed passage (44), 

along the axis (16), opening into a region of convergence (38) 
of the gases, 
characterised in that
: 

(a) a plurality of independent arc-forming chambers (14) 
are arranged symmetrically about the axis (16) with 

each chamber (14) having a cathode (18) and a common 
anode (32) co-operating with the cathode (18) in each 

of the chambers (14) to form an arc in each of the 
chambers (14); 
(b) a plasma passage (36) through the common electrode 
(32) opens into each of the chambers (14) with each of 

the plasma passages (36) leading from its respective 
chamber (14) and converging towards each other in the 

region of convergence (38) into a single plasma nozzle 
passage (40) extending along the axis (16); and 
(c) the reactant feed passage (44) opens axially into an 
end of the nozzle passage (40) in the region of 

convergence (38) so as to inject reactant 
substantially axially into the plasma nozzle passage 

(40) and in the direction of travel of a plasma jet 
formed in the plasma nozzle passage (40) by combining 

plasma passing from the chambers (14) through the 
plasma passages (36) into the plasma nozzle passage

A torch as defined in claim 1 having magnetic shielding 
means (24) encircling each arc-forming chamber (14). 
A torch as defined in claim 1 or claim 2 having electrical 
insulating means (22) for each chamber (14) tending to prevent 

arcing from the first arc-forming electrode (18) to an adjacent 
wall of its respective chamber.  

 
A torch as defined in any one of claims 1-3, wherein each 
chamber (14) has its longitudinal axis substantially parallel to 

the longitudinal axis (16). 
A torch as defined in any one of claims 1-4 having cooling 
passages (28) to cool the chambers (14) and the passages (36). 
A torch as defined in any one of claims 1-5 having means 
(56) to simultaneously move all of the first arc-forming 

electrodes (18) relatively to the common electrode (32). 
A torch as defined in any one of claims 1-6 having means 
(64) to individually adjust each first arc-forming electrode (18) 

relatively to the common electrode (32). 
A torch as defined in claim 7 having means (72A, 72B, 72C) 
to individually adjust the electrical power to each first arc-forming 

electrode (18). 
A torch as defined in any one of claims 1 to 8 having three 
electrodes (18).
