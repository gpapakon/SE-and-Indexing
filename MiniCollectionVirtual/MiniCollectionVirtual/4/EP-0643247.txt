<ABSTRACT>
There is described a pipe-clamping collar of the 
releasable type consisting in a known way of two 

opposing half-collars whose flat ends are provided with 
holes through which pass two clamp screws, but improved 

by the arrangement that one of the two half-collars (1) 
has one of the two holes (10) laterally open outwards 

and the clamp screw (4) passing through said hole has a 
narrowing (11) at the terminal zone of the threaded 

shank thereof (12), whereby the diameter of the shank in 
said narrowing (11) is so reduced to allow the lateral 

inclination of the screw (4) and its coming out of the 
laterally open hole (10) of the half-collar (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pipe-clamping 
collar, and in particular to a collar wherein one of the 
two half-collars composing it can be released from the 
other without completely unscrewing either clamp screw. As known, the pipe-clamping collars essentially 
consist of two opposing half-collars connected by two 
clamp screws. Each half-collar consists of a metal clip 
arched in the middle and having both flat ends provided 
with a threaded hole through which passes each of the 
two clamp screws. The pipe is clamped by placing it 
between said half-collars and then by tightly screwing 
the clamp screws. In order to place the pipe between 
said half-collars, it is necessary to completely unscrew 
at least one of the two clamp screws so as to allow the 
rotation of a half-collar with respect to the other to 
let the pipe pass through. However, the complete 
unscrewing of one of the two screws involves the risk 
that such a screw falls and gets even lost during the 
installation. In order to eliminate such drawback there has 
already been proposed a type of collar wherein at least 
a threaded hole of one of the two half-collars is turned 
into a transversal slit which allows the head of the  
 
clamp screw to pass through and therefore the half-collar 
to be released. However, such a solution is not 
free from drawbacks because the transversal slit does 
not allow the use of narrow metal clips; in fact, the 
clip has to be wide enough to make the transversal slit 
thereon. Another type of known releasable collar allows 
the use of narrow clips because of the axial slit, but 
even this solution is not free from drawbacks because it 
involves, since all the holes are not threaded, the use 
of additional parts for the threadings with a resulting 
increase of material and manufacturing costs. Object of the present invention is to provide a 
pipe-clamping collar free from the above mentioned 
drawbacks of the so far known collars. Such object is 
attained by means of a collar wherein one of the two 
half-collars has one of the two holes laterally open 
outwards and wherein the screw passing through the said 
hole has, close to its end opposite to the head, a 
narrowing or diameter reduction apt to allow a lateral 
inclination of the screw enough to let it come out of 
the said laterally open hole and to consequently release 
the relating half-collar. The features and the advantages of the collar 
according to the present invention will appear evident 
to those skilled in the art from the following

<CLAIMS>
Pipe-clamping collar consisting of two 
opposing arched half-collars (1,2) whose flat ends are 

provided with holes through which pass two clamp screws, 
characterised in that one of the two arched half-collars 

(1) has one of the two holes (10) laterally open 
outwards and the clamp screw (4) passing through said 

hole has a narrowing (11) at the terminal zone of the 
threaded shank thereof (12), whereby the diameter of 

narrowing (11) is so reduced to allow the lateral 
inclination of screw (4) and its coming out of the 

laterally open hole (10) of the arched half-collar(1). 
Collar according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the other hole (9) of the arched half-collar (1) is 

shaped in the form of an axial slit.
