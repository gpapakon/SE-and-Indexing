<ABSTRACT>
A valve (1) for a motor vehicle tyre has a system (20) for generating a pressure loss signal for non-wired transmission. Said signal generation system comprises a pressure measurement system which in turn consists of: a) an absolute-pressure sensor (23), which is actuated by the tyre pressure and produces an electric signal corresponding to the tyre pressure; b) an electronic memory (27), in which a selected electrical pressure signal or a signal derived therefrom can be permanently stored; c) a microprocessor (26) with an arithmetical unit which compares a newly-generated electrical pressure signal with the selected pressure signal stored, produces a comparison signal, determines the ratio of the comparison signal to a preset threshold value, and triggers the activation of the transmitter (30, 31) if a preset deviation between the threshold value and the comparison signal is exceeded or not achieved; d) an activation system (18, 25) which, when operated, triggers the generation and storage of the selected electric pressure signal.
