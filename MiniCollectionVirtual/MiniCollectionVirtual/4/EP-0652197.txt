<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the synthesis of at least one alkyl tert-butyl ether, preferably MTBE or ETBE respectively, from at least one alcohol and from isobutene, which are synthesized at least partially from natural gas. The synthesis of alcohol, preferably methanol or ethanol respectively, is carried out at least partially from synthesis gas, the said synthesis gas being partly prepared in a region for the prereforming of natural gas with steam, and the synthesis of isobutene is carried out by means of a process sequence comprising, inter alia, the direct conversion of natural gas to ethylene, commonly known as methane oxidation (oxidative) coupling (M.O.C.), the dimerisation of ethylene to normal butene and the isomerisation of n-butene to isobutene, and to the associated separation units.

A process for the production of at least one alkyl
tertiobutyl ether at least partially from natural

gas, said process comprising the following steps:

(a) steam prereforming a feedstock containing mainly
natural gas in a prereforming zone in the presence

of a contact mass to produce an effluent containing
mainly hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide,
(b) mixing a major portion of the effluent from
prereforming step (a) (7) with a major portion of the

second effluent from the OCM zone described in step
(d) below, which has been dried and compressed,
(c) sending the mixture formed in step (b) to a
separation zone [(10) to (21)]
 to produce the following effluents:

a first fraction containing mainly carbon
dioxide,
a second fraction containing mainly methane,
a third fraction containing mainly ethylene,
a fourth fraction containing mainly hydrogen
and carbon monoxide,
a fifth fraction containing mainly ethane and
C
3
+
 hydrocarbons,
(d) carrying out oxidative coupling of methane(OCM) (6) in
an OCM zone to produce a first effluent (23) containing 

mainly ethylene, and a second effluent containing
mainly hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide,
(e) dimerising a major portion of the first effluent
obtained from step (d) in a dimerisation zone (29) to

produce an effluent containing mainly n-butene,
(f) isomerising a major portion of the effluent obtained
from step (e) in an isomerisation zone (32) to produce an

effluent containing mainly isobutene,
(g) synthesizing at least one alcohol in an alcohol
synthesis zone (34), from a portion of the fourth

fraction obtained from step (c) and a portion of the
first fraction obtained from step (c), said portions

being compressed before their introduction into the
alcohol synthesis zone to form an effluent

containing at least one alcohol,
(h) combining a major portion of the effluent obtained
in step (f) with at least a portion of the effluent

obtained in step (g) to synthesize at least one
alkyl tertiobutyl ether in an alkyl tertiobutyl

ether synthesis zone (37).
Process according to claim 1 wherein, prior to
prereforming, said feedstock is separated into a

first fraction containing mainly methane which
constitutes the actual feedstock for step (a), and a 

second fraction containing mainly hydrocarbons
containing at least two carbon atoms per molecule.
Process according to claim 2, wherein said
separation is carried out in the separation zone

described in step (c).
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein the supply to the OCM zone is constituted by

at least a portion of the second fraction described
in step (c).
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4
wherein the OCM zone is constituted by the section

of the oxypyrolysis zone in which the OCM is carried
out.
Process according to claim 5 wherein the section of
the oxypyrolysis zone in which pyrolysis is carried

out is supplied by the fifth fraction described in
step (c).
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 6
wherein a compressed portion of the second effluent 

obtained from step (d) is introduced into the
alcohol synthesis zone.

7 for the synthesis of methyl tertiobutyl ether.
Use of a process according to any one of claims 1 to

following steps:


(1) a major portion of the second effluent from the OCM

zone described in step (2) is dried and compressed
then sent to a separation zone to produce the

following effluents:

a first fraction containing mainly carbon

a second fraction containing mainly methane,
a third fraction containing mainly ethylene,
a fourth fraction containing mainly hydrogen
and carbon monoxide,
a fifth fraction containing mainly ethane and

(2) oxidative coupling of methane is carried out in an
OCM zone to produce a first effluent containing

mainly ethylene and a second effluent containing
mainly hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide,
(3) a portion of the first effluent obtained from step
(2) is dimerised in a dimerisation zone to produce

an effluent containing mainly n-butene,
(4) a major portion of the effluent obtained from step
