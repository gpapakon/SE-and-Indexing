<ABSTRACT>
A transport pallet (10) made of plastics has two parallel surfaces which form its top side (16a) and its bottom side (16) and whose outer side forms the base (15, 17) of two base bodies (12, 14) permanently fixed to each other and whose bases (15, 17) are mutually spaced apart. The base of each base body is a closed plate. The gap between the bases of the base bodies is bridged by pairs of parallel bars (20, 22; 22, 24; 24, 20) which enclose an intermediate groove. At both ends of each pair of bars the groove (26) is closed into a chamber by a cross-bar (28) which links both bases (15, 17). The space between the bases is closed around the periphery of the pallet by marginal bars (20). The pallet (10) is provided with feet (42) which project outwardly over a surface (16) and which optionally carry runners. Both base bodies (12, 14) are tightly linked to each other in the area of the bars (20, 22, 24) and cross-bars (28).

Transport pallet (10) produced of synthetic material with
two parallel surfaces respectively forming its upper side

(16a) and its underside (16), wherein

each surface (16, 16a) is the outward side of the base
(15, 17) of a respective one of two base bodies (12,

14), which are durably connected together and the bases
(15, 17) of which are arranged at a spacing one from the

other,
the base (15, 17) of each base body (12, 14) is a closed
plate,
the intermediate space between the bases (15, 17) of the
base bodies (12, 14) is bridged over by at least one

group of pairs of strips (20, 22; 22, 24; 24, 20) including
a groove (26) between them, all strips being

arranged one parallelly to the other,
the groove (26) is closed at each of both ends of each
pair of strips (20, 22; 22, 24; 24, 20) by a respective

transverse web (28) connecting both the bases (15, 17)
into a closed chamber extending over the entire width of

the pallet,
the strips (20, 22; 22, 24; 24, 20) and the transverse
webs (28) are integrally moulded on at both bases (15,

17), and
both the base bodies (12, 14) are tightly welded together
in the region of the strips (20, 22, 24) and the

transverse webs (28),

characterized thereby,
that the space between the bases (15, 17) along the
periphery of the pallet (10) is closed by rim strips

(20),
that the pallet is provided with feet (40) projecting
outwardly beyond one surface, wherein the closed plates 

can display apertures in the region of the feet in order
to enable an interengaging stacking of several pallets,
that a rigid re-inforcing insert (30) is laid into at
least one groove (26),
that the strips (22, 24; 22a, 24a), transverse webs (28;
28a) and rim strips (20; 20a), which are moulded on at

both the base bodies (12, 14) of the pallet (10), are
mutually congruently associated,
wherein the height of the strips (22, 24), the transverse
webs (28) and the rim strips (20) of the one base

body (12) corresponds approximately with the spacing of
the bases (15, 17) of both the base bodies (12, 14)

forming the pallet (10),
whilst the height of the strips (22a, 24a), the transverse
webs (28a) and the rim strips (20a) of the other

base body (14) is restricted to the height of weld
projections.
Pallet according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that
the base body (12), which carries the strips (22a, 24a),

the transverse webs (28a) and the rim strips (20a) with
the height of about the base spacing of the base bodies

(12, 14), is provided with the feet (40).
Pallet according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby,
that it comprises two groups of pairs of mutually parallel

strips, wherein the direction of the strips (22, 24) of
the one group intersects the direction of the strips (22',

24') of the other group, and that the strips are interrupted
in the region of intersection of each pair of

strips of the one group with a pair of strips of the other
group in such a manner that the grooves (26; 26'), which

are included by all pairs of strips, stand in communication
one with the other. 
Pallet according to claim 3, characterised thereby, that a
grating-like, rigid re-inforcing insert is laid into the

grooves.
Pallet according to claim 3 or 4, characterised thereby,
that the strips of at least one group extend parallelly to

a rim of the pallet (10).
Pallet according to one of the preceding claims, characterised
thereby, that the feet (40) are formed as hollow

bodies and arranged in a region kept clear of the pair of
strips (22, 24; 22', 24'), that their cross-section steadily

narrows in the direction of their free ends, that
that surface (16a) of the pallet (10), which is remote

from the feet, opposite each of the feet (40) displays an
aperture (52) suitable for the insertion of a foot (40),

that the cavity (54) enclosed by the feet opens in the
direction of this aperture (52) and that the region between

the aperture (52) and the base body (12) carrying the
foot (40) is surrounded by a wall, which closely adjoins

both the bases (15, 17) and the inward wall surface (50)
of which passes over in alignment into the inward wall

surface (44) of the foot (40).
Pallet according to one of the preceding claims, characterised
thereby, that the free ends (46) of the feet (40)

and skids (60, 61), which are matched to the spacing of
two feet (40) to be bridged over by a respective skid, are

pallet (10) can be provided underneath the feet (40) with
at least two mutually parallel skids (60, 61). 
Pallet according to claim 7, characterised thereby, that
the skids (61) consist of a downwardly open, trough-like

upper part (70) connected with the feet (40) and a lower
part (76), which covers the opening thereof and is tightly

connected therewith for the formation of a hollow body.
Pallet according to claim 8, characterised thereby, that
the upper part (70) is chamfered at its longitudinal edges

given case, with the longitudinal ribs (74) thereof.
Pallet according to one of the claims 10 or 11, characterised
thereby, that at least one of the skid chambers

contains a rigid reinforcing insert.
