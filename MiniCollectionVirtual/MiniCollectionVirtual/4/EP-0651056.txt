<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an acetyltransferase activity 
measuring agent which contains an arylamine derivative. 

As the arylamine derivative, sodium p-aminohippurate 
can be used preferably. Use of the acetyltransferase 

activity measuring agent of this invention permits a 
simple and safe diagnosis of the progress of the 

pathema of nephritis, which is accompanied by a 
mesangial proliferative lesion, or renal insufficiency. 

Furthermore, the scattering of measured values is 
small, thereby assuring an accurate diagnosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an acetyltransferase 
activity measuring agent which comprises an arylamine 
derivative. Tests of renal excretory function by measuring 
clearance are conventionally known as renal function 
tests. As one of these tests, creatinine clearance 
which makes use of creatinine as an endogenous substance 
is often used clinically to test the physical 
function in terms of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 
In the renal function test by measuring creatinine 
clearance, however, urine required for the test is 
preferably collected over 24 hours. The renal function 
test by creatinine clearance is therefore accompanied 
by the drawbacks that a substantial time is needed until 
test results are obtained, the test tends to be affected 
by the quantity of urine, body movements and the 
like, and measured values are prone to scattering. Further, to check the renal plasma flow (RPF), 
one of parameters of physical function of the kidneys, 
PAH clearance using p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) is also  
 
employed. Although PAH has the merits that it has 
safety to the human body and can be promptly excreted 
into urine when administered by intravenous infusion, 
PAH involves the problems that it is laborious and inflicts 
pain on subjects because upon conducting a test, 
continuous intravenous infusion is performed and a 
catheter is inserted into the bladder to collect urine 
at predetermined time points. Incidentally, many of nephritides which cause 
lowering in renal function are mesangial proliferative, 
typified by immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephritis. 
Nephritis having a mesangial proliferative lesion is 
progressive and has high possibility of resulting in 
renal insufficiency and the need for dialysis. To 
determine and diagnose such nephritis, histopathological 
findings of kidney tissue obtained by biopsy are 
indispensable. Kidney biopsy and such histopathological 
findings, however, can be conducted only at a hospital 
equipped with facilities therefor. To conduct 
kidney biopsy, a subject has to be hospitalized. Moreover, 
there is the potential risk that upon biopsy, one 
or more blood vessels may be damaged or the subject may 
be affected by an infectious disease. On the other hand, N-acetylation of an aromatic 
amine in the human body is a reaction in which acetyltransferase,  
 
an enzyme in the body, takes part. It has 
been reported that acetyltransferase activity is observed 
on excised organs such as kidneys and livers and 
also on white blood cells [G.M. Pacifici et al.,
