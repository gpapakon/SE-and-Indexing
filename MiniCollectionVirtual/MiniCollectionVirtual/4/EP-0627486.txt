<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new extracellular superoxide dismutase, a process 
for preparing the same, and compositions containing the same. The technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide a new 
extracellular superoxide dismutase which shows the ability to dismutate reactive oxygen 
intermediates produced by activated human neutrophils. Superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), which represents one of the main defense 
enzymes against toxic oxygen species, was originally described by McCord & Fridovich 
(1969) and occurs in several forms. Inside the eukaryotic cell a Cu²⁺-Zn²⁺ enzyme is 
found in the cytosol and a Mn²⁺-enzyme is located in mitochondria (for a review see 
Bannister et al., 1987). Both enzymes are conserved throughout evolution. More recently 
Marklund and coworkers have shown that also several extracellular forms of SOD (referred 
to as EC-SOD) exist in plasma of human and other mammalian species (Marklund et al., 
1982; Hjalmarsson et al., 1987; Tibell et al., 1987). These extracellular forms can be 
divided into three classes namely A, B and C according to their increasing affinity for 
heparin (Marklund, 1984; Karlsson & Marklund, 1987; Karlsson & Marklund, 1988). Until now only the human extracellular SOD C (EC-SOD C) was completely purified, 
sequenced, cloned and expressed. Many patent applications and specifications have delt 
with these applications (f.i. EP-A-0 492 447, EP-B-0 236 385). This EC-SOD C avidly binds to anchorage-dependent cell lines but has almost no 
affinity for blood cells, including neutrophils Karlsson & Marklund, 1989). In the body, 
the major portion of EC-SOD C binds to heparin sulfate proteoglycan in the glycocalyx of 
cell surfaces and in the connective tissue forming an equilibrium with the extracellular fluid 
phase. EC-SOD C is known to bind to endothelial cell surfaces and most likely also to 
surfaces of other cell types, whereas EC-SOD of the subtypes A and B have been proposed 
to exist mainly in the extracellular fluid phase (Adachi & Marklund, 1989; Karlsson & 
Marklund, 1988). According to Hjalmarsson et al. (1987) the binding of EC-SOD C to sulfated 
proteoglycan and heparin is due to a hydrophilic C-terminal sequence containing 6 arginine 
and 3 lysine residues in the last 21 amino acids. The C form is absent in rat and therefore, 
in this species the B form is the only EC-SOD that is able to bind to heparin (Karlsson & 
Marklund, 1988). It has been suggested that A and B forms are derived from the C form by 
post-tr
