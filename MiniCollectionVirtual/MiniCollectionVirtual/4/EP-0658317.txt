Rod-like smoking product having a strand-shaped core of chopped
smoking tobacco, which is surrounded by a jacket of one or more layers of

tobacco sheets produced according to a paper manufacturing process from
tobacco cellulose, tobacco extract, foreign cellulose and conventional

additives, wherein the outermost layer is wound around the smoking
product spirally at an acute angle to the longitudinal axis of the smoking

product as a strip-like-cover sheet and is at least partly adhered, and at
least one of these layers enveloping the core is an axially adhered tobacco

sheet, which is composed as follows:

a) 75 to 100 % by weight components peculiar to tobacco substantially
consisting of tobacco cellulose and tobacco extract, which were obtained

both from a cut tobacco mixture and from tobacco rib material;
b) 0 to 20 % wt. foreign cellulose and
c) 0 to 15 % wt. conventional additives such as binders, fillers, agents
modifying combustion, and aroma materials,

characterised in that
d) the tobacco cellulose originates from a cut tobacco mixture and tobacco rib
material in the ratio of 1:1.1 to 1:5, and
e) the tobacco extract is present in a quantity of more than 20 % wt. relative
to the dry substance of the tobacco sheet,
f) the tobacco extract was obtained from a chopped lamina of leaf tobacco
mixture and from tobacco rib material in the ratio by mass of 1:5.
Smoking product according to claim 1, characterised in that in the tobacco

sheet (TF-1) the mixture ratio of chopped leaf tobacco mixture or tobacco
fines to tobacco rib material is in the range from 1:1.5 to 1:2.5. 
Smoking product according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
chopped leaf tobacco mixture or tobacco fines, from which the tobacco

sheet (TF-1) was obtained contains

30 to 40 5 wt. Virginia tobacco
35 to 55 5 wt. Burley tobacco
5 to 10 % wt. Orient tobacco and
1 to 10 % wt. swelling ribs of Virginia tobacco

with a particle size of at least 1.75 mm.
Smoking product according to claim 1 to 3, characterised in that the
tobacco rib material from which the tobacco sheet (TF-1) was obtained

consists predominantly of heat-treated Virginia tobacco ribs with a length
of about 30 mm.
Smoking product according to claim 1 to 4, characterised in that in the
manufacture of the tobacco sheet (TF-1) the tobacco extract was applied

in a quantity of more than 20 % wt. relative to the dry substance of the
tobacco sheet.
Smoking product according to claim 5, characterised in that the tobacco
extract consists of


a) an extract obtained at a relatively high temperature from chopped leaf
tobacco and tobacco rib material,
b) of an extract obtained at a relatively high temperature from tobacco rib
material,
c) very volatile extracted aroma substances which are water-soluble and non-water
soluble.
Smoking product according to claim 1 to 6, characterised in that the
tobacco sheet (TF-1) contains up to 12 % wt. calcium carbonate and up to

2 % wt. sodium or potassium citrate or acetate. 
Smoking product according to claim 1 to 7, characterised in that a further
tobacco sheet (TF-2) of the jacket is provided, which relative to the dry

substance weight of the tobacco sheet consists of the following
components ground wet individually or at least partly together:


a) 75 to 80 % wt. leaf tobacco consisting substantially of lamina and
b) 10 to 20 % wt. long-fibre cellulose and
c) 0 to 15 % wt. conventional additives such as binders, fillers, agents
modifying combustion and aroma substances.
Smoking product according to claim 8, characterised in that the long-fibre
cellulose was obtained from manila, sisal, flax, hemp, soft wood or their

mixtures.
Smoking product according to claim 8 and 9, characterised in that the
tobacco sheet (TF-2) contains up to 12% wt. calcium carbonate and/or up

to 4 % wt. titanium dioxide and/or up to 2 % wt. sodium or potassium citrate
or acetate.
Smoking product according to claim 8 to 10, characterised in that the
tobacco sheet (TF-2) corresponds in its tobacco mixture composition

important for taste to the composition of the cut tobacco mixture of the
strand-like core.
Smoking product according to claim 7 to 11, characterised in that one of
the tobacco sheets of the jacket is provided as an external spirally wound

cover leaf sheet, and the other tobacco sheet as an axially adhered
surrounding leaf sheet.
Smoking product according to claim 1 to 12, characterised in that the
porosity of the jacket consisting of cover leaf and surrounding leaf is larger

than 30 and less than 1000 Coresta units and is capable of being smoked
on its own.

Smoking product according to claim 1 to 11, characterised in that the
porosity of the jacket consisting of the cover leaf and the surrounding leaf

is more than 10 000 Coresta units and is not capable of being smoked on
its own.
Use of a smoking product according to claim 16 as a cigarillo insertable in
a conventional filter cigarette sleeve.
Smoking product according to claim 1 to 13 and 16, characterised in that
the chopped smoking tobacco of the core has an average cut width of

about 2.2 mm.

least partially adhered in the form of a leaf with an axial overlap region, 

into which sheet the core of smoking tobacco enveloped by the inner
tobacco sheet is insertable.
