<ABSTRACT>
Polyketones can be formed in enhanced yield by conducting the polymerization of the carbon monoxide and olefin monomers used to form the polyketone in a gas phase polymerization process in the presence of a catalyst support which is substantially saturated with an amount of a liquid, non-polymerizable diluent, for example, an organic diluent, which is effective in increasing the amount of polyketone formed over that which would be formed in the substantial absence of the diluent. Preferably, the catalyst is supported on a high surface area polyketone support (e.g., a carbon monoxide-ethylene high surface area support). Hydrogen gas can be used to reduce the molecular weight and increase the bulk density and thermal stability of the polyketone product.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED GAS PHASE PROCESS FOR FORMING POLYKETONESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIt is known to form polyketones by the polymerization of carbon monoxide and one or more olefins by a vapor phase polymerization process. For example, U.S. Patent No.4,778,876 of M. J. Doyle et al. describes such a process in which the monomers are contacted with the catalyst compositions in the substantial absence of a liquid, non- polymerizable diluent. Any small quantity of diluent that might be present is vaporized and present in exclusively the gaseous state during the polymerization (Col. 3, lines 35- 40) . This teaching of having any added alcohol diluent present exclusively or substantially in the gaseous condition during the polymerization reaction is substantially echoed by other, more recent patent references: European PatentPublication No. 248,483 (see Col. 3, lines 8-13 and Claim 2). European Patent Publication No. 443,587 (see Col. 3, lines 3- 8 and Claim 2); and European Patent Publication No. 506,168 (see Col. 5, lines 29-35 and Claims 8-9) . Netherlands Patent Application No. 9101114, filed June27, 1991, and corresponding European Patent Publication No. 520,584 advocate a gas phase polymerization process for the manufacture of polyketones in which water is added to the polymerization reaction environment to enhance the polymerization activity of the polymerization process. The amount of water should range from more than one mole per grair. atom of Group VIII metal in the catalyst, preferably more than 10 moles, for example, from about 5,000 to about 50,000 moles per mole of Group VIII metal. The upper limit of water added is set by the requirement that gas should form the continuous phase in the reactor. The European patent citation exemplifies the add-on of 1 ml and 7 ml water, respectively, to 8 g of porous carbon monoxide/ethene 

copolymer catalyst support. The present investigators have determined that a carbon monoxide/ethene copolymer becomes saturated at far higher levels of water add-on than 7 ml, namely, at about 40-43 g. The productivity using 7 ml of water (an add-on of about 88%) was inferior to that observed when a far lower add-on (14% for 1 ml of water) was employed.SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a gas phase process for catalytically polymerizing carbon monoxide and at least one olefin to produce a polyketone. The particular improvement in the process of the present invention is conducting the polymerization in the presence of a catalyst support which is
