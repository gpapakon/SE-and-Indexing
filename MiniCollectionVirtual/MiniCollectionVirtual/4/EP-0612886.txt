<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bridge consisting of at least two bridge elements (10.1, 10.2). Each bridge element consists of a base body (11) with bevelled end faces (13), on which carriageway slabs (14) lie, it being possible for the carriageway slabs to be brought in constrained fashion from a run-up position into a coupling position by means of articulated ramp plates (17; 17.1, 17.2) by in each case two bridge elements being moved up against one another into a run-up position with the ramp plates. The device (18.1) for placing the bridge has a guide (supporting rail 21, holding plate 22) for the guide pins (17.3, 17.4) of the ramp plates (17.1, 17.2), so that the bridge elements (10.1, 10.2) can be securely brought together. In addition, the device (18.1) has guide rails (27), with which the locking elements (hooks 28, bolts 38) can be centrally actuated.

Bridge with at least one bridge element (10.1, 10.2) 
which has a bridge base unit (11) with sloping end 

faces (13) and road surface plates (14), which may be 
swung around an axis (15) disposed in the region of 

the upper edge of the sloping end faces (13),
 
wherein ramp plates (17) are articulated at the end of 

the road surface plates (14) opposite the swivel axis 
(15) and the road surface plates (14) either lie on 

the sloping end faces (13) to form a run-up location 
and the ramp plates (17) lie on the embankment, or the 

road surface plates (14) are swung away from the end 
faces (13) to connect two bridge elements (10.1, 10.2) 

to form a bridge and the ramp plates (17) are swung 
downwards into a substantially vertical position and 

the facing road surface plates (14) of the bridge 
elements (10.1, 10.2) to be coupled can be locked 

directly to one another and unlocked by means of a 
coupling hook (28), and wherein a bottom chord locking 

arrangement (37) is provided with which the bottom 
chords of the bridge elements (10.1, 10.2) to be 

coupled may be locked,
 
characterised in that the coupling hook (28) may be 

operated via a tension element (29) by a rotatable 
coupling shaft (30), and that the bottom chord locking 

arrangement (37) is connected to the road surface 
plate locking arrangement (28) via a joint operating 

arrangement. 
Bridge according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
articulation (16) between the road surface plates (14) 

and the ramp plates (17) is pre-stressed by means of a 
spring (16').  

 
Bridge according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
spring (16') is a torsion spring. 
Bridge according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the bottom chord locking 

arrangement (37) is constructed as a bolt coupling 
with bolts (38) disposed to be displaceable 

transversely to the bridge elements (10.1, 10.2), 
whereby in the locking position the bolts (38) engage 

into holes (41) of butt straps (42) or cheeks (43) of 
the bottom chords of the bridge elements. 
Bridge according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
joint operating arrangement has a coupling shaft (30), 

on which a disc cam (31) with guide grooves (32) is 
attached, into which a driving pin (33) connected to 

the tension element (29) for the road surface plate 
locking arrangement (28) engages and which is 

connected to a further disc cam (34) also provided 
with guide grooves (35) for the bolts (38) via a 

linkage (39). 
Bridge according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
guide grooves (32, 35) have an involute form. 
Bridge according to Claim 5 or 6, characterised in 
that the bolts (38) have pins (44) which are guided in 

a control groove (45) manipulated by the additional 
disc cam (34). 
Bridge according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that the coupling shaft (30) may be 

actuated by a coupling lever (25).  
 
Bridge according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
 
characterised in that pressure is applied to the 

bottom chord locking arrangement (37) by a spring (49) 
in the direction of locking. 
Bridge according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
 
characterised in that the ramp plates (17) can be 

fixed in the vertical position and are secured against 
lateral displacement. 
Bridge according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
 
characterised in that the adjoining road surface 

plates (14) of adjacent bridge elements (10.1, 10.2) 
are supported by the respective ramp plates (17) 

articulated there. 
Device for placing a bridge according to one of Claims 
1 to 11, characterised in that a coupling rail (27), 

which is adjustable in vertical direction, and may be 
manipulated by the joint operating arrangement via a 

coupling lever (25) of the coupling shaft (30) of the 
bridge, is arranged on said device to actuate the 

joint operating arrangement for the bottom chord 
locking arrangement (37) and road surface plate 

locking arrangement (28). 
Device according to Claim 12, characterised in that 
support rails (21) are provided on it on which the 

free ends of the ramp plates (17.1, 17.2) of two 
bridge elements (10.1, 10.2) may be guided while being 

moved towards one another. 
Device according to Claim 13, characterised by a guide 
means formed from the support rail (21) and a holding  

 
plate (22) arranged over it, into which lateral guide 

pins (17.3, 17.4) of the ramp plates (17.1, 17.2) can 
engage.
