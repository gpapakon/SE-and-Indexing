<ABSTRACT>
[SUMMARY]
[OBJECT] To provide a method for economical recovery of 

ethylene from ethylene-containing vent gas from a plant for 
production of ethylene oxide, wherein ethylene is separated 

from saturated hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane and oxygen 
and then recovered efficiently. 
[CONSTITUTION] The vent gas is made to contact with molecular 

sieve carbon to selectively adsorb ethylene without 
substantial adsorption of the oxygen contained in the vent 

gas, the ethylene then being desorbed and recovered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
recovering ethylene from vent gas from a plant for production of 
ethylene oxide. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to a method for separating ethylene from saturated 
hydrocarbon such as methane, ethane and oxygen contained in the 
vent gas, by which the ethylene can be recovered efficiently. In the plants for producing ethylene oxide by 
oxidation of ethylene, the process gas obtained after recovering 
ethylene oxide from the effluent reaction gas contains a large 
amount of unreacted ethylene. Therefore, the process gas is re-circulated 
back into the reaction system in order to enhance the 
reaction efficiency of ethylene. The process gas also contains, besides the unreacted 
ethylene, saturated hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane, 
inert gases such as carbon dioxide, argon and nitrogen and 
oxygen. As a result of the repeated circulation of the gas into 
the reaction system, the inert gases, such as nitrogen and 
argon, are concentrated, and a part of the concentrates are 
continuously withdrawn out of the reaction system to be utilized 
as fuel gas. The vent gas, however, usually contains about 30% 
ethylene, and it is uneconomical to use the gas only as fuel  
 
gas. Therefore, in order to re-use the gas as raw material gas, 
various methods for recovering ethylene from the vent gas have 
been proposed wherein the vent gas is treated with silica gel or 
active carbon to adsorb the ethylene and then desorbing and 
recovering the ethylene therefrom (see, for example, Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-open Nos. 109117/1983, 174732/1985 and 
116721/1988). However, these methods have the following 
disadvantages: 
(i) As even methane, contained in the vent gas in a 
larger amount than ethylene, is adsorbed as well as ethylene, 
the amount of gas recovered by means of desorption is increased. 
Generally, in the re-circulation to the ethylene oxide-production 
plant, the recovered gas must be repressurized to the 
reaction pressure (normally 20 kg/cm2). From the industrial 
viewpoint, it is greatly uneconomical to pressurize the gas 
accompanying methane which is inert for the oxidation reaction.  (ii) The complete separation and removal of inert 
gases (e.g. argon, nitrogen, carbonic acid gas, etc.) contained 
in the vent gas surely causes loss of ethylene into the exhaust 
gas; whereas, the improvement of recovery efficiency of ethylene 
results in an increase in concentration of the inert gases such 
as argon in the recovered gas;
