<ABSTRACT>
A multi-band equalizer for receiving and processing 
an audio signal includes a plurality of operational 

amplifiers, each for processing a different frequency 
band of the audio signal to produce an output signal. 

Each operational amplifier includes an inverting input, 
a non-inverting input, a resistor means coupled to the 

non-inverting input for receiving the audio signal and 
supplying it to the non-inverting input, an output, a 

feedback circuit coupled between the output and the 
inverting input for determining the upper limits of the 

frequency band processed by that particular operational 
amplifier, and an input circuit coupled between the 

inverting input and ground potential for determining the 
lower limits of the frequency band processed by that 

operational amplifier. A summing circuit is coupled to 
the outputs of all of the operational amplifiers for 

combining the output signals thereof to produce a

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an equalizer circuit and 
more particularly to a gain and equalization circuit for 
use in reducing distortion and other anomalies, and 
improving "clarity" in a variety of currently available 
sound systems. Sound generation, recording and reproduction 
systems may take a variety of forms and perform a 
variety of functions, all relating, of course, to 
processing sound signals, with the common objective 
being to ultimately reproduce as accurately as possible 
the sound originally created or recorded or even 
"enhance" it. Such systems include, among others, 
public address systems and similar systems which utilize 
microphones and speakers, radio and television broadcast 
systems, radio and television receivers, tape recorders 
and disk recorders and players, home, auto and portable 
stereo systems, and recording studio systems. In all 
such systems, the sound is converted to electrical audio 
signals representing the sound, processed in some way, 
and then either reproduced, transmitted to other 
locations or recorded. At the various stages of 
generating the sound and processing the audio signals, 
there is a chance that either noise will be introduced 
to mask the true signals or the signals will be 
distorted (undesired change in signal waveform) in such 
a way that it is difficult to accurately reproduce the  
 
sound. Such noise and/or distortion may arise in the 
sound source itself, for example, instruments, voices, 
etc., in the room or studio acoustic configuration, in 
microphones which pick up the sound and convert it to 
electrical audio signals, in audio amplifiers and other 
audio signal processing components, in recording 
equipment and recording media, in speaker systems, and 
in audio signal transmitting equipment. Ideally, all noise would be removed from (or not 
allowed to initially influence) the audio signal, and 
all processing of the audio signal would take place free 
from distortion, e.g., amplification would occur equally 
and uniformly over the entire audio signal frequency 
band (audio spectrum). However, achieving an 
essentially undistorted resultant audio signal has not 
been possible; rather in the course of reproducing an 
audio signal and otherwise processing such a signal, 
distortion of some form (phase distortion, frequency 
distortion, harmonic distortion, intermodulation 
distortion and the addition of noise) is inevitably 
introduced. Distortion, which is frequency dependent, 
means that the signal being processed is treated 
different
