<ABSTRACT>
A pipeline plug is disclosed wherein the rear portion of the plug is axially movable relative to the body of the plug and is provided with pipeline engaging drag inducing members (18, 85). While the plug is propelled by the pipeline fluid flow, the dragging effect maintains the rear portion at its rearmost extreme. When the plug reaches its determined position in the pipeline (16), the reversal of flow in the pipeline (16) is resisted by the drag means (18, 85) with the resulting shift of the rear portion forwardly of the plug, triggering the locking of the plug in place and subsequent expansion of the seals (54, 102) of the plug, all caused solely by the pressure differential generated in the pipeline (16) to be worked upon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of pipeline pigs or pipeline packers. 
Pipeline pigs are used in isolating a predetermined section of a pipeline from the 
fluid of the pipeline in order to enable repairs, connecting or other maintenance 
or installation tasks which cannot be done while the medium flows through the 
respective pipeline. Various types of pipeline pigs are known in the art. One of the required 
features of the pipelines is that they be provided with suitable gripping means 
which would firmly engage the inside wall of a pipeline. To this end, a number 
of different mechanisms is known utilizing hydraulic power combined with a 
toggle mechanism and many other ways of securing a firm engagement. 
Viewed from the standpoint of the present invention, the known pipeline pigs 
are of complex structure and require additional sources of power for achieving 
different operational states. Attempts are known to have been made to provide pigs or the like 
devices which would not require external sources of power. As far as the 
applicant knows, the arrangement of US-A-3 107 696 is closest to the subject 
matter. It provides a pig which can be transported to a predetermined location 
in a pipeline to be repaired or the like. This is achieved by controlling the fluid 
pressure upstream and downstream of the pig. In particular, the device requires 
a predetermined minimum pressure acting at annular bellows. The pressure is 
utilized to overcome a compression spring pressure which acts at locking dogs 
used to engage the inner wall of the pipeline to generally lockingly immobilize 
the pig within the pipeline. When the pig arrives at the desired location, the 
pressure at the bellows is reduced to a predetermined minimum. As a result, 
the compression of the spring is no longer overcome and it expands the dogs 
into engagement with the pipeline.  
 While the device presents advantage of nor requiring an external source 
of power to activate the locking of the pig, it suffers from the drawback that 
- in order to be operable - certain pressure conditions have to be met 
upstream and downstream of the pig which go beyond a mere pressure 
differential required to manipulate the movement of the pig in the pipeline. For instance, at the outset, it must be very difficult, if not impossible, 
to provide sufficient pressure to allow the introduction of the pig into the 
pipeline. At zero pressure at the trailing end of the pig, the dogs expand and 
do not allow introduction of the pig into the pipeline. Certain
