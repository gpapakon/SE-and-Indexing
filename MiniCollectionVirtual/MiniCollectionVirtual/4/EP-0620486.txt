<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed of obtaining from an 
imagewise exposed photographic element separate records 

of the imagewise exposure to each of the blue, green 
and red portions of the spectrum comprising 

photographically processing an imagewise exposed 
photographic element comprised of a sequence of 

superimposed blue, green and red recording silver 
halide emulsion layer units that produce images of 

substantially the same hue upon processing. A first 

interlayer overlies the emulsion layer unit nearest the 
support for transmitting to it imagewise exposing 

radiation this emulsion layer unit is intended to 
record and for absorbing after photographic processing 

scanning radiation within at least one wavelength 
region. A second interlayer underlies the emulsion 

layer unit farthest from the support for transmitting 
to the underlying emulsion layer units exposing 

radiation they are intended to record and for absorbing 
after photographic processing scanning radiation within 

at least one wavelength region. The imagewise exposed 
photographic element is photographically processed to 

produce a reflective image in each of the emulsion 
layer units and is reflection scanned utilizing the 

absorption of the first and second interlayers to 
provide the image information in two of the emulsion 

layer units. The photographic element is scanned 
through the interlayers and all of the emulsion layer  

 
units to provide a spectrally undifferentiated third 

record of the combined images in all of the emulsion 
layer units. The first, second and third records are 

compared to obtain separate blue, green and red 
exposure records. In the photographic elements of the 

invention the interlayers remain or become light 
absorbing after photographic processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a method of 
extracting blue, green and red exposure records from an 
imagewise exposed silver halide photographic element 
and to a photographic element particularly adapted for 
use in the method. In classical black-and-white photography a 
photographic element containing a silver halide 
emulsion layer coated on a transparent film support is 
imagewise exposed to light, producing a latent image 
within the emulsion layer. The film is then 
photographically processed to transform the latent 
image into a silver image that is a negative image of 
the subject photographed. Photographic processing 
involves developing (reducing silver halide grains 
containing latent image sites to silver), stopping 
development, and fixing (dissolving undeveloped silver 
halide grains). The resulting processed photographic 
element, commonly referred to as a negative, is placed 
between a uniform exposure light source and a second 
photographic element, commonly referred to as a 
photographic paper, containing a silver halide emulsion 
layer coated on a white paper support. Exposure of the 
emulsion layer of the photographic paper through the 
negative produces a latent image in the photographic 
paper that is a positive image of the subject 
originally photographed. Photographic processing of 
the photographic paper produces a positive silver  
 
image. The image bearing photographic paper is 
commonly referred to as a print. In classical color photography in its most 
widely used form the photographic film contains three 
superimposed silver halide emulsion layer units each 
containing a different subtractive primary dye or dye 
precursor, one for recording blue light (i.e., blue) 
exposure and forming a yellow dye image, one for 
recording green exposure and forming a magenta dye 
image, and one for recording red exposure and forming a 
cyan dye image. During photographic processing 
developing agent is oxidized in the course of reducing 
latent image containing silver halide grains to silver, 
and the oxidized developing agent is employed to form 
the dye image, usually by reacting (coupling) with a 
dye precursor (a dye-forming coupler). Undeveloped 
silver halide is removed by fixing and the unwanted 
developed silver image is removed by bleaching during 
photographic processing. This approach is most 
commonly used to produce negative dye images (i.e., 
blue, green and red subject features appear yellow, 
magenta and cyan, respectively) . Exposure of color 
paper through the color
