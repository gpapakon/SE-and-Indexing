<ABSTRACT>
In a projection television system, a blue phosphor roll-off 
compensation network (QB,RB,RE2A,RE2B,RE3,VBIAS) is 

included in the emitter circuit of a common emitter configured 
transistor (QD) comprising the driver amplifier for the blue 

cathode ray tube. The roll-off compensation network includes a 
voltage divider (RE2A,RE2B) connected between the emitter of the 

common emitter configured transistor (QD) and a source of a bias 
voltage (VBIAS), and a second transistor (QB) having its base 

connected to a point within the voltage divider and its collector-emitter 
path connected in series with a gain changing resistor (RB) 

between the emitter of the common emitter configured transistor 
and the source of the variable bias voltage (VBIAS). The voltage 

divider determines the level of drive current at which the second 
transistor is rendered conductive and thereby the point at which 

roll-off compensation is applied. The gain changing resistor 
determines the amount of compensation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an arrangement which may be 
used to compensate for the so called blue phosphor "roll-off" 
characteristic of a cathode ray tube as may be employed in a 
projection television system. A projection television system 
includes three individual cathode ray tubes (CRTs), each having a 
different screen phosphor corresponding to one of red, green or 
blue colors. Relatively high level red, green and blue video drive 
signals are coupled to respective electron guns of the CRTs from 
respective drive amplifiers or "drivers" which amplify respective 
relatively low level red, green and blue video signals produced by 
a signal processing section. Usually, the video drive signals are 
coupled to the cathodes of the CRTs. In response to the respective 
video drive signals, the CRTs generate an electron beams which 
strike the respective screen phosphors causing them to emit light 
outputs of particular wavelengths corresponding to respective 
colors. The light outputs produced the CRTs are transmitted by an 
optical system to a screen where a composite color image is 
reproduced. The intensity of the light produced by a CRT is a 
function of the intensity of the electron beam, which in turn, is a 
function of the magnitude of the drive signal coupled to electron 
gun. When a the magnitude of a video signal coupled to a driver 
is high, it is expected that a corresponding high intensity light 
output will be produced by the CRT. However, the efficiency of a 
phosphor to convert beam current to light may be reduced or 
"roll-off" as the magnitude of the drive signal increases. This is 
particularly a problem with the blue phosphor. More specifically, 
the blue phosphor becomes less efficient than the green and red 
phosphors as the CRTs are driven increasingly hard. This 
nonuniformity is due to the doping required to get the blue 
phosphor compound to emit light at the desired wavelength. The problem of the blue phosphor inefficiency or roll-off 
is manifested in two ways. The first relates to "white balance" 
or grey scale retention, and the second relates to color fidelity.  Considering the case of white balance first, it is very 
desirable for a color television system to maintain constant white 
balance or grey scale. When "white" representative red, green 
and blue video signals are coupled to the image reproducing 
device, it should produce a "white" image. White comes in a 
variety of tints. For example, the "white" light produced by an 
incandescent light bulb is visibly more yellow
