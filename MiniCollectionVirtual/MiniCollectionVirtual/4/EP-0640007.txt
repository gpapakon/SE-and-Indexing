<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydrophilic
microporous membrane, comprising a hydrophobic membrane
substrate exemplified by a polyolefin membrane or partially
fluorinated polyolefin membrane. The invention also
concerns a process for preparing a hydrophilic membrane by
grafting a water soluble polymer to the hydrophobic
membrane substrate surface by irradiation means, e.g.,
ultraviolet (i.e. UV) irradiation. The invention further
concerns a method for making the membrane and process means
for filtering a fluid through such membrane.The separation of particulates and
macromolecules from a fluid by micro-and ultra-filtration
using polymeric membranes has found numerous applications
in the analytical, pharmaceutical, electronic, and food
industries. Traditionally, porous membranes of cellulose
derivatives have been utilized as hydrophilic membrane
media for aqueous filtration. However, these membranes
have poor chemical resistance, and are also lacking in
thermal and gamma sterilizability, which limits their
application in practical service.To meet the requirements for chemical
filtration, porous membranes such as polypropylene and
polytetrafluoroethylene membranes were therefore developed.
These membranes generally have excellent chemical and
solvent resistance. However, one drawback associated with
these membranes is their hydrophobicity. For practical
aqueous filtration, these hydrophobic membranes must be
either pre-wetted with a low surface tension liquid such as 
alcohols, prior to use, or pre-treated with hydrophilic
chemicals to render the membrane hydrophilic as described
in US-A-4,578,414; 4,501,785 and 4,113,912 prior to
use. Upon use of these treated membranes, however, there
is a risk that the wetting agents may be leached from the
membrane by the solution being filtered. Such leaching in
turn may result in contamination of the filtrate.To impart permanent hydrophilicity to a
hydrophobic porous membrane, a hydrophilic monomer can be
chemically grafted to the hydrophobic membrane substrate by
plasma treatment. The plasma polymerization is generally
achieved by activating the membrane surface using argon or
hydrogen plasma, followed by exposing the activated
membrane to the vapor of free radical polymerizable
monomers such as acrylic acid. Typical examples of plasma
treatment of membrane can be found in US-A-4,815,132
and JP-A-59/045,528, 61/152,700 and 56/090,838.
In practice, the plasma treatment may fail to produce
uniform membrane hydrophilicity due to the low penetration
of plasma gas and
