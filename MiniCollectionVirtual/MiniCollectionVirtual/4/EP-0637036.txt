<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an integrated circuit memory having a 
plurality of addressable elements and a plurality of 

redundant elements for substitution of the addressable 
elements. A configurable selection circuit for each 

redundant element allows for associating the redundant 
element with an address for access of the redundant 

element in place of an addressable element, upon 
permanent physical modification of the integrated circuit 

memory. Redundant element testing is provided by use of 
bypass circuitry, responsive to a redundant element test 

signal. The bypass circuitry includes circuitry 
associated with each redundant element, for simulating 

access of the redundant element without modification of 
the configurable selection circuit for the redundant 

element. Each redundant element has an address, unique 
among the redundant elements but duplicating an address 

for a regular element, which is used for accessing the 
redundant element during testing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of integrated circuits 
containing memory arrays, and is more particularly 
directed to providing for evaluation of redundant 
elements in such circuits without programming the circuit 
to substitute those elements for regular elements. A manufacturer of integrated circuits may often 
reduce overall manufacturing costs of its product by 
reducing the rejection rate for defective individual 
parts. One way to reduce the rejection rate is through 
ever finer refinement of manufacturing processes. Such 
refinement, though, is subject to the laws of diminishing 
returns. For example, a given integrated circuit may 
contain several thousand individual electronic 
components, such as transistors, diodes and the like. It 
may prove relatively easy and inexpensive to reduce the 
probability of a particular integrated circuit having one 
or more defective components to a certain percentage but 
increasingly difficult or expensive to improve the 
rejection rate beyond that point. Still, the presence of 
only one or two defective components out of thousands of 
components on an integrated circuit will dictate the 
rejection of that integrated circuit and potentially 
thousands of other integrated circuits. Another solution to reducing the rejection rate, 
without expensive refinements of manufacturing processes, 
is to provide auxiliary, sometimes called redundant, 
circuit components on the integrated circuit. This 
solution is practical where testing can locate, within 
certain bounds, the defective component, and the circuit 
is readily reconfigurable to allow substitution of an  
 
auxiliary component for the defective component. 
Integrated circuit matrix memory arrays, including static 
random access memories (SRAM), are examples of such 
integrated circuits. In addition, many complex 
microprocessors now include significant amounts of on-chip 
memory, such as 64 kbytes or more of read-only 
memory and 64 kbytes or more of random access memory. Memory arrays are characterized by the regular 
repetition of components. A very substantial portion of 
an integrated memory array is taken up by substantially 
identical memory cells disposed in regular rows and 
columns. Decoding circuits are provided on the integrated 
circuit memory for operating on various combinations of 
electrical signals provided as inputs to the integrated 
circuit to generate signals within the integrated circuit 
for causing activation of a specific group of cells in 
the array. The decoder circuit generally
