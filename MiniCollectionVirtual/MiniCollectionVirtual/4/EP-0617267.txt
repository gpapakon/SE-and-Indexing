<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device comprises a piezoresistive pressure 
sensor (12), which has a membrane (14), which is constituted by a 

conducting epitaxy layer (16), which is applied to a conducting 
semiconductor substrate (18) of the opposite conductivity. On 

the outer surface (20) of the membrane facing away from the 
semiconductor substrate (18) at least one piezoresistor (22) is 

incorporated. Between the semiconductor substrate (18) and the 
epitaxy layer (16) an annularly structured intermediate layer 

(28) is incorporated, which defines a region (26@), adjoining the 
inner surface (24) of the membrane, of an opening (26) extending 

through the semiconductor substrate (18). This opening (26) is 
produced by anisotropic semiconductor etching, the intermediate 

layer (28) having a conductivity which is opposite to that of the 
semiconductor substrate so that in addition to the epitaxy layer 

(16) furthermore this intermediate layer (28) functions as an 
etch stopping means and is not attacked by the etchant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a semiconductor device comprising a
piezoresistive pressure sensor, which has a membrane which is
constituted by a conducting epitaxy layer which is applied to a
semiconductor substrate of the opposite type of conductivity, at
least one piezoresistor being incorporated on the external
surface of the membrane turned away from the semiconductor
substrate and the internal surface of the membrane is etched free
through an opening penetrating the semiconductor substrate. The
invention furthermore relates to a method for the production of
such a semiconductor device.In the case of such devices the piezoresistive pressure
sensor is provided in order to obtain the maximum degree of
integration on a semiconductor substrate. The piezoresistors
serve as transducers, the piezoresistive effect being profited
from in order to obtain an electrical signal representative of
the obtaining pressure in a measuring system.A condition for the desired linear pressure to voltage
transfer function is not only a minimum flexure of the membrane,
but furthermore more particularly an accurate positioning of the
piezoresistors. The same should as far a possible be provided in
regions, in which the membrane has its maximum stress field. The
position of these regions on the outer side of the epitaxy layer
is however dependent on the position of the part of the epitaxy 
layer constituting such membrane, such part being determined by
the opening etched free from the rear side. What is controlling
here is the region of the opening directly adjacent to the
epitaxy layer, since it the edge of the membrane.This opening region which is responsible for defining the
membrane is however not dependent on the particularities of
electrochemical anisotropic semiconductor etching, but
furthermore and more particularly on the respective positioning
of the rear side mask and the thickness of the semiconductor
substrate. Since both the positioning of the rear side mask in
relation to the front side of the semiconductor device and
furthermore the thickness of the wafer are always subject to
certain fluctuations, the desired linearity of the transfer
function is not attained in every case. The reproducibility of
linear piezoresistive pressure sensors is therefore impaired by
certain production parameters.On the other hand one object of the invention is to provide
such a further development of the semiconductor device of the
type initially mentioned and of the method for the production
thereof that using the simplest possible
