<ABSTRACT>
A process for the continuous thermal cracking of hyd­
rocarbon oils, which comprises preheating (2) the hydrocar­

bon oil feed (1) and causing the hot feed to flow upwards 
through a soaking vessel (4) in which the feed has an average 

residence time between 5 min. and 60 min. In order to achieve 
a good residence time distribution of the hydrocarbon oil 

feed, the soaking vessel comprises at least 2 mixing stages. To 
obtain the desired amount of mixing stages internals, prefer­

ably perforated plates (5), are installed in the soaking vessel. 
In this way more stable cracked residues are obtained.
