<ABSTRACT>
A protective coating system for superalloys 
is described. The coating is an active element enriched 

aluminide, and can be formed by aluminizing an overlay 
coated superalloy, wherein during the aluminizing 

process, aluminum diffuses completely through the 
overlay coating and into the substrate. The coating 

system exhibits desirable oxidation resistance and 
resistance to thermal fatigue cracking, due to the 

presence of oxygen active elements in the overlay.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for 
producing a coated Ni or Co base superalloy article 
having resistance to oxidation and thermal fatigue. The superalloys are a class of materials 
which exhibit desirable mechanical properties at high 
temperatures. These alloys generally contain major 
amounts of nickel, cobalt and/or iron either alone or in 
combination, as their basis material, and alloying 
additions of elements such as chromium, aluminum, 
titanium, and the refractory metals. Superalloys have 
found numerous applications in gas turbine engines. In most gas turbine applications, it is 
important to protect the surface of the engine component 
from oxidation and corrosion degradation, as such attack 
may materially shorten the useful life of the component, 
and cause significant performance and safety problems. Coatings can be used to protect superalloy 
engine components from oxidation and corrosion. The well 
known family of coatings commonly referred to as MCrAlY 
coatings, where M is selected from the group consisting 
of iron, nickel, cobalt, and various mixtures thereof, 
can markedly extend the service life of gas turbine 
engine blades, vanes, and like components. MCrAlY 
coatings are termed overlay coatings, denoting the fact 
that they are deposited onto the superalloy surface as 
an alloy, and do not interact significantly with the 
substrate during the deposition process or during 
service use. As is well known in the art, MCrAlY 
coatings can be applied by various techniques such as 
physical vapor deposition, sputtering or plasma 
spraying. MCrAlY coatings may also include additions of 
noble metals, hafnium, or silicon, either alone or in 
combination. They may also include other rare earth 
elements in combination with or substitution for 
yttrium. See, e.g., the following  
 
US-A-3,542,530, 3,918 139, 
3,928,026, 3,993,454, 4,034,142 and Re. 32, 121. US patent Re. 32 121 states that MCrAlY 
coatings are the most effective coatings for protecting 
superalloys from oxidation and corrosion attack. Aluminide coatings are also well known in 
the art as capable of providing oxidation and corrosion 
protection to superalloys. See, for example, US-A-3,544,348, 
3,961,098, 4,070,507 and 4,132,816. During the aluminizing process there is 
significant interaction between the aluminum and the 
substrate; the substrate chemistry and deposition 
temperature exert a major influence on coating 
chemistry, thickness and properties. A disadvantage of 
aluminide coatings is that in the
