<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for call
establishment in a cellular radio system comprising a
mobile services switching centre and a private branch
exchange connected thereto, and a visitor location
register for storing subscriber and location data on
subscribers located within the service area of the
mobile services switching centre, in which method: the
mobile services switching centre is requested to establish
a call to a subscriber, the mobile services
switching centre requests the visitor location register
to provide location data of the subscriber.Various cellular radio systems or mobile telephone
systems are in use and being designed in which
the geographic coverage area of the system is divided
into smaller separate service areas, i.e. cells, in
such a way that when the radiotelephone or mobile telephone
is located in a cell, it communicates with the
fixed network through a fixed radio station incorporated
in the cell. The mobile telephones belonging to
the system can roam freely within the area of the network
from one cell to another. One such system is the
digital mobile telephone system GSM (Global System for
Mobiles).Cordless telephone (CT) systems, such as the
DECT system, have recently come out on the market. The
DECT system comprises a base station, which is normally
based on access to an existing fixed telephone network.
There are three main types of base stations: a residential
base station, a base station connected to a private
branch exchange in an office, and telepoint base
stations.Cordless telephone systems can also be connected
to mobile telephone networks, for instance to the GSM 
system. The private branch exchange (PBX) of a cordless
telephone system can be connected to the GSM system for
example by using "DSS 1, Q.930-Q.940, 1989, Digital
Subscriber Signalling System No. 1, Network Layer,
User-Network Management, CCITT" signalling supplemented
with mobility management messages. The PBX of a cordless
telephone system is connected to the switching
centre of the GSM system such that the subscribers in
the PBX can roam within the service area of the GSM
system, and the subscribers in the PBX can make use of
the mobility management procedures of the GSM system
and roam within the service area of DECT systems connected
to the GSM system. In such a case, mobile subscribers
are attached to the PBX in accordance with the
DECT radio path protocol "ETS 300175, Radio Equipment
and Systems (RES), Digital European Cordless Telecommunications
(DECT), Common Interface", for instance. It

<CLAIMS>
A method for call establishment in a cellular
radio system comprising a mobile services switching

centre (MSC) and a private branch exchange (PBX) connected
thereto, and a visitor location register (VLR)

for storing subscriber and location data on subscribers
(CPP) located within the service area of the mobile

services switching centre (MSC), in which method

the mobile services switching centre (MSC) is
requested to establish a call to a subscriber,
the mobile services switching centre requests
(106) the visitor location register (VLR) to provide

location data of the subscriber,
the method being 
characterized

in that
the visitor location register stores information
(405) on whether the subscriber (CPP) is located within

the service area of its home private branch exchange
(PBX) indicated with a home location area identifier,
in response to the location data request (106)
placed by the mobile services switching centre the visitor

location register (VLR) checks (404) the subscriber
data of the subscriber and finds that the subscriber

(CPP) is located within the service area of its
home private branch exchange (PBX) indicated with a

home location area identifier,
the visitor location register (VLR) does not
initiate the mobility management functions (107, 108,

109, 110, 111 and 112) pertaining to normal connection

establishment in the system performed by the mobile
services switching centre but sends (213) to the mobile

services switching centre an indication of the fact
that the call can be switched, 
the mobile services switching centre (MSC) sends
(214) a connection establishment request to the private

branch exchange (PBX) of the home location area of the
subscriber (CPP),
the home private branch exchange (PBX) of the
subscriber performs the necessary operations (215, 216,

217, 218) for establishing a connection and establishes
(119) a connection between the subscriber (CPP) and the

mobile services switching centre (MSC).
A method for call establishment as claimed in
claim 1, 
characterized
 in that in connection
with the location updating of the

subscribers, information is transmitted (403) to the
visitor location register on the fact that the subscriber

(CPP) is located within the service area of its
home PBX.
A method for call establishment as claimed in
claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that a
home subscriber database (405) specific to each home

private branch exchange (PBX) is formed in the visitor
location register (VLR) connected to said mobile services

switching centre (MSC) out of the identifiers of
those subscribers (CPP) whose home location area is said

home private branch exchange (PBX).
A method for call establishment as claimed in
claim 3, 
characterized
 in that as the
subscriber (CPP) arrives in the service area of the

home private branch exchange (PBX) and performs (401)
location updating, the visitor location register (VLR)

of the location area of the subscriber checks (404)
from the home PBX specific home subscriber database

(405) whether the identifier of said subscriber is
found in the home subscriber database (405).
