<ABSTRACT>
A method for simultaneous multilayer application comprises 
applying of liquid substances as two or more mutually-overlaid 

layers to a continuously moving web. The liquid substance 
adjoining the surface of the moving web is water, whereas the 

other liquid substance adjoining the water layer forms a layer 
of larger thickness than the water and is a water-soluable 

composite substance of high viscosity. Specifically, the 
viscosity of the liquid substance adjoining the water is 40 cps 

or more at a shear rate of 100 sec

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
applying a liquid to a
continuously moving web in manufacturing a
photographic photosensitive material such as a
photographic film and printing paper, a
photoengraving material or a recording material such
as pressure-sensitive recording paper and
thermosensitive recording paper. More particularly,
the invention relates to a method of simultaneously
applying liquids as two or more
mutually-overlaid layers to a continuously moving
web.A method of rapid simultaneous multilayer
application in a slide-hopper-type application device
or the like was disclosed in the United
States Patent No.4,001,024. In
order to increase the application speed in the
method, a liquid having a viscosity as low
as 1 mPas (1 cps) to 8 mPas (8 cps) is applied as the lowermost layer
to a web to set the degree of wet application of the
liquid substance at 2 cm3 to 12 cm3 per 1 m2 of the
surface of the web. A meniscoid vortical movement is
allowed only to mix the lowermost layer and the
second lowermost layer with each other but not
allowed to affect the other layers.A method of applying to a web a thin carrier
layer of a pseudo-plastic liquid substance of 20 mPas (20 cps)
to 200 mPas (200 cps) in viscosity at the shear rate of
100 sec-1 and 10 mPas (10 cps) or less in viscosity at the 
shear rate of 100,000 sec-1 was disclosed in
the United States Patent
No.4,113,903. In the method, the pseudo-plastic
liquid whose viscosity is high at
the low shear rate and low at the high shear
rate is used as the lowermost layer on the web in
order to eliminate the instability of an application
bead, as in the method disclosed in the United
States Patent No. 4,001,024. The liquid
is characterized in that it performs non-Newtonian
flow. The liquid needs to be a
selected special composite substance and subjected to
careful preparation.DE-A-3 238 904 discloses a simultaneous multilayer coating in which a low viscosity liquid
is used for the first layer next to the web and a high viscosity liquid is used for the
second layer. JP-A-60 255 172 describes a multilayer simultaneously coating method for
applying coating compositions which are flowing in the state of a plurality of layers, at the
same time onto a moving belt like support.As shown in the Japanese Patent Application
(OPI) No. 54975/1988 (not prior art) the present
inventor has developed a method of rapid simultaneous
multilayer application in a slide-hopper-type
application device. The method is characterized in
that a liquid for making the

<CLAIMS>
A method of simulataneous multilayer application to a continuously moving web,
comprising the steps:


continuously conveying said web around a backup roller;
simultaneously applying liquids in form of at least two mutually-overlaid layers to
said continuously moving web, said liquid adjoining the surface of the web being

water to form a lowermost layer and the other liquid adjoining said water layer is a
water soluble liquid having a viscosity not less than 40 mPas (40 cps) at a shear

rate of 100 sec
-1
 measured at 40Â°C, wherein said water soluble liquid is applied in
a larger thickness than the water layer, as measured in the wet state.
