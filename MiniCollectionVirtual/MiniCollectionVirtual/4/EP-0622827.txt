<ABSTRACT>
A photomultiplier is constituted by a 
photocathode and an electron multiplier having a 

typical structure in which a dynode unit having a 
plurality of dynode plates stacked in an incident 

direction of photoelectrons, an anode plate, and an 
inverting dynode plate are sequentially stacked. 

Through holes (101) for injecting a metal vapor are formed 
in the inverting dynode plate (13) to form secondary 

electron emitting layers on the surfaces of dynodes 
supported by the dynode plates, and the photocathode. 

With this structure, the secondary electron emitting 
layers are uniformly formed on the surfaces of the 

dynodes. Therefore, variations in output signals 
obtained from anodes can be reduced regardless of the 

positions of the photocathode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron 
multiplier and a photomultiplier. More specifically 
the present invention relates to an electron 
multiplier comprising a dynode unit, an anode plate 
and an inverting dynode plate for cascade-multiplying 
photoelectrons. The invention also relates to a 
method of manufacturing an electron multiplier or a 
photomultiplier. Conventionally, photomultipliers have been widely 
used for various measurements in nuclear medicine and 
high-energy physics as a γ-camera, PET (Positron 
Emission Tomography), or calorimeter. A conventional electron multiplier constitutes a 
photomultiplier having a photocathode. This electron 
multiplier is constituted by anodes and a dynode unit 
having a plurality of stages of dynodes stacked in the 
incident direction of an electron flow in a vacuum 
container. In the general manufacture of a  
 
photomultiplier, when a vacuum container is evacuated, 
and at the same time, an alkali metal vapor is 
introduced to deposit and activate a photocathode on 
the inner surface of a light receiving plate and a 
secondary electron emitting layer on each dynode, the 
alkali metal vapor flows from the peripheral portion 
to the central portion of the light receiving plate or 
each dynode. Therefore, if no means for passing the 
metal vapor is provided near the inverting dynodes, 
the alkali metal layer is deposited to be thin at the 
central portion and thick at the peripheral portion on 
the surface of the light receiving plate or each 
dynode. Fig. 1 is a graph showing the relationship 
between positions on the photocathode and the anode 
output in a photomultiplier having no means for 
passing the metal vapor near the inverting dynodes, as 
described above. A position on the circular 
photocathode is plotted along the abscissa, in which 
the origin represents the center of the photocathode, 
and a relative value of the output signal from the 
anode with respect to the light incident on each 
position on the photocathode is plotted along the 
ordinate. As a result, the output signals from the 
anodes decrease by about 40% at the central portion of 
the photocathode as compared to the peripheral portion  
 
thereof. Therefore, in such a photomultiplier, it is 
found that the sensitivity of the output signals 
greatly varies in correspondence with positions on the 
photocathode at which the light is incident. The present invention aims to provide a 
photomultiplier capable of obtaining a uniform 
sensitivity with respect to positions on
