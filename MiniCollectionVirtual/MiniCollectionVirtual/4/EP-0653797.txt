<ABSTRACT>
The lithium secondary cell uses lithium or a compound containing lithium as the negative electrode, and 
lithium nickel oxide as the active material for the positive electrode. This cell is produced to enhance the charge and 

discharge capacity. The lithium nickel oxide is prepared as follows. Nickel oxide which contains nickel of more than 
trivalence or a nickel salt which produces nickel of more than trivalence when heated, and lithium salt are mixed at 

an Li/Ni (mole ratio) of 1.0 to 1.5. After preheating the mixture, it is baked at a temperature of 680° to 780° in 
an oxygen atmosphere, thus producing a lithium nickel oxide. The primary differential absorption spectrum of the 

electron spin resonance of the lithium nickel oxide is a singlet when measured by use of an X band at a temperature 
of 77K, and the line distance (ΔHpp) between the peaks is 140 mT or more. The intensity ratios of the main peaks of 

the components other than the lithium nickel oxide and that of the lithium nickel oxide in a powder X-ray diffraction 
image are lower than 0.03. The Li/Ni ratio (mole ratio) is above 0.9, and the grain size of the primary particles is 

below 1 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lithium secondary
battery, particularly relates to a lithium secondary battery
comprising a lithium nickel oxide as an improved cathode active
material, the cathode active material and a method for
preparing said nickel oxide.The lithium nickel oxide is LiNiO2 when the ratio of
Li (lithium) and Ni (nickel) is 1:1 (atomic ratio) exactly
according to the stoichiometric composition ratio, and
possesses a lamellar structure same as LiCoO2 or the like, and
hence its utility as cathode active material for lithium
secondary battery is expected.However, in the conventional synthesis of lithium
nickel oxide, the ratio of Li and Ni tends to deviate from
the stoichiometric composition ratio, and Ni invades into Li
layer and the lamellar structure is disturbed, and therefore
when used as cathode active material for lithium secondary
battery, the charging and discharging capacity is smaller than
the value expected from LiNiO2 with Li and Ni atomic ratio of
1:1. Specifically describing the method of synthesis of
conventional lithium nickel oxide and the Li/Ni atomic ratio
of thus synthesized lithium nickel oxide, hitherto, the lithium
nickel oxide was synthesized by heating the lithium hydroxide
hydrate (LiOH·H2O) and nickel (Ni) powder in oxygen (O2)
atmosphere at 750°C for 12 hours, pulverizing again, and
further baking, as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent
Tokkosho No. 63-59507.What is actually obtained is, however, not LiNiO2 at
the stoichiometric composition ratio of 1:1 (atomic ratio) of
Li and Ni, but is a composition of Li0.85Ni1.15O2, and its Li/Ni
ratio (atomic ratio) is 0.74, in which the lamellar structure
was disturbed, and when used as cathode active material for
lithium secondary battery, only a battery of small charging and
discharging capacity was obtained as mentioned above.If Li/Ni ratio (atomic ratio) is 1 according to the
stoichiometric composition ratio, since it is possible that the
crystal configuration of Li and Ni is random or disorder and
it is believed that a part of Ni may invade into the layer of
Li, thereby charging and discharging capacity being decreasing.
