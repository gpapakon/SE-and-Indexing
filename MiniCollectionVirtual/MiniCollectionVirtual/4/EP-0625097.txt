<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the well-known problem that books and particularly hoop paper binders on a shelf are liable to tilt over, if they are not effectively supported at the sides. According to the invention this problem may be overcome in a simple manner in that the book members, at their lower back area, are provided with an angle plate (10) having a flange portion (14), which projects freely forwardly along a rear lower edge area of the book member, whereby, when the book member is placed on the shelf (2) the flange portion (14) can be inserted into holding engagement with a forwardly open holding groove (6) of the shelf or underneath the front edge of the shelf.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A system for lateral support of standing book member^ particularly paper binders, and a book member and a support member therefor.The present invention relates to a system for lateral support of standing book members, particularly paper binders, on shelves or other support surfaces. It has always been normal that books are supported in an upright position on a shelf or a corresponding carrier surface by means of appropriate lateral support in the shape of other book members or special lateral end members, which occupy individual space on the bookshelf and merely function as inserted separator plate members on the shelf. It would be desirable that each book member could be placed in a stabilized manner with no use of lateral support, and especially desirable in connection with half-empty hoop paper binders, which tend to fall in an unorderly manner if they are not provided with immediate lateral support.A few proposals are known, by which books may be placed in such a manner as to provide a stable positioning of the books, almost as a side effect. It is thus indicated in US-A-1,277,544 that a fixed hinge pipe is placed in front of the front edge of the shelf and serves for rotatable reception of a lower, bent end portion of an upwardly protruding plate member, the width of which corresponds to or is slightly larger than the width of the back of an associated book. The plate member projects upwardly along a certain portion of the back of the book and is provided at its opposite sides with inwardly projecting plate webs, between which the lower portion of the back of the book is received. The book is released for removal by downward rotation of the plate member about the hinge rod, and the aim in connection with this system is that in libraries, by marking the book title on the outwardly oriented face of the plate member, the concerned space is automatically reserved for the concerned book, thus providing added security of correct repositioning of the 

 book. When the plate member is rotated back into place after insertion of the book, there will furthermore be provided a lateral stabilization of the book, but for a more general use, this system is irrelevant.In US-A-3,635,351 a bookshelf is indicated, in front of which is coupled a reading desk, in which the books are placed upside down, being connected at the lower end of their backs to a rotatable fitting flush with the reading desk, such that the books may be rotated forwards individually for positioning on the desk. When the book is opened in this

C L A I M S
1. A system for lateral support of book members, especially hoop paper binders, on book shelves or other carrier surfaces, comprising holder members for mounting on the book members at the lower edge area thereof, and provided with protruding engagement portions for releasable engagement with longitudinal profiled members on the shelves or carrying surfaces, characterized in that the engagement portions of the holder members are constituted by substantially horizontal flange portions, which, in connection with the movement of insertion of a book member, are arranged for being guided into a holding groove extending in the longitudinal direction of the shelf or generally in the corresponding direction of the carrying surface.
2. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the holding groove is provided by means of a profiled rib fastened to the top side of the shelf or carrying surface and at one longitudinal edge having a horizontal flange portion, which for forming the holding groove is slightly raised above the said top surface.
3. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the holding groove is formed as a front edge groove in the carrying shelf.
4. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the holding groove is constituted by the free space under the front edge area of the shelf, the holder members being provided with the engagement flanges positioned at a distance underneath the lower edges of the book members corresponding to the thickness of the front edge area of the shelf.
5. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the holder members are provided with gripping portions for clamp-wise fastening of the outer shelf and back cover of the book members. 


 6. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the holder members are provided with upright clamp portions for fastening on to the lower, plane back area of a paper binder.
7. A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the flange portions are further adapted for engagent with the holding groove by a light clamping engagement.
8. A book member, especially a hoop paper binder, for use in a system accrording to claim 1, characterized in that the book member is embodied in integration with the said flange portion.
9. A book member according to claim 8, characterized in that the flange portion projects inwards under the lower back portion of the member at a distance which corresponds to the thickness of a standard shelf.
10. A support member for placing on a book member for use in a system according to claim 1, characterized in that it is constituted by a holder member with coupling portions for fastening on a book member and with an engagement flange for cooperation with a subjacent receiving groove on or in a shelf, or for engagement below the front edge area of a shelf, respectively.
