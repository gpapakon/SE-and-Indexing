<ABSTRACT>
Distillate fuels, for example diesel and jet fuels, with 
excellent cold flow properties are produced from waxy Fischer-Tropsch 

products by separating the product into a heavier and a lighter 
fraction; isomerizing the heavier fraction; hydrotreating and 

isomerizing the lighter fraction; and recovering products in the 
required fuel ranges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of middle distillates, suitable for use
as, or in, diesel or jet fuels, having excellent low temperature properties. More
particularly, this invention relates to the production of such distillate fuels from a
waxy hydrocarbon produced by the reaction of CO and hydrogen, for example in a
Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis process.The waxy product of a hydrocarbon synthesis product, particularly the
product from a cobalt based catalyst process, contains a high proportion of normal
paraffins. Nevertheless, the products from hydrocarbon synthesis must be useful in a
wide variety of applications, just as are the products from naturally occurring
petroleum. Indeed, the products must be fungible and the application must not be
affected by the source of the product. Waxy products provide notoriously poor cold
flow properties making such products difficult or impossible to use where cold flow
properties are vital, e.g., lubes, diesel fuels, jet fuels.Cold flow properties can be improved by increasing the branching of
distillates within the proper range as well as by hydrocracking heavier components.
Hydrocracking, however, produces gaseous and light products that tend to reduce the
yield of valuable distillates, and there remains a desire for maximizing distillates
obtained from Fischer-Tropsch waxes.EP-A-0471524 discloses a method for producing a light oil of low viscosity
and high viscosity index out of a heavy bottoms fraction boiling above a cut-off
temperature in the range 580-600+°C, obtained by the fractionation of isomerate
produced by the hydroisomerization of heavy waxes, said method comprising the
steps of severely hydrotreating the heavy bottoms fraction over a catalyst and refractionating
the severely hydrotreated fraction. The said severe hydrotreating
conditions may include a temperature in the range of from 300 to 500°C, a pressure
in the range 500 to 5000 psig (3.45 to 34.48 MPa), a hydrogen treat gas rate of 250 to 
5000 SCF H2/bbl feed (0.0445 to 0.89 m3H2/liter feed) and a space velocity of 0.1 to
10.0 v/v/hr. A suitable catalyst may be selected from the metals, oxides and sulfides
of Group VIB and non-noble Group VIII on a refractory metal oxide support. The
method may comprise a dewaxing step performed prior to or after the re-fractionation
step. The said re-fractionation step may be practised to recover the oil fraction
boiling in the 330°C to 580°C-600°C range. The severely hydrotreated bottoms
fraction may be subjected to mild condition
