<ABSTRACT>
A hose (1,2,3) for the cooling water of a motor vehicle is proposed, the elastomer constituents of which are formed, in up to 50% by weight, by extremely finely ground scrap rubber, thereby making a major contribution both to the reuse of raw materials, and consequently to environmental conservation, and to the lowering of costs.

<CLAIMS>
Automotive vehicle radiator hose, the wall of which 
is formed from elastomeric materials and has an inner layer 

(1) and an outer layer (2), a textile reinforcing member 
(3) being able to be disposed, more especially, between 

these layers, the inner layer (1) and/or the outer layer 
(2) comprising elastomeric mixtures and containing the 

conventional parts by weight of accelerator mixture, 
characterised in that, in the elastomeric mixtures, 25 to 

50 % by wt. of the conventional elastomeric proportion are 
replaced by powdered rubber, which is formed by physically 

comminuting waste rubber by means of very finely grinding 
methods known per se, and the particle size of said rubber 

is substantially smaller than 0.2 mm. 
Automotive vehicle radiator hose according to claim 
1, characterised in that the particle size of the powdered 

rubber used is substantially smaller than 0.05 mm. 
Automotive vehicle radiator hose according to claim 
1 or 2, characterised in that, in the elastomeric mixtures 

of the inner layer and/or outer layer (1, 2), 30 to 40 % by 
wt. of the conventional elastomeric proportion are replaced 

by very finely ground powdered waste rubber.
