selected from salts of nitric, chloric and perchloric acid with acylic 

nitrogen bases, having no more than two hydrogen atoms bonded to the or 
each basic nitrogen atom and up to three carbon atoms per basic nitrogen 

atom, and the salts of nitric, chloric, and perchloric acid with a 
phenyl amine, and the water 

content is less than 10% by weight, of the composition. 
The process comprises (a) to mix (i) a thickened 
aqueous phase containing an aqueous solution of water

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an explosive
composition of the type known as a watergel and to a
process for manufacturing this explosive composition. This
composition is formulted with a low water content and the
process used for its manufacture yields a product with a
rheology and hygroscopicity which makes its cartridging in
paper cartridges possible on existing machines.Watergel explosives, also known as slurry explosives,
are widely used in many applications. They perform well
and offer advantages over conventional nitroglycerine-based
explosives in terms of improved safety in
manufacture, use and storage.In essence a watergel explosive consists of a fluid
mixture of oxidiser salts, fuels, thickeners, sensitisers
and crosslinking agents. Normally, watergel explosives are
two phase systems (which can be prepared as a single
phase), and contain between 10% and 30% water. Thus, a
portion of the oxidiser salts and occasionally the
sensitiser are dissolved in the water and the balance are
dispersed in the solution. To improve the dispersion
capacity of the solids in the solution, thickeners that
raise the viscosity of the system are added, thus ensuring
a greater homogeneity of the final product.Because of the high water content, the product
initially has a fluid consistency that allows easy pouring
of it directly into the blast holes. However, as long as
the product remains fluid it is not possible to pack it in
the standard paper cartridges used, for example, for
packaging nitroglycerine-based explosives as the watergel 
wets the paper and it disintegrates. The consistency of a
watergel thus necessitates cartridging of the product in
hermetically sealed plastics containers, generally of high
or low density polyethylene. Watergels cartridged in
plastic do not load well into boreholes because the
plastic packaging resists breaking thereby preventing the
explosive from filling the boreholes properly. Also, the
plastics packaging itself is not suitable for use in many
mines, for example asbestos mines and diamond mines.The gelatinous and powder explosives sensitised with
nitroglycerine, nitroglycol or other nitrates of alcohols
or mixtures thereof, have the advantage that they can be
easily cartridged in paper. However, the use of these
explosives presents problems for the user, on the one hand
because these sensitisers are vasodilators and they cause
headaches and other circulatory problems, and on the other
hand because the detonation fumes contain a high
percentage of toxic gasses such as oxides of
