<ABSTRACT>
A transponder is to be designed in such a manner and fastened to that point of a transport container which is easily accessible and provides optimum signal transmission and signal reception, the transponder being intended to be fastened on the transport container in a manner which saves as much space as possible and which has as little need as possible for changing the shape of the transport container. This is achieved by arranging the transponder (3) in the centre in or on the baseplate (5) of the transport container (1) and by designing it either as a flat disc or an annular disc and by accommodating it in a correspondingly shaped recess (2) in the baseplate or by fastening it to the plane baseplate or by designing it as a rod and accommodating it in a recess of a carrier strip fastened on the plane baseplate of the transport container.
