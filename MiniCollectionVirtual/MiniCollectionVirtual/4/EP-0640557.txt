<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for supplying fuel to motor vehicles, having a plurality of hoses (4) which are each provided with a fuel-pump nozzle (3) and, for filling the tanks of the vehicles, can be drawn out of the housing (1) counter to a return force, for which purpose each hose (4), fastened in the housing (1) by one end, is guided at least over one roller (2) fitted in the housing (1). In order to reduce the structural outlay in order to generate the return force, the invention proposes that all the hoses (4), for generating their return force, be connected to a common force generator (10, 11).

Appliance for the dispensing of fuels to 
vehicles, with a plurality of tapping hoses (4) which are 

each provided with a tapping valve (3) and which can be 
pulled out of a housing (1) counter to a return force for 

the tank-filling operation, for which purpose each 
tapping hose (4) fastened at one end in the housing (1) 

is guided at least via a roller (2) arranged in the 
housing (1), characterized in that all the tapping hoses 

(4) are connected to a common force generator (10, 11) 
for the purpose of generating their return force. 
Appliance according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the force generator is formed by a weight (10) 

and/or a spring (11). 
Appliance according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that each tapping hose (4) is connected 

to the force generator (10, 11) via a flexible tension 
element (9). 
Appliance according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the flexible tension element (9) is fastened 

directly to the tapping hose (4). 
Appliance according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the flexible tension element (9) is connected to the 

shaft (20) of a deflecting roller (21) guiding the 
tapping hose (4). 
Appliance according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that each tapping hose (4) is guided via a 

deflecting roller (21), in that all the deflecting 
rollers (21) are mounted rotatably on a common shaft 

(20), and in that this shaft (20) is arranged in the 
housing (1) so as to be vertically movable counter to the  

 
force of the force generator (10, 11). 
Appliance according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that each deflecting roller (21) is mounted rotatably on 

the common shaft (20) independently of the other deflecting 
rollers (21). 
Appliance according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that hose guides (30) for the individual tapping hoses 

(4) are formed in the housing (1). 
Appliance according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that all the deflecting rollers (21) are designed as a 

continuous cylinder (50). 
Appliance according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the surface of the cylinder (50) is designed with 

concave guide faces (51) which are each assigned to a 
tapping hose (4). 
Appliance according to at least one of Claims 6 
to 10, characterized in that the ends of the shaft (20) 

are guided in the housing (1) so as to be vertically 
movable via guides (23-25). 
Appliance according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the guides of the shafts (20) are designed as slides 

(23-24) guided on the end faces of the housing (1). 
Appliance according to at least one of Claims 6 
to 12, characterized in that the force generator is 

designed as a spring (11) arranged on the shaft (20). 
Appliance according to at least one of Claims 1 
to 13, characterized in that each tapping hose (4) is 

additionally guided via a roller (2) mounted fixedly in 
the housing (1). 
Appliance according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that all the rollers (2) are mounted rotatably on a 

common shaft (6).
