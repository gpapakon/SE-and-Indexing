<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger (10) and method of making same is disclosed. The heat exchanger (10) is particularly useful for cooling automotive engine oil or transmission fluid, the exchanger (10) being located inside the radiator or other part of the engine cooling system. The heat exchanger (10) is made from a plurality of stacked plates (12) formed of cladded metal, the plates (12) being assembled into face-to-face pairs, each pair having a turbulizer (38) located therein. The plates (12) also have outwardly disposed dimples (36) which are in contact when the plates (12) are arranged back-to-back. The turbulizer (38) is thicker than the spacing between the assembled plates (12) prior to brazing the assembly. The dimples (36) maintain good contact between all heat transfer surfaces while the assembly is completed by brazing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a heat exchanger, and to heat
exchangers, and in particular to automotive oil coolers which are located inside
other heat exchangers, such as automotive radiators.In motor vehicles, it is common to provide heat exchangers for cooling engine oil
or transmission fluid. Due to the heat transfer characteristics of oil, liquid cooled
heat exchangers are normally used as opposed to air cooled exchangers. The
most convenient way to do this is to mount the oil cooler or heat exchanger inside
the cooling system of the motor vehicle, and in particular inside the radiator.In the past, the oil coolers of the type in question which have been mounted
inside automotive radiators have consisted in concentric tubes closed at both
ends to form an intemal passage for the oil. The engine coolant flows around
the outside tube and through the inside tube. A difficulty with this type of oil
cooler, however, is that it is relatively ineffective per volume of radiator
occupied.An improvement over the concentric tube type oil coolers is shown in EP-A-384612,
which shows a plurality of stacked plate pairs having turbulizers located
therebetween. The plate pairs in EP-A-384612 have first and second plates
located back to back. The first plate has a planar central portion, a raised peripheral
edge portion located above and in a plane parallel to the central portion,
an intermediate portion between the central and edge portions, and opposed
end bosses located below and in a plane parallel to the central portion. The
second plate of each plate pair has a peripheral edge portion joined to the first
plate peripheral edge portion, a central portion spaced from the first plate central
portion, an intermediate portion between the central and edge portions and
opposed end bosses located above and in a plane parallel to the second plate
central portion. The first and second plate central portions have a planar
expanded metal turbilizer located therebetween and a plurality of spaced-apart,
outwardly disposed dimples formed therein, the dimples extending equidistant
with the end bosses. The dimples and end bosses are joined together. Each 
plate pair has inlet and outlet openings for the flow of fluid therethrough past the
turbulizer.A difficulty with this prior art oil cooler, however, is that peripheral tabs are required
to be crimped over to join the peripheral edge portions and form plate
pair subassemblies prior to brazing the assembly together, otherwise poor joints
could result between the

edge portions (30) are still spaced apart; compressing the turbulizer by

pressing the plate pair (12) together thereby melting the turbulizer (38) into
said plates drawing the mating peripheral edge portions together; and
joining contacting areas of the plates and turbulizer after the mating peripheral
edge portions are drawn together to form a fluid tight assembly.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the step of compressing is done by
squeezing together the planar central portions (28).
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2 and further comprising the steps of providing
a cladding layer (50) on the plates, melting the cladding layer while

compressing the turbulizer (38) and embedding the turbulizer in the cladding
layer until the peripheral edge portions (30) come into contact.
A method as claimed in claim 2 or 3 wherein the squeezing step is done by
providing said central portions (28) with a plurality of spaced-apart, outwardly

disposed dimples (36), the dimples extending equidistant with the end bosses

in a back-to-back arrangement, the dimples on the adjacent plate pairs
being in alignment and transmitting compressive forces therebetween.
