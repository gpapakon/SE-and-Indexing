<ABSTRACT>
A teletext receiver has a television signal input circuit (2, 3) for receiving a 
television signal including teletext data signals, a teletext signal processor 

(12) for decoding the teletext data signals and obtaining teletext data, a teletext 
memory (14) for storing teletext data, the teletext signal processor 

(12) generating teletext picture according to the teletext data, and a display 
(10) for displaying the teletext picture. The teletext signal processor 

(12) reads out the teletext data from the teletext memory (14) at double of 
the speed for displaying the teletext picture on the full size of screen and 

the display (10) displays the teletext picture at half size on one half of the 
screen thereof. The teletext signal processor (12) decodes teletext data for 

two pages and the display (10) displays teletext pictures of the two pages 
on the screen. The teletext signal processor (12) decodes teletext data for 

one or more pages with numbers included in one of the two pages displayed 
on a half area of the screen of the display. If one of the two pages includes 

one or more page numbers, and if any one of page numbers is selected, the 
teletext picture of the selected page is displayed on the other half of the 

screen. The teletext receiver may further comprise a picture in picture processor 
(11) for generating a video signal representing a video picture in 

smaller size than half of the screen size, and the display (10) displays the 
video picture in the small size on the other half of the screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a teletext receiver in accordance with the
precharacterizing parts of independent claims 1 and 2. A teletext receiver of
that kind is known from EP-A 0 561 028.In a conventional teletext receiver like a television receiver, a teletext picture
can be displayed on a screen selectively as the teletext picture only or the
teletext picture superimposed in or on a normal video picture. In both cases, the
normal video picture can not be seen at all or sufficiently when the teletext
picture is displayed.In another conventional television receiver, the normal video picture is
displayed as a main picture on a full screen and the teletext picture is displayed
as a picture in picture (hereinafter PIP) on a small window provided in the main
picture or vice versa as disclosed in JP-A-1 296 878, JP-A-1 296 879, JP-A-2
228 186 and European Patent EP-A-0 489 387, US-A-5,023,721 and US-A-5,128,766.
If the teletext picture is displayed as a PIP, it is difficult to read the
text of the teletext picture due to the small size of the PIP. On the contrary, if
the teletext picture is displayed as a main picture, a part of the teletext picture is
covered by the normal video picture and some important information may be
missing.It is also known from JP-A-57-206178, JP-A-61-105190, JP-A-61-193580 and
JP-A-1-276977 to split the screen vertically or horizontally into two areas
displaying the normal video picture and the teletext picture by controlling the
deflection system. However, the circuit construction to realize such display
configuration is complicated.EP-A-0 561 028 corresponding to the precharacterizing parts of independent
claims 1 and 2 provides a method for simultaneously displaying two pages of 
teletext by adjusting the width of the text page by means of changing the pixel
frequency of teletext decoder arranged within the television receiver or within a
video recorder connected thereto. By this method, one of the displayed pages
of teletext can be an index page received with the teletext program or a
list of selectable pages which is determined by a processor in the television
receiver or in a video recorder connected to this receiver. In addition, both displayed text pages may also
be pages of teletext. However, EP-A-0 561 028 does not disclose a page-shift-function
whereby, if the selection of the page number is confirmed, the teletext page of
the selected page number is displayed on the one half of the screen and the
following teletext page is displayed on the other half of the screen.EP-A-0

A teletext receiver comprising:

a television signal input circuit (2, 3, 4) for receiving a television
signal including a teletext data signal;
display means (10) having a screen for displaying a teletext picture;
teletext signal processor means (12) for decoding the teletext data
signal and obtaining teletext data; and
teletext memory means (14) for storing the obtained teletext data;
werein
said teletext signal processor means (12) reads out teletext data
including two teletext pages from the teletext memory means (14) at a

higher speed than the speed for displaying a teletext picture of one page
on the full size of that screen,
said display means (10) are displaying one of the two teletext pages
on one half of the screen and the other of the two teletext pages on the

other half of the screen; and
if the one of the two teletext pages indicates one or more page
numbers of teletext and if any of the indicated page numbers is selected,

a teletext page of the selected page number is displayed on the other
half of the screen,

characterized in that if the selection of the page number is confirmed, the
teletext page of the selected page number is displayed on the one half of

the screen and a following teletext page is displayed on the other half of
the screen.
