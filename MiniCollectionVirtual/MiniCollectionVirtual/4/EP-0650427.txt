<ABSTRACT>
A tandem master cylinder in which the primary and secondary pistons (3, 4) are held apart by at least two springs (9, 10) of which only one (9) is compressed in the piston starting position. As a result, pressures in the primary (6) and secondary (7) chambers quickly balance out without the springs being mounted in an adjustable-length housing.

Hydraulic tandem master cylinder comprising: 

a body (1) drilled through by an essentially cylindrical bore closed by 
an end-cap (1b); 
primary (3) and secondary (4) pistons capable of sliding in the bore, in 
a sealed fashion, from a rest position in which these pi
stons are furthest away from 
the end-cap as far as at least one specific actuation position (A) in which these 

pistons are moved closer to the end-cap; 
a primary hydraulic pressure chamber (6) defined between the primary 
and secondary pistons, this chamber containing first elastic means (9, 10) having a 

predetermined stiffness and exerting a first elastic force between the pistons in a 
direction which tends to move these pistons apart; 
a secondary hydraulic pressure chamber (7) defined between the 
secondary piston and the end-cap, this chamber containing second elastic means (12) 

having a predetermined stiffness and exerting a second elastic force between the 
secondary piston and the end-cap, in a direction which tends to move this secondary 

piston away from the end-cap, 
the first and second forces varying, for a movement of the pistons 
from the rest position as far as the said specific actuation position, from respective 

low values up to respective high values, the low value (F(12)
o
) of the second force 
being greater than that 
(F(9+10)
o
)
 of the first force; in which the first elastic means 
essentially comprise: 
a first prestressed spring (9) suitable for exerting, by itself, in the rest 
position of the pistons, at least the greatest part of the low value of the first force, 

and 
an additional spring (10) suitable for developing, for the specific 
position for actuating the pistons, a force which is added to that of the prestressed 

spring and which is several times greater than the force which this additional spring 
develops for the rest position of the pistons, characterized in that the high value 

(F(12)
a
) of the second force is less than that 
(F(9+10)
a
)
 of the first force, in that the 
first prestressed spring has a stiffness at least equal to that of the second elastic 

means, and in that the master-cylinder has any spring cage. 
Master cylinder according to Claim 1, characterized in that the second 
elastic means essentially comprise a second prestressed spring (12) of stiffness less 

than that of the first prestressed spring (9). 
Master cylinder according to Claim 2, characterized in that the first 
prestressed spring (9) and the additional spring (10) are arranged one inside the 

other. 
Master cylinder according to Claim 3, characterized in that the additional 
spring (10) is housed inside the first prestressed spring (9). 
Master cylinder according to Claim 3, characterized in that the additional 
spring (10) and the first prestressed spring (9) are coiled in opposite directions.
