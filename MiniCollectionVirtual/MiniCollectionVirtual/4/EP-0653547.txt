<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an additive for a well
cement to control the gel strength of and fluid loss from
the slurry, and to the use of the additive in a well
cement.In the art of cementing a wellbore penetrating a
subterranean earth formation, it is well known to provide a
sheath of hardened cement in the annular space between the
walls of the wellbore which penetrates the formation, and a
well pipe, such as a casing. The purpose of the sheath is
to support the casing in the wellbore and to prevent the
undesirable movement of formation fluids, i.e. oil, gas and
water, within the annular space between subsurface
formations and/or to the surface of the earth. The process
of forming the sheath is referred to as primary cementing.According to the well known process of primary
cementing, a slurry of hydraulic cement in water is formed,
the slurry is then pumped down the casing and then
circulated up from the bottom thereof in the annulus to a
desired location, and then permitted to set in the annulus
where the hydraulic cement 
reacts with the water in the slurry to form the sheath of
hardened cement.The slurry of cement, when first placed in the annulus,
acts as a true liquid and will, therefore, transmit
hydrostatic pressure. Thus, sufficient hydrostatic pressure
is exerted, as a feature of the process of primary cementing,
to balance the pressure of any gas in the formation to thereby
prevent the movement of gas from the formation into and
through the slurry in the annulus. Movement of gas from a
formation into and through a cement slurry in an annulus is
referred to in the art as gas migration.Gas migration is a problem in primary cementing which can
lead to movement of gas in the slurry from one formation to
another or even to the surface of the earth. Such movement
can cause loss of control of pressure and lead to a blowout.
As mentioned previously, gas migration can be controlled if
sufficient pressure can be transmitted through the slurry.
However, loss of control can be experienced and gas migration
can occur if the slurry does not possess the properties of a
true fluid and is unable to transmit hydrostatic pressure.Before a slurry of hydraulic cement sets into a hardened
mass having compressive strength, events take place which
cause the slurry to lose the ability to transmit hydrostatic
pressure. One of the events is the loss of fluid from the
slurry to the formation. Another event is the development of
static gel strength in the slurry.It seems clear that the loss of water from a slurry of 
ceme
