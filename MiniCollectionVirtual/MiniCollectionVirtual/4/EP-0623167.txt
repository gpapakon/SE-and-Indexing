Method for isolation of a mixture of viruses (A, B) of the Mystery Disease, i.e. a myxovirus
(A) of the type corresponding to the strain P129-294 filed at the CNCM under the number

1-1153 and a virus (B) corresponding to the strain P120-117B filed at the CNCM under the
number I-1163, comprising the removal of organs or of blood of sick or infected pigs, and

treatments of the floating matter from pulvensation or from the constituents of the blood
with sensitive heterologous or homologous cells, thereafter the extraction of the floating

matter.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the treatments are effected upon cells of
the line Vero, MDCK, ST, BHK.
Method for industrial production of a mixture of viruses (A, B) of the Mystery Disease, i.e.
a myxovirus (A) of the type corresponding to the strain P129-294 filed at the CNCM under

the number 1-1153 and a virus (B) corresponding to the strain P 120-117B filed at the
CNCM under the number 1-1163, in which the virus is cultivated on sensitive homologous

cells, primary cells from pigs, cells from the pig line, or heterologous cells, particularly cells
of the line Vero, MDCK, ST, BHK, and the final floating matter is extracted.
Purified preparation of the viral strain P 120-117 B filed at the CNCM under the number 1-1163.
Antigenic preparation comprising living particles, attenuated or not, or inactivated particles,
or viral sub-unit antigens, obtained from the preparation according to claim 4.
Vaccine against the Mystery Disease characterised in that it contains, in an appropriate
vehicle, a vaccinating quantity of a preparation according to one of the claims 4 and 5.
Attenuated vaccine according to claim 6, characterised in that it is prepared by the treatment
of the virus or viruses concerned with the cellular culture.
Attenuated vaccine according to claim 7, characterised in that the quantity of virus per
vaccinal dose lies between 10
3
 and 10
8
 DICC
50
. 
Inactivated vaccine according to claim 6, characterised in that the floating matter of the
culture is inactivated by a chemical or physical inactivating agent.
Inactivated vaccine according to claim 9, characterised in that it contains at least the
equivalent of 10
5
 DICC
50
 of virus per vaccinal dose.
Preparation for the diagnosis of the disease described as Mystery Disease, characterised in
that it comprises a preparation according to one of the claims 4 and 5 or antibodies against

such a preparation.
