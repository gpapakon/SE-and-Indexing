<ABSTRACT>
A wireless telephone system comprises: a PBX connected by a wireline to at least one base station for communicating over a radio link with mobile telephones; a unit for transmitting and receiving audio and data signals over the wireline between the PBX and the base station; a unit for transmitting and receiving audio and data signals over the radio link between the base station and a mobile telephone; and in the base station a unit for separating incoming audio and data signals channels, a unit for combining outgoing audio and data signals for onward transmission thereof from the base station, and a unit for interpreting said data signals and either acting on said data signals if they are intended for the base station or otherwise passing said signals through the base station for onward transmission to the receiving unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wireless telephone system 
comprising a PBX connected by a wireline to at least one base 
station which communicates over a radio link with mobile 
telephones. Telephone sets for connection to the PSTN (Public-Switched 
Telephone Network) which communicate by radio link with 
portable hand sets, have been available for some time. In 
office environments it is desirable to provide a PBX-based 
system operating in a similar way. The PBX is connected to the 
PSTN and communicates with mobile handsets via radio links. In 
such a system, in order to cover a wide area, the PBX is 
generally connected by wireline link to a number of base 
stations which establish a radio link with the mobile handsets. 
While telephones have been developed which employ digital 
modulation for signalling, voice and synchronization, 
currently, a means is required to interface such wireless 
handsets to the wireline network through a PBX (Private Branch 
Exchange), and an object of the invention is to provide such a 
system. EP 168,647 discloses a mobile telephone system 
comprising a switching center and a plurality of base 
stations. However, this system is intended for broad 
coverage cellular networks and is not suitable for local PBX 
environments. In this system the date and audio channels 
are digitally multiplexed for transmission to between the 
switching center and the base stations. According to the present invention there is provided a 
wireless telephone system comprising: an exchange connected by 
a wireline to at least one base station for communicating over 
a radio link with mobile telephones, means for transmitting and  
 
receiving audio and data signals over the radio link between 
the base station and a mobile telephone; and in the base 
station means for separating incoming audio and data signals, 
and means for combining outgoing audio and data signals for 
onward transmission thereof from the base station; 
characterized in that said exchange is a PBX (Private Branch 
Exchange) for connection to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone 
Network), and said means for transmitting and receiving said 
audio and data signals over the wireline comprise means for 
transmitting said audio signals as a full-duplex in-band audio 
signal and an out-of-band modulated carrier data signal, and 
said base station further comprises means for converting said  
 
in-band and out-of-band signals to respective serial audio and 
data bit streams, means for interpreting the data signals to 
determine

<CLAIMS>
A wireless telephone system comprising: an 
exchange (20) connected by a wireline (1) to at least one base 

station for communicating over a radio link with mobile 
telephones, means (12) for transmitting and receiving audio and 

data signals over the radio link between the base station 
and a mobile telephone; and in the base station means for 

separating incoming audio and data signals, and means for 
combining outgoing audio and data signals for onward 

transmission thereof from the base station; characterized in 
that said exchange is a PBX (Private Branch Exchange) for 

connection to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), 
and said means for transmitting and receiving said audio and 

data signals over the wireline comprise means (5,6,10) for 
transmitting said audio signals as a full-duplex in-band 

audio signal and an out-of-band modulated carrier data 
signal (17), and said base station further comprises means for 

converting said
 
in-band and out-of-band signals to respective serial audio 

and data bit streams, means (9) for interpreting the data 
signals to determine whether they are intended for the base 

station or the mobile telephone, and means for combining the 
audio bit stream and the data bit stream intended for the 

mobile telephone into a single bit stream for transmission 
over the radio link. 
A wireless telephone system as claimed in claim 
1, wherein said wireline is a twisted-pair two-wire line, 

and each base station comprises a two-to-four wire 
converter at the interface with said wireline. 
A wireless telephone system as claimed in claim 
1, wherein said wireline provides a dc power supply to 

each base station.  
 
A wireless telephone system as claimed in claim 
1, wherein said data signals are converted in the base 

station to a baseband bitstream that is input to a 
microprocessor acting as said interpreting means. 
A wireless telephone system as claimed in claim 
4, further comprising a UART between said wireline and 

said microprocessor. 
A wireless telephone system as claimed in claim 
4, wherein on the wireline side incoming audio signals 

are converted to a low bit rate digital format before 
being input to a multiplexer where they are combined with 

data signals from the microprocessor for onward 
transmission through an RF modulator over the radio link. 
A wireless telephone system as claimed in claim 
6, further comprising a codec and transcoder for 

converting the incoming audio signals from the PBX to 
said low bit rate digital format.
