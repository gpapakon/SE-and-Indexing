<ABSTRACT>
Pharmaceutical compositions based on Interleukin-6 (IL-6) stabilized with non reducing sugars, such as sucrose and trehalose. The compositions may also contain an amino acid or human albumin as an excipient. The formulation is particularly suitable for the stabilization of recombinant IL-6 freeze-dried powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention contemplates pharmaceutical compositions 
containing Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and particularly contemplates 
compositions based on IL-6 stabilized with nonreducing sugars. Interleukin-6 is a protein belonging to the group of cytokins, which 
proved to play a key role in the organism immune response and 
haematopoiesis stimulation (International Symposium on IL-6: 
Physiopathology and Clinical Potentials, Montreux, October 21-23, 
1991). The prospective therapeutic applications of IL-6 are tumoral growth 
inhibition, treatment of thrombocytopenia caused by chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy, and even accidental exposure to radiations. It may 
also be used as a vaccine adjuvant. According to the present invention, IL-6 may be either natural or 
synthetic, i.e. produced on the basis of recombinant DNA technology, 
the latter being preferred. The protein of this invention is glycosylated human IL-6, prepared 
on the basis of the recombinant DNA technology by expression in CHO 
(Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells, transformed with the corresponding 
DNA, according to the disclosures of European Patent Application EP 
0220574. As known, purified proteins show a great tendency to become 
denaturated, even by normal atmospheric agents. This characteristic 
is even more evident in proteins produced on the basis of 
recombinant DNA technology. To prevent any contamination of non-human  
 
origin, they must be purified to a high degree, which makes 
their stability lower than that of corresponding purified natural 
proteins. IL-6 formulations for injection are obtained on the basis of a 
process inclusive of freeze-drying for dry powder production. As described by M.J. Pikal in Biopharm., October 25-30, 1990, the 
protein pharmacological activity is reduced by phenomena taking 
place during freeze-drying. For example, proteic aggregates, which are generally regarded as 
directly responsible for the onset of allergic manifestations, 
frequently form during the process. Furthermore, should the protein 
be not damaged by the various process stresses, a partial 
denaturation of same during storage operations would be extremely 
probable. It is just because of the very easy denaturation of highly purified 
proteins that it is highly desirable to produce stable formulations 
with an as long life cycle as possible, even when stored at ambient 
temperature. The expression "formulation stability" is used to mean that the 
protein maintains its activity both during the pharmaceutical 
preparation and storage. The
