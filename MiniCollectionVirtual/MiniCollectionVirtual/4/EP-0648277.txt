<CLAIMS>
Microbial esterase, wherein it enantioselectively 
cleaves (S)-1-phenylethyl acetate and is obtainable 

from Arthrobacter spec. (DSM 7034) or Pseudomonsas 
fluorescens (DSM 7033). 
Microbial esterase as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
is is obtainable from Arthrobacter spec. 

(DSM 7034). 
Process for the isolation of a microbial esterase 
which enantioselectively cleaves (S)-1-phenylethyl 

acetate, wherein a cell lysate from Arthrobacter 
spec. (DSM 7034) or Pseudomonas fluorescens (DSM 

7033) is treated with a soluble ion exchanger and 
the esterase is isolated and purified from the 

solution treated in this manner by hydrophobic 
chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. 
Arthrobacter spec. DSM 7034. 
Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 7033. 
Process for the enantioselective cleavage of a 
1-arylalkyl ester of formula IV, 


 
in which R1 denotes an aryl or substituted aryl  

 
residue and R2 and R3 denote an alkyl or 

substituted alkyl residue, wherein a racemic 
mixture of this ester is treated with a microbial 

esterase as claimed in claim 1 in an aqueous buffer 
at a pH value of 5-10 and at a temperature of 5°C - 

50°C. 
Process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the ester is 
treated with the microbial esterase at a pH value 

of 6-9 and at a temperature of 20°C - 40°C. 
Process for the production of a 1-arylalkanol 
according to formula III, 


 
in which R1 denotes an aryl or substituted aryl 

residue and R2 denotes an alkyl or substituted 
alkyl residue, wherein a racemic mixture of a 

1-arylalkyl ester is treated with a microbial 
esterase as claimed in claim 1 in an aqueous buffer 

at a pH value of 5-10 and at a temperature of 5°C - 
50°C and subsequently the 1-arylalkanol obtained is 

isolated. 
Process as claimed in claim 8, wherein the 
1-arylalkyl ester is treated with the microbial 

esterase at a pH value of 6-9 and at a temperature 
of 20°C - 40°C.
