<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a new range of application of human
Protein C.Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent protein that is synthesized
in the liver and circulates as an inactive zymogen in a
concentration of 4 mg/l. It is transformed by the thrombin-thrombomodulin
complex into the active serine protease
(activated Protein C) on the vessel wall surface (endothelium).
It is known that activated Protein C has profibrinolytic
properties. It also has anticoagulatory effects because it
inactivates Factor Va, the co-factor for the Factor Xa-induced
prothrombin activation (thrombin formation), and Factor VIIIa,
the co-factor for Factor IXa-induced Factor X activation, by
proteolysis.The activation of Protein C in vivo constitutes a negative
feedback reaction of thrombin generation. In order to develop
optimal biological activity, a co-factor (Protein S) is
necessary.In the European patent application EP 0 406 216 a
pharmaceutical preparation is described which contains Protein
S, optionally, in combination with activated Protein C, and can
be employed for the treatment or prevention of thrombosis and
thrombo-embolic complications.According to EP 0 519 900 the use of a Protein C-containing
pharmaceutical preparation together with a thrombolytically
effective substance for the treatment of thrombosis and for the
prevention of re-occlusion is possible. It was found that 
during the thrombolysis therapy a deficiency of Protein C
results wherefore the substitution with Protein C is
recommended.The effect of the inactive zymogen of Protein C differs
fundamentally from the active enzyme, activated Protein C.Activated Protein C enables the prevention of arterial
thrombosis or stenosis, preferably in combination with a
thrombolytically effective agent (tissue plasminogen activator,
tPA); for this, see EP 0 318 201.It is also known that in blood platelet-enriched plasma (PRP)
activated Protein C suppresses platelet aggregation which is
induced by thrombin activation. However, a higher
concentration of activated Protein C leads to an opposite
effect, namely to the aggregation of the blood platelets (E.N.
Santander et al., Acta Physiologica Latino-Americana 33 (2),
1983).Activated or stimulated blood platelets possess the
glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex which functions as a receptor for
various adhesion molecules. Among the adhesion proteins that
bind to GP IIb-IIIa of stimulated blood platelets are
fibrinogen, von Willebrand Factor, and fibronectin. It is
supposed that a tri-peptide sequence, namely Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD),
