<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to heat-sealable polypropylene films having an improved water vapour barrier action, having the layer structure ABCBA, where   a) C, the base layer, comprises highly isotactic polypropylene which has an isotacticity of 
>
 94% and is hydrocarbon resin with a molecular weight of up to about 2000 g/mol and a softening point of above 130@C, b) B are two hydrocarbon resin-free jacket layers of highly isotactic polypropylene having an isotacticity of 
>
 94%, where the ratio between the thickness of the jacket layer and the thickness of the base layer is between 0.01 and 0.1, and c) A are two top layers of a heat-sealable polyolefin homopolymer, copolymer or terpolymer, where these top layers contain at least one antiblocking agent, lubricant and antistatic.

<CLAIMS>
An oriented, in particular biaxially oriented,
sealable polypropylene film having an improved

barrier action to water vapour, characterized in that
it has the following structure:

   A B C B A

a) wherein C is a base layer of highly isotactic
polypropylene having an isotacticity of 
>
94% and
a hydrocarbon resin having a molecular weight of

up to about 2,000 g/mol and a softening point
above 130°C,
b) wherein B represents two jacket layers, which
are free from hydrocarbon resin, of highly

isotactic polypropylene having an isotacticity
of 
>
94%, the ratio of the thickness of the
jacket layer to the thickness of the base layer

being between 0.01 and 0.1, and
c) wherein A represents two surface layers of a
heat-sealable polyolefin, homo-, co- or

terpolymer, said surface layers comprising at

least one antiblocking agent, a lubricant and an
antistatic agent.
A sealable film according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the base layer comprises a hydrocarbon resin

from the group consisting of petroleum resins,
terpene resins or coal tar resins. 
A sealable film according to claim 2, characterized in
that the hydrocarbon resin is a hydrogenated

oligomeric cyclopentadiene resin.
A sealable film according to claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the surface layers substantially

comprise

a random propylene/ethylene copolymer
a random propylene/1-butene copolymer
a random propylene/ethylene/olefin terpolymer
mixtures of two or three of the above polymers.
A sealable film according to claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the surface layers comprise

silicon dioxide, calcium carbonate, polymethyl
methacrylate, polycarbonate, silicone or HDPE (high-density

polyethylene) as the antiblocking agent.
A sealable film according to claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the base layer and/or the

surface layers comprise a lubricant.
A sealable film according to claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the base layer and/or the

surface layers comprise an antistatic agent.
A film according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that it is pretreated on one or both sides by

corona, flame, plasma or fluorine pretreatment. 
Use of the sealable film according to one or more of
claims 1 to 8 as a packaging material.
