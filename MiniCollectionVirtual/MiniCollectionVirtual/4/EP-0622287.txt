<ABSTRACT>
A device in which a pressure protection flap 3 is provided in an inflow or outflow opening 2, which pressure protection flap 3 can be opened and closed by means of a control device which comprises a pressure measuring device 8 and a computer 5 and outputs an opening and closing instruction when two pressure values exceed a predetermined difference value. Here, a device is aimed at which both determines the triggering pressure difference value from two measured pressure values and is also independent of the follow-on behaviour of the internal pressure after the external pressure. This is achieved in that the difference value which triggers the opening or closing instruction is a measured 8 pressure gradient which is the difference between two pressure values which are measured at different times with respect to the same measurement point 9 of the rail vehicle. The invention provides a pressure limitation with pressure protection flaps in inflow openings and outflow openings which are closed or opened as a function of the pressure gradient which is measured inside the vehicle or at its external wall.

<CLAIMS>
A device for pressure limitation in high-speed rail vehicles, wherein 
a pressure protection valve (3) is provided in an air inlet or outlet 

opening (2) and is openable and closable by means of a control 
device comprising a pressure meter (8) and a computer (5) and 

giving an opening or closing command when a predetermined 
differential value of two pressure values is exceeded, and wherein 

the differential value triggering the opening or closing command is 
a measured (8) pressure gradient being the difference between 

two pressure values measured at different times at the same 
measuring point (9) of the rail vehicle, characterised in that sensing 

ends of pressure lines (11, 12) of different lengths are provided at 
the measuring point (9), the pressure lines (11, 12) being 

connected at the other end to two inputs of a differential pressure 

sensor (8) which detects a pressure change at the measuring point 
at its two inputs at different times, and the pressure gradient is in 

each case determined by the pressure values detected 
simultaneously at the two inputs.
