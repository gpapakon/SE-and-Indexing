<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an anti-skid device for footwear in the form of spikes (12, 13), said spikes arranged to be displaced backwards and forwards from an inactive position in or interiorly of the undersole (5) of a shoe, out through an opening (14, 15) formed in the undersole (5) and to an active anti-skid position on the lower face of the undersole (5). The anti-skid device comprises a threaded rotary rod (1a, 1b) extending in the longitudinal direction of the undersole (5). The rod is in threaded engagement with a sliding member (3, 4) which is displaceable backwards and forwards in the longitudinal direction of the undersole (5) and which is hingedly connected to a support element (10, 11) supporting the spikes (12, 13), said spikes projecting from the support element (10, 11) in the direction of movement of the latter. The rotary rod (1a, 1b) is arranged, upon rotation in one sense, to displace the sliding member (3, 4) in one direction lengthwise with respect to the undersole (5) to bring said member to displace the spikes (12, 13) out through the opening (14, 15) in the sole to the anti-skid position. Upon rotation in the opposite sense the slide member (4, 5) is displaced in the opposite direction and retracts the spikes (12, 13) through the opening (14, 15) back into the inactive position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention concerns an anti-skid device 
for footwear in the form of spikes. The spikes are 
arranged to be displaced from an inactive position in or 
interiorly of the undersole of a shoe, out through an 
opening formed in the undersole and to an active anti-skid 
position on the lower face of the undersole, and reversely 
back into the retracted position inside the latter. Various types of anti-skid device are known. The 
feature common to all of them is that they are comparatively 
difficult to reach and that in order to manipulate 
them it is necessary to stand on one foot at a time to 
pull out or otherwise shift the anti-skid device to the 
active position. For the purpose of facilitating manipulation of the 
anti-skid device a construction, described in the Swedish 
Patent SE-B-467 133, has been developed. This document discloses a slip protection for footwear having rotary 
rods fitted crossways to the footwear bottom sole, which rods are provided 
with a number of projecting spikes. An operating rod is fitted in the 
footwear's longitudinal direction in threaded engagement with the 
rotary rods, enabling the spikes to emerge from their location holes 
to form slip protection on the botton sole underside. By reverse 
rotation of the operating rod, the spikes can be withdrawn through their 
holes, back into the bottom sole.  
 
This construction 
which has the advantage of allowing pull-out or retraction 
of two anti-skid means at the same time, one at the rear 
and one at the front of the undersole of a shoe, by means 
of one single control member, does, however, suffer from 
the disadvantage of insufficient strength. Because the 
structural components of the device cannot be given the 
desired dimensions on account of the limited space at the 
disposal in a shoe, this prior-art construction has a 
tendency to frequent malfunctioning. The subject invention provides an anti-skid device 
which functions in an extremely reliable manner while at 
the same time it offers the wearer excellent protection on 
slippery surfaces. The characterizing features of this 
anti-skid device appear from the subsequent claims. The invention will be described in closer detail in 
the following with reference to the accompanying drawings, 
wherein  
 
Fig. 1 illustrates the anti-skid device in accordance 
with the invention in an exploded view, Fig. 2 illustrates the anti-skid device in a view 
from below, Fig. 3 is a longitudinal sectional view through the 
device in the inner, retracted position, and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An anti-skid device for footwear in the form of 
spikes (12, 13), said spikes arranged to be displaced from 

an inactive position in or interiorly of the undersole (5) 
of footwear, ou
t through an opening (14, 15) formed in the 
footwear undersole (5) and to an active anti-skid position 

on the lower face of the undersole (5), and reversely, 
back into the retracted position inside the undersole (5),
 
   characterized in that the anti-skid device 

comprises a threaded rotary rod (1a, 1b) extending in the 
longitudinal direction of the undersole (5) and being in 

threaded engagement with a sliding member (3, 4) arranged 
for displacement backwards and forwards in the longitudinal 

direction of the undersole (5), said sliding 
member (3, 4) being hingedly connected to a support 

element (10, 11) supporting the spikes (12, 13) and moving 
together with said sliding member (3, 4), said spikes 

(12, 13) projecting from the spike-support element 
(10, 11) in the direction of movement of the latter, and 

in that the rotary rod (1a, 1b) is arranged, upon rotation 
in one sense, to displace the sliding member (3, 4) in one 

direction longitudinally with respect to the undersole (5) 
for displacement of the spikes (12, 13) out through the 

opening (14, 15) in the undersole (5) to said anti-skid 
position and, upon rotation in the opposite sense, to 

displace the sliding member (3, 4) in the opposite 
direction, for retraction of the spikes (12, 13) through 

the opening (14, 15) and back into said inactive position. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the element supporting the spikes 

(12, 13) is a curved plate (10, 11), said plate being 
hingedly connected to the slide member (3, 4) and being 

moved by the slide member (3, 4) so as to follow a track 
which curves downwards through the undersole (5) from the 

path of movement of the slide member (3, 4) and then 
merges into the opening (14, 15) formed in the undersole 

(5), and in that the spikes (12, 13) are mounted on the  
 

free lateral edge of the plate (10, 11). 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the rotary rod 
(1a, 1b) is provided with a gear drive (21), said gear 

drive being connected to a gear mechanism (22). 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the rotary rod 
(1a, 1b) is driven by an electric motor (24).
