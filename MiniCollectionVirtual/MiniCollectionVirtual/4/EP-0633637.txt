<ABSTRACT>
The plug (1) has a layer (13) of fluorocarbon polymer 
on the surfaces (11) of the insulating element (3) 

which are directly exposed to the atmosphere near the 
central electrode (4) and/or which face the outer 

tubular metal body (2) so as to prevent the insulating 
element (3) from being fouled by carbon residues.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to spark plugs for 
internal combusion engines with controlled ignition. More specifically, the invention relates to a spark 
plug of the type comprising:
 
an outer tubular metal body,
 
a tubular insulating element disposed in the body,
 
a central electrode which extends through the 
insulating element and projects axially beyond the end 
of the insulating element which faces the combustion 
chamber in use, and
 
at least one earth electrode which extends from the 
outer metal body towards the side surface of the 
portion of the central electrode which projects from 
the insulator. An object of the invention is to provide a spark plug 
of the type specified above which prevents the 
deposition of carbon particles on the end of the 
ceramic insulating element. As it is known, conventional spark plugs are subjected to 
very heavy use during the movement of the motor 
vehicles in which they are fitted in storage yards and, 
in general, during the short movements necessary to 
transport the motor vehicles from the place of 
construction to the commercial network, and this may 
lead to the insulator of the plug being fouled with 
carbon substances which may short-circuit the central 
electrode to the outer metal body with the result that 
it is impossibile to obtain useful sparks.  The object of the present invention is to provide a 
spark plug for internal combustion engines with 
controlled ignition which is highly resistant to 
fouling during the pre-sale life of the motor-vehicle 
in which it is mounted. This object is achieved, according to the invention, by 
means of a spark plug for internal combustion engines 
with controlled ignition having the specific 
characteristics recited in the following claims. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention 
will become clear from the detailed description which 
follows with reference to the appended drawing provided 
purely by way of non-limiting example, in which a spark 
plug, partially sectioned along its longitudinal 
centreline is generally indicated 1. The plug 1 comprises, in known manner, an outer tubular 
metal body 2, a portion 2' of which is threaded 
externally. A substantially tubular element 3 of electrically 
insulating material, typically ceramic material, is 
disposed in the body 2, in known manner. An end portion 3a of the insulating element 3 projects 
axially beyond the end of the metal body 2 which faces 
the combustion chamber in use. A central electrode, indicated 4, extends through a 
portion
