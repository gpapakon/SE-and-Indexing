<ABSTRACT>
A variety of Brassica napus, designated AG019, and varieties essentially derived 
therefrom, having oil which combines oxidative stability sufficient for industrial 

applications with a desirable dietary fatty acid profile. Plants, seeds, tissue cultures, and 
plants regenerated from tissue cultures. Oil having an oleic acid content of from about 

71.4% to about 77.4%, a linolenic acid content of no more than about 3%, an 
oleic:linolenic acid ratio value of at least about 34.0, and an (oleic+linoleic)/linolenic 

acid ratio value of at least about 41.2. The oil has substantially improved oxidative 
stability, relatively to normal rapeseed oil, when both are identically treated with 

antioxidant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a variety of Brassica napus, and to oil obtained from seed
of that variety.More particularly, the present invention is directed to a variety of Brassica napus
designated AG019, which produces seed containing about 71-78% oleic acid and no more
than about 3 % linolenic acid in the seed oil. The oil has improved responsiveness to
antioxidants over standard Canola oil, and is useful in food and industrial applications.Over 13% of the world's supply of edible oil in 1985 was produced from the
oilseed crop species Brassica, commonly known as rapeseed or mustard. Brassica is the
third most important source of edible oil, ranking behind only soybean and palm.
Because Brassica is able to germinate and grow at relatively low temperatures, it is also
one of the few commercially important edible oilseed crops which can be cultivated in
cooler agricultural regions, as well as serving as a winter crop in more temperate zones.
Moreover, vegetable oils in general, and rapeseed oil in particular, are gaining increasing
consideration for use in industrial applications because they have the potential to provide
performance comparable to that of synthetic or mineral/naphthenic-based oils with the
very desirable advantage of also being biodegradable.The performance characteristics, whether dietary or industrial, of a vegetable oil
are substantially determined by its fatty acid profile, that is, by the species of fatty acids
present in the oil and the relative and absolute amounts of each species. While several
relationships between fatty acid profile and performance characteristics are known, many 
remain uncertain. Notwithstanding, the type and amount of unsaturation present in a
vegetable oil have implications for both dietary and industrial applications.Vegetable oils are subject to oxidative degradation, which can detract from the
lubricity and viscosity characteristics of the oil as well as cause changes in color and odor
perceived as undesirable. Color and odor are obviously of particular concern in food
applications, where the autoxidation of vegetable oils, and the accompanying deterioration
of flavor, is referred to as rancidity. The rate of oxidation is affected by several factors,
including the presence of oxygen, exposure to light and heat, and the presence of native
or added antioxidants and prooxidants in the oil. However, of most pertinence to the
present invention, and perhaps generally, is the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids in
the oil.The fatty acids present in
