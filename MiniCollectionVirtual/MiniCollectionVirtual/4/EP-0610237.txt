<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method in connection with a roof drainage apparatus and a roof drainage apparatus. The invention comprises a trough (2) recessed in a roof structure (1), an opening (3) arranged in the bottom of the trough, a water-outlet tube (4) joined to the opening and a means (5) for changing an open water flow into a closed flow when the water flow is increasing. For intensifying the drainage, an element (6) is positioned in the water-outlet tube (4) at a throat after the opening (3), by means of which element the cross-sectional area of the water-outlet tube (4) is regulated in such a manner that the shape of the cross-section of the water-outlet tube (4) remains substantially unchanged at the regulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of controlling water flow from a roof
drainage apparatus of the type in which an increase in water flow causes the
water flow to change from an open flow, into a closed flow in which water is
directed through an opening in the bottom of a trough recessed in a roof
structure, into a water-outlet passage, including a water-outlet tube, disposed
downstream of the opening. The invention also relates to a roof drainage
apparatus of this type. Such a method and apparatus are defined, respectively,
in the precharacterising clauses of claims 1 and 4.Such apparatus is well-known, for example from Finnish Patent 70446.
In this apparatus, the opening is arranged directly at roof level. The means for
changing open flow into closed flow comprises a plate positioned above the
opening, the size of the plate and its height above the roof level being
dimensioned according to criteria causing closed flow.Another example of prior apparatus is disclosed in Finnish Patent 75394.
This apparatus utilizes the same basic principle for causing closed flow as the
apparatus according to Finnish Patent 70446. However, in the apparatus
according to Finnish Patent 75394, the opening is arranged in a trough
recessed in the roof structure and not directly at roof level as in Finnish Patent
70446 mentioned above.The above-mentioned apparatus work very well in principle, but
drawbacks have nevertheless been observed especially in connection with large
roofs provided with several roof outlets joined to the same tube system. These
drawbacks are due to the fact that it is difficult to provide separate roof outlet
branches with correct flow resistances. In the event that the separate roof
outlet branches cannot be provided with correct flow resistance, the system
does not function in the best possible manner, and in the worst case, the
system does not function at all. An additional inconvenience is that tubes of
different diameters are available only to a relatively restricted extent, and it is
therefore often necessary in practice to make compromises when choosing
tubes. Further inconveniences are caused by the fact that it has not been 
possible to regulate the flow resistances of the separate roof outlet branches
after the installation of the tube system. It should be note that the system is
rather sensitive to blockages caused by impurities, so that flaps or the like of
whatever kind cannot be used, if a reliable functioning of the system is desired
in all circumstances.The object of the invention is to

A method of controlling the flow of water in a roof drainage apparatus
of the type in which an increase in water flow causes the water flow to

change, from an open flow, into a closed flow in which the water is directed
through an outlet opening (3, 13) in the bottom of a trough (2, 12) recessed

in a roof structure (1), into a water-outlet passage, including a water-outlet
tube (4, 14), disposed downstream of the outlet opening (3, 13), the method

being characterised by:

providing a throat portion (6, 16, 26, 36a, 36b, 46) in the water-outlet
passage downstream of the outlet opening (3, 13), which defines a throttle

opening in the water-outlet passage intermediate the outlet opening and water-outlet
tube (4, 14); and
changing the cross-sectional area of the throttle opening without
substantially changing the cross-sectional shape of the throttle opening,

thereby to regulate the water flow through the water-outlet passage.
A method according to claim 1, which includes:

providing a throat portion comprising a elastically deformable annular
element (6, 16, 26, 36a); and
moving a compression member (7), mounted in the water-outlet passage,
in an axial direction relative to the water-outlet passage while in contact with

the annular element to adjust the compressive deformation and therefore the
internal diameter of the annular element, thereby to change the cross-sectional

area of the throttle opening defined by the annular element.
A method according to claim 1, which includes changing the cross-sectional
area of the throttle opening defined by the throat portion by detaching

an annular element (46) which comprises the throat portion, and replacing it by
another annular element (46) having a different internal diameter throttle

opening.
A roof drainage apparatus, comprising a trough (2, 12) recessed in a roof
structure (1), an outlet opening (3, 13) arranged in the bottom of the trough,

a water-outlet passage, including a water-outlet tube (4, 14), disposed 
downstream of and joined to the opening, and means (5) for changing the flow

of water from an open flow, into a closed flow when the water flow increases,
characterised by a throat element (6, 16, 26, 36a, 36b, 46) provided in the

water-outlet passage downstream of the outlet opening (3, 13), which defines
a throttle opening in the water-outlet passage intermediate the outlet opening

and water-outlet tube (4, 14), the cross-sectional area of the throttle opening
being changeable without substantially changing the cross-sectional shape of

the throttle opening, thereby to regulate the water flow through the water-outlet
passage.
A roof drainage apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the throat
element (6, 16, 26, 36a, 36b, 46) extends around the whole perimeter of the

inner surface of the water-outlet passage and is operable to throttle the water-outlet
passage around its whole perimeter.
A roof drainage apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, wherein the throat
element (6, 16, 26, 36a, 36b) comprises annular means defining a throttle

opening arranged to become larger or smaller depending on the regulating
direction.
A roof drainage apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the annular
means is a part made of an elastic material.
A roof drainage apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the part of
elastic material is arranged to widen inwards upon axial compression and

thereby throttle the cross-sectional area of the water-outlet tube (4, 14).
A roof drainage apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the annular
means is a spring element.
A roof drainage apparatus according to claim 4 or 6, wherein the element
is a part (46) to be chosen according to the required cross-sectional area for
