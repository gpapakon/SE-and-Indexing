<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a pressure-relief valve for use in lubrication systems, the valve being designed to avoid overtravel, i.e., the occurrence of a surge, on opening and closing. The valve has a housing (8) with a valve seat (10) which operates in conjunction with an obturation element (12). The obturation element surface (13) facing the valve seat (10) is curved. The curved surface of the obturation element (12) is designed to be larger than the valve seat (10) so that the curved surface (13) extends beyond the rim of the valve seat (10). This gives improved control over the stream of fluid passing through the valve.

<CLAIMS>
A valve with a casing (8), a valve seat (10) with an inlet 
(25) and with an outlet (18) connected to the valve seat (10), a 

prestressed valve body (12) lying opposite the valve seat (10), 
whose surface (13) cooperating with the valve seat (10) is formed 

so as not be planar and bears in the closed position on the valve 
seat (10) in such a way that a portion (23) of the surface (13) 

projects towards the outlet (18), and with means (19, 22) provided 
on the outlet side of the valve seat for obtaining a predetermined 

throttling action, characterized in that the outlet 
(18) has an outlet opening (19) and a recess (22) arranged ahead 

of the outlet and lying on the side remote from the valve body 
(12), in which arrangement the predetermined throttling action is 

obtained by the recess (22) and/or the dimensioning of the diameter 
of the outlet opening (19), and in which arrangement the 

reach of the recess (22) in the radial direction corresponds to 
the size of the projecting portion (23). 
A valve according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
outlet (18) has an outlet opening (19) whose diameter is chosen 

to be so small that the predetermined throttling action is obtained. 
A valve according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
recess (22) is designed as an annular space. 
A valve according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that in the closed position, the ratio of the reach of the projecting 

portion (23) to the internal part amounts in projection 
to approximately 1/3 to 2/3. 
A valve according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the face of the valve seat (10) lying opposite the valve 

body (12) has an edge bearing on the latter in the closed position.  
 
A valve according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the surface (13) as a concave or convex shape (7). 
A valve according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the axial section of the surface (13) has a hyperbolic or 

triangular shape. 
A valve according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the surface (13) has a spherical central section and a 

conical section surrounding the latter.
