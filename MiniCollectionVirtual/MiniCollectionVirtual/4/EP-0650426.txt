<ABSTRACT>
Following a general trend, the present invention proposes an anti-lock hydraulic braking system in which a braking force regulator has also been included. Unlike the prior art systems, the braking force regulator (21) used here, however, is blocked only when the pump (18) builds up pressure. This means that the braking force regulator (21) exerts its pressure reducing function at every uncritical brake application as soon as its changeover pressure is reached. This provides the advantage over other braking regulators which are actuated only when the anti-lock fails that the seizing or clamping of functional components of the regulator is prevented and slip control will be needed on fewer occasions.

Anti-lock hydraulic brake system for use with a dual-axle 
automotive vehicle, comprising 


a pedal-operated master brake cylinder (1) in communication 
with a pressure fluid reservoir (2), 
a brake conduit (3,5) leading to at least one rear-wheel brake 
(11), 
an outlet conduit (13) leading from the rear-wheel brake (11) 
to a pressure fluid reservoir (16), 
a pump (18) delivering pressure fluid from the pressure fluid 
reservoir (16) into the brake conduit (3) for anti-lock 

control, 
an electromagnetically actuated inlet valve (7) open in deenergized 
condition and provided in the brake conduit (5) and 

an electromagnetically actuated outlet valve (15) closed in 
de-energized condition and provided in the outlet conduit 

(13), and 
a brake force controller (21) in the brake conduit (5) 
including a valve (39,38), wherein a blocking piston (48) is 

acted upon in the opening direction of the valve (39,38) and 
moves the valve closure member of the valve (39,38) by way of 

a plunger (42), 
 
characterized in that the pressure-reducing function of the 

brake force controller (5) can be deactivated by the blocking 
piston (48), and in that the blocking piston (48) is acted 

upon hydraulically by the outlet pressure of the pump (18) in 
the opening direction of the valve (38,39) and by a resetting 

spring (49) and the pressure in the rear-wheel brake (11) in 
the closing direction of the valve (39,38).  

 
Anti-lock hydraulic brake system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the brake force controller (21) is 

located directly ahead of the wheel brake (11), i.e. between 
the wheel brake (11), on the one hand, and the inlet valve (7) 

and outlet valve (15), on the other hand. 
Anti-lock hydraulic brake system as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2,
 
characterized in that the brake force controller (21) is of 

the in-screw type having three pressure fluid connections 
(30,31,32), two of which are in coaxial and one in radial 

relationship, and that all three connections are provided with 
a thread.
