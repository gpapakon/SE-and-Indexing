<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a vitreous-bonded abrasive 
grinding wheel wherein the abrasive grit portion comprises a 

sol-gel alumina abrasive and wherein the wheel has improved 
corner or form holding characteristics and mechanical 

properties. The invention further includes the bond 
composition which allows for improved corner or form holding 

and mechanical properties with sol-gel alumina abrasives.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to U.S. Patent Nos. 5,035,723
issued July 30th, 1991 and 5,203,886 issued April 20th, 1993.The invention relates to abrasive wheels particularly
abrasive wheels containing sol-gel alumina abrasive grit with
improved corner holding properties. The invention further
includes a bond composition which allows for improved
mechanical strength and improved corner holding properties.Precision moving parts are being designed to run at
higher outputs, higher efficiencies and longer service. These
parts are for example engines (internal combustion, jet &
electric), drive trains (transmissions & differentials), and
bearing surfaces. In order to meet these demands, the parts
must be produced with improved quality including
better/stronger designs with tighter dimensional tolerances.
To achieve these tolerances, the parts are being produced with
better quality materials to near net or final shape and size.Grinding wheels are often utilized for fabrication of the
entire part or to impart the final dimensions. Vitreous or
glass bonded grinding wheels are the wheels utilized most on
metal parts. In order to produce these types of precision 
parts with a grinding wheel, the reverse image of the part is
"dressed" into the wheel face with a diamond tool. Because
the part being manufactured takes the profile of the grinding
wheel, it is important that the grinding wheel retain that
shape as long as possible. The ideal situation would then be
to produce the precision parts with exact dimensional
tolerances and with no material damage.Typically, the grinding wheels fall out of shape or fail
at a corner or a curve in the wheel. Standard fused alumina
abrasive products may last through the grinding of two or
three pieces before a significant change occurs in the corner
of the wheel. Hence, the operators of the grinding machines
may set up dressing of the wheel after every piece to avoid
defects. With wheels produced using higher performing sol-gel
alumina abrasive grits, the shape change in the corner of the
wheel may not appear until after grinding four or five pieces
and the operators of the grinding machines may plan on
dressing these wheels after grinding three pieces. While the
dressing frequency reduction characteristic of sol-gel alumina
wheels is an improvement over standard abrasive wheels, the
dressing frequency and the loss of the sol-gel alumina wheel
through dressing make further gains in dressing frequency
reduction a desirable goal.What is needed is a better corner or form holding
