<DESCRIPTION>
 CONTAINERThe invention relates to a container and in particular to a container having restraining means to restrain a load of goods from moving within the container. It is known to locate a beam to bridge the opposite inside side walls of the goods compartment, the ends of the beam being releasably connected to vertical tracks on the opposite inside surfaces.GB-A-1196052 discloses a device in which a post carrying a bearer board has means to enable the post to be snapped into longitudinal or transverse rails secured to the sides, floor or roof of a container, the bearer board being urged by spring pressure against a load carried in the container.GB-A-2022524 discloses a container whose sides each carry an apertured top track and an apertured bottom track. Apertured vertical members extend between the top and bottom tracks and a cargo-retaining member can extend across the container being located at each end in a vertical member.There are, nevertheless, still problems where the position of a track does not coincide with the position of the load. It is an object of this invention, therefore, to provide a container adapted to solve those problems. 

Accordingly the invention provides a container having opposite side walls, track means being present on the inner surface of each side wall, the track means comprising at least one track portion extending horizontally along the length of the side wall and at least one track portion extending vertically along the height of the side wall and intersecting a horizontal track portion, beam means extending between the opposite side walls, connecting means being present at each end of the beam means to connect the beam means to a track portion on each side wall, the beam means being movable along both the horizontal and vertical track portions, wherein rotary means are present at the intersection of a horizontal track portion and vertical track portion, the rotary means being adapted to engage the beam means and being movable between one position in alignment with the vertical track portion and another position in alignment with a horizontal track portion to enable the beam means to move between a vertical track portion and a horizontal track portion.Preferably complementary engaging means are present on the rotary means and each track portion.Advantageously a releasable catch is present to lock the rotary means in alignment with either track portion. Preferably the catch comprises a spring biased plunger mounted in the rotary means and receivable in a socket

 CLAIMS
1. A container having opposite side walls (W), track means (H,V) being present on the inner surface of each side wall (W) , the track means comprising at least one track portion (H) extending horizontally along the length of the side wall and at least one track portion (V) extending vertically along the height of the side wall and intersecting a horizontal track portion (H), beam means (B) extending between the opposite side walls (W), connecting means (10,12) being present at each end of the beam means (B) to connect the beam means to a track portion on each side wall (W), the beam means (B) being movable along both the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) track portions wherein rotary means (T) are present at the intersection of a horizontal track portion (H) and vertical track portion (V), the rotary means (T) being adapted to engage the beam means (B) and being movable from one position in alignment with the vertical track portion (V) and another position in alignment with a horizontal track portion (H) to enable the beam means (B) to move between a vertical track portion (V) and a horizontal track portion (H).
2. A container according to Claim 1, wherein complementary 


 engaging means are present on the rotary means (T) and each track portion (H,V).
3. A container according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein releasable catch means (10,12) are present to lock the rotary means (T) in alignment with either track portion.
4. A container according to Claim 3, wherein the catch comprises a spring biased plunger (10) mounted in the rotary means (T) and receivable in a socket (12) therefor in the adjacent portion of each track portion.
5. A container according to any preceding Claim, wherein the rotary means (T) is arranged to rotate through about 90Â° only.
6. A container according to Claim 5, wherein the end of each track portion (H,V) adjacent to the rotary means (T) includes stop means (15) to limit the rotation of the rotary means.
7. A container according to any preceding Claim, wherein a plurality of vertical track portions (V) and/or horizontal track portions (H) is present on the inside walls.
8. A container according to any preceding Claim, wherein the 


 -, 
Q
connecting means (C)
'
 are pivotally connected to the beam means (B).
9. A container according to any preceding Claim, wherein the track portions (H,V) are of rail form having a generally T section head (1) and the connecting means (C) including a socket (21) of complementary shape.
10. A container according to Claim 9, wherein releasable locking means are housed within the socket (21) to engage the connecting means (C) and the rail of a track portion.
11. A container according to any preceding Claim, wherein the components are made of stainless steel, aluminium or the like.
12. A container according to any preceding Claim, comprising the goods compartment of a vehicle.
