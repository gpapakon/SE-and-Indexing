<ABSTRACT>
1. A back sheet (10) for knapsacks and similar 
articles is provided with or formed by a fabric (20) 

capable of allowing the user's transpiration 
therethrough. The fabric (20) comprises a front face or 

"right side" (21) and an opposing face or "reverse side" 
(23), both made up by polyester in a weft and chain-stitch 

arrangement, and an interposed "nap" layer (25) 
formed by a single polyester yarn joining the two faces 

of said fabric (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved back 
sheet for knapsacks and similar articles, with the 
improvement consisting in that such back is provided 
and/or formed by a fabric allowing for the user's 
transpiration therethrough. An existing known problem of the items normally 
carried in contact with the body is that of allowing a 
proper transpiration to the user, e. g. through the 
backs of knapsacks and similar shoulder articles. In the past attempts have been made to solve such 
transpiration problem for knapsacks or rucksacks by 
using a more or less rigid framework fixed to the back 
sheet of the knapsack which would allow transpiration by 
maintaining the sack spaced from the user's back. Such solution has drawbacks that are not discussed 
here, since in general said solution is suitable only 
for rucksacks and packs carried by hikers, but would be 
rather unpractical for knapsacks or similar back sacks 
for citizen and/or school use to which the present 
invention is directed. In sacks to be used in metropolitan areas, for 
carrying school books or other items, waist-pouches and 
the like, a solution to the above problem is still 
needed: therefore it remains the drawback of a proper 
transpiration which is not allowed to the user by the 
known sacks or pouches. The object of the present invention is to overcome 
said drawbacks by providing a back sheet or layer for 
knapsacks and similar articles which is provided with 
and/or formed by a fabric allowing user's transpiration  
 
therethrough. The back sheet of knapsacks or similar articles of 
the present invention is characterized in that it is 
provided with or formed by a fabric capable of allowing 
the user transpiration therethrough; said fabric 
comprising a front face or "right side", an opposing 
face or "reverse side", and a "nap" layer interposed 
between said two faces. More particularly, the face forming the "right 
side" comprises a polyester in weft and chain-stitch 
arrangement, and also the face forming the "reverse" is 
made up by a polyester in weft and chain-stitch 
arrangement, while the "nap" layer interposed between 
said two faces is formed by a single polyester yarn 
joining the two faces of the fabric. A further basic characteristic of the fabric 
consists in that the single-filament yarn forming the 
"nap" is matted between the two faces in such a manner 
as to provide intermediate spaces through which air can 
flow freely; at the same time the mat is so formed that 
the fabric has a good stability. The
