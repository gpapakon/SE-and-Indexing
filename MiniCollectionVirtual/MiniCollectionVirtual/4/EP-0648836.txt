<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to transacting proteins which are
essential for the general control of vertebrate MHC class II
gene expression, to DNA sequences encoding same and to
substances which are capable of inhibiting the synthesis of
said proteins. Furthermore, the invention relates to
corresponding recombinant DNA molecules, transformed
microorganisms and their use for the production of said
proteins. The invention additionally relates to
pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of diseases
which are associated with an impaired or aberrant expression
of MHC class II genes.Class II major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens are
heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins. Their expression
at the surface of antigen-presenting cells is essential for
the recognition of foreign antigens by the T cell receptor.
T cell activation and antigen presentation depend on the
level of expression of class II antigens on individual cells.
Regulation of expression of class II genes is therefore an
important aspect of the control of both normal and abnormal
immune responses.In humans, the genes encoding the a and b chains of the HLA-DP,
HLA-DQ and HLA-DR class II molecules are clustered in the
D region of the MHC on chromosome 6. These genes are
subjected to tight and complex regulatory controls. Their
expression is generally coordinated, and restricted primarily
to cells of the immune system such as B lymphocytes,
activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and
certain specialized cells such as Kupffer cells and 
Langerhans cells. In certain class II negative cells,
expression can be induced by stimulation with lymphokines
such as interferon c or interleukin 4.MHC class II genes represent a particularly complex case of
regulated gene expression. Since presentation of foreign
antigens to helper T cells as well as thymic education of T
lymphocytes require normal expression of MHC class II
molecules, the regulation of these genes is essential for a
normally functioning immune system. Genes encoding MHC class
II antigens were indeed initially described as "immune
response genes" [Benaceraff, Science 212 (1981), 1229-1238].
This regulation concerns not only the level of expression of
class II molecules but also the very restricted cell type
specificity, since most cells in the body are normally MHC
class II negative. The complexity of this regulation involves
two distinct modes of control, namely constitutive expression
in cells such as B lymphocytes and inducible expression in
certain cell types, such as monocytes
