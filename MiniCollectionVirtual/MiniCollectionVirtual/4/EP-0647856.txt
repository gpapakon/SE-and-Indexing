<ABSTRACT>
A method for monitoring the opening or openings of a closed space by means of an IR alarm system is described. In this case:   a) a measurement process is generated by means of a control module having a control unit, an optoelectronic unit and an optical unit, in the case of which measurement process modulated IR radiation is emitted in pulsed from from at least one IR transmitting element of the optoelectronic unit, and the radiation which is reflected on the boundary regions of the opening or openings is detected as the measurement signal by at least one IR receiving element of the optoelectronic unit, b) the directional characteristic of IR radiation is matched, by means of optical components in the optical unit, to the opening which is in each case to be monitored, c) the measurement signal which is detected by the receiving elements having eliminated the constant light component is evaluated by the control unit of the control module by comparison with a mean value which is readjusted, and the operating mode of the alarm system is defined as a function of this comparison, in that d) if the measurement signal and the readjustment mean value correspond approximately, the normal mode is preset as the operating mode, in the case of which the next measurement process is generated after a pause period, and the control unit, transmitting elements and receiving elements are turned off during the pause period, or e) if there is a significant discrepancy between the measurement signal and the readjustment mean value, the alarm mode is preset as the operating mode, in the case of which a number of measurement processes which follow one another immediately in time are generated and a comparison with criteria which are stored in the control module is carried out in order to assess these measurement processes in such a way that the entry of objects or people through the opening or openings to be monitored is identified, and an alarm signal (ALARM) is triggered if the measurement signals of the measurement processes correspond to the stored criteria.

Method of monitoring the openings (2, 3) in an enclosed
space (1) by means of an IR alarm system, wherein:


a) a test cycle is generated by means of a control module (4)
comprising a control unit, an opto-electronic unit (5) and an

optical unit (6) whereby modulated IR rays (14) are emitted in
the form of pulses from at least one IR emitting unit (7, 8, 9)

of the opto-electronic unit (5) and the rays (15) reflected at
the edge regions (17) of the openings (2, 3) are detected as a

test signal by at least one IR receiving element (10) of the
opto-electronic unit (5),

characterised in that,

b) the radiation pattern (16) of the IR rays (14, 15) is
matched to the opening (2, 3) currently being monitored by

means of optical components (11, 12, 13) in the optical unit
(6),
c) the test signal with the steady light component eliminated
therefrom that is detected by the receiving elements (10) is

evaluated (COMP) by the control unit of the control module (4)
by comparing it with a follow-up average value, and the

operating mode (NM, AM) of the alarm system is set in
dependence on this comparison in that
d) the normal mode (NM) is prescribed as the operating mode
when the test signal and the follow-up average value are

approximately equal, whereby the next test cycle is generated
after a rest period and the control unit, the emitting elements 

(7, 8, 9) and the receiving elements (10) are switched off
during the rest period, or
e) in the case where there is a significant deviation of the
test signal from the follow-up average value, the alarm mode

(AM) is prescribed as the operating mode whereby a number of
test cycles are generated in direct succession and are

evaluated (VERIF) by comparision with criteria stored in the
control module (4) in a manner such that any ingress of the

openings (2, 3) being monitored by objects or people is
recognised, and an alarm signal (ALARM) is set off if the test

signals produced in the test cycles correspond to the stored
criteria.
Method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the
optical components (11, 12, 13) in the optical unit (6) are

installed at a fixed position relative to the emitting elements
(7, 8, 9) and receiving elements (10) of the opto-electronic

unit (5).
Method in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the rest periods in the normal mode (NM) are defined by

the signal (TIM) from a timing element.
Method in accordance with any of the Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the test range for the test signal is

adjusted during an adaptation phase in such a way that the test
signal lies in the centre of the test range in the normal mode

(NM).
Method in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that an
adaptation phase is initiated whenever the alarm system is 

activated, following each instance of an alarm and following
any drift of the reference value outside a variably sized

threshold window.
Method in accordance with any of the Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the steady light signal is measured and

that the test signal is converted into a value excluding the
steady light component thereby eliminating the steady light

dependency factor of the IR receiving elements (10).
