<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit device such as a
Dynamic Random Access Memory (hereinafter called "DRAM"), a Static
Random Access Memory (hereinafter called "SRAM"), a Read Only Memory
(hereinafter called "ROM") or the like, and particularly to a word line driver
employed in the semiconductor integrated circuit device.A semiconductor memory device such as a DRAM has a word line driver for
selecting one of memory cells. This type of word line driver has been
disclosed in, for example, JP-A-63113888.It is an object of the present invention to provide a word line driver capable
of reducing the number of elements as compared with a word line driver
employed in a conventional semiconductor memory device and providing a
reliable operation.According to the present invention there is provided a word line driver circuit
arrangement as defined in appended Claim 1. The second switching means may be switched by a drive signal in dependence
on the common decode signal. The drive signal and the decode signal may
be of opposite phase.Accordingly, the driver may comprise a plurality of level shifters comprising:
a voltage supply at pump voltage, a latch for selecting and outputting the
drive signal and a switching circuit for controlling the latch in dependence of
the common decode signal.An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:

a DRAM, for example. A block diagram of the DRAM to which the word
line driver 6 a part of which is shown in Fig. 1 is applied, is shown in Fig. 2. The DRAM to which the present invention is applied, will
first be described with reference to Fig. 2.The DRAM comprises a timing control circuit 1 for receiving
a control signal CT and a clock CK therein and outputting
therefrom control signals S1 for controlling timings provided for
respective components, a row address decoder 2 for decoding a
row address ADRj so as to output a
