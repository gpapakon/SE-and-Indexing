<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the stabilisation of organic pigments against the influence 
of light and weather by the addition of an N-hydrocarbyloxy amine. It is known that not all organic pigments always have a very good fastness to light and 
weathering. Nevertheless, some of them have proved to be valuable pigments. Although 
they already have a very good resistance to light and weathering, it has now been found 
that, surprisingly, this can be improved further, in transparent as well as in opaque 
pigment forms, if the pigments are mixed with an N-hydrocarbyloxy amine. N-hydrocarbyloxy amines, in particular an N-hydrocarbyloxy derivatives of HALS 
(Hindered Amine Light Stabiliser), have been disclosed e.g. in US Patents 4 921 962, 
5 019 613, 5 021 483, 5 021 486, 5 021 577 and in EP-A 389 428 as light stabilisers for 
polymers against the degradative effects of actinic stimuli. They were found particularly 
effective in stabilising organic materials such as polyolefins, elastomers, polyvinyl 
chloride, polyesters, polyurethanes, ambient cured and acid catalysed thermoset coatings 
and enamels. EP-A 309 401 discloses the use of N-hydroxy-HALS for preventing deficiencies such as 
embrittlement, cracking, corrosion, erosion, loss of gloss, chalking and yellowing of 
coatings containing some specific organic pigments such as phthalocyanine and azo 
pigments. It has now been found, quite surprisingly, that even the already high resistance of certain 
pigments to light and weathering can be improved further by mixing or coating of the 
pigment particles with an N-hydrocarbyloxy amine. The present invention accordingly relates to light-stabilised pigment compositions 
comprising 
a) at least one organic pigment chosen from the group comprising azo pigments,  
 
quinacridones, phthalocyanines, indanthrones, flavanthrones, pyranthrones, 
anthraquinones, perylenes, dioxazines, perinones, thioindigo, isoindolines, isoindolinones 
and metal complexes and b) 1 to 100% by weight, based on the pigment, of an N-hydrocarbyloxy amine consisting 
of at least one unsubstituted or substituted 5-, 6- or 7-membered heterocyclic ring 
containing a divalent group of the formula 
 
in which
 
R is C₁-C₁₈alkyl, C₂-C₁₂alkenyl, C₂-C₁₂alkynyl, C₅-C₁₂cycloalkyl, C₆-C₁₀aryl or 
C₇-C₁₂aralkyl,
 
R₁ and R₂ independently of one another are methyl, ethyl or phenyl, or together form a 4- 
to 12-membered aliphatic ring, and
 
L is an aromatic radical. Particularly suitable pigments are those of the isoindoline, isoindolinone,
