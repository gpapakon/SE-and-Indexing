<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for operating a gas turbine set, in which the air prepared in a low-pressure compressor (1) is mixed downstream of the compression with a fuel (4) and fed to a pressure-wave machine (3), which operates with isochoric or isobaric combustion, and burned, and the working gas obtained in this way is subsequently applied to a high-pressure turbine (7) and a low-pressure turbine (8). In the method, partly expanded and cooled gas from the high-pressure turbine (7) is mixed with the component flow led from the pressure-wave machine (3) to the low-pressure turbine (8). Subsequently, fuel (4) is injected and the mixture is burned in a combustion chamber (9). A very high efficiency, very good part load behaviour (response) and minium NOx emission values are obtained by means of the reheating.

Method of operating a gas turbine installation in
which the air prepared in a low-pressure compressor (1)

is supplied via a low-pressure conduit (2) to a
pressure-wave machine (3) operating with constant-volume

or constant-pressure combustion, the air being
mixed with a fuel (4) downstream of the compression and

the mixture being burnt in the pressure-wave machine
(3), and the working gas obtained in this manner is

subsequently admitted via a high-pressure driving-gas
conduit (5) to a high-pressure turbine (7) and via a

low-pressure driving-gas conduit (6) to a low-pressure
turbine (8), there being an admixture of partially

expanded and cooled gas from the high-pressure turbine
(7) into the partial quantity flow led from the

pressure-wave machine (3) to the low-pressure turbine
(8) before entry into the low-pressure turbine (8), and

fuel (4) being introduced after the admixture process
and the mixture being burnt in a combustion chamber

(9), characterized in that a part of the mixture of
partially expanded and cooled exhaust gas from the

high-pressure turbine (7) and of the partial quantity
flow led from the pressure-wave machine to the low-pressure

turbine (8) is branched off before the
introduction of fuel (4) for reheating, is mixed with a

part of the air compressed in the compressor and is
returned via an exhaust gas conduit (12) and a throttle

butterfly (13) into the low-pressure conduit (2)
shortly before entry into the pressure-wave machine

(3).
