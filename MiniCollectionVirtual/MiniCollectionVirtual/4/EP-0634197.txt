<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ski binding, particularly a front binding.   The binding comprises a base (10) joined to the ski, a body (8) mounted on the base, a jaw (4), an energy spring (11) housed in the body to elastically oppose the opening movements of the jaw in response to the lateral and vertical stresses of the boot and a support plate (20) on which the boot sole rests. It is characterised in that the support plate (20) is movable in terms of a rolling (rocking) movement and in that a second rocking (tilting) circuit of the jaw giving rise to the release of the boot and independent of the energy spring of the jaw is controlled by the rolling rocking of the support plate of the boot.

<CLAIMS>
A binding element for alpine skis comprising: 

a base (10,51,81) connected to the ski; 
a body (8, 54, 82) mounted on the base; 
a boot retention jaw (4, 53, 83) carried by the 
body; 
the jaw comprising two lateral wings (5, 6, 83, 
84) for retaining the boot and a vertically retaining sole 

clamp; 
an energy spring (11, 55, 97) housed in the body 
to elastically oppose the opening movements of the jaw in 

response to biases of the boot; and 
a support plate (20, 73, 116) on which the sole of 
the boot rests, 
 
   characterized by the fact that the support plate 

(20, 73, 116) is mobile in a rocking motion, and that a second 
circuit for tilting the jaw, causing release of the boot, is 

controlled by the rocking motion of the boot support plate. 
A binding element according to claim 1, 
characterized by the fact that one of the elements including 

the base (10), the body (54), the wings (83, 84), is connected 
to the element (12, 52, 82) which bears it or on which it is 

mounted by a journal means (13, 14, 15, 61, 62, 90, 91) and by 
a disengaging means (33, 34, 62, 93, 94, 110) whose opening is 

controlled by the rocking motion of the boot support plate 

(20, 73, 116). 
A binding element according to claim 2, 
characterized by the fact that the base (13, 10) is connected 

to the ski by means of a member (14) affixed to the ski, that 
the member bears a substantially vertical pivot (15) about 

which the base is pivotally mounted, and that a latch (31, 32, 
33, 34) controlled by the rocking motion of the support plate 

retains the base (13, 10) in the axis of the member (14).  
 
A binding element according to claim 3, 
characterized by the fact that the support plate (20) is 

rotationally journalled about a median horizontal and 
longitudinal axis (21), and that it has two lugs (31, 32) on 

the side of the base between which the base is engaged, that 
the angle of the rocking motion of the plate and the height of 

the overlapping between the lugs and the lateral edges of the 
base are determined so that the lugs release the base (13, 10) 

after a defined tilting of the amplitude of the support plate. 
A binding element according to claim 4, 
characterized by the fact that two springs (23, 24) exert an 

upward vertical thrust on the support plate (20) on each side 
of its median horizontal and longitudinal journal axis (21). 
A binding element according to claim 2, 
characterized by the fact that the base bears a pivot (52), 

that the pivot comprises a ring (61) pivotally mounted about 
a bore (60) affixed to the base (51), that the spring (55) 

takes support against the ring (61), that a latch (62) secures 
the ring on the bore (60), and that a linkage connects the 

support plate (73) to the latch (62) to disengage the ring 
with respect to the bore of the pivot during excessive rocking 

motion of the boot support plate. 
A binding element according to claim 6, 
characterized by the fact that the latch is a bar (62) 

slidably guided into a longitudinal opening (62) of the base, 
a projecting end of which is engaged in a housing (65) of the 

ring. 
A binding element according to claim 7, 
characterized by the fact that the bar (62) is actuated by a 

two-armed tipping element (67), one arm (68) connected to the  
 

bar (62) and the other receiving one end of the support plate 
(73) in support. 
A binding element according to claim 2, 
characterized by the fact that the jaw comprises two wings 

(83, 84), movably journalled about the axes (90, 91), and that 
the wings are maintained in boot retaining position by a latch 

whose opening is controlled by the rocking motion of the 
support plate (116). 
A binding element according to claim 9, 
characterized by the fact that the latch comprises two 

connecting rods (93, 94) journalled in the manner of a toggle 
joint, and a journalled lever actuating the toggle joint in 

opening position following a rocking motion of the support 
plate (116).
