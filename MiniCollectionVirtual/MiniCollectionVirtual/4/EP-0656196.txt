<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a soft-tissue 
prosthesis (10) which is formed from a tubular textile 

substrate (2) and a liner (4). The liner (4) is affixed to the 
intraluminal surface of the tubular textile portion (2) of 

the soft-tissue prosthesis to form a fluid-tight barrier 
on the intraluminal surface of the prosthesis (10). The liner (4) 

is preferably formed from a polymer. Thus, the soft-tissue 

prosthesis (10) formed in accordance with the present 
invention provides the advantages of both a textile 

prosthesis and a polymer prosthesis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implantable
tubular prosthesis having a textile substrate with a
fluid-tight microporous lining.Tubular prostheses are commonly used as vascular
grafts to replace damaged or diseased veins and arteries.
To maximize the effectiveness of any prosthesis, it is
desirable that the prosthesis have characteristics which
closely resemble that of the natural body lumen which it
is replacing.Presently, conventional tubular prostheses and,
more specifically, vascular grafts are formed by either
weaving, knitting or braiding synthetic fibers into a
tubular structure or using a polymer such as polytetrafluoroethylene
to create a tubular structure for use as
a prosthesis. Tubular textile structures have the
advantage of being naturally porous, which allows desired
tissue ingrowth and assimilation into the body. Porosity
must be balanced to allow for ingrowth of surrounding
tissue, yet minimize leakage during the initial
implantation. Attempts to control porosity and provide a
sufficient fluid barrier have focused on tighter stitch
construction such as knitted or woven double-velours and
biodegradable natural coatings such as collagen or
gelatin. While these grafts sought to overcome the
difficulties in achieving the porosity/fluid-tight
balance, they failed to adequately address the natural
tendency of tubular structures to kink or collapse when
the graft is twisted or bent during or subsequent to
implantation. Thus, the prior art solutions to the 
porosity/fluid-tight balance left unanswered the problems
of kinking and overall handling.One conventional solution to the kinking and
collapsing problems has focused on the reinforcement of
the prosthesis walls using reinforcing fibers, rings, or
bands circumferentially placed on the tubular structure.
Additional reinforcement of this kind, however, has the
disadvantage of reducing the radial and/or longitudinal
compliance of the graft due to the increased stiffness of
the reinforcing member. A reduction in compliance
reduces the area through which blood can flow, thereby
compromising the ability of the prosthesis to adjust to
body conditions and perform naturally. Additionally,
reinforcing members are generally made from solid
structural materials which cannot be penetrated by
cellular ingrowth from surrounding tissue and may even
cause the erosion of the surrounding tissue during
contraction.Another method of increasing the kink and crush
resistance of textile grafts is to crimp the graft, i.e.,
longitudinally compress the tubular
