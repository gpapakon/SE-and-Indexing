particle size of from about 1 to about 25 microns, which process comprises: 


(i) preparing by emulsion polymerization an anionic charged polymeric 
latex of submicron particle size, and comprising resin particles and anionic surfactant; 
(ii) preparing a dispersion in water, which dispersion comprises optional 
pigment, an effective amount of cationic flocculant surfactant, and optionally a charge 

control agent; 
(iii) shearing the dispersion (ii) with the polymeric latex thereby causing a 
flocculation or heterocoagulation of the formed particles of optional pigment, resin and 

charge control agent to form a high viscosity gel in which solid particles are uniformly 
dispersed; 
(iv) stirring the above gel comprised of latex particles, and oppositely 
charged dispersion particles for an effective period of time to form electrostatically bound 

relatively stable toner size aggregates with narrow particle size distribution; and 
(v) heating the electrostatically bound aggregated particles at a 
temperature above the resin glass transition temperature (Tg) thereby providing the toner 

composition comprising resin, optional pigment and optional charge control agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to processes for the preparation of
toner compositions, and more specifically to aggregation and coalescence processes for
the preparation of toner compositions.In reprographic technologies, such as xerographic and ionographic devices,
toners with average volume diameter particle sizes of from about 9 µm (microns) to about 20 µm
(microns) are effectively utilized. Moreover, in some xerographic technologies, such as the
high volume Xerox Corporation 5090 copier-duplicator, high resolution characteristics and
low image noise are highly desired, and can be attained utilizing the small sized toners of
the present invention with an average volume particle of less than 11 µm (microns) and
preferably less than about 7 µm (microns) and with narrow geometric size distribution (GSD) of
from about 1 16 to about 1.3. Additionally, in some xerographic systems wherein process
color is utilized such as pictorial color applications, small particle size colored toners of
from about 3 to about 9 µm (microns) are highly desired to avoid paper curling. Paper curling is
especially observed in pictorial or process color applications wherein three to four layers of
toners are transferred and fused onto paper. During the fusing step, moisture is driven off
from the paper due to the high fusing temperatures of from about 130 to 160°C applied to
the paper from the fuser. Where only one layer of toner is present, such as in black or in
highlight xerographic applications, the amount of moisture driven off during fusing is
reabsorbed proportionally by paper and the resulting print remains relatively flat with
minimal curl. In pictorial color process applications wherein three to four colored toner
layers are present, a thicker toner plastic level present after the fusing step inhibits the
paper from sufficiently absorbing the moisture lost during the fusing step, and image
paper curling results. These and other disadvantages and problems are avoided or
minimized with the toners and processes of the present invention. It is preferable to use
small toner particle sizes, such as from about 1 to 7 µm (microns), and with higher pigment
loading, such as from about 5 to about 12 percent by weight of toner, such that the mass
of toner layers deposited onto paper is reduced to obtain the same quality of image and
resulting in a thinner plastic toner layer onto paper after fusing, thereby minimizing or
avoiding paper curling. Toners prepared in accordance with the present invention enable
the use
