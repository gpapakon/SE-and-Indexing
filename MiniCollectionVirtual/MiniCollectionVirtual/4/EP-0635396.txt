<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for lifting and/or lowering a load on to or from a load
carrier comprising an arm (7, 39) which is pivotably mounted to the load

carrier (27, 29, 30) and securing means provided on the arm for a load,
wherein the arm is pivotable about an axis (8) fixed to the load carrier

into a lifted position in which the arm can be fixed for stable positioning
of the lifted load on the load carrier, characterised in that in a lowered

position for fixing the load to the arm (7, 39) the arm bears against an
abutment (4) which is force-lockingly connected to the load carrier (27,

29, 30) and that the arm is connected by way of a transmission (2) to a
force storage means (1) for the transmission of a force of the force

storage means to the load.
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the load can
be rigidly secured to the arm (7).
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the load can
be pivotably secured to the arm (7, 39).
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the force
storage means (1) and the transmission (2) are mounted on a common carrier

(3) and that the direction of force with which the force storage means (1)
acts on the transmission (2) is variable.
Apparatus according to claim 4 characterised in that the directions
of the force of the force storage means (1) are at both sides of a dead

centre position of the transmission (2), wherein on one side of the dead
centre position the storage means force is carried by the abutment (4) on

the common carrier (3) and on the other side of the dead centre position
the storage means force drives the transmission (2) in a lifting direction.
Apparatus according to claim 5 characterised in that the abutment
(4) further defines a rest position in which the transmission (2) is held

without load on the load carrier (27, 29, 30). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the drive
force of the force storage means (1) can be transmitted by way of a force

engagement point (17) to a rocker member (6) mounted pivotably on the
common carrier (3) and that a pivot arm (7) accommodating the load can be

coupled to the rocker member (6).
Apparatus according to claim 7 characterised in that the force
engagement point (17) of the force storage means (1) can be moved into the

positions on both sides of the dead centre position by pivotal movement of
the rocker member (6).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that a
two-wheeler holder (18) can be secured to the arm (7, 39).
