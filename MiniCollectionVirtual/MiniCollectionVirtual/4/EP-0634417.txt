<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a process for converting 
a high-boiling component, resulting from the reaction of an 

organochloride with silicon, into more commercially 
desirable monosilanes. The process comprises contacting the 

high- boiling component with hydrogen chloride and hydrogen 
gas at a
 temperature within a range of 250°C. to 1000°C. in 
the presence of a catalyst selected from activated carbon, 

alumina, silica, zeolite, AlCl₃, AlCl₃ supported on a 
support selected from carbon, silica and alumina; platinum 

supported on a support selected from carbon, silica and 
alumina; and palladium supported on a support selected from 

carbon, silica and alumina.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a process for converting
a high-boiling component, resulting from the reaction of
organochloride with silicon, into more commercially
desirable monosilanes. The process comprises contacting the
high-boiling component with hydrogen chloride and hydrogen
gas at a temperature within a range of 250°C. to 1000°C. in
the presence of a catalyst selected from activated carbon,
alumina, silica, zeolite, AlCl3, AlCl3 supported on a
support selected from carbon, silica and alumina; platinum
supported on a support selected from carbon, silica and
alumina; and palladium supported on a support selected from
carbon, silica and alumina.The high-boiling component useful in the present
process results from the "Direct Process," where an
organohalide is reacted with silicon in the presence of a
suitable catalyst to form monosilanes. The Direct Process
is described by US-A 2,380,995 and US-A 2,488,487. It is
the main commercial process by which organohalosilanes (i.e.
monosilanes), for example dimethyldichlorosilane and
trimethylchlorosilane, are formed. These organohalosilanes
are reactive compounds which can undergo numerous reactions
to form a variety of useful silicon containing compounds and
polymers. A major commercial use of organohalosilanes is in
the production of polysiloxane polymers which are useful as
heat transfer fluids, lubricants and the like and which can
be further processed to form silicone elastomers, resins,
sealants and adhesives.Operation of the Direct Process results not only
in the production of the desirable monosilanes, but also in 
a high boiling component typically considered to be all
materials with a boiling point higher than the particular
diorganodihalosilane produced in the process. The high-boiling
component is a complex mixture that includes
compounds containing SiSi, SiOSi, SiCSi, SiCCSi and SiCCCSi
linkages in the molecules. Typical compounds found in a
high-boiling component are described in US-A 2,598,435 and
US-A 2,681,355. The high-boiling component may also
comprise silicon containing solids and soluble and insoluble
compounds of copper, aluminum and zinc.In current commercial operations for performing
the Direct Process, the high-boiling component can
constitute as much as ten percent of the resultant product.
Therefore, it is desirable to convert the high-boiling
component into more commercially desirable products to both
reduce low value by-products and to improve raw materials
utilization.The prior art for converting the high boiling
component of the
