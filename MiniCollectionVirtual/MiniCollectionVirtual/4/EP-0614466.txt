<ABSTRACT>
In the invention a particular procatalyst composition intended for the polymerization of olefins is prepared by reacting the carrier particles consisting of a MgCl2-C2H5OH-complex with TiCl4. When the method is applied into pilot-scale it was noticed that the procatalyst composition obtained produced olefin polymer, the finely-divided material portion of which was deterioratingly high. This was caused by the fact that the procatalyst composition particles had decomposed to finely-divided material during the synthesis, which was then in the polymerization repeated in the polymer structure due to the so-called replica phenomenon. In the invention it has unexpectedly been noticed that the breaking of the carrier particles is not a result of e.g. mechanical strain but of the fact that when the carrier particles react with the TiCl4 a heavy discharge of hydrogen chloride is first occurring as a result of the reaction which breaks the carrier particles. The carrier particles can, according to the invention, be maintained undamaged during the reaction by distributing the release in the reaction or from the reaction of the hydrogen chloride created in the reaction to a molar velocity not exceeding the fivefold value of the molar mean velocity of the release. This is achieved among other things by adding reagents unusually slowly, by using lower temperatures and heating velocities, by intensifying the agitation, by using an overpressure and/or by conducting diluting inert gas into the reaction mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method for the preparation of an olefin polymerization catalyst consisting of particles of equal sizeThe invention relates to a method for the preparation of a particulate procatalyst composition intended for the poly¬ merization of olefins by reacting the carrier particles consisting of a MgCl2-C2H5OH-complex with TiCl4.For the polymerization of olefins, generally, the Ziegler- Natta-catalyst system, which consists of a so-called pro¬ catalyst and a co-catalyst, is used. The procatalyst is based on a compound of a transition metal belonging to any of the groups IVA-VIII (Hubbard) of the periodical table of the elements and the co-catalyst is based on an or- ganometallic compound of a metal belonging to any of the groups IA-III(A) (Hubbard) of the periodical table of the elements. The catalyst system can also comprise a carrier, on which the transition metal compound is layered, and electron donor compounds improving and modifying the cata¬ lytic properties.When Ziegler-Natta-procatalysts intended for the polymeri¬ zation of olefins and particularly of propene are prepa- red, carrier particles consisting of solid magnesium chlo¬ ride and ethanol are reacted with titanium tetrachloride. As a result a magnesium chloride is created, the crystal structure of which is strongly modified, i.e. becoming in practice amorphous and which can coordinate with titanium tetrachloride. Thus, the titanium tetrachloride, which has been combined with the amorphous magnesium chloride, then forms the active centers of the catalyst. As byproducts of this process hydrogen chloride and ethoxy titanium tri¬ chloride (1, 2) are formed:MgCl2.EtOH + TiCl4 = MgCl2.+ TiCl3.0Et + HC1 (1) 10MgCl2. + TiCl4 = 10MgCl.TiCl4 (2)In laboratory conditions polyolefins have been obtained using the procatalysts prepared in this manner. The acti- 

 vity of the catalyst has been good. The particle size, particle size distribution and other properties of the polyolef ns have been satisfactory.When going over from laboratory scale to production in larger scale it has, however, been noticed that the par¬ ticle size distribution of the polymer product is every¬ thing but satisfactory. The product contains, namely, com¬ pared with a product prepared with a laboratory procata- lyst very great amounts of finely-divided substance or material, the diameter of which is less than 1mm. This can be seen among other things in fig. 1, where the portion of the finely-divided material becomes multiplied when going over from a laboratory-prepared procatalyst to a
