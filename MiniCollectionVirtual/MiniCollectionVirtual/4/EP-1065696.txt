An ion source for use in an ion implantation apparatus, the ion source
comprising


a cathode, a filament, a filament support assembly, and a support member. The filament
support assembly positions the filament within the cathode. The support member is

configured to maintain the filament within the cathode at a desired position during
operation of the ion source and when there is a loosening of a grip that the filament

support assembly has on the filament.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ion implantation apparatus, and more
particularly, to an ion source and ion source subassembly for use in an ion implantation
apparatus.When fabricating semiconductor integrated circuit devices, it is often desirable
to dope a semiconductor substrate or wafer with impurities to produce doped regions,
such as well regions, channel regions, or source or drain regions. Such doping can be
accomplished using ion implantation technologies. For this purpose, semiconductor
processing facilities typically include an ion implantation apparatus.One example of an ion implantation apparatus is described in U.S. Patent No.
5,497,006 to Sferlazzo et al., which is incorporated herein by reference. The ion
implantation apparatus of Sferlazzo et al. and its various components are reproduced in
Figs. 1-5. As shown in Fig. 1, the ion implantation apparatus 10 comprises, among
other things, an ion source 12 and a beam analyzing magnet 14 supported by a high
voltage housing 16. Ions produced by the ion source 12 are accelerated away from the
ion source 12 by electric fields produced by extraction electrodes 80. An ion beam 20
exiting the ion source 12 travels through an evacuated tube 18 and enters an ion
implantation chamber 22 where it impinges upon one or more targets, e.g., silicon
wafers, supported by a support 40. While traveling from the ion source 12 to the ion
implantation chamber 22, the ion beam 20 is shaped, evaluated, and accelerated to a
desired implantation energy. The ion beam analyzing magnet 14, which is controlled
by an implanter controller 82, causes only those ions having an appropriate mass to
reach the ion implantation chamber 22 by producing a magnetic field that bends the
trajectory of those ions to an implant trajectory. Silicon wafers are inserted into the ion implantation chamber 22 by a robotic
arm 70 from a cassette 73. The ion implantation chamber 22 is supported on a movable
pedestal 28 that allows the ion implantation chamber 22 to be aligned relative to the ion
beam 20. A motor 50 rotates the support 40 about an axis 42 and a linear drive 52
indexes the support 40 back and forth within the chamber 22. The support 10 is
positioned such that untreated wafers can be moved into the chamber 22 and treated
wafers can be withdrawn from the chamber 22 by the robotic arm 70.As shown in Figs. 2-5, the ion source 12 comprises, among other things, a
plasma arc chamber 76 having an exit aperture 78, a support block 120 that supports the
plasma arc chamber 76, and a
