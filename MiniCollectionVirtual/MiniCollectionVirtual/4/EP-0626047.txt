<CLAIMS>
Adhesive connection between at least three machine 
elements (1, 2, 3), in particular a non-rotatable 

connection of two gear wheels (1, 2) to a shaft (3), 
characterized in that two gear wheels (1, 2) and a shaft 

(3) are involved in the adhesive connection, the sum of 
the involved adhesive surfaces (K1, K2) being greater 

than the direct contact surface between the shaft (3) and 
at least one gear wheel (1 or 2). 
Adhesive connection according to claim 1, characterized 
in that one of the adhesive surfaces (K2) is formed by 

tubular portions of the gear wheels (1, 2) which engage 
one into the other. 
Adhesive connection according to claim 1, characterized 
in that a gear wheel (1) bonded to the shaft (3) has a 

tubular portion (6), to which the other gear wheel (2) is 
bonded. 
Adhesive connection according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that both gear wheels (1, 2) are bonded 

directly to the shaft (3) and the adhesive surface (K1, 
K2) is enlarged by tubular portions (6, 7) of the gear 

wheels (1, 2) which engage one into the other. 
Adhesive connection according to claim 4, characterized 
in that part of the adhesive surface (K1) lies on 

differently sized diameters (D1, D2) of the shaft (3). 
Adhesive connection according to at least one of the 
preceding claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 

machine elements (1, 2, 3) are connected with transition 
fits.
