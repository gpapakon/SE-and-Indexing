<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition containing
thallium 201 wherein the adhering of thallium 201 to a container
is prevented by the addition of a particular reducing agent which
prevents thallium 201 from adhering to a container.Although thallium is a metal belonging to III-A group
in the periodic table, it is known that, when it is in a certain
ionic form, it takes the similar behaviors in the living body to
those of potassium belonging to I-A group. In the normal
myocardia, potassium ions are actively incorporated in the
myocardial cells by an enzyme in the myocardial cell membranes
and thereby are accumulated in the myocardia. This incorporation
in the normal myocardia depends mainly upon the local blood flow
in the myocardia. When a pharmaceutical agent containing
thallium ions which is taking the similar behaviors to those of
potassium ions in the body is injected intravenously, the agent
becomes distributed to the muscles in the whole body. However,
many thallium ions are distributed to the active myocardia but
not in the affected parts such as ischemiaOn the other hand, thallium ions are distributed
depending upon the blood flow as in the case of cesium ions and
as the result thallium ions have the marked tendency to be pooled
in the tumor lesions in comparison with other tissues. This
accumulation of thallium ions in the tumor lesions is presumed 
to be caused by substitution of potassium ions with thallium ions
present in an enzyme. In addition, the extent of accumulation
of thallium ions is largely influenced by the blood flow
distribution toward the tumor.From the above descriptions, a solution of thallium 201
salt, in particular, thallium[201Tl]chloride is useful as a
radioactive diagnostic agent which is intravenously injected for
examining the cardiac disorders and thyroid gland and lung
tumors. And a complex of thallium 201 with a certain compound
is useful as a radioactive diagnostic agent which is
intravenously injected for diagnosing the brain disorders.
Moreover EP-A-0 123 314 discloses that such a complexed radioactive
diagnostic agent may further comprise a reductive material
chosen from ascorbic acid and erythrobic acid.Such the radioactive diagnostic agent containing
thallium[201Tl]chloride for intravenous administration is prepared
generally by diluting thallium[201Tl]chloride with a physiological
saline to the desired concentration of the radioactivity and
filling the resulting solution in a container such as glass vial
and syringe vial according to the preparation
