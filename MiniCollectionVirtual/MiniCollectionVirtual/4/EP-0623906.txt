<ABSTRACT>
A theft proofing apparatus for hindering theft when an intruder is detected in an alarm mode with no attendant. 
In a smoke generation system formed by coupling this theft proofing apparatus with an alarm system including an 

abnormality detector (20) for detecting an intruder into an alarm area and a mode setter (10) for setting or releasing 
an alarm state of the alarm area, and including a smoke generator (60) for generating smoke inside the alarm area, 

the smoke generator (60) is activated in response to the detection signal of the abnormality detector (20) when the 
alarm area is set to a unmanned state and alarm state by the mode setter (10), fills the alarm area with the smoke 

and restricts sight around the intruder. In this way, theft and destruction by the intruder can be prevented. When the 
alarm area is set to attendance mode inclusive of the release state by the mode setter (10), smoke generation activation 

control means of the system prevents the smoke generator (60) from being activated by the detection signals of the 
abnormality detector (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for preventing
destruction or theft in a secure area such as a bank-vault.
More particularly, the present invention relates
to a system for subduing an intruder by cutting off his
field of vision by utilising smoke.Apparatuses which generate tear gas or a gas having
an offensive odour in a monitored area have been proposed
in the past as apparatuses for preventing theft.
However, these apparatuses have not been able to control
the generation and operation of the gas in a particular
gas emission object zone.These appatatuses have not been put into practical
application due to the possibility of gas being generated
by erroneous operation, and troublesome exhaust operation
after the emission of the gas.On the other hand, an alarm system for raising an
alarm by detecting theft by an intruder in a building has
been developed and executed. As objects to be protected
have become more widespread in recent years, a more
effective management of such an alarm system has become
necessary. As to a warning mode, for example, the mode
can be divided into a mode for when no people are in the
area (MODE 1) and a mode for when people are in the area
(MODE 2). It is also possible to set the system to cover
only a specific zone.Such an effective system is also required for the
smoke generation alarm system.As a counter-measure for theft or destruction of
money, precious articles, etc., inside buildings, there
has been proposed a method which detects an intrusion of
moving objects such as people or other animals into a
specific area by suitable detection means installed at
predetermined positions inside the monitored area, emits
a tear gas or a gas having an offensive odour into the 
area so as to generate a situation in which the intruder
cannot stay inside the area and to force him to give up
his intention and action, and prevents in advance the
theft or destruction by forcing the intruder to leave the
area.However, such a tear gas or a gas having offensive
odour exerts adverse influences on the human body and
leaves particular offensive odours inside the monitored
area. Furthermore, the gas offends people entering the
area later. Still another problem is that if any exhibits
such as precious articles exist inside the monitored
area, the components of the tear gas or the gas having an
offensive odour adhere to the exhibits and contaminate
them. For these reasons, the method has not yet been put
into practical application.GB-A-2247094 discloses a vehicle anti-theft device
with a smoke
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An antitheft system comprising an intruder
detector (20) for detecting an intrusion into and

destruction or removal of equipment by an intruder in a
monitored area, a mode setter (10) for setting or

releasing a warning mode of the monitored area, a monitor
device (80) of a remote alarm centre, alarm communication

means (41) for sending a signal to said monitor device,
and smoke generation starting means (56) for starting the

generation of smoke from a smoke generator (60); wherein, when
the monitored area is in the warning mode, if the

intruder detector (20) detects an intrusion, said alarm
communication means (41) sends a signal to said monitor

device (80) and said smoke generation starting means (56)
starts the smoke generator (60),

characterised by a confirmation means for confirming the
generation of smoke in the monitored area, wherein, when said

confirmation means confirms the generation of smoke, a
signal of smoke generation confirmation is sent to said

monitor device (80).
An antitheft system according to claim 1,
wherein said monitor device (80) of the remote alarm centre

is connected through a telephone line to said alarm
communication means (41).
An antitheft system according to claim 1 or 2,
further comprising time counting means (57) for counting

time after the operation of said intruder detector, and a
release means (21) in the monitored area for releasing

the operation of the time counting means, wherein, when said time
counting means is released by said release means, the

smoke generator is prevented from starting. 
An antitheft system according to claim 1,
wherein said mode setter (10) selects one of a person

absent and warning state, a person present and warning
