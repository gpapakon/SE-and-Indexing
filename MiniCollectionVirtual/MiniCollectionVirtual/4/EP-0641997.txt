<CLAIMS>
Centrifugal pump of a radial or half-axial type
having a guidance device (4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) which

is arranged downstream of the impeller and guides the
pumped medium, connections for pressure detection being

fitted in the pump housing (1), which pressure detection
takes place downstream of the impeller (2) at two pressure

measurement points (A, B, B', B"), and an evaluation
unit converting the pressure difference between the

two pressure measurement points into a flow-rate
parameter, characterized in that a first pressure

measurement point (A) is arranged at a point, facing the
impeller (2), in the guidance device within an angle ν 
<

30° originating from the impellar centre, commencing at
the start (4, 6, 9, 12) of the guidance device and

opening in the rotation direction of the impeller, and in
that the second pressure measurement point (B, B' or B")

is arranged at a point remote from the impeller (12).
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 1, characterized
in that at least one of the pressure measurement

points (A, B, B', B") is fitted on a projection on a
spiral housing (1), the first pressure measurement point

(A) being arranged within an angle ν 
<
 30° originating
from the impeller centre and commencing at the start of

the projection.
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the first pressure measurement point (A) is

fitted on the side of the projection (4) facing the
impeller (2), and the second pressure measurement point

(B) is fitted on the side of the projection facing the
interior of the pressure connecting stub (3). 
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the first pressure measurement

point (A) is fitted on the side of the projection (A)
facing the impeller (2), and the second pressure measurement

point (B") is fitted in the region of the tip of
the projection (4).
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the first pressure measurement point (A) is

fitted on the side of the projection (4) facing the
impeller (2), and the second pressure measurement point

(B') is fitted in the region of the inlet cross-section
of the pressure connecting stub (3).
Centrifugal pump according to one of Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the pressure measurement points

(A, B, B") are fitted on a pressure connecting stub
start (9) which corresponds to a projection, and the

pressure measurement point (B') is fitted in the region
of the inlet cross-section of the pressure connecting

stub (3) of an annular space housing (7).
Centrifugal pump according to one of Claims 3 to
6, characterized in that one pressure measurement point

or both pressure measurement points (A, B, B") is or are
arranged on a component (6) which is mounted upstream of

a projection start or pressure connecting stub start, or
forms a projection start or pressure connecting stub

start.
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the directions in which the two pressure

measurement points (AB, AB") which are arranged on a
component (6) act include an angle of 50° ≤  ≤ 180°

between them.
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 1, characterized
in that at least one of the pressure measurement

points (A, B, B', B") is arranged on a guide vane start
(12) of a stator disc, the first pressure measurement

point (A) being arranged within an angle ν 
<
 30° originating
from the rotor centre and commencing at the guide

vane start.
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the first pressure measurement point (A) is

arranged on a side of a guide vane start (12) facing the
impeller (2), and the second pressure measurement point

(B) is arranged on a side of the guide vane start (12)
facing a guide vane channel (13).
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 9, characterized
in that the first pressure measurement point (A) is

arranged on a side of a guide vane start (12) facing the
impeller (2), and the second pressure measurement point

(B") is arranged on a side of the guide vane start (12)
facing the inlet flow direction.
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 9, characterized
in that the first pressure measurement point (A) is

fitted on a side of a guide vane start (12) facing the
impeller (2), and the second pressure measurement point

(B') is fitted in the region of the inlet cross-section
of a guide vane channel (13).
Centrifugal pump according to one of Claims 10 to
12, characterized in that one pressure measurement point

or both pressure measurement points (A-B") is or are
arranged on a component (14) which is mounted upstream of

a guide vane start (12) or forms a guide vane start (12).
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 13, characterized
in that the directions in which the two pressure

measurement points (AB, AB'') which are arranged on a
component (14) act include an angle of 50° ≤ ϑ ≤ 180°

between them.
