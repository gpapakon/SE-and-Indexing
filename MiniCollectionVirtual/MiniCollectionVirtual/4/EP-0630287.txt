Use of polysaccharides having primary alcohol functions for the 
production of microcapsules or microspheres by interfacial crosslinking 

of the primary alcohol functions of said polysaccharide using an interfacial 
crosslinking agent constituted by an acid dichloride or an acid anhydride. 
Microcapsules or microspheres, characterized in that they comprise 
a wall in polysaccharide having primary alcohol functions and being crosslinked 

by interfacial crosslinking using an interfacial crosslinking agent constituted by an 
acid dichloride or an acid anhydride. 
Microcapsules or microspheres according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said polysaccharide has a molecular weight higher than 5,000 Daltons. 
Microcapsules or microspheres according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that said polysaccharide comprises between 1 and 4 primary 

alcohol functions per diosidic moiety. 
Microcapsules or microspheres according to one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that said polysaccharide is selected from a natural polysaccharide, 

such as galactomannans, carrageenans, glucomannans, natural gums, amylose or 
amylopectine and mixtures thereof, the polysaccharides issued from fermentation; 

or a chemically modified polysaccharide comprising primary alcohol groups 
spaced from the polymer chain and more readily accessible notably to a possible 

reaction with a crosslinking agent, in particular C
1
-C
30
 hydroaxylalkyl 
derivatives of polysaccharides. 
Microcapsules or microspheres according to one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that they contain a food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical active 

ingredient. 
Method for producing microcapsules or microspheres, characterized 
in that it comprises the following steps: 


dispersing or dissolving in aqueous phase a polysaccharide having 
primary alcohol functions then obtaining an aqueous phase containing said 

polysaccharide in dispersion or in dissolved state, placing said aqueous phase in 
contact with an organic phase non-miscible in water and containing an interfacial 

crosslinking agent constituted by an acid dichloride or an acid anhydride, in order 
to produce an interfacial crosslinking of said primary alcohol functions of the 

polysaccharide for a long enough period to obtain microspheres or microcapsules 
with a wall comprising said polysaccharide having primary alcohol functions and  

 
being crosslinked by the acid dichloride or the acid anhydride thus forming ester 

bonds and said microspheres or microcapsules are then separated from the reaction 
medium by any separation means. 
Method according to claim 7, characterized in that an alkaline 
aqueous phase is used, which has a pH higher than 7, in particular comprised 

between about 7.1 and about 10. 
Method according to one of claims 7 to 8, characterized in that said 
polysaccharide is present in the aqueous phase at a concentration comprised 

between 0.2 % and 30 % by weight of said aqueous phase. 
Method according to one of claims 7 to 9, characterized in that said 
polysaccharide is heated for a long enough period to obtain the total dissolution of 

the polysaccharide, then the aqueous phase is cooled down to room temperature. 
Method according to one of claims 7 to 10, characterized in that the 
organic phase used is a vegetable oil, a fatty acid ester, a mineral oil, a silicone or 

an apolar organic solvent, in particular hexane, cyclohexane or chloroform. 
Method according to one of claims 7 to 11, characterized in that an 
emulsion is prepared by using an emulsifying agent in an oily phase. 
Method according to one of claims 7 to 12, characterized in that an 
active ingredient which is water-soluble, water-dispersible, non-soluble or 

liposoluble is intimately mixed with the aqueous phase containing the 
polysaccharide. 
Method according to claim 13, characterized in that, in the case of 

a liposoluble active ingredient, an emulsion-stabilizing agent is used, for example 
a colloid, a macromolecule or a synthetic or natural emulsifier. 
Method according to one of claims 7 to 14, characterized in that the 
proportion by weight of the crosslinking agent with respect to the weight of the 

polysaccharide-based solution varies between 20 and 60 %. 
Method according to one of claims 7 to 15, characterized in that 
said polysaccharide is selected among a natural polysaccharide, for example 

galactomannans, carrageenans, glucomannans, natural gums, amylose or 
amylopectin and mixtures thereof, the polysaccharides issued from fermentation; 

or a chemically modified polysaccharide comprising primary alcohol groups 
spaced from the polymer chain and more readily accessible notably to a possible 

reaction with a crosslinking agent, in particular C
1
-C

 hydroxyalkyl derivatives 
of polysaccharides.  

 
Food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition, characterized in 
that it comprises microcapsules or microspheres with a wall in polysaccharide with 

primary alcohol functions crosslinked by a crosslinking agent constituted by an 
acid dichloride or an acid anhydride thus forming ester bonds, said microcapsules 

or microspheres preferably contain at least partly a substance presenting a food, 
cosmetic or pharmaceutical advantage. 
Method for the preparation of a food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical 
composition, characterized in that it comprises using at least partly microcapsules 

or microspheres with a wall in polysaccharide having primary alcohol functions 
crosslinked by a crosslinking agent constituted by an acid dichloride or an acid 

anhydride thus forming ester bonds, said microcapsules or microspheres preferably 
containing at least partly a food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical active ingredient.
