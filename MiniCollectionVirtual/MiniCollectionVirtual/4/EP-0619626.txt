Electrical connector (CE) including a module 
carrier (PM) and a wiring chamber (CC) which are separate 

but adjacent, said module carrier having a plurality of 
connection modules (MC) which form, on the side opposite 

said wiring chamber, a plug-in face (FE) enabling said 
connector to be connected to a complementary electrical 

connector, which is similar or different, but which is 
provided with a complementary plug-in face and, on the 

side facing said wiring chamber, a connection face (FB) 
for the ends of electrical conductors (5) penetrating 

into said wiring chamber via ducts (CH) solidly fastened 
to the wall thereof, said modules being provided with 

connection members (8) passing through them in order to 
provide the electrical connections between said plug-in 

face and said connection face, characterized: 

in that said wiring chamber (CC) consists of two 
shells (C1, C2) which can be joined together, as 

well as to said module carrier (PM); 
in that said ducts (CH) consist of two half-ducts 
(30, 40) which can be joined longitudinally; and 
in that said ducts (CH) are held solidly fastened to 
said wiring chamber by being trapped between said 

two joined shells (C1, C2). 
Electrical connector according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that each half-duct (30, 40) is provided 

with a transverse base platelet (32, 37), in that said 
platelets form, after joining said half-ducts, transverse 

base plates (36) for said ducts and in that slots are 
provided in the thickness of side walls (52) of said 

shells in order to serve as a housing for said transverse 
base plates (36). 
Electrical connector according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that each half-duct (40) has a semicircular 

section. 
Electrical connector according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that each half-duct (30) has a U-shaped 

section. 
Electrical connector according to one of Claims  
 

1 to 4, characterized in that said half-ducts are joined 
along a longitudinal junction plane (33, 41) formed by 

interacting longitudinal shoulders (34, 35). 
Electrical connector according to one of Claims 
2 to 5, characterized in that the free edge (55) of said 

side walls (52) of said shells includes, plumb with said 
slots (54), cut-outs (56) of shape corresponding to the 

external shape of said ducts (CH). 
Electrical connector according to one of Claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that said module carrier (PM) 

includes, on the side of said wiring chamber (CC), a 
frame (50) surrounding said connection face (FB) and 

serving for the solid fastening of said shells to said 
module carrier. 
Electrical connector according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that said frame (50) includes a projecting 

peripheral rim (62), capable of interacting with 
assembly slots (63) provided in said shells (C1, C2). 
Electrical connector according to one of Claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that said shells (C1, C2) are 

joined along a junction plane (PJ) formed by interacting 
longitudinal shoulders (64 to 67). 
Electrical connector according to one of Claims 
1 to 9, characterized in that at least its joined shells 

are fixed to each other by screws.
