<ABSTRACT>
Intensity modulated light 
irradiates the scattering and absorption medium which 

is to be measured. After 
propagation in the scattering and absorption medium, the modulated 

light emerges therefrom and is incident to the photodetecting 
unit. The photodetecting unit converts the incident 

light into an electric signal. 
The feedback unit extracts the ac component 

from this signal, compares the intensity with a preset adjusting 
value, and controls the intensity tuneable light irradiating unit. 

The gain of the photodetecting means is fixed. 
Then the phase difference between the modulated incident light and the 

transmitted light is detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photodetecting
apparatus to be utilized in measurement of internal
information relative to light in a scattering and
absorption medium.Techniques of non-invasive measurement of an
absorption coefficient or a transport scattering
coefficient in a scattering and absorption medium by
irradiating the scattering and absorption medium such
as a living body with light such as pulsed light or
continuous light and detecting light diffused during
propagation in the scattering and absorption medium and
thereafter emerging therefrom have been drawing
attention. Especially, a method for obtaining internal
information in the scattering and absorption medium by
using pulsed light or intensity-modulated light as
irradiation light, measuring a timing difference or a
phase difference between the irradiation light and
light emerging from the scattering and absorption
medium after the irradiation light is diffused during
propagation therein, and obtaining the internal
information in the scattering and absorption medium 
from the information of phase difference is most
effective among such techniques.An apparatus utilizing this method is, for
example, disclosed in "B. Chance: PHASE MODULATION
SPECTROPHOTOMETRY, United States Patent No. 4972331".
This apparatus is irradiating a scattering and
absorption medium such as a living body with modulated
light resulting from modulating the intensity of light
having a plurality of predetermined wavelengths by a
predetermined modulation frequency, detecting light
emerging therefrom with a photomultiplier tube (PMT)
thereby to measure a phase difference between a phase
of an ac component having a modulation frequency of
modulated light upon irradiation and a phase of an ac
component having a modulation frequency of detected
light upon detection.In the above-described photodetection, it is
considered that an S/N ratio of the optically detected
signal is proportional to the one half power of the
number of detected photons. Accordingly, in the above-described
apparatus, light having a wavelength at which
the number of photons to be detected becomes the
smallest, that is, light having a wavelength at which
the intensity of output light becomes the smallest upon
irradiation with the same light intensity, or modulated
light with intensity at which the sufficient S/N ratio 
can be obtained for any kinds of scattering media needs
to irradiate an object to be measured. With this
radiation, a method for adjusting a gain of the
photodetecting apparatus so that
