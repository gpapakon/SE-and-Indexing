<DESCRIPTION>
 3-PYRIDIN0L DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS MEDICAMENTS.The present invention relates to pyridinol derivatives, processes for their preparation, intermediates in their preparation, their use as medicaments and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.The compounds of this invention are agonists of a cyclic A P- dependent protein kinase (cA-PrK) (see J. Biol. Chem., 1989, 264, 8443 - 8446) and are of use in combatting such conditions where such agonism is thought to be beneficial. They are likely to have anti-proliferative, anti-aggregatory, cholesterol-lowering, smooth muscle relaxant, positive lusitropic, anti-allergic or anti-inflammatory activities. They are likely to be useful in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases where there is a component of diastolic failure, cancer, psoriasis, atheroschlerosis, thrombosis, re-stenosis, chronic reversible lung disease such as asthma and bronchitis, allergic disease such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis and urticaria or gut motility disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.Accordingly the present invention provides compounds of the formula (1) :or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein :R- is OH or a bioprecursor thereof,R1 is A°Cθ2H, P(Z) (OH) (OR2), SO2H, SO3H or 5-tetrazolyl or a bioprecursor thereof,A° is CH2, CHF, CF2, CR3(OR4), CO or C(OR5) (OR6), 

 R2 is phenyl, C3_5cycloal yl, C3_5cycloalkylCι_4al yl, or Ci-βalkyl optionally substituted by Cι_4al oxy,R3 is H, methyl or ethyl,R4 is H or Cι_3alkyl,R and R^ are each C^-^al yl or together form a 1,2- ethanediyl group or 1,3-propanediyl group,Z is 0 or S, andAr is phenyl optionally substituted by one to three groups independently selected from C]__galkyl, C2-63-lkenyl, Ci-ςalkoxy, C3_galkenyloxy, C3_gcycloalkyl, C3__gcycloalkoxy, C _galkylthio, phenyl, phenylthio, benzyloxy, Ci-gpolyfluoroalkyl, Ci-gpolyfluoroalkoxy, halo, N(R7)2 or NHCOR7 wherein R7 is H or Ci-galkyl, or -X(CH2)nY- attached to adjacent carbon atoms of the phenyl ring wherein X and Y are independently CH2 or 0 and n is 1 to 3, wherein said C^-galkyl, C2-galkenyl or Cι_galkoxy groups can be independently substituted by OH, C _galkoxy, C3_6cycloal yl, N(R7)2, CO2R7 or CON(R7)2, orAr is 1-naphthyl optionally substituted in the 4-position by hydroxy or C _galkoxy, 2-naphthyl optionally substituted in the 1-position by hydroxy or C^-galkoxy, 3-phenanthryl, 9-phenanthryl, 2-quinolinyl, 4-quinolinyl, 3-thianaphthenyl or 2-benzofuranyl.Bioprecursors of the groups R- and R^ are derivatives thereof which are convertible in
