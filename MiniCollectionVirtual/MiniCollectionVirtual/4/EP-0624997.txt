<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiant heater for glass-ceramic cooking surfaces, in which electrical heating resistors, constructed as heating filaments, are fastened together with strip-shaped holding elements on the lower part of the insulating body. It is the object of the invention to propose designs of the strip-shaped holding elements which result in an additional positive fastening of the holding elements in the lower part of the insulating body. According to the invention, this is achieved in that the strip-shaped holding elements (4) are provided with perforations (9) in that area which is to be incorporated in the lower part (2) of the insulating body, through which perforations the insulating material can penetrate during pressing during the manufacture of the lower part (2) of the insulating body. After the lower part (2) of the insulating body has cured, this results in a permanent positive connection between the holding element (4) and lower part (2) of the insulating body.
