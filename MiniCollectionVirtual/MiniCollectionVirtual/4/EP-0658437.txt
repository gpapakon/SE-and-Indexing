<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes a method of creating a shaped image in a 
workpiece using a flashlamp, the method comprising positioning a template 

proximate the workpiece and directing radiation emitted by the flashlamp during 
a short pulse of less than approximately 100 µsec through the template toward 

the workpiece.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a method of creating a shaped
image in a workpiece. More specifically, the present invention relates to a
method of creating a shaped image in a workpiece using a pulsed radiation in
combination with a template.Techniques for forming a shaped image in a workpiece are many. Such
techniques are widely used in the manufacture of many types of electronic
devices, such as magnetic disks, memory card circuits and flexible circuits.
Related techniques are also employed to mark various devices with information
such as bar-codes, to create printing elements such as lithographic plates, and to
generate ornamental designs.Stamping is one technique for creating a shaped image in a workpiece.
For example, presses with stamping dies create optically readable servo stitches
in magnetic disks. One problem with the stamping technique is that stamping
dies have relatively short life spans. Also, the elastic nature of the disks causes
changes in the geometry of stamped stitches over time.Chemical etching is another technique for creating a shaped image in a
workpiece. In this technique, photoresist is applied to a substrate and patterned
in a known manner. Developed portions of the resist are then removed by
chemical etching to leave the shaped image. The chemicals that perform the
etch are not entirely beneficial. For instance, the chemicals tend to undercut
undeveloped portions of the workpiece. This undercutting limits the size and
location of the shaped image which can be formed in the workpiece.Other well-known processes for creating a shaped image in a workpiece
include electron-beam, ion beam, corona, and plasma treatment. These
methods are either continuous or long pulse length etching processes which, due
to their low energy flux, yield a low heat transfer rate. The low heat transfer
rates are detrimental when etching surface coatings such as polymer-based 
coatings. Specifically, the low heat transfer rates create an undesirable thermal
treatment effect in areas of the coating other than the etched areas.Laser-based techniques are also useful for creating a shaped image in a
workpiece. One technique utilizes an Argon/Ion laser to directly burn
optically-readable servo stitches one by one into magnetic disks. The laser
beam is optically switched on and off while the disk is spinning and a final lens
objective is translated. Another technique concerns a method of producing a
machine readable coded marking in a surface of a workpiece, such as a glass
faceplate panel of a

Method of creating a shaped image in a workpiece
using a flashlamp, the method comprising:


positioning a template proximate the workpiece
and
directing radiation emitted by the flashlamp
during a short pulse of approximately 100 µsec

or less through the template toward the workpiece,
the radiation capable of moving debris

away from the workpiece.
Method according to claim 1 characterized in that
the wavelength of the radiation is less than about

800 nm.
Method according to claim 1 or 2 characterized in
that the wavelength of the radiation ranges between

about 200 nm and 800 nm.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3
characterized by placing an optical filter between

the flashlamp and the workpiece such that the
radiation passes through the optical filter, select

wavelengths of the radiation not passing through
the filter.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 4
characterized in that the flashlamp comprises a

linear flashlamp with a tubular lamp body containing
xenon.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 5
characterized by positioning a layer proximate the

template to prevent debris from the workpiece from 
dispersing, the layer being disposed such that the

radiation from the flashlamp passes through the
layer before forming the pattern in the workpiece,

and the layer permitting sufficient radiation
transmission such that the flashlamp is capable of

forming the shaped image.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 6
characterized in that the workpiece comprises a

substrate with a coating of magnetic or conductive
metal.
Method according to claim 7 characterized in that
the substrate comprises a homogeneous polymer

selected from the group consisting of polyester,
polycarbonate, polyethylene, polyethylene

terephthalate, polyamide and polyimide.
An apparatus for creating a shaped image in a workplace
comprising:


a template proximate the workpiece and
a linear flashlamp proximate the template,
wherein the flashlamp emits radiation with a

wavelength of less than about 800 nm during a
short pulse of approximately 100 µsec or less

and directed through the template toward the
workpiece.
The apparatus according to claim 9 characterized by
the features of any one of claims 3 to 8.
