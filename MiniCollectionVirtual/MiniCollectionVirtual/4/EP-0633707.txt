Remotely controllable communications system
(KS) having a central computer device (ZRE) to which,

via at least one PCM-oriented system bus interface
(PCM), at least one subscriber line unit (TAE), which

can be connected to communications terminals (VAE), and
at least one trunk line unit (VAE) are connected and,

for the purposes of information interchange for
remotely controlling the communications system this

communications system can be connected via a
communications network to a service centre,

in that a remote transmission module (FUM), which can
be set for communications-network-specific information

transmission and signalling, is arranged in the
communications system (KS) for the purpose of

information interchange with the service centre (SZE),

in which there is a computer bus interface (BZR)
which is connected to a computer bus interface

(BZR) of the central computer device (ZRE) and via
which wanted information (ni) and control

information (si) are transmitted in accordance
with a defined protocol, and
in which there is a PCM-oriented system bus
interface (PCM), which is connected to a PCM-oriented

system bus interface (PCM) of the central
computer device (ZRE), and via which the wanted 

information (ni) and signalling information (si)
are transmitted.
Remotely controllable communications system
according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that the remote transmission module (FUM) is formed
by


an access memory (DPR), which coordinates the
information interchange between the central

computer device (ZRE) and the remote transmission

a modem unit (ME), which modulates and demodulates
wanted information (ni) for the purposes of

analogue information transmission and has a
processor interface (MPS) and an analogue remote

speech interface (a/b)
a signalling coding/decoding and filter unit

having an analogue remote speech interface (a/b),
which is connected to the analogue remote speech

interface (a/b) of the modem unit (ME), and an
internal, ISDN-oriented system bus interface

(IOM2),
a peripheral controller (ELIC) which effects the
switching of the wanted information (ni) and

coordinates the signalling information (si),

which has an internal, ISDN-oriented system bus
interface (IOM) which is connected to the

internal, ISDN-oriented system bus interface
(IOM) in the SICOFI unit (SICOFI),
a processor interface (MPS) and
a PCM-oriented system bus interface (PCM),
and by a microprocessor system (MS) which controls
and monitors the remote transmission module (FUM)

transmission module (FUM) for different

communications networks (KN), the processor
interface (MPS) of which microprocessor system 

(MS) is connected via a microprocessor bus (MPB)

a signalling channel controller (DA) which
provides the internal, ISDN-oriented system bus

interface (IOM) and controls the signalling
information (si),
a switching unit (EPIC) which switches the wanted
information (ni) and provides at least one PCM-oriented

bus interface (PCM), and
an interface unit (SE) which transmits the
signalling information (si) and wanted information

(ni) in serial form and provides the processor
interface (MPS).
Remotely controllable communications system
