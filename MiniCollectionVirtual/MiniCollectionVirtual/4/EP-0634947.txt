<ABSTRACT>
An optical probe configured for insertion into the anterior chamber of an eye, adjacent to the cataractous lens of the eye, comprises an optical source (60) and an optical waveguide (100) connected to deliver optical radiation from the source to the probe. The optical radiation is in the form of pulses which have a repetition rate, a wavelength and an optical energy selected to cause significant ablation-induced damage to the lens within an ablation zone, and significant acoustic-induced damage to the lens within an acoustic zone, such that the acoustic zone is significantly larger in size than the ablation zone. The acoustic zone is created by generating shock waves which radiate from the ablation zone and propagate through hard nuclear material of the cataractous lens, such that the nuclear material is microfractured. The microfractured lens material is significantly more reactive to the laser pulses than prior to microfracturing, and the hard nuclear material readily disintegrates into small fragments in response to application of laser pulses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of laser probes for surgery.
More specifically, the present invention relates to laser probes used in eye surgery and
to surgical techniques for treating cataracts.Recently, attention has focused on the use of lasers to remove cataractous lens
tissue by ablation, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4, 846, 172 issued to
Berlin. Although soft tissues are relatively easy to ablate, the nucleus of a cataractous
lens is quite hard, and thus ablation of such nucleus material is time consuming and
tedious. In order to increase the speed of the photoablative process, the power of the
laser may be increased. However, such high power increases the risk of thermal
damage, particularly the chances of rupturing the posterior capsule of the eye and of
causing other damage to the surrounding eye tissues.In other cataract surgeries, various types of ultrasonic devices are used to
remove the lens. Typically, ultrasonic energy is directed against the lens of the eye to
separate the lens into large pieces which must be continuously broken down into smaller
pieces before they can be removed. In many prior art ultrasonic probes, aspiration is
provided through a coaxial aspiration port to attract large lens pieces to surface of the
ultrasonic probe, and hold the lens pieces in place, so they can be broken down into
smaller pieces by the ultrasonic waves. This process of attracting, and breaking the
pieces of the lens is repeated until the pieces are small enough to fit through the
aspiration port in the ultrasonic probe. The process of separating the lens into pieces,
and breaking the pieces into smaller pieces requires a high level of skill and is also very
time consuming. Therefore an improved lens removal procedure and apparatus is
needed. 
A laser-based probe for eye surgery having a substantially co-axial configuration of laser
delivery conduit and aspiration tube is described in WO 91/06271. Like the ultrasonic
devices, this probe uses the aspiration tube to hold the tissue to be treated against the
distal tip of the probe. Instead of transmitting ultrasonic energy to the probe tip, laser
energy is transmitted to the tip where it impinges upon a target mounted to the tip to
generate shockwaves that are conducted onto the tissue to break the tissue into small
pieces.A table top apparatus for eye examination and non-invasive minor cataract
surgery is described in US 4, 582, 405 and uses a laser to cause localised ablation to
break up protein fibrils of

An apparatus for removing a cataractous lens (216) of an eye with a
beam of optical energy, comprising:


an optical probe (119) configured for insertion into the anterior chamber of an
eye such that a distal tip of the probe is adjacent to the lens (216) of the eye, the optical

probe (119) comprising an elongate portion (120) having a focusing lens (124) at a distal
extremity thereof, the focusing lens (124) being disposed so as to focus the beam at a

focal point that is 0.3 mm to 1.3 mm forward of the distal tip of the probe;
