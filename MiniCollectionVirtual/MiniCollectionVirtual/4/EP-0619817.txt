<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel flavilium
derivatives of general formula (I)
wherein
Xis a non-toxic anion,R1 and R2are independently selected from hydrogen or -OY
group in which
Y is hydrogen, α-amino-acyl group or amino-alkyl
group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms;R5is hydrogen, α-amino-acyl group or amino-alkyl
group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms;R3, R4, and R7independently are hydrogen or alkyl group
of 1 to 5 carbon atoms,R6is hydrogen, hydroxy group or alkyl group of 1 to
5 carbon atoms.In the general formula (I) Y, R3, R4, R5 R6 and R7 can
be an alkyl group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms e.g. methyl,
ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl terc-butyl,
n-pentyl or isopentyl group, preferably methyl group; the
Á-amino-acyl group can be the acyl radical of an essential
amino acid, preferably glicyl, alanyl, lysyl or arginyl
group.The compounds of general formula (I) possess
outstanding selective anti-viral effect. Their effect
against HIV virus is particularly important; comparing
them to AZT they proved to be more effective and less
toxic.The flavanoids are well-known wide-spread colour substances
in the flora. Flavilium salts form a type of this
family of compounds. These salts are widely used in food
industry e.g. for colouring fruits and other vegetable
foods (e.g. German Patent No. 1,904,810, GDR Patent No.
140,353, US Patent No. 3,314,975). Medical application of flavilium derivatives, their
lipid and cholesterin level decreasing effect is described
in European Patent No. 19,524, German Patent No.
2,808,820, while the effect of flavilium chloride similar
to that of vitamin P is described in German Patents No.
2,002,421 and No. 2,703,375.Flavilium derivatives can be obtained from plant by
various extraction methods or by synthetic procedures.
According to one of synthetic methods a suitable phenol
derivative is condensed with a substituted chalcone or
phenyl-β-diketon e.g. pursuant to German Patent No.
1,904,810 and No. 2,808,823 or α-chloro-β-N,N-dimethylformimidoyl-styrene
perchlorate is used as a condensation
partner in order to produce 7-amino-flavilium salts, in
accordance with GDR Patent No. 140,353.According to the other possible way of reaction the
desired compounds are prepared from a natural vegetable
basic material by various reucing methods (Mg + sulfuric
acid, LiAlH4, Zn + acetic anhydride) (German Patents No.
2,002,421 and No. 2,703,375, European Patent No. 19,524
and Japanese Patent No. 55,036,679).According to our experience preparation of compounds of
general formula (I) can not be realized
