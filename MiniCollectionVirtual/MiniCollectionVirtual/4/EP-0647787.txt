<ABSTRACT>
One 3 of the end elastic articulations of the link rod is subjected to axial preload by virtue of a rigid wedge 14 interposed between the shank 1 of the link rod and an internal fastening core 8. When the link rod is mounted and subjected to a residual axial load Fd owing to the residual drive of the engine when the vehicle is stationary, the cushions 10 providing elasticity for this articulation can thus work in their low-stiffness operating range, which improves the filtering-out of vibration. Application to vehicles equipped with an automatic gearbox.

A torque take-up connecting rod for vehicle engine,
particularly for the pendular suspension of a power unit

with an automatic gearbox, of the type comprising, at least
at one of its ends, a flexible tubular joint (3), in other

words it comprises an inner fixing core (8) and at least one
cushion of flexible material (10) which by adhesion connects

the said core (8) to the inner surface of an outer tubular
frame (9), characterised in that the cushion(s) (10) is/are

subject to pre-stressing orientated in the principal
direction of the traction and compression stresses which act

on the connecting rod, in other words its axial direction,
the direction of the said pre-stressing being such that when

the connecting rod is subjected to a residual axial stress
(Fd) due to the motive force of the engine upon

deceleration, the automatic gear box being in the "drive"
(forward gear) position, the cushion(s) (10) resume the form

in which their function point (P') is situated approximately
in the middle of their range (r) of minimal stiffness.
A connecting rod according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the pre-stressing of the cushion(s) (10) is maintained by a

rigid wedge (14) inserted between the body (1) of the
connecting rod and the said hub (8), substantially on the

axis of the connecting rod.
A connecting rod according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the said cushion(s) (10) are two in number and are

inclined on the axis of the connecting rod.
A connecting rod according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the moulding of the said

cushions (10) is such that after installation of the
connecting rod and application of the said residual axial 

stress (Fd), axial displacements of the said fixing hub (8)
restores them to the radial position.
A connecting rod according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that prior to installation, the

said pre-stressing is such that the geometrical axis of the
said fixing hub (8) is slightly offset axially in relation

to the geometrical axis of the said outer tubular frame.
A connecting rod according to any one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that it comprises a compression stop (15)

diametrally opposite the said wedge (14).
A connecting rod according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the said fixing hub (8) is

constituted by a flexible articulation and comprises a
central fixing arbor (11) and an intermediate tube (12)

connected to each other by flexible cushions (13) secured by
adhesion.
