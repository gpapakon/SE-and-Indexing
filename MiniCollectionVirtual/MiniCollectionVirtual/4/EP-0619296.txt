<DESCRIPTION>
The metabolic routes, in which various compounds are 
biosynthesized from the same mother compound, i.e. arachidonic 
acid, are called "Arachidonate cascade" as a whole. Arachidonic acid is metabolized by the action of lipoxygenase, 
e.g. 5-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, and 15-lipoxygenase, to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic 
acid (abbreviated as HPETE 
hereinafter), 12-HPETE and 15-HPETE, respectively. These HPETEs are converted into 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic 
acid (abbreviated as HETE hereinafter), 12-HETE and 15-HETE, 
respectively, by the action of peroxidase which convert a 
hydroperoxy group to a hydroxy group. Furthermore, LTA4 is also 
produced from 5-HPETE. LTA4 is converted into LTB4 and LTC4. 
LTC4 is converted into LTD4 by the action of γ-glutamyl 
transpeptidase. Moreover, it has been defined that LTD4 is 
metabolized to LTE4 (see Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 91, 1266 
(1979) and Prostaglandins, 19 (5), 645 (1980)). Moreover, the action of LTB4 has been gradually identified 
recently. Namely, it as been identified that LTB4 having the 
following structure: 
 
 
(wherein the double bonds between 6th- and 7th- carbon, 8th- and 
9th-carbon, 10th- and 11th- carbon and 14th- and 15th-carbon, are 
Z, E, E and Z, respectively), possesses a powerful action of 
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) accumulation and PMNLs 
adhesion, and PMNLs degranulation (see Nature, 286, 264 (1980), 
Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 78, 3887 (1981) and J.Biol. Chem., 256, 
5317 (1981)). Moreover it has been considered that LTB4 promotes 
the release of arachidonic metabilites by attacking various cells as 
it has the powerful action like calcium ionophore (see J. Biol. 
Chem., 257, 4746 (1982)). Moreover, LTB4 in high concentration has been detected at 
the sites of various inflammation, for example, rheumatism, spinal 
arthritis (see Klickstein L.B., Shapleigh, C. and Goetzl, E.J. (1980) 
J.Clin. Invest., 66, 1166-1170), gout (Rae, S.A., Davidson, E.M. and 
Smith, M.J.H. (1982) Lancet II 1122-1123), psoriasis (see Grabbe, 
J., Czarnetzki, B.M., Rosenbach, T. and Mardin, M. (1984) J. Invest. 
Dermatol., 82, 477-479), ulceractive colitis (see Sharon, P. and 
Stenson, W.F. (1984) Gastroenterology 86, 453-460), respiratory 
disease (see O'Driscoll, B.R., Cromwell, O. and Kay, A.B. (1984) Clin. 
Exp., Immunol., 55, 397-404). The fact described above shows that 
LTB4 is deeply related to various inflammation. Accordingly, the antagonistic agents on LTB4 are considered to 
be useful as anti-inflammatory agents and
