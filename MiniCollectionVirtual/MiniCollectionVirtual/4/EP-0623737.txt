<ABSTRACT>
Variable timing device for controlling an inlet or exhaust valve of an internal combustion engine, comprising: two operating cams carried by the same camshaft, and the profile of one of which can be inscribed within the profile of the other, first and second separate rocker levers (1, 2) mounted side by side on one and the same rocker arm assembly (4) and interacting with the said cams, the second lever (2) which can translate along the rocker arm assembly (4) being able to be coupled selectively to the said first lever (1) under the action of operating means in order to obtain greater lift of the valve, characterised in that the operating means for coupling and uncoupling the second lever (2) with and from the first one (1) comprise two antagonist thrust assemblies (5; 13, 12, 11) located coaxially to the rocker arm assembly (4).
