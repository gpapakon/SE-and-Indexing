<ABSTRACT>
In a method for tuning a sensor coil (80) for a 
fiber optic gyroscope, the coil (80) is initially wound 

in a known pattern. One end (98, 100) of the fiber of 
the wound coil is then adjusted relative to the other end 

so that a known differential is obtained that effectively 
displaces the midpoint of the winding pattern. The coil 

is then attached to an interferometer test apparatus (76-92) 
and performance measured. After successive 

observations a "trimmed" coil is obtained of acceptable 
performance characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fiber optic 
gyroscopes. More particularly, this invention pertains to 
a method for tuning the gyro sensor coil to eliminate non-reciprocity 
error sensitivities. A fiber optic gyroscope comprises the following 
main components: (1) a light source, (2) a beamsplitter 
(either a fiber optic directional coupler or an 
integrated-optics Y-junction), (3) a fiber optic coil, (4) 
a polarizer (and sometimes one or more depolarizers), and 
(5) a detector. Light from the light source is split by 
the beamsplitter into copropagating and counterpropagating 
waves travelling in the sensing coil. The associated 
electronics measures the phase relationship between the 
two interfering, counter-propagating beams of light that  
 
emerge from opposite ends of the coil. The difference 
between the phase shifts experienced by the two beams 
provides a measure of the rate of rotation of the platform 
to which the instrument is fixed. Environmental factors can affect the measured 
phase shift difference between the counterpropagating 
beams, thereby introducing a bias or error. Such 
environmental factors include variables such as 
temperature, vibration (acoustical and mechanical) and 
magnetic fields. Such factors are both time-varying and 
unevenly distributed throughout the coil. These 
environmental factors induce variations in the optical 
light path that each counterpropagating wave encounters as 
it travels through the coil. The phase shifts induced 
upon the two waves are unequal, producing a net 
undesirable phase shift which is indistinguishable from 
the rotation-induced signal. While appropriate coil winding techniques can 
minimize some of the bias errors found in the output of 
a fiber optic gyro, in practice it is not possible to 
attain a "perfect" winding pattern. Bumps, wrinkles and 
various errors will invariably occur in winding. To the 
extent that such asymmetries exist, winding patterns are  
 
rarely as intended and the reduction of output bias is 
inherently limited. That is, while an intended symmetric 
coil winding pattern may locate similarly situated fiber 
segments equal lengths from the fiber center, in practice 
the theoretical cancellation of Shupe error due to 
temperature change is not observed. Rather, the presence 
of such difficult-to-avoid winding errors as "drop outs" 
and the like regularly frustrate the fabrication of a 
perfectly symmetric sensor coil. Such winding errors are 
to be expected in view of the quite substantial task 
involved in the
