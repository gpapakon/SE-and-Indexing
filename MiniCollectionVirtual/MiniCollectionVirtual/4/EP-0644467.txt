<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an organic photo-sensitive body for electrophotography, and, in 
particular, to a conductive cylindrical supporting body therefor. This invention also relates to a manufacturing 
method of the conductive cylindrical supporting body. A photo-sensitive body of electrophotography that is used for an electrophotography device such 
as a copier or printer to which electrophotography technology is applied comprises a conductive 
supporting body and a photo-sensitive layer provided thereon and consisting of an organic material containing an 
organic photoconductive material. The conductive supporting body is usually 
cylindrical for the convenience of the design of the device, and the photo-sensitive layer is coated and 
formed on its outer surface. Conventional materials for the cylindrical supporting body use aluminum or its alloy that has 
a relatively light weight and a good machinability. However, Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 2-17026 discloses a supporting body 
manufactured by an injection-molding method using a material containing a polyphenylenesulfide 
resin (simply referred to as PPS below) as a main component, the supporting body that has a 
light weight and good chemical and thermal resistance, is not oxidized or otherwise deteriorated in 
the air, and is thus preferable for an organic photo-sensitive body. Supporting bodies composed of aluminum or its alloy require individual high 
accuracy machining to obtain a rigid dimensional accuracy (+50µm or less in roundness and +40µm 
in the accuracy of diameter) and a preferable surface roughness (1µm or less at the max. 
height (Rmax)), and also require individual machining of a spigot into which a flange for rotatably  
 
driving a photo-sensitive body is fitted; have a disadvantage that the surface is oxidized or deteriorated 
due to the effect of moisture or oxygen in the air; require to prevent deterioration, for example, 
by forming an anodic oxidized coat on the surface; and thus require many steps and costs in 
manufacturing process. Supporting bodies composed of PPS resin as a main component have the 
following disadvantages. Since the volume resistivity of a PPS resin is high, that is, usually 1010 
to 1013 Ω cm, a carbon black is added to the PPS resin to provide conductivity. The market has 
recently been making demands on image quality and printing characteristics. Investigations into 
the conductivity of supporting bodies 
required to obtain as good image quality and printing characteristics as
