<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for preserving the sequential relationship of a plurality of data packets (310) generated by separate source devices (14) and ordered as a data stream (300), despite transmission over radio channels which introduce ordering errors comprises method steps and apparatus structure for identifying at a first terminal, data packets from within the data stream as a function of source, generating data packet sequence information for identified data packets, storing values corresponding to data packet sequence numbers as function of source and transmitting data packets, source device identity and packet sequence information to a second terminal having first terminal source device and data packet sequence information. Upon receipt of a first terminal transmission, the second terminal retrieves from second terminal memory, first terminal data packet sequence information and compares the stored data packet sequence information with received data packet sequence information. As a function of the comparison, received data packets are forwarded to an appropriate application for further processing when sequence information sequence numbers compared and stored in an order determined by the sequence information when the sequence numbers do not compare.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to a radio
frequency (RF) packet transmission system in which data
is transmitted by packets and is specifically directed
to a method and apparatus which preserves data stream
packet sequencing.Businesses which have adopted RF Local Area
Networks (LAN) transmit data using RF communications.
FIG. 1 illustrates a typical RF packet transmission
system comprising a wireless LAN in which control module
(CM) 10 utilizes RF communications to communicate with a
plurality of user modules (UM) 12. Each UM 12 is
connected to one or more user devices 14 such as a
terminal, personal computer or other information
input/output device via connection 16. The CM 10 is
connected to data network 18 by data channel 20 which
may include, but is not limited to wires or optical
links.The CM 10 controls communications within the
illustrated network and passes information from data
network 18 to user devices 14 via an associated UM 12.
The CM 10 also controls local communications by
receiving information from one UM 12A and relaying the 
information to a different UM 12B. Data network 18 may
consist of an Ethernet network, a Token Ring network, or
any of the other of the well known data networks.In the packet transmission system of FIG. 1,
information such as the information passed between UM 12
and a user device 14 or between CM 10 and data network
18, is conveyed in the form of data packets multiplexed
into a data stream. Wireless information such as the
information transmitted between UMs 12 and CM 10, is
conveyed in the form of radio transmission packets.
Each radio transmission packet typically contains a
preamble and an information field. The preamble may
comprise control data, synchronization information
and/or destination device information. The information
field contains at least some of the information
comprising a data packet.By way of example, assume two terminal devices 14
serviced by a common UM 12 transmit an equal number of
packets, N/2, over wire 16. Further assume that N is 10.
Then each terminal device 14 connected to UM 12 will
transmit 5 packets which collectively combine to create
the multiplexed data stream 300 of FIG. 3.Continuing with this example, a first terminal
device 14, designated as terminal A, transmits 5 packets
numbered 0-4, while a second terminal 14, designated as
terminal B, transmits 5 packets numbered 0-4. When
transmitted over the wire 16, these 10 packets A0-A4 and
B0-B4 are typically interspersed in a random nature,
such as:
