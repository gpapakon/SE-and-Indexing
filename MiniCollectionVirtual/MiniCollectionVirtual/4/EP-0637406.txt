<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR EFFICIENT OPERATION OF A SOLID-STATE LASER OPTICALLY PUMPED BY AN UNSTABLE RESONATOR SEMICONDUCTOR LASERTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to solid-state lasers optically pumped by semiconductor lasers and, in particular, to a method and an apparatus for generating useful laser output from a solid-state laser optically pumped by an unstable resonator semiconductor laser.Background of the InventionA variety of methods have been employed for optically pumping solid-state lasers, such as neod/mium- doped lithium yttrium fluoride (Nd:YLF) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Ndr AG) . A common method is to use an arc lamp or other similar light source to excite a laser rod. The light source and laser rod are positioned within and at different foci of a highly reflective housing of elliptical cross-section. This method typically requires relatively large diameter laser rods to efficiently absorb enough of the pumping light emitted by the light source to allow solid-state laser operation. Another limitation of this pumping method is the relative inefficiency caused by poor overlap of the optical emission spectrum of the pumping light source with the absorption bandwidth of the solid-state lasants.This method typically entails the use of arc- pumped, solid-state lasers, which commonly require water 

cooling systems that place a severe cumbrance on clean room environments typically preferred for link processing of dynamic random access memory devices performed by, for example, arc-pumped, Q-switched, NdrYAG lasers. There are several different methods for diode- pumping solid-state lasers. In U.S. Patent No. 3,982,201, Rosenkrantz et al. describe a solid-state laser that is pumped by single diode lasers or arrays of diode lasers to which the solid-state laser rod is directly end-coupled. Because the output wavelength of the diode laser array is a function of its temperature, the diode lasers are operated in a pulsed mode at a low duty cycle to maintain the array at a sufficiently stable temperature so that its output wavelength remains matched to the absorption bandwidth of the solid-state laser rod. The output power characteristics of this laser system are limited by the . relatively inefficient match between the output of the diode lasers and the mode volume of the solid-state laser rod. In "Efficient LiNdP4012 Lasers Pumped with a LaserDiode," Applied Optics, vol. 18, No. 23 (Dec. 1, 1979), Kubodera and Otsuka describe the well-known practice of collecting the
