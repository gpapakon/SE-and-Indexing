<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to solenoid operated fluid valves and is 
herein specifically disclosed as an improvement in a valve for the 
high-pressure, direct injection of a volatile fuel such as gasoline into a 
two-stroke internal combustion engine. The ability of a fuel injector to respond to an input signal's command to 
open is a significant factor in the fuel injector's ability to deliver a precise 
injection of fuel to a combustion chamber. Parameters that define the fuel 
injector's magnetic circuit (e.g., the stator, the armature, and the working gap 
between the stator and the armature) are of particular importance since it is 
this magnetic circuit that conducts the magnetic flux that exerts the magnetic 
force which acts on the armature. The rate at which the magnetic flux builds 
determines the rate at which force acting on the armature builds. The faster 
the force builds, the faster the fuel injector opens. While it is recognized that magnetic flux cannot be built 
instantaneously, it has been conventional practice to use various fuel injector 
driver circuits that seek to maximize the building of electric current in the 
solenoid's coil in the expectation that this will necessarily also maximize the 
rate at which magnetic flux is built in the magnetic circuit, and as a 
consequence also minimize the fuel injector's opening time. It has now been discovered that the transient building of magnetic flux 
does not occur uniformly over the transverse cross sectional area of the 
magnetically conductive material (i.e. the stator and armature) in the valve's 
magnetic circuit. Rather, flux must build first in the magnetically conductive 
material's "skin" before it can build in the interior of the material's cross 
section. This phenomenon is a physical characteristic of the magnetic circuit 
material and is in the nature of a time constant (albeit a small one) that delays 
the propagation of flux into the interior of the cross section. For convenience 
it will be referred to herein as the flux propagation delay characteristic. 
Consequently, for a given magnetic circuit structure, the building of flux at any 
given point within a transverse cross section of the structure in response to  
 
the building of current in the coil, is a transient phenomenon that is a function 
of the input current to the coil as a function of time and the particular location 
of that point within the cross section. The flux propagation delay 
characteristic is an inherent constraint on the ability of a magnetic

A valve (10) comprising: 

a valve housing (12) comprising an inlet port (30); 
a valve seat (14) disposed circumscribing an outlet port (16) in said 
housing; 
a valve member (26) that coacts with said seat to control flow 
through said outlet port; 
a solenoid coil (48) having an inside diameter and an outside 
diameter; 
stator means (20) comprising an inner stator tube (52) disposed 
coaxial within the inside diameter of said solenoid coil, an outer stator tube 

(54) disposed coaxial over the outside diameter of the solenoid coil, and a 
transverse stator end wall (56) disposed coaxially over one axial end of 

said solenoid coil and extending radially between said inner and said outer 
stator tubes; 
an armature (22) disposed coaxially at the opposite axial end of 
said solenoid coil and separated from said stator means by a magnetic 

gap (62,64) for positioning said valve member relative to said seat when 
attracted toward said stator means by energization of said solenoid coil; 
each of said stator tubes (52,54) having a respective radially inner 
cylindrical surface and a respective radially outer cylindrical surface, said 

transverse stator end wall having one surface facing axially toward said 
solenoid coil and another surface facing away from said solenoid coil, and 

said armature having an axial face that faces toward said coil and said 
stator means; 
at least one of said cylindrical surfaces of 
each of said stator tubes has a series of slots (70,86) that extend axially 

from said magnetic gap to said transverse stator end wall, 
at least one of said axial faces of said transverse stator end wall 
has a series of radial slots (87) extending radially between said inner and 

outer stator tubes,

slot does not pass through to the opposite cylindrical surface of its 

respective stator tube,

the end wall's skin so that each said end wall slot does not pass through 
to the opposite axial face of the stator end wall;
 
   and said armature slots extend only into the skin of said axial face 

of said armature so as not to protrude axially through said armature.
