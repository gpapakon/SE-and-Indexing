<ABSTRACT>
A thymus-derived factor from clonal mammalian cell lines of thymic origin, known as TISF, which stimulates, enhances or regulates cell-mediated immune responsiveness, which is preferably substantially homogeneous and purified, and which enhances proliferation and differentiation of lymphocyte and other hematopoietic progenitors and which enhances the response of animals, especially mammalian organisms, to infectious agents and to malignancies. Also disclosed are methods for using TISF in treatment or prevention of disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the fields of immunology and molecular biology, and
particularly to a polypeptide factor which stimulates or regulates the proliferation and differentiation of
lymphocyte and other hematopoietic progenitors and which enhances the response of animals to
infectious agents and to malignancies.The function of the thymus gland, which lies just beneath the breast bone, was only first
revealed in 1960. Prior to that time, the thymus was thought to be of little importance since in adults
it is almost non-existent because of rapid atrophy after adolescence. As was the case with other organs
(e.g., the pancreas), the function of the thymus was suggested by observing the effect of its removal in
young animals. When pre-adolescent animals are thymectomized, they experience a profound "wasting
disease" which is characterized by a variety of maladies, including increased incidence of infection and
cancer, failure to grow, allergies and neuromuscular paralysis. The greater susceptibility to infection and
cancer was shown to be directly attributable to a dramatic decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes.
and could be prevented by rearing the animal in a germ-free environment. However, the other
symptoms of thymectomy were not completed abrogated by this approach.In 1964, it was demonstrated that hormone-like factors from thymus tissue could prevent many
of the manifestations of "wasting disease." thus suggesting that the thymus produces substances important
in the development of immunity. The relationship of this observation to the other "wasting disease"
symptoms was not well understood at that time, however.B and T lymphocytes are the primary effector cells of the immune responses. Both cell classes
are considered to derive ultimately from hematoporetic stem cells in the mammalian bone marrow, via
progenitor or precursor cells representing distinguishable stages in the differentiation of each class. B
lymphocytes, or B cells, are the precursors of circulating antibody-secreting plasma cells Mature B
cells, which are characterized by expression of surface-bound immunoglobulin capable of binding specific
antigens, derive from hematopoietic stem cells via an intermediary cell class known as pre-B cells
Mature T cells develop principally in the thymus, presumably from an as-yet unidentified precursor cell
which migrates from the bone marrow to the thymus at an early stage of T lymphocyte developmentIt was not until 1971 that it was discovered that the thymus-derived lymphocytes
