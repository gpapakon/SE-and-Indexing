<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sulfate ester of N-acetylneuraminic
acid homopolymer, a method for producing
the same, a medicament effective for treating human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) comprising the sulfate ester
as an active ingredient (anti-HIV agent),
the sulfate ester
for use to treat AIDS and use of the sulfate ester to
produce the medicament.Although the number of patient of Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) caused by HIV is
rapidly increasing, an effective method for treating AIDS
has not been established yet. Because of high mortality
thereof after crisis, there is an urgent demand for
searching an anti-HIV agent.Azidothymidine and like reverse transcriptase
inhibitors, and heparin and like sulfated polysaccharides
capable of suppressing infection of HIV to a target cell 
are exemplified as a known anti-HIV agent (see, Japanese
unexamined patent publication Nos. 215529/1987;
7577/1990; and 91027/1992).Although azidothymidine and like reverse
transcriptase inhibitors inhibit increase of HIV, the
inhibitors have a strong side effect because of an action
thereof on nucleic acid synthesis. A long-term
administration is, therefore, difficult. In contrast,
heparin and like sulfated polysaccharides having been
used as an anticoagulant have a strong anticoagulant
activity relative to an anti-HIV activity. The sulfated
polysaccharides have a very strong anticoagulant activity
at a concentration where the polysaccharides exhibit an
anti-HIV activity. Development of the sulfated
polysaccharides as an anti-HIV agent is difficult due to
the side effect thereof (anticoagulant activity).It is an object of the present invention to
provide a medicament having an excellent anti-HIV
activity and being free of a side effect.The inventors conducted extensive research in
considering the problems of the prior art, and found that
a novel sulfate ester of N-acetylneuraminic acid
homopolymer is very weak in side effects, such as an
anticoagulant activity, at a dose of exhibiting an anti-HIV 
activity.Thus, the invention provides a sulfate ester of
N-acetylneuraminic acid homopolymer represented by the
following formula (I):

[wherein R represents, the same or different, a hydrogen
atom or SO3H, n is an integer of 5 to 1,000, provided
that the number of SO3H residues per 1 unit of
N-acetylneuraminic acid is 0.1 to 3.] and a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.Further, the invention provides a method for
producing a sulfate ester of N-acetylneuraminic acid
homopolymer represented by the following formula
