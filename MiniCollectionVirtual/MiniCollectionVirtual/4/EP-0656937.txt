<ABSTRACT>
Solid, weakly alkaline, phosphate- and chlorine-free products for dish-washing machines contain organic water-soluble builders, alkali carbonate, oxygen-based bleaching agents, surfactants and if required further usual components. In order to avoid the inconvenient formation of lime deposits in the dish-washing machines used, and in particular on the washed dishes, washing products are disclosed which contain oxidation products of polyglucosanes and/or their soluble salts as builder components.

<CLAIMS>
A solid, low-alkali, phosphate- and chlorine-free 
machine dishwashing detergent containing organic watersoluble 

builder, oxygen-based bleaching agent, surfactant 
and if desired other typical constituents, characterized 

in that it contains 10% by weight to 30% by weight of 
alkali metal carbonate, 30% by weight to 50% by weight of 

alkali metal hydrogen carbonate and, as builder component, 
5% by weight to 60% by weight of a polymer of 

anhydroglucose units which consists at least partly of 
oxidized anhydroglucose units corresponding to structural 

formulae I, II and/or III: 

 
containing one, two or three carboxyl groups and/or 

soluble salts thereof per unit. 
A detergent as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the content of oxidized anhydroglucose units corresponding 

to formulae I, II and/or III in the polyglucosan 
derivatives is at least 25 mole-%, preferably at least 35 

mole-% and more preferably at least 40 mole-%, the upper 
limit to the content of these oxidized anhydroglucose  

 
units being at around 100 mole-% and, more particularly, 

95 mole-%. 
A detergent as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that it contains as builder oxidation products 

of polyglucosans of which - on a statistical average - at 
least 15 mole-% consist of oxidized anhydroglucose units 

corresponding to formula I and which have average molecular 
weights below 15,000 and/or soluble salts thereof. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that it contains builders based on the 

selectively oxidized polyglucosans in quantities of 10% 
by weight to 40% by weight, based on the total weight of 

the detergent. 
A detergent as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that it contains no more than 10% by weight of watersoluble 

organic complexing agents from the group of 
synthetic polymeric carboxylates and, preferably, is at 

least substantially free therefrom. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it contains other complexing 

agents, such as citric acid or alkali metal citrates 
and/or the salts of nitrilotriacetic acid, at most in 

quantities of not more than 30% by weight and, more 
particularly, not more than 10% by weight, if at all. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that it contains 


15% by weight to 30% by weight of oxidation products of 
polyglucosans, 
40% by weight of alkali metal carbonate and alkali metal 
hydrogen carbonate, 
5% by weight to 15% by weight of alkali metal perborate 
and/or percarbonate, 
2% by weight to 10% by weight and, more particularly, 1% 
by weight to 5% by weight of bleach activator, 
0.5% by weight to 5% by weight and, more particularly,  
 
0.8 to 3% by weight of surfactant, more particularly 
nonionic surfactant, 
up to 30% by weight and, more particularly, 5% by weight 
to 20% by weight of alkali metal silicate, 
not more than 5% by weight and, more particularly, 2% by 
weight to 4% by weight of enzyme, 
not more than 5% by weight and, more particularly, 0.5% 
by weight to 2% by weight of fragrance. 
A powder-form or granular detergent as claimed in 
any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it has an 

apparent density of 750 g/l to 1,000 g/l. 
A process for the production of a tablet-form 
detergent having the composition claimed in any of claims 

1 to 7, characterized in that all its constituents are 
mixed in a mixer and the resulting mixture is tabletted 

in a tablet press under pressures of 200·10
5
 Pa to 
1,500·10
5
 Pa. 
A process for the production of the detergents 
claimed in claim 8 in powder form and/or granular form 

with apparent densities of 750 to 1,000 g/l, characterized 
in that, in a first process step, the builder 

component is mixed with at least part of the liquid 
mixture components, an increase in apparent density being 

obtained, surplus moisture, if any, is removed and the 
premix is subsequently combined with the other components 

of the dishwashing detergent. 
A process as claimed in claim 10, characterized in 

that liquid surfactant compounds, more particularly 
corresponding nonionic surfactants, solutions of fragrances 

in carrier liquids and/or water or aqueous solutions 
of mixture components, more particularly aqueous alkali 

metal silicate solutions, are used as the liquid phase in 
the first stage of the process. 
A process as claimed in claim 10 or 11, characterized 
in that, where the mixture of active substances  

 
is granulated, the granules obtained are powdered and 

spheronized in a final step with powder-form alkali metal 
silicate and/or alkali metal carbonate.
