<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a dynamic memory comprising a plurality of cells (MN, MN', C) with capacitances (C), which are connected by columns to bit lines (BL, BL') and by rows to selection lines (RW, RW'). One even row and one odd row contain reference cells (MND, MND', C), the cells of the other rows being memory cells. According to the invention, the capacitances (C) of the reference cells are equal to the capacitances of the memory cells, and means are provided in order, before reading a memory cell from an even row, to connect the selection line (RWD, RWD') of the odd row of reference cells to an element (REF) having the same capacitance as a selection line, but precharged to the state opposite that of the selection line of the odd row of reference cells.

A dynamic memory including:

a plurality of cells (MN, MN', C) including
capacitors (C) connected by columns to bit lines (BL, BL') and by

rows to selection lines (RW, RW'), an even column of each pair of
columns containing cells (MN, C) of respective even rows, and an

odd column of each pair of columns containing cells (MN', C) of
respective odd rows;
an even row and an odd row containing reference cells
(MND, MND', C), the cells of the other rows being memory cells;
means (MP1, MP1') for precharging the bit lines (BL,
BL') at a predetermined state (Vdd) before reading;
means for selecting, when reading, the odd row of the
reference cells simultaneously with any one of the even rows of

the memory cells; and
a comparator (10) associated with each pair of
columns, receiving the two bit lines of the pair of columns;
the capacitors (C) of the reference cells have the
same value as the capacitors of the memory cells; characterized

in that means are provided for, prior to reading a memory cell of
an even row, connecting the selection line (RWD, RWD') of the odd

row of reference cells to an element (REF) having the same
capacitance as a selection line, but which is precharged at the

state opposite to the state of the selection line of the odd row
of the reference cells.
The dynamic memory of claim 1, wherein said element
is a dummy selection line having the same characteristics as the

other selection lines.
The dynamic memory of claim 2, including two first
transistors (MN5, MN5') to connect respectively the selection

lines (RWD, RWD') of the reference cells to the dummy selection
line (REF), and means to control either one of said first

transistors when the bit lines (BL, BL') are precharged.
The dynamic memory of claim 1, including second
transistors (MC, MC') to initialize the capacitors of the 

reference cells, and means to control the second transistors of
the odd row of reference cells once an arbitrary even row of

memory cells has been selected.
The dynamic memory of claim 1, including, for each
selection line of the reference cells, third and fourth

transistors (MP2, MP2'; MN3, MN3') to respectively restore said

selection line to an active state (Vdd) and an inactive state
(0), and means to control the third transistor of the odd row

when an even row of memory cells is selected, and to control the
fourth transistor of the odd row once the even row of the memory

cells has been selected.
The dynamic memory of claim 2, including a fifth
transistor (MP4) to restore the dummy selection line (REF) to an

active state (Vdd), and means to control this fifth transistor
when an arbitrary row is selected.
