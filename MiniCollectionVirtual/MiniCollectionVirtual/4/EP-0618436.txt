<ABSTRACT>
System and method for filtering a misfire data stream 
having numerical values that indicate whether a firing of a 

cylinder was a misfire or a proper firing, to yield an 
optimum measurement misfire-rate for accurate and rapid 

determination of whether an engine (102) is misfiring beyond 
a threshold level. The method includes measuring firings of 

the cylinder during operation of the engine to produce 
measured cylinder firing signals, processing the measured 

cylinder firing signals received to produce a current 
misfire detection data stream of first and second logic 

signals, wherein the first logic signals indicate a current 
misfire condition and the second logic signals indicate a 

current normal firing of the engine, combining the current 
misfire detection data stream with previously detected and 

stored measured data representing an engine misfire rate, 
replacing the previously stored measured data by the 

combined current and previously stored data to produce a 
misfire rate output measurement, storing threshold values, 

comparing the combined current and previously stored data 
and the stored threshold values, generating an actuation 

signal if the combined current and previously stored data 
signal exceeds the stored threshold values, and indicating a 

misfire condition in the engine upon receiving the actuation 

signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a system
and method for filtering a misfire-detection data-stream
received from a multi-cylinder combustion engine, and more
specifically to filtering a misfire data stream received
during engine operation to yield an optimum measurement
misfire-rate for accurate and rapid determination of the
extent to which an engine is misfiring.Most automobiles employ a catalytic converter to reduce
the amount of pollutants in engine exhaust. However, when a
cylinder misfires (i.e., no or an incomplete combustion
occurs) unburned fuel escapes into the exhaust system. This
causes two problems: 1) tailpipe emissions of pollutants
increase; and 2) high amounts of unburned fuel enter the
catalytic converter causing excessive heat, which can
permanently damage or destroy the catalytic converter.The California Air Resources Board (CARB), as well as
other state and federal agencies, have identified engine
misfires as a contributor to vehicle emissions and a cause
of poor catalyst performance. They have instituted
regulations that require misfire detection systems be
implemented in automobile on-board diagnostics to alert
drivers (typically on the instrument panel), when a misfire
measurement rate exceeds a threshold mandated by such
agencies.The aim of the regulations is to determine an accurate
measurement of the misfire rate and to alert the driver as
soon as possible when a misfire rate exceeds thresholds
enumerated in the regulations. There are three important
parameters to consider in order to carry out the regulations
established by CARB and other agencies (hereinafter "CARB").
They are as follows: 1) threshold rate Rth (set by CARB - the
rate of misfire determined to cause emissions that are too
high; 2) time constant (set by CARB - the length of a
"window" over which measurements of the average misfire rate 
is taken); and 3) false alarm rate Rfa, which represents a
frequency of occurrence of normal firings which are
incorrectly classified as misfirings. It should be noted
that the false alarm rate Rfa is calculated internally by
misfire detection systems and should not be confused with
false indications of failures, which occurs when a misfire
detection system alerts an operator of a failure (that is,
the misfire measurement rate exceeding the threshold) based
on an incorrect determination that the misfire rate exceeds
a predetermined threshold (such an incorrect determination,
however, may be due to a high false alarm rate Rfa)CARB's desire to have the threshold rate
