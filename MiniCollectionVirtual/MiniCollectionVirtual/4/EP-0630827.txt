<ABSTRACT>
The two component container has an insert small container located in the top of the main container and with the cover secured by an external clamping ring (5). The edges of the small container and the cover are rolled over to form grip lips (10,11) for the L-shaped clamping ring to be secured. The L-shape is rolled into a C-shape to grip the lipped edges and the ends of the strip forming the ring are linked by tags. The small container sits in a shaped top of the main container and is secured by a similar outer clamping ring. The clamping rings are released by removing the tags allowing the components to be cleaned and recycled.

A packing for two-component products comprising a 
basic container (1) and a lid insert (13) insertable 

into the basic container (1) and closing the same in 
an air-tight manner, said lid insert (13) having an 

upper and a lower lid portion (4, 3) which are 
disposed one upon the other with their edge surfaces 

(10, 11) such that the lid portions (3, 4) form a 
common cavity, wherein the basic container (1) and the 

lid insert (13) are connected to one another by means 
of a tension ring (7) which engages over a curled edge 

surface (16) of the basic container (1), the edge 
surfaces (10, 11) of the upper and lower lid portions 

(3, 4) are curled downwardly, respectively, and a 
sealing is disposed between the edge surfaces (10, 11) 

of the lower and upper lid portions (3, 4), 
characterized in that the edge surface (10) of the 

lower lid portion (3) is curled towards the container 
axis, the lower and upper lid portions (3, 4) are 

removably connected to one another by means of a 
separable ring (5) covering the edge surfaces (10, 11) 

of the lower and upper lid portions from outside and 
fixed to the same, said ring being curled in such a 

manner that it engages behind the curled edge surface 
(10) of the lower lid portion (3), the tension ring  

 
(7) engages over the ring (5), and the upper lid 

portion (4) has a pouring aperture in its center. 
The packing according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the ring (5) is originally L-shaped in section 

and will be curled with its horizontal leg (19) in 
such a manner that it engages behind the curled edge 

surface (10) of the lower lid portion (3) while the 
vertical leg will be bent onto the plane edge surface 

(11) of the upper lid portion (4). 
The packing according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the ring (5), for closing, has a 

lug (16) in one end portion which passes through an 
aperture (18) in the other end portion and is bent 

over. 
The packing according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the ring (5) has an end tongue 

(17) for tearing the ring connection. 
The packing according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the upper lid portion (4) 

includes a central plane area and a sidewall area (12) 
extending from the central area upwardly and merging 

into the edge surface, said sidewall area sitting 
close to the sidewall area of the lower lid portion 

(3) from the inside in the closed condition of the lid 
insert (13). 
The packing according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a sealing for sitting close to 

the edge surface (16) of the basic container (1) is 
provided at the edge surface of the lower lid portion 

(3).
