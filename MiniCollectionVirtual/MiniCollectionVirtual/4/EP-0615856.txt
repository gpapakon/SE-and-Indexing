<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to recording sheets, such as transparency materials, 
filled plastics, papers, and the like. More specifically, the present invention is directed to 
recording sheets particularly suitable for use in ink jet printing processes.  
 JP-A-61,293,886 describes compositions for use in recording sheets comprising an 
imidazolinium salt. JP-A-61,277,484 describes ink jet recording materials containing a 
cationic compound and an amine compound. EP-A-0 439 363 discloses a paper which comprises a supporting substrate with a 
coating comprising (a) a desizing component selected from the group consisting of (1) 
hydrophilic poly(dialkylsiloxanes); (2) poly(alkylene glycol); (3) poly(propylene oxide) - 
poly(ethylene oxide) copolymers; (4) fatty ester modified compounds of phosphate, sorbitan, 
glycerol, poly(ethylene glycol), sulfosuccinic acid, sulfonic acid and alkyl amine; (5) 
poly(oxyalkylene) modified compounds of sorbitan esters, fatty amines, alkanol amides, castor 
oil, fatty acids and fatty alcohols; (6) quaternary alkosulfate compounds; (7) fatty imidazolines; 
and mixtures thereof, and (b) a hydrophilic binder polymer. The binder polymer may be a 
quaternary ammonium copolymer such as Mirapol WT, Mirapol AD-1, Mirapol AZ-1, Mirapol A-15, 
Mirapol-9, Merquat-100, or Merquat-550, available from Miranol Incorporated. EP-A-0,566,270 which constitutes a state of the art under Art. 54(3) EPC 
discloses a recording sheet which comprises a substrate; a first 
coating in contact with the substrate which comprises a crosslinking agent selected from the 
group consisting of hexamethoxymethyl melamine, methylated melamine-formaldehyde, 
methylated urea-formaldehyde, cationic urea-formaldehyde, cationic polyamine-epichlorohydrin, 
glyoxal-urea resin, poly (aziridine), poly (acrylamide), poly (N,N-dimethyl 
acrylamide), acrylamide-acrylic acid copolymer, poly (2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic 
acid), poly (N,N-dimethyl-3,5-dimethylene piperidinium chloride), poly (methylene-guanidine) 
hydrochloride, poly (ethylene imine) poly (ethylene mine) epichlorohydrin, poly (ethylene 
imine) ethoxylated, glutaraldehyde, and mixtures thereof; a catalyst; and a polymeric material 
capable of being crosslinked by the crosslinking agent and selected from the group consisting 
of polysaccharides having at least one hydroxy group, polysaccharides having at least one 
carboxy group, polysaccharides having at least one sulfate group, polysaccharides having at 
least one amine or amino group,
