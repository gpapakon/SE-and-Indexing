<ABSTRACT>
A support system for paper magazine comprises:
 

   a support surface 3;
 

   a paper feeder box 4;
 

   an upper paper guide 17a and a lower paper guide 17b both 
arranged over the support surface 3 before the paper inlet of the 

paper feeder box 4;
 

   a pair of magazine guides 20 mounted on the support surface 3 for 
guiding both sides of the paper magazine 2 during the loading;

 
   a lock cam 24 for swing movements to engage with and disengage 

from the cam engaging projection of the paper magazine 2 and urged by 
the yielding force of a spring to press the cam engaging projection 

towards the paper feeder box 4; and
 

   a lever holding mechanism 33 for holding the lock cam 24 in its 
unlock position after the return movement of a swing arm 28 is 

completed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a support system for
supporting a paper magazine carrying a roll of photographic
printing paper.There are known photograph printers for exposing a tape
of photographic paper (referred to as a paper) to optical
images of a negative film and subjecting it to developing
process for reproducing photographic images. In the operation
of printing, the paper wound on a reel is commonly
stored in and drawn out from a paper magazine which is
loaded on to the enclosure of an exposure unit.The paper magazine needs to be supplied with a new roll
of the paper upon consumption of the paper. Also, when a
different print size is requested, the paper magazine has to
be replaced with one suited for the size. It is therefore
essential to provide a support system for easing the loading
and unloading of the paper magazine on the enclosure.In a prior art system, a vertically placed paper feeder
box for communication with the paper magazine and a pair of
magazine guides for guiding the passage of the paper magazine
are provided on an approximately horizontal support
surface. For loading, the paper magazine is moved along and
between the two magazine guides to the paper feeder box so
that a paper outlet arranged in the upper front end of the
paper magazine comes to face a paper inlet provided in the 
upper feeding side of the paper feed box.When the paper magazine is placed in its loading position, it is locked by a
locking mechanism.The paper inlet of the feeder box of the prior art system is located in the upper
feeding side of the same. The leading end of the paper released from the paper output
of the paper magazine tends to go downward as having been wound on a reel and has
to be lifted up by hand to feed into the paper inlet of the paper feed box while the
paper magazine being advanced on the support surface to its loading position towards
the paper feed box. This loading action will require a considerable length of time with
troublesome adjustment.In addition, the paper outlet of the paper magazine is also located in the upper
front side of the same. If the paper magazine is tilted due to mechanical gaps between
the feet of the paper magazine and the magazine guides, its paper outlet comes in
misalignment with the paper inlet of the paper feed box thus preventing the leading
end of the paper from feeding from the paper inlet to a pair of advance rollers in the
paper feed box. As the paper magazine is biased between the two magazine guides
due to the mechanical gaps, it will hardly permit

<CLAIMS>
A support system for a photographic paper magazine, the support system
comprising:


a support surface (3) of an enclosure (1) of an exposure unit which is arranged
to accept a paper magazine (2) having a paper outlet (6) provided in the lower front

side thereof and a cam engaging projection (8) mounted to the bottom side of the
paper magazine (2) to be faced to the support surface (3);
a paper feeder box (4) disposed vertically at the front end of the support

surface (3) provided with a paper inlet (16);
an upper paper guide (17a) and a lower paper guide (17b) both arranged over
the support surface (3) before the paper inlet (16) of the paper feeder box (4) and

urged by springs (18, 19) for vertical swing movements with respect to the support
surface (3);
a pair of magazine guides (20) mounted on the support surface (3) for guiding
the paper magazine (2) during loading on said support surface (3);
a lock cam (24) mounted between the two magazine guides (20) and below the
support surface (3) for swing movements to a lock position to engage with the cam

engaging projection (8) of the paper magazine (2) and urged by the yielding force of a
spring (26) to press the cam engaging projection (8) and the paper magazine towards

the paper feeder box (4);
a swing arm (28) provided beside the passage of the paper magazine (2) for
lock cam return movement by the yielding force of a spring which is triggered by the un-loading

of the paper magazine (2); and
a lever holding mechanism (33) for holding the lock cam (24) in its unlock
position after the return movement of the swing arm (28) is completed.
