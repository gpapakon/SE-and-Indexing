<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUID LOSS ADDITIVES FOR CEMENTING COMPOSITIONSField of the Invention The present invention relates generally to oil well cementing compositions, methods for their use and specifically to fluid loss additives for such compositions.Description of the Related ArtIn well completion operations, a casing or liner is suspended in the borehole, and cement is pumped down the casing. The cement flows back up the annulus between the outside of the casing and the wall of the borehole. One problem encountered in this operation is the loss of fluid from the cement slurry into the earth contacting the cement. Such fluid loss causes the dehydrated cement slurry to have reduced strength and an uncontrollable setting rate. In addition, fluid loss can result in damage to the adjacent strata formation.Polymer compositions have commonly been added to cementing compositions as fluid loss additives. One prior art method discloses, for example, a fluid loss cement composition comprised of copolymers of acryla ide and N- viny1-2-pyrrolidone. Another prior art method discloses a cementing formulation comprised of a copolymer of N-vinyl- pyrrolidone and styrensulfonic acid and a cement dispersant composed of formaldehyde condensed naphthalene sulfonic acid.The prior art cementing compositions are deficient in that liquid fluid loss additives have a variety of drawbacks, e.g. objectionable odor, difficulty in pouring, lack of stability resulting in polymer solids settling, or excessively long thickening times at low temperature because of undesirable retarding effects. One important deficiency of most liquid loss additives is its pourability at low temperatures. For most aqueous-based liquid fluid loss additives, the additive becomes unpourable or frozen at around 32째F. Even before freezing, the viscosity of the additive may become so high so as to be impractical toSUBSTITUTE SHE! 

 handle. Oil-based fluid loss additives which do not freeze contain a gelling agent to keep the additive particles suspended for accurate metering. At low temperatures the oil-based additives become very viscous and different to handle. Thus, the need exists in the industry for a liquid cement fluid loss additive that will give desirable thickening times at low temperatures and improved stability for consistent performance.Summary of Invention According to one embodiment, the present invention provides cementing compositions which comprise: (a) hydraulic cement; (b) a N-vinylpyrrolidone-acrylamide random copolymer; and (c) a sulfonate containing
