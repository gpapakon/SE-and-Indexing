<ABSTRACT>
At least in the lower part (2) of the reactor pressure vessel, first partial regions (8) having a smaller wall thickness (a) and second partial regions (10) having greater wall thickness (A) are provided. The smaller wall thickness (a) is designed for the proper operation of the reactor pressure vessel. In the case of an overload, first one of these first partial regions (8) fails, then the next, by which means the destruction process progresses relatively slowly, so that no reaction surges of uncontrollable magnitude occur.

Reactor pressure vessel for a nuclear reactor 
which consists of a lower portion and an adjoining 

upper portion, characterised in that it has at least in 
the lower portion (2) first subregions (8, 12) with a 

lesser wall thickness (a, b) and second subregions (10, 
14) with a gre
ater wall thickness (A, B), the lesser 
wall thickness (a, b) being selected for a rated 

operation. 
Reactor pressure vessel according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the first subregions (8, 12) 

having a lesser wall thickness (a, b) are formed by 
means of recesses (18, 22) on the outer surface (16). 
Reactor pressure vessel according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the recesses (18, 22) are formed 

so as to be rounded inwards, in particular so as to be 
dome-shaped. 
Reactor pressure vessel according to claim 2 
or 3, characterised in that the recesses (18, 22) - 

when viewed in the direction of the outer surface 
(16) - have a symmetrical configuration and are, for 

example, formed so as to be round, elliptical or 
hexagonal. 
Reactor pressure vessel according to one of 
the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that all the first 

subregions (8, 12) are of the same size. 
Reactor pressure vessel according to one of 
the claims 1 to 5, characterised in that between 8 and 

30 first subregions (8) having a lesser wall thickness 
(a) are provided in the lower portion (2). 
Reactor pressure vessel according to one of 
the claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the first 

subregions (8, 12) having a lesser wall thickness (a, 
b) are symmetrically distributed. 
Reactor pressure vessel according to one of 
the claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the first  

 
subregions (12) having a lesser wall thickness (b) are 

also provided in the upper portion (4) which is 
preferably formed so as to be cylindrical. 
Reactor pressure vessel according to one of 
the claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the lesser 

wall thickness (a) in said first subregions (8) amounts 
to approximately 15 cm and the remaining wall thickness 

(A) amounts to approximately 25 cm, with a ferritic 
steel material being provided as the wall material. 
Reactor pressure vessel according to one of 
the claims 2 to 9, characterised in that the diameter 

of each of the recesses (18, 22) lies approximately in 
the range of 0.5 to 2 m. 
Reactor pressure vessel according to one of 
the claims 1 to 10, characterised in that a ring (26) 

is provided between the lower portion (2) and the upper 
portion (4) on the outer surface (16).
