<ABSTRACT>
The module comprises, grouped together on one and the same chassis (1):   - a loader (9) equipped with means for guiding a tray (3) and a means for moving this tray row by row; - a system (14) for ejecting the soil plugs, by means of push rods (15), the number of which is a submultiple of the number of soil plugs in one and the same row; - means (14) for taking in hand the soil plugs which have been ejected, these means being made up of an array of grippers (20), the number of which is equal to the number of soil plugs in one row of the tray (3), and means (18) for transferring the soil plugs to a planting device (19).

<CLAIMS>
A module for soil plug planter, for small blocks grown in rows and columns in
an alveolar plate, comprising, gathered on the same chassis (1):


a loader fitted on the one hand, with means to accommodate at least one plate (3)
arranged on a longitudinal plane, more or less vertical and parallel to the plantation line

(10), and on the other hand, with means for moving this plate from top to bottom, row by
row, as the emptying process progresses;
an ejection system (14) for the small blocks of the same row, by groups of small blocks
regularly spaced, each group comprising a number of small blocks which is a sub-multiple

of the total number of small blocks arranged in the same row of the alveolar plate;
means for picking up the group of ejected small blocks, and means to transfer (18) the
latter towards a planting device, whereby the said pick-up means consist of a set of claws

(20), whereas the said claws are operational in turn in order to pick up the said group of
ejected small blocks, characterised in that the number of claws is equal to the number of

honeycombs of the same row on the plate.
A module for soil plug planter according to claim 1, characterised in that the
ejection system (14) consists of horizontal pushers (15), whose number corresponds to the

number of small blocks belonging to the group to be extracted, whereby the said pushers
are gathered on the same bracket (16) which is mobile along two perpendicular axes : - a

transversal axis (36) to eject the small blocks out of their honeycombs, - a longitudinal axis
(38) to offset the pushers in order to eject the different groups of small blocks of the same

row (6), whereas the said bracket is actuated by a system of cams (40, 43) installed on a
single shaft (41) which is arranged longitudinally behind the plate (3).
A module for soil plug planter according to any of the claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that it comprises the set of claws (20) articulated round a shaft (21)

situated in front of the plate (3), parallel to the rows (6), whereas the said set of claws is 
actuated via a single shaft (22) comprising a set of cams (52, 53) to carry out at the same

time the tipping movement from the pick-up position and the release position, and the
opening and closing movement of the claws.
A module for soil plug planter according to claim 3, characterised in that the set
of claws (20) consists - of a sheet iron plate in which the fixed branches of the claws (67)

have been cut out , and - of mobile branches (68), whereas the said mobile branches are
articulated round a pivot (69) on the said plate and are connected to one another by a

control rod (24) which closes and opens the set of claws.
A module for soil plug planter according to claim 4, characterised in that the set
of claws (20) is covered partially with a plate (25) made of a flexible material such a

rubber, positioned to accommodate the foliage of the seedlings of the small blocks.
A module for soil plug planter according to claim 5, characterised in that it
comprises a rotary comb (26), positioned behind the set of claws (20) when it is in vertical

release position, whereas the said comb comprises teeth (27) which cause, thanks to the
flexible plate (25) the tipping of the small blocks (5) at release and, then, finally, the

evacuation of the small blocks from the claws, if the latter are not released naturally when
the said claws open.
A module for soil plug planter according to any of the claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the means (18) for transferring the ejected small blocks to the planting

device (19), comprise a worm conveyor, arranged longitudinally under the set of claws
(20), in front of the plane of the plate (3), whereas the said conveyor consists of

compartments (30) each formed by a plate (31) closed by a rim (32) at right angle arranged
transversally and by the rim (32) of the adjacent compartment, whereas the said plate (31)

forms a sole for accommodating the small blocks arranged transversally, whereby the
length of the said plates is equal to the space between two pushers (15), i.e. the interval

between two small blocks of the same row multiplied by the number of groups of small
blocks.
A module for soil plug planter according to any of the claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that it comprises a magazine (60) receiving the empty plates (3), whereas

the said magazine is arranged under the loader (9) and comprises a tilted bottom (61) for 
moving the empty plates outside the module, and a lever (62) for pushing the empty plate

automatically away, whereby the said lever is actuated by a counterweight (65) loaded by
the plate (3) which descends inside the magazine.
A module for soil plug planter according to any of the claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that it comprises a screen (50) arranged in front of the plate (3) above the
set of claws (20) and whose position is adjustable with respect to the said plate, to retain

the foliage of the seedlings of the small blocks, with the exception of the foliage of the
seedlings of the small blocks of the lowest row ready for ejection.
A planter for small blocks grown in alveolar plates, characterised in that it
comprises at least one plating module according to any of the claims 1 to 9.
