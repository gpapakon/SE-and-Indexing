<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic radial tire (1) has a double crown 
structure such that an annular recess portion (7) is 

arranged in the tread (6) at a given region in the 
widthwise direction thereof, in which the tread is 

divided into a central region (8), a middle region (9) 
and a side region (10), and at least one auxiliary 

reinforcing layer (5) is arranged on a belt (4) to as to 
substantially envelop a crown portion of the carcass (2) 

and the full outer surface of the belt, provided that a 
stretching ratio of cord in the auxiliary reinforcing 

cord layer (5) at positions corresponding to the central 
region (8) and side region (10) is equal to or greater 

than that at a position corresponding to the middle 
region (9), whereby the high-speed durability is 

improved together with the drainage property while 
controlling the increase of tire weight and cost as far 

as possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pneumatic radial 
tire having an improved high-speed durability while 
controlling increases of tire weight and cost as far as 
possible and having a tread in which an annular 
recess portion is arranged in the tread at a given 
region in the widthwise direction thereof. In general, it is known that a pneumatic 
radial tire having an annular recess portion in the 
widthwise center of the tread has a particularly good 
drainage property during running at high 
speeds. Since the drainage property improves 
as the volume of the annular recess portion becomes 
larger, the annular recess portion in the 
tire is 
preferably made as deep as possible, 
but it is restricted 
by the thickness of the tread. For this end, it is 
advantageous to make the depth of the annular 
recess portion deeper by depressing regions of the carcass and 
the belt at a position corresponding to the annular 
recess portion in the tread inward in the radial 
direction of the tire and along the circumference of the  
 
tread. There are also known pneumatic radial tires 
satisfying such a requirement. In the above conventional radial tires, the ends 
and central portion of the belt are apt to expand in the 
radial direction of the tire through centrifugal force 
during running at high speeds, and hence there is 
a danger of generating belt separation by the 
interaction between the above radial expansion and 
deformation produced during the running under load to this 
degrade the high-speed durability. Therefore, a cap 
layer covering the full outer surface of the belt, a 
narrow-width layer covering only the end portion of the 
belt, an auxiliary belt layer covering only the central 
portion of the belt or the like should be arranged as a 
belt reinforcing member, which increases the tire weight 
by the amount of the belt reinforcing member used 
as compared with tires having an ordinary belt structure 
to thus degrade the rolling resistance and fuel consumption. 
Thus, in the conventional radial tires it is desirable to 
improve the high-speed durability without increasing the 
tire weight and cost. Attention is also drawn to the disclosures of EP-A-0 465 786 and EP-A-0 
319 588. It is, therefore, an aim of the present invention to 
give improved high-speed durability to a pneumatic 
radial tire having a tread in which an annular 
recess portion is arranged in the tread at a given  
 
region in the widthwise direction thereof for developing 
good drainage property while controlling the 
increase of tire

A pneumatic radial tire (1) comprising a carcass (2) 
comprised of at least one rubberised cord ply, a belt 

(4) superimposed on the carcass and comprised of 
rubberized cord layers (3), the cords of which layers 

being crossed with each other, at least one auxiliary 
reinforcing cord layer (5) substantially enveloping a
