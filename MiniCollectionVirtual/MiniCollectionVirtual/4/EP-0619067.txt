<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method and 
apparatus for developing a uniform temperature gradient in a 

block of cheese. The apparatus includes a chamber (13) for 
receiving a cheese block. The chamber has a uniform cross 

section and has opposed openings separated by the length of 
the chamber. The chamber (13) is surrounded by insulation 

(15) on the peripheral surface between the openings. A heat 
exchange surface (17) is disposed over and closes one of the 

openings. A second heat exchange surface (23) is disposed 
over and closes the other of the openings. The temperature 

of the two heat exchange surfaces (17, 23) are different. 
When a block of cheese is disposed within the chamber (13), 

a temperature gradient can be established in the block of 
cheese in a relatively short period of time. Thereafter, 

the cheese block can be sliced into appropriate sections for 
determining moisture content as a function of cheese 

temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method 
and apparatus for developing a uniform temperature gradient 
in a block of cheese. It is common practice in the manufacture of 
cheddar and like types of cheese to produce the cheese in 
large blocks which are cooled from the manufacturing 
temperature of about 85°F (about 29.4°C) to a refrigerated 
temperature of about 40°F (about 4.4°C). Cheddar cheese, 
for example, is often produced in 640 pound (290.3 kg) 
blocks. Such large blocks of cheese take several days to 
cool from the manufacturing temperature of 85°F (29.4°C) to 
the cold room temperature of about 40°F (about 4.4°C). 
During the cooling period, a moisture gradient is 
established in the cheese. It has been found that there is 
a direct relationship between the quality throughout a block 
of cheese and the moisture gradient which is established in 
the cheese. It has been speculated that the moisture 
gradient is a function of the cooling rate and the 
temperature gradient which is established during the cooling 
period. It would be desirable to provide a method for 
studying the relationship of moisture and the temperature 
gradient throughout a block of cheese. It is not practical, 
however, to investigate the temperature gradient and 
moisture gradient in a large block of cheese. Consequently, 
the present invention is directed to a method and apparatus 
for developing a uniform temperature gradient in a 
relatively small block of cheese and investigating the 
function of the temperature gradient and the moisture 
gradient in a block of cheese.  FIGURE 1 is a schematic diagram of the 
apparatus of the present invention for establishing a 
uniform temperature gradient in a block of cheese. The present invention is directed to a method 
and apparatus for developing a uniform temperature 
gradient in a block of cheese. The apparatus includes a 
chamber for receiving a cheese block. The chamber has a 
uniform cross section and has opposed openings separated 
by the length of the chamber. The chamber is surrounded 
by insulation on the peripheral surface between the 
openings. A heat exchange surface is disposed over and 
closes one of the openings. A second heat exchange 
surface is disposed over and closes the other of the 
openings. The temperature of the two heat exchange 
surfaces are different. When a block of cheese is 
disposed within the chamber, a temperature gradient can 
be established in the block of cheese in a relatively 
short period of time. Thereafter, the cheese block can

Apparatus for developing a uniform temperature 
gradient in a block of cheese comprising a chamber (13) for 

receiving a cheese block, said chamber (13) having a uniform 
cross-section and said chamber having opposed openings 

separated by the length of said chamber (13), insulation 
(15) surrounding said chamber (13) on the peripheral surface 

between said openings, a first planar heat exchange surface 
(17) disposed over and closing one of said openings and a 

second planar heat exchange surface (23) disposed over and 
closing the other of said openings, the temperature of said 

first heat exchange surface (17) being different than the 
temperature of said second heat exchange surface (23) so as 

to provide a temperature gradient in said chamber (13). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein a block 
of cheese is disposed within said chamber (13), said cheese 

block having a uniform cross-section substantially 
equivalent to and smaller than the cross-section of said 

chamber (13) and a length less than the length of said 
chamber (13). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein the cross-section of said chamber (13) is from about 

16 to about 100 square inches (about 103.22 to about 
645.16cm²) and the cross-section of said cheese block is 

from about 1% to about 5% less than said chamber cross-section. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the length of said chamber (13) is from about 4 to 

about 10 inches (about 10.16 to about 25.4 cm) and the 
length
 of said cheese block is substantially equal to said 
chamber length.
