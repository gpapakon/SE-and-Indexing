<ABSTRACT>
Document form templates are grouped into groups of related form 
templates. The number of times a particular template is used by 

the system is counted for each group during a forms processing 
interval. Then when processing submitted forms, the method 

scans in a plurality of them in an aggregated submission. 
Forms recognition processing starts for a first form. The 

method begins searching for a form template to match the first 
form, starting with the most frequent group. If recognition of 

the first form is successful with the most frequent primary 
form template, then the method searches the group for the 

remaining submitted forms. If recognition of the first form is 
not successful with the most frequent group, then the method 

tries to match the first form with a template in the second 
most frequently processed primary group. In this manner, forms 

recognition of preprinted forms is managed, with the order of 
searching the template archive changed in response to the 

frequency with which particular form types are processed.

recognition, comprising the steps of: 

grouping all form templates into groups of related form 
templates; 

counting the number of times forms are received for each 
group during forms processing; 

arranging the order of search of template groups from most 
frequent to least frequent; 

scanning in a plurality of submitted forms in an 
aggregated submission; 

starting a forms recognition process for a first form in 
the submission; 

searching for a form template to match the first form, 

starting with the most frequent group;

form in the submission, in said most frequent group, if 
recognition of the first form is successful with said most 

frequent group; 
searching for a form template to match the next submitted 

form, starting with form templates in said most frequent 
group; 

continuing the forms recognition process for a remaining 
plurality of submitted forms in the aggregated submission,

with form templates in said most frequent group;

 
searching for a form template in other groups, if 

recognition of said next submitted form is not successful 
in said most frequent group; 

accessing a second most frequent group of related form 
templates, if recognition of the first form is not 

successful with said most frequent group; and

using said second most frequent group, if recognition of 
the first form is not successful with said most frequent 

group.
