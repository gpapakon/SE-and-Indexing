<ABSTRACT>
A turning plate (14) is mounted so as to be longitudinally displaceable on an elongate ground plate (12). The turning plate (14) comprises a central bolt (36) which can be moved from a locked position into an unlocked position, and vice versa. In the locked position, the bolt (36) engages in a hole (30) in the ground plate (12) and prevents the turning plate (14) from being displaced.

A rotary table for disabled persons, having a guide device 
on which a rotary plate (14) is mounted to be displaceable 

between two limit positions and rotatable in at least one of its 
two limit positions, having a locking pin (36, 36', 36'') which 

holds the rotary plate (14) firmly and non-displaceably in at 
least one of the shift limit positions, characterized in that the 

guide device is constructed as an elongate base plate (12) 
whereof the length, measured in the shift direction, is at least 

approximately twice as great as the diameter of the rotary plate 
(14) and which has a central longitudinal channel (22) in which 

there engages, rotatably and longitudinally displaceably, a shift 
plate (20) contoured in the shape of a circle and provided on the 

underside of the rotary plate (14), in that the rotary plate (14) 
and the shift plate (20) each have a downwardly open hole (32, 

34) arranged coaxially with respect to the axis of rotation, in 
that there is provided in the base wall of the longitudinal 

channel (22) a base hole (30) which, in one shift limit position 
of the rotary plate (14), is flush with the hole (32) therein and 

that in the shift plate (20), and in that the locking pin (36, 
36', 36'') is mounted to be axially displaceable in the holes (32, 

34) in the rotary plate (14) and the shift plate (20) and engages 
in the base hole (30) of the base plate (12) in the one shift 

limit position of the rotary plate (14). 
A rotary table according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the hole (32) in the rotary plate (14) is open at the top side 

thereof and the locking pin (36) has two latching positions in 
which it is selectively held by means of a spring arrangement 

(42), and in that the two end faces of the pin (36) form finger 
actuation surfaces. 
A rotary table according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the pin (36') is constantly pre-tensioned in the unlocked  

 
position towards the top side by an incorporated axially acting 

restoring spring (52), and in that the spring arrangement (42) 
is constructed such that the pin (36') comes into its unlocked 

position after passing its lower latching position in the 
downward direction and then being released by the restoring 

spring (52). 
A rotary table according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the pin is constantly pre-tensioned in the locked position 

by an incorporated axially acting spring (54) and, when the 
rotary plate (14) is displaced, slides along with its lower end 

face on the base wall of the longitudinal channel (20) and 
latches automatically into the base hole (30) of the base plate 

(12) in the limit position of the rotary plate (14). 
A rotary table according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
there is constructed in the base wall of the base plate (12) a 

sloping run-up ramp (58) which adjoins the base hole (30) and 
along which the pin (36'') is automatically raised into the 

unlocked position after overcoming an initial resistance on 
displacement of the rotary plate (14). 
A rotary table according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the base plate (12) has two mirror-symmetrical 

longitudinal halves.
