<ABSTRACT>
Tearing tool, in particular for the wallpapering trade, in particular for tearing open waterproof old wallpapers which are stuck to the wall, before removal thereof, characterised by a spiked roller (1) which is divided into two parts and is capable of rolling on the surface of the old wallpaper, the two part-rollers (2, 3) of which are axially forcibly displaced in opposite directions to one another during rolling.

A ripping tool, particularly for paper-hangers, 
for ripping open a layered material, more particularly 

for ripping old wallpaper stuck to a wall and before 
stripping, comprising a spiked roller mounted for 

rotation on a handle, wherein the spiked roller (1), 
passively rotated by rolling on the surface of the 

layered material (14), is divided into pairs of 
component rollers (2, 3), at least into two, 

characterised in that the component rollers (2, 3) in 
each pair of component rollers are mounted so as to be 

axially movable relatively to one another to a limited 
extent and are so positively guided that when the 

spiked roller rolls, the component rollers in each pair 
make axial movements reversing axially in opposite 

directions. 
A ripping tool according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the component rollers (2, 3) in at least one 

pair of component rollers are so mounted as to be non-rotatable 
(5) relatively to one another. 
A ripping tool according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that each component roller (2, 3) of 

the spiked roller (1) is mounted between two bearing 
blocks (6, 8; 8, 7) on a plain bearing shaft (4), and 

either the end faces of the component rollers (2, 3) 
have cam surfaces (23, 24; 25, 26) and the bearing 

blocks (6, 7, 8) have cams (27, 28, 29, 30) or 
conversely the end faces of the component rollers have 

cams and the bearing blocks have cam surfaces which, 
when the spiked roller (1) rolls, co-operate so as to  

 
control the positively-guided axial movement of the 

component rollers (2, 3). 
A ripping tool according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the cam guides on the two opposite end faces of 

at least one of the component rollers are so adapted to 
one another in dimensions in the axial direction that 

the component rollers are not axially movable without 
simultaneous rotation. 
A ripping tool according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that all component rollers (2, 3) are 

mounted on one and the same plain bearing shaft (4). 
A ripping tool according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that each pair of component rollers 

(2, 3) are connected together by a plain bearing 
journal (5) which is not rotationally symmetrical in 

cross-section and is in turn mounted on the plain 
bearing shaft (4) of the spiked roller (1). 
A ripping tool according to claim 6, characterised 
in that the bearing block (8) disposed between the two 

component rollers (2, 3) in a pair of component rollers 
supports the rotationally asymmetrical plain bearing 

pin (5) in freely rotatable manner. 
A ripping tool according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised by at least two wheels (11, 12) or 

rollers rotatable on the plain bearing shaft (4) or 
mounted so as to be pivotable thereon, disposed axially 

externally in front of the two end faces (9, 10) of the 
spiked roller (1) and rolling freely on a surface, the  

 
wheels or rollers being so dimensioned that the 

distance between the rolling surface and the plain 
bearing shaft of the spiked roller is less, at
 least 
substantially by the thickness (13) of the layer of 

material (14) for ripping open, than the distance of 
the rolling surface defined by the tips (15) of the 

spikes of the spiked roller. 
A ripping tool according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised by an at least substantially cylindrical 

protective casing (19, 20) to which the handle (22) is 
secured and which surrounds the spiked roller (1) and 

all the associated functional parts and which uncovers 
the spiked roller so that it can roll, by pivoting a 

protective covering (20) which is part of the 
protective casing.
