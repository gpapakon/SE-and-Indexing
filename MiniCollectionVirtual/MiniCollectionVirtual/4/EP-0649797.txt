Soft-carton pack for cigarettes, having a carton-like
container (10) which is formed from a blank (17, 21,

22) made of foldable packaging material and is intended
for receiving a cigarette group (31), which projects out

of the container (10), which is open at the top, the
carton-like container (10) having a front wall (15), a

rear wall (16), side walls (18, 19) and a base wall (20),
which is formed from a border strip of the blank, and

also having at least one local material reinforcement,

characterized in that

a) a material reinforcement extends at least over the
entire region of the base wall (20),
b) for the purpose of forming the material reinforcement,
the entire base wall (20) has at least two layers

of the blank (17, 21, 22),
c) the entire border strip (29, 30) which is used for
forming the base wall (20) is formed from at least two

layers of the blank (17, 21, 22).
Soft-carton pack according to Claim 1, characterized
in that, by virtue of the packaging material

being folded over in the region of the border strip (29),
folding tabs of the base wall (20), namely longitudinal

tabs (23, 24) and corner tabs (25, 26), have two layers
of the blank.
Soft-carton pack according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the material reinforcement extends

into the region of the front wall (15), of the rear wall
(16) and of the side walls (18, 19) of the carton-like

container (10), and in that the multi-layered border
strip (30), which is formed by virtue of being folded 

over, is of a width which is greater than the width of
the folding tabs of the base wall (20).
Soft-carton pack according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the layers of the material reinforcement,

which are formed by virtue of the packaging
material being folded over, are connected to one another

by adhesive bonding over the entire surface area or by
sealing over the entire surface area.
Soft-carton pack according to Claim 3,
characterized in that in a region above the base wall

(20), namely on a top border region which is directed
towards an end wall (14), the carton-like container (10)

has a further material reinforcement, and in that, by
virtue of Z-shaped folding (34) of the packaging

material, the further material reinforcement has a
plurality of layers of the blank (17).
Soft-carton pack according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the end wall (14) is designed

integrally, such that folding tabs (37, 38) of the end
wall (14) are connected integrally to an inner folding

layer (36) of the Z-fold (34).
