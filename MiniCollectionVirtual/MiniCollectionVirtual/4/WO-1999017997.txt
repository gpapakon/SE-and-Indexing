<ABSTRACT>
A collapsible box, made from a blank of impermeable material, includes a bottom (F), head panels (T1, T2) and reinforcing tabs (X1, X2) of the head panels, with longitudinal folding lines lying in a box longitudinal symmetry plane. Straight and inclined folding lines extend from the symmetry plane and across the head panels. The folding lines allow the bottom (F), the head panels and tabs to fold inwards in the box until the box is collapsed.

<DESCRIPTION>
COLLAPSIBLE BOX AND A BLANK FOR MAKING SAID BOXFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a collapsible box and to a blank for making the collapsible box.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTIt is known that boxes are used for containing various articles, such as food stuff, e.g. fish, fruit, and/or vegetables .Known boxes are not liquid tight at bottom and also the sides and heads are not liquid tight in the regions close to the bottom.This fact is very disadvantageous in case the boxes are filled with wet articles or articles producing liquids.In fact, liquid substances can leak onto other boxes, situated below, on the articles contained therein, which, obviously is not acceptable, mainly because of hygienic requirements . Moreover, it is needed to reduce the boxes during the transport, storage and disposal.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe object of the present invention is to propose a box made from impermeable material, which is considerably reduced when not used, and that is simple and easy to produce .Another object of the invention is to propose a box, which is collapsed to the minimum non-use configuration 

and opened to the use configuration without additional means and without the need of specialised operator.Yet further object of the present invention is to propose a box, which avoids leaking at the bottom and in the regions of the side panels and head panels adjacent to the bottom.Still a further object of the present invention is to propose a box, which obtains all the previous objects and is also very strong. The above mentioned objects are obtained in accordance with the contents of the claims, by means of a collapsible box including a rectangular bottom, longitudinal side panels hinged to said bottom by means of longitudinal creasing lines and first and second head panels articulated to the edges of the bottom along transversal creasing lines, with flaps journaled to said head panels along further creasing lines forming vertical edges of the head panels, said flaps being joined to adjacent portions of outer longitudinal surfaces of said side panels, said box further including: a first folding line extending along the longitudinal axis of said bottom thus defining two longitudinal flaps, that can rotate about said first folding line and towards the inside of the box; second and third straight folding lines extending from the extremities of the first folding line across the corresponding heads and lying in a vertical plane of symmetry of the box, thus defining in each head two semi- heads

2
