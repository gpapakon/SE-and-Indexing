<ABSTRACT>
A two-stage fuel delivery system (10) for a two-stroke 
internal combustion engine that includes a first stage pump (12) 

having a first pump chamber (16) with an inlet (20) coupled to a 
fuel source (21), an outlet (22) and a diaphragm (14) responsive to 

pressure pulsations from the engine crankcase for reciprocation 
within the chamber. A second stage pump (24) includes a second pump 

chamber (28) having an inlet (30) coupled to the outlet of the first 
chamber, an outlet (32) for delivering fuel under pressure to engine 

fuel injectors (34) or the like, a permanent magnet (46) for mounting 
on the flywheel (48) of the engine for rotation in synchronism with 

operation of the engine, and a diaphragm (36) in the second chamber 
operatively coupled to the magnet for reciprocation with the second 

chamber responsive to rotation of the magnet to pump fuel from the 
inlet to the outlet of the second chamber. The two-stage pump 

achieves fuel delivery pressures on the order of 25 to 30 psi or 
more employing energy from reciprocation of the engine and without 

requiring control electronics or electrical energy input.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to fuel delivery systems 
for internal combustion engines, and more particularly to a two-stage 
fuel pump system for increasing fuel delivery pressure. In fuel delivery systems for internal combustion engines, 
particularly two-stroke engines, it has heretofore been proposed to 
provide a diaphragm pump responsive to pressure pulsations from the 
engine crankcase for feeding fuel from a supply or tank to engine 
fuel injectors or the like. Fuel pressures obtainable with systems 
of this type are typically on the order of 10 to 11 psi. A general 
object of the present invention is to provide a fuel delivery system 
that is adapted to achieve fuel delivery pressures on the order of 25 
to 30 psi or more, that obtains pumping energy from reciprocation of 
the engine without electronic control circuitry or energy input, 
that is economical to manufacture, and that provides reliable 
operation over an extended lifetime. A fuel pump in accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention comprises a chamber having an inlet for coupling to a fuel 
source and an outlet for delivering fuel under pressure to engine 
fuel injectors or the like. A pump mechanism is disposed in the 
chamber and coupled to first magnetic material for reciprocating the 
mechanism within the chamber, and thereby pumping fuel from the inlet 
to the outlet. Second magnetic material is mounted for motion 
adjacent to the first magnetic material in synchronism with operation  
 
of the engine, such that magnetic forces imparted in the first 
magnetic material as the second magnetic material moves therepast 
reciprocates the pump mechanism within the chamber. In the preferred 
embodiment of the invention, the pump mechanism comprises a diaphragm 
that spans the pumping chamber, and the first magnetic material 
comprises a piston coupled to the diaphragm by a rod. The second 
magnetic material comprises a permanent magnet mounted on the 
periphery of the flywheel of the engine for rotation past the magnetic 
piston to reciprocate the diaphragm within the chamber. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, 
a two-stage fuel delivery system for an internal combustion engine 
includes a first stage pump having a first pump chamber with an inlet 
coupled to a fuel source, an outlet and a diaphragm responsive to 
pressure pulsations from the engine crankcase for reciprocation 
within the chamber. A second stage pump includes a second pump 
chamber having an inlet coupled to the outlet of the

<CLAIMS>
A two-stage fuel delivery system (10) for a two-stroke 
internal combustion engine that comprises: 

   a first stage pump (12) that includes a first pump chamber 
(16) having an inlet (20) coupled to a fuel source (21), an outlet 

(22), and means (14) responsive to pressure pulsations from a crankcase 
(18) of the engine for reciprocation in said chamber to pump fule 

from said inlet to said outlet, and 
   a second stage pump (24) that includes a second pump chamber 

(28) having an inlet (30) coupled to said outlet of said first 
chamber, an outlet (32) for delivering fuel under pressure, a permanent 

magnet (46) for mounting on a flywheel (48) of the engine for rotation 
in synchronism with operation of the engine, and means (36 through 

40) disposed in said second chamber adjanet to the engine flywheel 
and operatively coupled to said magnet for reciprocation in said 

second chamber responsive to said magnet to pump fuel from said inlet 
to said outlet of said second chamber. 
The two-stage fuel delivery system (10) set forth in claim 
1 wherein said means disposed in said second chamber comprise a 

flexible diaphragm (36) and magnetically permeable means (40) mounted 
to said diaphragm for reciprocal actuation by said permanent magnet 

(46) mounted on the flywheel (48). 
The system set forth in claim 1 or 2 further comprising 
check valves at said inlet (30) and outlet (32) to prevent reverse 

flow of fuel through said chamber.
