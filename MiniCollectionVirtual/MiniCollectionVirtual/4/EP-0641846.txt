<ABSTRACT>
Low-odour (meth)acrylate formulations which cure by means of free-radical polymerisation and their use for the bonding, sealing, casting (encapsulating, grouting) and coating of substrates. To achieve good low-temperature flexibility of the adhesive film and substantially temperature-independent results when processing in the range from 0 to 40 DEG C, it is proposed for the formulation to comprise at least two polymers which are dissolved in a monomer mixture which constitutes a solvent for the polymers, for the in each case at least two polymers to be selected either from the group of the sulphochlorinated polyethylenes or from the group of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers and for the polymers selected from the respective group to be similar to one another, the proportion of each selected polymer making up at least 10 % of the overall quantity of polymer to be dissolved in the solvent, and for the monomer mixture to comprise, for each 100 parts by mass of the formulation, from 10 to 70 parts of one or more ester (meth)acrylates and from 1 to 20 parts of acid monomers. The formulations may additionally comprise initiator systems, modifiers and auxiliaries.
