<ABSTRACT>
Process for the treatment of solid products containing a metal of low melting point, according to which these products are heated in a first zone, are thermolysed (2) in a second zone at a subatmospheric pressure while liquid metal flowing from the products is collected with the aid of a siphon (7) communicating with the outside, and then these products are reduced in a third zone, these zones being isolated from one another and from the outside by doors forming lock chambers.
