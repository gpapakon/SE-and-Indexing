<ABSTRACT>
A novel triphenylamine derivative is useful as 
a charge-transporting material having high carrier mobility 

and has the formula (1): 

wherein R¹, R², R³, R⁴, and R⁵ is each hydrogen, lower 
alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, or substituted or unsubstituted 

aryl; or R¹ and R² and/or R³ and R⁴ may be taken together 
to form a ring; and n represents 0 or 1. 
The derivative (I) may be used to form an electrophotographic 
photoreceptor by coating it onto a conductive 

support, optionally with a binder, to form a charge-transporting 
layer. 
A charge-generating material, e.g. 
a phthalocyanine or azo pigment, is coated as a separate 

layer or included in the same layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
triphenylamine derivative represented by the following
general formula (1):

wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 may be the same or different and each
represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon
atoms, an alkoxy group, a halogen atom or an aryl group which may
be substituted with an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group or a halogen atom, or wherein R1 and R2 and/or R3
and R4 may be taken together to form a 5- to 7-membered ring, and
n represents 0 or 1. This invention further relates to a charge-transporting material
comprising the derivative and to an electrophotographic
photoreceptor containing a charge-transporting layer
comprising the charge-transporting material. Inorganic photoconductive materials recently in use
include amorphous silicon, amorphous selenium, cadmium
sulfide, zinc oxide, and the like. However, some of these
materials are expensive because of difficulties in production
thereof, while others are toxic and disadvantageous from the
standpoint of environmental protection.On the other hand, as organic photoconductors,
ones of the type comprising, in particular, a charge-generating
material and a charge-transporting material which
perform their respective functions have been extensively
proposed (e.g., U.S. Patent 3,791,826). In this type, there
is the possibility that a high-sensitivity electrophotographic
photoreceptor can be obtained by using a substance
which efficiently generates carriers (the term "carriers"
means "charges" in this specification) as the charge-generating
material, in combination with a substance having
high carrier-transporting ability as the charge-transporting
material.Of these materials, the charge-transporting material
is required to efficiently receive the carriers generated in
the charge-generating material upon illumination in an
electric field and permit them to rapidly move through the
photosensitive layer to extinguish the surface charges
promptly. The speed at which carriers move per unit electric
field is called carrier mobility. A high carrier mobility 
means that carriers rapidly move in the charge-transporting
layer. Any charge-transporting substance has has its intrinsic
carrier mobility and, hence, it is necessary that for
attaining a high carrier mobility, a material having a high
carrier mobility be employed. However, the attainable
carrier mobilities have not yet reached a sufficient level.Further, in the case of applying a charge-transporting
substance after dissolving
