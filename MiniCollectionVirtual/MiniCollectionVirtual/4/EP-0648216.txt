<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns adducts of O,O-dialkyldithiophosphoric acids, in which the alkyl groups have 4 to 18 carbon atoms, with long-chain unsaturated monohydric alcohols or with addition products of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide with such alcohols. These adducts are suitable for use as metal-free, hydrolysis-stable anti-wear additives for lubricants.
