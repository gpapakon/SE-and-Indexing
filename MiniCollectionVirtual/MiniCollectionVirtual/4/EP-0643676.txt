<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the purification of
discharged water from industrial plants, and more
specifically a combination of a specific biological and a
general chemical purification process. The Authorities and
the community are demanding increasingly stricter standards
for the discharge of waste water into the environment. In
the following the invention will be explained with reference
to discharged water from the dairy industry, but it may be
used with every relevant purification process, where
substances are to be converted to environmently friendly
compounds.There are today two main processes for the purification of
discharged water based on biological and chemical
techniques. The principle applied in biological purification
is that living micro-organisms are used to metabolize
pollutants into harmless compounds and gases.One of the principles with chemical purification of
discharged water from the food industry is that by lowering
the pH almost to the isoelectric point of proteins, these
are precipitated. With the addition of a flocculant and
dispersed air the precipitated proteins will float together
with fat which due to the density will float to the surface
in a water solution. Sugar and other soluble components are
not cleansed through this chemical method.Chemical purification of discharged water from the food
industry is in use or has been in use at several
enterprises. Most plants use mineral acid together with a
flocculant such as ferric chloride or CMC (carboxyl-methyl
cellulose) to adjust pH and as a precipitant for protein
which is removed together with fat through flotation or
through the addition of dispersed air. If one should want to
recover the protein in the chemical sludge for use in animal 
feed, other types of precipitants should preferably be used.
There exists a batch-type plant where CMC is used as
flocculant together with mineral acid, e.g. sulphuric acid
and where the sludge is separated through flotation. Figure
1 is an example of such a plant.The discharged water contains proteins, sugar and fat. It is
desirable to obtain a better purification result by also
purifying the soluble sugar from the water phase.The procedure for purification of discharged water in
process tanks where a flocculant and dispersed air are
used is characterized in that biocatalyst particles with
immobilizing micro-organisms or enzymes for conversion of
waste products are added to the discharged water. The
procedure is further characterized in that sugar, proteins
or fat are converted

<CLAIMS>
A method for the purification of discharged water in process tanks where a
flocculant and dispersed air in water are used and said water contains proteins and/or fats and

sugar, 
characterized
 in that biocatalyst particles with immobilized micro-organisms or
enzymes are added, said micro-organisms or enzymes being functional to convert the sugar

into acid, and thereby lowering the pH whereupon the proteins and/or fats are precipitated by
means of said flocculant and dispersed air.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that sugar, proteins or fat is
converted into acid, which precipitates the remaining proteins isoelectrically in a combined

biological and chemical purification step.
A method according to claims 1-2, 
characterized
 in that proteins and fat are
recovered by means of floatation through the addition of a flocculant and dispersed air.
A method according to claims 1-3, 
characterized
 in that immobilized gasifying
micro-organisms are added.
A method according to claims 1-4, 
characterized
 in that flotation is performed in
such way, as to result in a process concentrate, which e.g. may be used as animal feed.
A method according to claim 5, 
characterized
 in that biocatalyst particles
become part of the process concentrate.
A method according to claims 1-6, 
characterized
 in that the temperature in the
process water is kept between 10 and 50 Â°C.
