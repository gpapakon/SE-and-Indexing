<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a convergent-divergent 
nozzle of variable geometry capable of orienting the flow of 
gas, for a gas turbine propulsor, used as means of propulsion 
in aviation. More specifically, in a preferred application, the 
nozzle to which the present invention relates is of the 
axisymmetric type, comprising a convergent zone followed, in 
the direction of flow, by a divergent zone, both formed by 
master petals, distributed circumferentially around the 
longitudinal axis of the propulsor and connected to each 
other by articulations, and by slave petals, also connected 
together by articulations and distributed circumferentially 
around the longitudinal axis of the propulsor, the convergent 
zone of which defines an A8 throat of variable area and the 
divergent zone of which, also of variable geometry, may be 
actuated so as to orient the flow of gas, and therefore the 
thrust, in any direction on a cone directed around the 
longitudinal axis of the propulsor. The maneuverability of airplanes is an essential factor. 
This maneuverability, which has been obtained up to now by 
aerodynamic forces, can be substantially improved by changing  
 
the orientation of the flow from its normal axial direction 
of actuation. The orienting of the flow of gas has been used for many 
years in rocket motors. In them, the systems are much 
simpler, since the nozzles are of constant geometry. Convergent-divergent nozzles of variable geometry are of 
relatively recent introduction in supersonic planes driven by 
turbojet or turboprop propulsors. In this class of nozzle, the systems for the orienting 
of the flow are not yet in operational stage, being in the 
experimentation or development phase. The ones which are in 
the most advanced state are those of the two-dimensional type 
in which the flow is oriented only in one plane. It is of particular advantage to effect the orientation 
of the flow in nozzles with axial symmetry since the 
direction of the flow can then be varied in any axial plane, 
the pitch and yaw planes being particularly important. There are various patents covering mechanisms for 
orienting the flow in this type of nozzle, since 
theoretically it is possible to effect this in different 
ways, although it is very difficult to see to it that they 
are not of a high degree of complication. To orient only the divergent zone of the nozzle 
downstream of the A8 throat area has the advantage that the 
disturbances induced by the orientation are not transmitted 
upstream of the

An orientable axisymmetric nozzle of variable geometry

section (2) followed, in the direction of flow, by a 
divergent section (3), both formed by master petals (4, 

5) connected together by articulations and by slave 
petals (33, 34), also connected together by 

articulations, both of them being distributed 
circumferentially around the longitudinal axis (14) of 

the propulsor; the convergent section (2) defining an A8 
variable area throat (12) and the divergent section (3) 

being of variable geometry in order to orient the flow 
in any direction on a cone located around the 

longitudinal axis (14) of the propulsor, including 
control means for regulating the A8 throat area (12) and 

control means for orienting the flow, by the axial 
displacement and the inclination of an outer annular 

part (6) in any direction, with center of rotation on a 
point of the longitudinal axis (14) of the propulsor 

respectively, each divergent master petal (5) being 
connected to the outer annular part (6) by a 

biarticulated bar (15), connected directly by one 
of its ends to the outer annular part (6) by a 

cylindrical articulation (16) which, when there is no 
orientation of the flow, is tangent to a theoretical 

circumference concentric to the longitudinal axis (14) 
of the propulsor and located in a theoretical plane 

perpendicular to said longitudinal axis (14) of the  
 

propulsor, characterized by the fact that 
the biarticulated bar (15) while by the opposite end it is connected via 

two intermediate bars (26, 27) to the divergent master 
petal; which intermediate bars (26, 27) are connected by 

one of their ends to the divergent master petal (5) at 
longitudinally aligned points of said petal by spherical 

articulations (29, 31) and are connected together by a 
spherical articulation (30), the intermediate bar (26) 

which is upstream being furthermore connected to the 
biarticulated bar (15) by a cylindrical articulation (32) 

with axis (17) which, when there is no orientation of 
the flow, is tangent to a theoretical circumference

master petal is formed by a single section and connected 

by its upstream end to the corresponding convergent 
master petal (4) by means of a spherical articulation,

fact that the spherical articulation (30) which connects 

the intermediate bar (27) located downstream with the 
intermediate bar (26) located upstream is located on the

connects the biarticulated bar (15) with the 

intermediate bar (26) located upstream. 
A nozzle according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized by the 
fact that the connection between the downstream
