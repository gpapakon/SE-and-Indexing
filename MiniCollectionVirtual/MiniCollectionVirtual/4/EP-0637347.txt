<DESCRIPTION>
 DEINKING CHEMICALS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention:This invention relates to a process for regenerating wastepaper, and more specifically to the use of deinking chemicals prepared by reaction of epoxidized derivatives of C10-C22 carboxylic acids with an alkoxylated polyhydroxy alcohol for the regeneration of wastepaper.Today, wastepaper is used in large quantities for the production of, for example, newsprint and hygiene paper. Brightness and color are important quality features for papers of this type. To achieve this, the printing inks have to be removed from the printed wastepaper. This is normally done by deinking processes essentially comprising two steps, namely:1. refining the wastepaper, i.e., fiberizing in water in the presence of the chemicals required for detachment of the printing ink particles, and2. removal of the detached printing ink particles from the fiber suspension.The second step can be carried out by washing or flotation (Ullmanns Encyclopaedie der technischen Chemie, 

4th Edition. Vol. 17, pages 570-571 (1979)). In flotation, which utilizes the difference in wetability between printing inks and paper fibers, air is forced or drawn through the fiber suspension. Small air bubbles attach themselves to the printing ink particles and form a froth at the surface of the water which is removed.The deinking of wastepaper is normally carried out at alkaline pH values in the presence of alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal silicates, oxidative bleaches and surfactants at temperatures in the range from 30 to 50°C. Anionic and/or nonionic surfactants, for example soaps, ethoxylated fatty alcohols and/or ethoxylated alkyl phenols are mainly used as surfactants (Wochenblatt fuer Papierfabrikation 17, 646 to 649 (1985) ) Discussion of Related Art:DE-OS 31 01444 relates to a process for the deinking of wastepaper using a compound corresponding to the following general formulaRCOO - CCH2CH20)m - CA0)n - R1 in which R is a C7.21 alkyl or alkenyl group, R1 is a hydrogen atom or a c_,.18 alkyl, alkenyl or acyl group, AO represents CmE60 and C4H80 groups or a mixture of C2H40, C-.H60 and C4H80 groups, m is an integer of 1 to 100 and n is an integer of 1 to 100. The use of ethoxylated castor oils for the deinking of printed wastepaper is known, for example, from JP 78/52705, reported in Chem. Abstr. 89., 131445J (1978) , and from DE 21 48 590. The Japanese patent describes mixtures of castor 

oil with 10 to 400% ethylene oxide and ethoxylated nonylphenol which are suitable for the
