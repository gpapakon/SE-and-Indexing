<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a feedwater supply arrangement in a steam generator, preferably in a waste-heat boiler of a combined cycle power plant having at least one waste-heat boiler which is equipped with a high-pressure system and with a low-pressure system which in each case can be supplied from at least one feedwater vessel (container) (10) and whose feedwater pump lines (trains of pipes) (26 to 31) are respectively designed with three-fold redundancy. Said feedwater pump lines (26 to 31) have pumps (32, 33) with an electric drive motor (35). In each case, one pump (32) for the low-pressure system and one pump (33) for the high-pressure system have a common drive motor (35).

Circuit arrangement for introducing the feed 
water into a steam generator of a combined-cycle power 

station having a two-pressure waste-heat boiler, which 
is equipped with a high-pressure and a low-pressure 

system, the circuit arrangement having at least one 
feed-water container (10) and a feed-water pump 

section, with which the high-pressure and the low-pressure 
system can be fed, which feed-water pump 

section is formed by three redundant feed-water pump 
lines (26-31) which each have a low-pressure pump (33) 

with an associated electric motor as the drive and a 
high-pressure pump (32) with an electric motor as the 

drive, the low-pressure pump and the high-pressure pump 
of each feed-water pump line in each case having a 

common medium-voltage motor (35) as the drive. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a single feed-water container (10) is provided, 

to which feed-water conduits (20, 22, 24) are 
connected, which conduits are connected in series with 

the feed-water pump lines (26 to 31). 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that each feed-water conduit (20, 22, 24) has a 

filter station (21, 23, 25) connected upstream of the 
feed-water pump lines (26 to 31). 
Arrangement according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that each of the feed-water conduits (20, 22, 24) is 

divided into a low-pressure pump line (26, 28, 30) and 
a high-pressure pump line (27, 29, 31) after the filter 

station (21, 23, 25), viewed in the flow direction. 
Arrangement according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that each low-pressure pump line (26, 28, 30) is 

connected to a low-pressure collecting conduit (36) and 
each high-pressure pump line (27, 29, 31) is connected 

to a high-pressure collecting conduit (37), which are 
respectively led to at least one waste-heat boiler.
