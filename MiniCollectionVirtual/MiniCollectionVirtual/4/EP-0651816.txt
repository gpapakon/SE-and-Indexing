<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating a patient having a panic disorder, the patient having an elevated CCK peptide plasma level, by lowering the plasma CCK peptide level of the patient. A further method provides a diagnosis of panic disorder in a patient by detecting if that patient's plasma contains elevated CCK peptide levels. A further method determines the efficacy of the drug for the treatment of panic disorder by detecting the ability of the drug to lower elevated CCK peptide levels in a model for panic disorder. Additionally, a method of dosing a patient having elevated CCK peptide levels with an antipanic disorder drug is characterized by administering the drug to a patient and monitoring the lowering of the elevated plasma CCK peptide levels of the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BLOOD LEVELS OF CCK PEPTIDES RELATIVE TO PANIC DISORDER TREATMENTTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to the relationship between cholecystokinin (CCK) and panic disorder. More specifically, the present invention provides 1) a method of treating a patient having a panic disorder, 2) a method of diagnosing panic disorder in a patient, 3) a method of determining the efficacy of a drug for the treatment of panic disorder, and 4) a method of predicting the vulnerability of a patient to panic disorder.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the relationship between panic disorder and cholecystokinin (CCK) . Panic disorder affects 3.6% of the general population(1) and 10-14% of patients in cardiology practices (2,3). It is a chronic relapsing illness(4,5) characterized by paroxysmal anxiety attacks that strike suddenly and for no apparent reason. Seventy-five percent of its victims are women(6) . It has a unimodal age of onset (mean 23 years) rarely starting before age 12 or after age 45(7) and is 12 times 

more frequent in the 25-44 age group than in the 65+ age group(6) . Panic disorder is more common in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins(8) . Its inheritance pattern is consistent with single locus genetics (9,10,11) and preliminary evidence implicates the long arm of chromosome 16(12). It is associated with an increased risk of mitral valve prolapse(13) , hypertension(14) , alcohol abuse and dependence(15) , and has an excess mortality from suicide and among men from cardiovascular death(16) . The lack of understanding of the biochemical basis of panic disorder is hampering the development of drugs effective in the treatment of this disorder. Recently Bradwejn, et al. (17) reported that intravenous administration of 25-50 micrograms of CCK-4 precipitated panic attacks at a greater rate in panic disorder victims than normal controls. Bradwejn and de Montigny(18) previously reported that CCK induced activation of hippocampal neurones can be antagonized by benzodiazepines. Since some CCK antagonists have a benzodiazepine structure(19) and panic disorder responds well to high potency benzodiazepines(20,21,22) , their action on CCK might be the cause of their therapeutic effect. 

 Cholecystokinin (CCK) , previously called pancreozy in, is a major gastrointestinal hormone(23) . It is also one of the most common neuropeptides in the brain(24,25) . CCK peptides exist in several molecular forms, the most abundant being the sulphated octapeptide CCK-8S (26) . CCK containing neurones

CLAIMS
What is Claimed is:
1. A method of treating a patient having a panic attack, the patient having an elevated CCK peptide plasma level, characterized by lowering the plasma CCK peptide level of the patient.
2. A method of claim 1 further including the steps of administering a therapeutic dose of a drug that lowers the elevated plasma CCK peptide level of the patient.
3. A method of claim 2 wherein the drug is a benzodiazepine. 4. A method of claim 2 wherein the drug is a CCK peptide antagonist.
5. A method of claim 2 wherein the drug inhibits CCK peptide synthesis.
6. A method of claim 2 wherein the drug lowers CCK-4 and CCK-8S levels.
7. A method of claim 2 wherein the drug lowers CCK-4 levels.
8. A method of claim 2 wherein the drug is Alprazolam. 9. A method of claim 2 wherein the drug is Buspirone. 


 10. A method of diagnosing panic disorder in a patient by obtaining a plasma sample from the patient and detecting that the patient's plasma contains elevated CCK peptide levels.
11. A method of claim 10 further characterized by detecting elevated CCK-4 levels.
12. A method of claim 11 further characterized by detecting levels of CCK-4 greater than 11 p mol/Â£.
13. A method of claim 10 further characterized by detecting elevated CCK-8S levels.
14. A method of claim 13 further characterized by detecting levels of CCK-8S greater than that of age and sex-matched normal subjects.
15. A method of claim 10 further including the steps of overnight fasting the patient, obtaining a baseline pretreatment blood sample, stimulating CCK peptide production in the patient, periodically collecting blood samples from the patient, obtaining patient plasma from the samples and determining CCK peptide levels. 16. A method of claim 15 wherein said stimulating step is further defined as feeding the patient a meal of about 600 calories. 



 17. A method of claim 15 wherein said detecting step is further defined as determining CCK peptide levels by high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. 18. A method of determining the efficiency a drug for the treatment of panic disorders by detecting the ability of a drug to lower elevated CCK peptide levels in a model for panic disorders. 19. A method of claim 18 being further characterized as detecting the ability of the drug to antagonize CCK peptide activity.
20. A method of claim 18 further characterized by detecting the ability of the drug to block CCK peptide synthesis.
21. A method of predicting the vulnerability of a patient to panic disorder by obtaining a plasma sample from the patient and detecting that the patient's plasma attains elevated CCK peptide levels greater than that of age and sex-matched normal subjects.
22. A method of dosing a patient having elevated CCK peptide plasma levels with an antipanic disorder drug by administering the drug to a patient and monitoring the lowering of the elevated plasma CCK peptide levels of the patient.
