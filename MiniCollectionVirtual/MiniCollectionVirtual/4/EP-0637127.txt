<ABSTRACT>
A three-phase electronic inverter for an electric 
induction motor can operate the latter silently without the 

generation of magnetorestriction noise where the voltage of the 
rectifier outputted to the power transistor bridge is controlled 

by a 
TRIAC
 with regulation of the angle of conduction while the 
power transistor are pulsed in response to the output of a 

microprocessor through level adapters constituted by operational 
amplifiers.

<DESCRIPTION>
My present invention relates to a three-phase 
electronic inverter for variable speed operation of an electric 
motor and to a method of operating same. An electronic inverter basically comprises a switch 
circuit which is interposed between an alternating current 
network and an alternating current load and outputs a variable 
frequency alternating current to enable an electric motor, for 
example, to be driven at various speeds asynchronous induction 
motors must be energized with varying frequency or a controlled 
frequency which establishes the speed thereof. For this purpose electronic inserters can be provided 
to transform the constant-frequency network supply, usually at 50 
Hz or 60 Hz to direct current and the resulting direct current to 
an alternating current by the triggering of power transistors. In commercially available inverters on the market for 
the actuation of electric induction motors with variable 
frequency, the half-wave rectified signal constituting the 
output voltage to the power transistor bridge is modulated by a  
 
chopping technique, so-called "pulse width modulation". This has 
the drawback of producing noise in the motor. The noise is due 
to a magnetorestrictive phenomenon in the motor resulting from 
the relatively high pilot frequency of the chopper. The device 
does provide for varying the output voltage of the inverter 
circuit with variation of the frequency as is required. Another method used to provide a frequency/voltage 
correlation is to use an inverter delivering a frequency which 
depends linearly on the supply voltage. If the voltage is 
doubled in such a circuit, the frequency is doubled. Such inverters have relatively complex circuitry and 
often have problems in maintaining a constant voltage with 
increasing loads on the motor. It is, therefore, the principal object of the present 
invention to provide an improved three-phase electronic inverter 
for driving with variable speed a three-phase electronic 
induction motor whereby drawbacks of earlier systems can be 
avoided and, in particular, the noise generated by the electric 
motor in the inverter can be reduced and a practically silent 
operation obtained. Another object of this invention is to provide an 
electronic inverter which avoids the need for a chopper affecting 
the inverter output of the type described and, in addition, which 
eliminates the need for complex inverter circuitry which might  
 
create problems with maintaining a constant voltage for varying 
loads. These objects and others
