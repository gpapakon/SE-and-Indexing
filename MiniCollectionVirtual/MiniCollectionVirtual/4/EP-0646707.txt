<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injector (10) for a combustor of a gas turbine engine 
comprises an injector housing (100) having fuel discharge passage (120) 

for receiving pressurized fuel and communicated to the combustor for 
discharging the fuel thereto and an air discharge passage (130) for 

receiving pressurized air and communicated to the combustor for 
discharging the air thereto to atomize the discharged fuel. A purge 

passage (150) in the housing is communicated to the fuel discharge 
passage at one end and communicated to the air discharge passage at 

another end. The end of the purge passage is communicated to the air 
discharge passage by opening directly to the air discharge passage or, 

alternately, indirectly via a duct member (200) on the injector housing 
extending from a region proximate the end of the purge passage to the 

air passage. A valve (160) in the housing is operable during fuel flow 
to the fuel injector for blocking communication between the purge 

passage and the fuel discharge passage while the purge passage and air 
discharge passage are communicated and, operable upon interruption of 

fuel flow to communicate the purge passage and fuel discharge passage to 
provide purge air from the air discharge passage through the purge 

passage to purge fuel residing in the fuel passage to the combustor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a selfpurging
fuel injector for a combustor of a gas turbine
engine.Efforts to reduce emissions and improve
combustor performance in gas turbine engines have
brought about the use of staged fuel systems wherein
one or more fuel injectors are used for low speed (low
power) engine operation and one or more other fuel
injectors are used for higher speed (higher power)
engine operation. The fuel injectors used for low
speed engine operation are commonly referred to as
pilot or primary fuel injectors for providing a
continuous fuel flow to the engine combustor for all
regimes of engine operation from idle to high speed
operation. The fuel injectors used for higher speed
engine operation are referred to as secondary or main
injectors for providing supplemental fuel flow to the
engine combustor in an on-demand manner when higher
engine speed (power) is required. The secondary fuel 
injectors thus are rendered non-operative during idle
operation of the engine when the supplemental fuel
flow is not needed and are rendered operative during
higher speed (power) engine operation when
supplemental fuel flow is required.Airblast fuel injectors have been used in
non-staged gas turbine engine fuel systems and are
described in the Helmrich U.S. Patent 3,684,186 issued
August 16, 1972 and the Simmons U.S. Patent 3,980,233
issued Sept. 14, 1976. Airblast fuel injectors are
designed to achieve atomization of a film of liquid
fuel formed on a fuel discharge orifice surface or lip
by directing high velocity airflow supplied from the
engine compressor to an air passage of the injector at
the fuel film as it leaves the fuel discharge orifice
surface.Airblast fuel injectors have been proposed
for use in a staged gas turbine engine fuel system.
However, use of airblast fuel injectors in a staged
fuel system may present a so-called coking problem
when the airblast fuel injectors comprise the 
secondary (or main) injectors of the system that are
rendered non-operative during some engine operational
regimes (e.g., low power regime such as low speed idle
operation) and operative during other engine
operational regimes (e.g., high speed operation). In
particular, when the secondary (or main) fuel
injectors are rendered non-operative during low power
engine operation, fuel remains in the fuel discharge
passages of the injectors and can be heated by the
elevated temperature of the combustor environment to
the extent that the fuel in the fuel discharge
passages is carbonized (coked) over time, building
