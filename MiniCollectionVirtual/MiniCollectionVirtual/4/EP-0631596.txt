 POLYMER FORMED BY REACTION OF A POLYKETONE AND AN AMINO ACIDBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONVarious disclosures exist in the prior art regarding t formation of nitrogen-containing polymers by the reaction o a poiyketone with an amino reagent. Included among such documents are U.S. Patent Nos. 3,979,374, 5,047,501, and 5,081,207, J. of the Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. , 1989, pp. 965-967, and Macromolecules, 1989, 22, 2012-2014. In all o the foregoing references the reagent which is reacted with the poiyketone is, in most cases, a primary amine, e.g., an alkyl amine, benzyl amine, or a substituted benzyl amine, a amino pyridine or an amino alkylpyridine. The Macromolecul publication suggests the use of primary amines with dialkylamino, hydroxy, and vinyl groups.SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTIONThe present invention relates to polymers formed by reaction of the aforementioned type of polyketones with an amino acid or derivative thereof. This particular type of polymer is novel since it contains, on the pyrrole ring in such a nitrogen-containing polymer, either carboxy functionality or a functionality convertible thereto which not found in the polymers known to the persons of ordinary skill in the art.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTIONThe present invention relies upon use of a "poiyketone as one of the reagents in forming the polymers claimed belo As is well known to persons of ordinary skill in the art, poiyketone materials are formed by the polymerization of 

carbon monoxide and at least one olefin. One type of poiyketone which is known to persons of ordinary skill in th art is the copolymer of carbon monoxide and ethylene. Also known is the terpolymer of carbon monoxide, ethylene and propylene. Finally, copolymers of carbon monoxide and propylene can be made by conducting the polymerization in an essentially ketonic solvent using carbon monoxide and propylene as monomers. Such materials, particularly when in low molecular weight liquid form, have been found to be plasticizers for vinyl chloride polymers as described in greater detail in U.S. Ser. No. 595,060, filed October 10, 1990, which is incorporated herein by reference.The present invention also relies upon use of an amino acid (or derivative thereof) as a reagent for reaction with the aforementioned type of poiyketone polymer. The term " derivative thereof" is intended to cover amino acid derivatives, such as esters, amides, or anhydrides in which the amino acid functionality has been derivatized to a functionality which can be later hydrolyzed
