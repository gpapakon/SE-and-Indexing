<ABSTRACT>
A system for detecting the presence of bacterial growth in a 
plurality of sample vials incorporates a single test station moveable along 

each of the plurality of sample vials. In one embodiment, the sensor 
station is movably mounted on a rod, and that rod is movably mounted on 

a pair of spaced rods. The rod which carries the test station may move 
along the spaced rods to change the location of the test station in a first 

dimension and the test station is moveable along its rod to change location 
in a second dimension. In this way, the test station may be moved 

through two dimensions to move serially to the location of each of the 
plurality of sample vials. In another aspect of this invention, a bar code is 

associated with each of the sample vials, and the test station makes a 
reading of that bar code concurrent with a determination being made as to 

whether there is any bacterial growth in the sample vial. In this way, it is 
ensured that the results of the evaluation of whether bacterial grow
th is 
ongoing will be associated with the proper sample vial. In a third aspect 

of this invention, the sample vial incorporates a plurality of distinct types 
of bacterial sensors. Thus, the advantages of each of several types of 

bacterial sensors may be incorporated into a single sample vial.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application in general relates to an improved method for
monitoring a plurality of sample vials, and making a determination of
whether the sample vials are experiencing bacterial growth.Sample vials are prepared by injecting a body fluid sample into
a culture medium in a sample vial. The sample vial is then incubated, and
tested for bacterial growth. Systems for detecting bacterial growth in
sample vials are known, wherein a large number of sample vials are
repeatedly and periodically tested for the presence of bacterial growth.
Several types of sensors are known which have changing responses to a
light input based on conditions within the sample vial. By monitoring the
sensor response one can determine whether there is bacterial growth.Generally, in known sensors light is directed into the sample
vial or sensor. Light reemerging from the sample vial, or from the sensor,
is monitored to determine whether bacterial growth is occurring in the
sample vial. Such sensors and associated methods of determination are
known in the art, and the types of changes which indicate bacterial growth
are known.Known test systems typically hold a large number of such
sample vials. In one example, they hold 240 sample vials. With the
known systems an individual light source, an individual photodetector and
the required wiring are associated with each sample vial. Thus, such
systems are complicated and expensive. Due to the large number of light
sources and detectors which are required, such systems have sometimes
utilized less expensive light sources or detectors than those which may be
most desirable. Also, since several hundred light sources and
photodetectors are utilized within each system, station to station variations
are inevitable. That is, a light source associated with a first station may
emit light at a different intensity than the other stations. Variation could
also occur between the photodetectors associated with the hundreds of
stations. This could result in potential variations in readings between vials
within the system. Such variations are undesirable.Another problem with the prior art systems is that the only
identification of a vial located at a particular station within the system is
by a manual bar code reading before the vial is placed into the station.
Thus, if an operator misplaces the vial within the station, there may be
misidentification of the location of the vial within the station.Finally, as discussed above, there are several types of sensors
which may be utilized to determine the

A method for monitoring bacterial growth in a plurality of sample vials (32)
comprising the steps of:


1) disposing a plurality of sample vials (32) in a test system (280);
2) positioning a test station (284) of the test system (280) on a movable
frame (286), said test station (284) being capable of gathering information for making a

determination of whether bacterial growth is occurring in each of said vials (32);
3) moving said test station (284) by movement of said movable frame (286)
to position said test station (284) adjacent to each of said vials (32), and making a

determination of whether bacterial growth is occurring in the particular vial (32);
4) providing said test station (284) with the capability of gathering first and
second types of information for making the determination of whether bacterial growth

is occurring in each of said vials (32), wherein said second type of information is
provided by a fluorescent chemical sensor (38) in each of the vials (32); and
5) making a determination of whether each vial (32) is experiencing
bacterial growth with each of said first and second types of information, including

providing said test station (284) with a light radiation source (46) at a first location, a

detector (68) at a second location spaced from said first location by a first distance, and
a pair of light guide stubs (282) being spaced by a second distance which approximates

said first distance and positioned adjacent to each of said vials (32), and directing light
radiating from said radiation source (46) into one of said light guide stubs (282), and

the other of said light guide stubs (282) directing a reflected radiation out of the sample
vial (32) and into said detector (68) to provide said first type of information with regard

to whether bacterial growth is occurring in the sample vial (32).
A method as recited in claim 1, wherein said plurality of vials (32) are
positioned in a two dimensional array, and said test station (284) is moved along two 

dimensions such that it periodically makes a determination of whether bacterial growth
is occurring in each of said vials (32).
A method as recited in claim 1, wherein it is ensured that said test station (284)
is positioned adjacent to each of said vials (32) at an intended location relative to a vial

(32) to be tested by directing a beam of electromagnetic radiation from said test station
(284) to a reference location associated with said vial (32), and monitoring the location

of said reference location relative to the position of said test station (284), and further
correcting the position of said test station (284) by movement of said movable frame

(286) such that the test station (284) by movement of said moveable frame (286) is
properly positioned relative to said reference location.
A method as recited in claim 1, further comprising the steps of providing bar
code information on each said vial (32), and reading said bar code information from

said vial (32).
A method as recited in claim 1, wherein the determination of step (3) is
accomplished by moving said test station (284) in a circle relative to the sample vial

(32) around the bottom surface of each vial (32).
