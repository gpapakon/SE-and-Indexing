<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for the reaction of an alkyl 
halide with particulate silicon in a fluidized-bed process 

is described herein. The improvement comprises controlling 
the particle size of the silicon within a range of one 

micometer to 85 micrometers. Preferred is when the particle 
size of the
 silicon has a mass distribution characterized by 
a 10th percentile of 2.1 to 6 micrometers, a 50th percentile 

of 10 to 25 micrometers and a 90th percentile of 30 to 60 
micrometers. Most preferred is when the particle size mass 

distribution of the silicon is characterized by a 10th 
percentile of 2.5 to 4.5 micrometers, a 50th percentile of 

12 to 25 micrometers and a 90th percentile of 35 to 45 
micrometers. The process is run in the presence of a 

catalyst composition comprising copper and other catalysts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is an improved process for
the reaction of an alkyl halide with particulate silicon in
a fluidized-bed process. The improvement comprises
controlling the particle size of the silicon within a range
of one micrometer to 85 micrometers. The
particle size of the silicon has a mass distribution
characterized by a 10th percentile of 2.1 to 6 micrometers,
a 50th percentile of 10 to 25 micrometers and a 90th
percentile of 30 to 60 micrometers. Most preferred is when
the particle size mass distribution of the silicon is
characterized by a 10th percentile of 2.5 to 4.5
micrometers, a 50th percentile of 12 to 25 micrometers and a
90th percentile of 35 to 45 micrometers. The process is run
in the presence of a catalyst composition comprising copper
and other catalysts.The present invention relates to an improvement in
the Direct Process for producing alkylhalosilanes, wherein
an alkyl halide is contacted with particulate silicon in the
presence of a copper catalyst. This process was first
described by Rochow in U.S. Patents 2,380,996 and 2,380,995.Since then, the process has been refined and
modified in numerous ways and is used for producing
virtually all commercial alkylhalosilanes in the world
today. When one considers that several million pounds of
silanes are produced annually and consumed by the silicones
commercial effort, it is obvious why even small incremental
increases in selectivity and raw material conversion are
important to the manufacturers of alkylhalosilanes. Commercially, the largest volume alkylhalosilane
manufactured is dimethyldichlorosilane. This alkylhalosilane
constitutes the backbone of most high volume
commercial silicone products after it has been hydrolyzed
and condensed to form silicone polymers. Therefore, it is
advantageous to run the Direct Process to maximize the
conversion of raw materials to obtain the highest yield of
dialkyldihalosilane. Thus, one of the objectives of our
invention is to control the Direct Process to maximize the
overall yield of alkylhalosilanes, i.e., to cause the
process to be as selective as possible in favor of
dialkyldihalosilane. A second objective is to maximize the
overall yield from the raw materials. The more raw
materials that are converted to silanes; the more economical
is the process. A third objective is to provide a process
where less silicon spent bed of reduced activity in the
process is produced.The art has long recognized in the Direct Process
that the size of the particulate silicon is important in
determining the
