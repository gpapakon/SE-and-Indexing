<ABSTRACT>
A recording and reproducing system which has the capability of recording user data and system format data in physical blocks of predetermined size on a recording area of said tape, with the user data being identified by files and contained in data blocks having a predetermined size. Partial overrecording of data blocks can be performed in that physical blocks are retained which have valid data blocks, and new physical blocks are then recorded beginning with the rewritten data block.

(EP-A-0551973).The present invention relates to mass storage devices, and more particularly, to
recording and reproducing apparatus and methods for achieving very high density recording of
digital information at very high transfer rates. The market for mass storage devices is growing at what seems to be an ever
increasing rate with the sales of high-performance computers penetrating numerous industries
ranging from financial institutions to oil exploration companies. The processing power of these
high-performance systems, and the data they generate, are increasing faster than the ability of
storage devices to keep pace. The problem of data storage and rapid retrieval is particularly
pronounced in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A system adapted to selectively record and reproduce
digital user data from a host source on a recording medium,

said system comprising:

means (32) adapted to selectively record and reproduce user
data and system format data in physical blocks (PB) of

predetermined size on a recording area of said medium, said
user data being identified by files and contained in data

blocks, of which an integral number can be contained in each
physical block;
processing means (20) for generating said system format data
and for providing said user data and said system format data

to said recording means for recording thereby on said
medium, said processing means generating a subarea matrix of

said system format data for recording on said recording
area, said system format data including a specified

identification number (FDBN) for the first data block of each

physical block, from which any data block within a physical
block can be identified with a specified identification

number, and said system format data also including a
specified identification number (ADFN) for each physical block in

which data blocks are contained, successive data blocks
having incrementing identification numbers (DBN) and

successive physical blocks having incrementing
identification numbers (ADFN);
said processing means being adapted to receive instruction
data commanding said system to re-record at least a

specified data block having a specified identification
number, which data block may have been modified by the host

source;
characterised in that
 said processing means causes said
recording means to re-record said specified data block as

the first data block in the next physical block following
the physical block which contains the specified data block,

while generating system format data allotting to the
re-recorded specified data block an identification number (DBN)

that is the same as the identification number of the
specified data block previously recorded and designating

the next physical block with an
identification number (ADFN) that is the next increment from the

identification number of said physical block that contained
the previously recorded specified data block.
A system according to claim 1 and further comprising:

address means adapted to selectively record and reproduce
data on at least one address track that extends in the

longitudinal direction of said medium, said data recorded on
said address track comprising physical address parameters

relating to said medium and logical address parameters
relating to the data that is recorded on said recording

area; and
servo means adapted to selectively record and reproduce
servo information on a servo control track that extends in

the longitudinal direction of said medium, said servo means
being adapted to control the movement of said medium and

move said medium in a forward direction during recording by
said recording means.
A system according to claim 1 or 2 wherein all data
blocks that were located in the previously recorded physical

block after said specified data block are re-recorded in
said next physical block after the re-recorded specified

data block.
A system according to any foregoing claim wherein each
successive data block recorded in said next physical block

after the re-recorded specified data block has a
successively incremented identification number.
A system according to any foregoing claim wherein the
data blocks are of variable size.
A system according to any foregoing claim wherein the
size of each data block is determined by the host source.
