<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a phased-array semiconductor laser and more particularly to a
coupling structure for the laser.Such an array is known from
EP-A-0 456 450, a document falling under the terms of Article 54(3) which is not relevant to the question of inventive step.Phased-array lasers include a set of directly coupled waveguide amplifiers which generate
phase-locked lightwaves. Each waveguide has a terminal aperture at a laser facet that radiates the
lightwaves generated in the waveguide amplifier. The use of a set of waveguide amplifiers provides
more energy than a single waveguide and coupling the waveguide amplifiers forces each waveguide
to generate lightwave energy only in modes that are phase-locked so that the resulting emitted light
may be focused into a highly-resolved beam.It is well-known to use y-shaped waveguide amplifiers to obtain in-phase output lightwaves.
Lightwaves propagating in each waveguide amplifier in the array will be deflected into adjacent
waveguide amplifiers by the y-shaped branches of the amplifiers and out-of-phase modes of the light
waves will radiate away from the stripes and be absorbed.A second well-known coupling method is to dispose the waveguide amplifiers close
together so that their evanescent electric fields overlap. However, this method supports array modes
where the modes of the individual waveguide amplifiers are not in phase.As laser applications increase improved coupling systems are needed to provide stable, in-phase
operation at high power.An object of the present invention is the provision of a laser array incorporating an
improved coupling structure for supporting only the in-phase mode of the array.The present invention provides a semiconductor laser array as claimed in any of the
accompanying claims.By way of example only, embodiments of the invention will now be described with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a heterostructure laser;Fig. 2 is a top view of part of an embodiment of the invention utilizing radiator segments to
improve evanescent coupling andFig. 3 is a top view of part of an embodiment of the invention utilizing short active stripes to
enhance the in-phase array mode.Referring now to Fig. 1, there is illustrated an enlarged view of a semiconductor structure
10 comprising a plurality of epitaxially deposited layers 22-28 on substrate 20. In this example,
semiconductor structure 10 is a semiconductor heterostructure. Substrate 20 may comprise n-GaAs,
and epitaxial layers 22-28
