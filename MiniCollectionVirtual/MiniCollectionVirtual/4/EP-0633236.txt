<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
cased telescoped propellant and, in particular, an 
energetic gun propellant coating employing Glycidyl 
Azide Polymer (GAP) and a method of manufacturing an 
energetic gun propellant coating. Methods of the prior art disclose a gun 
propellant coated with polyvinyl acetate or polyvinyl 
nitrate (PVN) which is consolidated in a heated die. 
Such a heated die is shown in Figure 1. The die 
comprises top and bottom punches or rams 1 and 4, 
respectively, and spray nozzles 7 for spraying solvent 
6 onto a propellant 5. The die itself comprises a top 
member 2 and a bottom member 3 for containing and 
compressing the propellant 5 in cooperation with the 
punches 1, 4 which press inwardly against the 
propellant and solvent mixture under heat treatment. Modern techniques employ methods and apparatus 
which consolidate a propellant using a reduced amount 
of solvent. Unfortunately, the fact that solvent must 
be used at all requires an extra process step which 
takes a significant amount of time to complete. 
Further, once added, the solvent must later be removed 
which also significantly increases the process time 
for coating a propellant. In contrast to the prior art, for the first time, 
the invention offers a method for coating a cased 
telescoped propellant which does not require the use 
of solvent. As a result, the method of the present 
invention reduces processing time for labor intensive 
solvation, and compaction and drawing processing which 
may take up to eight days.  Further, in contrast to the prior art, which does 
not address hygroscopicity or insensitive ammunition 
advantages, the GAP coated propellant of the present 
invention offers a new material for deterring 
propellants. The method of the present invention 
inhibits water penetration into the propellent, offers 
insensitive ammunition advantages, and produces better 
ballistic performance. Thus, the performance of GAP 
coated propellants is improved over, for example, the 
PVN coated propellants of the prior art. The present invention provides a method for 
fabricating an energetic gun propellant coating. The 
method includes the step of weighing a quantity of 
propellant. The quantity of propellant is mixed with 
Glycidyl Azide Polymer (GAP). The mixed propellant is 
placed in a mold and consolidated. In contrast to the prior art, the present 
invention provides a method for fabricating a gun 
propellant coating by weighing a quantity of 
propellant and mixing it with glycidyl azide
