<ABSTRACT>
A broadcast signal receiver which has an internal clock controls an internal 
(20) or external (12) tuner which receives a plurality of broadcast signals to tune to 

a predetermined broadcast signal which includes time data indicating a local time. 
The broadcast signal tuned to is supplied as a tuned output signal. The time data is 

extracted (22) from the tuned output signal and the internal clock of the broadcast 
signal receiver is automatically set to the local time indicated by the time data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to broadcast signal receivers.As is known, current video tape recorders include
an internal clock which identifies the current date and
time, and which is operable to be used in conjunction
with a programmed record setting which provides the
function of allowing a user to set the video tape recorder
to record a video signal transmitted over a designated
channel at a specific future date or time. Currently, the
internal clock of a video tape recorder is manually set
by users who perform various steps specific to this time
setting operation. Since timer recording of a video tape
recorder operates as a function of the time indicated by
its internal clock, the internal clock must be both manually
and correctly set by the user in order for the proper
"time" recording of "programmed" broadcast signals.One problem encountered in a typical video tape
recorder is the general difficulty in setting its internal
clock. Because of such difficulty, many users elect not
to set the internal-clock, which results in a constant display
of 12:00 PM on the video tape recorder's display.
Besides providing an undesirable display, an internal
clock which has not been properly set obviates the effective
use of the video tape recorders program recording
functions. Another difficulty with current video tape
recorders is the necessity of adjusting (i.e., resetting)
the internal clock when it stores an incorrect time. Such
an incorrect stored internal time may be caused by the
removal of power to the videotape recorder (and without
a proper back up power supply), incorrect time keeping
by the internal clock, or a change between daylight saving
time and standard time. In such cases, the video
tape recorder user must again set the internal clock to
the correct time. In addition, an incorrect clock results
in an incorrect recording time when recording is initiated
via a timer record function.Documents which relate to the technological background
of the present invention include US Patents Nos.

<CLAIMS>
A broadcast signal receiver having an internal clock indicating an
internal clock time, the receiver comprising:


means for receiving a plurality of broadcast signals;
tuning means (12/20) tuneable to a predetermined one of said broadcast signals
having time data and supplying said predetermined one of said broadcast signals as a

tuned output signal, said time data indicating (i) a local time and (ii) whether the local
time is standard time or daylight saving time;
means (22A) for extracting said time data from said tuned output signal;
clock setting means (22A) responsive to said extracted local time data for
automatically setting said internal clock to said local time; and
