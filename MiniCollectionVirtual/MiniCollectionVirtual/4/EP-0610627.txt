<ABSTRACT>
Purpose

To guarantee a high conversion speed and resolution while greatly

reducing the number of circuit elements.
Constitution

The A/D converter shown in Figure 1 is a 6-bit resolution flash A/D

converter made up of a 3-bit lower A/D conversion section and a 3-bit upper
A/D conversion section. This lower A/D conversion section has a stage 1

comparator section 10, containing a specified number of comparators which
compare the analog signal to comparison reference voltages of differing

values, stepped in equal increments, an adder 12 which combines, in a
specified relationship, the outputs from each of the comparators in this stage

1 comparator section 10 and adds them in each group, a second comparator
section 14 which combines, in a specified relationship, the specified number

of addition results from this adder 12 into pairs and compares these pairs,
and a pre-encoder 16, which converts the specified number of comparison

results obtained by second comparator section 14 into 8 binary logical
outputs which can be interpreted by lower encoder 18.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a flash A/D converter.An A/D converter is a kind of interface circuit, which converts analog
signals to digital signals; it has come to enjoy wide use with the spread of
digital technology and microprocessor technology. In broad terms, A/D
converters can be divided into 3 conversion methods: the flash (serial) type,
the successive integration type, and the integrating type; however, in
applications where a high conversion speed is required, the flash type is in
widest use.Figure 22 shows a circuit configuration of a representative
conventional flash A/D converter. In a flash A/D converter with a resolution
of N bits, (2N - 1) comparators are connected in series to the input analog
signal. Therefore, for 8 bits, as shown in Figure 22, 255 comparators CO1,
CO2, ...CO255 are provided, and one of the input terminals to each of these is
the analog signal input terminal 100, connected in series (in common). To
the other input terminal on these comparators CO1, CO2, CO255 is applied
one of 255 comparison reference voltages V1, V2, ...V255, which are obtained
by voltage dividing a reference voltage (Vref,T -Vref,B) corresponding to full 
scale, using 255 equal-value resistors r1, r2, ...r 255.In each comparator COi a comparison is made between the input
analog signal VIN voltage level and the comparison reference voltage Vi. An
H level output voltage is obtained on the noninverting output of each
comparator COi when the relationship VIN > Vi is established. When the
relationship VIN < Vi is established, an L level voltage is obtained on the
noninverting output of each comparator COi. These comparators CO1, CO2,
...CO255 are latched comparators; they hold their output voltage levels when
the clock is input from clock driver 102.An equal number (255) of AND circuits AG1, AG2, ...AG255 is
provided on the output side of these comparators CO1, CO2, ...CO255, and
the noninverting output of each comparator COi is connected to one of the
input terminals of the corresponding AND gate AGi, while the inverting
input terminal is connected to the other input terminal of the AND gate
AGi+1 corresponding to the adjacent comparator. In this manner, an H level
output voltage will be obtained only at the output of the AND circuit AGi
connected to the noninverting output of the comparator COi on which an H
output voltage level exists at the lowest comparison reference voltage; an L
level output voltage is obtained at the output of other AND circuits. Encoder
104 converts the 255 binary logical outputs
