<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (2,200) comprises an 
electrical receptacle terminal (10,238) enclosed in 

insulating housing (8,220). The terminal (10,238) is 
enclosed in a passage (64,230) in the housing (8,220), the 

passageway having a flexible wall section (80,264). 
Camming surfaces (174,176, 269,282) compress the flexible 

wall section (80,264) to produce an interference fit 
between the flexible wall sections and the terminal 

(10,238). Movement of the terminal (10,238) within the 
passage (64,230) is thereby avoided when the mating 

connectors (4,6) are subjected to vibration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector according to the pre-characterizing
part of claim 1.Electrical connectors often are situated in an environment where they are
exposed to mechanical load caused by shaking or oscillating movement
or vibrations and/or stress due to thermal changes. Examples are electrical
connectors used in machines or motor vehicles. If such connectors
are situated in the engine compartment of a motor vehicle, not only does
heavy mechanical load of the above-mentioned kind occur but also high
differences in temperature occur eespecially during wintertime between
the motor vehicle at standstill and being driven.If the two connectors of a connector pair are attached to different parts
or components that move relative to each other due to such mechanical
and/or thermal stress, a corresponding relative motion between the
connectors occurs, for example between contact pins or contact tabs of
one connector and the receiving contacts, for example receiving sockets
of the other connector of the connector pair. Such relative motion causes
frictional corrosion leading to an impairment of the electrical contact
between the pin contacts and the socket contacts.There is disclosed in EP-A-0 492 479, an electrical connector
comprising a first electrical terminal having a tubular outer member
receiving an inner spring member having a forward mating portion for
mating with a second electrical terminal of a mating electrical connector,
the mating portion of the first terminal being connected to a rearward
fixed portion thereof for movement in the tubular outer member.This capability of axial movement of the mating portion of the first
terminal in the tubular outer 
member, enables the mating portion to follow movement of the second
electrical terminal relative thereto, when the connectors are in use under
adverse condictions such as those described above. Fretting between the
mating portion and the second electrical terminal with which it is mated,
is thereby avoided. In the case of this known connector, the inner spring
member is primarily intended to be mounted on a circuit board, with the
first terminal being upstanding therefrom.EP-A-0 125 786 discloses an electrical connector having the features of
the pre-characterizing part of claim 1. The anti-vibration member is in
the form of a protrusion of a flexible wall, which constitutes the passage
of a housing in which the first electrical terminal is received. When the
terminal is inserted into the passage, said protusion is deflected and

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector (4, 200) for mating with a mating electrical
connector (6, 212), comprising an insulating housing (8, 220 and

222) and a first electrical terminal (10, 238) mounted within a
passage (64, 230) of the housing (8, 220 and 222), the first electrical

terminal (10, 238) having a forward mating portion (16) for
mating with a second electrical terminal (170) of the mating electrical

connector (6, 212); wherein an anti-vibration member (80,
264) is provided in the passage (64, 220), characterized in that the

anti-vibration member (80, 264) includes a ramp surface (86, 269)
engageable by a camming surface (176, 282) to deflect the anti-vibration

member (80, 238) and to displace it into the passage to
produce an interference fit between said anti-vibration member (80,

264) and the first electrical terminal (10, 238), and that the anti-vibration
member (80, 264) engages opposing surfaces of the first

electrical terminal (10, 238).

the first terminal (10, 238) comprises an outer member (14) receiving

an inner spring member (12) having the forward mating portion
(16) extending therefrom, the forward mating portion (16) being

connected to a rearward fixed portion (23) for movement in the
outer member (14), where the anti-vibration member (80, 264) is

displaceable to form the interference fit with the outer member (14).

the first electrical terminal (10) includes a detent (52) engageable by

the anti-vibration member (80).

through slots (78) in respective opposite side walls of the
passage (64), each flexible wall section (80) being a resilient beam

supported at both ends.
An electrical connector as claimed in any of claims 1 - 6, characterized
in that the camming surface (176) is part of the mating

connector (6).
An electrical connector as claimed in any of claims 1 - 6, characterized
