<ABSTRACT>
A tri-elemental catalyst on a support that 
includes a pentasil crystalline zeolite and is suitable 

for hydrocracking and hydrogenation of aromatics-containing 
petroleum hydrocarbon feedstocks such as 

hydrotreated cracked feedstock, virgin feedstock, vacuum 
distillate, middle distillate, mixtures thereof, and the 

like, is disclosed. The catalyst is suitable for 
hydrodesulfurization as well as hydrodenitrogenation, 

thus the feedstock can contain sulfur and nitrogen in 
addition to the aromatic components. Hydrocracking and 

aromatics hydrogenation of the petroleum hydrocarbon 
feedstocks is accomplished under a relatively wide range 

of process conditions in plural process zones using the 
tri-elemental catalyst that contains a catalytically 

active metal phase constituted by a Group VI-B element, 
a Group VIII first transition series element and a Group 

VIII second transition series element. In an upstream 
zone the catalytically active metal phase is supported 

on a titania-alumina support containing about 5% to 
about 30% by weight titania in the support. In a 

downstream zone the catalytically active metal phase is 
supported on a titania-alumina-pentasil crystalline 

zeolite support. The preferred pentasil crystalline 
zeolite is ZSM-5.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst and the
uses of such catalyst in hydrocracking processes for
cracked and virgin (straight run) petroleum distillates
and residues to produce relatively high value products
having a relatively low pour point.Hydrocracking is a catalytic process which has
achieved widespread use in petroleum refining for
converting various heavy petroleum fractions into
lighter fractions and more valuable products, especially
gasolines, jet fuels, diesel oils, heating oils and
lubes oils.In a typical hydrocracking process, the
petroleum feedstock is brought into contact with a
catalyst at temperatures in the range of about 250°C. to
about 430°C., hydrogen pressure in the range of
about 14.06 to about 140.6 Kgcm-2
(about
200 to about 2000 psi), and space velocity in the range
of about 0.5 to about 2.5 h-1.The catalysts are all of the bifunctional
type, combining an acid function with a hydrogenating-dehydrogenation
function. The acid function is provided
by catalytic support of relatively large surface area
(about 150 to 600 m2/g) having a specific surface
acidity, such as halogenated alumina, amorphous silica
alumina and zeolite. The hydrogenating-dehydrogenation
function is provided either by one or several metals of
Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements in the 
sulfided or reduced state, such as palladium, ruthenium
or platinum, or by a combination of at least two or more
metals chosen from Group VIB of the Periodic Table of
Elements, such as molybdenum or tungsten in particular,
and Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements such as
cobalt or nickel. At least two of the metals of such a
combination belong to two different Groups (Group VI and
Group VIII as previously mentioned), and in order of
preference, NiO-WO3, NiO-MoO3, CoO-Mo3 and CoO-Wo3.The conventional catalysts in catalytic
hydrocracking are mostly moderately acidic substrates,
such as silica-alumina, a combination of boron or
titania, and fluorinated aluminum oxides or phosphates
of alumina. These catalytic systems are often used to
produce very good quality middle distillates, or oil
bases. Many hydrocracking catalysts on the market
consist of silica-alumina combined with the
aforementioned metals of Groups VIB and VIII of the
Periodic Table of Elements. These catalyst systems have
very good middle distillate selectivity. The products
formed are of good quality. These catalysts can also
produce lubricating bases. The disadvantage of all
these catalyst systems, all based on an amorphous
catalyst support, is their
