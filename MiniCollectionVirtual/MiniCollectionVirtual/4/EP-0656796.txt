<ABSTRACT>
A system (100) for delivering electrical impulses, comprising a current source (110) and a switch (120), of suitable magnitude and frequency to the inner lining of the gastrointestinal tract. The system (100) senses motor activity of the intestinal tract from electrodes (334 and 336). The system monitors pH of the gastrointestinal luminal contents by electrode (320) and receiver (130). The system (100) includes a delivery port (232) for administration of fluids or materials to the gastrointestinal tract, and/or for removing fluids or materials. The system comprises a pH recorder (430) and a pressure recorder (440) and a muscle activity recorder (450).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pacemakers and monitoring 
systems. More specifically, the invention relates to a 
gastrointestinal pacemaker stimulatory system that is able to 
sense and variably pace motor activity of the intestinal tract, 
having an optional delivery/removal port for administration or 
removal of fluids or recording systems, suitable for use in 
humans and in animals. The gastrointestinal tract is responsible for an essential 
step in the digestive process, the reception of nutrition in 
the human body. Nutrition is received by absorbing mucosa in 
the gastrointestinal tract, using a very complex mechanism. An 
important element of the digestive process is intestinal 
peristalsis, the coordinated and self-regulated motor activity 
of the intestinal tract. Peristalsis is accomplished through 
a coordinated combination of electrical, chemical, and hormonal 
mediation, possibly in addition to other unknown mechanisms. It is known that many diseases and maladies can affect the 
motor activity of the gastrointestinal tract, causing 
malfunction of the digestive process. Such diseases include 
diabetes mellitus, scleroderma, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, 
ileus, and idiopathic gastroparesis. Other maladies such as 
tachygastria or bradiagastria can also hinder coordinated 
muscular motor activity of the bowel. The undesired effect of these conditions is a reduced 
ability or complete failure to efficiently propel intestinal 
contents down the digestive tract. This results in  
 
malassimilation of liquid or food by the absorbing mucosa of 
the intestinal tract. If this condition is not corrected, 
malnutrition or even starvation may occur. Whereas some of 
these disease states can be corrected by medication or by 
simple surgery, in most cases treatment with drugs is not 
adequately effective, and surgery often has intolerable 
physiologic effects on the body. It is known that motor activity can be recorded as 
electrical activity of the muscle. Traditionally, motor 
activity has been measured using recording electrodes placed 
directly on the muscle of the intestinal tract, or on the skin 
external to the intestinal tract. For example, 
electrocardiograms measure the electrical activity of the heart 
in this manner. Presently, however, there is no known endoscopically or 
surgically placed device to stimulate, record, or intelligently 
alter the muscular contractions of the intestinal muscles from 
the intraluminal mucosa of the intestinal tract for the purpose 
of interventional
