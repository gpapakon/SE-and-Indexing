<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for producing 
a capsule containing a substance which is liable to acid, 

water or heat, comprising: suspending a substance which is 
liable to acid, water or heat in a hydrophobic substance 

which is non-flowable at ambient temperature; encapsulating 
the resulting suspension; air-drying the resulting capsule 

at ambient temperature; and vacuum drying or vacuum freeze-drying 
the air-dried capsule. A capsule obtained by the 

process is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a capsule capable of protecting a content from
acid, water or heat, and a capsule obtained thereby.Useful enterobacteria are liable to acid, water or heat,
and when they are directly incorporated in the body without
any protective means, almost all of them are killed.
However, by protecting the useful enterobacteria from acid,
water or heat with an enteric capsule, a surviving rate
thereof can be increased.For example, such a capsule containing the useful
enterobacteria is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 61-151127. In Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 61-151127, there is described a method for
producing an enteric capsule comprising; mixing bacteria
cells with vehicles such as starch; dispersing the resulting
mixture in a hardening oil; encapsulating the resulting
dispersion with an enteric coating consisting of gelatin and
pectin; and then dipping the resulting capsule in an aqueous
calcium chloride solution to impart acid resistance to the
capsule. In the capsule obtained by this method, intrusion
of water into a content dispersed in the hardening oil can 
be interfered temporarily by the hardening oil, however, bad
influence with time caused by residual water which is
contained in a coating of the capsule and the hardening oil
can not be avoided. In addition, in order to impart acid
resistance to a coating of the capsule consisting of
gelatin/pectin, the capsule must be dipped in an aqueous
calcium chloride solution. At this step, water is liable to
transfer to a content through a coating of the capsule, as
well as heat resistance of the resulting capsule is poor.On the other hand, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 62-263128, there is described a capsule
wherein the useful enterobacteria are isolated from a
coating of the capsule via a hydrophobic substance which is
non-flowable at ambient temperature. In this structure,
penetration of water into the content can also be interfered
temporarily, however, bad influence with time caused by
residual water which is contained in a coating of the
capsule, the hardening oil and other substance, can not be
avoided, as well as heat resistance of the resulting capsule
is poor.An object of the present invention is to provide a
process for producing a capsule containing a substance which
is liable to acid, water or heat, comprising: suspending a
substance which is liable to acid, water or heat in a
hydrophobic substance which is non-flowable at ambient 
temperature;

The process according to claim 1, wherein a coating
of the capsule has enteric property.
The process according to claim 4, wherein a coating
of the capsule consists of a mixture of gelatin and pectin.
The process according to claim 4, wherein a coating
of the capsule contains oligosaccharide and glycerin, in

addition to a mixture of gelatin and pectin.
The process according to claim 1, wherein the
hydrophobic substance contains powder having low water

activity.

than 0.20 and a thermal conductivity of not more than

0,19 W/Km
[0.16

Kcal/mh°C].
The capsule according to claim 8, wherein the
substance which is liable to acid, water or heat is useful

enterobacteria.

useful enterobacteria are 
Bifidobacterium
.
A capsule preparable by encapsulating a substance
which is liable to acid, water or heat suspended in a

hydrophobic substance which is non-flowable at ambient
temperature, by the use of a coating mainly composed of

gelatin, obtainable by the process according to claim 1,
