<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a process for manufacturing a window (glazing) made of laminated glass including one or more wires (4) which are arranged within a thermoplastic interlayer and are electrically connected to busbars (3), the wires (4) are heated by application of suitable energy, limited locally, at the connection points, before electrical connection to the busbars (3), in such a way that the surface layers (4A) adhering to the surface of the wires are thereby removed. Suitable energy, limited locally, is applied by means of laser radiation, by moving the focus (5) of a beam of laser radiation, oriented perpendicularly to the busbars (3), in the longitudinal direction (arrow F) of the busbars (3) along the latter. Next, the wires (4) are soldered to the busbars (3). The layers forming the laminated-glass windows are then assembled in the usual way and joined together hot and under pressure.

Method of manufacturing a glazing pane made of laminated
glass consisting of several layers, comprising one or more

wires disposed inside a thermoplastic intermediate layer,

according to which, before assembling the layers, a conductive
electrical connection is established between the wires and one

or more metallic elements, and then the layers are connected
to each other by means of an addition of heat and pressure,

characterised in that wires having a surface layer over the
entire length, before the electrical connection to the

metallic elements, are heated at the points of connection by a
suitable application of energy, limited locally, to the point

that in this way surface layers adhering to the surfaces of
the wire and causing an increased contact resistance are

eliminated.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that, before
the assembly of the layers forming the glazing pane made of

laminated glass, first of all the metallic elements and then
the wires are deposited over the metallic elements on the

thermoplastic intermediate layer and are fixed, and the
application of energy is effected only after the placing of

the wires on the thermoplastic layer on top of the metallic
elements.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the application of energy to the connection points is effected

by a laser beam.
Method according to Claim 3, characterised in that a laser
beam with an emission wavelength of less than 2.5 Âµm is used.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the local application of energy to the connection points is

provided by a gas microflame. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the connection points of the wires

during the application of energy are exposed to a reducing
gaseous atmosphere.
Method according to any one of Claims 2 to 6,
characterised in that metallic elements coated with soldering

metal are used and in that the application of energy is
effected in such a way that, conjointly with the elimination

of the surface layers, the electrical contact between the
wires and the metallic elements is established by the molten

soldering metal.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the conductive electrical connection

between the wires and the metallic elements is established by
means of an electrically conductive adhesive.
Use of the method according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
for manufacturing an electrically heatable laminated glass

glazing pane incorporating tungsten heating wires disposed in
a parallel mounting in a thermoplastic intermediate layer and

electrically connected to metallic elements such as collector
bands.
