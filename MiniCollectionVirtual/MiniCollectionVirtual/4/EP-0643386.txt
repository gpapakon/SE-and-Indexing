<ABSTRACT>
An object lens driving apparatus for driving, in a 
focus direction and a tracking control direction, an 

objective lens (6) for converging light onto an optical 
recording medium includes a lens bobbin (7) for holding 

the objective lens. The lens bobbin is provided with 
two types of drive coils (8, 9) for driving the lens 

bobbin in the focus and tracking control directions. 
The lens bobbin is attached in a floating state to a 

frame-shaped magnetic yoke (11) via a pair of wiring 
suspensions (5) functioning as cantilevers. The 

magnetic yoke is provided with a magnet (10) for 
generating a magnetic field. The lens bobbin is 

situated such that the drive coils are placed within the 
magnetic field. The wiring suspensions are formed of 

flexible printed wiring members and have wiring patterns 
(2a-2d) and insulating films (1, 3) sandwiching the 

wiring patterns. The wiring patterns function as 
springs for substantially supporting the lens bobbin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an objective lens 
driving apparatus and an optical head driving apparatus 
for use in an optical information recording/reproducing 
apparatus for recording and/or reproducing an information 
signal on an optical recording medium such as an 
optical disk, etc. An optical pickup device has conventionally been 
used as means for radiating a light beam on a signal 
recording surface of an optical disk, which is mounted 
on and rotated by a disk driving apparatus, thereby 
reading an information signal recorded on the optical 
disk or writing a predetermined information signal on 
the optical disk. In an already proposed structure of 
such an optical pickup device, a light source such as a 
semiconductor laser element is provided, and a light 
beam emitted from the light source is focused on a 
signal recording surface of an optical disk serving as 
optical recording medium via predetermined devices such 
as a collimator lens and a beam splitter and an objective 
lens. The light beam reflected from the signal 
recording surface is detected by a photodetector, write 
and/or read of an information signal on the signal 
recording surface is effected. In the optical pickup device, the objective lens is 
provided with an objective lens driving apparatus for 
moving the objective lens by an electromagnetic driving  
 
force in two directions, i.e. an optical axis direction 
(or a "focus direction") and a direction perpendicular 
to the optical axis (or a "track width or tracking 
control direction"). Thereby, the light beam is focused 
on the signal recording surface and scans recording 
tracks exactly. An example of an objective lens supporting member 
for supporting an objective lens movably in two directions 
is a structure wherein a lens bobbin to which an 
objective lens is attached is movably supported by support 
arms comprising four round rod members, as 
disclosed in Jap. U.M. Appln. KOKAI Publication 
No. 1-24524, or support arms constituted by combining 
parallel plate springs perpendicularly as disclosed in 
Jap. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2-179932. In the objective lens driving apparatus including 
such support arms, the objective lens is moved on the 
basis of an output from a photodetector, thereby to 
carry out so-called "focus servo" and "tracking servo." The focus servo enables a light beam to be exactly 
focused on a signal recording surface at all times, even 
if so-called surface fluctuation occurs while an optical 
disk is being rotated. Accordingly,
