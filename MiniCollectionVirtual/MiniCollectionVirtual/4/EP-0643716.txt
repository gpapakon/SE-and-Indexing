<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel quaternary nitrogen
containing phosphonate compounds. This invention further relates
to pharmaceutical compositions containing these novel compounds,
as well as to a method of treating or preventing metabolic bone
disorders characterized by abnormal calcium and phosphate
metabolism by utilizing a compound or pharmaceutical composition
of the present invention. Specifically, this invention relates
to a method of treating or preventing osteoporosis, and
arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis by
utilizing a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the present
invention.A number of pathological conditions which can afflict humans
and warm blooded animals involve abnormal calcium and phosphate
metabolism. Such conditions may be divided into two broad
categories:
(1) Conditions which are characterized by anomalous mobilization
of calcium and phosphate leading to general or
specific bone loss, such as osteoporosis and Paget's
disease, or excessively high calcium and phosphate
levels in the fluids of the body, such as hypercalcemia
of tumor origin. Such conditions are sometimes
referred to herein as pathological hard tissue
demineralizations. (2) Conditions which cause or result from deposition of
calcium and phosphate anomalously in the body, such as
arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis. These conditions are sometimes
referred to herein as pathological calcifications.The first category includes the most common metabolic bone
disorder, osteoporosis; osteoporosis is a condition in which bone
hard tissue is lost disproportionately to the development of new
hard tissue. Osteoporosis can be generally defined as the
reduction in the quantity of bone, or the atrophy of skeletal
tissue. Marrow and bone spaces become larger, fibrous binding
decreases, and compact bone becomes fragile. Osteoporosis can be
subclassified as menopausal, senile, drug-induced (e.g.
adrenocorticoid, as can occur in steroid therapy);
disease-induced (arthritic and tumor), etc.; however, the
manifestations are essentially the same.In general, there are two types of osteoporosis: primary
and secondary. "Secondary osteoporosis" is the result of a
separate disease process or agent. However, approximately 90% of
all osteoporosis cases are "primary osteoporosis". Such primary
osteoporosis includes postmenopausal osteoporosis, disuse
osteoporosis age-associated osteoporosis (affecting a majority of
individuals over the age of 70 to 80), and idiopathic
osteoporosis
