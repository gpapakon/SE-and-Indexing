<DESCRIPTION>
 Reduction of Diesel EmissionsThe invention relates to the reduction of the amount of particulate matter emitted by diesel. engines.In the operation of a typical diesel engine, fuel and a small proportion of lubricant (typically 0.0025 parts by mass of lubricant for 1 part by mass of fuel) are consumed, and "breathable" gases (nitrogen, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen), gaseous pollutants (primarily carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides) and particulate pollutants (primarily unburnt oil, carbon, unburnt fuel and inorganic materials) are produced, the proportions of the breathable gases, gaseous pollutants and particulate pollutants typically being approximately 99.9 mass %, 0.1 mass % and 0.0006 mass % respectively.Concern about the environment has resulted in a great deal of work being carried out in an attempt to reduce the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants by diesel engines. In particular, engine manufacturers have devoted, and are devoting, very considerable time and effort to the production of engines which emit lower amounts of pollutants, such engines sometimes being referred to as "low emission engines".The applicants have surprisingly found that a significant reduction in the amount of particulate material emitted by a diesel engine can be obtained by the use in the engine of appropriate lubricating oils. In. particular, the applicants have found that crankcase lubricating oils can be formulated to give reduced emission of particulate materials by diesel engines.The term "particulate material" is used herein in the sense commonly used in this art, that is, to refer to materials emitted from an exhaust as finely divided solids or liquids (that is, as materials which can be removed by filtration) 

 rather than as gas s. Other terms sometimes used in connection with such materials are "particulate emissions", "exhaust particulate" and "diesel particulate" . The lubricating compositions according to the invention may be referred to as giving rise to "low particulate emissions" or as "low emission oils".The present invention provides the use of a lubricating composition, having at least one of characteristics or components (a) to (e) below, for reducing the amount of particulate material emitted by a diesel engine:(a) a relatively low high shear viscosity and a relatively low volatility;(b) a base oil giving a reduced ignition delay compared with that given by 150 solvent neutral;(c) a zinc content of zero or of not more than 0.06 mass % on an
