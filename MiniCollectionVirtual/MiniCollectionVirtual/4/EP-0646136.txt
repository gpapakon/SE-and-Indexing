<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and equipment for the preparation of such a solid catalyst suitable for olefin polymerization that comprises a transition metal compound reacted for a carrier. In the method the reagents mentioned are fed into a reaction vessel (1), reacted to raw procatalyst, after which the liquid reaction residue is removed through a bottom sieve (3) in the vessel (1), the raw procatalyst obtained is washed with a washing liquid, which is also removed through the bottom sieve (3), after which the raw procatalyst is dried and removed from the vessel (1). The problem has previously been that the procatalyst product contains too much harmful, finely-divided material. Now, this disadvantage has been removed by furnishing the vessel (1) with a tilting means (4), whereby the reaction residue liquid and/or the washing liquid along with its impurities can be removed by keeping the vessel (1) tilted to an acute angle with respect to its vertical axis, allowing the raw procatalyst settle to cover the tilted side part of the bottom sieve (3), and by filtering decanting the liquid away from the vessel (1) through the part of the bottom sieve (3) that is not covered by raw procatalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
EP-A-0 335 551 relates to a process for the preparation of a supported polymerization 
catalyst in a static reactor. However, in this reference nothing is mentioned 
about using a reactor in a tilted position. The invention relates to a method for the preparation of a 
solid catalyst suitable for the polymerization of olefins 
which comprises a transition metal compound reacted upon a 
carrier, as defined in claim 1. Equipment for the 
preparation of such a solid procatalyst intended for the 
olefin polymerization comprises a transition metal 
compound reacted for a carrier by means of feed, reaction 
separation, removal, washing and drying operations. The 
equipment comprises 
i) a vessel furnished with an aggregate and valves for 
bringing together, keeping together and removing of the 
materials participating in the operations, ii) a mixer provided inside the vessel for the mixing of 
the above-mentioned materials, and iii) a bottom sieve provided inside the vessel for the 
separation of the procatalyst particles from the above-mentioned 
materials. For the polymerization of olefins, to which the method 
according to the invention relates, the Ziegler-Natta 
catalyst system is commonly used, which consists of 
a so-called procatalyst and a cocatalyst. The procatalyst 
is based on a compound of a transition metal belonging to 
any of the groups IVA-VIII (Hubbard) of the periodical 
table of the elements and the cocatalyst is based on an 
organometallic compound of a metal belonging to any of the 
groups IA-IIIA (Hubbard) of the periodical table of the 
elements. The procatalyst can also comprise a carrier, on 
which the transition metal compound is layered, and an 
internal electron donor improving and modifying the 
catalytical properties. The reacting of the transition metal compound onto the 
surface of the carrier is carried out between a solid 
phase carrier being and most frequently a liquid 
transition metal compound or a transition metal compound 
in a liquid. Thus this stage of the procatalyst 
preparation includes the operations where the starting 
materials are fed into the reaction vessel and suitable 
reaction conditions are created therein to separate the 
unreacted liquid from the product and to wash and dry the 
product. The carrier layered with the transition metal compound is 
available for use as a dried powder for the polymerization 
of olefins, whereby the combination with the co-catalyst 
is carried out before or at the start of the 
polymerization operation. The above-mentioned
