Apparatus for use with paper folding or other machines 
which applies a line of perforations on the paper sheets at 

selected locations and for controlled distances while the 
paper sheet is travelling through the machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for applying a line 
of perforations of controlled length to sheets of paper while 
they are travelling through a paper folding or other machine. The application of a line or lines of perforation to a 
sheet or sheets of paper to enable a portion of the sheet to 
be detached at a later time is not new. Many advertising or mailer pieces are multi-part, in that 
a portion of the piece an be detached and returned to the 
sender for a variety of purposes, such as placing an order for 
a product, or obtaining a catalog, responding to a survey, or 
other uses. It is not always convenient to produce a return piece of 
a mailing by using one straight line of perforations, and 
often two 90Â° intersecting lines of perforations are needed to 
provide a detachable postcard sized return piece. In order to put the intersecting lines of perforations on 
the mailer one common practice is to use a letter press and 
die which require additional labor and machine cost. Another 
approach is to paste a strip onto a printing roller blanket as 
backup for the die, but the resulting operation ruins the 
blanket and consequently increases the cost.  
 Another approach is to put in a perforation apparatus 
before the number I fold roller which includes a bottom roller 
and a perforation wheel which is brought down onto the paper 
sheet to be perforated. The apparatus of the invention replaces the first set of 
fold rollers and selectively applies a line of perforations to 
a mailing piece while it is in a folding or paper processing 
machine, with control of the location and length of the line, 
so that a return mailer piece is available which can be easily 
detached and mailed back to the sender. The apparatus of the invention also performs the feeding 
operation previously accomplished by the first set of fold 
rollers in the machine, which makes it useful for both old and 
new machines. Various prior art structures have been proposed which 
perform operations such as detecting, slitting, and 
perforating sheets of material, but none of them perform the 
same as the apparatus of the invention. The U.S. Patent to Taylor et al No. 3,076,365 discloses a 
machine for slitting tissues, particularly tissues to be used 
as sutures, and cut from the intestines of beef, calves, sheep 
or swine. This apparatus is designed to be operated with wet 
material presented through a narrow tissue feed throat, and is 
not suitable for use with dry paper sheets. While the patent 
discloses a detection system

<CLAIMS>
A paper processing machine which 
includes a plurality of driven transport rollers (11) to receive 

sheets (30) of paper and transport them in a straight 
line, and which further includes a perforating apparatus 

which comprises: 

a lower driven shaft (60) to receive sheets (30) of paper 
which is disposed after said transport rollers (11) and 

extends transversely of the feed direction of the sheets, 
at least one roller segment (65) on said shaft (60), 
at least one backing element (80) on said shaft (60) and 
selectively positioned therealong at the location where said 

perforation line is to be applied to said sheets (30), 
at least one idler shaft (56) 
above said lower driven shaft (60), 
a plurality of roller elements (58) on said idler shaft, 
a perforation wheel (76) for applying a line of perforations (78) 
to said sheets (30) in cooperation with said backing element (80),
 
characterised in that,  

 
for detecting the presence of sheets of paper, 

applying at least one line of perforations at selected 
locations and of controlled length, and feeding the sheets for 

further processing, the perforating apparatus further comprises: 

a rod (50) extending 
above and parallel to the driven shaft and the idler shafts, 
a plurality of idler plates (52) on said rod for 
carrying said idler shafts (56), 
a bracket (70) carried on said rod (50) between said idler 
plates (52) and selectively positionable along said rod above said 

backing element (80) on said lower driven shaft (60), said lower driven 
shaft being below said transport rollers (11), 
an electrically actuated solenoid (71) on said bracket (70), 
a vertically movable output arm (73) extending downwardly 
from said solenoid (71),  

 
The perforation wheel (76) being carried by said arm (73) and 
applying a line of perforations (78) to said sheets (30) when said output 

arm (73) is moved downwardly so that said sheets are contacted by 
said wheel (76) and said 

backing element, the backing element being provided in the form 
of a female collar (80), 
sheet detector means (41) on said machine to detect the 
presence, or absence of a sheet of paper, and 
control means (36) connected to said solenoid (71) and to said 
sheet detector means (41) which upon receipt of a signal from said 

sheet detector means, signals said solenoid to cause said 
output arm (73) to move downwardly whereby said line of 

perforations (78) is applied to said one of said sheets (30). 
Apparatus as defined in claim 1 in which 

said sheet detector means (41) includes at least one 
electric eye. 
Apparatus as defined in claim 1 in which 

a transition plate (66) is provided to support the sheets 
of paper from said transport rollers (11) to and between said perforation 

wheel (76) and said collar (80). 
Apparatus as defined in claim 1 in which 

said sheet detector means (41) includes a linear motion 
sensor engaged with one of said transport rollers (11) and which 

provides input signals to, said control means (36).
