<ABSTRACT>
An electrical adaptor is arranged to receive an electrical plug of one standard type and to be inserted into sockets of other standard types. Selection of different pin configurations to allow insertion into the various sockets is by way of a rotatable end portion having apertures therein. The end portion is large in comparison to the adaptor as a whole and may be easily manipulated for the selection of the various pin configurations. The adaptor preferably includes a fuse link in the live connection, and the fuse may be accessed through the end portion when it is in a particular rotational position.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Electrical AdaptorThe present invention relates to electrical adaptors which allow an electrical appliance connected to a conventional plug according to one standard to be connected to an electrical supply outlet of a type according to a different standar .It is known to provide such adaptors with a choice of pin configurations which may be selected for plugging into various electrical supply sockets. The selection means provided on such adaptors is typically quite small and requires considerable manual dexterity to use due to the smallness of the parts required to be moved.The present invention provides an electrical adaptor comprising a main body having first and second ends, a plurality of socket contacts arranged to receive an electrical plug inserted through apertures in the first end of the main body, a plurality of pins adapted to be selectively extended from said second end in a plurality of configurations, each of said pin configurations being suitable for insertion into and connection with a standard electrical socket, and means within the adaptor arranged to make appropriate live and neutral connections between a plug inserted into said socket contacts and the pins when in position for insertion into an electrical socket; the adaptor further comprising an end portion having a cross sectional area substantially the same as or larger than the second end of the main body and a plurality of apertures therein and rotatably mounted on the second end of said main body whereby the end portion may be rotated to a plurality of rotational positions with respect to the main body, each of said rotational positions corresponding to one of said pin configurations, the apertures in said end portion being 

 arranged such that the pins for each pin configuration may be extended from the second end when the end portion in is the respective corresponding rotational position.The present invention therefore provides an adaptor having a selection means for the various pin configurations which is relatively large and which is simple to use.The present invention preferably includes a fuse link in the live connection within the main body, the fuse link being accessible through a further aperture in the end portion.In order that the present invention may be better understood preferred embodiments thereof will be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:Figures la and lb show two perspective views of a first preferred embodiment;Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view of the

CLAIMS :
1. An electrical adaptor comprising a main body having first and second ends, a plurality of socket contacts arranged to receive an electrical plug inserted through apertures in the first end of the main body, a plurality of pins adapted to be selectively extended from said second end in a plurality of configurations, each of said pin configurations being suitable for .insertion into and connection with a standard electrical socket, and means within the adaptor arranged to make appropriate live and neutral connections between a plug inserted into said socket contacts and the pins when in position for insertion into an electrical socket; the adaptor further comprising an end portion having a cross sectional area substantially the same as or larger than the second end of the main body and a plurality of apertures therein and rotatably mounted on the second end of said main body whereby the end portion may be rotated to a- plurality of rotational positions with respect to the main body, each of said rotational positions corresponding to one of said pin configurations, the apertures in said end portion being arranged such that the pins for each pin configuration may be extended from the second end when the end portion in is the respective corresponding rotational position.
2. An electrical adaptor according to claim 1 having a tapered shape, the second end being larger than the first end.
3. An electrical adaptor according to claim 1 or 2 in which the end portion mounted on the second end is shaped so as to be easily gripped for rotation by hand between said rotational positions. 


 4. An electrical adaptor according to any of claims 1 to 3 in which one of said pin configurations is adapted to co-operate with a standard European style socket.
5. An electrical adaptor according to any of claims 1 to 3 in which one of said pin configurations is adapted to co-operate with a standard North American style socket.
6. An electrical adaptor according to any of claims 1 to 3 in which one of. said pin configurations is adapted to co-operate with a standard UK style socket.
7. An electrical adaptor according to any of claims 1 to 6 arranged to receive a European style plug.
8. An electrical adaptor according to any of claims 1 to 7 further comprising means to receive a fuse in series with one of the live and neutral connections in the adaptor.
9. An electrical adaptor according to claim 8 in which said fuse may be inserted through said second end.
10. An electrical adaptor according to claim 9 in which said end portion has therein a further aperture positioned to allow access to said
'
 fuse when the end portion is in a predetermined rotational position.
