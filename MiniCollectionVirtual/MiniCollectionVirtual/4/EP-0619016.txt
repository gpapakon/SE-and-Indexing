<ABSTRACT>
Process for measurement of the difference between the refraction indexes of two media, each crossed by a light beam. Said beams  are capable of generating an interference figure consisting of fringes, the shift of the latter being measured. According to the invention, a single means is used to detect the shift of said fringes. A phase modulation is applied to at least one of the beams and the modulation is controlled so as to shift said fringes.

A method of measuring, using a coherent light
source (1) emitting a beam F, the difference between

the refractive indices of two media (Cr, Cm), through
each of which a light beam (I, II) is passed, said

beams (I, II) being likely to give rise to an
interference figure whose shift is measured,

characterised in that one of the polarisation
components of the beam F is modified, a phase

modulation is applied to at least one of said
polarisation components of the beam F before said beam

F is split in order to obtain a shift in the fringes of
the interference figure, thus allowing the relative

difference in the refractive indices of the two media
(Cr, Cm) to be quantified, and a single means (9) is

used to detect the shift in the fringes of the
interference figure (2).
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that a Pockels cell is used to modulate said phase.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 or
2, characterised in that the function of said means (9)

is to detect the amplitude and direction of shift in
the fringes of the interference figure.
A differential refractometer, which can be used
in particular in high performance liquid

chromatographic comprising:

a coherent light source (1) emitting a beam F,
an optical splitter (3), the purpose of which is to
split the polarisation of said beam F emitted from said

light source,
a first optical element (4) the purpose of which is to
make the two coherent beams (F2, F3) emanating from the

optical splitter (3) parallel, 
two tanks Cr, Cm, one Cr for containing a reference
liquid and the other Cm to contain a liquid to be

measured, through each of which one of the beams
emitted by the first optical system (4) is passed,
an optical unit combining each of the two beams I and
II emanating from said tanks and allowing an

interference figure to be created, and
a single photo-detector (9) linked to said interference
figure,

characterised in that it also has a first, birefringent
optical medium (2) positioned on the beam F from the

source (1), upstream of the optical splitter (3), the
purpose of which is to modify one of the polarisation

components of said beam F,

a second, birefringent optical medium (5; 5')
positioned upstream of said interference figure,
an electronic system (11-18) the purpose of which
is to modulate the phase of one of the

polarisation components applied to the
birefringent optical medium (2), said electronic

system also allowing the relative instantaneous
phase between the modulation signal R applied to

said birefringent medium (2) and the signal S
measured at the terminals of said photo-detector

(9) to be analysed so that the relative difference
in the refractive indices of the reference tank

Cr and the measured tank Cm can be quantified, and
a computer system for processing the data supplied
by the electronic system.
A refractometer as claimed in claim 4,
characterised in that said first, birefringent optical

medium (2) is a Pockels cell.
A differential refractometer as claimed in any
one of claims 4 or 5, characterised in that the optical

unit combining each of the beams I and II emitted from 
said tanks has a lens (6) the purpose of which is to

crease said interference fringe in its focus.
A differential refractometer as claimed in any
one of claims 4 to 6, characterised in that the second,

birefringent optical medium (5) is positioned on one of
the beams (F2, F3) emanating from the splitter (3).
A refractometer as claimed in any one of claims
4 to 7, characterised in that said photo-detector (9)

is an optical fibre (8) in particular, one end of which
is positioned at the focal point (7) of said convergent

lens (6), the end surface of the fibre (8) which

receives the light intensity being perpendicular to the
optical axis X of the refractometer whilst the other

end of the optical fibre is linked to the photodetector
(9).
A differential refractometer as claimed in any
one of claims 4 or 5, characterised in that the optical

unit combining each of the beams I and II has the
second, polarising, birefringent optical medium (5')

and a plate (7') for deflecting the beam.
A differential refractometer as claimed in
claim 9, characterised in that the optical unit

combining each of the beams I and II also has a
reflective element (6'), the purpose of which is to

send each of the two beams I and II back through one of
said tanks (Cr, Cm) and then on to the first optical

element (4), the optical splitter (3), said plate (7')
and the second birefringent optical medium (5').
A refractometer as claimed in any one of
claims 4 to 10, characterised in that said light source

1 is monochromatic and of the LASER type.
Use of the refractometer claimed in any one of
claims 4 to 11 for high performance liquid

chromatography.
Use of the refractometer claimed in one of 
claims 4 to 11 for chromatography by permeation on gel.
Use of the refractometer claimed in one of
claims 4 to 11 for measuring the variation in the

refractive index of a solution as a function of the
solute concentration in order to calibrate a static

light diffusion device.
