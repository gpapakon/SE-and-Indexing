<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for sorting a part mixture according to density and/or grain size, with an inclined vibrating plate which can be driven via crankshafts and above which the material feed is arranged, the vibrating plate 1 being subdivided transversely to the conveying direction P into individual part plates 2, each of which is mounted separately via two crankshafts 5, and the part plates 2 being driven phase-shifted in coordination with one another by the crankshafts 5, and, furthermore, the part plates 2 being connected to one another by means of flexible intermediate pieces 3 or sealing combs.

<CLAIMS>
A device for separating a particle mixture according to density and/or 
grain size, with an inclined vibratory plate that can be driven by crankshafts and 

above which the stock feed is located, characterized in that the vibratory plate (1) is 
divided across the direction of conveyance (P) into individual partial plates (2), each 

of which is mounted separately on two crankshafts (5), where the partial plates (2) 
are driven by the crankshafts (5) coordinated with each other with a phase shift to 

achieve an undulating movement of the surface of the vibratory plate (1), and where 

the partial plates (2) are interconnected by flexible transition pieces (3) or sealing 
combs. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the surfaces of 
the partial plates (2) run parallel to each other at least over partial areas of the 

vibratory plate (1) and parallel to the overall inclination of the vibratory plate (1). 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
crankshafts (5) of neighboring partial plates (2) are angularly adjusted toward each 

other by an angle of approximately 45Â°.
