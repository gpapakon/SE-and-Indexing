<ABSTRACT>
A highly reliable vacuum switch electrode of high mechanical strength 
which undergoes little change even with the lapse of time, and a method 

for making same. The electrode consists of a skeleton of a refractory 
material of one or more of Cr, W, Mo, or Ta. The skeleton is infiltrated 

with a highly conductive metal such as Cu, Ag or Au, or an alloy thereof 
with one or more of Cr, Ag, W, V, Nb, Mo, Ta, Zr, Si, Co or Fe in a 

concentration less than 2,5wt%. The infiltration alloy is present in an 
excess amount in order to form an integral contact electrode and 

electrode support. A field generating coil may also be integrally formed 
from the infiltration alloy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
vacuum circuit breaker, a vacuum valve device herein called
a vacuum valve, an electric contact used in the vacuum valve,
and a method for making the electric contact.An electrode structure in a vacuum circuit
breaker comprises a pair of fixed electrode and movable
electrode. The fixed and movable electrodes each
comprise an arc electrode, an arc electrode support
member for supporting the arc electrode, a coil
electrode contiguous to the arc electrode support
member, and an electrode rod provided at an end portion
of the coil electrode.The arc electrode is exposed to arc directly
for breaking a high voltage and a large current flow.
In view of this point, the arc electrode is required to
satisfy the basic conditions of large breaking capacity,
high withstand voltage value, small contact resistance
value (high electrical conductivity), high fusion 
resistance, little contact erosion and small chopped
current value. However, it is difficult to satisfy all
of these characteristics, so in general there is used an
arc electrode material which satisfies particularly
important characteristics according to for what purpose
it is to be used, while somewhat sacrificing the other
characteristics. As an example of a method for
producing an arc electrode material for breaking high
voltage and large current, a method of infiltrating Cu
into Cr or Cr-Cu skeleton is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid Open No. 96204/88. Further, a similar
method is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No.
21670/75.DE-A-2 536 153, which shall be regarded as closest prior art, discloses a method for producing multilayered
contacts for medium-voltage vacuum power circuit breakers.
A composite body of metal powders is impregnated with
oxygen-free liquid copper, under vacuum.On the other hand, the arc electrode support
member not only serves as a reinforcing member for the
arc electrode but also exhibits the effect of generating
a vertical magnetic field by adopting a suitable shape
thereof. And as the material of the arc electrode
support member there is used pure Cu which is superior
in conductivity.The coil electrode also serves as a
reinforcing member for the arc electrode and the arc
electrode support member, as disclosed in Japanese
Patent Publication No. 17335/91, but its main functions
are to make the arc electrode generate a,vertical, 
magnetic field which is attained by adopting a suitable
shape of the coil electrode, allowing arc generated at
the arc electrode to be diffused throughout
