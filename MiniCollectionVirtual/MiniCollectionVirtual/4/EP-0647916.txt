<ABSTRACT>
A method for combining decoded scan fragments of a 
bar code symbol composed of a delimited plurality of bar 

code elements representing an ordered sequence of data 
characters. The method includes scanning the symbol 

along a first scan path that includes a delimiter to 
obtain a first sequence of data characters; scanning the 

symbol along a second scan path that includes another 
delimited to obtain a second sequence of data characters; 

comparing the predetermined length of the lengths of the 
first and second sequences of data characters; and based 

on the comparison combining the first and second 
sequences to produce the ordered sequence of data 

characters. In a further version of the method, the 
first and second sequences are loaded into a stitching 

buffer, and a corresponding reliability or redundancy 
buffer is also maintained where information on the 

expected reliability of the individual decoded characters 
can be stored. The bar code symbol is considered 

properly decoded only if the information stored in the 
reliability buffer passes a series of tests.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bar code scanning, and in
particular to techniques for combining, or stitching,
partial scans.A bar code symbol is a coded pattern of indicia
comprising a series of bars and spaces having different
light reflecting characteristics. Bar code scanning systems
electro-optically transform the indicia into electrical
signals, which are decoded into alphanumerical characters.
Characters are typically represented in digital form and are
provided as an input to a data processing system far
applications, such as point-of-sale processing and inventory
control. Scanning systems of this general type have been
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,251,798;
4,369,361; 4,387,297; 4,409,470; 4,760,248; and 4,896,026,
all of which have been assigned to the same assignee as the
instant application.Bar code symbols are formed from a series of bars
and spaces, called elements, which have a variety of
possible widths. The specific arrangement of elements
defines the character represented according to a set of
rules and definitions. To encode a desired sequence of
characters, groups of elements are concatenated to form a
bar code symbol, with each character of the message
represented by a corresponding group of elements. In same
symbologies a "start" and "stop" character is used to
indicate where the bar code begins and ends. There are a
number of symbologies in use, for example, UPC/EAN, Code 39,
Code 128, Codabar, and Interleaved 2 of 5.In typical scanning systems, a light source, such as
a laser or laser diode, produces a beam which is directed by
a lens or similar optical components along a light path 
toward a target that includes a bar code symbol on the
surface. The beam produces a spot on the target. To scan
with a laser system, the spot may be deflected by a mirror
that is moved with an oscillating or rotating motor to
produce a line or series of lines or curved paths across the
symbol. Alternately, the light may be deflected by
holographic or other means. A portion of the light that is
reflected off the symbol is detected by a sensor which may
be positioned in the scanner. The sensor converts the
reflected light into an electrical signal which is converted
to a digital representation by electronic circuitry. For
example, an analog electrical signal from the photodetector
may be converted into a pulse width modulated digital
signal, with pulse widths corresponding to the physical
widths of the bars and spaces.The decoder receives the pulse width modulated
digital signal from the

A method for combining decoded scan fragments or
a bar code symbol composed of a plurality of bar code

elements representing an ordered sequence of characters,
wherein the ordered sequence is delimited by a first

delimiting character and a second delimiting character, and
wherein the ordered sequence has a predetermined length (L
p
), the
method comprising the steps of:


scanning (102,104,124) the symbol along a plurality of scan paths
and decoding the scanned elements to obtain decoded

sequences of characters (S
1
,S
2
);
determining (102,104,128) whether the decoded sequences of
characters include one of the first and second delimiting

characters;
repeating the scanning and determining steps until
at least a first decoded sequence (S
1
) with the first delimiting
character and a second decoded sequence (S
2
) with the second
delimiting character are found, said first and second decoded

sequences having respective lengths (L
S1
,L
S2
);

characterized by comparing (108) the predetermined length to a sum of lengths of the
first and second decoded sequences of characters; and

based on the comparison combining (110,116) the first and
second sequences to produce the ordered sequence of

characters.
The method of claim 1 wherein the combining step
comprises concatenation (110) of the first and second decoded

sequences to produce the ordered sequence if the sum of the
character lengths of the first and second sequences is equal

to the predetermined length.
The method of claim 2 wherein the combining step
further comprises, in the event that the sum of the lengths

of the first and second sequences of characters is greater 
than the predetermined length, performing the following

steps:

comparing (114) overlapping portions of the first and
second sequences of characters; and
based on the comparison of the overlapping
portions, in the event that the overlapping portions of the

first and second sequences of characters match,
combining (116) the first and second sequences of characters

to produce the ordered sequence.
The method of claim 2 wherein,
in the event that the sum of the

lengths of the first and second sequences of characters is
less than the predetermined length, repeating the steps of

scanning, determining, repeating, and comparing the lengths.
The method of claim 3 wherein,
in the event that the sum of the

lengths of the first and second sequences of characters is
less than the predetermined length, repeating the steps of

scanning, determining, repeating, and comparing the lengths.
The method of claims 3 or 5 wherein,
in the event that the overlapping

portions of the first and second sequences of
characters do not match, repeating the steps of scanning,

determining, repeating, and comparing the lengths.
The method of claims 3 or 5 wherein,
in the event that the

overlapping portions of the first and second decoded
sequences of characters do not match, combining the first 

and second sequences of characters to produce the ordered
sequence by the steps of:


(i) selecting a sequence of the first and
second sequences of characters corresponding to the scan

path that was scanned the most times or to the most recent
scan path, and
(ii) combining the selected sequence with a
sequence obtained by removing the overlapping portion from

the sequence of the first and second sequences of characters
not selected.
The method of claim 1,
comprising the steps of:


first, determining the fixed length by the steps of:
scanning an entire representative bar code symbol
along a scan path which includes the first and

second delimiting characters to obtain a
representative series of elements;
decoding the representative series of elements to
obtain a representative sequence of characters;

and
counting the number of characters in the
representative sequence of characters to obtain

the fixed length.
