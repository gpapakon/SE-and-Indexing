<ABSTRACT>
More than 40 wt. % of the yarns forming this textile are single fibers having a single-fiber degree of 1.1 
denier or less. The same or different long fiber threads havin
g a total fiber degree of 120 denier or less are arranged as 
the warps and woofs. The coefficients W
p
 and W
f
 of sectional superposition of the warns and wefts, satisfy both the 
conditions

 and 


(b)   1.20 ≧ W

. This high density textile has a great tearstrength despite it 

is thin and light. The textile also has an excellent water-proofness. Therefore, it can be used not only for a ski wear, 
a windbreaker, an outdoor wear, a coat, a working cloth, and a surgical operating gown, but also widely used for a 

shower curtain, a table cloth, a cloth for umbrella, and others.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-density 
textile fabric. More specifically, it relates 
to a high-density textile fabric having a small 
thickness and a light weight and having high tear 
strength and excellent water resistance performance 
(resistance to water pressure). A high-density textile fabric is 
conventionally widely used as a general clothing 
material or sportswear material required to be water-resistant 
or as a clothing material such as a quilt 
tick of a bedding. In the use of sportswear in particular, the 
demands thereof are increasing year after year with the 
popularization of outdoor sports activities, and the 
demand for improvement in the water resistance property 
is increasing. To cope with the above demands, there have 
been proposed various methods of increasing the density 
of a textile fabric by decreasing the denier of 
filament constituting filaments yarn or by increasing 
the weaving density. For example, U. S. Patent 4,548,848 discloses 
a high-density, water-repellent textile fabric 
comprising warps and wefts formed of continuous 
filaments yarn having a filament denier of 1.2 or less, 
a total of cover factors in the warp and weft 
directions being from 1,400 to 3,400. Further, Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Publication No. 216238/1990 discloses a high-density 
textile fabric having a structure in which the crimp in 
one direction of warps and wefts is greater than that  
 
in the other, and filaments crossing at right angles 
with the filaments having the greater crimp are 
mutually overlaid one on another. In the textile fabrics of the above two prior 
art documents, the weaving density of warps or wefts 
alone is only increased, and there is therefore a 
problem in that the warp/weft balance is poor and that, 
when said textile fabric is treated to impart it with 
water repellency, the so-treated textile fabric does 
not satisfy the practically required resistance to 
water pressure (1,000 mm water column) when used as a 
piece of water-resistant cloth. Further, it has been said that, when the 
density of a textile fabric is increased, the restraint 
on warps and wefts is increased so that yarns do not 
easily slide and a tearing stress focuses on a few 
yarns when a tear force is exerted, and that as a 
result the apparent tearing strength of the textile 
fabric decreases (e.g., "Industrial Fiber Material Hand 
Book", page 24, Fig. 1.17, compiled by Japan Fiber 
Machinery Society, Industrial Material Research 
Society). In particular, the above phenomenon
