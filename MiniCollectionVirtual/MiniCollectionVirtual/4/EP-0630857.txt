<ABSTRACT>
There are provided a method and apparatus for cleaning contaminated 
water, for instance in lakes, marshes, rivers and 

waste water reservoirs in factory site. A set of flat electrodes 
is immersed in the water, which electrode set includes a pair of 

voltage application electrodes made of relatively high 
electrolysis capability material and a grounding electrode 

placed in the vicinity of the voltage application electrode. An 
alternating current voltage of relatively high frequency is applied 

to the pair of voltage applying electrodes to give an 
electric power to the water. A degree of quality of resulting 

water is determined as an index a measured value of oxidation-reduction 
potential of the water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of cleaning contaminated 
water by charging electrical energy to the water in 
lakes, rivers, marshes or waste water reservoirs in factory 
sites, and an apparatus therefor. The term "cleaning" in this 
specification is defined as decrease of oxidation-reduction 
potential (ORP), turbidity, smell, chemical oxygen demand (COD), 
phosphate concentration as well as increase in amount of dissolved 
oxygen in the water. Nowadays water in lakes, rivers and others has been contaminated 
with waste from general homes, factories, golf links 
and other sources to cause a serious public pollution. Hitherto, an aeration treatment has been well known for 
cleaning the water in lakes and others, which has been widely 
employed for treating sewage. The aeration treatment is effected 
by blowing fresh air into contaminated water and/or sucking-up 
contaminated water in depth layer to expose the same to atmospheric 
air. With recourse to such aeration treatment, however, an 
economically inhibited huge installation would be required for 
cleaning of water in lakes or marshes, and such mechanical water 
cleaning would be limited to relatively small areas, and the 
treatment of whole water in lakes or marshes would be almost impossible. 
The degree of contamination is determined in terms of 
turbidity, offensive smell, content of dissolved oxygen, chemical 
oxygen demand, phosphate concentration and other factors. 
The mechanical water cleaning can improve the quality of water 
in terms of selected items only. In contrast to such mechanical water cleaning, an electrical 
water treatment is found to be useful in treating a relatively 
small amount of water, for instance for the purpose of 
improving quality of drinking water such as city water, well 
water and the like, but conventional electrical water cleaning 
methods and apparatuses are practically useless in treating a 
lot of badly contaminated water in lakes and others. Therefore, 
there has been an ever increasing demand on practical water  
 
cleaning method and apparatus to be applied to contaminated 
water in lakes and others for improving human life environment. EP-A-0612693 (prior art under Art 54(3)EPC) discloses a system for 
improving quality of water which, however, does not use a floatable casing for treating 
contaminated water in situ. An object of the invention is to provide an electrical 
method which is capable of cleaning a lot of contaminated water 
in lakes, marshes, rivers and others without causing any
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for cleaning contaminated water, which 
comprises a floatable casing (1) having a hollow body (1a) and a lid 

(1b); a 
flat electrode set (2) secured on side wall of the casing and comprising 

a pair of voltage application electrodes (22) made of relatively 
high electrolysis capability material arranged laterally 

side by side, and a pair of flat grounding electrodes (21) arranged 
oppositely to the voltage application electrodes (22) at equi-distances 

from said opposing grounding electrodes; and a control 
box (3) accommodated in the casing (1), electrically connected to the 

electrode set (2) through wirings, and comprising a first and second 
high-frequency switching means (32) connected to a direct current 

voltage source (4) via an associated variable resistor (31) for converting 
the direct current voltage to alternating current voltage of 

relatively high frequency and for applying the so converted alternating 
current voltage to said voltage application 

electrodes (22), a high-frequency switching command circuit (36) having a 
flip-flop circuit to give high-frequency switching command signals 

to said first and second high-frequency switching means (32) via 
an associated resistor (37), and a high-frequency oscillator (38) to give 

high-frequency signals to said high-frequency switching command 
circuit (36). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein each of the 
four walls of said floatable casing (1) has the electrode set (2), a 

circumferential flange at upper open end of the hollow body (1a) is 
bent outwardly and downwardly to form a circumferential overhanging 

edge (1c), and the lid (1b) has a circumferential edge in the 
shape complementary with the overhanging edge (1c) of the body (1a).  

 
A method for cleaning contaminated water 
by means of an apparatus of claim 1 or 2, wherein said method 

comprises 
the steps of arranging 

the floatable casing (1) in said water for arranging 
with a distance a pair of voltage 

application electrodes in the water to be treated, said 
electrodes being made of a material of relatively high 

electrolysis capability; placing a pair of grounding 
electrodes in the vicinity of said voltage application electrodes 

in the water; and applying an alternating current voltage of 
relatively high frequency to said voltage application 

electrodes by means of the control box (3), thereby reducing oxidation-reduction potential of 
the water. 
A method according to Claim 3, further comprising the 
step of converting direct current voltage from its source to 

said alternating current voltage of relatively high frequency, 
prior to the step of applying an alternating current voltage of 

relatively high frequency to said voltage application 
electrodes. 
A method according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the step of putting 
at least one grounding electrode in the water includes the 

step of putting a pair of grounding electrodes in the water, and 
connecting said pair of grounding electrodes to the earth alternately 

at a relatively low cycle.
