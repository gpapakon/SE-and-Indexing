<CLAIMS>
A polymer alloy which comprises a) one or more
cycloolefin copolymers and b) one or more types of

core/shell particles having a diameter of 0.01 to
0.7 micrometer, the cycloolefin copolymer comprising


0.1 - 99% by weight of structural units, based on
the total weight of the cycloolefin copolymer, which

are derived from one or more polycyclic olefins,
0 to 95% by weight of structural units, based on the
total weight of the cycloolefin copolymer, which are

derived from one or more monocyclic olefins,
0 to 99% by weight of structural units, based on the
total weight of the cycloolefin copolymer, which are

derived from one or more acyclic olefins, the cycloolefin
copo
lymer comprising 0.1 - 99% by weight of
structural units, based on the total weight of the

cycloolefin copolymer, which are derived from one or
more polycyclic olefins of the formulae I, II, III,
