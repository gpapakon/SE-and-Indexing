<ABSTRACT>
An incubator for maintaining a constant temperature of biological samples in measurement vessels (13) comprises side walls (1, 2, 3, 4), a base plate (5) and, where appropriate, a lid (27). At least one of the side walls (1, 2) is thermally conducting and can be cooled and/or heated directly or indirectly. In the interior there are thermally conducting crosspieces such as, for example plates (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17), e.g. with corrugated surface, which are in intimate contact with the heated or cooled side wall or walls (1, 2) of the incubator. The crosspieces or plates (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) are arranged spaced apart and include measurement vessels (13) which are accessible through the gap between the individual plates (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) for measurements and for irradiation (illumination). The plates (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) have surfaces with parallel generators which approximately follow a sine curve. The sine curves of the two surfaces of a plate can be in phase or out of phase. The measurement vessels (13) are held in the concave zones of the plates.
