<ABSTRACT>
A low-noise transistor comprising a cutoff region 
(38; 47) laterally surrounding the emitter region (36; 

45) in the surface portion of the transistor and of such 
conductivity as to practically turn off the surface 

portion of the transistor, so that the transistor 
operates mainly in the bulk portion. In the NPN 

transistor, the cutoff region is formed by a P ring (38) 
in a P⁻ type well region (35), and, in the PNP 

transistor, by the N⁺ type enriched base region (47) 
between the emitter region (45) and the collector region 

(49).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low-noise
bipolar transistor, according to the preamble of claim 1.As known, in electronic devices, the term "noise"
indicates a random fluctuation in currents or voltages
at the device terminals, and may seriously limit the
minimum signal level that can be handled by the device.The noise in each device is due to various
physical causes, some of which have been known for some
time. Of particular interest are what are known as
"flicker" noise (also indicated 1/f) and "burst" noise,
the first of which exists in all and the second in a
significant percentage of devices.Flicker noise is commonly acknowledged to be
caused by fluctuations in the number of carriers, due to
entrapment of the carriers in surface layers of the
device, i.e. to tunneling at the semiconductor-oxide
interface. According to accepted theory, the carriers in
the semiconductor may communicate with trap levels at a
given distance within the tunnel oxide layer, and remain
trapped for some time prior to being re-emitted. In the 
case of transistors, in particular, flicker noise
sources are located at the base-emitter junction.Flicker noise is especially undesirable in the
case of operational amplifier input transistors and
audio preamplifiers.Burst noise, on the other hand, is caused by a
sharp variation in current between two or more constant
values. Variation frequency may be very low (less than 1
Hz) or high (hundreds of herz), in which case, burst
noise may be confused with a high degree of flicker
noise. This type of noise is generally attributed to the
presence of defects, metal inclusions and precipitates
in the space charge region of the junction; and the
fluctuation in current depends on the extent, if any, to
which the defect participates in conduction. The fact
that burst noise is reduced by deficiency-reducing
processes, such as gettering, would appear to bear out
this theory.In the case of flicker noise, the noise power at
the output terminals of a transistor is proportional to
IBα, where IB is the base current and α a constant
ranging between 1 and 2. In the case of burst noise, the
output noise power is inversely proportional to the
square of the gain of the transistor, so that, for a
given collector current, high-gain transistors are less
affected by flicker and burst noise as compared with
low-gain types. It is an object of the present invention to
provide a transistor designed to overcome the drawbacks
posed by known solutions, and which, in particular,
provides for reducing the noise on
