<ABSTRACT>
An assay device which includes a first absorbent material having a surface upon which is placed a binder for an analyte, and a second absorbent material which is contiguous with and preferably surrounds the first absorbent material. In one aspect the second absorbent material is less porous than the first absorbent material and guides the flow of a test sample to the first absorbent material and the binder supported thereon. In another aspect, the first absorbent material is less porous than the second absorbent material, and the first absorbent material serves to guide the flow of washing liquids to the second absorbent material, whereby such washing liquids are absorbed by the second absorbent material.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ASSAY DEVICES FORMED FROM MATERIALS HAVING DIFFERENT POROSITIESThis invention relates to assay devices which, in particular, may be used in conducting so-called dynamic assays or "flow through" assays. More particularly, this invention relates to assay devices formed from materials having different porosities.Immunological assays may be conducted by using an apparatus which contains an absorbent material or an absorbent zone which induces a flow of liquid containing an analyte through a membrane, which supports an antigen, antibody, or other type of binder for the analyte.U.S. Patent No. 4,366,241, issued to Tom, et al. , discloses a flow-through assay device and assays employing such a device. The assay device has an immunosorbing zone to which is fixed a member of an immunological pair. Located adjacent to the immunosorbing zone is a liquid absorbing zone which draws a liquid sample through the immunosorbing zone. The absorbing zone can control the rate at which the liquid sample is drawn through the immunosorbing zone.U.S. Patent No. 4,632,901, issued to Valkirs, et al., discloses an apparatus and process for conducting immunoassays wherein an antibody such as a monoclonal antibody is bound to a membrane or filter. An absorbent material is located beÏŠow the membrane or filter which induces the flow of a fluid sample through the membrane or filter. Analyte in the fluid sample will bind with the antibody on the membrane or filter. Labeled antibody against the analyte may then be added. A washing step then removes the unbound labeled antibody. The presence of labeled antibody on the membrane or filter following the 

washing step is indicative of the presence of analyte in the sample being assayed.In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an assay device which comprises a first absorbent material and a second absorbent material. The first absorbent material has a surface upon which is placed at least one binder for an analyte. The second absorbent material guides the flow of a sample to be assayed to the at least one binder for the analyte. The second absorbent material is contiguous with the first absorbent material and has a porosity which is less than that of the first absorbent material.In a preferred embodiment, the second absorbent material surrounds the first absorbent material. For example, the first absorbent material may be in the form of a cylinder, and the second absorbent material encircles or surrounds the cylinder, upon the surface of which is supported at
