<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a color image processing apparatus in 
which, by making use of an image reading apparatus of a 

digital full-color copying apparatus, the designated color 

to be obtained after conversion is input and stored as 
component ratio of color-separated image data, and 

monochromatic image data proportional to the gradation 
levels, e.g., density, lightness, luminance and so forth 

are obtained from the color separated image data produced 
from the original image,the monochromatic image data thus 

obtained being converted into the color separation data 
corresponding to the component ratio of the designated 

color to be obtained after conversion, thereby making it 
possible to preserve the hue of the designated color and to 

effect color conversion to the designated color having 
gradation proportional to the gradation of the original 

image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing apparatus and a method of image processing.
The image processing apparatus is of the type
comprising input means for inputting multi-level image
data; hue appointing means for appointing a hue; and
processing means for processing the multi-level image
data in accordance with the hue appointed by the hue
appointing means.Copying machines are known in which a plurality of
developing units are provided for different colours,
so that a monochromatic copy image may be obtained in
a selected one of the different colours provided by
the units. Full colour copying machines are also
known which operate with a combination of developing
agents of complementary colours of yellow, magenta,
cyan, and black, selectable by an operator.These known techniques only provide monochromatic
colour images, derived from the colours available.
Thus, these known methods can only be used effectively
when a mere sorting of copy images according to colour
is required.Full colour copying machines are also known in
which colour images may be faithfully reproduced by
combining different coloured toners onto the same
image. In full colour copying machines it is possible to
adjust the colour reproduction so that the colour of the
copy differs in some respect from that of the original.
However, the problem with known techniques used for
colour conversion is that tonal information is often lost
during the colour conversion process.A concern of the present invention is to provide a
method of and an apparatus for processing colour images
which can make uniform the hue of the copy image while
preserving the gradation possessed by the object image.A further concern of the present invention is to
provide a method of and an apparatus for processing colour
images which allows free selection of a hue when
converting a colour image into a uniform hue.According to the present invention, there is
provided an image processing apparatus as set out in
claim 1.The invention will now be described by way of
example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings
in which: 
Fig. 1 is an illustration of a digital color copying
apparatus embodying the present invention;Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a reader control unit;Fig. 3 is an illustration of protocols of a motor
driver 15 shown in Fig. 2 and a CPU 22;Fig. 4A is a timing chart showing the timing of signals
exchanged between a reader unit and a printer unit;Fig. 4B is a circuit diagram illustrating a video
signal delivery circuit between the reader

Image processing apparatus comprising:

input means for inputting image data representing
individual density levels of colour components of the

pixels of an original image;
area pointing means (CPU 22, 50, RAMS 136, 137) for
generating area signals (AREA 0-AREAn) defining an area

within said original image;
hue appointment means for appointing a desired hue;
and
converting means (51) for converting image data
within an area appointed by said area appointing means

into converted image data representing the desired hue;

   characterised in that said converting means are
arranged to convert the density levels of the colour

components of each pixel of the original image within
said appointed area so that the density ratios between

pixels of different hues in the original image within
said appointed area are preserved between corresponding

pixels in the converted image so as to preserve the
gradation of the original image.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
converting means comprise a random access memory (177)

into which can be written a look-up table (LUT) which
defines the gamma characteristics which enable the 

conversion from the input image data to the converted
image data to be carried out with the preservation of

gradation.
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the random
access memory is a part of a gamma conversion circuit

(176, 177, 178) adapted to control the colour balance and
the colour densities of an output image.
Apparatus according to either of claims 2 and 3,
wherein where the colour component data of the desired

hue is Ys, Ms, Cs and the colour component ratio of the
desired hue is Ys:Ms:Cs, the gamma characteristic

functions GY(x), GM(x) and GC(x) for yellow, magenta and
cyan are set in the random access memory as

Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said input means is a flat-bed scanner.
Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein said flat-bed
scanner consists of plural line sensors.

appointing means appoints the desired hue by appointing

a desired portion on the original image.
Apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said common
operating means comprises a digitizer.
