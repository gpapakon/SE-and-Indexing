<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUORINATED RESINS WITH LOW DIELECTRIC CONSTANTBackground of InventionDielectric constant is defined as a measure of the ability of a dielectric to store an electric charge. A dielectric is a nonconducting substance or an insulator. Dielectric constant is directly proportional to capacitance of a material, which means that capacitance is reduced if dielectric constant of a material is reduced. For high frequency high-speed digital circuits, capacitance of substrates and coatings are critical to reliable functioning of the circuits. Present computer operations are limited by the coupling capacitance between circuit paths and integrated circuits on multilayer boards. The computing speed between integrated circuits is reduced by this capacitance and the power required to operate them is increased.With recent trends toward microminiaturization and utilization of very thin conductor lines, close spacings, and very thin insulation of 5 mils or less, greater demands are being placed on the insulating layer. Insulating materials must possess very low dielectric constants and at the same time must retain other required engineering and manufacturing properties. For high frequency linear circuits, such as those used in radar assemblies, the dielectric constant of insulators again becomes important, especially since it may vary with changes in frequency.Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) , which is a solid at room temperature and is known as Teflon® material, has dielectric constant in the range of 2.00- 2.08 and tetrafluoroethylene which is a gas at room temperature, has dielectric constant in the range of 1.89-1.93. Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) is completely chemically inert, has excellent electrical properties, has outstanding stability, and retains mechanical properties at high temperatures. The problem with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) is that it is not processable. Teflon®AF, a commercial material, is believed to be a terpolymer of 

tetrafluoroethylene, perfluoropropylene and a derivative of hexafluoracetone. Teflon AF material is believed to have a dielectric constant of 1.92 and although it is more processable than pol (tetrafluoroethylene) , it still lacks adequate processability.. U.S.P.4,452,998 and U.S.P.4,356,296 disclose fluorinated diacrylic esters which are prepared by reacting a substituted benzene with acryloyl chloride in a highly fluorinated solvent in the presence of a tertiary amine, such as triethyl amine, or another acid acceptor, at 5 to 20°C. The monomer is purified and can then be polymerized. The

STATEMENTUNDERARTICLE 19
In response to the Search Report dated May 7,1993, and the accompanying documents, please amend claim 2 as follows: claim 2, line 3, replace "fluorinated" with —perfluorinated—;
Attached is p.15 of the above-identified PCT patent application showing claim 2 in amended form wherein the term "fluorinated" was replaced with the term "perfluorinated." Antecedent basis for the term "perfluorinated" appears at bottom of p.4 of the above-identified application. Claim 1 was also amended to define R
4
 as a halogenated hydrocarbon whereas before it was merely defined as a hydrocarbon radical.
The Foster and the Bolhofer U.S. patents were cited in the category "Y" . of the Search Report as being of particular relevance to the subject matter of claims 1-4. After stufying the Foster and the Bolhofer references, it is believed that the subject matter of claims 1-4 is not obvious to a person skilled in the art when considered in view of the Foster or the Bolhofer patents, taken singly or in combination.
Claims 1-3 define compounds having an aromatic moiety with at least two R
1
-R
2
-R
3
- groups and at least one R
4
-0-(CX
2
)
n
 group attached thereto. Claim 1 defines R
1
 as an unsaturated radical of 


2-18 carbon atoms; R
2
 as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur; R
3
 as a halogenated radical of 1-18 carbon atoms; R
4
 as a hydrocarbon group of 1-18 carbon atoms; X as a hydrogen or a halogen; and n as 0-18.
Neither the Foster nor the Bolhofer patents render obvious the compounds of claims 1-3 herein. The compounds disclosed in the Foster patent contain at positions 2 and 6 on the benzene ring substituents which do not correspond to the R
1
-R
2
-R
3
- groups of claims 1-3. Whereas R
1
 herein is defined as an unsaturated radical, the corresponding radical in Foster is saturated; whereas R
2
 herein is defined as a halogenated radical, the corresponding radical in Foster is non-halogenated. Furthermore, whereas Foster's compounds are useful against microorganisms, the compounds herein are useful in electronics.
The groups X in the Bolhofer patent do not correspond to the R^R^R
3
- groups herein and R
4
 herein is defined as a halogenated radical whereas the Bolhofer patent does not contain a corresponding radical. Furthermore, whereas Bolhofer's compounds are useful as cholestero ic agents, the compounds herein are useful in electronics.
