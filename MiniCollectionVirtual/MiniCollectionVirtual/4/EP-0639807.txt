<ABSTRACT>
A flexible assembly cell is provided for adding a 
selected one of a plurality of available components to one 

of at least two different types of motor vehicle subassembly 
(38) which may be presented. The flexible assembly cell 

comprises a work station (12,14,16,18,20,22) including a 
platen (24,26,28,30,32,34) having at least one head (44,46) 

movable thereover, and a conveyor (36) for presenting a 
subassembly (38) to the work station. An optical scanner 

(40) is also provided for identifying whether the 
subassembly (38) is of a first type or a second type. The 

head (44,46) moves magnetically over the platen to retrieve 
one of the first components (52) from the supply (50) of 

first components if the optical scanner (40) determines that 
the subassembly is of the first type, or to retrieve one of 

the second components (58) from the supply (56) of second 
components if the optical scanner (40) determines that the 

subassembly (38) is of the second type. After retrieval, 
the head (44,46) presents the retrieved component for 

addition to the subassembly (38). A method is also provided 
of adding a selected one of a plurality of available 

components to one of at least two different types of motor 
vehicle subassembly which may be presented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to assembly lines for manufacturing subassemblies, and more particularly
to a flexible assembly cell capable of adding a selected one of a plurality of available components to
one of at least two different types of motor vehicle subassembly.Conventional assembly lines for producing motor vehicle subassemblies typically include a
series of stationary work stations, each of which performs a different operation on the subassembly.
While an assembly line of this sort is suitable for mass production of a single type of subassembly, it
does not readily accommodate multiple different types of subassembly intended for diverse models of
automobile.Furthermore, the work stations of conventional automobile assembly lines often employ robots
having articulated arms. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,738,387 to Jaufmann et al discloses a flexible
manufacturing system for the processing and production of semi-finished vehicle body subassemblies
which includes articulated robot arms. A disadvantage of using such conventional robots is that the
articulated arms require a large swept out area in which to operate, which correspondingly increases the
floor space required for the assembly line.DE-A-2947745 is concerned with the assembly of an automotive vehicle. The described system
has the capability of adding one of a plurality of available components to one of at least two different
types of subassembly. This is achieved by the use of two or more assembly lines along which the
subassembly may be passed according to the type of subassembly being assembled.The present invention comprises an assembly line for manufacturing a motor vehicle by the
progressive assembly of a plurality of subassemblies, the assembly line comprising a series of work
stations for performing a different operation on the assembly and conveyor means for presenting the
progressive assembly to the work stations, the assembly line being capable of adding one of a plurality
of available components to one of at least two different types of motor vehicle subassembly, the
assembly line being characterised by: a plurality of work stations each work station respectively
including a platen and each platen having at least one head magnetically mounted thereon and
moveable thereover; a supply of first components accessible to the head; a supply of second
components accessible to the head; a common conveyor means for presenting a subassembly to the 
first work station and subsequently, in turn, to each of the other work stations; and
