<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic
photoreceptor. More specifically, it relates to a high
sensitive electrophotographic photoreceptor having a
photosensitive layer which contains an organic
photoconductive material.In the previously known electrophotographic photoreceptors,
photosensitive layers have generally been
formed from inorganic photoconductive materials such as
selenium, cadmium sulfide, zinc oxide and the like. These
conventional materials, however, are not completely free
from drawbacks. Precisely, selenium and cadmium sulfide
are required to be recovered because they are toxic,
selenium is poor in heat resistance because it is liable
to crystallize on heating, cadmiun sulfide and zinc oxide
are poor in moisture resistance, while zinc oxide is poor
in printing resistance. This is the reason why
considerable efforts have been continued to develop novel
electrophotographic photoreceptors. Researches on organic
photoconductive materials suitable for use in
photosensitive layers of an electrophotographic
photoreceptor have recently been progressed, and some of 
such materials have been put to practical use. Organic
photoconductive materials, as compared to inorganic
materials, are advantageous in that they are of lighter
weight, more adaptable to film formation, more easily to
be processed into photoreceptor, able to form a
transparent photoreceptor depending on their nature and so
on.Presently much attention has been directed towards the
development of so-called double-layed photoconductive
structures in which carrier generate layers are formed
from one compound and carrier transport layers are formed
from another compound, since these structures are
considered effective in sensitivity improvement. In fact,
these structures containing organic compounds are also put
to practical use.Carrier transport medium (hereinafter abbreviated as
"CTM") may consist of a high molecular photoconductive
compound such as polyvinyl carbazole, or a low molecular
photoconductive compound dispersed or dissolved in a
binder polymer.In particular, organic low molecular photoconductive
compounds would easily give the electrophotographic
photoreceptor exhibiting good mechanical properties, 
because the binders therefor could be selected from the
polymers excellent in film-forming properties, flexibility
and adhesive properties (see, for example, JP-A-63172161,
JP-A-63174053, JP-A-04-267261 and JP-B-93015259).Required performances of an electrophotographic photoreceptor
are mentioned as follows: (1)
