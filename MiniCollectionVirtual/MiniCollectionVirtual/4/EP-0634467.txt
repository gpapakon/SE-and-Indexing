<DESCRIPTION>
The parent invention relates to a use of a
polyoxyalkyleneglycol derivative represented by the general
formula:
R1[(OR2)mOR3]n
wherein R1 is an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an
acyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an aliphatic
hydrocarbon group having 2 to 6 valencies, R2 is an alkylene
group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, R3 is an alkyl group having
1 to 10 carbon atoms, or an acyl group having 1 to 10 carbon
atoms, n is an integer of 1 to 6, and m is a number for which the
the mean value of m x n is 6 to 80, having a viscosity at 100°C of 2 to
50 mm2s-1(cSt)
as a lubricant for compression type refrigerators in
which 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is used as refrigerant.
Such polyoxyalkyleneglycol derivative has
a high lubricating property as well as a favorable
compatibility with hydrogen-containing flon compounds such as
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (hereinafter referred to as Flon
134a), which can substitute for flon compounds such as
dichlorodifluoromethane (hereinafter referred to as Flon 12)
used as refrigerant and involved in environmental pollution
problems.The subject-matter of this application is a
lubricating oil for a compression-type refrigerator
which comprises, as a main component, at least one polyoxyalkyleneglycol
derivative represented by the general formula: 
R1[(OR2)mOR3]n
wherein
R1is an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an acyl
group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an aliphatic hydrocarbon
group having 2 to 6 valencies,R2is an alkylene group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms,R3is an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or an acyl
group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms,nis an integer of 1 to 6, andmis an integer of 1 to 80.This invention also comprises a method for effecting lubrication
in compression type refrigerators and a compression type
refrigerator system employing as a lubricant a lubricating
oil as mentioned above.Generally, a compression-type refrigerator is
constituted of a compressor, a condenser, expansion bulbs,
and an evaporator, having a mechanism where the mixture of
the refrigerant and the lubricating oil is circulating in a
closed system. In such a refrigerator, though it depends on
the kind of apparatus, usually the temperature in the
compressor rises to 40°C or more, while in the cooler, the
temperature comes to be so low as -40°C. Accordingly, the
refrigerant and the lubricating oil must circulate in the
said system without phase separation in the said temperature 
range of -40°C to +40°C in most cases.If phase separation is caused while the running of the
