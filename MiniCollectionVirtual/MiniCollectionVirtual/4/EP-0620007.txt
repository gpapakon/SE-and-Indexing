<ABSTRACT>
A composition which is effective in preventing or 
treating ulcers comprises ground germinated rice or a liquid 

extract of rice or germinated rice. The extract is obtained 
by treatment with water or an organic solvent, optionally 

in conjunction with an enzyme treatment or fermentation. 
The anti-ulcer agent mey be administered orally 
or subcutaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-ulcer agent
obtained from germinated rice and having activity
useful for both the prophylaxis and treatment of ulcers via
oral or subcutaneous administration.Uses of rice which have been hitherto developed
include 'sake', 'shochu' (Japanese spirits distilled from
rice), vinegar and 'koji' (malted rice), as well as use as
a staple food and, thus, rice has long been indispensable in
people's lives. In addition, the use of a small rice-bran
bag for cosmetic purposes has also been known. Thus rice
has previously been considered only as a simple staple food
or as a starch source, and there has been neither the
conception that rice has a therapeutically effective
component, nor that this effective component can be usefully
exploited.Current daily life involves much stress and the
chances of suffering such stress have been increased both by
kaleidoscopic changes in the daily environment, as well as
an increase in the complexity of personal relationships.
Also, the chance of taking many victuals that do not exist
in nature has been increased.In this way, the number of persons suffering from,
for example, a stomach ulcer or duodenal ulcer, because of
these factors has increased, and various anti-ulcer agents
have been developed and are being utilized. The anti-ulcer
agents that have been used to date can be largely classified
into, for example, digestive power depressants, gastric
juice secretion depressants, and mucous membrane protective
tissue reparative agents, and are orally or subcutaneously
administered. However, as these preparations are isolated
or synthesized medicaments, and each medicament has side
effects, the restrictions on the indications for employment 
and the dosage become severe. Thus, an effective and safe
anti-ulcer agent has not yet been developed and utilized.Since these conventional anti-ulcer agents cannot be
regularly used from the point of safety, they cannot be
utilized for either prophylaxis or recurrence prevention.
On the other hand, as preventatives for ulcers, there have
been used only medicines for intestinal disorders and
medicaments having the effect of preventing secretion of
gastric juices, and these cannot be said to be true ulcer
preventatives.Currently,the side effects of medicaments on humans
have become a problem and hence there has been required the
development of a medicament which has an anti-ulcer effect,
is a natural product, has no side effects, and is
sufficiently safe, even when the medicament is regularly
used as a
