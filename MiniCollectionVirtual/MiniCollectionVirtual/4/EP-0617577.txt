<ABSTRACT>
The method proposed is intended for the production of cream for adjusting the fat content of skimmed-milk/cream mixtures. The skimmed-milk/cream mixture is subsequently used in the manufacture of cheese. In order to improve the cheese yield, a fat-in-milk emulsion is exposed for a certain length of time to ultrasonic waves. This is carried out in a device designed for the exposure of such an emulsion to ultrasonic waves and comprising a preferably cylindrical vessel (1) with an inlet (2) and an outlet (3) and an ultrasonic-energy source (4) which projects into the vessel (1) and the emulsion.
