<ABSTRACT>
Such a gutter serves, for example, as a drainage means in the construction of sports facilities. It comprises structural parts (1, 7) which can be fitted together. In order that the gutter, along with inexpensive fabrication, permits simple handling during laying, the structural parts (1, 7) consist of a mixture or recycled thermoplastics. This means that the structural parts are of a comparatively low weight, with the result that they can be handled easily when laying the gutter. The structural parts are inexpensive to fabricate since plastics waste can be used as starting materials. The structural parts (1, 7) have a high dimensional stability and are resistant to oils, fats, detergents and the like, with result that they may also be laid wherever there is a need for extreme reliability with regard to environmental pollution.
