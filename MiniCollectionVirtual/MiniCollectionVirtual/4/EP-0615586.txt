<ABSTRACT>
A buffer comprises a plunger (13) slidable in a ported tube (26). A metal tubular member (46) circumferentially surrounds that part of the ported tube (26) in which all the flow resisting ports (49) are formed and is the radially inner wall of an annular space (53) filled with compressed gas. The outer wall of the annular space (53) is formed by a tubular membrane (51). The annular chamber (50) between the ported tube (26) and the metal tubular member (46) is part of the low pressure reservoir of the buffer and communicates via an annular passage (48, 48A) in the closed end (11) of the buffer with the remainder of the reservoir which is an annular chamber (54) formed between the tubular membrane (51) and the outer tubular wall (10) of the buffer. The metal tubular member (46) shields the tubular membrane (51) from the damaging effects of jets of liquid forced through the flow resisting ports (49) on compression of the buffer.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A BUFFERDESCRIPTIONThis invention relates to a buffer comprising a plunger and cylinder unit, the plunger being forced into the cylinder when a load is applied to the buffer whereby liquid is displaced from a compression chamber within the cylinder into a relatively low pressure reservoir through flow resisting means which provide dynamic resistance.In practice, such a buffer, which is referred to in this description as a buffer of the kind referred to, includes resilient means such as a spring arrangement or an enclosed body of compressed gas which provides a recoil force opposing inward movement of the plunger with respect to the cylinder by acting to urge liquid in the reservoir into the compression chamber through said flow resisting means.GB-A-1396421 discloses a shock absorber for a motor vehicle. The shock absorber serves to absorb and dissipate the energy from single or limited numbers of successive shocks such as are exerted on vehicles in the event of impact at low speeds so that, up to a predetermined velocity, damage to the chassis of the vehicle does not occur. The disclosed shock absorber comprises a plunger and cylinder unit, the plunger being carried within one tube by a closed end of that one tube and the cylinder comprising a ported tube which is telescopically slidable within the one tube and which is closed at its end further from the closed end of the one tube, the plunger being forced into the ported tube when a load is applied to the shock absorber whereby liquid is displaced from a 

 compression chamber within the cylinder into a relatively low pressure reservoir through flow resisting means which provide dynamic resistance, wherein the flow resisting means are formed by the ports of the ported tube and the reservoir is formed around the tubes by a radially deformable membrane or resilient bellows which is connected between the two tubes.According to GB-A-1396421, since upon a compression stroke the streams of damping liquid forced through the throttling ports of the ported tube into the resilient bellows travel at high velocity and consequently impinge with high energy against the internal wall of the resilient bellows, this could with frequent use of the shock absorber cause damage to the bellows and finally cause it to be so badly damaged that it would become unserviceable. With increasing length of stroke even more throttling ports are blanked off, and the energy of the liquid streams passing through the throttling ports which are the last to be blanked off becomes so high

CLAIMS
1. A buffer comprising a plunger and cylinder unit, the plunger being forced into the cylinder when a load is applied to the buffer whereby liquid is displaced from a compression chamber within the cylinder into a relatively low pressure reservoir through flow resisting means which provide dynamic resistance, wherein the flow resisting means comprise ports of a ported tube, which also comprises the cylinder, part of the boundary of the reservoir is formed by an annular radially deformable membrane, there being within the membrane, an annular member of substantially rigid liquid impermeable material circumferentially surrounding a part of the cylinder in which the last ports to be blanked off during a compression stroke are formed, whereby to protect the membrane from damage by streams of liquid which emerge from said last ports during a compression stroke, characterised in that said annular member is of such axial extent as to circumferentially surround that part of the cylinder in which all said ports are formed and said annular membrane envelopes said annular member and is displaceable radially relative to said annular member so that an annular space of variable volume is formed between the membrane and the annular member and the annular member is positioned between said reservoir part and said ported tube.
2. A buffer according to claim 1, provided with resilient means additional to any resilience in the material of the annular membrane, which resilient means provide a recoil force which opposes inward movement of the plunger into the cylinder. 


3. A buffer according to claim 2, wherein the resilient means comprise an enclosed body of compressed gas which is separated from the liquid in the reservoir by the deformable membrane and which provides the recoil force by acting through the deformable membrane to urge liquid in the reservoir into the compression chamber through said ports.
4. A buffer according to claim 3, wherein said body of compressed gas is enclosed within said reservoir.
5. A buffer according to claim 4, wherein said body of compressed gas is enclosed within an annular enclosure, and passage means contained within structure of the buffer provide communication between an annular part of the reservoir, which is formed between the outside of the ported tube and said annular enclosure and another part of the reservoir which is formed between said annular enclosure and an outer casing of the buffer.
6. A buffer according to claim 5, wherein said annular enclosure is formed between said annular member of rigid, impermeable material and said annular, radially deformable membrane.
7. A buffer according to claim 2, in which the reservoir comprises an annular chamber formed around the plunger and the cylinder, said annular, radially deformable membrane being connected to the plunger and to the cylinder, the latter connection being at a location which is further from the plunger than are all the ports. 


 8. A buffer according to claim 7, wherein the membrane forms the radially outer wall of the reservoir.
9. A buffer according to claim 8, wherein the membrane is connected to the plunger in the manner of a
'
 rolling diaphragm so that it forms an annular concave portion of the reservoir around the plunger and such that its portion adjacent to its connection to the plunger rolls along the plunger as the plunger moves in either direction.
