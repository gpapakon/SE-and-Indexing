To eliminate the sticking problem caused as a result of
ink being thickened inside a pump while the pump is on

standby, a driving force and/or a drive sequence by which
the pump is driven in a case in which the pump for expelling

ink from the discharge port of an ink jet head is not driven
for a predetermined time or more is made different from

those in a case other than the former case.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet apparatus
having a pump for maintaining ink discharge from a discharge
port of an ink jet head in a satisfactory condition and for
discharging ink from the discharge port in order to recover
such a condition, and a method of driving the ink jet
apparatus.As a pump which is an ink expelling means mounted in a
recovery system of an ink jet recording apparatus, a plunger
pump has mainly been formed, for example, into a unit and
used. In this pump, the contact seal surface between a
piston which reciprocates inside the cylinder and the
cylinder is in close contact with the inner surface of the
cylinder. A seal member provided between the piston and the
cylinder is in close contact with the shaft (plunger) of the
piston.In such a conventional ink jet recording apparatus,
as, for example, disclosed in EP-A-0 540 344,
there is a case in which ink deposited on the contact seal 
surface of the piston and a seal member is thickened, for
example, after the ink jet recording apparatus is left to
stand for a long period of time. Also, since pressure is
applied to the contact seal surface of the piston all the
time so that the piston is brought into close contact with
the inner surface of the cylinder, there is a case in which
the piston is stuck fast to the inner surface of the
cylinder by the thickened ink. Further, since pressure is
applied to the seal member all the time so as to be brought
into close contact with the plunger, there is a case in
which the seal member is stuck fast to the plunger by the
thickened ink.As a result, when the pump is driven after the ink jet
apparatus is left to stand for some time, the pump is stuck
fast to such an extent above the drive energy generated by
the drive source, making the apparatus inoperable, and the
apparatus may be forced to be repaired. Since this causes
the reliability of the apparatus to be reduced considerably,
generally speaking, a method of handling is employed such
that the driving force of the drive source is increased more
than required so as to drive the pump unit even if the pump
is stuck fast. However, in such a method of handling, extra
energy is consumed when the pump is not stuck fast, as well
as extra energy appears mainly as noise, which is
problematical. When, in particular, a water resistant ink 
is used, since the ink has a relatively high proportion of
non-volatile components, the above-described problem is more
likely to occur.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
ink jet apparatus
