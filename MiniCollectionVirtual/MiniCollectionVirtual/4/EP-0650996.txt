<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of copolymers with magnetic properties, including a first stage of copolymerisation by oxidation in acidic medium of a first monomer chosen from optionally substituted aniline and of a second monomer chosen from substituted aminoaromatic compounds, which comprises:   - an induction stage during which the first monomer is brought into contact with at least one oxidising agent and at least one initiating agent, - and a production stage during which, after the introduction of the second monomer, at least one oxidising agent and at least one initiating agent are gradually added.

A method of manufacturing copolymers having magnetic properties, the
method comprising a first step of copolymerization, by oxidation in an acid

medium, of a first monomer selected from aniline, possibly substituted aniline,
and the corresponding iminoquinone forms, and of a second monomer,

different from said first monomer, selected from substituted amino
compounds comprising at least two condensed benzene nuclei, substituted

polycyclic compounds comprising at least one aniline unit in their structure,
the compounds derived from aniline carrying a substituent connected to the

nucleus by an ethynylidene or a paraphenylene side-chain, and the
corresponding iminoquinone compounds, said method comprising a first step

of copolymerization and a second step of separating the copolymer,
characterized by the fact that said first step comprises:


an induction stage during which said first monomer is put into the
presence of at least one oxidizing agent and at least one initiating agent and

during which a quantity is added that is not greater than 5% of the total
quantity of said oxidizing agent, the duration of said induction phase being

determined by the appearance of a very fine precipitate; and
a production stage during which, after said second monomer has been
added, at least one oxidizing agent and at least one initiating agent are added

progressively.
A method according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the duration
of said induction stage is greater than 1 minute and less than 1 hour.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized by the fact that during
said induction stage, not more than 5% of the total quantity of said oxidizing

agent is added and not more than 25% of the total quantity of said initiating
agent is added, the remaining quantities of said agents being added during

said production stage.
A method according to any preceding claim, characterized in that said
initiating agent is selected from oligomers obtained from aniline and

derivatives thereof.
A method according to claim 4, characterized by the fact that said initiating
agent is N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that said
oxidizing agent is a compound from the group comprising persulfates,

biochromates, chromates, iodates, permanganates, and oxygenated water.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that said
oxidizing agent is gaseous oxygen.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that
copolymerization is performed by oxidation in the presence of an active

electrode under tension.
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 8, characterized in that
oxidization is performed in the presence of a catalyst.
A method according to any preceding claim, characterized by the fact that
said monomer is selected from aniline, optionally substituted by a substituent

selected from the radical -CF
3
, the radical -OCH
3
, an alkyl radical, and a
substituent having the formula -A-Z in which A is a hydrocarbon radical

having 2 to 8 carbon atoms having at least one heteroatom selected from O
and S inserted therein, and Z is at least one proton donor substituent or a salt

thereof, and the corresponding iminoquinone forms.
A method according to any preceding claim, characterized by the fact that
said second monomer is selected from:


8-amino-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid;
5-amino-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid;
1-amino-5-naphthalenesulfonic acid;

1-naphthylamino-5,7-disulfonic acid; and
1-naphthylamino-6,8-disulfonic acid.
A manufacturing method according to any preceding claim, characterized
in that said method further includes a third step of extracting the soluble

phase of the copolymer. 
A manufacturing method according to claim 12, characterized in that said
method further includes a third step in which a soluble phase is extracted

from said copolymer by making a solution by means of a volatile base, and
then rapidly evaporating said solution in a vacuum, with the solid residue

being subjected to heat treatment.
A manufacturing method according to claim 13, characterized in that said
soluble phase is extracted by making a solution in anhydrous liquid ammonia.
A manufacturing method according to claim 12, characterized in that said
method further includes a third step in which a soluble phase is extracted

from said copolymer by making a basic solution, and then making said
solution acidic so as to precipitate said soluble phase.
