<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to toner compositions, and more
specifically, the present invention is directed to toner compositions containing a
polyesteramide-siloxane resin.In designing resins for toner compositions, it is generally desired that the glass
transition temperature of the resin be from about 50°C to about 65°, and preferably no less
than about 55°C so that, for example, the toner particles do not aggregate, coalesce or block
during manufacturing, transport or storage, or until the toner is needed for fixing. Moreover,
low relative humidity sensitivity of toners are desired such that the triboelectric charge is stable
to changes in environmental humidity conditions. Copiers and printers equipped with pressure
fuser rolls normally employ release agents, such as silicone oil and the like, to prevent the toner
from offsetting on the rolls during the transfix step. Toner offset onto the fuser rolls can cause
ghosting and image deterioration on subsequent copies and such offset also reduces the
lifetime of the fuser. Therefore, especially with xerographic copiers and printers utilizing
pressure fixing rollers, release agents, such as silicone oils, are replenished regularly since some
of the oil transfers onto the paper during transfix and is lost. There is a need for fuser rolls
which do not necessitate the use of release agents, such as silicone oil on the fuser rolls, hence
reducing the need of silicone oil and replenishing mechanism thereof, thereby reducing the
cost of such equipment. With the toners of the present invention, such fuser release agents,
specifically agents like an γ-alkylaminosiloxane oil is minimized or avoided as the toner will not
usually offset onto the fuser rolls during the transfix step. This is accomplished, in the present
invention in embodiments, by providing an oilless toner wherein the resin is comprised of a
polesteramide-siloxane material. Moreover, the toner of the present invention displays other
advantages as indicated herein, such as low fixing temperatures of from about 120°C to about
140°C, high gloss such as from about 50 gloss units to about 80 gloss units, nonvinyl offset
properties, and low relative humidity sensitivity such as from about 1.01 to about 2.5. These
and other advantages are attained by the toner compositions of this invention, which
compositions are comprised of a pigment, optionally a charge control agent, a polyesteramide-siloxane
resin derived from a polyester and alkylaminosiloxane, and optional known toner
additives, which
