<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are methods for enhancing the quality of printing on cotton-containing fabrics. Specifically, these methods disclosed herein recite the pretreatment of cotton-containing fabrics with cellulase prior to printing with a dye in order to enhance printing characteristics on the fabric such as dye uptake, enhanced clarity, reduced dye bleeding, and the like. The methods disclosed herein generally entail treating cotton-containing fabrics with an aqueous cellulase formulation and preferably with an aqueous cellulase solution under agitating conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to methods for enhancing
the quality of printing on resinated and non-resinated
cotton fabrics using colorant compositions containing a
dye. Specifically, this invention is directed to
methods of pretreating resinated and non-resinated
cotton fabrics with an aqueous cellulase formulation
prior to printing an image onto the fabric with a dye
composition so as to enhance printing qualities on the
fabric such as reduced dye bleeding. The methods
disclosed herein generally entail treating cotton
fabrics with an aqueous cellulase formulation followed
by drying the fabrics and then printing on the fabrics
with a dye composition.Aesthetic and/or informational images are often
placed on cotton fabrics with dye or pigment (i.e.,
colorant compositions) compositions by methods such as
silk screening, painting, etc. While such methodology
is well known in the art, these methods entail numerous
problems which must be overcome in order to impart and
retain quality images on cotton fabrics. Specifically,
the placement of an image onto a cotton fabric can
result in bleeding of the colorant composition into the
fabric. Bleeding occurs because of diffusion of the
colorant composition beyond its intended boundary and
leads to blurring of the image and loss of resolution. 
In order to overcome this problem, the colorant
composition to be used will generally incorporate an
additive which minimizes bleeding. Specifically, with
dye compositions, a thickener is generally employed
whereas, with pigment compositions, a binder/extender is
generally employed. One of the functions of these
additives is to provide sufficient viscosity to the
colorant composition so that, upon application to cotton
fabrics, the composition is resistant to bleeding. A
problem with this approach is that the optimum level of
thickener or binder for one type of cotton fabric (e.g.,
knits) is often different from the optimum level of
thickener or binder for another type of cotton fabric
(e.g., wovens). Moreover, some cotton fabrics are more
susceptible to bleeding than others and accordingly,
even when a thickener or binder is employed at an
optimum level, the colorant composition may still
exhibit some bleeding.This problem of colorant bleeding is a particular
problem with dye compositions and imparts a significant
impediment to providing high quality cotton fabrics
having images painted or silk-screened thereon using
such a dye composition.The present invention is directed to the discovery
that pretreating cotton fabrics with
