<ABSTRACT>
Hinged-lid boxes having a box part (12) and a lid (13) linked to a rear wall of the box are known worldwide in the design with an inserted collar. The design with rounded or polygonal longitudinal edges (10, 11) is likewise already known. A front wall (20) of the lid is usually of two-layer design. A front edge of the lid is correspondingly aligned so as to be straight and horizontal. The new hinged-lid box is characterised in that the front wall (20) of the lid is of single-layer design and is rounded in the manner of a tongue in a lower region facing the box part, forming a rounded free front edge (37) of the lid. The hinged-lid box is thus designed in total to use less material and it allows an arrangement of blanks within a batch which likewise uses less material.

Hinge-lid box preferably consisting of thin 
cardboard, having a box part (12) and a lid (13) connected 

pivotably thereto, in particular for receiving a 
cigarette group, the hinge-lid box being designed as a 

round-edge pack, i.e. with rounded or polygonal upright 
longitudinal edges (10, 11), there being arranged, in the 

box part (12), a collar (26) which partially projects out 
of said box part and has a collar front wall (27) and 

collar side walls (28, 29), a region (32) of the collar 
(26), which region projects out of the box part (12), 

being enclosed by the lid (13) when the latter is in the 
closed position, and lid-side closure edges in the region 

of box side walls (17) and lid side walls (23) sloping 
downwards towards the front side of the pack, characterized 

in that a lid front wall (20) is of a single-layered 
design and, in a bottom region directed towards the box 

part (12), is rounded in the manner of a tongue, forming 
a rounded free lid front edge (37) in the process, and in 

that, in the region of the rounded or polygonal longitudinal 
edges (10, 11) as well, the lid front edge (37) 

forms closure edges which slope downwards towards the 
front side of the pack. 
Hinge-lid box according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that, with respect to the inclination, in the region 

of the rounded or polygonal longitudinal edges (10, 11), 
the lid front edge (37) forms a continuation of the lid-side, 

obliquely directed closure edges in the region of 
the lid side walls (23). 
Hinge-lid box according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized  
 

in that the shape of the lid front edge (37) 
forms a continuation of the inclination of the lid-side 

closure edges in the region of the lid side walls (23) 
(continuation of mating edges 34). 
Hinge-lid box according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, disregarding the collar (26), the 

borders of a lid front wall (14) with adjoining side tabs 
(19) are designed to correspond to the end contour of the 

lid front wall (20) including lid side tabs (24), such 
that blanks for the hinge-lid boxes can be separated from 

one another in this region without any waste being 
produced. 
Hinge-lid box according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that, in the closed position of the lid, 

the rounded free lid front edge (37) butts against the 
front edge (36) of the box front wall (14).
