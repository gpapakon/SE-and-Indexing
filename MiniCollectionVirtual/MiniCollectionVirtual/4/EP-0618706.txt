<ABSTRACT>
Statistical gain is desirable on ATM links, especially on high-cost international 
links. 
Statistical gain may be provided where STM traffic is carried as cells on an ATM 
bearer, the cells having a bit-stream based AAL format including a map indicating any 

STM idle channels, the idle channels not being transmitted in the cells. Preferably the 
format is AAL Type 1 for structured data and the map is carried using the extension 

mechanism of the format.

<DESCRIPTION>
A way is described by which a telecommunications system cross-connect can be
enhanced to provide statistical gain on telephony and other constant bit-rate traffic over
high cost international links.An interest has been expressed in the use of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
as a means to obtain statistical gain in an existing network, particularly on the high-cost
international links.The concern is with savings for the transmission of Synchronous traffic, not ATM
services, so the problem must be addressed in the way the Synchronous Transfer Mode
(STM) service is mapped onto the ATM bearer.A detailed description of the definition of ATM adaptation layer 1 is given in ITU-T
recommendation I-363 dated March 1993, see section 2. An example of ATM 2Mbit/s
interworking is given in Electronics and Communication Engineering Journal, volume 4
number 6, dated 1st December 1992, pages 385-393, Potts M: "Exploitation of an ATM
Testbed for Broadband Experiments and Applications" - see section 6.It has been suggested that the frame mapping from a 2M connection on to the ATM
cell stream could be adjusted to leave out idle channels, by examining the signalling
channel to determine which channels are in use.This suggestion does not work as, while a Digital Signalling System 1 (DSS1)
system does use channel 16 of the Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) structure for signalling.
the same assumption does not apply to Signalling System 7 (SS7) that may even be running 
on a different transmission bearer, DSS1 and SS7 being CCITT (now renamed ITU-T)
standards.According to the present invention there is provided a method of providing
statistical gain where Synchronous Transfer Mode (STM) traffic is carried as cells on an
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) bearer the cells having a bit-stream based ATM
Adaption Layer (AAL) format including a map indicating any STM idle channels, the idle
channels not being transmitted in the cells.According to the present invention there is provided a method of providing
statistical gain where synchronous transfer mode (STM) traffic is carried as cells on an
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) bearer, the cells having a bit-stream based ATM
adaptation layer (AAL) format characterised by including a map indicating a repeating
pattern on a channel or channels, the channels where the pattern is the same as that already
carried on that channel not being transmitted in the cells.According the present invention there is provided a method of providing statistical
gain where synchronous transfer mode (STM)

A method of providing statistical gain where Synchronous Transfer Mode (STM)
traffic is carried as cells on an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) bearer the cells having

a bit-stream based ATM Adaption Layer (AAL) format characterised by including a map
indicating any STM idle channels, the idle channels not being transmitted in the cells.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the map also indicates a repeating pattem
on a channel or channels, the channels where the pattern is the same as that already carried

on that channel not being transmitted in the cells.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the map also indicates
channels not having an audio content, such channels not being transmitted in the cells.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein a predetermined minimum
number of channels is transmitted, including idle channels as necessary.
A method of providing statistical gain where synchronous transfer mode (STM)
traffic is carried as cells on an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) bearer, the cells having

a bit-stream based ATM adaptation layer (AAL) format characterised by including a map
indicating a repeating pattern on a channel or channels, the channels where the pattern is

the same as that already carried on that channel not being transmitted in the cells.

a bit-stream based ATM adaptation layer (AAL) format characterised by including a map
indicating channels not having an audio content, such channels not being transmitted in the

cells.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the AAL format is AAL Type 
1 for structural data and the map is carried using the extension mechanism thereof.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein when the contents of the map
remain constant from one cell to the succeeding cell or over a series of succeeding cells,

the map is omitted from at least one of the succeeding cells.
A method as claimed in Claim 7 or any appendant thereto, wherein the presence of
a map is indicated by the setting of the pointer reserved bit.
