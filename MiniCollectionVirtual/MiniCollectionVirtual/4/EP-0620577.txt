<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrical push-button switch having at least one contact point (10) with in each case at least one stationery contact (12, 14) and one moving contact (16), which is designed as a contact rocker (which is acted on by a first spring (22)) and can be operated by an operating element (30) which is acted on by a second spring (28) (which is used as a resetting spring), the moving contact (16) being constructed as an assembly comprising the contact rocker (18), the first spring (22) and a rocker support (20), and the moving contact (16) being provided with at least one blade mounting between relatively moving parts.

Electric pushbutton switch having at least one 
contact point (10) having in each case at least one fixed 

contact (12, 14) and one movable contact (16), which is 
designed as a contact rocker (18) acted on by a first 

spring (22) and can be actuated by an actuating element 
(30) acted on by a second spring (28), which serves as a 

restoring spring, characterized in that the movable 
contact (16) is designed as an assembly comprising the 

contact rocker (18), the first spring (22) and a rocker 
carrier (20), in that the movable contact (16) is 

provided with at least one knife-edge bearing between 
parts which move relative to one another, and in that the 

contact rocker (18) can be acted on, by means of an 
actuator (24) which is articulated pivotably on the 

actuating element (30), via lugs (18.4; 18.5) which are 
integrally formed on the lateral edge of the said contact 

rocket. 
Electric pushbutton switch according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that a bistable bearing of the contact 
rocker (18) is provided. 
Electric pushbutton switch according to Claim 1 
or 2, characterized in that provision is made of two 

fixed contacts (12, 14) per contact point (10), which are 
connected up alternatively. 
Electric pushbutton switch according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the knife-edge 

bearing is provided between the contact rocker (18) and 
the rocker carrier (20). 
Electric pushbutton switch according to one of  
 

Claims 1 to 3 or according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the knife-edge bearing is provided between the 

contact rocker (18) and the first spring (22). 
Electric pushbutton switch according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3 or according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 

in that the knife-edge bearing is provided between the 
first spring (22) and the rocker carrier (20). 
Electric pushbutton switch according to Claims 4 
to 6, characterized in that the knife-edge bearing is 

provided both between the contact rocker (18) and the 
rocker carrier (20) and between the rocker carrier (20) 

and the first spring (22) and also between the contact 
rocker (18) and the first spring (22). 
Electric pushbutton switch according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the first 

spring (22) is designed as a leaf spring. 
Electric pushbutton switch according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the second 

spring is designed as a helical compression spring. 
Electric pushbutton switch according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the current 

feeding of the movable contact (16) is provided via the 
rocker carrier (20) including the bearing points into the 

contact rocker (18). 
Electric pushbutton switch according to one of 
the preceding Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the 

current feeding of the movable contact (16) is provided 
by means of a flexible conductor element connected to the 

contact rocker (18). 
Electric pushbutton switch according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the knife-edge 

bearing consists of a trough-shaped receptacle part 
(20.1, 22.1) on which the mating piece (18.1, 18.3, 20.4) 

is supported with a straight edge, which edge has an 
angle of at most 90°, preferably 30°.
