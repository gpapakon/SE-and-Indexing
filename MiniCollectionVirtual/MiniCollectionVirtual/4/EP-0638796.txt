<ABSTRACT>
A gas sampling system utilizing a pair of parallel 
constant flow orifices (58,64). One (58) of the orifices 

is connected to a source of filtered, heated samples. The 
second, larger orifice (64) is connected to a source (60) 

of dilution gas. A vacuum pump (48) maintains a 
substantial vacuum behind the orifices (58,64), thus 

assuring critical flow therethrough. The sample and 
diffusion gas are mixed behind the orifices (58,64) and 

transported under partial vacuum for analysis. The 
dewpoint of the sample is affected by both the ratio of 

the diameter of orifices (58,64) and the degree of vacuum 
transporting the gas mixture. As such, the dew point can 

be varied over a wide range by selected combinations of 
orifice ratio and vacuum pump strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to extractive 
gas sampling systems such as are used for analysis of 
process gases or fossil feel combustive gases being 
vented through a stack. An important category of extractive gas sampling 
relates to the compliance monitoring requirements 
enforced by the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA). Many sources of air pollution, such as 
fossil-fueled power plants, incinerators, metal smelters, 
and cement kilns, are required to monitor levels of 
certain gaseous species that are released into the 
atmosphere. These species include sulfur dioxide, 
nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and 
oxygen. The EPA standards for compliance monitoring 
systems are delineated in Volume 40 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations. The gas streams to be monitored typically have 
certain intrinsic characteristics which complicate 
testing. For example, they generally contain 6% to 20%  
 
by volume of evaporated moisture, which results in a 
sample dew point well above that of normal ambient 
temperatures. Also, the gas streams often contain 
significant amounts of condensed moisture in the form of 
entrained water droplets and fog. Acid gases, such as 
sulfur dioxide are also generally present. Additionally, 
the gas streams invariably contain large quantities of 
particulate debris such as soot, fly-ash from fossil 
fuels and process material. In order to analyze a sample for its gaseous 
constituents, it is necessary to remove the particulates 
and transport the sample to a remote location suitable 
for the operation of gas analysis instrumentation. For 
accurate measurements and for reliability of the test 
equipment, it is necessary to ensure that moisture and 
gases will not condense either in the sample probe, the 
sample lines, or the analyzers. However, the methods 
used to accomplish these goals must not themselves alter 
the samples in a way that negatively impacts testing 
accuracy. In the past, two basic types of sampling 
systems have been developed for analysis of gaseous 
mixtures. The first type, the traditional extractive 
system, is shown in Figure 1. Many vendors have supplied 
similar systems over the years. This system, however,  
 
has proved to have many undesirable drawbacks as 
described below. The second type, illustrated in Figure 2, is a 
venturi dilution probe system. This type of system was 
developed in the 1980s primarily in response to perceived 
inadequacies with the traditional system. As discussed 
more fully below, however,

An apparatus for collecting a gas sample from a 
system, the apparatus comprising: 


a) a collection probe (50) adapted to draw a portion 
of gas from the system (47); 
b) a first conduit (57) connected to the probe (50) 
and having a first orifice (58) therein through which the 

system gas is drawn; 
c) means (60) for supplying a dilution gas; 
d) a second conduit (62) connected to the means (60)

mixture of the dilution gas and the system gas; 
c) drawing a vacuum on the mixture to provide a 
first desired flow of the portion drawn from the system 

through the first orifice (58) and a second desired flow 
of the dilution gas drawn through the second orifice (64),
