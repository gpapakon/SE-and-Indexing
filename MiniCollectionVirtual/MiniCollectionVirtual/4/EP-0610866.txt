<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a centrifugal pump with an outlet issuing from the pump chamber 2 and branching into two outlet channels (ducts) 6, 7. Arranged at the branched point 8 is a reversing valve 9 which alternately opens one outlet channel and closes the other outlet channel. The reversing valve 9 switches over automatically in the event of a pressure drop in the outlet to a value of approximately zero or to a negative value (suction).

A centrifugal pump having an outlet which extends from the 
pump chamber (2) and branches into two outlet channels (6, 7), a 

changeover valve being disposed in the branching place (8) which 
alternately opens one outlet channel and closes the other outlet 

channel, characterized in that the valve adjusting member (10) is 
so constructed that with a change in pressure said member 

switches over from a first end position, closing one outlet 
channel (6, 7), to a second end position, closing the other 

outlet channel (7, 6) and vice versa, the change in pressure 
being a brief drop in pressure caused by the stopping of the 

pump. 
A centrifugal pump according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the stopping of the pump is effected by a change in the 

direction of rotation. 
A centrifugal pump according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the valve adjusting member (10) of the changeover valve 
(9) 
is a flap. 
A centrifugal pump according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the pump has a preferred main direction of 

rotation. 
A centrifugal pump according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical and/or 

mechanical boosting means are provided, which move the valve  
 

adjusting member (10) some distance beyond a central position in 
the direction of the other end position if the pressure drops. 
A centrifugal pump according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the means comprise a spring, more particularly an elastic 

spring. 
A centrifugal pump according to claims 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the means comprise an over-centre device. 
A centrifugal pump according to claims 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the means comprise a hydraulic cylinder which acts upon 

the valve adjusting member and can be actuated by pressures in 
the pump and/or at the outlet/in the outlet channels.
