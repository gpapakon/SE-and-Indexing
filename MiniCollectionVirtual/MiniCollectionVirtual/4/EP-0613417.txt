<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for manufacturing a multilayered wall covering for motor vehicles, in particular private cars, which essentially consists of a decorative part (1) and of a support part (5) and in which the individual layers are essentially linked to each other under the effect of heat. The layers destined to form a wall covering are laid in a predetermined order into a heatable mould, if required with the admixture of a binder. A thermoblocking layer (3) is laid between the more temperature resistant layer(s) which in general form(s) the support part and the less temperature-resistant layer(s), i.e., in general, the decorative layer or the layers that form the decorative layer.

A process for the preparation of a multi-layered wall
lining for motor vehicles, especially passenger cars, essentially

consisting of a decorative part, an intermediate
part and a support part wherein the layers are thermally

bonded to one another, characterized in that the layers

designated for producing said wall lining, namely

a) a non-woven fabric blended with a thermosetting
plastic material as the support part (5);
b) optionally a plastic sheet as an adhesive layer;
c) a layer (3) serving as a thermoblocker;
d) a PE sheet or a PE adhesive as an adhesive layer; and
e) a decorative layer (1);

are inserted in the designated order in a heated mold, and
a temperature of 170°C to 240°C is applied to said support

part (5), and a temperature of 60 °C to 120°C is applied
to said decorative part (1), the treatment time being

from 10 to 250 s.
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that a
temperature of 75 °C to 100°C is applied to said decorative

layer (1), and a temperature of 180°C to 220°C is
applied to said support part (5). 
The process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that a cotton fiber non-woven fabric is used as said thermoblocker

(3).
The process according to claim 3, characterized in that
said cotton fiber non-woven fabric, when prepared, is

blended with a thermoplastic or, in particular, thermosetting
binder, especially phenolic resin, with a uniform

grain size or in powder form.
The process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that a closed-cell foam material, especially a polyethylene,

PU or PP foam, is used as said thermoblocker (3).
The process according to claim 5, characterized in that
open-cell recycling foam off-cuts are used as said foam

material which, prior to being inserted in the mold, are
covered on one or preferably on both sides thereof with a

closed layer formed by a textile web or especially a plastic
sheet.
The process according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the decorative material, being heat-sensitive,

is backed, for example, flame-bonded, with a
closed-cell PP foam as a thermoblocker prior to being inserted

in the mold.
The process according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that an air-impermeable layer is inserted between

the heat-resistant layers and between the thermoblocker
and the heat-sensitive layer when the individual layers of

the wall lining are inserted in the mold.
The process according to claim 8, characterized in that a
thin plastic sheet is inserted as said air-impermeable

layer. 
The process according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterized
in that a release-providing air cushion is produced

between the heat-sensitive layer or layers and the adjacent
interior wall of the mold after the mold has been

closed.
The process according to any of claims 8 to 10 in connection
with any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the

bonding of the individual layers constituting the wall
lining is effected by the action of the pressure prevailing

in the air cushion over the heat-sensitive layer
(decorative layer), said pressure being adjusted to a

value of between about 5 and 30 bar for a period of time
of from about 10 s to about 250 s.
The process according to claim 11, characterized in that
said pressure is maintained for a period of time of about

from 25 s to 180 s.
The process according to claim 11 or 12, characterized in
that said pressure is adjusted to a value of between about

10 and 20 bar.
The process according to any of claims 1 to 13, characterized
in that the heating and bonding of said temperature-resistant

layers is effected by applying a pressure of

>
 10 bar thereto using high-pressure hot steam of 200°C,
especially of from 220 to 300°C.
The process according to any of claims 1 to 14, especially
any of claims 1 to 13 in connection with claim 14, characterized

in that a prepreg is produced for achieving a stable
bonding between the layers constituting the wall lining,

using binders which undergo transition to a thermoplastic
phase, in a premold which, for instance, may be

essentially plane, with heating to reach the thermoplastic 
phase, said prepreg is removed from the mold and taken to

cross-linking temperature by heating the binder in a second
mold, which may be cooled, in particular, and the

molded part is provided with the required folds and/or
trimmed.
The process according to claim 15, characterized in that
the preparation of said folds is performed prior to demolding.
