<ABSTRACT>
Combustible solid material, especially a firelighter, including:     - 10 % to 35 % by weight of nitrocellulose - 30 % to 70 % by weight of a combustible organic product containing vegetable cellulose fibres   - 10 % to 40 % by weight of a plasticiser for nitrocellulose   - 1 % to 15 % by weight of a water-soluble glue.   The invention also relates to a simple, economical and nonpolluting aqueous process for the manufacture of this material, consisting in blending a mixture of nitrocellulose and of a plasticiser for nitrocellulose and then adding the glue and the combustible organic product, and then removing water from the mixture.

<CLAIMS>
A solid, combustible material containing nitrocellulose
and a combustible organic product containing cellulosic

plant fibres, characterised in that it comprises:

10 to 35 wt.% of nitrocellulose
30 to 70 wt.% of a combustible organic product
containing cellulosic plant fibres
10 to 40 wt.% of a nitrocellulose plasticiser
1 to 15 wt.% of a water-soluble glue.
A solid, combustible material according to claim 1,
characterised in that the sum of the percentages of

nitrocellulose, the combustible organic product containing
cellulosic plant fibres, the nitrocellulose plasticiser and

the water-soluble glue is 100.
A solid, combustible material according to claim 1,
characterised in that it is in block form.
A solid, combustible material according to claim 1,
characterised in that said material is a fire lighter.
A solid, combustible material according to claim 1,
characterised in that the nitrogen content of the

nitrocellulose is between 10 and 13.5 wt.%.
A solid, combustible material according to claim 1,
characterised in that the combustible organic product

containing cellulosic plant fibres is selected from the
group consisting of cotton linters, wood, paper and paper

pulp, plant stalks and cobs, cereal straw, fruit husks and
mixtures thereof.
A solid, combustible material according to claim 1,
characterised in that the nitrocellulose plasticiser is an

ester of relatively low volatility. 
A solid, combustible material according to claim 1,
characterised in that the water-soluble glue is selected

from the group consisting of animal glues, starch-derived
glues, glucose molasses, cellulose ether glues and mixtures

thereof.
A solid, combustible material according to claim 1,
characterised in that the organic product containing

cellulosic plant fibres consists of cotton linters and/or
wood flour and/or sawdust, in that the nitrocellulose

plasticiser is triacetin or a mixture of triacetin and an
alkyl phthalate, and in that the water-soluble glue is a

carboxymethyl cellulosic glue.
A process for producing in an aqueous reaction medium a
solid, combustible material according to claim 1,

characterised by implementation of the following successive
stages:


a) compounding of a mixture of nitrocellulose and a
nitrocellulose plasticiser
b) addition to the mixture of a water-soluble glue and
a combustible organic product containing cellulosic plant

fibres, then stirring of the reaction medium
c) elimination of the water from the reaction medium.
A process according to claim 10, characterised in that
the water-soluble glue is introduced before the combustible

organic product containing cellulosic plant fibres.
A process according to claim 10, characterised in that
the amount of water used during stages a) and b) is such

that there is obtained, at the end of stage b), a paste
which is sufficiently viscous to be directly shaped and in

that, after stage b) and before stage c), the paste is
shaped by suitable means.
