<ABSTRACT>
In a process for catalytically cracking a heavy feed in a single riser reactor (10) FCC unit, the catalyst inventory contains 3-10 wt % of a shape selective zeolite, preferably ZSM-5, in the form of a separate additive particle. The addition of such a large quantity of ZSM-5 as a separate additive produces unexpectedly large amounts of C3/C4 olefins. A high catalyst/feed mix temperature in the base of the riser (10) is preferably employed and the mixture quenched, preferably with a recycled heavy naphtha or light cycle oil, at a distance at least 10 % of the length of the riser (10) upstream from the outlet (20) and preferably after at least 1 second of riser (10) cracking.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fluidized catalytic
cracking.In the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC)
process, particulate catalyst circulates between a
cracking reactor and a catalyst regenerator. In the
reactor, hydrocarbon feed contacts a source of hot,
regenerated catalyst, which vaporizes and cracks the
feed at 425°C-600°C, usually 460°C-560°C. The
cracking reaction deposits carbonaceous hydrocarbons
or coke on the catalyst, thereby deactivating the
catalyst. The cracked products are separated from the
coked catalyst, which is stripped of volatiles,
usually with steam, in a catalyst stripper and then
regenerated. The catalyst regenerator burns coke from
the catalyst with oxygen containing gas, usually air,
so as to restore catalyst activity and simultaneously
heat the catalyst to, e.g., 500°C-900°C, usually
600°C-750°C. This heated catalyst is recycled to the
cracking reactor to crack more fresh feed. Flue gas
formed by burning coke in the regenerator may be
treated for removal of particulates and for conversion
of carbon monoxide, after which the flue gas is
normally discharged into the atmosphere.Catalytic cracking has undergone progressive
development since the 1940s. The trend of development
of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process has been
to all riser cracking and the use of zeolite cracking
catalysts. Thus conventional FCC catalysts used in
present day refineries comprise a large pore zeolite
active component, normally zeolite Y, dispersed in a
matrix. In addition, in the last decade there has been
a tendency to add to the cracking catalyst inventory a
small amount of a shape-selective zeolite,
particularly ZSM-5, so as to provide an increase in
gasoline octane and a limited increase in olefin yield 
However, with current FCC regimes these gains in
olefin yield and gasoline octane are only achieved at
the cost of some loss in gasoline yield. As a result,
most refiners operate with only modest amounts of
ZSM-5 (less than 3 wt% zeolite by weight of the total
catalyst composition) so as to achieve an increase in
gasoline octane of about 1 octane number (R+M/2). Thus
there is a perception in the industry that the
benefits of operating with more ZSM-5 (gasoline octane
and limited C3 olefin yield increase) are not worth
the detriments (gasoline yield loss, cost of additive
and reduced C4 olefin production). No operation of
commercial units with large amounts of ZSM-5 additive
has ever been reported.U.S. 3,758,403 discloses the inclusion of 2.5 to
10 wt. % ZSM-5 in a conventional cracking catalyst
