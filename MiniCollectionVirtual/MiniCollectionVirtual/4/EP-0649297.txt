<ABSTRACT>
A tibial implant for a knee prosthesis, including a tibial base (1) accommodating a tibial plate (2), particularly one made of polyethylene. The tibial base (1) has a recess (1a) with a given shape and cross-section for receiving, centring and holding in position an optionally angularly adjustable flanged anchoring and/or stabilising peg (3), relative to the top surface of said base (1).

<CLAIMS>
Tibial implant for a knee prosthesis, comprising a
tibial base (1) provided with an anchoring and/or stabilising

pin (3) and a tibial plate (2) adapted to be arranged on
the base, characterised in that the tibial base (1) has a

hole (1a) of given shape and cross-section suitable for
permitting the engagement, centring and maintenance in

position of the pin, starting from the upper face of the
base (1).
Implant according to claim 1, characterised in that the
hole (1a) is extended by a boss (1a1) protecting from the

lower face (1c) of the tibial base (1), the boss being
shaped to act as an anchoring pin.
Implant according to claim 1, characterised in that the
separate pin (3) has a supported head (3a) suitable for

bearing cooperation in a recess of the hole (1a).
Implant according to claim 1, characterised in that the
hole (1a) has open slots (1a5), the number and orientation

of which correspond to the number and orientation of the
fins (3b) of the pin (3) with a view to their engagement.
Implant according to claim 1, characterised in that the
head (3a) of the pin (3) has means for securing to the hole

(1a).
Implant according to claim 5, characterised in that the
means are constituted by upright slots (3a1) formed starting

from the periphery of the head (3a), with a view to its
diametral expansion under the action of a tightening screw. 
Implant according to claim 2, characterised in that the
boss (1a1) has a frustoconical end (1a2).
Implant according to claim 3, characterized in that the
hole (1a) and the head
 (3a) have a complementary spherical
shape in order to permit the orientation of the pin (3).
Implant according to claim 3, characterised in that the
hole (1a) and the head (3a) are of a generally circular

shape.
Implant according to claim 1, characterised in that the
tibial base (1) has openings (1d) for the passage of securing

screws.
Implant according to claim 1, characterised in that the
tibial base (1) is asymmetrical and has a peripheral flange

(1e) adapted for securing the tibial plate (2) of
polyethylene.
