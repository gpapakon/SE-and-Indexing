<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for producing an image by 
laminating an image-receiving layer to an imaging layer that has 
been image-wise exposed by means of laser radiation. Several proposals have been disclosed so far for obtaining an 
imaging element suited for development according to dry process 
steps with the main purpose of avoiding the use of any processing 
liquid. In addition to the substantial ecological advantages of dry 
processing, the image carrier by itself offers the considerable 
benefit of being suited for daylight processing. However, these 
features are counterbalanced by the relatively low sensitivity and 
the high-power exposing equipment involved. The latent-image formation commonly occurs by introducing selective 
adhesion differences between the density-producing and the image-carrying 
layers by means of an image-wise heat treatment. The 
processing, or visible-image formation, is performed by a sequential 
laminating-delaminating phase of a sheet against the image-carrying 
face of the recorded film. The imaging material, as described e.g. 
in EP 93 201 858, generally comprises a transparent base carrying an 
imaging layer. The imaging layer is covered with a release layer 
and a thermosensitive adhesive layer having a second-order 
transition temperature ranging from 20 to 60 Â°C. The processing occurs by laminating a transfer sheet to the 
thermosensitive adhesive layer under pressure and at increased 
temperature. Such transfer sheet may be any coated or uncoated 
paper type, polyester or any other flat base. The visible image is 
produced by peeling apart again the sandwich of the two above-mentioned 
sheets, i.e. the image-carrying and the transfer sheets. 
During the separation or delamination process the image-wise 
recorded areas of the imaging and release layers are left on the 
transparent base. The non-image areas, i.e. the layer areas that  
 
have not been image-wise recorded, together with the release layer 
remain adhered to the transfer sheet. As a result of the separation 
process two complementary images are generated, i.e. one on the 
transparent base and the other on the transfer sheet. For several reasons : 
1. the highest possible production speed, 2. speed range for allowing lamination and delamination to take 
place at the same speed, 3. speed range for obtaining the optimum image quality 
irrespective of the material applied,  
it is essential to apply a sufficiently high amount of heat to the 
sheets within a relatively short period of
