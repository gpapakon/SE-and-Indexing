<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plate-like composite 
ferrite fine particles, and a process for producing such 
plate-like composite ferrite fine particles. As described, for example, in JP-A-55-86103 (1980), 
ferromagnetic non-acicular particles have recently been 
demanded as a magnetic recording material, and in particular, 
as a perpendicular magnetic recording material. Generally, plate-like ferrite Ba-containing particles 
are known as ferromagnetic non-acicular particles. Also, 
autoclaving an aqueous alkaline suspension containing Ba ions 
and Fe³⁺ using an autoclave as the reaction apparatus 
(hereinafter referred to as the "autoclaving method") is known 
as a process for producing plate-like ferrite. Plate-like ferrite fine particles for magnetic 
recording are required to have as small a particle size as 
possible, to have an appropriate coercive force and a large 
magnetization as the magnetic properties, and to have excellent 
temperature dependence of the coercive force (temperature  
 
stability), such that the coercive force scarcely varies or has 
a tendency to lower with a rise in temperature. This will be 
explained in more detail later. Firstly, the particle size of plate-like ferrite fine 
particles must be as small as possible, as seen from Fig. 3 on 
page 27, lines 23 to 29 in the REPORTS OF TECHNICAL RESEARCHES 
OF THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERS OF 
JAPAN MR 81-11. This figure shows the relationship between the 
particle size of Co-doped acicular maghemite particles and the 
noise level, and it is clear that as the particle size becomes 
smaller, the noise level decreases linearly. This relationship also holds for plate-like ferrite 
Ba-containing particles. Secondly, with respect to the magnetic properties, the 
plate-like ferrite Ba-containing fine particles are generally 
required to have a coercive force of about 2.39 x 10⁴ 
to 1.99 x 10⁵ Am⁻¹ (300 to 2,500 Oe). In order to reduce the 
coercive force of the plate-like ferrite Ba-containing 
particles produced in the autoclaving method to an appropriate 
coercive force, substituting part of the Fe³⁺ in the ferrite by 
Co²⁺, Ti⁴⁺ or the ions of a divalent metal M²⁺ such as Mn and 
Zn has been proposed. The magnetization of plate-like ferrite Ba-containing 
particles must be as large as possible, as described in  
 
JP-A-56-149328 (1981), as follows "... the magneto plumbite 
ferrite which is used as a magnetic recording material is 
required to have the greatest possible saturation 
magnetization...".
