<ABSTRACT>
A parking assistor (1) displays an image of a rear view from
a vehicle (2), which is acquired by a camera (11), on a display (17) located

in a passenger compartment, thus assisting in a parking
procedure. The parking procedure assisted by the parking

assistor (1) is, for example, a parallel parking procedure in
which the rotating direction of the steering wheel (12) must be

switched. An assumed path along which the vehicle (2) is moved

during the parking procedure is determined in accordance with
the steering angle of the steering wheel (12) when the parking

procedure is started. In the parking procedure, the display (17)
indicates a steering information that informs the driver of a

timing at which the rotating direction of the steering wheel (12)
must be switched, in accordance with the assumed path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a parking assistive apparatus (parking assistor) that assist in a parking procedure by displaying an image of a view, as viewed in a direction in which a vehicle moves, on a display located in a passenger compartment.A typical parking assistor, which is described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 1610702 or Japanese Patent Publication No. 2610146, includes a camera and a display. The camera acquires an image of a rear view from a vehicle, and the display shows the acquired image. When a parking procedure is started, the parking assistor assumes a path along which the vehicle is moved during the procedure in accordance with the steering angle of the steering wheel. The assumed path appears on the display, in addition to the image of the rear view from the vehicle. The parking procedure is thus continued with the aid of the image on the display. This makes it easy for the driver to complete the parking procedure.For example, if the vehicle is parked in a space between a pair of vehicles that are parked along a road shoulder, the steering wheel of the vehicle is first rotated in one direction such that the vehicle is reversed while turning in the corresponding direction. Subsequently, the steering wheel is rotated in the other direction such that the vehicle is reversed while turning in the corresponding direction. However, the aforementioned parking assistor does not inform the driver of an optimal timing at which the rotating direction of the steering wheel should be switched. Accordingly, the parking assistor is not sufficiently assistive in the parking procedure in which the rotating direction of the steering wheel must be switched. As a result, the parking procedure is not sufficiently simplified for the driver.Furthermore, document FR-A-2 785 383 discloses a method of and an apparatus for assisting a driver for parking a vehicle in a parking lot. The parking lot is basically arranged between different cars or objects of obstruction arranged on the road side. The objects of obstruction which determine the available parking space are detected with respect to a start position of the vehicle and a parking trajectory is calculated to be taken by the vehicle in order to arrive at a final parking position between the other vehicles or objects. The calculated trajectory is a function of parking space dimensions, vehicle dimensions, the vehicle start position and the braking and steering characteristics of the vehicle. The trajectory is divided into various portions
