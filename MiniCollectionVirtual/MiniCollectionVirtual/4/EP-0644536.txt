<ABSTRACT>
According to an automatic attitude correcting system of 
this invention, correction signals which are used to reduce 

control errors through a focus control, a tracking control, a 
tilt control, etc. are determined by measuring the amplitude 

of an RF reproduction signal reproduced from an optical disc 
at a predetermined area. For setting a correction signal value 

to be supplied to an attitude control mechanism such as an attitude 
control mechanism, a scanning signal whose signal level 

varies with time variation is supplied to a control mechanism 
driving circuit. The scanning signal varies in level at every 

one-revolution of the optical disc, and the amplitude of the 
RF reproduction signal is outputted from the optical head at 

every one-revolution of the optical disc, and measured at a 
predetermined angle for each level of the scanning signal. The 

maximum value is detected on the basis of the plural amplitude 
values thus measured, and the scanning signal value providing 

the maximum value is determined as a correction signal to be 
used in a reproducing operation. Therefore, in the reproducing 

operation, the control error of the control mechanism is excellently 
suppressed with the correction signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic attitude correcting
system for use in an optical disc device for reproducing
information from an optical disc.In a reproducing operation of an optical disc on which
information tracks are spirally or concentrically formed, if
recording density of the optical disc is low, no problem would
occur to the reproduction even when the control accuracy of
control mechanisms containing an optical system including an
optical head in its focus control, tracking control, tilt control,
etc. is relatively low, and further no critical problem
would occur even when an RF reproduction signal outputted from
the optical head is deteriorated. The deterioration of the RF
reproduction signal means deterioration in frequency characteristics,
SN ratio, jitter, symmetry of waveforms, and the
like.If the recording density is high, the control accuracy of
the control mechanisms is required to be considerably high,
and the deterioration of the RF reproduction signal is
required to be limited. However, actually, if the positional
relationship between the optical disc and the optical head for 
reading the recorded information from the optical disc is not
accurately kept, the RF reproduction signal outputted from the
optical disc is degraded, so that high precision control
cannot be performed.For example, when tracking control is conducted, an
objective lens of the optical head is shifted (displaced) in a
radial direction of the optical disc (this shift is called
"lens shift"), and during this lens shift, the optical axis of
a laser beam emitted from a laser source toward a disc surface
is not necessarily aligned with the center of the lens, and
this error of alignment causes false signals to be generated
and superposed on a focus error signal representing an out-of-focus
amount of the objective lens, and on a tracking error
signal representing the deviation of the laser beam from the
center of a track, etc., so that no high-precision control can
be performed.Further, it is preferable that the optical axis of the
laser beam is perpendicular to the surface of the optical
disc. However, actually, when loading accuracy of the optical
disc into an optical disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus
is low or when the surface of the optical disc has a
runout, the optical disc is inclined (no longer perpendicular)
to the optical axis of the laser beam (hereinafter referred to
as "tilt"), and thus false signals are generated and are
liable to be superposed on the focus error signal, the
tracking error
