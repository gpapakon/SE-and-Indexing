<ABSTRACT>
Contaminated groundwater is treated in-situ, by funnelling the water through a gate or gates (23) in a watertight in-ground wall (18). Treatment material in the gate (23) breaks down the contaminant, or otherwise removes the contaminant from the flowing water. A removable caisson is first driven into the ground, excavated, and then a receptacle, for the treatment material, is lowered into the hollow interior.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for treating contaminated 
groundwater. One of the difficulties in conventional systems for treating 
contaminated groundwater arises from the fact that taking water 
out of the ground for treatment is expensive. From the cost 
point of view, it is highly desirable that the groundwater be 
treated in-situ, ie while remaining in the ground. It has been proposed to place treatment material in the ground, 
the material being inserted into a trench which has been 
excavated in the path of a plume of contaminant. The nature of 
the treatment material of course depends on the nature of the 
contaminant. An example is described in WO-91/08176, published 
13 Jun 91, in which the contaminant is an halogenated 
hydrocarbon, and the treatment material is iron. The iron is in 
the form of iron filings, which are placed in a trench excavated 
down into the material of the aquifer in the path of the 
velocity of the halogenated hydrocarbon contaminant plume. When groundwater water is treated in-situ or in-ground, many of 
the expenses of above-ground treatment, such as the expense of 
disposing of the treated water, can be avoided. Inexpensive 
though in-ground treatement usually is, however, still, in 
practice, it can be difficult and expensive actually to provide 
a trench of the required depth and extent in the material of the 
aquifer. Aquifer materials often include large proportions of sand and 
gravel. One of the difficulties in providing a trench lies in 
the fact that such materials have little structural cohesion. 
In fact, sand/gravel material is especially unable to support 
itself when saturated with groundwater, ie below the water 
table, which is where an in-situ treatment system is 
particularly required to operate. It may be regarded that  
 
saturated sand/gravel aquifer material, from the standpoint of 
excavating a trench, has hardly any more ability to support 
itself than if it were a liquid. One conventional manner for providing trenches in an aquifer 
material is to insert a pair of barriers, made of sheet metal, 
and inserted by pile-driving, down into the material of the 
aquifer. The two barriers are disposed in a spaced, parallel 
relationship. After the barriers are in place, the aquifer 
material is then extracted from between the barriers. Treatment 
material (eg iron filings) is inserted between the barriers, and 
replaces the sand/gravel that has been extracted. The two 
barriers are removed once the treatment material is in place. The treatment

System for in-situ treatment of contaminated 
groundwater in an aquifer, wherein: 


the system is of the kind in which the contaminated groundwater 
moves through the aquifer due to in-ground hydraulic-head 

gradients; 
the system includes a barrier or wall that extends down into the 
ground, the wall being placed in the path of the in-ground 

movement of the contaminated groundwater, the wall dividing 
an upstream portion of the aquifer from a downstream portion 

of the aquifer; 
the wall is watertight, in the sense of being effective to 
substantially prevent the passage of groundwater through the 

wall; 
the system includes at least one gap or gate in the wall; 
the system includes a body of treatment material; 
the body of treatment material is porous and permeable to the 
extent that groundwater can pass through the treatment 

material; 
the treatment material is of such a chemical composition, in 
relation to the nature of the contaminant, that the 

contaminant in the water undergoes a chemical change, upon 
the water being passed through the treatment material; 
the body is located in the ground, in the gate, and is so 
arranged that groundwater can pass from the upstream portion 

of the aquifer to the downstream portion of the aquifer 
through the treatment material; 
the system includes a gate sealing means which is effective to 
prevent the passage of groundwater between the wall and the 

body of treatment material in the gate, whereby groundwater 
cannot pass from the upstream portion of the aquifer to the 

downstream portion of the aquifer except through the 
treatment material; 
the arrangement and dimensions of the gate, the body of treatment 
5 material, and the sealing means are such, in relation to the 

velocity of flow of the groundwater, that even the shortest 
path through the treatment material from the upstream 

portion of the aquifer to the downstream portion of the  
 

aquifer is long enough to ensure a residence period of the 
contaminated water within the body of treatment material of 

sufficient time as to ensure the effective treatment of the 
contaminant; 
the flow area of the gate, or, where the barrier contains more 
than one gate, the aggregate flow areas of all the gates, 

being the area presented to the upstream portion of the 
aquifer through which water can pass to the downstream 

portion of the aquifer, is substantially less than the area 
of the wall presented to the upstream portion of the 

aquifer; 
whereby the groundwater, in flowing from the upstream portion of 
the aquifer to the downstream portion of the aquifer, is 

funnelled through the gate or gates.

the system is extensive enough to contain all the 

contaminated groundwater.

like slurry material as the soil is removed from the trench, 
whereby the trench became filled with slurry, and the slurry

a downstream screen, through which a downstream sector of the 
body of treatment material lies in groundwater-communication 

with the downstream portion of the aquifer; 
and the gate sealing means comprises left and right sealing

then withdrawing the caisson from the ground. 
System of claim 10, wherein the caisson was so formed 
that the upstream sector, the downstream sector, and the 

intercalated left and right side sectors, were in separate 
pieces, and the separate pieces were capable of being driven 

into the ground, and of being withdrawn from the ground,
