<ABSTRACT>
A device for mounting a pump of an auxiliary hydraulic 
circuit in a commercial vehicle. The device serves for 

mounting a pump (16) in the front portion of a vehicle with an 
internal combustion engine arranged longitudinally and with 

a cooling fan (8) which is arranged eccentrically relative to 
the engine shaft. 
The device comprises a mounting (14) fixed to the chassis 
of the vehicle for supporting the pump (16) at a distance 

from the axis of the fan greater than the maximum radius 
thereof. The pump is driven by a belt transmission (40) 

including a ring gear (42) fixed to a pulley (1) connected to 
the engine shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to commercial vehicles having 
auxiliary hydraulic circuits for operating hydraulic power 
actuators such as, for example, jacks and the like. The invention has been developed with particular reference 
to vehicles equipped for the collection, compacting and 
discharge of refuse and to vehicles for washing and/or 
disinfecting refuse-collection containers. In this field, it is well-known to provide the vehicle with 
hydraulic cylinders which control various operative 
functions, in particular, the lifting and tipping of the 
refuse-collection containers, the compacting of the refuse 
collected in the load opening of the vehicle, and the 
discharge of the mass of refuse. The hydraulic cylinders 
are operated by a pump connected in an auxiliary hydraulic 
circuit. The present invention relates specifically to a device for 
mounting such a pump in a commercial vehicle. Basically, there are two ways of connecting the pump to the 
engine of the vehicle. A first, known solution provides for the pump to be 
connected to a power take-off connected to the driven shaft 
or to the driving shaft of the gearbox. This solution has 
been found expensive because of the engagement mechanisms 
necessary to take the drive from one of the gear shafts. 
This solution also needs complex and expensive 
synchronization devices or safety mechanisms which allow  
 
the power take-off to operate only when the clutch is 
disengaged. A solution which is usually preferred for reasons of cost 
provides for the pump to be connected directly to the 
engine shaft. With engines arranged longitudinally, the 
front end of the engine shaft projects from the engine 
block and carries a cooling fan facing the vehicle's 
radiator. If the cooling fan is coaxial with the engine 
shaft, the solution usually adopted for the mounting of the 
pump provides for the pump shaft to be fixed directly to 
the engine shaft by means of a shaft coaxial with the fan 
and extending through the radiator of the vehicle. This solution cannot be used when the cooling fan is 
arranged eccentrically relative to the engine shaft and is 
connected thereto by means of a belt transmission. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
particularly simple and cheap solution which enables the 
pump to be connected to the front end of the engine shaft 
in a vehicle with an engine arranged longitudinally and 
with a cooling fan which is eccentric relative to the 
engine shaft. According to the present invention, this object is achieved

<CLAIMS>
A device for mounting a pump (16) of an auxiliary 
hydraulic circuit in a commercial vehicle having an 

internal combustion engine arranged longitudinally with a 
pulley (1) keyed to the engine shaft which drives, by means 

of a belt transmission, a cooling fan which is eccentric 
relative to the engine shaft, characterized in that it 

comprises a mounting (14) fixed to the chassis of the 
vehicle (10) for supporting the pump (16) at a distance 

from the axis of the fan greater than the maximum radius 
thereof, and a toothed-belt transmission (40) interposed 

between the drive shaft (36) of the pump (16) and a ring 
gear (42) which is fixed to the pulley (1), the toothed 

belt (40) cooperating with a resilient tensioner (46). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
mounting (14) comprises a first portion (18) which is fixed 

relative to the chassis (10) and a second portion (20) 
which is fixed relative to the body of the pump (16), the 

two portions (18, 20) being movable relative to one other 
and being interconnected by restraining means (34) which can 

clamp the two portions (18, 20) in a predetermined relative 
position. 
A device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
first and second portions of the mounting (14) have 

respective plates (18, 22) which face each other and have 
respective slots (30, 32) which extend substantially at 90Â° 

to each other, and in which clamping screws (34) engage.
