<ABSTRACT>
A braking system calculates the duration of the pressure reduction signal. The wheel acceleration (or reacceleration) and the slippage in the unstable area of the wheel are determined and related to predetermined values. The reduction time of the new regulation cycle is calculated so that the wheel reacceleration that follows the pressure reduction corresponds to a previously calculated value. This signal duration is corrected in order to keep small the amplitude of the pressure modulation.

wheels of a vehicle, consisting of sensors (1, 2) for 

determining the behaviour of the wheel motion, an evaluation 

circuit (3) for processing the sensor signals and 
for generating brake pressure control signals (TAV), and 

a brake pressure control unit (4, 5) which is fed the
