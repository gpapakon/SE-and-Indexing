<ABSTRACT>
A turbine section having a seal cavity with effectively continuous flow surfaces is disclosed. Various construction details are developed which disclose a fluid cooled stator assembly having a plurality of ejectors for flowing cooling fluid into the seal cavity. In one embodiment, the ejectors (114) include a wall (132) which have circumferentially spaced mating edges (134, 136) arranged in a cascade type configuration. The arrangement of the walls provides an effectively continuous flow surface for the radially flowing annulus of cooling fluid within a seal cavity (108). In an alternate embodiment, an opening (152) between adjacent mating edges (154, 156) provides access to mechanical fasteners (162) which retain a sealing shroud (164) to a stator assembly (150).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas turbine engines 
and, more particularly, to turbine stator assemblies. A typical gas turbine engine has a compressor 
section, a combustion section and a turbine section. 
The gas turbine engine includes an annular flowpath 
for conducting working fluid sequentially through the 
compressor, combustor, and turbine sections. The 
compressor has an array of rotating blades and non-rotating 
stator vanes. The rotating blades compress 
the working fluid and thereby add momentum to the 
working fluid. The non-rotating stator vanes orient 
the flow of working fluid for optimum transfer of 
energy. Fuel is then added to the compressed working 
fluid in the combustion section. The mixture of fuel 
and working fluid is burned in a combustion process 
which adds energy to the working fluid. The hot 
working fluid is then expanded through the turbine 
section. The turbine section includes another array 
of rotating blades and non-rotating stator vanes. 
The interaction of the working fluid and the turbine 
blades transfers energy to the turbine blades. The 
turbine blades are connected to a rotating shaft 
which is connected to the compressor blades. In this 
way the energy which is transferred from the working 
fluid to the turbine blades is used to compress  
 
incoming working fluid in the compressor. The combustion process raises the temperature of 
the working fluid in direct proportion to the energy 
added. The temperature of the working fluid, and 
thereby the amount of energy which can be added, is 
limited by the temperature characteristics of the 
materials used in the turbine section. During 
operation, rotational forces introduce significant 
stresses on rotating structure within the turbine 
section. Increases in temperature reduce the 
allowable stress and degrade the structural integrity 
of turbine materials. Therefore, structure within 
the turbine section must be maintained within 
acceptable temperature levels. This is especially 
critical for the first stages of the turbine section 
which encounter working fluid having the highest 
temperature. Structure of particular importance in the 
turbine section is the rotating seals between the 
inner diameter of the stator vane assembly and a seal 
runner extending axially between rotor assemblies. 
Rotating seals minimize the amount of working fluid 
which bypasses the blades and vanes, and thereby 
maximizes the interaction between the working fluid 
and the airfoil portions of the blades and vanes. A
