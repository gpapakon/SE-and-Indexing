<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of silica xerogel by hydrolysis and polycondensation of a tetraalkoxysilane to form an alcogel which is a silica skeleton surrounded by an aqueous methanol, whereafter the aqueous methanol is removed by evaporation. The alcogel formed is brought in contact with a solution of tetraalkoxysilane, the contact is maintained at or above room temperature to strengthen the silica skeleton, whereafter the gel is dried slowly at or above room temperature and at about atmospheric pressure. Before the alcogel is brought in contact with the solution of tetraalkoxylsilane it may be washed with a solution (e.g. aqueous methanol) to change the composition of the aqueous alcohol surrounding the silica skeleton or to change the functional groups on the surface of the alcogel.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Process for the preparation of a silica aerogel-like material.This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a material similar to silica aerogel. Silica aerogel is a porous material of a very low density and it contains up to 99% of air. The type of silica aerogel prepared according to the present invention is normally called silica xerogel. Due its high porosity, the material has excellent heat insulating properties, and since the pore size of the material is smaller than the wave length of visible light, it is also transparent. Typical properties of silica aerogel are as follows:Density: 70 - 250 kg/m3Refractive index: 1.02 - 1.05 Thermal conductivity in air: 0.021 /mK at 20°CThermal conductivity in vacuum: 0.008 W/mK at 20°CParticle size: 4 - 7 nmPore size: 10 - 20 nmTransmittance 88% for 10 mm thicknessSilica aerogel has an insulating property which is approximately twice as good as that of rockwool, and since it is also transparent, it may be used as insulation in windows.Due to its porosity silica xerogel/aerogel has also a very high capacity for sucking up liquid and may also be used as starting material for composite materials and carrier for catalyst and liquids, e.g. electrolytes.Originally, sodium silicate-hydrate was used as starting material for the preparation of silica aerogel, and in a hydrogen chloride catalysed reaction between the silicate and water an aquagel was formed. However, this preparation route is very time-consuming since the aquagel has to be washed with alcohol before the drying step may take place. The drying process is necessary to remove preferably all liguid, leaving only the desired silica network. 

 More recently tetramethoxysilane, Si(OCH3)4, TMOS, has also been used as starting material for the preparation of silica aerogel. TMOS is a suitable starting material since it is easy to handle, easy to prepare in pure form and easy to hydrolyse. However, it is toxic and expensive. The alcogel formation takes place by a direct acid- and/or base-catalysed hydrolysis of TMOS in a so-called sol-gel technology. The alcogel formed is a silica skeleton surrounded by aqeous methanol. The problem which then arises is to remove the aqueous methanol from the silica skeleton to obtain the- aerogel.In order to prepare the desired aerogel, it is as mentioned above, necessary to remove the liquid surrounding the silica skeleton, and this may be done by eliminating or at least reducing the capillary forces working in the alcogel when the liquid front withdraws, or the
