<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process, which can be carried out continuously, for disintegrating cell material in the form of dispersions or suspensions in water for the purpose of obtaining cell constituents. The invention avoids the use of solid ultrasonication activators and the establishment of a particular geometric form for the acoustic irradiation container by particular parameters with regard to the synotrode angle, the depth of immersion of the synotrode, the ratio of extent of immersion of the synotrode to the acoustic irradiation volume and the ratio of extent of immersion of the synotrode to the solide matter content of the medium to be sonicated. In this process, contents of solid matter within the range from 0.5 to 65 % by weight can be used in the medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
Cell constituents, such as enzymes, proteins,
vitamins and substances having an antimethodic inflammation-inhibiting
or cytostatic effect, are required, for
example, in medical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic
applications.DE-C-32 26 016 describes an arrangement with an
extrusion homogenizer in which the cells are destroyed by
a high pressure gradient and cavitation and turbulence
effects in a narrow aperture.A fundamental disadvantage of these processes and
arrangements is that they are very time-consuming and the
degree of disintegration they achieve is unsatisfactory.It is also disadvantageous that in many cases
only long-lasting organic compounds can be dealt with. In
addition to this, the abovementioned mechanical processes
are very energy-consuming and give rise to high installation
and running costs, and their efficiency for use with
relatively susceptible substances remains limited.Of the possible disintegration methods in which
ultrasonication devices are used, only a few are known
from the literature and from the catalogues of manufacturing
companies which are additionally limited to
laboratory use. These processes are characterized by the
known arrangement of an ultrasonication device consisting
of an HP generator, an electromechanical converter with
an operating tool (sonotrode) and a multiplicity of
acoustic irradiation vessels which are mostly open and
which in addition can be coolable and permit continuous
charging with the medium.Special acoustic irradiation devices (cells) are
also known which are coupled directly to an 
electromechanical ultrasonication converter (cf., for
example, DE-C-20 27 533). It is disadvantageous that, as
a result of the necessary configuration as a wavelength-dependent
resonator element, no advantageous
constructional design of the acoustic irradiation volume
is possible and cooling must be dispensed with.Many forms of sonotrode are known from industrial
descriptions of inventions which are suitable for acoustic
irradiation. A crucial disadvantage of these processes
and arrangements is the unsatisfactory degree of
disintegration achieved, amounting to at most 60%,
occasioned by the fact that no agents favouring the
ultrasonication effect are employed and that no allowance
is made for the necessary constructional design of an
acoustic irradiation volume.In order, as far as possible, to remedy these
deficiencies, DD 284 131 recommends the concomitant use
of so-called ultrasonication activators, for example in
the form of bodies consisting of a cavitation-resistant
and
