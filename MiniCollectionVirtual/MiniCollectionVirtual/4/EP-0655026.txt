<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a modular bit holder (10) which stores and displays a single bit (16), and can be linked with other such bit holders (10) to form a variable set. A bit (16) is inserted in one end (40) of the holder (10), and is held in place by a flange. To remove the bit (16), a second bit (16) is forced into the holder (10), displacing the first bit (16) to a holding position from which it can be removed. Each holder (10) has means (42, 45) along either side of it to removably attach it in side-by-side fashion to another similar holder (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to holders and packaging 
for elongated objects such as drill bits, screwdriver bits 
and the like. Typically tool bits, such as power drill bits, 
are sold in sets of 8 to 12 bits of sequential sizes, 
carried in a plastic carrying case which also functions to 
store the bits at the owner's workbench. A problem with 
such an approach to the marketing of bits is that it 
restricts the purchaser's flexibility in the selection and 
storing of various bit sizes. For example, a purchaser will 
be forced to acquire separately a size of bit not included 
in the pre-packaged selection and will be unable to store 
the bit in the plastic package which contains the initial 
set. Other tool bits are also amenable to sale and 
storage in sets, such as screwdriver bits for power drivers 
or for multiple-bit screwdrivers, such as those sold 
under the trade-mark PIC-QUICtm which is disclosed in US-A-4,924,733. 
Currently there is no convenient 
means for vending and storing such bits in variable 
sets.  
 EP-A-0 362 124 discloses a modular tool holder which 
stores and displays a single tool having a round or 
tapered shank, and can be linked with other such tool 
holders to form a variable tool holding set. Each of the 
modular tool holders has a connection means along either 
side of it to removably secure it in side-by-side fashion 
to another similar holder so that modules may be 
assembled by a nesting motion or disassembled. However 
in EP-A-0 362 124, each tool is held in an adjustable 
opening having tapered sides which grip the tool shank 
like a chuck. Thus one end of the shank remains exposed 
outside of the opening to allow the tool to be removed, 
and like a chuck the tool is removed from the same 
direction from which it was inserted into the holder.  
 There is therefore a need for a convenient means 
for vending and storing tool bits singly or in 
variable sets. The present invention provides an improved modular 
bit holder adapted for use as a storage container in the 
retail sale of bits singly or in variable sets, said 
modular bit holder ensuring the protection or tool bits 
during transport and vending without restricting the 
purchaser's flexibility in the selection and storing of 
various bit sizes.  
 The present invention discloses a storage container for a 
tool bit which stores and displays a single bit, and can be 
linked with other such storage containers to form a variable set. 
A bit is inserted in one end of the container, and is held 
temporarily in place by a

<CLAIMS>
A storage container (10) for a tool bit (16), said, 
tool bit having a length L and diameter D, comprising: 


a) a hollow body (12) having front, rear and side 
walls (15, 13, 44, 46) and a central chamber (14) 

open at either end, having a diameter greater than D 
and a length greater than L and extending through 

the length of said body (12) for receiving said tool 
bit (16): 
b) first means (30) positioned in said chamber (14) 
for releasably retaining said tool bit (16) in a 

first position in said chamber adjacent a first end 
thereof; 
c) second means (38) for releasably retaining said 
tool bit (16) in a second position in said chamber 

(14) at a distance greater than L from said first 
end; and 
d) means (42, 45) provided on each of said side 
walls (44, 46) for releasably securing each of said 

side walls (44, 46) to the corresponding side walls 
(44, 46) of complementary containers (10). 
The container (10) of claim 1 wherein said tool bit 
(16) has a head and said front wall (15) is provided with 

an opening (20) located so as to permit the viewing of 
the head of said bit (16) when said bit is in said first 

position. 
The container of claim 1 wherein said first and 
second means for releasably retaining each comprises a 

movable member (30, 38) biassed to protrude into the interior 
of said chamber (14) and thereby make frictional contact 

with a tool bit (16) located in said chamber. 
The container of claim 1 wherein each said movable  
 

member (30, 38) comprises an elongated flap flexibly joining 
said hollow body at one end thereof and free to move at 

the other end thereof. 
The container of claim 1 wherein each said movable 
member (30, 38) further comprises a raised protrusion (32, 39) on 

the freely moving end of said elongated flap for contacting 
said tool bit. 
The container of claim 1 wherein said means for 
releasably securing a second container comprises a tenon 

(42) along one side (44) of said body (12) and a complementary 
mortise (45) along the other side (46) of said 

body (12). 
The container of claim 1 further comprising means 
(22) for hanging said body from a nail, hook or peg.
