Seed drill with a supply container and with a metering shaft (6), on which metering wheels (7) or metering rollers (8) having metering bosses (9) are arranged. In order to simplify the design of the metering members substantially and make it less expensive, provision is made for arranging the metering wheels (7) and/or metering rollers (8) in a space enclosing the metering wheels (7) and/or metering roller (8) at least downwards and on the side, facing away from the supply-container space, of walls (19) arranged approximately angularly relative to one another, and for arranging vertical slots (20) in the upright wall (19) of the walls (19) arranged angularly relative to one another, and for the metering bosses (9) to engage into these slots (20).
