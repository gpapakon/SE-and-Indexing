<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a thickness gauge 
for moving sheet material for lightweight paper, and 
more particularly for measuring the caliber of such 
paper. In the measurement of the caliper of lightweight paper, 
care must be taken to avoid marking or ripping the 
paper. This is especially critical when slight flaws 
are present in the sheet material which must be 
accommodated by the thickness gauge. In addition to 
being tolerant to flaws, the measuring gauge or 
thickness gauge should be tolerant to ripples and 
curvatures in the paper, especially in the cross-direction. 
Lastly, a thickness gauge should 
accommodate the so-called passline of the moving paper 
which may vary as much as one-half inch. One type of thickness gauge which meets several of the 
above requirements is shown in patent 4,929,895 in the 
name of Pekka M. Typpo, the present inventor and 
assigned to the present assignee. This patent utilizes 
a pair of flexibly mounted air bearings. However, it 
is still desirable to provide further improvements in 
a thickness gauge so that lighter papers can be  
 
Measured with greater accommodation of various flaws, 
ripples and curvatures of the paper. Reference should also be made to US-A-3828248 which 
addresses the problem of measurement of the thickness of 
fine papers which are easily torn. The apparatus makes use 
of opposing rubber diaphragms on which are mounted magnetic 
circuit means which include a ferrite core and an inductive 
coil whose inductance is affected by the gap caused by the 
paper which is part of the magnetic flux path. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide an improve thickness gauge for moving sheet 
material. In accordance with the above object, there is provided a 
thickness gauge for moving sheet material having first and 
second magnetic circuit means juxtaposed on opposite sides 
of the sheet and indicative of its thickness. The gauge 
comprises upper and lower means on opposite sides of the 
sheet for flexibly carrying the first and second magnetic 
circuit means. The upper and lower means each includes 
opposed outer bearing means having a relatively rigid ring 
portion and include means for flexibly causing the outer 
bearing means to move toward engagement with the sheet and 
toward each other. One of the upper and lower means 
includes a relatively rigid central portion connected to 
the ring portion and carrying the first magnetic circuit 
means. The other of the upper and lower means has a 
relatively rigid central

<CLAIMS>
A thickness gauge for moving sheet material (10) 
having first (26, 27, 28) and second (29) magnetic 

circuit means juxtaposed on opposite sides of said 
sheet and indicative of the thickness of said sheet 

(10) with upper and lower means (12, 22a; 13, 22b) on 
the opposition sides of the sheet for flexibly carrying 

said first and second magnetic circuit means (26-29) 
said upper and lower means each including opposed outer 

bearing means having a relatively rigid ring portion 
(21a, 21b) and including means (59, 61) for flexibly 

causing said outer bearing means to move toward 
engagement with said sheet (10) and toward each other, 

characterized in that one (13, 22b) of said upper and 
lower means having a relatively rigid central portion 

(29) carrying said second magnetic circuit means (29) 
and coupled by elongated strap means (31) to said outer 

bearing means (21a) with said strap means at a 
substantially fixed angle, said strap means (31) 

allowing vertical movement of said magnetic circuit 
means (29) perpendicular to said sheet (10) but with 

negligible movement parallel to said sheet and 
including resilient means (43, 73) for pushing said 

rigid central portion of said second magnetic circuit 
means (29) into contact with said sheet (10). 
A thickness gauge as in claim 1 where said 
resilient means (43, 73) includes a resilient sheet  

 
(49) physically coupled to said rigid central portion 

(29), such resilient sheet (49) being under a 
predetermined air pressure. 
A thickness gauge as in claim 2 where said 
resilient means includes intermediate sponge means (51) 

coupling said rigid central portion (29) to said 
resilient sheet (49). 
A thickness gauge as in claim 1 wherein said outer 
bearing means (21a, 21b) of at least one of said upper 

and lower means (12, 22a; 13, 22b) includes a plurality 
of spaced air exits (24) to provide an air bearing 

between such ring (21a, 21b) and said sheet (10). 
A thickness gauge as in claim 4 wherein said 
resilient means includes a resilient sheet (49) under 

air pressure physically connected to said rigid central 
portion (29) and where said air pressure used for said 

resilient sheet (49) is greater than the air pressure 
at said air exits (24) whereby said central portion 

(29) tends to move into engagement with said moving 
sheet (10). 
A thickness gauge as in claim 1 wherein said 
resilient means includes a resilient sheet (49) 

physically connected to said rigid central portion (29) 
under air pressure, the resilient sheet (49) being 

placed in an actuator cavity (42) pressurized at said 
air pressure, the resilient sheet closing a large 

aperture (47) in said cavity (42), and said air  
 

pressure forcing said sheet (49) and the rigid central 
portion (29) towards the moving sheet and including 

air escape apertures (51) in said cavity (42) for 
providing a constant contact force with said sheet 

independent of said outer bearing means (21a). 
A thickness gauge as in claim 1 wherein said strap 
means (31) is constructed of relatively nonstretchable 

and temperature resistant aramid material. 
A thickness gauge as in claim 1 where said strap 
means (31) is elongated in the direction of movement 

(11) of the moving sheet material (10).
