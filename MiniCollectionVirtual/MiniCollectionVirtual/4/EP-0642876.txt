<ABSTRACT>
A joint and a laminate including a nickel-titanium 
alloy such as Nitinol and a method for preparing the 

surface of a nickel-titanium alloy member for bonding 
solder material and, electively, another similar or 

dissimilar member thereto. The method includes applying a 
halogen containing flux to the titanium oxide coated 

surface of a nickel-titanium alloy member and heating the 
flux to its activation temperature. The flux removes and 

suspends the titanium oxide therein and deposits a metal 
from the halogen containing flux on the oxidation free 

surface. The activated flux also coats the member surface 
for protection from further oxidation. A bonding material 

such as a tin-silver solder is flowed onto the tinned 
surface to displace the activated flux. Electively, 

another member is applied to the molten solder to form a 
joint between the two members. The residual flux is 

cleaned from the joint to prevent further deterioration of 
the base metal. The solder joint includes the base nickel-titanium 

alloy metal, the metal from the halogen containing 
flux, and the solder material. Electively, any other 

member may be applied to this joint in the molten state to 
form a metallic bond therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a joint, a laminate, and a method of
preparing the surface of a
nickel-titanium alloy member for bonding to another layer of metal and, electively,
to similar or dissimilar members.A problem in bonding to nickel-titanium alloys such as Nitinol is that as
the alloy is heated, desirable properties such as shape memory or superelasticity are
commonly destroyed or severely degraded as the alloy is heated through its
annealing temperature range. The loss of these desirable properties is also a function
of the size and shape of the alloy member, as well as the time 
period and temperature of the applied heat. In medical
applications, nickel-titanium alloy wires are commonly used
to form baskets, filters, and the like that are
percutaneously introduced into the patient with an
introducer catheter or sheath. When the nickel-titanium
wire is welded or brazed, the shape memory or superelastic
properties are typically destroyed or severely degraded.
As a result, other attachment means are utilized such as a
short length of stainless steel cannula being typically
crimped to attach a nickel-titanium wire to itself or
another device component, which undesirably stiffens the
overall device and contributes to its overall bulk.As suggested, one prior art technique for bonding
two or more metallic members together is welding, in which
the members are heated to their melting points and
deformed. The annealing temperature of nickel-titanium
alloys such as Nitinol ranges from 177 to 510°C (350 degrees to 950
degrees Fahrenheit) depending on the time period that a
particular temperature is applied. Since the annealing
temperature range is well below the typical 1288°C (2350 degree
Fahrenheit) melting temperature of Nitinol, welding nickel-titanium
alloy wires clearly destroys the desirable shape
memory and superelastic properties of the alloy
particularly at the weld joint.Another prior art technique for bonding two or more
metallic members is brazing, in which a bonding material is
typically heated above 425 degrees Celsius (797 degrees
Fahrenheit) but below the melting temperature of the
metallic members. However, brazing normally exceeds the
annealing temperatures of nickel-titanium alloys, and as a
result, desirable shape memory and superelastic properties
are, again, typically destroyed or severely degraded.Another bonding technique that utilizes even lower
temperatures is soldering. Soldering utilizes a solder
material typically having a melting point below 425 degrees
Celsius. The

A method of preparing a surface of a nickel-titanium alloy member for
bonding another metal thereto, the method comprising the steps of applying to the

member a flux having an activation temperature below a predetermined annealing
temperature of the alloy member, the flux having a composition suitable for removing a

contaminant from the member surface, and for further removing portions of titanium
from the member surface by substitution thereof by metal or metals from the flux, and

removing with the flux the contaminant and the substituted titanium from the member
surface, wherein the flux comprises: a carrier selected from abietic acid, ethylene

diamine glutamic acid, lactic acid, phthalic acid, hydrazine hydrobromide oleic acid,
stearic acid, urea, and organic amines such as ethanol amine;

a non-metallic halogen compound selected from
anline hydrochloride,

glutamic hydrochloride, bromide derivatives of palmitic acid, hydrazine hydrochloride
or hydrobromide, and an eutectic mixture selected from CsF-ZrF
