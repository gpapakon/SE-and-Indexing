<ABSTRACT>
Macrocyclic polyetherimide oligomer 
compositions are prepared by the reaction of an alkali metal 

salt of a dihydroxyaromatic compound, preferably of 
bisphenol A, with a substituted bis-phthalimide, typically a 

chloro-, fluoro- or nitro-substituted o- or m-phenylene bisphthalimide. 
The reaction takes place in a substantially 

non-polar solvent such as o-dichlorobenzene and at 
temperatures in the range of about 180-225°C in the 

presence of a phase transfer catalyst which is stable at 
such temperatures, such as a guanidinium salt. The 

concentration of phase transfer catalyst is such as to 
maintain the alkali metal salt at high dilution in the 

solvent, and the substituted bis-phthalimide is preferably 
also maintained at high dilution by portionwise addition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of
macrocyclic oligomer compositions, and more particularly
to the preparation of macrocyclic polyetherimide oligomers.US-A-3787364 discloses a method for
preparing polyetherimides by the reaction of a
bis(chlorophthalimide) with an alkali metal salt
of a divalent carbocyclic aromatic radical in the
presence of an appropriate solvent.US-A-5132423 discloses reactions between
a solid polar and a non-polar compound, especially
nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions
between an alkali metal salt of a hydroxyaromatic
compound or thio analog thereof and an activated
halo- or nitro-substituted aromatic compound, are
conducted in a non-polar organic solvent such as
toluene or xylene, in the presence of a
hexaalkylguanidinium or α,ω-bis(pentaalkylguanidinium)alkane
salt, or a corresponding
heterocyclic salt, as a phase transfer catalyst.
The method is particularly useful for the
preparation of bisimides from bisphenol A or 4,4'-biphenol
salts and 4-nitro- or 4-halophthalimides. EP-A-0630931 discloses a class of macrocyclic polyimide
oligomer compositions not containing spiro(bis)indane
moieties. Said compositions may be converted to linear
polyimides. By reason of the low viscosities of the
oligomer compositions in comparison to the linear
polymers, said compositions are capable of employment in
areas from which polyimides have previously been barred.According to said application, the macrocyclic
polyimide oligomers are prepared by the reaction of
equimolar amounts of at least one tetracarboxylic acid or
its dianhydride and at least one diamine. Said reaction
requires pseudo-high dilution conditions; i.e., maintenance
of the reagents at high dilution. Since the condensation
reaction between the acid and the diamine is slow, the rate
of reagent introduction must also be slow and the reaction
may take several hours to go to completion.In recent years, there has been an increase in
interest in the preparation of polyetherimides, a subgenus
of polyimides, by the reaction of substituted bis-phthalimides
with salts of dihydroxyaromatic compounds.
Reference is made, for example, to EP-A-0642544.
This reaction
normally takes place in the presence of phase transfer
catalysts and at relatively high temperatures. Thus, the
phase transfer catalysts employed must be stable at high 
temperatures. Various classes of substituted guanidinium
salts having the required stability are disclosed in EP-A-0642544
and in various patents,
particularly U.S. Patents 5,081,298, 5,082,968,
