<ABSTRACT>
A method for high speed playback of digital video 
data (e.g. D1 or D2 data) in which, at lower speeds, the 

frames of data to be played back are made of a mixture of 
consecutive frames of data. The frames of data are mixed by 

averaging the pixel values over consecutive frames to make 
up the output frames. For high speed shuttle operation, 

non-consecutive frames are averaged on a pixel by pixel 
basis to create shuttle frames. In order to improve the 

appearance of the output, consecutive shuttle frames contain 
a common original frame so that a component of the original 

data spans two output frames.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
playback of digital video as in a digital video tape 
recorder (VTR) or virtual digital VTR. More particularly, 
this invention relates to performing variable speed playback 
and shuttle of compressed digital video material in a manner 
which emulates the performance of a video tape recorder's 
variable speed playback and shuttle. The present invention 
is also useful in instances where temporal compression is 
needed (i.e. judicious merging elements of video frames to 
compensate for smaller display interval of a rapid video 
frame display). In video tape recorders, variable speed playback 
of the video material is generally accomplished by 
increasing the tape speed during playback and providing 
dynamic tracking. In video tape editing application, such 
variable speed playback has a distinctive look which editors 
are accustomed to. When a moving video image is stored digitally and 
retrieved at a higher than normal playback rate, this is 
generally accomplished by simply deleting (or not 
retrieving) frames of information. For example, with 
reference to FIGURE 1, if the ten sequential frames F₁ 
through F₁₀ which are shown in FIGURE 1 are to be played back 
at twice the normal playback rate, only alternate frames 
might be displayed. For example, frames F₁, F₃, F₅, F₇ and F₉ 
would be displayed at the normal frame rate while frames F₂, 
F₄, F₆, F₈ and F₁₀ would be omitted entirely. Consequently, 
only five frames of information would be displayed at a 
standard frame rate requiring only half the display time. 
Thus, the illusion that the image has been displayed at 
twice normal speed is created. Unfortunately, when non-contiguous frames of 
digital video are consecutively displayed to produce a high  
 
speed image, a rough jumpy display results resembling a 
montage or a teleconferencing-type image in which updates 
are slower than real time resulting in discontinuous video. 
This type of implementation thus diverges substantially from 
the look of a video tape recorder's variable speed playback. 
In a video tape recorder, the motion is smooth and 
continuous but occurs at a higher rate. At high speed 
shuttle rates wherein discontinuous frames of video are 
consecutively displayed, the human brain has difficulty 
tracking the movement and little information is thus 
conveyed to the user. It is desirable to create a simulation of this 
variable speed playback such as appears in analog VTR 
equipment for use in technology such as optical, magneto 
o
