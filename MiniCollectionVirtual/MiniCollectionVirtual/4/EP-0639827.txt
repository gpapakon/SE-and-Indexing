with an optimum and shortest distance between magnetic 

heads and a rotary transformer connecting these 
elements in a simple construction and positively 

transmitting signals can be provided. The rotary head 
apparatus comprises a first conductive member 5 which 

is in contact with and electrically connected to lead 
terminals of a winding of a magnetic head 3 and an 

electronic circuit member 6 connected to a conductive 
member provided in an arrangement area 60, which is the 

functionally optimum position of the circuit board 4 
installed on the upper surface of the circuit board 

(the magnetic head side) which is mounted to a rotary 
drum 2 equipped with the magnetic heads 3, and a second 

conductive member 7 which is connected to the 
electronic circuit member 6 and is in contact with and 

is electrically connected to lead terminals of a 
winding of a rotor 8a of a rotary transformer 8, and it 

is possible to arrange the circuit board 4 with an 
optimum and shortest distance between the magnetic head 

3 and the rotary transformer 8, connect these elements 
in a simple construction and transmit signals regularly 

with a reduced transmission loss without being badly 
affected by oscillations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus, for example a
video tape recorder (hereinafter referred to as VTR),
and more particularly, to a rotary head apparatus
utilized in such a magnetic recording/reproducing
apparatus.Previously a helical scanning system has been used
for a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus such as
a VTR, to perform magnetic recording and/or reproducing
by rotary magnetic heads.On such a helical scanning system VTR, for
instance, in the reproducing process, at least two
magnetic heads are installed on a rotary drum and these
heads rotate as if to helically trace a magnetic
recording medium in its running direction to reproduce
signals. The signals thus obtained are then amplified
to a specified level by an electronic circuit such as a
reproduction preamplifier and supplied to a reproducing
circuit via a non-contact rotary transformer
(hereinafter referred to as a rotary transformer) for
reproducing recorded signals. Further, in the case of
recording by a magnetic recording/reproducing
apparatus, signals to be recorded are supplied via such
a rotary transformer. Voltages and currents required
for the recording operation are supplied to the
magnetic head by an electric circuit such as a
recording amplifier. The magnetic head then rotates to
helically trace the recording medium, so that the
signals are magnetically recorded on the recording
medium.As described above, in case of VTRs there is a
rotary transformer between the magnetic head and the
circuit for supplying signals to be recorded to the
magnetic head, or the circuit for amplifying the
signals reproduced by the magnetic head, and therefore 
there is a great transmission loss of the signal.
Various proposals to reduce this transmission loss,
have been made. In these proposals, electronic
circuits such as a reproducing amplifier or a recording
amplifier are provided between the rotary transformer
and the magnetic head.One mounting method has been proposed in which
such electronic circuits as described above are
provided on a circuit board, this circuit board is
arranged on the upper portion of a rotary drum and the
circuit board is connected to a magnetic head and a
rotary transformer through lead wires. In a device
with this structure, electronic circuits and other
electronic components are provided very close to a
magnetic drum more than in previous devices. However,
the electronic circuits and the rotary transformer will
be located far away from each other. Thus as far as a
