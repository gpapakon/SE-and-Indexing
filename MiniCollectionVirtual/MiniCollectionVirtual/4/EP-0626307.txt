<ABSTRACT>
A three wheeled vehicle comprising a single wheel 
(30) mounted on a chassis (8) connected to two 

substantially parallel wheels (1) by means of an 
articulated suspension and a handlebar (17) mounted on 

steering means (31) connected to the chassis (8) and to 
at least one of said wheels (30). The handlebar (17) is 

pivotally jointed to said steering means (31) about a 
substantially longitudinal axis (A), and actuating 

means (18) connected to the handlebar (17) transmits 
the rotation of the latter about the axes (A) to said 

articulated suspension which is subjected to an 
inclination relative to a medium plane with respect to 

said wheels. The articulated suspension comprises a 
rocking beam (6) pivotally connected to the chassis 

(8); shock absorbing rods (4) pivotally jointed to the 
rocking beam (6) and to supporting arms (2) of the 

wheels (1), a stabilizing device having a double acting 
cylinder (12) operated by hydraulic means by actuating 

means (18) moved according to the position of the 
handlebar (17) with respect to said longitudinal axis 

(A). A more natural driving is allowed similarly to the 
driving of two wheelers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a three wheeled
vehicle comprising a single wheel mounted on a chassis
connected with two substantially parallel wheels by means
of an articulated suspension.Three wheeled vehicles, and some types of four
wheeled vehicles, owing to their reduced tread between the
wheels, are not sufficiently steady with respect to
tilting actions which rise in some ride conditions.Really, three wheeled vehicles can not laterally
lean as two wheelers do, in the latter centrifugal actions
being balanced by a corresponding inclination of the
vehicle with its dynamic loads.In three wheeled vehicles and little treaded four
wheeled ones, an increase of the lateral steadiness is
obtained by means of stabilising devices which allow
inclination to the vehicle in order to counteract said
tilting actions.A first type of these stabilising devices comprises
resilient means reducing the transversal stiffness thus
allowing inclination to the vehicle.This first kind of devices, which allow driving
conditions similar to those possible on two wheelers, has
a different resilient reaction versus different loads
carried by the vehicle. For this reason the resilient
means, such as the one present on a three wheeled vehicle
made by Honda, is only sufficient to vertically support
the stationary vehicle when the driver is not present.
The weight of the latter causes the vehicle to lean if a
further stand support is not provided or if the driver
himself doesn't hold the vehicle with one of his legs.
Since a three wheeled vehicle of this type is guided like
a two wheeled one, the effect of aerodynamic actions,
which is not negligible, causes the impossibility of
equipping the vehicle with a complete body comprising a 
cab for the driver.A second type of stabilising devices is mounted on
vehicles which already have their own lateral stability
and can be guided normally, if the aerodynamic and/or
centrifugal lateral actions forces do not reach a
particular value. Above this value such devices operate
actuators capable of leaning the vehicles so as to balance
said aerodynamic and/or centrifugal lateral actions.These devices can be operated by the driver himself,
for example by the depression of pedals, as disclosed in
U.S. patent 4484648 or, in alternative, by dynamic or
positional sensors automatically controlling the leaning
of the vehicle, as disclosed, for example, in
international patent application WO/85103678, where a
gravity-sensitive device controls tilt actuator means.This second type of stabilising devices
