<ABSTRACT>
Compounds useful for enhancing synaptic responses mediated by AMPA receptors are disclosed, as are methods for the preparation thereof, and methods for their use for treatment of subjects suffering from impaired nervous or intellectual functioning due to deficiencies in the number of excitatory synapses or in the number of AMPA receptors. The invention compounds can also be used for the treatment of non-impaired subjects for enhancing performance in sensory-motor and cognitive tasks which depend on brain networks utilizing AMPA receptors and for improving memory encoding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with United States
Government support under Grant No. AFOSR 89-0383, awarded
by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The United
States Government has certain rights in the invention in
the United States.The present invention relates to novel compounds
which are useful, for example, in the prevention of
cerebral insufficiency, to enhance receptor functioning in
synapses in those brain networks responsible for higher
order behaviors, and the like. In a particular aspect, the
invention relates to methods for the use of the compounds
disclosed herein, and to methods for the preparation
thereof.Excitatory synaptic currents at many (probably
most) sites in telencephalon (cortex, limbic system,
striatum; about 90% of human brain) and cerebellum occur
when the transmitter glutamate is released by input axons
onto what are usually referred to as the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic
acid (AMPA), or
AMPA/quisqualate, receptors. Drugs that enhance these
receptor currents will facilitate communication in brain
networks responsible for perceptual-motor integration and 
higher order behaviors. It is also known from the
literature [see Arai and Lynch in Brain Research, in press]
that such drugs will promote the formation of long-term
potentiation, a physiological effect widely held to encode
memory.For example, Ito et al., J. Physiol. Vol.
424:533-543 (1990), discovered that aniracetam,
N-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone, enhances AMPA receptor mediated
currents without affecting currents generated by other
classes of receptors. Unfortunately, however, the drug is
effective only at high concentrations (∼1.0 mM) applied
directly to the brain. The low potency, limited
solubility, and peripheral metabolism of aniracetam limit
its utility as an experimental tool and its potential value
as a therapeutic. There is a need, therefore, for the
design and synthesis of new drugs that are more potent,
more soluble and less readily metabolized than aniracetam.
Such compounds would provide new tools for manipulating the
properties of the AMPA receptor and would be a major step
towards a drug that could enhance AMPA receptor function in
the brain after peripheral administration.We have discovered novel compounds that are
several times more potent than aniracetam in enhancing
synaptic responses (i.e, they produce larger effects than
aniracetam at lower concentrations). The invention
compounds increase the strength of long-term potentiation
and increase synaptic responses in the brain following
