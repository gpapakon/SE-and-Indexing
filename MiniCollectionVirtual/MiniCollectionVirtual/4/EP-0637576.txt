<ABSTRACT>
The invention claims the use of a ceramic article, at least the surface of
which is formed from a zirconia ceramic, in an environment where contact with

water above 60°C occurs. The zirconia ceramic is formed by mixing a first
particulate zirconia composite and a second particulate zirconia composite, the

first composite containing 1 to 4 molar per cent yttria, the second composite
containing 4 to 20 molar per cent yttria and the yttria content of the two

composites differing by at least 2 molar per cent, shaping said mixture to produce
a ceramic green body and sintering said green body at a temperature of at least

1200°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water-resistant ceramic articles
prepared from stabilised zirconia and in particular to the use of such
ceramic articles in applications involving contact with hot water.Ceramics formed from a composition containing zirconia and an
agent such as yttria which has the effect of stabilising the zirconia in the
cubic and/or tetragonal phase at room temperature are well known.
Such ceramics have desirable properties and, in particular, are tough.However, generally, ceramics which have been prepared by
stabilisation of zirconia with yttria are not considered to be useful in
situations involving prolonged contact with hot water since contact with
the water causes degradation. Degradation is rapid at a temperature of
about 200°C but is also of significance at temperatures above about
60°C.UK Patent Application GB 2 234 500 discloses one method of
preparing yttria-stabilised zirconia ceramic articles which are resistant to
attack by water by utilising a particulate zirconia, the particles of which
are coated with a hydrous oxide or oxide of yttrium.It is an object of this invention to provide an alternative means of
preparing ceramic articles which are resistant to attack by hot water.According to the invention use of a ceramic article
comprises exposing said article to water at a temperature of at least
60°C wherein at least the surface of said ceramic article which is exposed
to the water is prepared by forming a mixture of a first particulate
zirconia composite and a second particulate zirconia composite in which
the first particulate zirconia composite contains from 1 to 4 molar per
cent yttria calculated as Y2O3 with respect to zirconia, the second
particulate zirconia composite contains from 4 to 20 molar per cent
yttria calculated as Y2O3 with respect to zirconia and the second
particulate zirconia composite contains at least 2 molar per cent more
yttria calculated as Y2O3 with respect to zirconia than the first
particulate zirconia composite, shaping said mixture to produce a
ceramic green body and sintering said ceramic green body at a
temperature of at least 1200°C but not greater than 1350°C. This invention utilises two different particulate zirconia
composites each of which contains yttria. These composites can be
prepared by any technique which produces a composite in which the
yttria is well distributed. The composite can, for example, be produced
by intimately mixing particulate zirconia and particulate yttria. An
intimate mixture can be produced by, for example,
