<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gear
arrangements.A variety of gear arrangements are known for
transmitting torque through an angle and, in particular,
concern the transmission of power from an engine shaft to
a driven shaft that is situated at a 90Â° angle to the
engine shaft.US Patent No 2,865,219 issued to Alfred W Allen
discloses a power transmission system by which power to
turn a shaft is applied equally to the driven member at a
plurality of circumferential points equally displaced in a
diametrical plane of such driven member. The gear
arrangement includes a driving bevel gear mounted to a
driving shaft. The driving bevel gear is in meshing
engagement with both a driven bevel gear mounted to a
driven shaft and a "cross-over" bevel gear that transmits
power to a fourth gear on the side opposite of the driving
bevel gear. The fourth gear meshes with both the driven
and cross-over gears. In this manner, the patent proposes
to divide the power by applying equal parts of the power
to the driven gear at opposite points. The patent,
however, does not describe a mechanism to ensure that
equal load division will occur, eg, manufacturing
tolerance differences could result in all power going
through one path and none through the other. In other
words, the torque split is indeterminate. The patent
further describes a through shaft that requires an
additional set of bearings and structural elements because
the through shaft turns in an opposing direction to the
gear through which the shaft passes. The gear arrangement
described also does not utilize any power extraction
between the cross-over gear and the driven gear.US Patent No 4,437,355 issued to Andre Bordat
also describes a bevel gear power transmitting arrangement 
having a first bevel gear coupled to a driving shaft, a
second bevel gear coupled to a driven shaft whose axis is
perpendicular to that of the driving shaft and meshing
with the first bevel gear, a third loose bevel gear
coaxial with the second one and meshing with the first
one, and a fourth loose bevel gear coaxial with the first
one and meshing with the second and third ones. In this
manner, the patent claims to double the power transmitted
by a given size bevel gear coupled to the driven axis. To
achieve a proper balancing of the toque from the driving
shaft bevel gear to the two gears with which it is
engaged, the patent proposes mounting the driving gear so
that it remains slightly floating. To do this, however,
the gear arrangement described incorporates a swivel pin,
bearing and

<CLAIMS>
A gear arrangement for transmitting torque from
an output shaft (26) of an engine comprising a pinion

shaft (20) for receiving torque from the output shaft
(26), a pinion (22) mounted concentrically to a first end

of the pinion shaft (20), upper and lower concentric and
opposed face gears (32,34) meshingly engaged with said

pinion (22), means (28) for permitting the pinion to float
such that torque from the pinion shaft (22) is split

equally between the face gears (32,34) and a primary
driven shaft (42, 46) coupled to one of said face gears (32,34)

characterized by at least one non-floating shaft (62)
having a gear (60) in meshing engagement with said first

and second face gears (32,34).
An arrangement according to Claim 1,

characterised by an auxiliary device operatively connected
to and powered by said non-floating shaft (62).
An arrangement according to Claim 2,

characterised by a plurality of non-floating shafts (62)
operatively connected to a plurality of auxiliary devices,

respectively.
An arrangement according to Claim 1,

characterised by a secondary driven shaft (46) coupled to
the other face gear (34) and rotating in a direction

counter to that of said primary driven shaft (42).
An arrangement according to Claim 4,

characterised in that the secondary driven shaft (46) is
operatively connected to an auxiliary device.
An arrangement according to any one of Claims 1
to 5, characterised in that said primary driven shaft (70)

is mounted to said lower face gear (34) and extends
upwardly through said upper face gear (32).
An arrangement according to any one of Claims 1
to 6, characterised by means (130) for restraining the 

pinion (22) in the event of failure of one of the face
gears (32,34).
An arrangement according to any one of Claims 1
to 7, characterised by bearings (116,118) and a plate (74)

interposed between the face gears (32,34), said bearings
(116,118) being mounted to a cylindrical mount portion

(78) of said plate (74) for locating a lower end of said
upper face gear (32) and an upper end of said lower face

gear (34).
An arrangement according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that said means (28) for permitting the

pinion to float includes means for permitting the pinion
to float radially and axially such that torque from the

pinion shaft (20) is split equally between the face gears
(32,34).
