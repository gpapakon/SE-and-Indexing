<ABSTRACT>
In a device for restraining rats or the like in a sewage duct, it is provided that a pipe piece, which can be inserted into a vertically running region of the sewage duct and whose inner cross-section is designed corresponding to the sewage duct, exhibits pivot mounts which are arranged in the region outside its pipe wall and are intended for a plurality of bar-shaped blocking members which are distributed over the circumference of the pipe piece and pass through openings in the pipe piece. In the use position, the bar-shaped blocking members are arranged in a formation corresponding to the contour of a funnel or cone, such that they are oriented obliquely downwards and inwards and towards one another and can be pivoted individually around the pivot mounts, counter to the action of a prestressing force, in the direction of the inner wall of the pipe piece. Consequently, on the one hand, the access of rats or similar animals counter to the flow direction is reliably prevented. On the other hand, there is no marked cross-sectional reduction for the sewage throughflow, as a result of which the risk of a blockage is reduced or eliminated.
