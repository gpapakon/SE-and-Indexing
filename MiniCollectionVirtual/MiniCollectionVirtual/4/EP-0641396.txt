<ABSTRACT>
Process for beneficiating particulate titanium-bearing material containing iron oxides comprising: (a) contacting in a mechanical reduction kiln, particulate titanium-bearing material, particulate carbonaceous reducing material, and HCl or one or more materials which will produce HCl during step (a), or mixtures thereof, said contacting taking place in the substantial absence of titanium chlorination and while (i) the mechanical reduction kiln turns and cascades the material therein, (ii) a temperature of about 900-1100 degrees C is maintained, and (iii) reducing conditions are maintained, said particulate titanium bearing material having a mean diameter of less than about 40 microns, which diameter exists in the ore which is introduced into the kiln or is ground in the kiln to have such diameter, said step (a) causing iron oxide to be converted to metallic iron and causing liberation of the metallic iron from the titanium bearing material, said contacting continuing until the metallic iron produced in step (b) has a mean diameter of at least about 50 microns, (b) removing the resulting products from step (a) from the kiln, and (c) separating the metallic iron and titanium-bearing material from the resulting products from step (b).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method 
for beneficiating titanium-bearing material containing 
iron. High grade titanium-bearing material 
containing low amounts of iron is becoming increasingly 
scarce and expensive. While low grade titanium-bearing 
material containing significant amounts of iron can be 
used in the chloride process for making titanium dioxide 
pigment or titanium metal, significant amounts of iron 
chloride byproduct are produced. Some byproduct iron 
chloride can be used as a flocculant to remove sediment 
in the treatment process to produce potable water. 
Because, however, the amount of iron chloride required 
for this use is limited, the production of significant 
amounts of iron chloride can be a waste disposal 
problem. A number of different processes have been 
proposed to beneficiate titanium-bearing material 
containing iron. These processes, however, appear to be 
deficient in one or more aspects, including, (a) being 
expensive or not feasible on an industrial scale or (b) 
producing iron chloride which has the aforementioned 
disposal problems, and producing low-grade iron. The following information is to disclose which 
may be of interest in the examination of this 
application: 
   U.S. patent 3,929,463 discloses a continuous 
method of effecting an endothermic metallurgical  
 
reduction reaction in the reactor space of a rotatable 
mechanical kiln which functions as a reaction vessel. 
During the reaction, the charged kiln is rotated at a 
speed which is lower than the speed at which the charge 
closest to the kiln ceases to move relative to the wall. 
The charge is thereby disintegrated and heated to effect 
the reaction. The reaction carried out can be the 
reduction of iron, copper, nickel or zinc oxides or 
sulfides. It is also disclosed that the process can be 
used to reduce the iron content in titaniferous 
magnetite and ilmenite in the form of magnetic power 
which then can be separated magnetically. British patent 1,397,200 discloses a process 
for producing metallic iron from materials containing 
iron oxides and a nonferrous metal oxide. In the 
process, the oxide containing material is heated in a 
furnace in the presence of hydrogen chloride, a flux, 
and a solid carbonaceous material, to a temperature 
below that at which a slag is formed. UK published patent application 2,000,755 
states that particles containing a mixture of iron and 
titanium oxide can be heated in a nonoxidizing 
environment with an iron salt or a precursor thereof to 
segregat

Process for beneficiating particulate titanium-bearing material 
containing iron oxides comprising: 


(a) subjecting said particulate titanium-bearing material to reducing 
conditions in the substantial absence of a flux in the presence of particulate 

carbonaceous reducing material to convert about 20-90 percent of the iron oxides to 
metallic iron, 
(b) feeding to a separate mechanical reduction kiln, and contacting, in the 
substantial absence of a flux, the products resulting from step (a), particulate 

carbonaceous reducing material, and HCl or one or more materials which will 
produce HCl during step (b), or mixtures thereof, 


said contacting taking place in the substantial absence of titanium chlorination 
and while (i) the mechanical reduction kiln turns and cascades the material therein, 

(ii) a temperature of about 900-1100 degrees C is maintained, and (iii) reducing 
conditions are maintained, 
said particulate titanium-bearing material being ground during step (b), with 
the aid of grinding media, to have a mean diameter of less than about 40 micrometers,

liberation of the metallic iron from the titanium bearing material,
