<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a surgical drill made of metal, for instance made of surgical grade stainless steel or carbon steel, intended for use when implanting cylindrical implants into bone tissue, preferably dental implants made of titanium. The body (3) of the drill (1) is coated by a thin layer of titanium nitride (TiN). The layer of titanium nitride is brightly coloured and circumferential bands (8, 9, 10, 11) having a darker colour have been etched around the envelope surface of the body (3) of the drill, said bands (8, 9, 10, 11) being located at predetermined distances from each other and having predetermined widths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to surgical drills made of metal as defined in the preamble of claim 1,
for instance made of surgical grade stainless steel, which are intended for use when
implanting cylindrical implants into bone tissue, preferably dental implants made of titanium.
The invention also relates to a method for treating such drills as defined in the preamble of
claim 3. Relevant background art is disclosed in DE-A-3339004.When implants are fitted into bone tissue, different kinds of metallic surgical tools are used
to prepare the site in the tissue where the implant is to be located. These tools normally are
made of carbon steel (normally in disposable tools) or surgical grade stainless steel
(normally in non-disposable tools).In some cases it may however be advantageous if at least the surface of the tools are
covered with a material which is more biocompatible than the material in the tool even if the
tool is not to remain in the bone tissue for a long period of time. This material of course
should be equally hard or harder than the material in the tool. This is particularly
advantageous in drills. Drills will be in a close contact with the tissue during a relatively
long period of time since their sides are in rotary contact with the sides of the borehole
during the entire time the front part of the drill is cutting through the bone tissue. If the drill
is not of an inert material as regards the chemical environment prevalent in bone tissue and
blood, some slight contaminations may affect the sides of the bore hole. These contaminants
can affect the so-called osseointegration process which is important in connection with bone
implants and which seems to be sensitive in respect of contaminants. Another prerequisite for a good osseointegration is a good, stable fit between bone tissue
and implants, the osseointegration being dependent on a close contact between bone tissue
and implant surface. When a bore-hole for an implant is drilled, it therefore is important that
the length of the bore-hole corresponds as closely as possible to the length of the implant
chosen.It is also very important that the bore-holes are drilled to an exact, pre-determined depth in
the parts of the jaw where the nerve is located in order to avoid damage to the nerve.The above problems are solved by means of a drill of the kind described introductorily and
having the features defined in the characterising clause of claim 1. The drill is coated by a
thin, brightly coloured layer of titanium nitride (TiN). Titanium nitride

<CLAIMS>
Surgical drill made of metal, for instance made of surgical grade stainless steel or
carbon steel, intended for use when implanting cylindrical implants into bone tissue,

preferably dental implants made of titanium, the body (3) of said drill (1) being coated by a
thin, brightly coloured layer of titanium nitride (TiN), 
characterized
 in that
circum-ferential bands (8, 9, 10, 11) having a colour that is darker than said brightly

coloured layer have been etched around an envelope surface of the body (3) of the drill, said
bands (8, 9, 10, 11) being located at pre-determined distances from each other and having

pre-determined widths.
Surgical drill according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that each band
(9, 10) has a width of 2 mm, apart from the band (8) located next to the tip of the drill and

the band located next to the neck of the drill which have a width of 1 mm, the distance
between the edges of each pair of adjacent bands being 2 mm.
Method for treating surgical bone drills made of metal, for instance surgical grade
stainless steel or carbon steel, intended for use when implanting implants into bone tissue,

preferably dental implants made of titanium, comprising the step of
coating the drill with a thin layer of titanium nitride (TiN) by means of chemical vapour

deposition until the drill obtains a bright permanent colour,
characterized
 by the step of etching circumferential bands with pre-determined
widths and being located at pre-determined distances from each other around

the outer surface of the drill by means of a laser beam, the bands thus being dark and
sharply defined.
