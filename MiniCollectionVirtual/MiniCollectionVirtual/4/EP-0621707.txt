<ABSTRACT>
A control system for automated management of frequency-hopping 
in a radio network. The system includes a 

Wireless Network Manager (WNM) or Controller and a 
Wireless Control Agent (WCA), which control the 

distribution and maintenance of hopping patterns in the 
radio network. In a single cell network, the WNM and the 

WCA are included in a single base station. In a multiple 

cell network, the WNM is in a specific station on a LAN, 
and a WCA is located in each base station on the LAN. In 

each instance, the WNM is a centralized managing station 
and the WCA acts as a cell controller.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to data communications,
and in particular such communications in a Local Area
Network (LAN). Specifically, the invention is directed
to frequency hopping pattern assignment, interference
monitoring, and hopping pattern revision in a multiple
autonomous collocated radio network environment.A multicell radio LAN installation based on Slow
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum signalling may consist
of a set of base stations with overlapping coverage
areas. In a Frequency-Hopping (FH) system, the carrier
frequency of the transmitter changes at intervals of
time, remaining constant between those instants. The
period of constant frequency is called a "hop" and it is
during these hops that messages may be exchanged. In a
Slow Frequency Hopping system, the duration of a hop is
at least an order of magnitude longer than typical
message transmission time. A multicell radio LAN may
also be referred to as a Logical LAN. Key to the
successful operation of Logical LANs are effective
methods for the control of interference.There are a number of patents in this general technological
area, each having certain advantages and disadvantages.U.K. patent application GB 2,203,314A to Heading discloses
a frequency hopping assignment arrangement having 
a processor in which is stored terrain data, radio
performance data and hopper performance data. The
processor is provided with a keyboard whereby
geographical input information, information relating to
the nets and the assignment requirements are entered.
The processor is arranged to execute an algorithm in
which the stored data and the information input by the
input means causes the frequency hopping arrangement to
assign the hopping frequencies.U.S. Patent 4,872,205 to Smith discloses a frequency-hopping
communication system that when initially enabled,
it detects another system operating within range by
listening for a predefined radio frequency of a fixed
duration. When that particular frequency is detected,
the system knows that a master system is operating within
range and is utilizing a first predetermined group of
communication frequencies and, consequently, selects a
second, third, etc. predetermined group of communication
frequencies. If the particular radio frequency is not
detected, the system becomes the master system, selects
the first predetermined group of communication
frequencies for intrasystem communication and begins
transmitting the predefined radio frequency to indicate
its master status.U.S. Patent 4,850,036 to Smith
