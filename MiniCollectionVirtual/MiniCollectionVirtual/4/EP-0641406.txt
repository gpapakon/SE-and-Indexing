Process plant which has at least one process 
cycle (1) and/or continuous process with in each case 

at least one associated liquid ring machine (2) in 
continuous operation, whereby the process-operating 

side (1) and the pump-operating side (3) are connected 
to each other by at least one connection line (4) and 

whereby on the pump-operating side (3) there is 
provided a dosing device (5), arranged in front of the 

liquid ring machine (2) when seen in the flow 
direction, for a dosed addition of macromolecular 

substances. 
Process plant which has at least one process 
cycle (1) and/or continuous process with in each case 

at least one associated liquid ring machine (2) in 
cycle operation, whereby the process-operating side (1) 

and the pump-operating side (3) are connected to each 
other by at least one connection line (4) and whereby 

on the pump-operating side (3) there is provided a 
dosing device (5) for a dosed addition of 

macromolecular substances. 
Process plant which has at least one process 
cycle (1) and/or continuous process with in each case 

at least one hydraulic pump, whereby on the pump-suction 
side there is provided a dosing device (5) for 

a dosed addition of macromolecular substances. 
Process plant according to claim 1 or 2, 
whereby the liquid ring machine (2) operates as a 

liquid ring pump. 
Process plant according to claim 3, whereby 
the hydraulic pump (2) is constructed as a centrifugal 

pump. 
Process plant according to claim 2, whereby 
the dosing device (5) for the macromolecular substances 

is arranged in front of the liquid ring machine (2) 
when seen in the flow direction.  

 
Process plant according to one of claims 1 to 
3, whereby the macromolecular substances are supplied 

in powder form. 
Process plant according to claim 1 or 2, 
whereby the process cycle (1) and/or the pump cycle (3) 

each have a removal line (6, 7). 
Process plant according to claim 3, whereby 
the process cycle (1) has a removal line (6). 
Process plant according to claim 8 or 9, 
whereby the removal lines (6, 7) are guided to a 

purifying plant (8). 
Process plant according to claim 1 or 2, 
whereby the process cycle (1) and the pump cycle (3) 

each have a supply line (9, 10) for the supply of 
process liquid or operating liquid. 
Process plant according to claim 3, whereby 
the process cycle (1) has a supply line (9) for the 

supply of process liquid. 
Process plant according to claim 8 and 11 or 
according to claim 10 and 11 or according to claim 9 

and 12, whereby the removal line (6) of the process 
cycle (1) and the supply line (9) of the process cycle 

(1) are connected to each other by way of a return line 
(15). 
Process plant according to claim 8 and 11 or 
according to claim 10 and 11, whereby the removal line 

(7) of the pump cycle (3) and the supply line (10) of 
the pump cycle (3) are connected to each other by way 

of a return line (16).
