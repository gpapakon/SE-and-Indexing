<ABSTRACT>
A power managing apparatus in an electronic 
apparatus using a battery comprises a residual power 

quantity detector for detecting a residual quantity of 
the battery; a time setter for setting a time; a 

judging unit for judging whether the electronic 
apparatus can be driven until the set time or not on 

the basis of the detected residual quantity of the 
battery; and an alarm display for notifying the result 

of the judgment. The set time is an operable time of 
the electronic apparatus or an operable time obtained 

from the next charging time or can be input by a pen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power managing
apparatus which manages an electric power consumption
of a power source in an electronic apparatus.Hitherto, in order to reduce a power consumption
in an electronic apparatus, its performance is
purposely deteriorated to a level lower than the
conventional one.For example, in case of an electronic apparatus
having a switch for switching a clock frequency, a
power consumption can be reduced by decreasing the
clock frequency.In case of an electronic apparatus having a dial
which changes a luminance of a display screen, a power
consumption can be reduced by decreasing the luminance.In the above conventional apparatuses, however,
since the clock frequency or the luminance of the
display screen is manually switched, particularly, in a
portable apparatus which is driven by a battery, it is
difficult to adjust an electric power to enable the
battery to be used until the battery is replaced at the
next time or the battery is charged. Due to this,
there is a drawback such that a power quantity of the 
battery is extinguished earlier than it is expected or,
on the contrary, the performance is excessively
suppressed in spite of the fact that a power quantity
of the battery still remains.EP 0 207 054 discloses the features according to the preamble of
claim 1.The present invention is made in consideration of
the above situations and it is an object of the
invention to provide a power manager which can supply
an electric power for at least a set time.According to the present invention, the above
object is accomplished by a power managing apparatus
and method as defined in claims 1 and 8, respectively.According to the power managing apparatus having 
the above construction, assuming that the time until
the next battery is supplied is set by the setting
means, the detecting means obtains the residual
amount of the power quantity of the battery. The
calculating means obtains the power consumption
capable of supplying a power for the time which was set
by the setting means on the basis of the residual
amount of the power quantity. The managing means
manages the performance of the electronic apparatus so
that the power which is actually consumed does not
exceed the power consumption obtained by the
calculating means. Due to this, the power can be
supplied for at least the set time.Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the first
embodiment of a power manager of the invention;Fig. 2 is an external view of an electronic
apparatus to which the power manager of the invention
