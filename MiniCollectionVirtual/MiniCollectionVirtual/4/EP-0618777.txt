<ABSTRACT>
The vacuum cleaner described has a container (2) containing liquid and connected to a low-pressure chamber (4) in which an underpressure is generated by means of a fan unit (6). A suction line (9) which can be connected to the vacuum-cleaner hose passes into the container (2), terminating at a point near the base of the container (2). In order to control the agitation produced in the liquid in the container (2), and to prevent air bubbles carrying moisture and dust from escaping through the air outlets (8) in the fan unit (6), the container (2) is fitted with baffle plates (14) which are staggered with respect to each other. Only part of the edge of each baffle plate (14) abuts the wall of the container (2), while the part of the edge not abutting the container wall is fitted with downwards-pointing attachments (17, 19), as is the underside of each baffle plate.

<CLAIMS>
Vacuum cleaner having a liquid container (2) communicating with a 
vacuum chamber (4) in which a vacuum is generated via a blower (6), a 

suction line (9) starting from the base region of the liquid container 
(2) and running upwards, lamellae (14) extending in the liquid 

container (2) crosswise relative to said suction line (9) merely over 
a portion of the cross section of the liuqid container (2), a portion 

of the circumference of each lamella (14) abutting the container wall 
and the remaining portion of the circumference of each lamella (14) 

arranged at a distance from the container wall being provided with an 
extension (17) projecting downwards and preferably bent backwards, the 

portion of the circumference abutting the container wall of adjacent 
lamellae (14) being disposed staggered in relation to one another, 

preferably at approximately opposite points of the container wall, 
characterized in that at least one further extension (19) projecting 

downwards and preferably bent backwards in the direction of the 
portion of the circumference of the lamellae abutting the container 

wall is provided on the underside of the lamellae (14). 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
portion of the circumference of the lamellae (14) abutting the 

container wall is sealed in relation to said container wall, 
preferably by me
ans of a seal (20), for instance of rubber or elastic 
plastics material. 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
lamellae (14) are held by rod-shaped or tubular supports (15) 

extending approximately crosswise to the lamella plane, the position 
of the lamellae (14) on the supports (15) preferably being ajustable. 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
supports (15) are formed of threaded rods screwed onto the supporting 

nuts (16) for the lamellae (14).  
 
Vacuum cleaner according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
plane of the lamellae (14) is inclined downwards in relation to the 

portion of the circumference of the lamellae arranged at a distance 
from the container wall.
