<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a new installation for fighting fire which is improved over known installations for such units which have a hydraulic system. According to the invention, the hydraulic system is arranged to be driven with water as drive medium, and preferably at least a part of sprinklers or spray heads intended for fighting fire are connected to the power source of the hydraulic system via the pressure line of the hydraulic system. Earlier required double pipe systems and double power sources are no longer necessary; the same system can be utilized for fire fighting as well as for numerous regular hydraulic functions e.g. in a tanker.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic system for a unit, such as a ship.In many ships a number of important regular functions are performed by means of a hydraulic system for which oil has been used as the drive medium. In those known ships a separate installation has been used for fighting fire.US-A-4786239 discloses a pumping system for shipboard use comprising a submersible centrifugal pump driven by a high pressure hydraulic motor mounted directly on the submersible pump. The hydraulic motor is connected by a hose to a hydraulic pump which is located on deck and driven by a standby fire pump.The aim of the present invention is to provide a hydraulic system in a unit which can also be used for fighting fire.Accordingly, the present invention provides a hydraulic system according to claim 1.It will of course be understood that the water employed in the system of the present invention can include certain additives, for example anti-corrosion additives. The power source of the hydraulic system is preferably a hydraulic pump having a high operating pressure and a high volume capacity. The pump is usually driven by a main power source, such as an electric generator.In a preferred embodiment at least some of the sprinklers or spray heads are connected to a pressure line of the hydraulic system.Some of the sprinklers or spray heads can be connected to a return line of the hydraulic system, the return line being arranged to be closed downstream of the last sprinkler or spray head when the hydraulic system is activated.Use of the present invention means that double pipe systems and double power sources are not necessary since the same system can be utilized for fire fighting as well as for performing the regular hydraulic functions. In addition to considerable savings in installation hardware and installation work, a significant reduction in weight is also achieved; this being of particular advantage in high-speed ships.In some cases it may be of advantage to connect at least some of the sprinklers or spray heads to the power source through at least one further line separate from the at least one line of the hydraulic system.In such an embodiment the subsidiary lines can be utilized for performing certain additional functions essential when a fire has broken out, such as closing fire doors, driving elevators, etc.. If the regular main power source, usually an electric generator, fails in a fire, an emergency generator, often having less power than the regular generator, can be capable of providing

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulic system in a unit, the hydraulic system being to drive regular hydraulic functions of the unit and including a drive medium, a power source for driving the drive medium, and a pressure line and a return line for conducting the drive medium through the hydraulic system; 
characterised in that
 the drive medium is water and 
in that
 the hydraulic system further includes sprinklers or spray heads connected to the power source via the pressure line and optionally the return line, the sprinklers or spray heads utilizing the water of the hydraulic system as a fire-extinguishing medium and being adapted to fight fire in the unit, whereby the hydraulic system can be utilised for fire fighting as well as for the regular hydraulic functions of the unit.
The hydraulic system as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least some of the sprinklers or spray heads are connected to the pressure line of the hydraulic system.
The hydraulic system as claimed in claim 2, wherein at least some of the sprinklers or spray heads are connected to the return line of the hydraulic system, the return line being arranged to be closed downstream of the last sprinkler or spray head when the hydraulic system is activated.
The hydraulic system as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least some of the sprinklers or spray heads are connected to the power source through at least one further line separate from the said pressure line or the said return line of the hydraulic system.
The hydraulic system as claimed in claim 4, wherein the at least one further line is configured to provide a number of functions in the event of a fire, such as closing fire doors.
The hydraulic system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the power source has an operating pressure of at least 100 bar.
The hydraulic system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the power source comprises a high pressure and high volume pump.
