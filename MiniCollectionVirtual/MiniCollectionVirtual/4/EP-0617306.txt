<ABSTRACT>
An image projection device comprising at least one display panel 
(26,27,28), 

a projection lens system (C) and an autofocus system is 
described. The 

focus-error detection system comprises an auxiliary radiation source 
(50) delivering a 

focus measuring beam (b), an auxiliary lens (61) for capturing 
radiation (b
r
) diffusely 
reflected by a projection screen (D), and a detection unit (60) for 

measuring the size of 
a spot (S) formed on the screen by the beam (b). 

The auxiliary radiation source is positioned at the same distance from 
the lens as the display panel, i.e. they are in the same optical plane. 

The focus measuring beam passes the projection 200m lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an image projection apparatus comprising a 
display system having at least a display panel for generating an image to be projected, a 
projection lens system for projecting the image formed by the display system on a 
projection screen, a focus-error detection system provided with an auxiliary radiation 
source which supplies a focus measuring beam, and a detection unit for converting the 
focus measuring beam radiation reflected by the projection screen into a focus-error 
signal. The term image projection device is considered to have a wide meaning 
and comprises a device for displaying, for example a video image, a graphic image, 
numerical information or a combination thereof. The images may be both monochrome 
and color images. In the latter case the display system may comprise three chrominance 
channels for, for example the primary colors red, green and blue, each accommodating 
a display panel. A display panel may be constituted by the display screen of a cathode 
ray tube but is preferably a liquid crystalline panel. In the latter case the display system 
comprises an illumination unit for illuminating the panel or the panels. In the current image projection devices which comprise one projection 
lens system in the form of a zoom lens for projecting a magnified image on a projection 
screen which is present at, for example several meters from the projection device, each 
change of the projection distance necessitates refocusing of the image by readjusting the 
zoom lens manually or possibly via a remote control unit. Moreover, optical elements 
of the image projection device may be displaced with respect to each other due to, inter 
alia temperature variations, so that the projected image may be defocused. The known 
image projection devices thus require an additional quantity of time, attention and 
expertise of the user. The convenience of use of an image projection device would be  
 
enhanced considerably if it were provided with an autofocus system, i.e. a system with 
which the distance between a display panel and the projection screen is measured and 
the focus of the projection lens system is automatically adjusted with reference to said 
measurement. An image projection device in which an auxiliary radiation source emits 
an invisible, infrared measuring beam to the screen and in which the radiation beam 
reflected by the screen is received by a position-sensitive detector is described in the 
published Japanese Patent Application (Kokai) 3-149538. The distance
