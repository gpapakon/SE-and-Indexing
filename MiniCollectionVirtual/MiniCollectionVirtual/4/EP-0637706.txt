<ABSTRACT>
Improved spiral grooves in a mechanical face seal have 
plural terminal corners which more evenly distribute the 

fluid pressure generated within the seal gap into 
discrete pressure zones which are radially displaced and 

may also be circumferentially displaced from the other 
pressure zones generated by the same groove. Alternative 

embodiments include grooves having surfaces of varying 
depths wherein each of the plural terminal groove corners 

is associated with a section of the groove having a 
surface at a particular depth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to rotary 
mechanical end face seals and more particularly to rotary 
mechanical end face seals having spiral grooves for creating 
a fluid gap between the sealing faces. Mechanical face seals long have been used for 
sealing between a housing and a relatively rotating shaft. 
More recently, grooves have been introduced into the sealing 
face of at least one of the sealing rings to help generate a 
gap between the seal faces, which gap separates the rings. 
These type of seals are generally referred to as non-contacting 
seals. Spiral grooves have been utilized for 
pumping fluid between the seal faces so that the fluid 
creates a small gap between the faces during shaft rotation. 
Examples of spiral grooved faces are found in U.S. Patent No. 
3,499,653 and in No. 4,212,475, both of which are commonly 
assigned with the present invention and the teachings thereof 
which are incorporated herein by reference. The spiral grooves heretofore disclosed comprise 
two generally smooth boundary curves which separate the 
grooved area from the land. These two boundary curves are 
essentially parallel to each other and each terminate at end 
points disposed essentially at the same radial distance from 
the centerline of the seal face. These two end points are 
joined by a transverse boundary which, for the most part, 
extends in the circumferential direction to produce the 
spiral groove patterns shown in Fig. 2 of each of U.S. Patent 
Nos. 3,499,653 and 4,212,475. It has been found that spiral grooves of the prior 
art seals are effective for providing a gap between the seal  
 
faces. Nevertheless, these types of seal face patterns have 
characteristics that result from the shape of the grooves. 
The shape of the grooves includes a single terminal corner at 
the point where the trailing boundary of the groove 
intersects a circumferential boundary of the groove to 
provide an acute angle at the intersection point. The angle 
is located between the two circumferential edges of the 
sealing face and is referred to herein as a terminal corner. The single terminal corner design results in a 
pressure "zone" that is created adjacent the terminal corner 
of each groove. For the set of grooves in a standard spiral 
groove seal face, one such zone is produced by each groove. 
It is thought that this pressure zone occurs at a spot on the 
land immediately adjacent the groove terminal corner, and 
more specifically, at the edge of the land opposite the 
direction in which the seal face is
