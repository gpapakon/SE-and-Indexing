<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to ferromagnetic tows towed behind a vessel to make magnetically triggered mines explode. It consists in, for cancelling the residual magnetic field of each element of the tow, in measuring (201) the magnetic field gradient on the axis of this element and on the outside thereof, then in modifying (205) the magnetism of the cores (10) forming the element so as to minimise this gradient. The operation is carried out by retroaction in a closed loop. It makes it possible to store the elements of the tow on the deck of the tower without the risk of obtaining a magnetic field which is too intense which risks making the mines explode.

Process for the automatic compensation of the 
magnetization of a magnetized element with the aid of a 

coil surrounding this element, in which an electric 
current is passed through this coil, the strength of the 

current being determined by measuring the gradient of the 
magnetic field outside and in proximity to this element 

so as to minimize the value of this gradient, characterized 
in that this element is an element of a 

ferromagnetic sweep designed to be towed by a ship, in 
that this element includes an odd-numbered set of cores 

(101) arranged with a central core and at least one ring 
including an even number of cores surrounding this 

central core, in that the value of the gradient is 
measured (201) on the magnetic axis of the central core, 

in that the cores of the ring are magnetized to saturation 
in alternate directions in respect of two contiguous 

cores, in that the magnetization of the central core is 
restored substantially to 0, and in that the magnetization 

of the central core is modified slightly about this 
0 value in order to minimize the value of the measured 

gradient.

in that all the cores are firstly demagnetized and in 

that the magnetization of each core is then successively 
modified slightly about the zero value thus obtained in 

order to minimize the value of the measured gradient. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the procedure is iteratively repeated until the 

substantially zero value of the finally obtained gradient 
no longer varies from one iteration to the next.
