<ABSTRACT>
An esterification or amidation process comprises reacting a hydroxylated compound or an organic amine with an oxyacid or its anion capable of accepting a lone pair of electrons. The reaction has the advantage that it is carried out under mild conditions in a single step and enables phosphate and other esters of organic compounds (particularly mono- and oligo-saccharides) to be prepared easily.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ΞSTERIFICATION PROCESSThe present: invention relates to a process for the esterification of hydroxylated compounds.Esters, particularly phosphate esters, are widespread in nature and occupy a central role in biochemical processes . Of special interest are carbohydrate phosphates which are used extensively for studying biosynthetic pathways, and inositol phosphates which act as secondary cellular messengers . However, because these compounds are often present at low concentration and are usually difficult to isolate in pure form, it is often necessary to synthesise them chemically.A number of pharmaceutical products possess ester functionalities. Examples include betamethasone, which is used in the treatment of asthma, and menadiol, which is used for haemorrhage control. Both of these compounds are orthophosphates. Phosphate esters are structural feature's of several bacterial polysaccharides which are used in vaccines to protect against diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis; synthetic antigens with this type of structure have, in recent years, been prepared with a view to using them as synthetic vaccines. It is therefore clear that the introduction of the ester functional group is necessary for the preparation of a number cf pharmaceutical products.Another area in which esters have proved to be useful is in detailed biochemical studies, including studying the effects cf structural modifications on the biological activitv cf various compounds. Such studies include oharmaccicσical testinσ of new druσs and therapeutic 

agents and also investigations into the mechanism of diseases including cancer. In studies such as these, it is often particularly useful to use radioactive esters into which a radioactive isotope of one of the atoms has been incorporated.It is often impossible to obtain the required ester compounds by any other method than chemical synthesis but, in fact, the chemical synthesis of esters has, in the past, proved to be extremely difficult. Direct methods for the synthesis of esters are available and an example of such a method is the esterification of a hydroxylated compound (HC) using phosphoric acid or polyphosphoric acid (MacDonald, The Carbohydrates, 1A, 254 (1972) . Pigman and D. Horton (Eds) . Academic Press, New York) . However, the utility of this" method is limited because many HCs are sensitive to the reaction conditions which are, of course, strongly acidic and often the products undergo further reaction to form modified compounds such as cyclic esters or anhydrides.
