<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to techniques for monitoring and
surveying a hydrocarbon reservoir penetrated by a well. More particularly
the invention concems a method, and a device for its implementation, in
which at least two electrodes are located in the said well, spaced apart
from each other along the length of the well and connected to a current
source and to means for measuring an electrical parameter, from which a
characteristic of the reservoir is deduced. The parameter is the potential
or the current and the characteristic of the reservoir is the resistivity
of the geological formations forming the reservoir.The production of hydrocarbons needs to be controlled and monitored
regularly or continuously, in order to determine the cause of any reduction
or stoppage in production and in order to attempt to remedy it. Apart from
depending on the installed production facility, production also depends on
characteristics of the reservoir, not only static characteristics (i.e.
porosity) but also dynamic characteristics (intercommunication between the
pores, permeability, etc.). An important item of information in this
respect is the position in the reservoir of the hydrocarbon/water or
hydrocarbon/gas interface.It is of fundamental importance not only to detect a possible
pocket of water or gas but to know its position at any instant, in order to
avoid the water reaching the production well.The electrical resistivity of the ground is used in known manner as
a representative characteristic of the reservoir. The resistivity of
hydrocarbons is much higher than the resistivity of the formation water
which carries salt (in a ratio of around 100 to 1). The measurement is
effected upon drilling the production well, with a logging sonde having
electrodes or with an induction sonde, means being provided to allow the
resistivity of the strata which traversed by the well to be determined.An example of a known technique using electrical potential in
cased hole applications for sensing multi-phase fluid flow in formations
is United States Patent No. 5,214,384.United States Patent No. 5,214,384 for a "Method Including
Electrical Self Potential Measurements For Detecting Multiphase Flow
In A Cased Hole" discusses measurement of spontaneous or self
potential at various depths in a wellbore to develop a steam injection
profile of a formation or reservoir during thermally enhanced oil
recovery operations. Changes in the measured electrical self-potential
allow for monitoring the advancement of the injected steam front
