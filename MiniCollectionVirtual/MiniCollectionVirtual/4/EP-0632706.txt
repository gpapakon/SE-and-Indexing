<ABSTRACT>
A device for moving an endoscope (2) through a channel-like cavity (4) has (a) a reversible hose (20) having an outer area (26) which remains stationary with respect to the cavity wall when the device is used and an inner area (24) which receives a partial length of the endoscope (2, (b) a power driving device (18) for moving the front part of the endoscope (2) located inside the cavity (4) and the one of the inner area (24) of the reversible hose (20); and (c) a device for determining the displacement of the endoscope (2) in such a way that the speed of advance of the front part of the endoscope (2) be substantially half the speed of the front part of the inner area (24) of the reversible hose (20) when the power driving device (18) is actuated.

<CLAIMS>
A device for moving an endoscope shaft (8) along a
canal-shaped cavity (4), said device comprising a

reversible tube (20) which receives at least a partial
length of said endoscope shaft (8) and which, upon use of

said device, has a front outer wall area (26) that remains
stationary with respect to the cavity wall, said front

outer wall area (26) being fixed at its one end to a
driving means (18) for moving said endoscope shaft (8) and

being reversed at a distal end portion (6) of said
endoscope shaft (8) to form an inner wall area (24),


characterized in that
said driving means (18) has driving wheels which apply a
radial pressing force on a portion of said inner wall area

(24) of said reversible tube (20) whereby a driving force
can be transmitted via said inner wall area (24) to said

endoscope shaft (8) for continuos movement thereof, whose
rate of motion is, by means of a motion determining means

(22, 72) acting on said endoscope shaft (8), controllable
with respect to the rate of motion of said inner wall area

(24) such that the rate of motion of said inner wall area
(24) is substantially double the rate of motion of said

endoscope shaft (8).
A device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

said motion determining means (72) is designed such that it
continuously applies to said endoscope shaft (8) a driving 

or braking force counteracting said first driving means
(18).
A device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that

said motion determining means (72) comprises a number of
driving wheels (36) drivable by an electric motor which are

directly pressed onto said endoscope shaft (8).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 said inner wall area (24) is, at a
rear end portion opposite to said distal end portion (6) of

said endoscope shaft (8), reversed to form a rear outer
wall area which is led back to said driving means (18) and

is fixed to the same.
A device according to claim 4, 
characterized in that

said motion determining means (72) includes a plate (22)
which is fixed on said endoscope shaft (8) in front of said

rear end portion of said reversible tube (20) and is
preferably supported on a movable slide.
A device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized by
 a pressure fluid supply means (28) by
means of which pressure fluid can be supplied into a space

between said outer wall area (26) and said inner wall area
(24) of said reversible tube (20).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized by
 a lubricant injecting means (82) injecting
lubricant into a gap between said endoscope shaft (8) and

said inner wall area (24) so as to enable a sliding
movement of said endoscope shaft (8) relative to said inner

wall area (24). 
A device according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 a
vegetable oil is used as lubricant.
An endoscopic device comprising an endoscope shaft (8),

characterized by
 a device for moving said endoscope shaft
(8) according to one of claims 1 to 8.
