<ABSTRACT>
The air-cushion deflection device (2) includes no movable piece capable of offering a rolling resistance, causing vibrations or requiring regular maintenance. The deflection device is principally constituted by a hollow deflection element (20), supplied with compressed air (10), the latter escaping via a plurality of radial holes (26) arranged on a surface portion of the deflection element so as to form an air cushion between this surface portion and a flexible tape (3) which is turned back through a certain angle by the said device. Given its simplicity of operation, its low cost and its performance levels, a device of this type may advantageously be used for a number of applications, but it is particularly well adapted for equipping an accummulator (11) of a paper tape linked to a machine for connecting two paper tapes requiring stopping of the tape for connection.
