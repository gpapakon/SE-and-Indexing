<ABSTRACT>
An adapter (14) for use with a rifle mountable grenade launcher unit (12) to form a stand alone hand held grenade launcher. The adapter (14) includes a rod (22, 24) to be inserted into a rifle barrel receiving hole (58) of grenade launcher unit and a recoil surface (52) that can be located, at least partially, behind the barrel bore of the grenade launcher unit (12). The recoil surface intersects the center axis of the grenade launcher unit barrel bore such that recoil after firing can be absorbed in line with the barrel bore to thereby minimize muzzle climb.

 HAND HELD GRENADE LAUNCHERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention10The present invention relates to grenade launchers and, mo particularly, to a system and method to convert a rif mountable grenade launcher into a hand held stand alo grenade launcher.152. Prior ArtThe M79 grenade launcher rifle was the first weapon to co into service which was specifically designed to fire sp20 stabilized grenades (40mm). Soon after, in 1969, the M2 grenade launcher was adopted as the successor to the M7 This design utilized the capabilities of the M79 in a compa unit that attached under the grip area of the M16 servi rifle. The M203 has been generally replacing the M79 on a o25 for one basis. However, there is still a current need for stand alone grenade launcher rifle. As time goes by, locati replacement parts for the M79 is becoming exceeding difficult. Because of this, long term service life of t current inventory of the M79 grenade launchers cannot30 guaranteed.U.S. Patent 3,279,114 to Lewis et al. discloses a grena~Â» launcher that is mountable to the underside of a rifle at i barrel. The launcher has a rear mount of generally U-shap cross-section with an open top slot. U.S. Patent 3,507,067 t Into discloses a similar rifle mounted grenade launcher 

 Another rifle mountable grenade launcher, the M203, is als known in the prior art. Hand held stand alone grenad launchers are also known in the prior art including the M7 grenade launcher. Steyr Defence Products of Austria sell M203 type grenade launchers having a folding stock pistol uni without a rifle. U.S. Patent 4,733,489 to Kurak discloses method and apparatus for reconfiguring an automatic rifle fo quick attachment and detachment of a grenade launcher.The present invention is in regard to an adapter system tha when attached to an unmodified M203 launcher converts it int a stand alone shoulder fired or hand held pistol fired grenad launcher. It is an objective of the present invention t provide a new and improved attachment for a rifle mountabl grenade launcher unit to use the grenade launcher unit as hand held stand alone grenade launcher.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe foregoing problems are overcome and other advantages are provided by a new and improved system and method to convert a rifle mountable grenade launcher into a hand held stand alone grenade launcher.In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a grenade launcher is provided comprising a receiver adapter, a launcher unit, and means for fixedly attaching the launcher unit
