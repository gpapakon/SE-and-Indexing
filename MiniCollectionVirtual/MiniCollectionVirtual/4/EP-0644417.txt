<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for detecting checks in the sidewall of a 
translucent container (22) that includes a light source (24) 

for illuminating an elongated strip of the container sidewall 
parallel to the central axis of the container in such a way 

that illumination rays are incident at any point of the strip 
from multiple differing angles. A camera (50) is positioned 

externally of the container for receiving light reflected by 
checks in the illuminated strip, and electronic circuitry (52) 

is coupled to the camera for detecting checks in the container as 
a function of such reflected light. Since the light rays at 

any point in the elongated illuminated strip on the container 
sidewall are incident from multiple differing angles, planar 

checks and split seams in the container sidewall that are not 
precisely vertical in orientation will have a greater chance 

of reflecting light energy from the source onto the camera.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus and
method for detecting checks and or split seams in a
translucent container, according to the preamble of claim 1.In the manufacture of translucent containers such as
clear or colored glass bottles, various types of checks or
other commercial variations can occur in the sidewalls of
the containers. For example, variations known as split seams
and vertical checks may be present in the sidewall of a
container. These split seams and vertical cheeks are mirror-like
reflective cracks that lie in a plane and extend
generally radially from the longitudinal axis of the
container. Many devices have been proposed for detecting
such variations.An apparatus referred to above (GB-A-2133538 = US-A-4,384,469)
is a device for detecting split seams and
vertical checks in the sidewall of a glass container. A
light source is positioned to one side of the container to
direct light energy onto the container wall from a direction
perpendicular and lateral to the container axis. The light
source comprises an incandescent bulb and a cylindrical lens
for projecting an image of the bulb filament onto the
container sidewall in an elongated narrow tightly focused
strip parallel to the container axis. A linear array camera
is positioned to receive an image of the illuminated portion
of the container from a direction perpendicular to the
illumination and container axes. As the container is held in
position and rotated about its axis, a radial planar check
will eventually be rotated into a position to reflect light
from the source to the detector. Thus, the vertical check or
split seam is detected as a bright spot on what is otherwise
a normally gray or dark background viewed by the detector. 
(Directional terms such as "vertical" assume vertical
orientation of the container axis with the mouth opening
upwardly, as is typical in the container inspection art.)Although the device disclosed in the noted patent has
enjoyed substantial commercial success, further improvements
remain desirable. In particular, the device disclosed in the
noted patent is limited in its ability to detect checks that
are not precisely vertical and parallel to the container
axis. That is, if a check is non-vertical, light incident on
the check will be reflected by the check but not necessarily
incident on the camera.US-A-3,588,258 shows fiber-optic bundles which illuminate
an article from the inner side thereof, whereas receiving
optical bundles are arranged on the opposite side of the
wall to be inspected.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for detecting checks and/or split seams (64)
in a translucent container (22) having a sidewall and a

central axis comprising:

a source (30) of light for illuminating an elongated
narrow strip (47) of the container sidewall parallel to

the container axis (23),
a camera (50) positioned externally of the container
(22) for receiving light reflected by checks (64) in the

illuminated strip (47) of the container (22) along a
reflection axis (51) preferably perpendicular to the

axis of illumination from said light source, and
means (52) responsive to said camera for detecting
checks in the container as a function of such reflected

light,

characterized in that
said light source (30) is connected to a single
linear array (36) of individual light sources formed by

individual fiber-optic elements (38) having ends which
function in effect as said individual light sources from

which light rays (39) emerge which are focused toward
said strip, wherein said light rays (39) illuminating

said strip (47) are incident at any point of said strip
from multiple angles essentially coplanar with each

other and with the strip.
The apparatus set forth in claim 1 wherein said camera
(50) comprises a linear array of light sensitive

elements optically parallel to the container axis. 
The apparatus set forth in claim 2 further comprising:

means (26) for rotating the container (22) about its

central axis (23), and means (52) for scanning said
linear array of light sensitive elements at increments

of container rotation.
The apparatus set forth in any preceding claim
wherein said array (36) of fiber-optic elements (38) is

in the form of a fiber-optic ribbon which has a first
end coupled to said light source (30) and a second end

disposed optically parallel to said illuminated strip
(47) of the container sidewall.
The apparatus set forth in any of claims 1 to 4
wherein said array (36) of fiber optic elements (38)

forms a fiber optic bundle (34) which is fanned into a
plane near those fiber ends which form said individual

light sources.
The apparatus set forth in any of claims 1 to 5
wherein a cylindrical lens (42) is provided for focusing

light from the ends of said fiber optic elements (38) in
said narrow strip (47).
The apparatus set forth in claim 4 wherein said fiber-optic
ribbon has a dimension parallel to the central

axis (23) of the container (22) at least as great as the
dimension of the illuminated strip (47) of the container

(22) parallel to such axis (23).
The apparatus set forth in any of claims 1 to 7 
wherein means (48) is provided for adjustably

positioning said light source (30) with respect to the
container (22) and camera (50).
A method of inspecting translucent containers (22),
comprising the steps of:


(a) producing illumination rays (39) essentially
contained in a plane parallel to the container axis

from fiber-optic ends (38) which are arranged in a
single linear array (36) so as to illuminate an

elongated strip (47) of the sidewall of the
container in such a way that the illumination rays

(39) diverge and intersect and are incident at any
point within the strip (47) from multiple angles,
(b) directing light energy reflected by checks and split
seams (64) in the illuminated strip (47) onto a

(c) detecting checks in the container sidewall as a

in which the individual optical fibers (38) are disposed

in a linear array (36), the end faces thereof being
optically parallel to the illuminated strip (47).

additional step of:


(d) rotating the container (22) about its central
axis (23) at an orientation in which such axis is
