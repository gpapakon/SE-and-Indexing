<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for automatically mounting and/or demounting flexible printing plates on printing machines. Setting out from the object of compensating the phase offset of the impression lines relative to the leading edge of the sheet and the leading edge of the printing plate during automatic mounting and/or demounting of printing plates over the sheet path, at least one cylinder is designed to be adjustable in relation to the sheet-conveying and/or printing plate-conveying apparatus for compensating the phase offset of the impression lines relative to the leading edge of the printing plate and the leading edge of the sheet in a device for automatically mounting and/or demounting flexible printing plates on/from at least one printing forme cylinder of a printing machine provided with a plate gripper system by sheet conveying means, present on the printing machine and containing sheet-conveying cylinders fitted with gripper systems, and an intermediate cylinder provided with an auxiliary gripper system.

Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates (4) 
onto or from at least one print cylinder (8) equipped with a plate gripper system (9) and 

forming part of a printing press by means of the sheet feeding mechanism already 
present on the printing press and comprising a sheet guide roller (13;14) equipped with 

gripper systems (5) and by means of an intermediate roller (6) equipped with an 
auxiliary gripper system (7) thereby characterised that at least one gripper system (5;7;9) 

is designed to be capable of travel to compensate for phase displacement (p) of the print 
application lines (19) in relation to the leading edge of the printing plate (4.1) and the 

leading edge of the sheet (18.1) relative to the direction of advance of the sheet and/or 
printing plate. 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 1 thereby characterised that the auxiliary gripper system (7) 

incorporated in the intermediate roller (6) is capable of being displaced to an extent 
equivalent to the phase displacement (p) of the print insertion lines (19) in relation to the 

printing plate leading edge (4.1) and the sheet leading edge (18.1) along the direction of 
printing plate advance and that the gripper system (5) of the print cylinder (14) is 

designed to be capable of displacement along a radial path (22) within the print cylinder 
channel (21) to an extent equivalent to the phase displacement (p). 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 1 thereby characterised that the plate gripper system (9) on the print 

cylinder (8) is designed to travel radially as far as and below the print cylinder periphery 
(27) of the print cylinder (8) and the auxiliary gripper system (7) on the intermediate 

roller (6) is designed to swing away within the intermediate roller channel (15) in the 
direction of advance of the printing plate along a path radial to the intermediate cylinder 

to an extent equivalent to the phase displacement (p).  
 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 1 thereby characterised that the print cylinder (8) is capable of being 

displaced in the direction of advance of the printing plate. 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in one of the above Claims thereby characterised that the cylinder (14;6;8) can 

be displaced in the normal direction of rotation when introducing flexible printing plates 

(4). 
Device for the automatic insertion and/or extraction of flexible printing plates (4) as 
described in one of the above Claims thereby characterised that the cylinder (14;6;8) can 

be displaced in a direction counter to the normal direction of rotation when extracting 
flexible printing plates. 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 1 above thereby characterised that a limiter rod (25) is fitted onto a 

flange (40) attached to one end-face of the print roller, intermediate roller, or print 
cylinder (14;6;8), and a radial groove (26) is positioned on the corresponding cylinder 

drive wheel (21;23;28), the end-face and the cylinder drive wheel being detachably 
connected by means of a commonly available device, and the flange (40) linked 

mechanically to an adjuster. 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 7 above thereby characterised that the adjuster consists of a drive 

pinion (30) mechanically engaged in a toothed wheel (29) attached to a flange (40). 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 7 thereby characterised that the adjuster consists of a roller spacing 

lever (33) comprising a cam roller (34) mechanically engaged with an introducible curve 
(35) mounted between the flange (40) and the drive-wheel.  

 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 7 thereby characterised that the adjuster consists of a working 

cylinder (38) positioned between the flange (40) and the drive wheel. 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 7 thereby characterised that the means of adjustment comprises a 

triple-wheeled drive (39) operated through a working cylinder (38) and positioned 
between the flange (40) and the drive wheel.
