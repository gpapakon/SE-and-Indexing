<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming a contact window in an oxide layer formed on a 
semiconductor substrate is disclosed. The method comprises the steps of: implanting 

a dopant into the oxide layer, followed by isotropic and anisotropic etching of a 
window area of the oxide. The steps form. the contact window in the oxide layer at 

the window area permitting a sub-micron linewidth contact layer to be formed within 
the contact window. The invention avoids the formation of re-entrant window wall 

edges in the oxide layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to the field of semiconductor processing, and 
more particularly, to a method for improved step coverage in window processing of 
silicon components. The present invention addresses a subset of the large number of operations 
required to fabricate a silicon semiconductor component. The present disclosure will 
thus concentrate on only the steps that are relevant to the present invention. Modern VLSI devices incorporate multiple levels of metallization. The metal 
layers are separated by an insulator, typically silicon dioxide (SiO₂). In order to make 
electrical contacts between the metal layers, it is necessary to pattern contact holes 
(windows or vias) prior to the deposition of the top metal. the contact holes are first 
defined by photolithography using a resist later deposited on the silicon dioxide film. 
With the resist as a mask, the windows are made by etching the silicon dioxide at the 
exposed regions. In past generations of technology (minimum feature sizes larger than 
about 2 microns), wet etching of the oxide with HF solutions could be used. As the 
feature sizes have shrunk below 1 micron, wet etching is no longer a viable alternative, 
since it cannot provide the tight dimensional control and process reproducibility 
required for sub micron windows. Dry etching methods are particularly suitable for VLSI processing because of 
their ability to transfer resist patterns with high fidelity. (See, for example, C.J. 
Mogab, "Dry Etching", VLSI Technology, Edited by S.M. Sze, Ch. 8, p. 303, McGraw-Hill 
(1983).) Basically, dry etching of silicon dioxide is performed by using a plasma 
to create CFx (x≦3) radicals which react with SiO₂ in preference to Si. The reaction 
products subsequently desorb from the surface, with the overall reaction being initiated 
and/or accelerated by energetic ions extracted from the plasma. In terms of  
 
determining the type of profile obtained in a window with dry etching, a very 
important parameter to consider is bias. Bias is defined as the difference in lateral 
dimension between the etched image and the mask image. A zero-bias process 
produces a vertical edge profile coincident with the edge of the mask. The pattern is 
transferred in this case with perfect fidelity. This represents the extreme of anisotropic 
etching. When the edge rate is independent of direction, that is, the vertical and 
horizontal etch rates are equal, the edge profiles appears as a quarter-circle after 
etching has been carried to completion. In
