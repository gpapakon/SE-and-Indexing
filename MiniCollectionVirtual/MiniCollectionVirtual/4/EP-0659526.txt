<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a pattern shaped article 
includes the steps of forming at least two different 

courses (12, 13) of dry particles overlaid on a base 
surface (10); using an air flow controller (20) having 

either a suction port (21) or a blow port (28) or both a 
suction port and a blow port to effect an air flow to form 

a cavity corresponding to a pattern expression in at least 
a lower dry particle course (12) by removing a portion of 

the lower dry particle course under control of at least 
one parameter among air pressure, air flow rate, air flow 

speed, air flow direction, air flow pulsation, air flow 
intermittence, suction port size, blow port size, suction 

port position and blow port position; collapsing particles 
of an upper dry particle course (13) of a different type 

of dry particles into the cavity and allowing the 
particles to set into an integral mass.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing
patterned shaped articles, more particularly to such a
method for producing patterned concrete shaped articles,
patterned artificial stone shaped articles, patterned raw
products for sintering into ceramic shaped articles,
patterned ceramic shaped articles, patterned metal shaped
articles, patterned impasto shaped articles, patterned
plastic shaped articles, patterned shaped foodstuffs and
the like, using an air flow controller.Up to now the only way available for providing a
part of a surface, such as of paving blocks, with a
pattern indicating a pedestrian crossing, a stop sign or
other such traffic sign or for providing the entire
surface of the blocks with a pattern has been to paint the
surface with a coating material such as paint or to inlay
the desired pattern.Since the patterns painted on a part or all of
the surface of paving blocks are exposed to abrasion such
as from the footwear of pedestrians walking on the blocks,
and the tires of vehicles driving over them, they quickly
wear off and have to be redone at frequent intervals. The
amount of labor involved in this work is considerable.
Where the pattern is formed by inlaying, the work itself
is troublesome and very costly.The present inventors previously proposed a
method and an apparatus for producing various types of
patterned shaped articles with surface patterns formed by 
pattern courses of prescribed thickness, by using an air
flow controller and computer control (European Patent
Application No. 94306199.4 (= EP-A-0 642 899) corresponding to Japanese
Patent Application No. 5-229643).The present invention is an improvement on the
above method, and has as its object a method for
producing, readily and at high speed, shaped articles
having complex and highly sophisticated patterns of a
prescribed thickness.The invention provides a method of producing a
patterned shaped article comprising the steps of forming
at least two different courses of dry particles overlaid
on a base surface; using an air flow controller having
either a suction port or a blow port or both a suction
port and a blow port to effect an air flow to form a
cavity corresponding to a pattern expression in at least
a lower dry particle course by removing a portion of the
lower dry particle course under control of at least one
parameter among air pressure, air flow rate, air flow
speed, air flow direction, air flow pulsation, air flow
intermittence, suction port size, blow port size, suction
port position and blow port position;
