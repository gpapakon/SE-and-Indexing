(L) defined by the thickness centre line of the 
carcass (6) comprise a tread crown part (Q1) beneath 

the belt (7), a pair of upper sidewall parts (15)

parts (15), the tread crown part (Q1) having a first 
single radius of curvature R1, the upper sidewall

third single radius of curvature R3, the third

0.003 to 0.03 times the first radius of curvature 
R1, the third radius of curvature R3 being in the  

 
range of from 0.05 to 0.5 times the second radius of 

curvature R2, the axial position of the boundary 
(Po) between the tread crown part (Q1) and each 

shoulder part (Q3) being between the axial position 
of each edge (7e) of the belt (7) and a position 

which is 20 mm axially inward thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre 
having an improved carcass line which is capable of 
reducing the transmission of vibration during 
running and thereby reducing road noise. Tyres are vibrated during running by roughness of 
the road surface, and the vibrations are transmitted 
from the tyre tread portion to the car body through 
the tyre sidewall and bead portions and the wheel to 
generate so called road noise whose peak lies around 
200-250Hz. In a radial tyre provided with a stiff belt, e.g. a 
steel belt, road noise is remarkably large. In order to reduce the road noise, the tread 
rigidity has been decreased by decreasing the tread 
rubber hardness and/or belt cord modulus. Further, 
it has been proposed to provide inside a tyre a 
vibration damper layer made of a foamed rubber. However, when the tread rigidity is lowered, the 
cornering force is inevitably decreased which 
deteriorates steering performance.  
 On the other hand, when a damper layer is disposed 
in the tyre, the dynamic balance of the tyre is 
liable to be disturbed, and the ride comfort is 
deteriorated. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a pneumatic tyre in which, road noise can 
be reduced without lowering the tread rigidity and 
without using an additional damper material. According to the present invention, a 
pneumatic tyre comprises a tread portion, a pair of 
axially spaced bead portions with a bead core 
therein, a pair of sidewall portions, a carcass 
extending between the bead portions, and a belt 
disposed radially outside the carcass and inside the 
tread portion, wherein in a meridian section of the 
tyre when mounted on a standard rim but not 
inflated, the carcass line defined by the thickness 
centre line of the carcass comprises a tread crown 
part beneath the belt, a pair of upper sidewall 
parts radially outward of the maximum carcass width 
position, and a pair of shoulder parts between the 
tread crown part and the upper sidewall parts, the 
tread crown part having a first single radius of 
curvature R1, the upper sidewall parts having a  
 
second single radius of curvature R2, and the 
shoulder parts having a third single radius of 
curvature R3, the third radius of curvature R3 being 
in the range of from 0.003 to 0.03 times the first 
radius of curvature R1, the third radius of 
curvature R3 being in the range of from 0.05 to 0.5 
times the second radius of curvature R2, the axial 
position of the boundary between the tread crown 
part and each shoulder part
