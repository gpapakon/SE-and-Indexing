<ABSTRACT>
A closure (1) for sacks, bags or the like containers (3) with non-rigid walls. The containers (3) are to be pressurised. The closure (1) comprises a filling nozzle (5) with a valve (7) and a flange (10). The flange (10) has a cylindrical portion (11) and a plate-shaped portion (12). The plate-shaped portion (12) of the flange (10) is attached to the container (3). The filling nozzle (5) may be caused to sealingly engage the flange (10) by means of a snap connection (14), whereby the closure (1) is either completely open or closed. The snap connection (14) either retains the filling nozzle (5) in firm and tight engagement with the flange (10) or releases the filling nozzle (5) in relation to the flange (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a closure for sacks, bags or the like containers 
with non-rigid walls, said containers to be pressurised and said closure 
comprising a filling nozzle with a valve and a separate flange having a 
cylindrical portion and a plate-shaped portion where said flange is adapted 
to be attached to the container through said plate-shaped portion. Valves are known for sacks or bags to be pressurised, for instance with 
air, the valve comprising a flange and a threaded connection. The screwed 
connection has to be detached from the flange, if the valve is to be 
opened and tightened if the bag or sack is to maintain the air pressure. 
The valve per se can be further secured by means of a separate plug. Such 
valve constructions are known inter alia from Swedish published specification 
No. 425.233 and PCT publication No. WO 91/10598. The object of the invention is to provide a closure which is either opened 
or closed, and which closure can be completely opened by one single operation 
to obtain a high deflation rate and which closure equally can be 
closed by one single operation, so that the closure is either completely 
opened or completely closed both visibly and functionally. According to the present invention this object is achieved with a closure as set out in the introduction, 
and in which, furthermore, the filling 
nozzle is hingedly connected to a lower portion which is adapted to be pivotally connected 
to the outer side of the cylindrical portion of the flange by means 
of a first snap connection, and the filling nozzle is adapted to be  
 
locked in sealing engagement with the flange by means of a second snap 
connection engaging between the filling nozzle and the lower portion. As a result, the filling nozzle can be connected to the flange, and in this 
position it can enter the closed or the completely open state. The pivotal 
securing implies that the filling nozzle can always be turned into a position 
in which it is easiest to handle, and the securing of the filling nozzle to the 
flange by means of the second snap connection implies that the closure 
can be opened completely so as to allow a fast outflow of air from the 
sack or be closed for the filling in of air through the filling nozzle or be 
completely closed by means of a separate plug. In a preferred embodiment of the closure according to the invention 
a seal is arranged between a valve holder placed in the filling nozzle 
and the interior face of the cylindrical portion of the flange. As a result, a 
suitable

<CLAIMS>
A closure (1) for sacks, bags or the like containers (3) with non-rigid 
walls, said containers (3) to be pressurised and said closure comprising a 

filling nozzle (5) with a valve (7) and a separate flange (10) having a cylindrical 
portion (11) and a plate-shaped portion (12) where said flange is 

adapted to be attached to the container (3) through said plate-shaped 
portion 
characterised
 in that the filling nozzle (5) 
is hingedly connected to a lower portion (47), which is adapted to be pivotally connected to the outer 

side of the cylindrical portion of the flange (10) by means of a first snap connection 
(49), and in that the filling nozzle (5) is adapted to be locked in 

sealing engagement with the flange (10) by means of a second snap 
connection (14) engaging between the filling nozzle (5) and the lower 

portion (47). 
A closure as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised
 in that a 
sealing ring (16) is arranged between a valve holder (18) placed in the 

filling nozzle (5) and the interior face (10) of the cylindrical portion (11) of 
the flange. 
A closure as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised
 in that a 
protrusion (20) is arranged on the valve holder (18) of the filling nozzle (5), 

said protrusion engaging the flange (10) at the transition between the 
cylindrical portion (11) and the plate-shaped portion (12). 
A closure as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised
 in that the 
position of the protrusion (20) and of the second snap connections (14) 

essentially defines a plane (22) intersecting a second plane (24) essentially 
defined by the contact border (26,27) of the sealing ring (17) to the valve 

holder (18) and the flange (10), respectively. 
A closure as claimed in claim 3 or 4, 
characterised
 in that  
 

the second snap connection (14) comprises at least one snap hook (30, 
31) arranged diametrally opposite the protrusion (20) when seen in relation 

to the flange (10). 
A closure as claimed in one or more of the claims 3 to 5, 
characterised
 
in that the protrusion (20) abuts an area of a circumferential 

recess (33) provided in the flange (10) between the cylindrical portion (11) 
and the plate-shaped portion (12). 
A closure as claimed in one or more of claims 2 to 6, 
characterised
 
in that the valve holder (18) is provided with a bayonet lock 

(37) arranged on the side (35) facing away from the flange (10) when the 
closure is closed for a gripping coupling (38), wherein the line of engagement 

(40) is arranged as a radial (41) extension when seen in relation to 
the flange (10). 
A closure as claimed in claim 7, 
characterised
 in that at 
least one of the protrusions (43) of the bayonet lock (37) is provided with 

an opening (45) facing the protrusion (20) on the valve holder (18). 
A closure as claimed in claim 8, 
characterised
 in that the 
area of the opening (45) is larger than the projected area of the protrusion 

(20) on the opening (45).
