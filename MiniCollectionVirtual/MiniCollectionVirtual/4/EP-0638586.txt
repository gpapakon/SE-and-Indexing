<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a novel method for
producing 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azidothymidine, AZT,
zidovudine), which is useful as an anti-viral agent, and its
related compounds and also provides intermediates for the
production thereof.It has been reported that 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine has
a strong anti-viral activity against human immunodeficiency
viruses (HIVs) and is noticeably effective for curing
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (R. Yarchoan et
al., The Lancet, 1 (8481), pp. 575-580, March 15, 1986). At
present, therefore, the compound is used for curing AIDS and
AIDS-related complications (ARC).For producing 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine on a laboratory
scale, there are known two methods. One uses thymidine
as a starting material and introduces an azido group into its
3'-position (R. Glinski et al., J. Chem. Soc. D, (15), pp.
915-916, 1970; R. Glinski et al., J. Org. Chem., 38 (25), pp.
4299-4305, 1973); and the other consists in linking the sugar moiety
into which an azide group has been introduced to the base
moiety of a nucleic acid (N. Dyatkina et al., Bioorg. Khim.,
12 (8), pp. 1048-1053, 1986; G. Fleet et al., Tetrahedron
Lett., 28 (31), pp. 3615-3618, 1987; G. Fleet et al.,
Tetrahedron, 44 (2), pp. 625-636, 1988; C. Chu et al.,
Tetrahedron Lett., 29 (42), pp. 5349-5352, 1988). The former
method may be put into industrial application but has the
problem of requiring thymidine, which is high-priced and
is difficult to obtain on industrial scale, as the starting
material. According to the latter method, the production of
the sugar moiety into which an azido group has been
introduced is difficult and, in addition, both α- and
β-isomers are produced when the saccharide moiety is linked
to the base moiety of a nucleic acid and these must
be separated from each other. For these reasons, it is
difficult to say that the latter method is industrially
useful.Several uridine derivatives have already been known-to be
useful as antiviral agents or as intermediates in the
synthesis of other biologically active nucleosides. Thus US-A-3
870 700 discloses 2-halogen-2-deoxy-5-substituted
uridines, wherein the 5-substituent may e.g. be halogen, a
thiocyanate or a mercapto group.Chemical Abstracts, vol. 95, no. 13, 1981, Abstract no.
115951 discloses 2'-halo-2-deoxy-5-fluorouridine and 3,5-di-O-benzoyl
derivatives thereof.DD-A-279 247 discloses a process for producing 1-β-D-allofuranosylthymine
nucleosides having a hydroxy substituent in 2-position
and a fluorine substituent in 3-position of
