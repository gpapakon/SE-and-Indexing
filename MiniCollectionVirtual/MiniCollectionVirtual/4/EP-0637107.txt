<ABSTRACT>
In optical systems the wavelength of the signal light is usually fixed at 1300 nm or 1550 nm, since at these wavelengths the optical waveguides (fibres) have attenuation minima. This signal light is detected using special photodiodes which are sensitive to this wavelength range. These photodiodes are, however, expensive, with the result that it is desirable for it to be possible to use simple and inexpensive photodiodes, for example based on silicon, for this purpose. An optical system having a fibre-optic amplifier is specified, in which the fibre-optic amplifier converts the signal light to be transmitted, having a first wavelength ( lambda 1), into signal light having a second wavelength ( lambda 2), the signal light having the second wavelength ( lambda 2) being the pumping light which is not absorbed in the fibre-optic amplifier. An opto-electrical converter 4 is designed so that it is sensitive only to the wavelength ( lambda 2) of the non-absorbed pumping light. The fibre-optic amplifier is here used as a wavelength converter.
