<ABSTRACT>
Air is cryogenically separated to produce an oxygen 
product with purity less than 98% and a nitrogen product in 

a distillation column system with a low pressure column 
(24), a medium pressure column (22) and a high pressure 

column (20). Oxygen-enriched streams, (140, 162) from the 
high and medium pressure columns (20, 22) are fed to the 

medium and low pressure columns (22, 24) respectively and 
at least a portion (146) of the high pressure nitrogen 

overhead (144) is condensed by heat exchange (28) against a 
liquid stream in the medium pressure column (22) or the 

high pressure column bottoms (142). The condensed high 
pressure nitrogen overhead (160) is used to provide reflux 

to the high pressure column (20). Gaseous oxygen (186) of 
less than 98% purity is obtained from the low pressure 

column (24) and nitrogen (172) in an amount of at least 35% 
of feed air flow is obtained from the high pressure column 

(20) and/or the medium pressure column (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cryogenic process 
for the separation of air into its constituent components 
and the integration of that cryogenic air separation 
process with a gas turbine power generation system. The production of oxygen and nitrogen from atmospheric 
air is a power intensive process. It is always desirable 
to reduce the power consumption of such processes. It is 
particularly true for large plants, when both oxygen and a 
large fraction of the nitrogen are demanded at pressures 
much greater than that of the atmosphere. Example of such 
an application are the Integrated Gasification Combined 
Cycle and the Integrated Gasification Humid Air Turbine 
electrical power generation systems. In these systems, 
high pressure oxygen is needed for gasification of a 
carbonaceous feedstock, e.g., coal, and high pressure 
nitrogen can be fed to the gas turbine power generation 
system to maximize power output, control NOx formation 
and/or increase its efficiency. The objective of the 
present invention is to reduce power consumption of 
cryogenic air separation plants providing products in such 
applications. EP-A-0556516 proposes a dual reboiler cycle with the 
lower pressure column working at pressures significantly 
higher than that of the atmosphere. The dual reboiler 
cycle results in a significant power saving over a 
conventional Linde type double column system. This power 
saving for the dual reboiler cycle is due to the 
availability of a higher pressure nitrogen stream directly 
from the cold box. The dual reboiler cycle is suitable for  
 
cases in which all of the products of the air separation 
unit are delivered as products at pressures equal to or 
higher than those directly available from the cold box. 
When not all of the nitrogen is needed at such pressures, a 
stream of the nitrogen by-product has to be expanded to a 
lower pressure, typically at a low temperature. The 
expansion of a large gas flow with a low expansion ratio 
usually makes such a system inefficient. On the other hand, a triple column cycle was 
introduced by Latimer for the high-pressure-air liquid 
plant (Chemical Engineering Progress, Vol. 63, No. 2, pp. 
35-59, 1967). The triple column cycle was designed for 
complete oxygen recovery as liquid product and nearly 
complete argon recovery. The cycle has a feed air pressure 
of 140 psig (10.7 bara; 1.07 MPa) or higher, since the top 
of the high pressure column is thermally integrated with 
the bottom end of the medium pressure column, and top end 
of

(a) using three distillation columns consisting of a 
low pressure column, a medium pressure column which 

operates at a pressure higher than the low pressure
