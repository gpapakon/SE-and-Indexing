<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for cutting grooves in
concrete. More particularly, this invention relates to
concrete groove cutters which travel along the surface of wet
or green concrete and use a rotating cutting blade to cut a
groove into the surface of the concrete.Concrete, when poured, is normally viscous, and thus
flows and spreads to fill the area it is poured into. Once
poured, the concrete will begin to harden in a curing process,
until it reaches its typical rock hard state. Between the
time the concrete is poured and when the concrete hardens, the
concrete will normally be worked or finished to ensure that
the surface is smooth and even or has some other discrete
surface finish and appearance.Normally, grooves are cut in the concrete to aid in
relieving stresses in the concrete which occur as the concrete
shrinks during curing. If grooves are placed only in the
surface of the concrete, the grooves provide a weakened plane
in which the concrete can crack, thus providing a predicted
location of cracks. If the grooves are not provided, the
concrete will randomly crack.Grooves are also often inserted into the concrete surface
after it has hardened substantially. This is normally
accomplished with large concrete cutting devices which use
heavy saws with rotating abrasive blades, and which use water
as a coolant to prevent the blade from burning up. These
devices are typically very large and heavy, and use large
diameter cutting blades varying from 10 to 24 inches (25.4 to 61.0 cm) in
diameter. The resistance on the large blades is so great that
the saw will cut a curved path. Sometimes the blade is angled
slightly about a vertical axis to cause the saw to cut in a
straighter line. Other saws cannot be used until the concrete
has hardened substantially, otherwise the finish of the
concrete will be marred, the water lubricant will wash the
concrete away, and the cutting blade will spall, chip, tear,
crack and ravel (hereinafter the term "ravel" or "ravelling" 
shall include ravelling, chipping, tearing, cracking and spalling) the concrets surface
along the groove. The large water lubricated cuffing machines which cut the concrete
surface after it has substantially hardened often groove the surface after the concrete
has experienced significant stresses and cracking. These large machines will also often
ravel the surface adjacent the groove.Several light weight concrete cutting machines have been developed to cut
concrete while it is still curing. To reduce the possibility of marring the surface
