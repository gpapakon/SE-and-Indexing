<ABSTRACT>
A torque wrench comprises a body member (2) containing a 
piston-cylinder assembly (10) to the piston of which is 

secured a shuttle member (14) reciprocable with the piston 
within the body member (2), and a housing (22) mounted on the 

body member (2) and including a drive member (28) pivotal 
about an axis (P) and having a neck portion (34) radially 

remote from the pivot axis (P). The shuttle member (14) has 
a cylindrical bore (16) therein the central longitudinal axis 

of which extends parallel with the pivot axis of the drive 
member (28), said bore (16) housing a cylindrical drive pin 

(18) in which is formed a transverse bore (20), the neck 
portion (34) of the drive member (28) being received within 

said bore (20) whereby, on linear movement of the piston, the 
drive member (28) is pivoted about the pivot axis (P) with 

the neck portion (34) of the drive member (28) undergoing 
guided sliding movement in the bore (20) of the drive pin 

(18), and the drive pin (18) pivoting about the central 
longitudinal axis of the bore (16) in the shuttle member 

(14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hydraulic torque wrenches used 
for rotating mechanical components, for example for 
tightening or loosening nuts, bolts and screws, and more 
particularly to wrenches capable of providing a 
substantially constant torque and of maintaining such a 
torque over a relatively long stroke of the associated 
piston. Our published European specification no. 0382408 
discloses a constant torque wrench of this type which 
includes a body member incorporating a hydraulic piston-cylinder 
assembly, and a housing incorporating a ratchet 
drive mechanism. The drive mechanism includes a pivotal 
drive lever provided with a cylindrical neck portion remote 
from the pivot axis of the lever, said neck portion being 
slidably received within the cylindrical bore of a spherical 
bearing member linearly movable with the piston of the 
piston-cylinder assembly. The provision of the spherical bearing member, which is 
preferably housed within a cylindrical shuttle member 
secured to, to be movable with, the piston, enables the 
linear movement of the piston to be translated into angular 
movement of the drive lever in a manner which achieves 
substantially constant torque throughout the length of the 
piston stroke, while at the same time the spherical nature 
of the bearing member, and the associated substantially 
universal movement it can undergo, accommodates the 
torsional and bending forces transmitted through the body  
 
member during normal operation. The above-described tool is particularly suited to dual 
purpose use for both conventional and limited access 
situations. For conventional use, a housing accommodating a square 
drive is provided to which can be attached a variety of 
different sockets. For limited access use, the housing with the square 
drive is replaced by a low profile housing incorporating a 
socket of the desired dimensions. Thus it will be appreciated that the housings should be 
easily interchangeable such that the exchange can be made 
without the need for specialised tooling, holding devices and 
the like. Although removal of a housing from a body member is 
readily achieved and attachment of a housing to a body 
member can be achieved relatively easily with care and 
experience, situations have arisen whereby care has not been 
exercised and damage has occurred. Prior to assembly, it is necessary to locate the 
spherical bearing member in a position whereby the bore 
therethrough is positioned to receive therein the neck 
portion of the drive lever as the housing

A hydraulic torque wrench comprising a body member 
(2) in which is linearly reciprocable the piston of a 

hydraulic piston-cylinder assembly (10), a shuttle member 
(14) secured to the piston to undergo guided linear 

reciprocal movement with the piston within the body member 
(2), and a housing (22) in which are contained a drive member 

(28) pivotal by said piston-cylinder assembly (10) about an 
axis (P) radially spaced from the line of action (X-Y) of the 

piston, said drive member (28) including a neck portion (34) 
radially remote from said pivot axis (P), holding means (30) 

carried by the drive member (28) to be rotatable co-axially 
with said drive member (28), and a ratchet connection (32) 

between the drive member (28) and the holding means (30), 

characterised in that
 a cylindrical bore (16) is formed in 
the shuttle member (14) the central longitudinal axis of 

which extends parallel with the pivot axis of the drive 
member (28), and a correspondingly-cylindrical drive pin (18) 

is located within said bore (16) to be rotatable therein 
about said central longitudinal axis, the drive pin (18) 

having a transverse bore (20) formed therein slidably 
received within which is the neck portion (34) of the drive 

member (28), the arrangement being such that, on linear 
movement of the piston and attached shuttle member (14), the 

drive member (28) is pivoted about the pivot axis (P) with 
the neck portion (34) of the drive member (28) undergoing 

guided sliding movement in the bore (20) of the drive pin 
(18), and the drive pin (18) pivoting about the central  

 
longitudinal axis of the bore (16) in the shuttle member 

(14). 
A torque wrench as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
neck portion (34) is of cylindrical shape and the bore (20) 

within the drive pin (18) is of generally oval shape in 
transverse section with the minor diameter thereof extending 

parallel with the pivot axis of the drive member (28) and 
being of a length equal to the diameter of the neck portion 

(34), the length of the major diameter exceeding the 
diameter of said neck portion (34). 
A torque wrench as claimed in claim 2 in which the 
longitudinal centreline of the bore (20) through the drive 

pin (18) is offset from the longitudinal centreline of the 
drive pin (24) to that side of the longitudinal centreline of 

the drive pin (34) remote from the piston of the piston-cylinder 
assembly (10). 
A torque wrench as claimed in any one of claims 1 to

cylindrical shape and is reciprocal within a corresponding 
cylindrical bore (4) formed within the body member (2). 
A torque wrench as claimed in any one of claims 1 to

and includes a one end extent (6) which is externally splined 
to receive thereon a removable reaction member (36) and which 

houses the piston of the piston-cylinder assembly (10), and 
an other end extent (8) which is externally splined and which 

houses the shuttle member (14) and the drive pin (18), the 
housing (22) being internally splined to be removably mounted
