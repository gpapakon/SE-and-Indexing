<ABSTRACT>
Heater plug having a hollow body 1 in which a ceramic heating element 2 is arranged such that it projects axially at one side of the hollow body 1. The heating element 2 consists of a ceramic conductor 6 which is embedded in a ceramic insulator 7 and is connected to power supply terminals, that is to say to frame (ground, earth) via the metallic hollow body 1 and to a plug and socket connection 3. The contacts of the ceramic conductor 6 with the power supply terminals are formed by contact surfaces 8, 9 on the ceramic conductor 6 via which the latter makes contact, on the one hand, with the metallic hollow body 1 and, on the other hand, with the plug and socket connection 3. The contacts are preferably under pressure, which is achieved by producing a bias between the components which are in contact. It is preferred to provide metallic contact parts, for example contact rings 10, 11 on the contact points between the contact surfaces 8, 9 and the metallic hollow body 1 as well as the plug and socket connection 3.

Glow plug having a hollow body in which is arranged
a solid ceramic heating rod which has a sintered-in ceramic

heating element and which projects axially on
one side of the hollow body and the heating element

of which is connected to power supply connections
(1, 3) and has a heating region (5), 
characterised in
that
 portions of the heating element (6) itself are in
the form of contact faces (8, 9) by way of which the

heating element (6) is in contact with the power supply
connections (1, 3), 
in that
 the contacts of the
heating element lie outside the heating region (5)

and 
in that
 the contacts of the heating element are
acted upon by pressure at its contact faces (8, 9)

with the power supply connections (1, 3).
Glow plug according to Claim 1, 
characterised by

an insulating and sealing ring (4) which is arranged
in the hollow body (1), on the other side, and over

which the edge (12) of the hollow body (1) is so
flanged that there is a prestress in the axial direction

which applies pressure to the contact faces (8, 9).
Glow plug according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 an axial biasing which places the contact faces
(8, 9) under pressure is produced by heating and

axial upsetting of the hollow body (1).
Glow plug according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised by
 metal contact parts (10, 11,
17, 18) which are provided at the contact sites between

the contact faces (8, 9) of the heating element
(6) and the power supply connections.
Glow plug according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the contact face (8) for
the plug connection (3) is formed on one conductor

end portion and the contact face (9) for the earth
connection is formed at a site in a region of the other

conductor end portion that is located in the hollow
body (1) composed of a metal material, the heating

element (6) being so arranged and the contact face
(9) for the earth connection being so formed that the

earth contact with the metal hollow body (1) is
formed at this site.
Glow plug according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 the hollow body (1) is insulated
from the heating element (6) and the contact face

for the earth connection is formed at the other end
of the heating element (6) and is connected to the

earth pole (20) of a double-pole connection plug (3,
20).
Glow plug according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the heating element (6)
is a ceramic conductor.
Glow plug according to Claim 7, 
characterised in
that
 the ceramic conductor (6) is, at least in parts,
doped to different degrees, so that regions having

a positive and negative resistance temperature coefficient
are formed.
