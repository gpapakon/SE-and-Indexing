<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to forging machines which are provided with, in particular, four rams fitted with tools, which are arranged offset at 90 DEG  to one another in an x shape in one plane and act radially on the workpiece, which is guided longitudinally along the system axis, and the piston-cylinder units of which, which are provided to drive the rams, are dimensioned for the entire ram stroke. The aim of the invention is simple, reliable fixing of the stroke end position corresponding to the respective tool setting or tool width. This object is achieved by virtue of the fact that the stroke of each ram (2) or of the cylinder (4) connected to it can be limited in the stroke end position by adjustable stops (17, 18, 19) arranged between the machine frame (1) and a shoulder (14b) on the ram (2) or cylinder (4). Of particular advantage is the design of the distance pieces (18, 19) as plates which can be pivoted about an axis parallel to the ram axis and have eccentric projections (24, 25) which swing in and out of the area of the shoulder (14b).

A forging machine with four rams (2) which are arranged in a cruciform manner in one 
plane, are offset at 90Â° to one another, act radially upon the workpiece guided longitudinally 

in the system axis (S) and are equipped with tools (3), wherein the rams (2) 
guided in the machine frame (1) form cylinders (4) open towards the outside from the 

system axis (S) or are connected to such cylinders (4) and are adjustable in their respective 
stroke-end position by displacement means (17, 18, 19; 32), and wherein, as a 

function of the setting of the end position of the stroke of the rams (2), either the tools 
(3), transversely displaceable in their common plane by means of tool supports (26) on 

the rams (2) and covered with the part of their operating face exceeding the pass-contour 
dimension by a lateral face of an adjacent tool, can be set by displacement 

devices (28, 29) acting upon the supports (26) in such a way, or replaceable tools (3) of 
such a width are used, that the tools (3) form a closed pass contour in their respective 

stroke-end positions, 
characterized in that
 the stroke of each ram (2) or of the cylinder 
(4) connected thereto can be limited in the stroke-end position by adjustable stops 

(17, 18, 19; 32) arranged between the machine frame (1) and a projection (14b) on the 
ram (2) or cylinder (4). 
A forging machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 threaded spindles (32) 
projecting from the machine frame act as stops, the threaded spindles (32) being supported 

in the machine frame (1) by threaded nuts (33) and being provided with drives 
(34, 35) for the relative rotation of threaded spindles (32) and threaded nuts (33). 
A forging machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 spacer members (18, 
19) are provided which can be moved into and out of the projection region (14b) and 

which define the stop position. 
A forging machine according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the spacer members 
(18, 19) are constructed in the form of plates pivotable about an axis parallel to the ram 

axis and having eccentric extensions (24, 25) pivoting into and out of the projection 
region (14b). 
A forging machine according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the spacer members 
(18, 19) forming a stop are arranged so as to be alternately pivotable about two axes 

and the eccentric extensions (24, 25) thereof are dimensioned in such a way as to maintain  
 

the mutual overlap outside the projection region (14b).
