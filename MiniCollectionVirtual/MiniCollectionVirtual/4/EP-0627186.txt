<ABSTRACT>
There is described an apparatus for preparing a beverage, in 
particular coffee, of the type wherein an electric motor (120) drives a 

piston (10) in a filling chamber (88). In accordance with the invention, 
the motor power is controlled with 
a closed loop control, so that 
the rotational speed can be held constant and the attainment of 

an end position of the piston (10) can be detected from the increase 
of the motor power required, without requiring elements mounted 

on parts which are to be cleaned regularly. 
Preferably, the apparatus is adapted to slightly press the coffee 
powder (2) by means of the piston (10), and to slightly squeeze out the 

residual dregs, after the coffee-making process has ended, by 
means of the piston (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for preparing a 
beverage, comprising: at least one chamber for receiving a 
flavor-imparting substance, and a piston which is axially 
displaceable relative to this at least one chamber; and at least 
one electromotor for driving the displacement of at least one 
apparatus part relative to the chamber, and means for detecting 
the position of this one apparatus part relative to the chamber. Such an apparatus is known in practice, in embodiments 
suitable for making coffee and/or tea and/or drinking chocolate 
and/or soup or similar beverages. Via the displaecable piston, 
water is supplied to the flavor-imparting substance, for instance 
coffee powder, and in course of time, the resulting beverage, in 
this case coffee, is discharged from the chamber. For the sake of 
convenience, only a coffee maker will be referred to hereinafter, 
but it is explicitly stated that the invention is not limited 
thereto. An example of such coffee maker is disclosed in Dutch patent 
application 88.02789. In this known coffee maker, two 
electromotors are present, a first electromotor being intended 
for driving the axial displacement of the piston relative to the 
chamber, and the second electromotor being intended for driving a 
displacement at right angles to the axial displacement. Through energization of the first motor and by means of a 
transmission system, the piston is axially displaced in the 
chamber. When the piston has reached a predetermined position, 
the motor is switched off and the piston is held in that 
position, while the momentary position of the piston is detected 
by piston-coupled detectors. In particular, the displacement of 
the piston at that location is effected through rotation of a 
threaded cylinder provided around a housing part having a 
corresponding thread, which housing part is axially displaced due  
 
to this rotation of the cylinder, the piston position being 
derived from the position of the housing part as detected by a 
detector associated with this cylinder, such as a fixedly 
arranged Hall detector and magnets mounted on the cylinder. Through energization of the second motor, when the piston 
has been withdrawn from the chamber, the chamber is tangentially 
displaced along a plurality of filling stations, allowing the 
chamber to be filled with a desired coffee powder. If the second 
motor is energized when the piston is located within the chamber, 
a closing plate is removed from the chamber to allow removal of 
coffee dregs, or,

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (1) for preparing a beverage, comprising: 

at least one chamber (88) for receiving a flavor-imparting substance (2), 
and a piston (10) which is axially displaceable relative to said at 

least one chamber (88); and at least one electromotor (120) for driving the 
displacement of at least one apparatus part (10) relative to the 

chamber (88), and means for detecting the position of said one 
apparatus part (10) relative to the chamber (88); 

characterized in that:
 
said means comprise 
a sensor (30) coupled to the driven shaft (121) of the at least one 
motor (120), and a control device (31), an input of which 

receives a signal produced by said sensor (30), said control device (31) 
controlling the power input of the at least one motor (120) in 

dependence on said signal. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
control device (31) is adapted to control the power input of the motor (120) 

by means of pulse width modulation of feed pulses supplied to the 
motor. 
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the control device (31) is adapted to derive from the signal 

produced by said sensor (30) a signal indicative of the rotational 
speed of the motor (120), and to control the power input of the motor 

such that the motor speed is kept substantially constant. 
An apparatus according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the at least one apparatus part is 

the piston (10), and that the control device (31) is adapted to calculate 
the position of the piston (10) relative to the chamber (88) on the basis 

of the signal produced by said sensor (30).  
 
An apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
control device (31) is adapted to control the motor (120) in a first step 

for displacing the piston (10) toward a reference position, to reset a 
counter in a second step and, in a third step, to displace the 

piston (10) from said reference position in the direction of an 
operating position while increasing the counter position on the 

basis of the signal produced by said sensor (30). 
An apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that the control device (31) is adapted to interrupt the displacement 

of the piston (10) toward the operating position when the motor power 
required therefor exceeds a predetermined value. 
An apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
control device (31) is adapted to compare the piston position reached 

with the desired operating position, and to generate an alarm 
signal when the piston position reached differs from the desired 

operating position by more than a predetermined degree. 
An apparatus according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in

relatively briefly toward a second predetermined value when the 
piston displacement ends. 
An apparatus according to claim 6, 7 or 8, characterized in 
that the control device (31) is adapted to supply power to the motor (120)
