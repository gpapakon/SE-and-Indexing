<ABSTRACT>
A remote controller that has preset therein 
control signals of various formats/code systems in 

correspondence with different kinds of electronic equipment 
and of different manufacturers detects the control signal from 

another remote controller typically used with the electronic 
equipment, compares it with the preset data, selects a 

predetermined signal from the preset data and stores it in a 
memory for use in controlling the electronic equipment. 

Identifier codes may also be stored in the memory to save 
memory capacity. With only one input operation, all control 

signals in the same category, such as channel codes for a 
television, may be learned and stored in the memory in 

correspondence with the respective keys. Provision is made to 
determine whether the input control signal is in the form of a 

toggle code, thereby executing the learn function for control 
signals that include the toggle code.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a remote
controller for remotely operating electronic equipment and,
more specifically, to a remote controller that can learn
commands for operating such equipment.Remote controllers that use infrared and electro-magnetic
waves to transmit modulated control data to remotely
control electronic equipment such as, for example, television
sets, stereo sets, and Video Tape Recorders (VTRs) are well
known. For example, shown in Fig. 1 is an infrared remote
controller that has a light transmitter 1 consisting of an
infrared ray transmitting element and an infrared transmission
filter at its front end, and a number of operating keys or
buttons 2 on its upper surface. Each of the operating keys 2
can cause an electronic appliance or equipment to perform some
operation. For example, in a television receiver a button PW
could turn the electric supply on and off,- and keys numbered
"1" to "12" could represent television channels.Reference character 2M shown in Fig. 1 designates a
mode key for selecting a set-up operation of the control
signal which has been preset in a manner to be described
below. By switching the mode key 2M from the operational
mode, in which the control signal is output in correspondence
with the operation of one of the buttons 2, to the select setup
mode the desired control signal is selected from the 
control signals as preset data for performing the select set-up
operation corresponding to the operating key 2.A command signal is typically obtained by modulating
a fixed frequency carrier and is then transmitted as an
infrared ray. Many different command formats are available
depending on the carrier frequency, the pulse bit periods, and
frame structures. Thus, the coding systems are different
depending on the format adopted. There are many cases where
these formats vary with the maker, model, or year in which the
electronic equipment was manufactured. Because the remote
controller has to be exclusively prepared in accordance with
each various electronic appliance, the user has to set up the
remote controller so that it can be used with the particular
desired electronic appliance.In response to this situation, remote controllers
have been developed that store in advance, or are preset, and
can output groups of control signals having different signal
structures, such as formats and code systems, for various
manufacturers and different models of electronic equipment.
These controllers are referred to hereinafter as preset remote
controllers. Such a
