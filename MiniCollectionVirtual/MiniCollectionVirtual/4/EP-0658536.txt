<ABSTRACT>
Methanol can be removed substantially from mixtures of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and methanol by absorption on ion-exchanger resins. The enriched DMC is obtained as the filtrate. The absorption is carried out at -50 DEG C to +10 DEG C and 0.1 - 10 bar.

<CLAIMS>
Process for separating off methanol from a mixture 
of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and methanol, in which 

the methanol content is 0.01-40% by weight, based on 
the weight of the mixture, characterized in that 

such a mixture is treated at from -50째C to +100째C 
and 0.1-10 bar with an ion exchanger in an amount of 

1-100% of the weight of the mixture. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the mixture to be treated contains 0.01-30% by 

weight of methanol, preferably 0.01-10% by weight of 
methanol. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the ion exchanger is used in an amount of 5-50% of 

the weight of the mixture to be treated. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
it is carried out at from -20 to +100째C, preferably 

at 0-50째C. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the ion exchanger used is a cation exchanger, an 

anion exchanger or a mixture of both. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the treatment with an ion exchanger is carried out  

 
in pseudocontinuous column operation. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in that 
a cation exchanger is used. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
a cation exchanger loaded with metal ions is used.
