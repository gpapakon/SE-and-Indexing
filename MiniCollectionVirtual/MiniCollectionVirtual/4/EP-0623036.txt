<ABSTRACT>
A unique golf training apparatus is disclosed in which an arm guide (72) is secured to the off arm of a golfer. A wrist guide (74) is pivotally attached to the arm guide and positioned on the hand of a golfer. The pivotal attachment of the wrist guide to the arm guide ensures that the golfer's hand pivots properly relative to the forearm. The golf training apparatus ensures the golfer's arm and hand are properly positioned during the swing, eliminating ''open'' or ''closed'' swings. In one embodiment, the pivotal attachment of the arm guide to the wrist guide is through a wide integral pivot (76) which rotates as a unit with the wrist guide. This integral pivot extends for the majority of the lateral dimension of the arm guide. This ensures that the wrist guide does not flex relative to the arm guide while pivoting, and results in the golfer hitting the ball more properly.

 HINGED GOLF TRAINING AIDBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application relates to a golf training aid or apparatus t ensure that a golfer's arm and wrist work with a proper hinging action whe swinging a golf club.During a golf swing it is known that the position of the off ar is critically important in properly addressing and hitting the ball- By the "off arm", applicant means the left arm for a right-handed golfer, or the right arm for a left-handed golfer. The off arm must remain relatively straight throughout the swing, and not bend at the elbow. Meanwhile, the hand must pivot relative to the arm during the back swing and follow through. It is important that the hand and arm pivot relative to each other in a plane which is generally perpendicular to the ground. If the hand is bent relative to the arm such that the club is angled towards the rear of the golfer, or towards the front of the golfer, the club head may be misaligned when the golfer follows through and strikes the golf ball. This results in a situation known as the club head being "open" or "closed", and is undesirable, resulting in hooks or slices.Many golfers experience trouble in properly maintaining the wrists and arms in proper positions during the swing, and thus do not properly hit the ball. It is an object of the present invention to disclose a training aid for ensuring the golfer's hand and arm pivot properly during a swing.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONA disclosed training aid includes an arm guide secured to the off arm of a golfer and a wrist guide positioned adjacent the hand of the golfer. The wrist and arm guides are pivotally attached to each other at a pivot point which is roughly aligned with the golfer's wrist. 

 The golfer begins the back swing and eventually reaches the highest point of the back swing. The wrist guide allows the golfer's hand to pivot relative to the arm guide in the proper plane, as described above. The wrist will not pivot in any other plane since the guides will prevent any such movement. The golfer continues with the swing by following through and striking the ball. During this follow through, the hand again pivots relative to the arm back to a generally aligned position. The wrist guide again pivots on the arm guide in the proper plane. This ensures that when the club strikes the ball it is moving in the proper direction. The club head will not be "open" or "closed".In further features of the present invention, the arm guide is attached through hook and loop type strips to a user. The wrist guide is

CLAIHS
1. A golf training apparatus comprising: an arm guide to be secured to an arm of a golfer; and a wrist guide to be aligned with the hand of a golfer, said wrist guide having an integral pivot pivotally attached to said arm guide at a pivot axis such that said wrist guide and integral pivot may rotate as a unit relative to said arm guide.
2. The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said pivot axis is adapted to be aligned with the golfer's wrist.
'
3. The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein a strap secures said arm guide to the golfer's arm.
4. The apparatus as recited in claim 3, wherein there are a pair of said straps, one being positioned near an end of said arm guide remote from said wrist guide and one being aligned immediately above said pivot axis.
5. The apparatus as recited in claim 4, wherein said wrist guide remains unsecured to the golfer's hand.
6. The apparatus as recited in claim 5, including a golf glove adapted be worn with said wrist guide.
7. The apparatus as recited in claim 1, including a golf glove adapted to be worn with said wrist guide.
8. The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein both said wrist guide and said arm guide comprise a relatively hard outer plastic shell with a relatively resilient inner layer. 


 9. The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein a lateral axis of said arm guide may be defined extending perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of said arm guide, and said integral pivot extending for a first distance in said lateral dimension, said first distance being greater than one half of the lateral dimension of said arm guide at said pivot axis such that the pivotal attachment of said wrist guide to said arm guide is sufficiently rigid to ensure said wrist guide does not flex relative to said arm guide when pivoting.
10. The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said wrist guide is disposed between said arm guide and a golfer's wrist, said integral pivot extending outwardly of said wrist guide and through an aperture in said arm guide.
11. The apparatus as recited in claim 10, wherein said integral pivot has an outer greater diameter portion received outwardly of said aperture in said arm guide, a slightly smaller diameter pivot portion received within said aperture in said arm guide.
12. The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said arm guide is c-shaped in cross-section and extends along a longitudinal axis, and said arm guide extending for more than 180 degrees about said longitudinal axis.
13. A golf training apparatus comprising: an arm guide to be secured to an arm of a golfer; and a wrist guide to be aligned with the hand of a golfer, said wrist guide having a pivot pivotally attached to said arm guide at a pivot access, such that said pivot and said wrist guide rotate relative to said arm guide, a lateral axis of said arm guide defined extending perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of said arm guide; and said pivot extending for a first distance in said lateral dimension, said first distance being greater than one-half of the lateral dimension of said arm guide at said pivot axis such that the pivotal attachment of said wrist guide to said arm guide is sufficiently rigid to ensure said wrist guide does not flex relative to said arm guide when pivoting.
