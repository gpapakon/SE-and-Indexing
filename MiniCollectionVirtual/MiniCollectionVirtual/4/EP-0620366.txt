<ABSTRACT>
A composite valve body (56) of a fuel injector comprises a dead air 
space (74) for improving hot fuel handling performance. This space (74) 

is 
cooperatively defined by a circumferential groove (62) in the 

outside diameter of a metal 
valve body (58) and a nylon sleeve (60) that is pressed onto the metal 

valve body (58) 
to enclose the groove (62).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrically actuated fuel injectors 
of the type used to inject gasoline or other like fuel into an 
internal combustion engine. From US Patents Nos. 3,244,377 and 4,266,729 it is known 
to dispose a plastic coating or sleeve over the outside of a metal 
valve body of a fuel injector. The former patent discloses a 
tetrafluoroethylene coating applied by spraying. A stated purpose 
of the coating is to prevent misalignment caused by removal of 
the nozzle from the cylinder head bore. It is also said to resist 
adherence of cabonaceous exhaust products. The latter patent 
discloses a protective sleeve made of plastic or a heat-shielding 
material and press-fit onto the body. The O.D. of the body has a 
shallow circular groove that is covered by the sleeve. A further example of a fuel injector nozzle is described in UK 
patent application GB 2182978A. The body of the nozzle includes 
a cavity shaped and located to restrict the area for conductive 
heat flow from the spray directing surface to the fuel passage. 
Restriction of the heat flow maintains the spray directing surface 
at a temperature to combust particles of combustion products 
deposited thereon, and maintain the correct performance of the 
nozzle by preventing the build-up of solids on the spray directing 
surface. While the present invention relates to the disposition of a 
poorly thermally conductive sleeve on the outside of a metal 
valve body of a fuel injector in covering relation to a groove that  
 
extends circumferentially around the O.D. of the valve body, 
principles of the invention are conceptually different from the 
disclosures of the above-discussed patents. The present invention relates to improving the so-called 
"hot fuel handling" performance of a top-feed fuel injector for a 
liquid-fueled, spark-ignited internal combustion engine. A known 
top-feed fuel injector comprises a metal valve body that is shaped 
to fit a certain size receptacle when installed on an engine. It has 
been observed that this metal body has a mass which possesses a 
certain thermal capacitance. Under certain conditions, this 
thermal capacitance delivers thermal energy to liquid fuel within 
the fuel injector. By limiting thermal energy transfer to liquid 
fuel within the fuel injector, the risk that the fuel will change 
phase before it is injected from the fuel injector is also limited. 
Vaporization of liquid fuel within the fuel injector is undesirable 
because it impairs the metering accuracy of an injection pulse.

<CLAIMS>
An electrically operated fuel injector (10) comprising a top 
inlet (12), a bottom outlet (14), a fuel passage (16) extending 

axially between said inlet and said outlet, a portion of said 
passage (16) that extends from said outlet (14) toward said inlet 

(12) being an axially extending through-bore (18) of a cylindrical 
one-piece valve body (20, 56) of a metal having good thermal 

conductivity, said through-bore (18) containing a valve seat (24), 
a selectively operable electric actuator (28, 30) disposed between 

said valve body (20, 56) and the top of the fuel injector (10), 
means operatively coupling said electric actuator (28, 30) with a 

valve element (26) that is disposed in association with said valve 
seat (24) such that said valve element (26) is caused to seat on 

and unseat from said valve seat (24) in accordance with operation 
of said electric actuator (28, 30), characterized in that said valve 

body (56) comprises means defining a first radially outwardly 
open groove (62) in its radially outer cylindrical face, and there is 

also provided a tubular cylindrical, poorly thermally conductive 
sleev
e (60) fitted onto said radially outer cylindrical face of said 
valve body (56) to enclose said groove (62) and define in 

cooperation therewith an assembly comprising a totally enclosed, 
poorly thermally conductive space (74) that is disposed 

circumferentially around said valve body (56) to provide thermal 
insulation of fuel in said through-bore (18), said valve body (56) 

further comprises means defining a second radially outwardly  
 

open groove (48) in its radially outer cylindrical face spaced 
axially of said first-mentioned groove (62) in a direction toward 

said outlet (14), and in that said sleeve (60) terminates axially 
short of said second groove (48) so as to leave said second groove 

(48) open to receive a seal. 
A fuel injector as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by said 
assembly having both a certain mass in air and a certain volume 

of particular shape that would displace a given volume of water if 
totally submerged in a body of water, said certain mass in air 

being at least 25% less than the mass in air of another valve body 
(56) both of said metal and of said same certain volume of 

particular shape. 
A fuel injector as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized further in that said sleeve (60) comprises a smaller 

diameter cylindrical portion (70) and a larger diameter cylindrical 
portion (68) that are joined by a frusto-conical portion (72) 

having a radially inner surface that extends between radially 
inner surfaces of said smaller and larger diameter cylindrical 

portions (70, 68), and in that the entirety of said radially inner 
surface of said frusto-conical portion (72) between said radially 

inner surfaces of said smaller and larger diameter cylindrical 
portions (70, 68) is exposed to said space (74).  

 
A fuel injector as claimed in Claim 3 
characterized further in that a portion of said radially inner 

surface of one of said smaller and larger diameter cylindrical 
portions (70, 68) that is immediately contiguous said radially 

inner surface of said frusto-conical portion (72) is also exposed to 
said space (74). 
A fuel injector as claimed in Claim 3 or Claim 4, 
characterized further in that said larger diameter portion (68) is 

disposed nearer the top of the fuel injector (10) than is said 
smaller diameter portion (70).
