<ABSTRACT>
Of the type that implements the "forward PWM" topology and which 
comprises a DC/AC converter (M), a self-driven synchron
ous rectifier 
(T1,T2), which rectifies the alternating voltage signal coming from the 

DC/AC converter (M), and a filter (L1,C1) that filters the rectified 
signal, thereby obtaining the DC output voltage from the DC/DC 

conversion circuit. 
This DC/DC conversion circuit is characterised in that the DC/AC 
converter (M) includes means to generate an alternating signal with a 

square waveform that does not take zero instantaneous values such that 
no current flows through the body diode of either of the transistors 

(T1,T2) of the self-driven synchronous rectifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention, according to the title of this document, refers to
a highly efficient DC/DC conversion circuit with "forward PWM"
topology which comprises a DC/AC converter, a self-driven synchronous
rectifier and a filter, and which increases the power efficiency of the
whole assembly.The circuit, according to the invention, is of particular
application to direct current supply converters for low output voltages
where the efficiency is greatly affected by losses in the rectification
stage.There are several topologies used for implementation of DC/DC converters. An
example is given in PCT WO 83/02858.Other DC/DC converters comprise a DC/AC converter, a rectifier stage with two
conventional diodes and a filter. For example, US-A-4 809 148 describes such a
DC/DC converter.This DC/DC converter does not present a high overall efficiency because there are
voltage drop in the diodes of the rectifier stage, being important for low output
voltage applications below 5V.The conduction losses of the rectifier stage can be reduced and hence, overall
DC/DC converter efficiency increased by using MOSFETs like synchronous rectifiers.
A DC/DC conversion circuits is disclosed in the relevant prior art "Practical
application of MOSFET synchronous rectifiers" by James Blanc in INTELEC'91,
Nov. 5-8, 1991, Kyoto, Jp. This DC/DC conversion circuit comprises a DC/AC
converter, a self-driven synchronous rectifier with two MOSFETs and a filter. The
DC/AC converter is of the forward type with resonant reset circuit.Unfortunately, this self-driven synchronous rectifier has limitations in the way in
which the MOSFETs can be driven due to the conduction of the body diode. Consequently the technical problem to be overcome consists in
preventing the flow of current through the body diode of the MOSFET
transistors in the self-driven synchronous rectifier, thereby reducing
its losses and enhancing the overall efficiency of the whole assembly.The DC/DC conversion circuit, in accordance with the invention,
comprise a DC/AC converter that includes means for generating an
alternating signal with a square waveform that does not take zero
instantaneous values, a self-driven synchronous rectifier and a filter.In this way, the signal coming from the transformer included in
the DC/AC converter makes that the transistors of the self-driven
synchronous rectifier are not simultaneously in the cut-off state, 
which would result in current flowing through the body diode of one of
the field-effect transistors. As a consequence, the losses that would
