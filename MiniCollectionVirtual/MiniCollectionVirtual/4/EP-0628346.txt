<ABSTRACT>
A resistor such as a resistor wire is contained in a sheet, preferably a low 
density sheet mainly consisting of inorganic fibre. Adsorbent or absorbent 

(called "sorbent" collectively) is fixed to the sheet mentioned above, to obtain 
a sorbing sheet, so that desorption and reactivation can be proceeded by 

applying an electric current to the resistor to heat the sheet. Also a sorbing 
laminate with many channels is made by laminating the sorbing sheets 

mentioned above. The sorbing sheet can be heated directly by the resistor 
contained in the sheet, therefore, sorbates can be desorbed rapidly and the 

time for reactivating the sorbing sheet can be reduced, and also the 
reactivation efficiency can be markedly increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sorbing sheet incorporating means for 
reactivating the sheet and optionally for restoring, at least to some extent, the 
activity of the sheet. The sheet may be suitable for sorbing and removing 
substances, such as water vapour, organic solvent vapour and substances 
having offensive odours contained, for example, in the air. The invention also 
relates to a sorbing laminate made by laminating alternately one or more 
sorbing sheets as mentioned above and one or more corrugated sorbing sheets 
to form a honeycomb structure or made by laminating the sorbing sheets as 
mentioned above with spacers placed between the sheets. As a desiccative body, there has been used an inorganic fibre sheet laminated 
and formed into a honeycomb structure and which is impregnated with 
humidity absorbent such as lithium chloride or calcium chloride or humidity 
adsorbent such as silica gel, alumina gel or hydrophilic zeolite rigidly or firmly 
fixed. In Japanese Patent Application no. 86969/1985 (published without 
examination: no. 252497/1986), the applicant of the present application et al. 
proposed a method of obtaining an extremely desiccative honeycomb 
adsorbing body consisting mainly of metal silicate aerogel with a matrix of 
inorganic fibre by forming a low-density sheet using inorganic fibre such as 
ceramic fibre into a honeycomb structure, which is impregnated with water 
glass, then is soaked in aqueous solution of metallic salt to produce metal 
silicate hydrogel, and is washed and dried. The applicant of the present 
application also proposed in International application no. PCT/JP 91/00592  
 
a gas adsorbing element having high efficiency of adsorbing and removing 
organic solvent vapour and odour constituent, which is obtained by fixing, by 
inorganic binder, highly hydrophobic high-silica zeolite to a honeycomb body 
made of a sheet consisting mainly of ceramic fibre. Reactivation of the 
honeycomb adsorbing body has been effected by passing hot air at 100-150Â°C 
through small channels of the honeycomb body. The term "sorb" is hereinafter used to embrace both "absorb" and "adsorb". When the above-mentioned desiccative body absorbs or adsorbs humidity to 
a certain extent, its sorbing capacity gradually decreases. Moreover, when 
absorbent is used, dew condensation or some other troubles or problems 
occur. Therefore its sorbing capacity must be recovered by purging sorbed 
humidity, i.e., by desorption. For this desorption, i.e., reactivation, heating is 
used in
