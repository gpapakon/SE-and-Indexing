<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cooking apparatus.The apparatus of the present invention provides a
significant alternative to conventional apparatus. The
apparatus of the present invention may replace
convention immersion type cooking apparatus in which
food items to be cooked are placed in a bath, vat or
other container containing cooking fluid. A wide range
of foods are cooked in such immersion type cooking
apparatus and the cooking fluids often used are oil or
water. The cooking apparatus of the present invention
is arranged such that it may spray or shower food items
to be cooked with cooking fluid to thereby effect
cooking thereof. The cooking apparatus has been
designed to convey food on a conveyor belt thus
providing a continuous feed and automated system of
cooking. The conveyor belt of the said cooking
apparatus is enclosed entirely in the cooking chamber
resulting in substantial benefits including the
maintenance of heat within the cooking chamber, easy 
cleaning of the conveyor by enabling it to be simply removed and by maintaining
the conveyor within the chamber no oil is carried outside of the cooking chamber
and thereby lost and or cooled.An example of prior art is that disclosed in EP-A-0 226 350 which discloses an
oven for preparing food products such as pizza. While this specification does
disclose an oven which uses a conveyor to transport food products through the
cooking medium, nevertheless, as can be seen clearly in Figure 1, the conveyor
is not contained wholly within the housing, thus allowing heat to easily escape
and not providing the advantages of the present invention.In accordance with the present invention there is provided a
cooking apparatus comprising:-
a housing
having an inlet end and an outlet end;
a cooking chamber located within said housing and extending
longitudinally
between said
spaced inlet and outlet ends; a conveyor means to convey food to
be cooked through said cooking chamber, said conveyor means being
longitudinally disposed between said inlet and outlet ends; loading means to
load food into said cooking chamber; and spray means to spray said food with a
cooking fluid medium as said food passes through said cooking chamber to cook said
food; and the invention is characterised in that said conveyor means is
positioned wholly within said housing.The invention will be described with reference to the drawings in which:
Figure
1 is a perspective view of an embodiment of a cooking apparatus in
accordance with the present invention; Figure 2 is an end view of

<CLAIMS>
A cooking apparatus (10) comprising:

a housing (12) having an inlet end (14) and an outlet end (16);
a cooking chamber located (18) within said housing (12) and extending longitudinally between
said spaced inlet and outlet ends;
a conveyor means (24) to convey food to be cooked through said cooking
chamber (18), said conveyor means (24) being longitudinally disposed between said inlet

and outlet ends (14, 16);
loading means (80) to load food into said cooking chamber (18); and
spray means (20, 22) to spray said food with a cooking fluid medium as said food passes
through said cooking chamber (18) to cook said food;

   characterised in that said conveyor means (24) is positioned wholly within said
housing (12).
The cooking apparatus of claim 1 wherein said conveyor means (24) passes
around end rollers (54, 56) revolving around end spindles and is driven from one of the

end spindles and connected to a drive by a male and female coupling (100) such that
the conveyor means is easily disengageable from the drive mechanism.
The cooking apparatus of claim 1 wherein said conveyor means (24) is
disengageable from the cooking apparatus.
The cooking apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein said conveyor
means passes over and around successive pairs of guide rollers (58) and tensioning

rollers (60) to create a number of dips (62) in the path of the conveyor means (24).
The cooking apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the spray
means (20, 22) to spray said food with a cooking fluid medium in the cooking chamber are

positioned above and below said conveyor means (24).
The cooking apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5 and including
means (38) to collect excess cooking fluid medium for reuse in cooking of food.
The cooking apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 and wherein
the cooking fluid medium is a liquid.
