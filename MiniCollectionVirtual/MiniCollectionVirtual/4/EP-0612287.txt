<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to removable protective caps for writing
implements, and in particular, to a removable cap having a passageway to permit air
to flow into the interior of the cap and circulate to dry residual ink at the writing
point.Removable caps for writing implements are typically configured to
enclose the writing portion of the implement to protect the functional components
therein. A conventional removable cap usually includes a hollow body member
having an opening at one end to receive the implement and being closed at the other
end to enclose the writing portion of the instrument within the body member.Although known removable caps are effective in protecting the
functional components of an implement, these caps present several disadvantages.
Typically, the conventional removable cap effectively seals the writing point, such 
sealing thereby preventing the residual ink at the writing point from drying after use.
Consequently, seepage of ink from the point commonly occurs. To overcome this
difficulty, some known removable caps have been provided with apertures which
permit air to flow through the interiors of the caps when the caps are secured on the
implements. Examples of such configurations are illustrated in WO
89/11978 and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,000,604, 5,000,603, and
4,915,529.WO 89/11978 describes a cap for writing instruments
having a double end wall and a circuitous air channel which perforates the front face
of the implement. While there is a circuitous path for air flow, the double end wall
provides a complex construction requiring close tolerances during construction to
prevent obstruction of the vent openings.US 5,000,603 and US 5,000,604 each describe a safety cap having a
cylindrical outer body and a corresponding cylindrical inner cap which is attached to
the outer body for sealing the tip of a pen or marker, List ('529) describes a cap body
having an axial passageway which is disposed within the cap body and runs parallel to
a sealing channel which covers the pen or writing instrument tip. Additionally, GB
2,233,607 discloses a writing instrument cap (5) comprising an inner cap (6)
having an opening only at the front end thereof for completely enclosing the pen point
(3), and an outer cap (16) provided with air holes (7) to prevent suffocation if the cap
(5) is accidently swallowed. The cap (16) is closed with a flat base plate (9) at a rear
end thereof.Although the aforementioned devices provide a passage for air to flow
through the interior of the cap, these devices

<CLAIMS>
A removable cap (10) for receiving a writing implement, comprising:

a hollow tubular member (12) defining a longitudinal axis and having first and
second ends, said first end defining an opening (14) for receiving the implement; and
a closing wall (16) integrally formed at said second end of said tubular
member (12), said closing wall (16) comprising:


an interior land portion (22); and
a plurality of radially directed rib members (26) extending from said
land portion (22), said rib members (26) defining a plurality of openings (24) surrounding

said land portion (22);

   characterized in that
said land portion (22) is displaced with respect to said longitudinal axis
at a position beyond said second end of said tubular member (12); and
a frusto-conical surface (20) is in concentric arrangement with said
longitudinal axis defined by said tubular member (12), said frusto-conical surface (20) having

first and second ends, said first end of said frusto-conical surface (20) being connected to
said second end of said tubular member (12),


(i) said land portion (22) and said second end of said frusto-conical
surface (20) being at substantially the same position with respect

to said longitudinal axis, or
(ii) said second end of said frusto-conical surface (20) being
disposed at a position beyond said land portion (22) with respect

to said longitudinal axis, or 
(iii) said land portion (22) being disposed at a position beyond said
second end of said frusto-conical portion (20) with respect to

said longitudinal axis, and
said rib members (26) radially extend from said land portion (22) to
said frusto-conical surface (20) and together with openings (24) define a plurality of direct

axial passageways through said closing wall (16) for air to flow from the exterior side of said
closing wall (16) to the interior of said removable cap (10) in an unrestricted manner.
The removable cap (10) of Claim 1, wherein said interior land portion
(22) is generally circular.
The removable cap of Claims 1 or 2, wherein said interior land portion
(22) comprises a generally planar outer or upper surface.
The removable cap (10) of any of Claims 1-3, wherein said tubular
member (12) also includes at least two axially extending partial ribs (30) and one

circumferential rib (32) on an inner peripheral surface thereof, said axial ribs (30) and said
circumferential rib (32) adapted to cooperatively frictionally engage an outer peripheral

surface of the writing implement.
The removable cap (10) of any of Claims 1-4, wherein said openings
(24) are arcuately-shaped.
The removable cap (10) of any of Claims 1-5, additionally comprising

an annular member (18) connected to said second end of said tubular
member (12) and in concentric arrangement with respect to said longitudinal axis defined by

said tubular member (12), with said first end of said frusto-conical surface (20) connected to
said annular member (18).
The removable cap (10) of Claim 6, wherein said annular member (18)
is monolithically formed with said tubular member.
The removable cap (10) of any of Claims 1-7 comprising three of said
radially-directed rib members (26) defining three of said openings (24).
The removable cap (10) of any of Claims 1-8, wherein said rib
members (26) each have at least one upper substantially planar surface oriented at an acute

angle relative to said longitudinal axis.
