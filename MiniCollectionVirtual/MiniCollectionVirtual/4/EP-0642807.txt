<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a support (1) having a substantially rectangular profile, in which a series of magnetic strips (2), arranged parallel to the short sides of the aforementioned support, is incorporated. In the region of its periphery, this support comprises a self-oscillating element consisting of a bundle of filaments made of an electrically conductive material, the said bundle, supplied by the magnetic field of the earth, deflects the latter field with a view to eliminating geopathogenic influxes around the abovementioned support.
