<ABSTRACT>
For dissolving a thrombus with less lytic agent and within a shorter period of time the invention provides a device for dissolving thrombi in vessels by a lytic agent. This device comprises a catheter (1), in particular a catheter for percutaneous insertion, with a means for injecting the lytic agent (6, 7) through the catheter into the region of the thrombus (24). The jacket (17) in the front region of the catheter has perforations (18) through which the lytic agent can be injected at high speed against the thrombus in a wide cone and with an essentially radially extending axis of symmetry. As a result of this, lytic agent is injected essentially radially against the thrombus wall at high speed, so that the thrombus wall is broken apart mechanically.
