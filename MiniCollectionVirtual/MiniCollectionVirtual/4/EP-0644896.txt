<ABSTRACT>
Antigenic epitopes associated with the extracellular segment of the domain which anchors immunoglobulins to the B cell membrane are disclosed. For IgE, the epitopes are present on IgE-bearing B cells but not basophils or the secreted, soluble form of IgE. The epitope can be exploited for therapy and diagnosis. For example, peptides representing the epitopes associated with the anchor domain of IgE can be used to generate antibodies against these regions, for use in allergy therapy and analysis of IgE-bearing B lymphocytes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a peptide representing the ε.mb/ec
segment of a dog or peptides having the same immunological properties
as said peptide, a vaccine comprising said peptide(s), the use of said
peptide(s) for the preparation of a medicament for treating a dog
afflicted with allergy, and a nucleotide encoding said peptide.The immediate-type hypersensitivities, such as extrinsic asthma, hay fever,
and allergic responses to certain food or drugs, are mediated primarily by
immunoglobulin E (IgE). In an IgE-mediated allergic response, the allergen
binds to IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes (basophils).
This binding causes a crosslinking of the IgE molecules and hence, the underlying
receptors for the Fc portion of IgE (FcεR), and thereby triggers the release of
pharmacologic mediators, such as histamine, the slow-reacting substance of
anaphylaxis, and serotonin. The release of these mast cell and basophil products
causes the various pathological manifestations of allergy. IgE is produced by a particular class of B lymphocytes (B cells), which
also bear IgE on their surface. In individuals sensitized to specific allergens, the
allergen-specific IgE is produced by B cells continuously.IgE binds to the receptors for the Fc of IgE (FcεR) on the surface of
basophils and mast cells very strongly. The association constant, Ka, is in the
neighborhood of 1 x 1010 liter/mole and the "off" time is more than 20 hours. The
very strong and stable association of IgE with Fc∈R means that IgE is virtually
always present on these cells. An immunotherapeutic agent targeting the IgE on
B cells must not react with the IgE on basophils and mast cells. Antibodies
which react with the IgE isotype will cross-link IgE and the underlying FcεR on
basophils and mast cells and, when administered in vivo, will induce systemic
release of pharmacologic mediators, leading to anaphylaxis.The development of monoclonal antibodies that recognize an antigenic
epitope present on the IgE on B cells, but not the IgE on basophils, was described
in US-A-5 422 258, filed 7/29/88.
These antibodies
also bind to the secreted form of IgE. In addition, the method of using such
antibodies for treating allergy, either in the form of plain antibodies or toxin-conjugated
antibodies, was described. The plain antibodies can cause the
pharmacological mechanism of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),
and the toxin-conjugated antibodies can directly cause cytolysis. Both of these
mechanisms can lead to the
