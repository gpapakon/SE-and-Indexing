<ABSTRACT>
A method of arbitrary image resolution conversion takes an original print ready 
image at a first resolution and orientation and simulates printing of that image by creating a 

representation of a page at a particular resolution and orientation using a nonlinear spot 
model for the reconstruction function (100). The image is then sampled with an aperture that 

corresponds to the desired output (120,130,160). The image data, which may be definable at 
several bits per pixel, is then made print-ready (140) by reducing the number of bits defining 

each pixel to a valid output state. The reduction step is accomplished through error diffusion 
methods (150) that maintain the local area gray density level. Since the reconstruction model 

is nonlinear, the spot model more closely emulates the actual printed dot and reduces artifacts 
in the printed image, namely moire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to arbitrary resolution conversion of binary images.
More specifically, the present invention is directed to arbitrary resolution conversion of binary
images using a nonlinear spot model.Image information, be it color or black and white, is commonly generated in a
bitmap format at a particular scale, orientation Î˜ and resolution K x L x b, corresponding to a
desired printer output, where K is a number of spots per unit of length in one dimension, L is a
number of spots per unit length in the other dimension, and b is the depth of each pixel, in
number of levels. This bitmap is present for every color separation of the output device; i.e., 4
bitmaps for a 4-color output device, 3 for a 3-color, 2 for a 2-color and 1 for a black and white
output device. In a common example of a black and white output, image data comprising a
bitmap to be printed is provided to a printer suitable for printing at 12 spots per mm (300 spots
per inch (spi)) in both dimensions, at a one bit depth giving 2 levels. Many considerations drive
this single selection of resolution, including the desirability of providing only a limited number
of fonts (alphanumeric bitmaps) so as to use only a limited amount of storage space. Common
software packages available on personal computers or for operation of input scanners for
document creation also usually provide only a single resolution output. Images are commonly
arranged at a fixed orientation.Increasingly, the resolution available from printers varies over a wider range of
choices. Printer resolutions are available over a range, for example, from less than 8 spots per
mm (200 spi) to to more than 24 spots per mm (600 spi). Resolutions vary for a number of
reasons, generally related to the quality of the output image. Simply printing a 300 spi bitmap
at 400 spi or 600 spi is undesirable however, since the image will be reduced substantially in size
on the output page or display. It would be highly desirable to provide the capability of printing
any image at any resolution, while maintaining or selecting the output size and orientation.It is a common practice to implement conversion of a bitmap of first resolution K x L x
b to a bitmap of second resolution M x N x d through simple pixel level and raster level
operations, such as pixel doubling. Pixel doubling is undesirable at the binary level (where
printing is commonly done, with binary printers) because of a tendency to distort pixel
relationships. Scaling is an identical operation to resolution
