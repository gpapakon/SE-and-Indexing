<ABSTRACT>
The image signals output from a television camera (1) which represent an object are sent to a preprocessing circuit (3), binary 
coded and blocked (resolution lowering). Then, in a circuit (4), image data in the area to be correlated are extracted from the 

preprocessed data. The extracted image data are transformed into data of polar coordinates by a polar coordinate transformation 
circuit (6) which includes a look-up table. Based upon the transformed image data, a gray-level map is formed including diametric 

patterns for every given angles. This gray-level map is sequentially compared with the diametric pattern in a circuit (7), at the 
reference angle of a reference image by a fuzzy pattern matching method for every given angles in order to fetch the correlation 

reference angle which agrees with the reference angle. By a judging circuit (9), the objective image and reference image are processed 
by the fuzzy pattern matching in the angular relationship where the fiducial angle is equal to the correlation reference 

angle, thus outputting a signal representing the result of the object recognizing judgment and corresponding to the degree of 
matching.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for identifying (or recognizing) objects. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for pattern matching in which information 
representing an object image obtained by image capture 
is compared with image information representing a 
reference pattern and degree of agreement or degree of 
similarity between these items of information is 
obtained for the purpose of checking fingerprints, 
recognizing characters or patterns, etc. The invention further relates to an image 
processing method and apparatus used for the purpose of 
the above-mentioned object recognition. Pattern matching involves creating binary image 
data by applying binarization processing to image data 
representing an unknown object of interest, comparing 
the binary image data and image data representing a 
reference pattern prepared in advance, calculating 
degree of agreement between these items of data and 
judging that an unknown image is identical with the 
reference pattern in a case where the degree of 
agreement is high. This makes it possible to check  
 
fingerprints, recognizing characters and marks, etc. 
Template matching also is available as a technique for 
determining degree of agreement. In a case where the orientation of an object of 
interest is stipulated at all times, comparing the image 
of the object of interest and the reference pattern is 
comparatively easy. However, in cases where the 
orientation (angle or direction of placement) has not 
been stipulated (is unknown), it is required that a 
large number of reference patterns having a variety of 
orientations be prepared in advance. If reference 
patterns are created while shifting the angle thereof 5° 
at a time, it will be necessary to previously create, 
and store in memory, 72 reference patterns of differing 
angles for one single pattern. This not only 
necessitates a very large memory capacity but also 
results in a longer processing time attendant upon the 
increase in the number of reference patterns to be 
checked. Even if a large number of reference patterns having 
different angles are created in advance, the angular 
position of the object image will not necessarily agree 
with the angular position of any of the reference 
patterns prepared. There is the possibility that in 
case of non-agreement, a judgment to the effect that the 
object image and a reference pattern differ will be 
rendered even if they are identical. In a case where the image of the object of interest
