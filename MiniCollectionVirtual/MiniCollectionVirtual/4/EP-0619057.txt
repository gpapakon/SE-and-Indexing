<ABSTRACT>
A scanless TV transmission system is used for transmitting and storing graphic or other information requiring significantly less band width and memory than is currently required. A simultaneously available ensemble of information can be transmitted over a narrow band channel that is limited only by the rate of time change of the entire ensemble of transmitted bits, i.e. for television or motion video the limit is the persistence of vision. Reduction in band width reduces the power required for transmission. To attain these goals, a bit generator and operator, a switched invertor (using an amplifier, transmission loop and filter), a switch invertor, a lowpass filter, an amplifier, another transmission link and a filter are utilized.

<DESCRIPTION>
SCANLESS TV TRANSMISSION SYSTEMField of InventionThe present invention relates to apparatus and method for transmitting and storing graphic and other information in public and private facilities, which method requires significantly less use of bandwidth and memory of those facilities.Description of the Prior ArtIn Patent No. 5,029,210, issued in July of 1991, a cooperative communication system was described. This patent invention shows principles of operation of a communication system which have in part been used in the present invention.Using those principles and additional ones, a new communications transmission system has been developed which greatly reduces the bandwidth requirements for transmitting television or other graphic material. Additionally, the method significantly reduces bandwidth needed for digital transmission used for any kind of information. Previous methods of TV transmission requires the material to be scanned by an electronic beam at high speed to cover a large number of pixels or illuminated spots in a raster-like field-of-view which might be called the scene. At the reception end, the received illumination values_for the pixels are reproduced and located in corresponding pixel positions on the screen of a device such as a cathode ray tube.In this method the pixels are transmitted sequentially, thus a scene containing 500 x 500 or 250,000 pixel locations must be/ 

 sent to the receiving location in a time interval of approximately 1/30th of a second which time interval is governed by the refresh time necessary for the persistence of vision. Such a method results in a transmission bandwidth requirement of 7 1/2 million hertz. However interlace methods are used presently to reduce the requirement to somewhat under 4 megahertz.There is presently a demand for even higher definition than a 500 x 500 pixel raster, 1000 x 1000 or 1,000,000 pixel images are being contemplated in high definition TV (HDTV) .The present transmission system eliminates the scanning and provides for a method of parallel transmission of information from the transmitted scene to the received screen bandwidth of the present system, that only requires in the order of 60 hertz.It is therefore an objective of the invention to provide a transmission system requiring greatly reduced bandwidth yet allowing the transmission of high definition graphic material.It is a further objective of this invention to provide a digital transmission of increased information transmission capacity operable on narrow and wide band
