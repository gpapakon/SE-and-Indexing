<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of measuring the content of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAH) remaining 
in lanolin, which comprises separating and concentrating the PAH by gel permeation chromatography using a styrene-divinylbenzene 

copolymer and determining the concentrated PAH by HPLC with a fluorometric detector; a method of 
removing the remaining PAH, which comprises measuring the PAH removal activity of active carbon by the above 

measuring method to thereby select the optimum adsorption condition and calculate the amount of the active carbon 

required for lowering the PAH content, and mixing the required amount of active carbon with lanolin to thereby effect 
specific adsorption of the PAH onto the active carbon; and a method of removing the PAH remaining in wool grease 

or lanolin by the vacuum distillation of the grease or lanolin under specified conditions either directly or after being 
treated with a borate and, if necessary, obtaining various lanolin derivatives from the treated wool grease or lanolin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for 
quantitating polycyclic aromatic compounds (hereinafter 
referred to briefly as PAH) in lanolin and a method for 
eliminating PAH using activated carbon as an adsorbent. Residues of PAH, substances suspected to be 
carcinogenic, are a serious health problem not only in 
the field of food but also in the field of cosmetics. Several methods have been proposed for the 
quantitative assay of PAH. Thus, reports are available 
on techniques for assaying PAH to the ppb order in 
aqueous systems, atmospheric air, petroleum products, 
edible oils, cereals, fishes and meats but none of these 
techniques are fully satisfactory in all the parameters 
of accuracy, expediency and reproducibility. For that 
matter, there is no report on the technology of assaying 
PAH in lanolin which is different from ordinary lipids in 
chemical structure and various properties. To achieve such a determination at the ppb 
level, it is essential to subject a starting material to 
some pretreatment or other and, so far, several methods 
of pretreatment such as liquid-liquid extraction,  
 
purification on a silica gel column, and purification 
procedures utilizing differences in molecular size, among 
others, have been reported (Int. J. Environ. Anal. Chem., 
vol. 24, No. 2, 113-131, 1986). However, these procedures 
are intended for application to meats, vegetable 
oils and mineral oils. Furthermore, the proposed cleanup 
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a Sephadex 
LH20 column involves a very complex 4-step procedure 
consisting of saponification, liquid-liquid extraction, 
purification by silica gel column chromatography, and 
final purification of the concentrate by column chromatography 
using 10 g of LH20 followed by elution with 
isopropyl alcohol for recovery of a 38-190 ml fraction. 
Moreover, this procedure requires careful upstream and 
downstream parameter settings, for example varying the 
type and concentration of the solvent system for liquid-liquid 
extraction and conditions of aqueous wash 
according to each type of material, and/or using Florisil 
in lieu of silica gel for certain types of materials, and 
no expedient cleanup is possible by GPC alone. Moreover, 
the above GPC method using a Sephadex LH20 column 
accomplishes only separation of PAH and free fatty acids. 
Of course, a cleanup technology for the GPC determination 
of PAH using a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer is not 
known.  Meanwhile, lanolin is a complex mixture of 
hydrocarbons, aliphatic higher
