<ABSTRACT>
Kardan shaft bearing in which the outer ring (1) of a rolling bearing (2) and a retaining ring (3) are connected by a rubber ring (4) vulcanised in and are supported on one another in a radially elastic manner. The rubber ring (4) has a U-shaped profile which is open parallel to the axis (5) of the Kardan shaft bearing, the rubber ring (4) being fixed on the outer ring (1) and on the retaining ring (3) at least partially in the region of the axial boundary surfaces of the said rings. The inner ring (16) of the rolling bearing (2) is provided on the side facing the shaft (14) to be supported with a rubber coating (17).

A cardan shaft bearing, in which the outer ring 
(1) of an antifriction bearing (2) and a retaining ring 

(3) are connected by a rubber ring (4) and are supported 
radially elastically on each other, the retaining ring 

(3) and the outer ring (1) having mutually facing stop 
faces (10, 11), which are covered at least partially by 

a damping layer (12) of rubber, the rubber ring (4) 
having a U-shaped profile which is open parallel to the 

axis (5) of the cardan shaft bearing, the rubber ring (4) 
being fixed on the outer ring (1) and on the retaining 

ring (3) at least partially in the region of their axial 
bounding surfaces, the cardan shaft bearing being formed 

by a spring ring (6) of rubber which has, distributed in 
the circumferential direction, liquid-filled cavities (7) 

which are interconnected by openings (8), and the damping 
layer (12) and the rubber ring (4) being formed such that 

they merge with each other in one piece, characterized in 
that the rubber ring (4) is vulcanized on, in that the 

inner ring of the antifriction bearing (2) is provided 
with a rubber coating on the side facing the shaft (14) 

to be supported and in that the rubber ring (4) and the 
spring ring (6) are formed such that they merge with each 

other in one piece and enclose a stop buffer (13), the 
stop faces (10, 11), a corrugated profiling of the stop 

faces (10, 11) and a seat for the outer ring (1) of the 
antifriction bearing (2). 
A cardan shaft bearing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the rubber coating has a profiling 

on the side facing the shaft (14). 
A cardan shaft bearing according to claim 2,  
 

characterized in that the profiling is formed by grooves 
which are open radially in the direction of the shaft 

(14) and in that the grooves are fully open on both sides 
parallel to the axis (5) of the cardan shaft bearing. 
A cardan shaft bearing according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the retaining ring 

(3) is supported relatively radially elastically on the 
spring ring (6) of rubber. 
A cardan shaft bearing according to any one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the cavities (7) are 

closed in a liquid-tight manner by the retaining ring (3) 
on the radially outward-facing side. 
A cardan shaft bearing according to any one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the retaining ring 

(3) and a bearing ring (9) arranged in the outer circumference 
of the spring ring (6) are connected by a press 

fit. 
A cardan shaft bearing according to claim 6, 
characterized in that the bearing rin
g (9) is formed as 
reinforcement of the spring ring (6).
