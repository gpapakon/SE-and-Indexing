<ABSTRACT>
An oily lubricant for mixing with the refrigerant 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane 
(R134a) is an ester of viscosity 2-30 mm²/s 

at 100°C. 
Suitable classes of esters are (1) polyesters of a polyol 
and straight or branched chain carboxylic acid (CA), (2) diesters 

of neopentyl glycol and a C6-9 CA, (3) complex esters 
of partial esters of an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol with 

C3-C9 fatty acids and aliphatic or aromatic di CA, (4) C16-22 
diallyl esters of aliphatic di- CA, (5) C18-26 diethyl 

esters of aromatic di-CA, and (6) diesters of an addition 
product of an alkylene oxide to a monohydric alcohol by an 

aliphatic di-CA. 
The viscosity is adjusted by using mixture of esters 
or by adding a polymer; suitable viscosity for a refrigerator 

is 2-9 mm ²/s and for a car air conditioner it is 7-30 mm²/s. 
The ester should be purified to have a low acid number 
of 0.1-0.5 mg KOH (g), to prevent metal corrosion, whilst 

keeping high insulating property, and it is purified so as 
to be stable and to have no more than 500 ppm of moisture. 
An anti-wear agent of the sulfur type is preferably added 
in amount of 0.01-5 w/t%, and other additives can be an anti-oxidant 

and corrosion inhibitors. 
The lubricant has excellent compatibility with R134a, 
low hygroscopicity, high thermal stability and lubricating 

property.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricant for the refrigerant 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, which lubricant has excellent 
compatibility with the refrigerant, low hygroscopic property, 
high thermal stability and lubricating property. R11 (CCl₃F) is used as a refrigerant for air-conditioning 
systems in buildings, and R12 (CCl₂ F₂ ) is used for electric 
refrigerators for foodstuffs or as refrigerant for automotive 
air-conditioning systems of the rotary or reciprocating 
type. However, they cause destruction of ozone in the 
stratosphere, and alternative substances are urgently needed. In recent years, R123 (CF₃ CHCl₂) has been considered as 
an alternative for R11, but it has some problems such as high 
price or toxicity. R22 (CHClF₂ ) is being considered as an 
alternative for R12 because of its easiness to decompose; 
however, the operating pressure at normal temperature is high 
because of its low boiling point, and pressure-resistant equipment 
is needed. Also, there are the problems of leaking from 
packings and hose components as well as problems of low electrical 
insulating property. On the other hand, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R134a), 
known as an alternative for R12, does not contain chlorine 
which cause ozone destruction, and has passed acute and subacute 
toxicity tests. Thus, attention is now focused on its 
application. Our EP-A-90310832 claims a refrigerant composition of 
R134a and a specified polyoxy propylene glycol alkyl ether 
of high viscosity. At present, polyether synthetic oils of high viscosity 
are under development as lubricating oils. The operating 
temperature of a lubricating oil for a refrigerant is normally 
between -30 and 100°C; when a polyether synthetic oil is mixed 
with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane refrigerant, these substances 
separate from each other at high temperature and there also  
 
are problems in its hygroscopic property and lubricating property. The requirements for lubricating oils for refrigerant 
are: wide temperature range for compatibility with refrigerant 
(compatibility), i.e. no clouding at high temperature (high 
solvation of refrigerant to lubricating oil), high molecular 
polarity of lubricating oil, no separation of lubricating 
oil from refrigerant at low temperature (high solubility of 
lubricating oil to refrigerant, and low molecular weight of 
lubricating oil). For this reason, high compatibility with 
the refrigerant is very important, and it is necessary that 
the substance is not separated from the refrigerant at high 
or low
