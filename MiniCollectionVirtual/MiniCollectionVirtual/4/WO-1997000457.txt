<ABSTRACT>
Two conjugate views of a patient are acquired during a SPECT nuclear medicine study. A common anatomical feature is identified in the views. Based on the differences in location of the common feature in the views, the center of rotation ("COR") of the detector during the study can be calculated after the study has been concluded. This COR can then be used during image reconstruction to determine the location at which each filtered view is backprojected. The resulting SPECT data is of higher quality because COR artifacts in the reconstructed image are reduced or eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RETROSPECTIVELY DETERMINING THE CENTER OF ROTATIONOF A SCINTILLATION CAMERA DETECTORFROM SPECT DATA ACQUIRED DURINGA NUCLEAR MEDICINE STUDYBackground of the Invention The invention relates to nuclear medicine, and more particularly relates to nuclear medicine SPECT studies. In its most immediate sense, the invention relates to SPECT studies that are carried out using parallel hole collimators.In nuclear medicine studies, a radioisotope is administered to a patient and taken up in an organ of interest (e.g. the heart) . The radioisotope then undergoes radioactive decay, giving off gamma radiation in the process. In Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) studies, a collimated detector rotates at least 180° around the patient's body axis and detects the emitted gamma radiation. From this, it is possible to "reconstruct" a three-dimensional image that shows the locations within e.g. the heart where the radioisotope is taken up.All SPECT reconstruction algorithms are based on an assumption that the coordinates of the scintillation camera system (as determined by the electronics within one or more camera detectors) correspond well to the physical coordinates of the patient. If such a correspondence is imprecise, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed SPECT images will be degraded; if such a correspondence is lacking, ring-shaped distortions (ring "artifacts") will appear in the reconstructed image.Where the SPECT study is carried out using a focussing collimator (e.g. a collimator of the fan beam, cone beam or astigmatic type) other parameters must as well be made to correspond to the physical position of the patient. These parameters are, e.g., the radius of 

rotation of the detector, the x and y coordinates of the principal ray of the collimator and the focal length of the collimator. One way to keep the coordinates of the scintillation camera system in close correspondence with the physical coordinates of the patient is to empirically determine the center of rotation ("COR") of the camera and to physically arrange the patient so that the necessary correspondence is achieved. Although this produces satisfactory results, it is inconvenient because the COR of the camera does not remain in a fixed location. COR errors arise from many sources (e.g. drift in the gains and offsets of the photodetectors in the scintillation camera detector(s) , changes in camera collimation, flexure of the camera gantry) and change with time. It is therefore necessary to periodically (advantageously, monthly)

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A method of retrospectively determining the center of rotation of a scintillation camera detector from image data acquired during a SPECT study in which the detector is caused to rotate at least 180°, comprising the following steps: acquiring a pair of conjugate views; identifying and localizing, in each of the views, a common anatomical feature; and calculating, based upon a difference between the locations of said feature in the views, the center of rotation of the study.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the common anatomical feature is a patient's body contour.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of identifying and localizing comprises the steps of acquiring a scatter image of the patient and using an edge detection algorithm on said scatter image.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the acquiring step is carried out using a focussing collimator.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising the step of backprojecting the filtered image data.
