<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of phosphate-free formulations composed of     (a) biodegradable copolymers,   (b) alkali formers  and, where appropriate,   (c) dispersants and complexing agents,   (d) low-foaming surfactants and   (e) other additives  as mechanical dishwashing compositions. These formulations are distinguished by improved biodegradability.

Use of formulations for dishwasher detergents
which, based on anhydrous substance, include


a) from 1 to 60 wt.-% of readily biodegradable copolymers
which have a degradability of â‰¥60% as determined

according to the modified OECD Sturm test, and have
been obtained from


A. monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids
and/or salts thereof,
B. monoethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic
acids and/or salts thereof,
C. monounsaturated monomers, and
D. from 0 to 15 wt.-% of other monomers capable of
undergoing free-radical copolymerization,

by free-radical polymerization in an aqueous medium,
and have one or more hydroxyl groups on the C-C polymer

carbon chain as a result of subsequent hydrolysis
or saponification of the monomer units C., and
b) from 3 to 90 wt.-% of alkaligenous agents,
c) from 0 to 60 wt.-% of dispersing and complexing
agents,
d) from 0 to 10 wt.-% of low-foam surfactants, and
e) from 0 to 50 wt.-% of other additives.
The use according to claim 1, characterized in
that component a) is included in the formulations with

2-30 wt.-%.
The use according to claim 1, characterized in
that component a) is included in the formulations with

2-15 wt.-%.
The use according to one or more of claims 1 to
3, characterized in that components b) are included in

the formulations with 5-70 wt.-%. 
The use according to one or more of claims 1 to
4, characterized in that components c) are included in

the formulations with 5-50 wt.-%.
The use according to one or more of claims 1 to
5, characterized in that components d) are included in

the formulations with 0.5-5 wt.-%.
The use according to one or more of claims 1 to
6, characterized in that components e) are included in

the formulations with 0-25 wt.-%.
The use according to one or more of claims 1 to
7 for dishwasher detergents free of phosphate.
