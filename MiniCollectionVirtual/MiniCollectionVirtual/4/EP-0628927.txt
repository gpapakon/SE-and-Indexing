<ABSTRACT>
In order that the packaging can be recognised and found again and carries a sort of marking which is safe from falsification for the normal end user and cannot be simply identified or imitated with conventional methods, it is provided by the invention that the colour marks (Figure 1) consist of different colours in such a way that each colour mark has at least one different spectral range with respect to the other colour mark in the reflecting light.
