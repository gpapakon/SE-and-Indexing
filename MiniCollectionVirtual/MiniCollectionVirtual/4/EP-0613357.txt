<ABSTRACT>
A thermal bandage apparatus (10) for simultaneously dressing and thermally treating a wounded bodily area includes a fluid absorbent member (46) having a wound contacting surface (52) for absorbing bodily fluids produced by an open wound and holding means adjacent and connected to the fluid absorbent member for holding a thermal medium (36) against the fluid absorbent member such that heat is transferred between the thermal medium and the open wound by thermal conduction through the fluid absorbent member. There is also disclosed an arrangement for providing a continuous supply of heat or cold to a wound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bandages and more particularly 
to bandages which dress a wound while at the same time 
providing heat or cold to a wound area. Thermal therapies have been used for many years to treat 
ailments such as toothaches, headaches, arthritis, 
bursitis, burns and bleeding. Thermal therapies have 
included warm or cold water applied directly to a wound, 
the use of a hot water bottle and more recently to the use 
of packages of heat retaining gel such as that described 
in United States Patent No. 3,885,403 to Spencer, issued 
May 27, 1975. Various methods of securing heat retaining packages to a 
body are described in United States Patents such as Patent 
No. 4,676,247 to Van Cleve issued June 30, 1987, Patent 
No. 4,055,188 to Pelton issued October 25, 1977, Patent 
No. 4,688,572 to Hubbard et al. issued August 25, 1987 and 
Patent No. 4,908,248 to Nakashima et al. issued March 13, 
1990. While each of the devices described in the above 
patents effectively holds a heat retaining package to a 
body part, it would appear that none is capable of being 
applied directly to an open wound. Each device requires 
that an open wound first be dressed with a conventional 
dressing before the thermal wrap can be applied. This can 
be time consuming and unnecessarily complicated as two 
different types of bandages must be tended to; the first 
being the dressing and the second being the thermal 
bandage. United States patent No. 3,871,376 to Kozak discloses a 
bandage for thermally treating a wounded bodily area, the  
 
bandage comprising holding means for holding a thermal 
medium such that heat is transferred from the thermal 
medium to the wounded bodily area, the bandage is for 
simultaneously dressing and thermally treating the wounded 
bodily area and the bandage comprises : (a) a fluid 
absorbing member having a wound contacting surface for 
absorbing bodily fluids produced by an open wound; (b) in 
which the means is adjacent and connected to the fluid 
absorbent member for holding the thermal medium against 
the fluid absorbent member such that heat is transferred 
between the thermal medium and the open wound by thermal 
conduction through the fluid absorbent member. However, 
such an arrangement means that the thermal medium cannot 
be replaced without removing the wound contacting surface 
from the wound. The present invention eliminates the use of two different 
bandages as it effectively combines the dressing and the 
thermal bandage into one. In addition, the present 
invention

<CLAIMS>
A bandage (10, 200) for thermally treating a wounded 
bodily area, the bandage (10, 200) comprising holding 

means for holding a thermal medium (36) such that heat is 
transferred from the thermal medium (36) to the wounded 

bodily area, the bandage (10, 200) is for simultaneously 
dressing and thermally treating the wounded bodily area 

and the bandage (10, 200) comprises: 

a) a fluid absorbing member (46, 208, 210) having a 
wound contacting surface (52, 212) for absorbing bodily 

fluids produced by an open wound; 
b) in which the means is adjacent and connected to the 
fluid absorbent member (46, 208, 210) for holding the 

thermal medium (36) against the fluid absorbent member 
(46, 208, 210) such that heat is transferred between the 

thermal medium (36) and the open wound by thermal 
conduction through the fluid absorbent member (46, 208, 

210); characterised by 
c) a pocket (34, 214) having an opening for receiving 
the thermal medium (36). 
A bandage according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the pocket (34) has a first side formed by said fluid 

absorbent member (46) and a second side formed by a 
flexible sheet (12) secured to said fluid absorbent 

member. 
A bandage according to claims 1 or 2, in which the 
fluid absorbent member (46) includes a moisture barrier 

(54) for preventing fluids from passing from the wound 
contacting surface to the thermal medium (36).  

 
A bandage according to claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that securing means are provided 

comprising first and second flexible end portions which 
have first and second adhesive portions (42, 44) 

respectively, the first and second adhesive portions (42, 
44) facing in the same direction as the fluid absorbent 

member (46) such that the adhesive portions (42, 44) 
adhere to areas adjacent to and on opposite sides of the 

wound. 
A bandage according to any one of claims 2, 3, or 4 
further including closure means for closing the pocket 

(34) to prevent the container from falling out of the 
pocket (34). 
A bandage according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the pocket (214) is integral with the fluid absorbent 

member (208, 210) and in thermal contact with the wound 
contacting surface (212), the pocket (214) having an 

opening for receiving a container containing a thermal 
medium, the pocket (214) and fluid absorbent member (208, 

210) having sufficient thermal conductivity to enable the 
transfer of heat between the thermal fluid and an open 

wound. 
A bandage as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the container has an inlet (124) and an 

outlet (126), the inlet (124) for permitting fluid to 
enter the container and the outlet (126) for permitting 

said fluid to leave the container. 
A bandage as claimed in claim 7 wherein the apparatus 
also includes circulating means (136) for circulating said 

thermal fluid through said container.
