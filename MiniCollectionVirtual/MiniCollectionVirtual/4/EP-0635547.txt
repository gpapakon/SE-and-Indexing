<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to thermoplastic compositions having the 
characteristics of reduced gloss or low gloss, flame retardance and high 
impact. Particularly, the invention comprises a thermoplastic 
composition of polycarbonate; a copolymer gel, such as styrene-acrylonitrile 
gel (SAN GEL); an impact modifier, such as an acrylate; a 
flame retardant; an anti-drip agent; optionally, a graft copolymer, such 
as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS); and, optionally, a copolymer, 
such as styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN). Approaches to obtaining low gloss for materials which naturally exhibit 
high gloss include functionalizing the butadiene or butadiene/styrene 
backbone or substrate onto which the other monomers are grafted. 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,612,347, for example, describes an acid functionalized 
graft copolymer. Other methods copolymerize a glycidyl ester with 
acrylonitrile, a vinyl and a rubbery copolymer as described in Japanese 
Kolai No. 65-156847. U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,534 suggests the use of an 
olefin rubber in combination with ABS in a polycarbonate or 
polycarbonate/polybutylene terephalate blend. U.S. Pat. Nos 4,677,162,. 
4,624,986 and 4,526,926 all achieve low gloss by using mass or bulk 
polymerized ABS. U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,463 describes the use of vinyl 
compounds containing glycidyl esters of unsaturated acids for low gloss 
surfaces and U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,316 uses epoxy and acid (anhydride) 
functional olefins for the same purpose. U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,777 
describes a thermoplastic molding composition having an inherent 
matter on how gloss surface finish obtained by blending a 
polycarbonate and an emulsion grafted ABS polymer, and a low gloss 
enhancing amount of a polylepoxide.  The present invention relates to flame retarded, high impact 
thermoplastic compositions having a reduced gloss or low gloss surface 
finish. Thermoplastic materials are often used on electronic equipment 
housings. This application requires high impact strength and flame 
retardance. For many applications in the business equipment market, 
specially computer housings, there is a desire for reduced gloss 
materials or low gloss materials. In the prior art, it has been difficult to 
obtain a thermoplastic material which exhibits a V-0 rating measured by 
the UL94 V0, V1, V2 flame test at 1/16 inch thickness; high impact 
resistance, which may be generally defined as equal to or greater than 
6.0 ft.-lb./in. measured by notched izod using the ASTM D-256 method; 
and a reduced gloss finish, when compared to other
