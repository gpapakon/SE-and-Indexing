<ABSTRACT>
In a method and apparatus for manufacturing a slide 
fastener chain having rows of coupling elements (24) and members 

(25, 26) of a separable bottom end stop assembly, two positioning 
holes (16) are formed at predetermined positions on reinforcing 

films (11) attached to a pair of fastener tapes (1). The 
positioning holes (16) are used to position the fastener tapes 

relative to a molding unit (7) with respect to each individual 
slide fastener length. Thus, even when a positioning 

error is produced due to a change in tension on the fastener 
tapes (1) being processed, such error is limited to a small 

extent which is created only in the individual slide fastener 
length. Thus, the coupling elements (24) and the first pin 

member (25) and the second pin member (26) can be molded 
precisely. Additional to its primary positioning function, 

the positioning holes (16) further have a function to provide 
a reference when a pair of U-shaped cutout portions (33) is 

formed in the fastener tapes (1) to facilitate smooth and 
reliable attachment of a box (35) relative to the first pin 

member (25) and the second pin member (26), and also have a 
function to provide a reference when the slide fastener chain  

 
is cut off at the cutout portions (33) transversely across the 

fastener tapes (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an
apparatus for manufacturing a slide fastener chain with
separable bottom end stop members (a first pin member for
attaching a box and a second pin member), and a method of
producing a slide fastener from the slide fastener chain.
More particularly, this invention relates to a method which
is capable of continuously manufacturing a plurality of longitudinally
spaced slide fastener chains with high accuracy of
positioning to cope with the production of slide fasteners of
different lengths each having a separable bottom end stop assembly,
a method of producing slide fasteners from the slide fastener
chains, and an apparatus for carrying out the slide fastener
chain manufacturing method.A molding apparatus disclosed in British Patent No.
1,551,535 includes a mold defining a tape feed passage along
which a pair of slide fastener stringer tapes (hereinafter
referred to as "fastener tapes") is fed intermittently. In
timed relation to the intermittent feeding of the fastener
tapes, a molten thermoplastic synthetic material is injected 
into the mold to form rows of coupling elements molded on
and along inner longitudinal confronting edges of the fastener
tapes together with end stop members (top end stops). At the
same time, to cope with a growing tendency shown toward the
multi-product and small-quantity production of slide fasteners,
the length of the rows of molded coupling elements can be adjusted.The mold is composed of a movable mold member and a
fixed mold member jointly defining a pair of rows of cavities
for forming the coupling elements. Each of the mold
members is provided with a slide core in a form of a rectangular
block. Each of the slide cores is disposed on a downstream
end of the corresponding mold member and slidably movable
in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of a runner.
Confronting mold surfaces of the slide cores define
two cavities for forming top end stop members, and a depression
interconnecting the cavities and the runner. The cavities and
the depression are formed in that part of the slide cores which
is located on one side of the slide core in the direction of
sliding movement of the slide cores. The side surfaces of the
slide cores excluding the communicating portion of the depression
with the runner form a closing surface to close one opening end
of the runner. The slide cores are movable by a cylinder between
a first position in which the depression communicates with the
runner, and a second position in which
