<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a colour 
development composite to be used for processing silver 
halide type colour sensitized material and a processing 
method using such a colour development composite, more 
particularly, to a color development composite with 
augments color developer stability when used and does 
not cause negative effects to the surroundings where it 
is used, as well as to a processing method of silver 
halide type color sensitized material using such color 
development composite. Processing of color sensitized material after 
exposure basically comprises a color development 
process, a silver dye bleach process, a silver halide 
fix process, a bleach-fix process for simultaneously 
performing bleaching and fixing, a washing process 
or a rinsing process, a stabilizing process, and a 
drying process. In addition to them, there are 
processes performed to ensure that the above principal 
processes are performed in a stable condition or 
to increase physical strength and/or stability of 
exposed sensitized material after the processing. Among 
various processing processing for silver halide 
type color sensitized material examples of 
widely used methods include one for producing a 
color print from color negative film and another for  
 
directly producing a final image in the form of positive 
color film and a print. Processes of these methods are 
based on a combination of a black and white developing 
process and either one of a process for producing color 
negative film or a process for producing color print. 
As users of color print film wish to see the prints as 
soon as possible, there has arisen a need to speed up 
processing of exposed film. Recent improvement of sensitized materials has 
made quick processing of silver halide type color 
sensitized material possible. Furthermore, it is now 
easy to process a large quantity of material in a very 
short period of time by using an automatic developing 
processor. As automotive processors have become compact 
in size and low in price, a great number of them are now 
in use. Color developer used for processing silver halide 
type color sensitized material typically includes 
primary aromatic amine type developing agent, such as, 
for example, para-phenylenediamine. Sulfite and 
hydroxylamine are also used as preservative to prevent 
the color developing agent from oxidization due to 
contact with air or other deterioration. Also used are 
alkali metal and alkali hydroxides to serve as alkali 
agents for maintaining color
