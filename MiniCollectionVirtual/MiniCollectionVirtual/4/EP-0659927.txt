<ABSTRACT>
Manufacture of a stain resistant carpet by melt mixing a fiber 
forming synthetic polyamide with a compound, being capable to 

react with an amino group, to form a homogeneous polymer melt 
into fibers, tufting the fibers into a backing to form a carpet 

and treating the carpet with polymethacrylic acid, copolymers of 
polymethacrylic acid, a mixture of polymethacrylic acid and a 

sulfonated aromatic formaldehyde condensation product, and a 
reaction product of the polymerization or copolymerization of 

methacrylic acid in the presence of a sulfonated aromatic formaldehyde 
condensation product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of 
a stain resistant carpet, more specifically, it relates to the 
treatment of a nylon carpet having a low content of amino end 
groups in the nylon with a polymethacrylic acid, copolymers of 
polymethacrylic acid, a mixture of polymethacrylic acid and a 
sulfonated aromatic formaldehyde condensation product and a 
reaction product of the polymerization or copolymerization of 
methacrylic acid in the presence of a sulfonated aromatic formaldehyde 
condensation product. Stain resistant carpet fibers are manufactured by treating nylon 
fibers with stain protectors. U.S. Pat. No. 4,822,373 discloses a fibrous polyamide substrate, 
which has resistance to staining by acid colorants by treatment 
with a partially sulfonated novolak resin and polymethacrylic 
acid, copolymers of methacrylic acid, or combination of polymethacrylic 
acid and copolymers of methacrylic acid. U.S. Pat. No. 4,940,757 discloses a stain resistant composition, 
prepared by polymerizing a Î±-substituted acrylic acid in the 
presence of a sulfonated aromatic formaldehyde condensation polymer. Disadvantage of the stain resistant fibers described above is, 
that after a treatment with a high pH shampoo, the stain 
protection of the fibers, treated with stain protectors is almost 
disappeared. Object of the present invention was, to provide a process for the 
manufacture of stain resistant carpet fibers, which keep a high 
degree of stain protection even after several treatments with a 
high pH shampoo. The object of the present invention was achieved with a process 
for the manufacture of stain resistant carpet, which comprises: 
a) melt mixing a fiber forming synthetic polyamide with a 
compound, being capable to react with an amino group, to form 
a homogeneous polymer melt;  b) spinning the polymer melt into fibers; c) tufting the fibers into a backing to form a carpet; and  d) treating the carpet with a compound, selected from the group 
consisting of polymethacrylic acid, copolymers of polymethacrylic 
acid, a mixture of polymethacrylic acid and a sulfonated 
aromatic formaldehyde condensation product and a 
reaction product of the polymerization or copolymerization of 
methacrylic acid in the presence of a sulfonated aromatic 
formaldehyde condensation product. In step (a) of the process for the manufacture of stain resistant 
carpet fibers, a fiber forming synthetic polyamide is melt mixed 
with a compound, being capable to react with an amino group, to 
form a
