<ABSTRACT>
An implantable pulse generator (10) responsive to closure of a remotely 
actuable switch (21) to operate in one or more triggered magnet modes, wherein intrinsic 

cardiac activity is continuously sensed. The pulse generator includes a timing 
mechanism for defining a predetermined triggered magnet mode interval. During 

triggered magnet mode operation, the pulse generator delivers pacing pulses at the 
end of each triggered magnet mode interval, provided that no intrinsic cardiac 

activity is sensed during the interval. Each time a stimulating pulse is delivered, the 
timing mechanism is reset and restarted to initiate another triggered magnet mode 

interval. The pulse generator is responsive to the sensing of intrinsic cardiac activity 
prior to expiration of a triggered magnet mode interval to deliver a non-competitive 

triggered stimulating pulse and to reset and restart the timing mechanism. In this 
way, competitive pacing and pacing during the vulnerable phase of a cardiac cycle 

is avoided. Upon discontinuance of switch closure, the pulse generator resumes 
operation in its previously programmed mode. Operation of the pulse generator in 

the triggered magnet mode does not interfere with other functions, such as threshold 
margin testing, battery depletion measurement, pace and sense threshold 

measurement, device interrogation and programming, and the like, normally 
associated with and performed during conventional magnet mode operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of cardiac pacemakers, and more 
particularly relates to cardiac pacemakers operable in different pacing modes. Since the introduction of the first implantable pacemakers in the 
1960's, there have been considerable advancements both in the field of 
electronics and the field of medicine, such that there is presently a wide 
assortment of commercially-available implantable medical devices. The class of 
implantable medical devices now includes not only pacemakers, but also 
implantable cardioverters, defibrillators, neural stimulators, and drug 
administering devices. Today's state-of-the-art implantable medical devices are 
vastly more sophisticated and complex than early pacemakers, capable of 
performing significantly more complex tasks. The therapeutic benefits of such 
devices have been well-proven. As the functional sophistication and complexity of implantable 
medical devices has increased over the years, it has become increasingly more 
important for such devices to be equipped with a telemetry system for enabling 
them to communicate with an external unit. For example, shortly after the introduction of the earliest fixed-rate, 
non-inhibited pacemakers, it became apparent that it would be desirable for a 
physician to non-invasively exercise at least some amount of control over the 
device, e.g., to turn the device on or off or adjust the fixed pacing rate, after 
implant. In early devices, one way the physician was able to have some control 
over implantable device operation was through the provision of a remotely and 
non-invasively actuable switch, such as a magnetic reed switch, in the implantable 
device. After implant, the reed switch would be actuated by placing a magnet 
over the implant site. Reed switch closure could then be used, for example, to 
alternately activate or deactivate the device. Alternatively, the fixed pacing rate 
of the device could be adjusted up or down by incremental amounts based upon 
the duration of reed switch closure. Many different schemes utilizing a reed 
switch to adjust parameters of implanted medical devices have been developed.

switches used to switch in and out resistors to control either the charging or 
discharging of an RC circuit to control the pulse rate); U.S. Patent No. 3,518,997
