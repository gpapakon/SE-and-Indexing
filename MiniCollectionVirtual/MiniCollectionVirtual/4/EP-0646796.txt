<ABSTRACT>
A device for measuring the angular velocity of a rotating object (35) is 
described, which device comprises a first disc (23) moving with the object and having a 

rotationally symmetrical pattern of interruptions (24), and a second disc (29) having a 
similar pattern and a detector (34) which receives radiation passed by the patterns and 

converts it into an electric measuring signal. The device is very accurate, reliable and 
compact. The linear velocity of an elongated object, for example a recording tape, can 

also be measured with the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for optically measuring the angular
velocity of a rotating object, which device comprises:
a rotatable first disc adapted to be driven by the object, and a second disc, both
discs being provided with a periodical and rotationally symmetrical pattern of
elongated interruptions in a disc face, the patterns of the two discs being
opposite to each other;an illumination system for simultaneously illuminating the complete area of each
of the two patterns; anda detection system.The invention also relates to a device of this type which is made suitable
for measuring the linear velocity of an elongated object.The invention further relates to a capstanless tape scanning apparatus
provided with two reels to be used as supply reel and take-up reel, a scanning head
arranged in the path covered by the tape between the two reels and a tape speed control
loop comprising a tape speed sensor and a control circuit for controlling the speed of a
motor for a reel functioning as the take-up reel.An optical angular velocity measuring device is known from United states
Patent 4,658,132.Capstanless tape scanning apparatuses are known in various embodiments
and described in, inter alia GB Patent Specification 1,330,923 and US Patent
3,809,335. As has been noted in the GB Patent Specification, the use of a capstan in
combination with a pressure mechanism for driving a tape at a constant linear speed has
the advantage that an accurate control of the tape speed can be realised at minimal cost
as far as the control itself is concerned. However, when a capstan is used, a number of
drawbacks occur, three of which have been mentioned in the British Patent
Specification, viz. a complicated mechanism for introducing the cassette, difficult
guidance of the edges of the tape and a greater risk of damage of the tape. Moreover,
there are problems of contamination and a slipping tape. Said drawbacks and problems 
can be prevented by driving the tape in a different manner than with the aid of a
capstan, viz. by means of the supply reel and/or the take-up reel. In this case,
provisions have to be made to keep the tape speed constant at the location of the
scanning head. A possible provision mentioned in the GB Patent Specification GB
1,330,923 is the use of a tape-driven tachometer which is not further described and,
moreover, is discarded as being less suitable. In the GB Patent Specification a choice is
made for a system in which one of the reels is driven by means of a control signal and
a non-linear signal
