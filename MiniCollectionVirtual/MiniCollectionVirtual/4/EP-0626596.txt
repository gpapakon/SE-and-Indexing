<ABSTRACT>
A coating for an optical component is formed to be antireflective 
for a 

selected wavelength and resistive to the transmission of ultraviolet 
radiation. The 

coating has first layer (24A,24B) is formed of a dielectric material 
having a refractive index n₁ 

coated onto the optical component. A second layer (26A,26B) is formed 
of a dielectric layer 

having a refractive index n₂ that is smaller than the refractive 
index n₁ of the first 

layer. The second layer (26A,26B) is formed of a material that transmits 
the selected 

wavelength while blocking ultraviolet light, thereby protecting the 
first layer (24A,24B) and the 

optical component (12) from damage due to exposure to ultraviolet 
radiation. The 

thicknesses of the layers is selected so that the coating is 
antireflective for the selected wavelength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical coatings for controlling the
reflection and transmission of particular optical wavelengths at an optical surface.
This invention relates particularly to an optical element having an
ultraviolet resistive, antireflective coating for a component of an optical system. Still
more particularly, this invention relates to an ultraviolet resistive, antireflective
coating for an intra-cavity element of a multioscillator ring laser gyroscope.A ring laser gyroscope employs the Sagnac effect to measure rotation.
Counterpropagating light beams in a closed path have transit times that differ in
direct proportion to the rotation rate about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the
path. In a ring laser gyroscope the closed path is defined by mirrors that direct the
light beams around the path. The path is generally either square or triangular in
shape, although any closed polygonal path could, in principle, be used. The closed
path is typically in a cavity formed in a frame or body that is formed of a glass
ceramic material.The cavity is evacuated and then filled with a mixture of helium and neon,
which is the gain medium for the laser. An electrical discharge excites the gain
medium, which produces light amplification and a coherent light source. The
mirrors must be precisely aligned to direct the light beams around the closed path in
a manner that promotes proper operation of the laser. The mirror surface must be
free of impurities to provide a laser beam intensity that will result in a usable signal.Once laser oscillation occurs in the system at resonant frequencies, the
difference in the length of the pathways traversed by the counterpropagating laser
beams result in a difference or beat frequency which is sensed by a photodetector
and amplified by an amplifier. The beat frequency is a result of optically
heterodyning the counter propagating beams.It is well-known that a ring laser gyroscope that employs two
counterpropagating waves is subject to the phenomenon of lock-in at low rotation
rates. At rates below a threshold value, a two-mode ring laser gyroscope will
erroneously indicate that the rotation rate is zero. When the frequency difference
between the waves is too small, the frequencies appear to be equal, which gives an
erroneous indication of a zero rotation rate. One type of ring laser gyroscope that eliminates lock-in is the Zeeman ring
laser gyroscope (ZLG). The ZLG has two pairs of (counterpropagating) circularly
polarized waves propagating in the resonant
