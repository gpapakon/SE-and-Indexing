<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to agents for improving oral hygiene and oral health, especially for inhibiting the build-up of bacterial plaque on teeth, dentures and adjoining surfaces in order to prevent and treat infections and diseases of the mouth mucus membrane, the gums and the periodontium and also to prevent caries. Said agents for promoting oral hygiene and oral health comprise ionically bonded or free thiocyanate ions and carbamide perhydrates as well as auxiliary substances and carriers known per se.

<CLAIMS>
Agents for the promotion of oral hygiene and oral health, comprising
ionically bound or free thiocyanate ions in an amount of from 0.3 to 30 g/kg

and a 1:1 urea/hydrogen peroxide adduct (carbamide perhydrate) in an
amount of from 0.3 to 30 g/kg of carbamide perhydrate in addition to per se

known additives and vehicles.
The agents according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said thiocyanate ions
are present in the form of alkali metal salts including ammonium salts and

their derivatives.
The agents according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said alkali metal salts
of thiocyanates are selected from sodium, potassium and ammonium thiocyanates.
The agents according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the weight ratio of
thiocyanate ions to carbamide perhydrate is within a range of from 10:1 to

1:10.
The agents according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the weight ratio of
thiocyanate ions to carbamide perhydrate is within a range of from 5:1 to

1:5.
The agents according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said additives and
vehicles comprise cleaning particulates, humectants, binders, thickeners,

preservatives, fluoride compounds, foaming agents, surfactants, sweeteners,
colorants and/or flavoring agents. 
The agents according to claim 1, comprising pastes, gels, mouth washes,
suspensions, sprays, granules, powders and chewing gums.
The agents according to one or more of claims 1 to 7 for the inhibition of
bacterial plaque accumulation on teeth, dental prostheses and adjacent surfaces,

for the prophylaxis, therapy and alleviation of inflammations and diseases
of the oral mucosa, gingiva, periodontium, and/or for caries prophylaxis.
The agents according to one or more of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that

said thiocyanate ions and carbamide perhydrate are present in a spatially
separated configuration.
Use of an agent as defined in one or more of claims 1 to 9 for the preparation
of a therapeutic agent for the inhibition of bacterial plaque accumulation

on teeth, dental prostheses and adjacent surfaces, for the prophylaxis, therapy
and alleviation of inflammations and diseases of the oral mucosa, gingiva,

periodontium, and/or for caries prophylaxis.
