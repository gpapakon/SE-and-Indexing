<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermostable DNA polymerases suitable for DNA 
sequencing. The following is a brief description of art relevant to DNA sequencing 
techniques. This is provided only to give general guidance to those reading the 
application, and is not an admission that any art cited herein or referred to 
explicitly or implicitly is prior art to the appended claims. DNA sequencing generally involves the generation of four populations of 
single-stranded DNA fragments having one defined terminus and one variable 
terminus. The variable terminus generally terminates at specific nucleotide bases 
(either guanine (G), adenine (A), thymine (T), or cytosine (C)). The four different 
sets of fragments are each separated on the basis of their length, one procedure 
being on a high resolution polyacrylamide gel; each band on the gel corresponds 
colinearly to a specific nucleotide in the DNA sequence, thus identifying the 
positions in the sequence of the given nucleotide base. See Tabor and Richardson, 
US Patents 4,942,130 and 4,962,020. There are two general methods of DNA sequencing. One method (Maxam 
and Gilbert sequencing) involves the chemical degradation of isolated DNA 
fragments, each labeled with a single radiolabel at its defined terminus, each 
reaction yielding a limited cleavage specifically at one or more of the four bases 
(G, A, T or C). The other method (dideoxy or chain-termination sequencing)  
 
involves the enzymatic synthesis of a DNA strand. Sanger et al. (Proc. Nat.Acad. 
Sci. USA 74:5463, 1977). Four separate syntheses are generally run, each reaction 
being caused to terminate at a specific base (G, A, T or C) via incorporation of 
an appropriate chain terminating nucleotide, such as a dideoxynucleotide. The 
latter method is preferred since the DNA fragments can be uniformly labelled 
(instead of end labelled) by the inclusion of a radioactively labeled nucleoside 
triphosphate and thus the larger DNA fragments contain increasingly more 
radioactivity. Further, 35S-labelled nucleotides can be used in place of 32P-labelled 
nucleotides, resulting in sharper definition; the reaction products are easier to 
interpret since each lane corresponds only to either G, A, T or C. The enzymes 
used for most dideoxy sequencing include T7 DNA polymerase and DNA 
polymerases isolated from thermophilic organisms such as Taq, Vent, Tth, and 
others. Other polymerases used to a lesser extent include AMV reverse 
transcriptase and Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. In the dideoxy
