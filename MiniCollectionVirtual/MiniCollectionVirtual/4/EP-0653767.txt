<ABSTRACT>
An inductive electrical transformer for medium voltage has a soft-magnetic core (1) to which a primary winding (2) and a secondary winding (3) are assigned within a casing (4,5). In order to achieve a high level of operational reliability with a simple structure, the casing (4,5) encloses the magnetic core (1), with the windings (2,3), on all sides in a gas-tight manner, the cavity which accommodates the magnetic core with the windings being filled with SF6 insulating gas.

<CLAIMS>
Inductive electrical transformer, in particular voltage transformer for medium
voltage, comprising a soft magnetic core (1) having core parts (1.1; 1.2; 1.3) joined

together in the axial direction and a primary winding (2) and a secondary winding
(3) associated therewith and comprising a tubular body (4) which encloses the

magnetic core (1) with the windings (2, 3) and which, together with flanges (5)
fitted to the ends thereof, forms a cover made of solid electrically insulating material

which encloses the magnetic core (1) in a gastight manner all-round, cavities present
within the cover (4, 5) being filled with an insulating gas, in particular SF6,

characterised in that the magnetic core (1) consists at least in the region of the
primary winding (2) of a magnetic material which has very low electrical

conductivity and consists of two end core parts (1.3) with an E-shaped cross section
with matched intermediate core parts (1.1; 1.2) arranged between them in the axial

direction, said end core parts being directed towards one another via their open
sides and the windings (2, 3) being situated between them, that the primary winding

(2) is designed in the manner of a sandwich coil consisting of a plurality of
independent disc coils (2.1-2.5) joined together in the axial direction and connected

in series, a first axially terminal disc coil (2.1) to be connected to an electric voltage
source and the axially most remote disc coil (2.5) to be connected to earth potential

and the secondary winding (3) being axially adjacent to the latter disc coil (2.5), that
the disc coils (2.1-2.5) are provided on their axial end faces with contact elements

(8) which come into contact with one another in pairs when the disc coils are joined
together in the axial direction and produce an electrical series connection between

the adjacent disc coils and that a mechanical compression spring (9) is inserted
between one flange (5) and an adjacent end core part (1.3) of the magnetic core (1).
Transformer according to claim 1, characterised in that a plurality of intermediate
core parts (1.1; 1.2) are joined together in the axial direction in each case.
