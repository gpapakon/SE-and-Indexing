A process for the continuous production of a granular detergent and/or 
cleaning composition of high apparent density by two-stage granulation in two 

mixer/ granulators arranged in tandem, characterized in that 40 to 100% by 
weight, based on the total quantity of constituents used, of the solid and liquid 

constituents are pregranulated in a first low-speed mixer/granulator, through 
which the product flows horizontally and in which granulation is possible at 

peripheral speeds of the mixing tools of 2 m/s to 7 m/s, and the initial 

granules from the first granulation stage are optionally mixed with the 
remaining solid and/or liquid constituents and converted into granules in a 

second, high-speed mixer/granulator, through which the mixture to be 
granulated flows vertically and of which the mixing tools can be operated at 

peripheral speeds of about 8 m/s, the granules formed being plastic to the 
extent that they can be compacted in the second granulation stage and the 

percentage of granules larger than 2 mm in diameter being less than 25% by 
weight. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that granulation in 
the first mixer/granulator is carried out for 0.5 to 10 minutes and, in the 

second mixer/granulator, for 0.1 to 30 seconds, preferably for up to 10 
seconds and more preferably for 0.5 to 2 seconds at peripheral speeds of 8 

m/s to 35 m/s. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
temperature of the initial granules on entering the second granulation stage 

is between 30°C and 60°C. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that at 
least part of the constituents used for granulation in the first mixer/granulator, 

preferably 10 to 100% by weight, based on the solid constituents used in the 
first mixer/granulator, is used in the form of granules, the percentage content 

of these granules, preferably spray-dried granules, being from 10 to 40% by 
weight, based on the formulation as whole.  

 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 40 
to 100% by weight, preferably 60 to 100% by weight and, more preferably, up 

to 95% by weight of the solid and liquid constituents are pregranulated in the 
first mixer/granulator and subsequently mixed with 0 to 60% by weight and 

preferably 5 to 40% by weight of remaining solid and/or liquid constituents 
and converted into the optionally still moist granules in the second 

mixer/granulator. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
granulation liquid, which optionally contains solid constituents in dissolved 

and/or suspended form, is used in quantities of 5 to 30% by weight, based on 
the total quantity of constituents used. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that water, aqueous 
solutions, nonionic surfactants present in liquid form at the process 

temperature and/or mixtures of aqueous solutions and nonionic surfactants, 
preferably a mixture of an aqueous anionic surfactant solution and nonionic 

surfactants, the mixture having a pH value of at least 7.0, are used as the 
granulation liquid. 
A process as claimed in claim 6 or 7, characterized in that 0 to 20% by 
weight and preferably up to 10% by weight, based on the total quantity of 

constituents used, of granulation liquid, preferably a mixture of an aqueous 
anionic surfactant solution and nonionic surfactants and/or an aqueous 

polymeric polycarboxylate solution, is added in the second high-speed 
mixer/granulator. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the 
filling level of the first mixer/granulator is adjusted to 10 to 80% and the 

second mixer/granulator is operated at high peripheral speeds of around 25 
m/s to around 30 m/s. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that, 
after the two-stage granulation, the granules are dried, preferably in a 

fluidized bed at feed air temperatures below 180°C, at most 15% by weight,  
 

based on the total quantity of constituents used, of water evaporating. 
A process as claimed in any of claims to 10, characterized in that the 
granules obtained are mixed with other constituents of detergents and/or 

cleaning compositions in a processing step. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that 
granules with an apparent density in the range from 600 to 1100 g/l, 

preferably in the range from 700 to 950 g/l and more preferably in the range 
from 750 to 850 g/l are produced, granules larger than 1.6 mm in diameter 

being removed by sieving and recycled after the optional drying step, the 
percentage by weight of these granules being at most 25% by weight, 

preferably at most 20% by weight and, more preferably, from 6 to 12% by 
weight.
