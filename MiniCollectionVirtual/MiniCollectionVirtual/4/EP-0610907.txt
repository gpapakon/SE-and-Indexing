<ABSTRACT>
Method of creating an autonomous family of communication units corresponding via information transmission means such as, for example, carrier currents applied to an electrical distribution network, the said family comprising at least one master controller and at least one slave unit. According to the invention, when the said master controller is switched on, it sends an interrogation message on the network; listens out, for a defined time, for a possible response message from at least one other corresponding controller linked to the same network and able to transmit a response message; sets up, depending on the possible response from the third-party set, an exclusive code number called house address number, capable of being sent to all the communications units constituting the family, and constituting a distinctive sign uniquely identifying the said family. This method applies in the field of domestic electronics for controlling household appliances.
