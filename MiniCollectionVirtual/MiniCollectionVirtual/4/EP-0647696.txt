<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cyclohexane derivative
useful as a liquid crystal material. More particularly,
it relates to a liquid crystalline compound having an
alkenyl group at the end of its molecule and a liquid
crystal composition containing the compound.Display elements utilizing liquid crystals have been
broadly used for watches, electronic calculators, etc.
These liquid crystal display elements are those utilizing
the optical anisotropy and the dielectric anisotropy of
liquid crystal substances. Liquid crystal phases include
nematic liquid crystal phase, smectic liquid crystal phase
and cholesteric liquid crystal phase, and among the above
phases liquid crystal display elements utilizing nematic
liquid crystal phase have been most broadly and practically
used. Such display elements include those of TN (twisted
nematic) mode, DS (dynamic scattering) mode, guest-host
mode, DAP mode, etc., corresponding to the electro-optic
effect applied to liquid crystal display, and as the liquid
crystal substances utilized for the respective display
elements, those exhibiting liquid crystal phases within
a temperature range as broad as possible in the natural 
in the nature are preferred. A large number of liquid
crystal compounds have already been known, but at present,
there is no single liquid crystal substance satisfying
such conditions, but several kinds of liquid crystal
substances or non-liquid crystal compounds have been mixed
to be practically used. These substances are required
to be stable to moisture, light, heat, air, etc. In
particular, recently, there has been increasing an
importance of substances having a low optical anisotropy,
as a material for liquid crystal display element for active
matrix mode represented by thin film transistor (TFT) mode.
Further, it has been required for the liquid crystal
material that its compatibility with a number of already
existing liquid crystal materials is as large as possible
at low temperatures.DE-A-40 25 550 discloses phenyl cyclohexanes of the following
formula which are suitable for STN mode displays

wherein n is 0-7, Q1 and Q2 are H or one of Q1 and Q2 is CH3,
r is 0-5, A is trans-1,4-cyclohexylene, 1,4-phenylene,
3-fluoro-1,4-phenylene or a single bond, X is F, Cl, -CF3,
-CN, -OCF3 or OCHF2, and Y and Z independently represent H or
F, provided that Y and/or Z are F if simultaneously A is a
single bond, Q1 and Q2 represent H and X is CN.The following compounds have so far been known as
compounds similar to those of the present invention:
