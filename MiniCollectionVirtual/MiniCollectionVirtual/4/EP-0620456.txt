<ABSTRACT>
A pollution-resistant silver mirror, which has very high reflection values over a large spectral range, comprises a silver coating which is arranged on a substrate and is covered by a zinc sulphide layer. In order that the silver is not attacked by the sulphur which is released when the zinc sulphide, which is to be applied, is deposited or evaporated, at least one barrier layer or one intermediate layer is inserted between the silver layer and the zinc sulphide layer.

<CLAIMS>
High reflection silver mirror, comprising at least one
optically highly reflective silver layer arranged on a

substrate and covered by a zinc sulphide layer, where
between the silver layer and the zinc sulphide layer is

inserted at least one barrier or intermediate layer
consisting of an oxide of the elements silicon, aluminium,

magnesium, groups VIb, Vb, IVb, and scandium, yttrium,
calcium, strontium, zinc, iron, indium, tin, cerium,

holmium or an oxide of mixtures or alloys of these
elements, or an oxinitride of the elements Ti, Ta, Zr, Si,

Hf, Al or a fluoride of the elements magnesium, barium,
strontium, calcium, the rare earths or lead, where the

silver layer, the at least one barrier or intermediate
layer and the zinc sulphide layer are selected such that

at a light incidence angle of 45° and over a light spectrum
from 400 nm to 12500 nm, the silver mirror has a

reflection value of 
>
 96%.
High reflection silver mirror according to claim 1, where
the barrier or intermediate layer consists of a dielectric

material.
High reflection silver mirror according to claim 1, where
the barrier or intermediate layer consists of indium tin

oxide.
High reflection silver layer according to any of claims 1
to 3, where two barrier or intermediate layers are 

provided.
Silver mirror according to claim 4, where the one barrier
or intermediate layer is an oxide or oxinitride and the

other a fluoride.
Silver mirror according to claim 4, where the two barrier
layers are made from different materials of the same type

such as oxide, oxinitride or fluoride.
Silver mirror according to claim 4, where each of the two
barrier layers is an oxinitride of the same element, but

have different atomic ratios of nitrogen to oxygen.
Silver mirror according to any of claims 1 to 7, where
further layers are added.
Silver mirror according to any of claims 1 to 8, where at
least one further intermediate layer is provided between

the substrate and silver layer.
Silver mirror according to claim 9, where the at least one
further intermediate layer is a zinc sulphide or yttrium

oxide layer.
Silver mirror according to any of claims 9 or 10, where
further layers are inserted between the substrate and the

at least one intermediate layer.
Process for production of an environment-resistant silver 
mirror according to any of claims 1 to 11 with a very high

reflection value over a broad spectrum range, where the
substrate is coated by means of vacuum metallization or

vaporisation processes or sputter processes with the
silver layer and the barrier or intermediate layer over

the silver layer, before an outer zinc sulphide layer is
applied.
Process according to claim 12, where the silver layer
coating is applied at temperatures 
<
 100°C by means of a
thin magnesium fluoride layer.
