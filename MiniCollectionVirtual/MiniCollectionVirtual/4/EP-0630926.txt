<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic polyurethane having a hardness Shore A lower 
than 80, is prepared by reacting 


a) an aromatic diisocynate selected among 4,4'-diphenylmethane-diisocynate 
(MDI), 2,4-tolylene-diisocyanate (TDI) and 

1,5-napthylene-diisocyanate (NDI), 
b) a polyhydroxy compound selected among the adipic acid/butanediol, 
adipic acid/monoethylene glycol (MEG) and 

adipic acid/hexanediol polyesters, polycaprolactones and 
polyethers obtained by polymerization of hydroxylated 

tetrahydrofuran compounds, and 
c) a chain extender selected between monoethylene glycol and 
bismetahydroxyethoxybenzene.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an elastic and rubber-like
thermoplastic polyurethane having a hardness Shore A lower than
80 and a remarkable elastic flow, a process for the preparation
thereof and the use thereof in the manufacture of footware and
related articles.It is known that thermoplastic polyurethanes having a
hardness Shore A lower than 80 harden and solidify with
difficulty. Therefore they are not suitable for being processed
by extrusion, injection and moulding or have to remain in the
moulds too long, thus making their processing cycle expensive.EP-A-0 134 455 teaches to reduce the hardness Shore A of a
thermoplastic polyurethane having a hardness Shore A of from 95
to 80, and other specific features disclosed therein, by
adding, to granules of the said polyurethane, from 11 to 100%
(generally from 25 to 70%) by weight of a plasticizer selected
among phthalic acid di(methoxyethylester), tricresyl phosphate
and diphenyl cresyl phosphate.However, this prior art does not teach how to produce an
elastic thermoplastic polyurethane which is rubber-like both at
the sight and to the touch, wherein the hardness Shore A lower
than 80 is a feature of the polymer per se which, furthermore,
has properties such that it can be processed by extrusion,
injection and moulding in fast processing cycles.It has now surprisingly been found that a thermoplastic
polyurethane having both a hardness Shore A lower than 80 and
the above properties can be produced according to claim 8. It is another object of this invention to provide
a thermoplastic polyurethane having a hardness Shore A lower
than 80 according to claim 1.The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of
from 60 to 140°C and for a time of from 1 minute to 3 hours.Of course, the reaction time is substantially affected by
the possible addition of a catalyst, as well as the type of
catalyst used and amount thereof.As regards the type of catalyst, there are apparently no 
special requirements, and standard catalysts known in the
chemistry of polyurethanes can be used. A typical example of a
preferred catalyst is Dabco 33LV(TM) of Air Product.Additives of a known type may be added to the reaction mass
to perform known functions without thereby departing from the
teaching of this invention. Examples of possible additives are:
pigments, mould release agents, plasticizers, stabilizers and
the like.Examples of suitable plasticizers are: dioctyl phthalate and
butyl benzyl phthalate. Preferably, their amount is lower than
15% and, more preferably, lower than
