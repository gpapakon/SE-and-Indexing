<ABSTRACT>
A polymer, particularly a biomedical polymer for the 
fabrication of medical and surgical devices and for use as 

a coating, is described. The polymer is derived from the 
reaction product of one or more lactone monomers and 

castor oil preferably: (a) ε-caprolactone, trimethylene 
carbonate or an ether lactone; (b) castor oil; and (c) 

glycolide, lactide or 1,4-dioxanone. The preferred 
polymer is derived from ε-caprolactone, castor oil, and 

glycolide. 
The polymer in preferred embodiments is ideally 
suited for use as a coating for a surgical suture, 

particularly an absorbable, braided multifilament suture 
and surgical needles. For this application, glycerol is 

advantageously added to the reactive monomer mix from 
which the polymer is derived.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymers which incorporate
castor oil as a copolymerizable component. More
specifically, it relates to such polymers having
properties ideally adapted for biomedical applications,
particularly for the fabrication of surgical articles and
coatings for surgical articles.The need to develop suitable coatings for numerous
applications, particularly surgical applications,
continues unabated. A coating on the surface of a
surgical article is often essential for the proper
performance of the article. For example, surgical needles
typically require that the surface of the needle be coated
to reduce the penetration force of the needle when it is
passed through tissue. The conventional coating which has
been used to coat the surfaces of needles for many years
is silicone, which is not bioabsorbable. Another example
are surgical sutures. Surgical sutures often require
coated surfaces to improve the ease with which the surgeon
can run a knot down the suture to anchor the suture at the
site of surgical trauma.Additionally, the development of biomedical polymers
for the fabrication of surgical articles, devices and
coatings, has emerged as an area of particular emphasis in
the advancement and improvement in the medical and
surgical arts. Much work has been documented on the 
increasing use of polymers in the medical profession.
These polymers exhibit a wide range of physical and
biological properties for numerous applications.One of the driving forces behind the development of
medical-grade polymers is the need to replace metallic
components of various biomedical devices, which must often
be removed from the body following surgery, with
bioabsorbable polymers that need not be removed from the
body following surgery. However, the requirements for
suitable polymer replacements of metallic components are
quite strenuous - the polymer must come close to or match
the physical properties of the substituted metal.By far, the most widely used polymers for medical
applications are those derived from lactone monomers.
Correspondingly, a wealth of research has arisen to create
novel polymer systems derived from new lactone monomer
compositions. This has lead to the development of
lactone-based polymers with a wide range of properties for
different applications. See, for example, U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,624,256; 4,788,979; 4,994,074; 5,007,923;
5,019,094; 5,037,950; 5,047,048; 5,076,807; and 5,133,739.Another component which is used in making polymers,
although not widely used for making biomedical
