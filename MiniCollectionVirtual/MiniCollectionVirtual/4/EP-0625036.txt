Equipment providing protection against splashes of water in particular or against dirt for 
a wound in a limb or bandages protecting the said wound or the like, constructed of elastic 

watertight material of a substantially tubular shape, at least one end of which is open and has 
a generally frustoconical shape characterised in that the said frustoconical end bears 

dimensional information (7) on its outer surface providing accurate reference marks when it 
is fitted, using a radial cut in the equipment's entrance and/or exit section corresponding to 

the top (5) of the frustum of the cone (4), the cut area in the said frustum (4) forming a 
peripheral seal against the limb bearing the wound which is sufficient to provide effective

marks (7) are printed or directly moulded within the material. 
Protective equipment according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterised in that 
the end (3) opposite the entry frustoconical part (4) is closed off so as to form a seal. 
Protective equipment according to the foregoing claim, characterised in that its terminal 
end has an excrescence (8) in the general form of a foot. 
Protective equipment according to the foregoing claim in which the lower part of the 
excrescence (8) in contact with the ground incorporates a non-slip thread (9). 
Protective equipment according to any one of the foregoing claims characterised in that 
the corrugated part (6) is provided in the tubular part (2) of the said equipment (1) to permit 

elastic or non-elastic reversible elongation along the longitudinal axis of the said equipment
