<ABSTRACT>
A dialogue-oriented programming system for producing and altering control programs for a CNC machine tool, having a data entry and visualisation device for entering and/or altering and simultaneously displaying data which represent the machining process sequences of the desired function and control sequence of the CNC machine tool, individual processes of these machining process sequences being able to be represented by means of symbols and blocks correspondingly connected to each other and being identified by means of marks and being able to be altered in accordance with the desired function and control sequence of the CNC machine tool, in terms of its sequence with time; a central memory and processing unit, in which the entered data are processed into NC control data for a machine control system of the CNC machine tool and the control data are output as control program for the CNC machine tool, to its machine control system, via an input/output unit; the programming system is further developed by a program editor unit in the central memory and processing unit, in which the entered data are connected to and processed with current parameters and application units to describe the dialogue sequence and the NC control program for the CNC machine tool; a database in which the entered data from the program editor unit are stored together, the database being subdivided into a region for machine control data and a region for dialogue control data of the programming system; a data control unit which carries out the access to the machine control data and the dialogue control data of the programming system in the database and their administration and is equipped for the selection of partial data stored in the database; a synchronisation unit, connected to the data control unit, for the matching of partial systems and for the fixing with respect to time of machining process sequences of the partial systems; sequence data and partial data selected by the data control unit being created, in the control program for the CNC machine tool, in the form of a synchronisation framework which can be supplemented by processing steps or machine program sets; and a feedback unit, connected to the data control unit, accesses the control program for the CNC machine tool and uses state information from a simulation run of the control program for the insertion, deletion or shifting of the marks.

A dialog-oriented programming system for the generation 
and modification of control programs for a CNC machine tool, 

comprising 

a data input and visualization means (2, 3) for the 
input and/or change and the simultaneous display of data 

which represent the machining process sequences of a desired 
function and control sequence of the CNC machine tool, with 

individual processes of these machining process sequences 
being representable by correspondingly interconnected symbols 

and blocks and characterized by synchronization flags and 
modifiable in their time sequence in accordance with the 

desired function and control sequence of the machine tool; 
a central storage and processing unit (1) in which the 
input data are processed to NC control data for a machine 

controller of the CNC machine tool and output via an input/ 
output unit as a control program for the CNC machine tool to 

its machine controller; with the NC control data including a 
subsystem assigned to each tool and/or each auxiliary attachment 

of the machine tool; 
 
characterized by 


a program editor unit (EE) in the central storage and 
processing unit (1) in which the input data for the description 

of the dialog sequence and the NC control program for 
the CNC machine tool are connected with current parameters 

and application units and processed;  
 
a database in which the input data from the program 
editor unit (EE) are stored together, with the database being 

divided into an area for the machine control data and an area 
for the dialog control data; 
a data control unit (DSE) in the central storage and 
processing unit (1), said data control unit (DSE) effecting 

the access to the machine control data and the dialog control 
data of the programming system in the database and their administration 

and being adapted for the selection of partial 
data which are stored in the database; 
a synchronization unit (SE) in the central storage and 
processing unit (1), which is connected with the data control 

unit (DSE) for matching the subsystems and for establishing 
the machining process time sequences of the subsystems; where 
in the control program for the CNC machine tool sequence 
data and partial data selected by the data control unit (DSE) 

in the form of a synchronization framework which can be 
supplemented by machining steps or machine program records, 

respectively, are generated; and 
a feedback unit (RE) which is connected with the data 
control unit (DSE) in the central storage and processing unit 

(1), which feedback unit (RE) accesses the control program 
for the CNC machine tool and uses status information from a 

simulation run of the control program for inserting, erasing 
or shifting of the synchronization flags. 
A dialog-oriented programming system according to Claim 
1, characterized in that the synchronization flags initiate  

 
start and stop conditions for the individual subsystems and/ 

or machining sections. 
A dialog-oriented programming system according to Claim 
1 or 2, characterized in that any inserting, erasing or 

shifting of the synchronization flags in the synchronized 
program is effected on the record level of the NC control 

data. 
A dialog-oriented programming system according to Claim 
1 or 2, characterized in that any inserting, erasing or 

shifting of the synchronization flags in the synchronized 
program is effected in a simulation/visualization level of 

the machining operation. 
A dialog-oriented programming system according to one of 
the previous claims, characterized in that the data
 control 
unit (DSE) divides the NC control data into block structure 

information corresponding to the location of the synchronization 
flags. 
A dialog-oriented programming system according to one of 
the previous claims, characterized in that in the data 

control unit (DSE)

subsystem in the NC control data,

flag of a subsystem in the NC control data, and

control data 
 
are provided.

6, characterized in that the first, second and third means 

(TeS, SyS,SaS) each is adapted as a logical switch with a 
counter (TeZ, SyZ, SaZ) each being arranged downstream of it. 
A dialog-oriented programming system according to Claim 
7, characterized in that the first, second and third switch

the values of the counters (TeZ, SyZ, SaZ) into different 

frames (subsystem frame, flag frame, record frame).

frame), with the detection of a subsystem, a synchronization
