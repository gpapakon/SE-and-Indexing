<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises two electrovalves (solenoid valves) (7A, 7B) grouped together in one and the same block (7) and arranged in parallel between a supply conduit (5) and a distribution (dispensing) conduit (6). Each electrovalve is provided with a micrometer screw (9A, 9B), for adjustment, which may be actuated from outside the block. While one of the electrovalves is in action for delivering identical successive quantities of liquid, the other electrovalve is adjusted as a function of a new reference value and, when the reference changes, it suffices to switch the electrovalves. The same block (7) may contain a third electrovalve (7C) for blowing pressurised gas to expel the drops remaining in the distribution pipe.

<CLAIMS>
Device for delivering doses of a liquid at a
high rate, the device comprising a solenoid valve (7A,

7B) with an inlet and an outlet and provided with a
regulating means (9A, 9B) allowing the throughput

through the solenoid valve when it is open to be
adjusted accurately, a feedpipe (5) connecting the

inlet of the solenoid valve to a source of liquid, a
distribution pipe (6) connected to the outlet of the

solenoid valve and open to the outside at the point to
which the liquid is to be delivered, and a control

device (11) controlling the opening and closure of the
solenoid valve, characterized in that it comprises a

first solenoid valve and a second solenoid valve (7A,
7B) which are mounted in parallel between the feedpipe

(5) and the distribution pipe (6), and a switching
device (12) inserted between the control device and the

first and second solenoid valves in order to actuate
one or other of the solenoid valves selectively.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the means (9A, 9B) of regulating each solenoid

valve (7A, 7B) are controlled remotely using a preestablished
program.
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that it comprises a third solenoid

valve (7C) placed between a gas feedpipe (8) connected
to a source of pressurized gas and the distribution

pipe (6), this third solenoid valve being controlled by
the control device (11) which controls the opening and

closure of the said third solenoid valve according to a 
program such that the pressurized gas is sent into the

distribution pipe (6) after the first or second
solenoid valve has closed, in order to expel the drops

of liquid that remain in the distribution pipe.
Application of the device according to one of
the preceding claims to the supplying of doses of a

cryogenic liquid to foodstuff containers.
Application according to claim 4 of a device
according to Claim 3, characterized in that the liquid

and the gas are the two phases of one and the same
product.
