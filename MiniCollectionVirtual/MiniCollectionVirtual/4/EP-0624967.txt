<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus are set forth which 
enable users of a network which supports the AMIS Analog 

Protocol to define numbering plans which shorten and 
simplify addressing an AMIS message to specific AMIS 

Sites. These user friendly numbering plans are referred 
to generally herein as "Enhanced Addressing" schemes. 
The methods and apparatus contemplated by the 
invention also support the construction and utilization 

of the "System Number", as defined in the AMIS Analog 
Protocol, particularly in conjunction with performing 

Enhanced Addressing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to voice
messaging ("VM") system networks that support the Audio
Messaging Interface Specification (AMIS) Analog Protocol.
Such networks enable VM systems manufactured by different
vendors to communicate in an open network (sometimes
referred to herein as an "open access"), environment.
More particularly, the invention relates to methods and
apparatus which enable users (sometimes referred to
herein as "subscribers") of a network which supports the
AMIS Analog Protocol to define numbering plans which
shorten and simplify addressing an AMIS message to
specific AMIS Sites. These user friendly numbering plans
are referred to generally hereinafter as "Enhanced
Addressing" schemes. The methods and apparatus
contemplated by the invention also support the
construction and utilization of the "System Number", as
defined in the AMIS Analog Protocol, particularly in
conjunction with performing Enhanced Addressing. "Address" - A means by which the system and mailbox
of a message originator and recipient are identified using
the AMIS Analog Protocol. The form of the input from the
originator identifying the intended recipient is locally
defined with the address having two parts: a System Number
and a Mailbox ID."Administrator" - A person responsible for the
administration and management of a voice messaging system."AMIS" - Audio Message Interchange Specification-A
specification of the interaction between two systems for
the purposes of exchanging voice messages. Unless otherwise
indicated, it is used herein to reference the AMIS Analog
Protocol described in the publication entitled "Audio
Messaging Interchange Specification (AMIS) - Analog
Protocol", Version 1, Issue 2, published in February, 1992,
by the Information Industry Association, Washington, D.C."AMIS Analog Networking" - A networking scheme in
which voice messages are transmitted in analog form between
two systems and which involves the use of analog (DTMF)
signals to convey protocol information. Messages 
and data are sent over switched or dedicated telephone
lines."Dedicated Circuit" - A circuit, most often
provided by a common carrier, which is used solely by the
purchaser in the AMIS context, for the purpose of
providing a transmission path between two VM systems.
Such circuits are also called "TIE" lines."Destination System" - A system to which a
message or control information is being sent."Dial-Out Port" - An analog output channel over
which outbound AMIS Analog messages are sent. The AMIS
Analog Protocol requires
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for selecting an AMIS (Audio Massaging
Interface Specification)-analog-protocol-compatible system

number to send to a destination AMIS-site, said method being
performed at an AMIS-site originating a telephone call in a

AMIS-voice mail system network that supports both a public
telephone network system and dedicated-circuit access and

comprising the steps of:

(a) configuring a data base at the originating site
defining at least a network address of the originating site,

including:

(a1) a home country code, a home trunk code, and an
analog-protocol-compatible public telephone system telephone

number when use of the public telephone network is supported
by the originating site; and
(a2) an analog-protocol-compatible dedicated-circuit
access telephone number whenever use of dedicated-circuit

access is supported by the originating site,

CHARACTERISED BY THE STEPS:

(b) if the destination dialed is prefaced by an external
access code, then selecting a system number including

information as defined in step (a1);
(c) if the destination dialed is prefaced by a
dedicated-circuit access code, selecting a system number

including information as defined in step (a2); and
(d) if the destination dialed is includes no access
code, then using information as defined in step (a1) if information as defined in step (a1) exists, and

otherwise using information as defined in step (a2).
A method as set forth in Claim 1 wherein the system
number for a destination dialed in the public telephone

network system is in the format: 

<
home country code
>
 # 
<
home trunk code
>
 # 
<
public system
telephone number
>
, where "#" are dual-tone multifrequency #
tones used as delimiters.
A method as set forth in Claim 1 wherein the system
number for a destination dialed in a dedicated-circuit system

is in the format: 0 # # 
<
dedicated-circuit telephone number
>
,
where "#" are dual-tone multifrequency # tones used as

delimiters and the prefix "0##" identifies the number to
follow as a dedicated-circuit telephone number.
