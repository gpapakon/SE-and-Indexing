<ABSTRACT>
A sputtering target (1) divided into respective 
target elements (2,3) of two or more types arranged as a 

composite on a substrate (6), is disclosed. A thin sheet (7) 
whose constituent material comprises one or more of 

the constituent materials of the target elements, and 
whose constituent material includes at least one 

metal material, is interposed between said substrate 
and target elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sputtering target, 
and in particular relates to an improvement in a 
composite sputtering target divided into target 
elements of a plurality of types arranged on a 
substrate. Conventionally, the sputtering technique has 
been widely used as a technique for forming thin 
films on specific substrates. Apart from thin films 
consisting of a single constituent, various attempts 
have been made to form thin films of composite 
constituents, such as alloys. In such sputtering 
techniques, use is made of a composite sputtering 
target, which is divided into a plurality of 
respective constituents (see for example, earlier 
Japanese patent publication JP-A-59-179783, of the 
present applicants). Such composite sputtering 
targets are used for example when it is difficult to 
produce a target having a composition ratio that 
departs beforehand from the stoichiometric amounts  
 
and yet which has a uniform composition, as for 
example with molybdenum and silicon, or in the case 
where there is a large difference between the melting 
points or vapor pressures, making it difficult to 
produce an alloy target body of the prescribed 
composition ratio. Known forms of such composite target include 
disc-shaped targets formed by assembling a plurality 
of wedge-shaped target elements arranged alternately, 
or targets in the form of a rectangular plate, 
consisting of an alternate arrangement of strip-shaped 
target elements. Examples of commonly used sputtering targets 
that are composite targets are shown in Figures 3 to 
7. As shown in Figure 3, a composite target 11 
consists of two types of target elements 12 and 13 
assembled alternately in mosaic form to produce an 
integral disc-shaped composite target. In this case, 
target elements 12 and 13 are respectively fan-shaped 
as shown in Figure 4. The composite target 11 is 
mechanically fixed (Figure 6) onto a copper backing plate 16 
constituting the substrate by an inner retaining ring 14 and 
outer retaining ring 15 shown in Figure 5. The usual fixing 
method is clamping by means of screws. In are detail, an 
axial cross-section of Figure 6 is shown in Figure 7. Film deposition using a composite sputtering 
target as described above has the advantage that the 
composition ratio of the film which is formed can be 
altered at will altering the types of target 
elements and/or their combination. However, with continuing use of a conventional 
composite target as described above, occasionally  
 
gaps are produced between the
