<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a refuse container (1) which, viewed in cross-section, is of rectangular design at least in sections, especially a waste bin having a front side (4) extending in a linear manner and a similar rear side (3) and transverse sides which are made up of a wall section (a) extending in a linear manner and a wall section (b) making an arcuate transition into the latter and extending over an angle of 90@ between the front side (4) and rear side (3) and form the side walls (5) of the refuse container (1), the ends of the arcuate wall sections (b) converging on the front side (4) making a transition one into the other via a straight intermediate piece (front side 4). In order to achieve a design which is simple in terms of production engineering and advantageous in use, the invention proposes that, between two parallel and opposite sides of the rectangular section of the waste bin (1), a separating means, such as a partition (6), is arranged which extends transversely to the sides, and that a plurality of mountings (7) are designed in the sides, opposite to each other in each case, so that the division of the refuse container (1) can be altered by moving the removable partitions.

Refuse container (1) which viewed in cross section is 
constructed at least in sections in rectangular manner - 

especially a refuse bucket with a front side (4) running in 
a straight line and a like reverse side (3) and lateral 

sides, which are composed of a wall section (a) running in 
a straight line and a wall section (b) passing over into 

the latter in the shape of an arc and extending over an 
angle of 90Â° between the front side (4) and reverse side 

(3), and form the side walls (5) of the refuse container 
(1), wherein the ends of the arc-shaped wall sections (b) 

converging on the front side (4) merge into one another via 
a straight intermediate piece (front side 4), - and between 

two parallel opposite sides of the rectangular section of 
the refuse container (1) has a partition wall (6) extending 

transversely to the sides, wherein in each of the opposite 
sides multiple fixing supports (7) are constructed at the 

edge (8) of the refuse container (1) in such a way that by 
displacement of the removable partition wall (6) the 

division of the refuse container (1) can be modified and 
wherein further fixing supports (10) for the partition wall 

(6) are constructed in the base (9) of the refuse container 
(1), characterised in that in the base (9) the further 

fixing supports (10) are constructed as guide slots, 
wherein a lower peripheral edge (17) of the partition wall 

(6) dips through a substantial section, preferably at least 
a fifth of the peripheral edge length, into the guide slot, 

which guide slots are formed from archings (16) of the base 
(9) into the container interior. 
Refuse container according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the edge (8) has an angled portion, wherein a  

 
recess is constructed both in the vertical as well as in 

the horizontal region of the angled portion. 
Refuse container according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a peripheral 

region, in which the fixing supports (7) are constructed, 
is widened in construction and, starting from an 

essentially unaffected outer ground plan line, extends into 
the interior of the refuse container (1). 
Refuse container according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that th
e partition wall 
(6) extends essentially transversely to a connecting line 

(x-x) through linkage points (13) of a carrying handle (14) 
in the side walls (5) of the refuse container (1).
