<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for producing 
tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine. This process is 

characterized by causing an aqueous tribromophenolate 
solution of not less than 50 weight % concentration 

containing a reducing agent to react on cyanuric 
chloride in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. 

The process of this invention provides for a high 
output per unit reactor capacity. The yield and purity 

of the product are also high.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing
tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine.Tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine compounds as such
are known from French Patent 1566675. It is also known
from United States Patent No. 3843650 and Japanese
Kokai Patent Publication No. 47-25232 that these
compounds have very satisfactory properties for application
as flame retardants to synthetic resins. However,
tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine compounds as described
in French Patent 1566675 were of low purity and could
be made available only in low yield.The technology for production of tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine,
thus far known from Japanese Kokai
Patent Publication No. 47-25232 and USP No. 3843650,
comprises dissolving cyanuric chloride in a ketone or
cyclic ether solvent and adding an aqueous or ethanolic
solution of a tribromophenolate. An alternative
process, disclosed in JP Kokai No. 53-116390, comprises
an alkali treatment in the presence of a phase transfer
catalyst in a heterogeneous solvent system consisting
of water and an organic solvent. However, in the production system employing a
hydrophilic solvent, solvent recovery entails the
azeotropic inclusion of water in the recovered solvent
and this water can hardly be removed from the solvent.
If the recovered solvent is reused in the reaction, the
charge cyanuric chloride is hydrolyzed and the resulting
hydrolyzate contaminates the reaction system. This
causes a decreased purity of the product compound and,
when such product is added to synthetic resin, both the
physical properties and flame resistance of the resin
are adversely affected.In the production system employing a non-hydrophilic
solvent, as described in Japanese Kokai Patent
Publication No. 3-34972, tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine
of high purity can be obtained in high yield
but since the output per unit reactor capacity is as
low as about 25%, this method is not satisfactory from
economic points of view. Thus, a tribromophenolate can
be easily synthesized by reacting tribromophenol with
the corresponding alkali in water using the alkali in
stoichiometric excess but when an aqueous tribromophemolate
solution is prepared taking into consideration the
productivity of tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine, the
workability of preparation of the tribromophenolate
(the propensity of polymerization of tribromophenol) 
and the solubility of the tribromophenolate, its
concentration cannot be higher than 48 weight %.
However, when the concentration of the aqueous tribromophenolate
solution is low, cyanuric
