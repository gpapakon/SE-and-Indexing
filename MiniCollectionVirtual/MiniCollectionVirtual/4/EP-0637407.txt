<DESCRIPTION>
 HIGH-POWER, COMPACT, DIODE-PUMPED, TUNABLE LASERTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to solid-state lasers optically pumped by diode lasers and, in particular, to a method and an apparatus for generating laser output within a 720-920 nm range and second harmonic generation laser output within a 360-460 nm range for use in medical and electronic processing applications. Background of the Invention A variety of methods have been employed for optically pumping solid-state lasers, such as those containing neodymium-doped lithium yttrium fluoride (Nd:YLF) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (NdrYAG) lasants. A common method is to use an arc lamp or other similar light source to excite a laser rod. The light source and laser rod are positioned within and at different foci of a highly reflective housing of elliptical cross-section. This method typically requires relatively large diameter laser rods to efficiently absorb enough of the pumping light emitted by the light source to allow solid-state laser operation. Another limitation of this pumping method is the relative inefficiency caused by poor overlap of the optical emission spectrum of the pumping light source with the absorption bandwidth of the solid-state lasants. For some industrial operations such as processing electronic materials, compact diode-pumped solid-state lasers offer numerous advantages. For example, large gas lasers or arc-pumped Q-switched YAG lasers that typically require water cooling systems are largely incompatible 17 with clean room conditions often necessary for link processing of dynamic random access memory devices. 

 There are several different methods for diode- pumping solid-state lasers. In U.S. Patent No. 3,982,201, Rosenkrantz et al. describe a solid-state laser that is pumped by single diode lasers or arrays of diode lasers to which the solid-state laser rod is end-coupled. Because the output wavelength of the diode laser array is a function of its temperature, the diode lasers are operated in a pulsed mode at a low duty cycle to maintain the array at a sufficiently stable temperature so that its output wavelength remains matched to the absorption bandwidth of the solid-state laser rod. The output power characteristics of this laser system are limited by the relatively inefficient match between the output of the diode lasers and the mode volume of the solid-state laser rod.In "Efficient LiNdP4012 Lasers Pumped with a Laser Diode," Applied Optics, vol. 18, No. 23 (Dec. 1, 1979), Kubodera and Otsuka describe
