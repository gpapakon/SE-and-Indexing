<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a patient table (7) with a table support (9) and a 
table top (11) which is movable at least in its longitudinal direction relative to the table 

support, there being provided a first drive mechanism (21) to assist said movement, if 
desired; the table top can be locked relative to the table support by means of a locking 

mechanism (23). The apparatus comprises a common control member (43) for moving 
the table top (11) in the longitudinal direction and for operating the first drive 

mechanism (21) and the locking mechanism (23). The control member comprises a link 
rod (57) which is movable in its longitudinal direction and which cooperates with a 

switch (67) for operating the locking mechanism, and also comprises a control element 
(71) which is movable transversely of the longitudinal direction of the link rod and 

which cooperates with a sensor (73) which supplies an output signal for control of the 
drive mechanism. The link rod (57) and the control element (71) are movable by means 

of a common control knob (59) whereby the table top (11) can be moved also without 
assistance from the first drive mechanism (21). Consequently, control of the movements 

of the table top (11) is very simple and orderly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a medical apparatus as defined in the preamble of 
Claim 1. An apparatus of this kind is known from EP-A-0 506 172. The table top of the 
known apparatus is manually displaceable and it is provided with a motor for moving the table 
top in the longitudinal direction, the table top being displaced on rollers which can be blocked 
by way of the locking device. Separate control members are provided for control of the motor 
and the locking device. The control members are accommodated on a console which also 
comprises a large number of other control members for other functions of the apparatus. 
Because of this large number of control members, the console is rather cluttered and operation 
requires close attention. It is an object of the invention to improve an apparatus of the kind set forth so 
that control is simplified. To achieve this the apparatus in accordance with the invention is 
characterized according to the characterizing part of Claim 1. An embodiment of the apparatus in accordance with the invention which can be 
realised in a technically simple manner is characterized in that the link rod is  
 
journalled so as to be movable in its longitudinal direction in a bearing sleeve which 
supports the control element and which can be tilted about a shaft extending transversely 
of its longitudinal direction, the control knob being attached to a first end of the link 
rod which is situated near a first end of the bearing sleeve, the arrangement being such 
that by pressing the control knob the link rod can be moved in its longitudinal direction 
from a first position to a second position, the bearing sleeve itself being tiltable about 
said shaft from a neutral position into two opposite directions under the influence of a 
lateral force exerted on the control knob, the force exerted on the control knob being 
transferred to the bearing sleeve via the link rod. In order to ensure that the control 
member always reaches a predetermined position automatically when the control knob is 
released, a preferred embodiment of the apparatus in accordance with the invention is 
characterized in that there are provided first resilient means which exert a force on the 
link rod which drives the link rod to its first position, there also being provided second 
resilient means which exert a force on the bearing sleeve which drives the bearing 
sleeve to its neutral position. There are various possibilities to connect the control element to the 
bearing sleeve. A very simple solution is

<CLAIMS>
A medical apparatus, comprising a patient table (7) with a table support (9) and 
a table top (11) which is manually movable at least in its longitudinal direction relative to the 

table support, there being provided a first drive mechanism (21) for assisting if desired this 
movement, it being possible to lock said table top relative to the table support by means of a 

locking mechanism (23), which apparatus comprises a common control member (43) provided 
with a common control knob (59), for moving the table top (11) in the longitudinal direction as 

well as for controlling the locking mechanism (23) by actuating the common control knob 
(59), which control member cooperates with a switch (67) in order to control the locking 

mechanism,
characterized in that
 
the common control member (43) comprises a link rod (57) which is movable in its 

longitudinal direction which link rod cooperates with said switch (67) for controlling the 
locking mechanism, and the common control member (43) is embodied for controlling the first 

drive mechanism (21) in that it also comprises a control element (71) which is attached to the 
link rod in such a way that it is movable transversely of the longitudinal direction of the link 

rod and which control element cooperates with a sensor (73) which supplies an output signal 
for operating the drive mechanism, the link rod and the control element being movable by 

means of the common control knob (59). 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the link rod (57) is 
journalled so as to be movable in its longitudinal direction in a bearing sleeve (55), which 

supports the control element (71) and which can be tilted about a shaft (53) extending 
transversely of its longitudinal direction, the control knob (59) being attached to a first end of 

the link rod which is situated near a first end of the bearing sleeve, the arrangement being such 
that by pressing the control knob, the link rod can be moved in its longitudinal direction from 

a first position to a second position, the bearing sleeve itself being tiltable about said shaft 
from a neutral position into two opposite directions, under the influence of a lateral force 

exerted on the control knob, the force exerted on the control knob being transferred to the 
bearing sleeve 
via
 the link rod.  
 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that there are provided 
first resilient means (61) which exert a force on the link rod (57) which drives the link rod to 

its first position, there also being provided second resilient means (69) which exert a force on 
the bearing sleeve (55) which drives the bearing sleeve to its neutral position. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
near one end the link rod (57) is provided with a control element (63) for operating the switch 

(67). 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of the Claims 2 to 4, characterized in that 
the control element (71) is situated near a second end of the bearing sleeve (55), the sensor 

(73) which is rigidly mounted near said second end being operative to supply an output signal 
which is dependent on a lateral displacement of the control element. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that the control element 
(71) is formed by a pin which laterally projects from the bearing sleeve (55) and which is 

made of a magnetically conductive material, the sensor (73) being a magnetic sensor. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, characterized in 
that there is provided a second drive mechanism (31) which is operative to tilt the table top 

(11) relative to the table support (9) about a horizontal shaft which extends transversely of the 
longitudinal direction of the table top, there also being provided compensation means which 

are operative to exert a force on the table top which is directed upwards in the longitudinal 
direction of the table top and is dependent on the total mass of the table top plus a load (37) 

present thereon and on the angle (Î±) wherethrough the table top has been tilted relative to the 
horizontal position, said force being substantially equal to the force exerted downwards by 

gravity in the longitudinal direction of the table top. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in that the first drive 
mechanism (21) forms part of the compensation means.
