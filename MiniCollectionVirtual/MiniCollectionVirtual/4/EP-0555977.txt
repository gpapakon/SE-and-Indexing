<ABSTRACT>
An opening roof assembly for a vehicle has a 
respective track (22) extending along each side of an 

opening in a fixed vehicle roof (10). Each track (22) has 
a slide (52). A front pivot lift arm (54, 132) supporting 

a front pivot (80) on its front end is coupled to the slide 
(52) by height adjusting means (68, 72). A panel (12) 

closes the opening in the fixed roof (10) and can first be 
pivoted about said front pivot (80) adjacent its front edge 

from its closed position to a position in which its rear 
edge is raised above the fixed vehicle roof (10) and then 

slide rearwardly above the fixed roof (10). A lift link 
(56) has its upper end pivotally connected to the panel 

(12) at a location (90) behind said front pivot (80) and 
its lower end pivotally coupled to a slot (70) in the slide 

(52). The lower end of the lift link (56) carries a lift 
link pivot pin (86) which engages in the slot (70) in the 

slide (52), movement of the lift link pivot pin (86) in 
said slot (70) is controlled by cam surfaces (88, 138) on 

the front pivot lift arm (54, 132).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an opening roof assembly 
for a vehicle, comprising stationary guide means provided 
on a side of an opening in a fixed vehicle roof and 
extending in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, a 
slide being slidably guided in the stationary guide means 
and being adapted to be driven by drive means, a front 
pivot lift arm supporting front pivot means on its front 
end and coupled to the slide by height adjusting means, a 
panel closing the opening in the fixed roof in a closed 
position and being capable of being firstly pivoted about 
said front pivot means adjacent its front edge from its 
closed position to a position in which its rear edge is 
raised above the fixed vehicle roof and then being slidably 
movable rearwardly into positions above the fixed roof, and 
a lift link having its upper end pivotally connected to the 
panel at a location behind said front pivot means and its 
lower end pivotally coupled to a slot in the slide. EP-A-0296644 discloses an opening roof assembly of 
this type consisting of a large number of parts. It is an 
object of the present invention to provide a simpler 
mechanism. According to the invention, in an opening roof 
assembly of the type described above, the lower end of the 
lift link carries a lift link pivot pin which engages in 
said slot in the slide and movement of the lift link pivot 
pin in said slot is controlled by cam surfaces on the front 
pivot lift arm. Two embodiments of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the top of a 
motor car fitted with an opening roof of the type to which 
the invention relates;  Figure 2 is a perspective view of part of the 
mechanism for an opening roof in accordance with the 
invention suitable for mounting on one side of the roof 
opening illustrated in Figure 1;  
  Figure 3 is a side view of a slide shoe forming 
part of the mechanism shown in Figure 2;  Figure 4 is a side view of a pivot lift arm 
forming part of the mechanism shown in Figure 2; Figure 5 is a side view of a lift link forming 
part of the mechanism shown in Figure 2; Figure 6 is a side view of the mechanism shown in 
Figure 2 with the panel in the fully closed position; Figure 7 is a side view, similar to Figure 6, but 
with the mechanism in an unlocked position in which opening 
movement is about to commence; Figure 8 is a side view, similar to Figure 7, but 
with the rear edge of the panel slightly raised above the

<CLAIMS>
An opening roof assembly for a vehicle, comprising 
stationary guide means (22) provided on a side of an 

opening in a fixed vehicle roof (10) and extending in the 
longitudinal direction of the vehicle, a slide (52) being 

slidably guided in the stationary guide means (22) and 
being adapted to be driven by drive means, a front pivot 

lift arm (54, 132) supporting front pivot means (80) on its 
front end and coupled to the slide (52) by height adjusting 

means (68, 72), a panel (12) closing the opening in the 
fixed roof (10) in a closed position and being capable of 

being firstly pivoted about said front pivot means (80) 
adjacent its front edge from its closed position to a 

position in which its rear edge is raised above the fixed 
vehicle roof (10) and then being slidably movable 

rearwardly into positions above the fixed roof (10), and a 
lift link (56) having its upper end pivotally connected to 

the panel (12) at a location (90) behind said front pivot 
means (80) and its lower end pivotally coupled to a slot 

(70) in the slide (52), characterised in that the lower end 
of the lift link (56) carries a lift link pivot pin (86) 

which engages in said slot (70) in the slide (52), movement 
of the lift link pivot pin (86) in said slot (70) is 

controlled by cam surfaces (88, 138) on the front pivot 
lift arm (54, 132). 
An opening roof assembly according to claim 1, 
wherein the lift link pivot pin (86) directly engages in 

said slot (70) in the slide (52). 
An opening roof assembly according to claim 1 or 
2, wherein the slot (70) is L-shaped, having a 

substantially horizontal part and a substantially vertical 
part, and the cam surfaces include an open-ended slot (88, 

138) inclined at respective acute angles to both the 
horizontal part and the vertical part of the L-shaped slot 

(70) so that horizontal movement of the slide (52) relative 
to the front pivot lift arm (54, 132) causes movement of  

 
the lift link pivot pin (86) away from an end of the 

horizontal part of the slot (70) during an initial phase of 
movement from the closed position. 
An opening roof assembly according to claim 1, 2 
or 3, wherein the cam surfaces include an edge (126, 140) 

arranged to retain the lift link pivot pin (86) at an end 
of the vertical part of the slot (70) during a subsequent 

phase of movement. 
An opening roof assembly according to any 
preceding claim, wherein the height adjusting means 

comprises a front lift pivot pin (72) fast with the front 
pivot lift arm (54, 132) and engaging in an inclined slot 

(68) in the slide (52) so arranged that rearward movement 
of the slide (52) relative to the front pivot lift arm (54, 

132) causes upward movement of the front pivot means (80), 
a projection (72) on the front pivot lift arm (54, 132) 

engaging with a slot (44, 46) in the stationary guide means 
(22) so as to restrict horizontal movement of the front 

pivot lift arm (54, 132) when the front lift pivot pin (72) 
is displaced from the upper end of the inclined slot (68) 

and to restrict downward movement of the front pivot means 
(80) when the front pivot lift arm (54, 132) is displaced 

from its foremost position in the stationary guide means 
(22).

wherein said projection on the front pivot lift arm (54, 

132) comprises a projecting end of the front lift pivot pin 
(72).  

 
An opening roof assembly according to claim 5 or 
6, wherein a slide bar (100) is slidably located in the 

stationary guide means (22) so that an upwardly projecting 
rearwardly facing latch formation (104) thereon is movable 

into and out of engagement with a downwardly projecting 
forwardly facing latch formation (106) secured adjacent to 

the rear edge of the panel (12), and releasable coupling 
means (96, 98) are arranged to connect the slide bar (100) 

for simultaneous movement with the slide (52) as the front  
 

lift pivot pin (72) moves along a first section (110) of 
the inclined slot (68). 
An opening roof assembly according to any 
preceding claim, wherein a second front lift pivot pin (76) 

in the rear end of the slide (52) engages in a slot (74) in 
the rear end of the front pivot lift arm (54), the slot 

(74) being of the same shape and dimensions as the inclined 
slot (68) in the slide (52) and inverted with respect 

thereto.
