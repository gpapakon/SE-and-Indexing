A preferred embodiment provides transgenic tobacco plants that express a sufficient concentration of properly processed bovine lysozyme c2 to render the plants less susceptible to bacterial plant pathogens. Methods and compositions for treatment of plants, seeds and other plant tissues prior to or after exposure or infection with bacterial plant pathogens are also provided. In particular, compositions and methods of contacting plants with such compositions that contain a concentration of bovine lysozyme c2 or other ruminant or ruminant-like lysozyme are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTECTION OF PLANTS AGAINST PLANT PATHOGENSRELATED APPLICATIONS The subject matter of this application is related to U.S. Application Serial No. 07/265,634, to Digan et a_L_., filed November 1, 1988, "PRODUCTION OF ANIMAL LYSOZYME C VIA SECRETION FROM PICHIA PASTORIS AND COMPOSITION THEREFOR", which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 07/115,940, filed November 2, 1987, now abandoned. U.S Application Serial Nos. 07/265,634 and 07/115,940 are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference thereto.FIELD OF INVENTION This invention is directed to transgenic plants that include heterologous DNA that encodes a ruminant lysozyme, that is expressed in the plant and that thereby provides protection against diseases caused by plant pathogens, particularly plant bacterial pathogens. This invention is also directed to seeds that are coated with a composition that contains a ruminant lysozyme and to methods of treating plants, cut flowers, fruits, seeds and other plant tissues, which are infected with one or more plant pathogens or which are susceptible to such infection, by contacting the plants, flowers, fruits or seeds with a ruminant lysozyme in order to treat them for diseases caused by plant pathogens or to make them less susceptible or resistant to diseases caused by plant pathogens. This invention is also directed to methods for producing a ruminant lysozyme from transgenic plants that express the lysozyme and to peptides that direct proper processing of heterologous proteins in transgenic plants. 

 BAC GROUND OF THE INVENTION Plant Pathogens.Plants are exposed to numerous denizens of their environment, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and nematodes. Although many of the interactions between these organisms and plants, particularly via the roots of the plants, are beneficial, many of the interactions are harmful to the plants. The decimation of agricultural crops, ornamental plants and other plants by diseases caused by plant pathogens, particularly bacterial pathogens, is a worldwide problem that has enormous economic impact.There are many pathogenic species of bacteria, fungi and nematodes. Fungal plant pathogens include species from the genera Fusarium. Pythium. Phytophthora. Verticilliumf Rhizoctonia. Macrophomina. and others (see, e.Ïƒ.. U.S. Patent No. 4,940,840 to Suslow et al.) . Diseases caused by such fungal species include pre- and post-emergence seedling damping-off, hypocotyl rots, root rots, crown rots, and others. Nematode pathogens, which include species from the
