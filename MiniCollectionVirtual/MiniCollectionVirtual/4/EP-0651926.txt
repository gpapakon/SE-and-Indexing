<ABSTRACT>
Digital data (particularly encoded television program signals) are communicated from a transmitter to a terrestrial receiver by convolutional encoding the data into a first and a second signal during different periods representing a rate 1/2 signal. During the different periods, the two signals are combined and punctured into one serial punctured bit stream for producing a forward error correction convolutional encoded signal having a manually or automatically selected rate e.g. rate 2/3 or 6/7. Signals being encoded into different variable rates are transmitted at mutually exclusive times at first and second power levels to the receiver via a satellite. At the variable rates, parallel punctured bit streams are simultaneously derived and modulate simultaneously the pair of orthogonal carriers (QPSK). The improved puncturing method is capable of handling all of the optimum punctured codes and uses a punctured clock, multiplexer, FIFO, RAM, ROM, rate control source. The punctured clock is used to derive a pair of wavetrains comprising the I and Q channels sequential bits and dummy bits inserted into the serial signal. The receiver responds to the QPSK carrier and derives first a serial signal having one sequential bit stream of alternating both I and Q sequential bits. Further they are sequentially re-arranged as signals I and Q at the same time slots.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to feed
forward error correction transmitters, receivers, systems
and methods employing punctured convolutional encoding
and decoding and more particularly to such transmitters,
receivers, systems and methods wherein (a) a serial bit
stream at the transmitter and/or receiver is divided into
a pair of bit streams and/or (b) feed forward error
correction data signals having 2/3 and 6/7 punctured
codes are radiated at mutually exclusive times from a
geosynchronous satellite at first and second power
levels, respectively, to a terrestrial receiving site
including an antenna dish having a diameter of no more
than approximately one meter.In a convolutional encoded feed forward error
correction transmitter, a binary bit stream is divided
into first and second bit streams respectively including
sequential bits P1(0), P1(1), P1(2), P1(3), P1(4) etc.
and P2(0), P2(1), P2(2), P2(3), P2(4) etc. In one-half
rate convolutional encoding, the first and second bit
streams are formed by combining adjacent bits in the
original bit stream in accordance with a modulo 2
function, i.e., by using half adders responsive to the
adjacent bits.Because of the redundancy in the first and second
bit streams, it is possible to remove some of the bits
from these bit streams without substantial loss of 
information; such removal of bits from the first and
second bit streams is generally referred to in the art as
puncturing. Optimum puncturing codes for these bit
streams are disclosed by Yasuda et al., "Development of
Variable-Rate Viterbi Decoder and its Performance
Characteristics," 6th International Conference on Digital
Satellite Communications, Phoenix, Arizona, September
1983. Yasuda et at. discloses optimal puncturing rates
from 2/3 to 16/17. The 2/3 puncturing code or rate is
represented by:
1011Lines 1 and 2 of Table I respectively indicate
puncturing operations performed on the bits of the first
and second bit streams. The first place in line 1
indicates the puncturing operations to be performed on
bits P1(0), P1(2), P1(4) etc. of the first bit stream;
the second place in line 1 indicates puncturing
operations performed on bits P1(1), P1(3), P1(5) etc. of
the first bit stream; the first place in line 2 of Table
I indicates the puncturing operations performed on bits
P2(0), P2(2), P2(4) etc. of the second bit stream; the
second place in line 2 indicates the operations on bits
P2(1), P2(3), P2(5) etc. Values of 1 and 0 in Table I
respectively indicate there is no puncturing and there is
