<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cable sleeve comprising a sleeve tube (MR) and end sealing bodies (DK). The insertion diameter of the insertion openings (E) is matched to the diameter of the cables (K) to be inserted with the aid of sealing body inserts (DE) which are inserted into large insertion openings in the sealing bodies (DK) or into insertion openings, which are provided specifically for this purpose, in the sealing bodies (DK). The sealing in the separating planes is carried out using corresponding sealing means, which are known per se.
