<ABSTRACT>
An addition curing type silicone rubber 
composition comprising an aliphatic unsaturated 

group - containing organopolysiloxane, an 
organohydrogenpolysiloxane and a platinum series 

catalyst is further blended with a triazine or 
sulfide control agent to provide a composition 

which is stable and resistant against premature 
gelation at room temperature and thus has long-term 

storage stability. Heating causes the 
composition to be quickly vulcanized at an 

acceptable rate into a silicone rubber having 
satisfactory physical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This disclosure relates to addition-curing type
silicone rubber compositions using a platinum series
catalyst, and more particularly, to silicone rubber
compositions which are stabilised against premature
gelation.Conventional silicone rubber compositions
are loaded with platinum series catalysts for
promoting addition reaction between an aliphatic
unsaturated group-containing organopolysiloxane
and an organohydrogenpolysiloxane. The
crosslinking rate of this addition reaction is
generally high albeit some dependency on the
activity of the catalysts. As a consequence,
control agents or curing inhibitors are added to
most compositions for preventing premature
gelation at room temperature, thereby imparting
potential curability to the compositions in the 
sense that the compositions are stable and remain
unchanged over a long period of time, but can be
cured by heating.Known such control agents are
ethylenically unsaturated isocyanurates and
compounds having a hydroperoxide -C-O-O-H
structure as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication (JP-B) Nos. 41626/1980 and
20340/1982. However, the former control agents
are less effective for controlling the platinum
series catalysts. The latter control agents
must be added in a carefully controlled amount
because otherwise vulcanization does not take
place or the vulcanization rate is slow.For preventing premature gelation at room
temperature, it is also proposed to contain the
platinum series catalyst and the organohydrogenpolysiloxane
in separate packs which are
mixed on use. This requires an additional
operation of mixing two components.Although a number of premature gelation
inhibitors are currently available, many control
agents, typically acetylene alcohol agents are
volatile. Since they lose control ability by
volatilization, they cannot survive over a long 
working life. Such control agents must be added in
excess of the necessity.A general aim addressed herein is the provision of
new addition-curing silicone rubber compositions having
cure control means for stabilising against premature
gelation. Proposed and particular aims include
(independently) the ability to provide the composition in
one-pack form, long working life, and good workability.Another general aim is to propose new and useful
uses of compounds as cure control agents in such a
context.A first aspect of the invention is a silicone rubber
composition comprising
(A) organopolysiloxane of the following average
