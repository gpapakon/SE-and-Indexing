<ABSTRACT>
A control system is described for applying pulse width 
modulated (PWM) control signals to the dampers of a motor 

vehicle having variable rate dampers. The control signals 

applied to the dampers having a constant frequency and a 
variable mark to space ratio. In order to reduce the 

ripple component of the sum of the currents drawn from the 
vehicle power supply, the control signals applied to the 

different dampers are out of phase with one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor vehicle having 
variable rate dampers and a control system for applying 
pulse width modulated (PWM) control signals to the dampers. The ride of a motor vehicle is strongly affected by the 
rate of the dampers and adaptive damping systems have been 
proposed in which the damping rate may be varied with 
driving conditions. Dampers are known with a solenoid 
operated valve in their hydraulic circuit, both on/off and 
continuously variable solenoid valves having been 
previously proposed. Though continuously variable solenoid valves can be 
controlled by means of analogue signals, it is preferred in 
some systems such as the system disclosed in FR-A-2588343 
to use digital pulse width modulation to 
regulate the mean current flowing through the solenoid. 
However, it has been found that such control gives rise to 
serious problems on account of electrical noise that can 
affect other electrical equipment in the vehicle. The object of the present invention is to reduce the 
electrical noise generated when controlling the variable 
rate dampers using pulse width modulated signals. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
motor vehicle having variable rate dampers and a control 
system for applying pulse width modulated (PWM) control 
signals to the dampers, the control signals applied to the 
dampers having a constant frequency and a variable mark to 
space ratio, characterised in that the control signals 
applied by the control system to the different dampers are 
out of phase with one another so as to reduce the ripple 
component of the sum of the currents drawn from the vehicle 
power supply.  
 Conventionally, all the dampers are controlled in phase so 
that periods in which current is drawn by all electrical 
elements are followed by periods of no current being drawn 
by any of the elements. By phase shifting the control 
signals of the dampers relative to one another, the present 
invention balances the electrical load more evenly in that 
the current drawn by the different dampers will be 
staggered within each cycle thereby reducing the ripple or 
a.c. component. Any fluctuating current can be regarded as 
an a.c. current superimposed on a d.c. offset and in the 
present invention, the amplitude of the a.c. component is 
reduced, when compared to a system in which all elements 
are operated in phase with one another. It will be appreciated that there are two sources of 
electrical noise, one resulting from conduction and the 
other from
