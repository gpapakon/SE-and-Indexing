<ABSTRACT>
A conjugate compound comprises at least one heat shock protein or portion thereof including at least one immunostimulatory domain and at least one capsular oligosaccharide or polysaccharide of a pathogenic bacteria. The compound comprises oligosaccharides of the Meningococci C (MenC) group and a heat shock protein selected from M. bovis BCG GroEl-type 65kDa hsp (hspR65), recombinant M. tuberculosis DnaK-type 70kDa hsp (hspR70) and a heat shock protein from H. pylori. The conjugate compounds are useful in the preparation of vaccines to prevent bacterial infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to conjugated compounds 
consisting of heat shock proteins and polysaccharides or 
oligosaccharides, in particular those polysacccharides or 
oligosaccharides derived from the capsule of pathogenic 
microorganisms. Such compounds are capable of inducing the 
formation of anti-polysaccharide antibodies and are 
accordingly useful as vaccines for use in man and in 
animals. Bacteria are the aetiological agents for a wide range of 
disease conditions. Examples of such diseases include meningitis caused by 
Neisseria meningitidis and other infections caused by 
Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) or Streptococcus 
(including Pneumococcus), typhoid fever caused by 
infection with Salmonella typhi, intestinal disease caused 
by non-typoidal Salmonella or Shigella bacteria. It is known that protective immunity to capsular bacteria 
is mediated by antibodies to the capsular polysaccharides. 
It is also known that, in order to obtain sufficient 
stimulation of the immune system, it is necessary to 
conjugate capsular polysaccharides to carrier proteins 
(Robbins et al, J. Infect. Dis., 1990, 161, 821-832). In particular, there have been described in the literature 
conjugated compounds consisting of polysaccharides (for 
example Group C meningococcal polysaccharide (MenC), Hib  
 
and Group A meningococcal polysaccharide (MenA)) and 
proteins such as CRM-197 (a peptide derived from 
Corynebacterium diphtheriae), TD (Diphtheria toxoid) or TT 
(Tetanus toxoid - see Peeters et al. Inf.Immun., 
(Oct.1991), 3504-3510; Claesson et al., J. Pediatrics St 
Louis, 112(5), 695-702, (May 1988). Some such vaccines are already used with good results in 
clinical practice. However, there exists the need to 
identify novel protein carriers which impart to the 
conjugates immunogenic properties better than those 
achieved with the carriers used hitherto. The present invention relates to the use of heat shock 
proteins as a protein carrier to increase the immunogenic 
response of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Heat shock proteins are known to contain a significant 
number of T epitopes and thus to stimulate the cellular 
immune system. A conjugated compound of the heat shock protein of 
Mycobacterium bovis (65 kDa), as a carrier for a malarial 
epitope, has been described as inducing a marked immunity 
in animals pre-immunised with Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin 
(BCG) without requiring adjuvants (Lussow et al Eur. J. 
Immunol., 1991, 21,2297-2302). It is however to be noted 
that the effects
