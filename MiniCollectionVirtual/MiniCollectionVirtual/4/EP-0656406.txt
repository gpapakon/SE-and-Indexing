<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a water-based ink composition 
comprising coloring material particles obtained by causing 

a dye to be adsorbed on or bonded to fine particles or an 
inorganic colloidal substance, and an aqueous solution of 

a water-soluble polymer dispersing the coloring material 
particles therein, wherein the polymer chains of the 

polymer in the composition undergo dissociation or 
association by its temperature change or pH change.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink, in
particular, an ink suitable for use in ink-jet recording,
and an ink-jet recording method using such an ink and ink-jet
instruments containing the ink therein.Water-based inks have heretofore been principally
used as ink-jet recording inks from the viewpoint of
safety, odor and the like. There have been known inks in
which one or more of various water-soluble dyes or
pigments are dissolved or dispersed in water or a mixed
solvent of_water and a water-soluble organic solvent, and
a humectant, a dye-dissolving aid, a mildewproofing agent
and/or the like are added thereto as needed. For the past
few years, ink-jet recording has conspicuously spread
because it has such many advantages as an ink can be
ejected in a proportion of several thousand droplets per
second to conduct high-speed recording with ease, noise is
scarcely produced, multi-color recording can be performed
with ease, high-resolution recording can be effected, and
recording can be conducted on plain paper.With the development of low-cost and high-performance 
personal computers and the standardization of
GUI environment in recent years, even image recording by
printers or the like has been required to achieve high
coloring, high quality, good fastness properties, high-resolution
recording and high-speed recording. A
technical idea that a coloring material component having
high water fastness is left on the surface of paper as
much as possible, edges of printed dots are made sharp,
and the occurrence of feathering is also lessened is being
proposed.M. Croucher et al. have indicated problems involved
in the conventional homogeneous inks and moreover
proposed, as an ink for ink-jet, a heterogeneous ink
making use of a latex. [M. Croucher and M. Hair, Ind. Eng.
Chem. Res., 28, 1712-1718 (1989)].U. S. Patent No. 4,246,154 discloses an ink in which
fine particles of a vinyl polymer are colored with a dye
and anionically stabilized. U. S. Patent No. 4,680,332
discloses a heterogeneous ink in which a water-insoluble
polymer containing an oil-soluble dye and combined with a
nonionic stabilizer is dispersed in a liquid medium. In
U. S. Patent No. 5,100,471, there has also been proposed a
water-based ink comprising a solvent and colored particles
composed of a polymer core and a silica shell to which a
dye has been bonded by covalent bonding. This ink has
such features as a brighter color is developed on paper, 
temperature stability is good, and water fastness is
excellent.On the other hand, Japanese Patent
