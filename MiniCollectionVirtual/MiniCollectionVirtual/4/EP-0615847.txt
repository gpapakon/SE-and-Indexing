<ABSTRACT>
An image processing device comprises input means (103) for 
inputting a plurality of image data of
 colour components 
successively and repeatedly as synchronized with a 

predetermined clock (102) while memory means (104) memorise the image 
data following a given address. Address generating means (105) 

generate addresses in synchronization with the 
predetermined clock and a bit of the colour components as 

an upper bit of the address.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image processing device.In the prior art, in a recording device of
the dot recording system, recording scanning is
generally performed with a recording head capable 
of dot recording of about 24 dots.When the recording dot number in one row
is made a number exceeding 100 for enhancing recording
speed, the driving circuits for driving the recording
sections corresponding to these dots are also
required in number corresponding to the dots. As
the result, the drive circuit as a whole becomes
larger, leading to elevation in cost, enlargement of
machines. For solving this problem, it may be
conceivable to divide the recording head section
into blocks, driving the respective recording
sections divided into blocks by time division,
thereby reducing the dot number driven at the same
time by the drive circuit.Fig. 1A shows the block division contents of
a liquid jet recording head of the prior art.In Fig. 1A, 128 discharge openings are
divided into 16 blocks and the recording sections
101 to 116 of 16 blocks are arrayed in one row.
Accordingly, each recording section has ink
discharge openings corresponding to 8 dots as shown
in Fig. 1B. Such recording sections 101 - 116 are
driven by time division, and 8 dots are dot recorded
at the same time. When ink is discharged through
all the discharge openings by moving the recording
in the main scanning direction at a constant speed,
the interval from the recorded image of the first 
block to the recorded image of the 16th block
becomes approximate to 60 µm when the recording
density is set at 400 DPI (dot/inch) (Fig. 1C).Further, the dot interval between adjacent
blocks is 4 µm which is as large as corresponding
to the size of about one picture element. Accordingly,
for making smaller the slippage of recording dots
by such time division recording, the recording
head is located obliquely as shown in Fig. 2A for
carrying out recording scanning. And, as shown in
Fig. 2B, it has been proposed to perform recording
of the respective dot rows in one row by tolerating
only slanting of the dot rows of the respective
blocks. The block actuation order at this time is
shown in Fig. 3. The arrowhead A shows the main
scanning direction (going way direction) of the
recording head and the arrowhead B slanted angle.However, in the recording device of this
kind of the prior art, for increasing the speed of
recording or obtaining mirror image, returning way
recording may be sometimes practiced. In this case,
in the recording device of the prior art, since
