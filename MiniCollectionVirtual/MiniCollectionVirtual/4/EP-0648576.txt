<ABSTRACT>
The abrasive lining for abrasive tools, especially abrasive wheels, comprises resin-bonded grinding studs formed by granulation or the like of metallic- or ceramic-bonded or similarly bonded, hot-pressed or pressureless-sintered abrasive with diamond or CBN grit. An abrasive wheel with such an abrasive lining is distinguished in particular by large chip spaces, high abrasion resistance, self-sharpening, higher loadability and direct connection of the abrasive lining to the carrier, inter alia.

<CLAIMS>
Abrasive lining for abrasive tool, in particular grinding wheels, with grinding 
micro segment size arising from crushing of metal or ceramic bonded, hot-pressed 

or sintered abrasives with diamond or CBN grit,
 
characterized in that the grinding micro segments (13) bonded by resin binder 

(15) and infiltrated with diamond or CBN grit, wherein the grit material has a 
concentration in the agglomerate which does not exceed 8,8 per cubic 

centimeter (FEPA K200 or 480V) and wherein the plurality of grinding micro 
segments have a volume percent in the grinding rim which ranges from about 30 

to 60%. 
Abrasive lining according to claim 1, characterized in that the diamond or 
CBN grit size is MD20 (20 microns) to D301 (50/60 Mesh) or MB20 (20 microns) 

to D427 (40/50 Mesh). 
Abrasive lining according to claim 1, characterized in that the plurality of 
grinding micro segments are micropellets having a pellet size which ranges from 

Â¼ to 3 mm.
