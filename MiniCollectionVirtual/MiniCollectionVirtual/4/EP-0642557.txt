<ABSTRACT>
The rheological properties of latexes and latex paint formulations thickened with non-urethane thickeners according to the invention are modified by adding to the latex or latex paint formulation an amount of a nonionic surfactant having an HLB value of from 4 to about 20 sufficient to decrease the low shear viscosity of the thickened latex without a corresponding reduction in the high shear viscosity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the modification of the
rheological properties of polymer latexes. More
specifically, the invention relates to a method of
modifying the flow and leveling of latex paints thickened
with non-urethane associative thickeners.Many aqueous systems require thickeners in order to be
useful for various types of applications. Such aqueous-based
systems as cosmetics, protective coatings for paper
and metal, printing inks, and latex paints all require the
incorporation of thickeners in order to have the proper
rheological characteristics for their particular uses. Many
substances useful as thickeners are known in the art. These
include natural polymers such as casein and alginates, and
synthetic materials such as cellulose derivatives, acrylic
polymers, and polyurethane polymers. The most preferred
thickeners for latexes, especially latex paints, are the
associative thickeners which are water-soluble polymers
which contain hydrophobic groups. While the mechanism of
how associative thickeners thicken and otherwise modify the
rheological properties of latexes is not known, there are 
a number of theories which are set forth in U.S. patent
4,426,485.
Polyurethane-based thickeners are
recognized in the art as the best among the associative
thickeners. The use of polyurethane-based thickeners in
various applications is discussed in the Journal of
Coatings Technology, Volume 64, number 804, pages 87-94
(1992) and taught in U.S. patents 4,079,028, 4,155,892,
4,499,233, and 4,426,485. Surface Coatings Australia,
22(10), 6, (1985) teaches that anionic and nonionic
surfactants reduce the low shear viscosity of a latex
thickened with a polyurethane-based associative thickener
while having a relatively small effect of the high shear
viscosity. The foregoing reference contains no teaching
that nonionic surfactants in general, and alkyl
polyglycoside surfactants, in particular, reduce the low
shear viscosity of a latex thickened with one or more of
the non-urethane compounds disclosed herein while having
little or no effect of the high shear viscosity.It has recently been discovered that a class of non-urethane
compounds performs as well as polyurethane-based
thickeners in latex paint applications. These compounds are
disclosed in copending patent application serial number
07/787,905 filed on 11/07/91 (issued as U.S. patent 5,728,895). It has been found that in
some instances that the performance of non-urethane
thickeners must be modified in order to meet specific
requirements. For example, certain
