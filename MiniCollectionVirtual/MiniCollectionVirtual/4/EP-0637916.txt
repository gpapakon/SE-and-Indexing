The compounds are producible by cultivation of a strain of the fungus Curvularia sp., or Septoria sp., and optional chemical modification. The compounds may also be used for controlling fungi in the preservation of wood, paints, cosmetics, and edible products.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: AGRICULTURAL USE OF CERTAIN COMPOUNDS, COMPOSI¬ TIONS AND METHODS FOR PRODUCING SAID COMPOUNDSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the use of certain compounds in agriculture or horticulture, compositions containing said compounds, and the use of such compositions for controlling fungi in valuable crops, and in the preservation of wood and timber, paints, cosmetics, foods and feeds, methods for producing the fungicidally active compounds, and microorganisms capable of producing said compounds.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCertain compounds have been disclosed in European Publication No. EP 360 760 (Sandoz AG), published 28.3.1990. These compounds are disclosed as having interesting pharmacological properties, especially for use as chemotherapeutic drug resistance reversing and to some extent immunosuppressant and antiinflammatory agents. It is also stated that the compounds have an antifungal activity in animals against yeast and yeast-like species causing systemic attacks. The publication contains only reference to one test against Candida, and indicates that the com¬ pounds also may have activity against yeast like species causing systemic attacks in animals. No reference is made to which of the 82 exemplified compounds were tested for this activity, but in EP 360 760 it is stated that the most preferred compound can be represented by the formula:cyclo-[Pec-MeVal-Val-MeAsp-MeIle-MeIle-Gly-MeVal-TyrOMe-D-Lact](Example 1, first compound). 

 This compound is together with some other related compounds according to EP 360 760 produced by the fungal genus Septoria.For a number of years it has been known that various microorganisms produce metabolites exhibiting biological activity so as to be useful as biocides for combating diseases and pests.Especially it has been known that some species of the genus Curvularia produce dif¬ ferent metabolites exhibiting biological activity, in particular as phytotoxins. However, none of these metabolites are known to be fungicides. C. lunata (Wakk.) Boed was found to produce at least two phytotoxins. They cause necrotic spots on plant leaves even when they are highly diluted. (F. Macri and A. Vianello, Physio¬ logical Plant Pathology 8:325-331, 1976). The toxins are phytotoxins and are non host specific. Host specific toxins have been isolated from culture filtrates of C. pallescens Boedijn and from diseased host leaves attacked by this species (Olufolaji, Cryptogamie Mycol. 7(4):335-342, 1986). These toxic substances gave chlorotic spots to maize plants.
