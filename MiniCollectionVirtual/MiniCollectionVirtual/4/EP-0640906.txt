<ABSTRACT>
The shapes of a plurality of parts are displayed 
simultaneously on a display screen. When the shape of 

one of the parts is designated in a "hide" mode, the 
display of the shape of this part is inhibited and an 

icon is displayed in its place. When the icon is 
designated in a "show" mode, the icon is erased and the 

shape of the original member is re-displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a display apparatus and
display control method used in, say, a CAD (computer
aided design) system utilized when designing machines or
the like.In a case where any desired part shape on the
display of a CAD system capable of displaying a
plurality of parts is desired to be hidden or removed
from the display, one method used in the prior art is to
designate the part name or group name of the part using
a keyboard or mouse. Another method is to directly
designate a displayed part on the display screen using a
pointing device such as a mouse, thereby hiding the
designated part shape.Conversely, in order to re-display the shape of a
part already hidden, the part name or group name is
designated by a mouse or keyboard, thereby causing the
designated part to be shown again.In a case where machine design is performed using a
CAD system, the design of the arrangement layout of the
constituent parts or constituent units of the particular
machine is carried out. At such time the designer takes
into account the positional relationship of the
surrounding parts as well as the positional relationship 
between units and the shapes of the parts and decides
shape and arrangement in such a manner that the parts and
units will not interfere with one another.In layout design for deciding shape and arrangement
of a plurality of parts an a trial-and-error basis, the
associated parts frequently are displayed or hidden (not
displayed). When an instruction for displaying or hiding
a figure representing a shape is made in the conventional
display apparatus, it is required that the designer be
aware of and use the identifiers of part names in order
to specify the parts. This means that it is difficult for
the designer to specify parts directly. As a consequence,
designating whether figures should be displayed or erased
in the conventional display apparatus is not easy. In
other words, the user interface is not always
satisfactory.In "Automatic Window Management Mode", IBM Technical
Disclosure Bulletin, vol. 35, no. 4B, 1 September 1992,
pages 331-332, XP000313970, a technique for software
windowing systems to overcome difficulties with
excessive, overlapping windows is described. In a
specific mode all inactive windows are automatically
reduced to icons being displayed approximately where the
full-sized windows were. No icon is positioned such that
it is covered by the currently active window. The
currently active window is automatically minimized if the
user moves a mouse pointer outside of the active

converting means responsive to said first designating
means (
6
) for converting the centroid position of the
displayed shape of the designated member from a relative

position read from said memory means to absolute
coordinates on a display screen of the display means (
4
);
said identifier being displayed in the vicinity of the
centroid position obtained by said converting means.
The apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said control
means (
2
) has arithmetic means responsive to said first
designating means (
6
) for calculating the centroid position
of the displayed shape of the designated member on the

basis of absolute coordinates on a display screen of the
display means (
4
);

   said identifier being displayed in the vicinity of the
centroid position calculated by said arithmetic means.

) is operable.
The apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: 

first instructing means for instructing, when display
of a member has been replaced by display of the

corresponding identifier, to hide display of the identifier
and display the shape figure of the original member; and
second designating means responsive to an instruction
from said first instructing means for designating an

identifier on a display screen of the display means (
