At the rear, the shoe has a vertical notch, the bottom of which is located substantially above the calcaneum (heel bone), in the zone of the Achilles tendon, at a height of 8 to 15 cm above the sole of the shoe. The shoe preferably has a tongue (8) extending over the notch. This shoe holds the heel well and also makes it easier to put the shoe on and take it off.
