<ABSTRACT>
The multi-unit pack 50 proposed, consisting of a plurality of individual soft packages 3, in particular for drinking liquids, is characterised by bonding of the aligned soft packages by means of a plurality of adhesive spots or small adhesive areas. A heated melt adhesive is sprayed from an adhesive dispenser 20 onto one of the surfaces of the soft packages to be connected after they have passed through a separating device 5, whereupon the individual packs 5 of the group are aligned in an aligning station 30 and are pressed together in a longitudinal pressing device 40 until the adhesive points have become firm. These stations are located on a lateral conveyor belt 33, arranged at the side of the main conveyor belt 1, from where the finished multi-unit packs 50 are guided back onto the main conveyor belt 1 by a guiding device 55.

A method for producing multiple-unit packs 
from a plurality of cuboid single packs, in which the 

single packs are successively connected to each other 
with the same orientation along a line in such a way 

that even side surfaces of adjacent single packs have 
contact with each other and are glued by means of a 

plurality of spots of adhesive or individual areas of 
adhesive, characterized in that 


the single packs are filled with liquid 
and first of all are aligned in an inlet path of a 
separating device at defined distances, 
hot adhesive is sprayed on to an even side surface 
provided for the joining, 
the individual soft packs are aligned, while 
maintaining a distance between the surfaces to be 

glued, at right angles to the longitudinal extent 
of the multiple-unit pack to be produced and are 

supported on both sides and 
finally, by way of force-loading the end samples 
of the soft packs, are brought into contact with 

each other in the direction of the longitudinal 
extent and are pressed together until the adhesive 

has set. 
A device for carrying out the method according 
to claim 1, having an inlet path which has a separating 

device (5), which separates at defined distances the 
single packs (3) arriving aligned in the direction of 

the longitudinal extent of the multiple-unit pack to be 
produced, and an adhesive dispenser (20) applying a 

plurality of spots of adhesive on to one or both 
surfaces to be joined, characterized by a subsequent 

alignment station (30) in which an aligning plate (37), 
which can be displaced in a drivable manner in the 

transverse direction, presses the single packs 
belonging to a multiple-unit pack to be produced  

 
against a transverse stop plate (35) and aligns them, 

and a longitudinal compression device which compresses 
the aligned single packs in the longitudinal direction 

until contact and until the spots of adhesive have set. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the alignment station (30) has a side conveyor 

belt (33) arranged at the side of the main conveyor 
belt (1) and the aligning plate (37) pushes the single 

packs to be joined to form a multiple-unit pack, upon 
the release of the main conveyor belt, to the side on 

to the side conveyor belt (33) and in that the 
longitudinal compression device (40) has a longitudinal 

stop plate (41), which can be pulled back, and a 
compression stamp (45). 
A device according to claims 2 and/or 3, 
characterized by two alignment and compression stations 

arranged on both sides of the main central conveyor 
belt and each having a transverse stop plate (35) 

representing its outer limit, whereby the aligning 
plate (37) can be driven for the alternate transverse 

displacement of the single packs of a multiple-unit 
pack to be produced and a longitudinal compression 

device (40) is allocated to each alignment station 
(30). 
A device according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the longitudinal stop plates (41) at the front 

end of the aligning plate (37) in the conveying 
direction are arranged at right angles to its extent 

and form a T-shape therewith when viewed from above. 
A device according to one or more of claims 2 
to 5, characterized by pneumatic cylinders (39; 43) as 

the driving elements of the aligning plate (37) and the 
compression stamps (45). 
A device according to one or more of claims 2 
to 6, characterized by directing guides (55) which 

guide the multiple-unit packs (50) coming out of the  
 

alignment stations back to the main central conveyor 
belt (1) again. 
A device according to one or more of claims 2 
to 7, characterized in that the adhesive dispenser (20) 

is arranged at the side of the main conveyor belt (1) 
between the separating device (5) and the alignment 

station (30) and sprays the adhesive on to one of the 
surfaces to be joined.
