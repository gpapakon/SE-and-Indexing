<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for 
recording image information. New technologies have been developed in the field of 
recording information. One known example of such new 
technologies generates a charge latent image in a charge 
storage recording medium on the basis of an input optical 
image by use of a photoelectric transducer device including a 
photoconductive member. EP-A-0 342 058 describes a method and an apparatus for 
recording information comprising the features of the 
preambles of claims 1, 4 and 5. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved 
method of recording information. It is another object of this invention to provide an improved 
apparatus for recording information. These objects are achieved as to the method by a method 
comprising the measures mentioned in claim 1, and as for the 
apparatus, by an apparatus having the features indicated in 
claim 4 or 5. The invention is further developed by the features mentioned 
in the subclaims.
