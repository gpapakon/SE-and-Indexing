<ABSTRACT>
In a folding device, it is to be ensured that outer edges, running parallel to the conveying direction, of the signatures of variable width are sufficiently covered by conveyor belts (41; 42; 43; 44; 45; 46) of a belt conveying system so that, in the event of the grippers (17) arranged on the collecting cylinder (16) continuing to grip, the leading ends of the signatures remain undamaged. This takes place due to the fact that the strip (6) of the paper web which can be divided into signatures is displaceable in the axial direction of the collecting cylinder by at least one belt width. In this case, a width of the conveyor belts (b) is equal to or greater than a gap (i) between the belts.

A folding device having at least one collecting cylinder 
(16) which is equipped with gripper systems (17) and folding 

knife systems (18) and cooperates with a folding jaw cylinder 
(20), in which distributed over the entire working width of the 

folding device a plurality of conveyor belt systems (13, 14), 
comprising driven belts (41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46) arranged 

parallel to one another, are provided to guide the signatures 
(11) which are to be folded and are guided, and the signatures 

(11, 12) can have a width (f) which is optionally smaller than 
the maximum possible working width (e) of the folding device (16, 

20), characterized in that, before entering a device (7, 8) for 
transverse cutting, a paper web strip (6) is arranged to be 

displaceable in the direction (G) parallel to the axis with 
respect to the rotational axis (39) of the collecting cylinder 

(16), and in that a width (b) of the belts (41 to 46) having the 
same width as one another is equal to or greater than a gap (i) 

between them in each case. 
A folding device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the paper web strip (6) is displaceable at least by a belt width 

(b) of the belts. 
A folding device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, to displace the paper web strip (6), at least one turning 

rod (63), inclined at an angle (Alpha) of 45Â° to the axis (39) of 
the collecting cylinder (16), is arranged to be displaceable in 

the axial direction (G) of the collecting cylinder (16). 
A folding device according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that a drive (69, 71, 67) for displacing the turning rod (63) 

is connected to a computer (73). 
A folding device according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized  
 

in that there is arranged a device (2, 5) for longitudinal 
folding which is displaceable in the axial direction (G) with 

respect to the collecting cylinder (16), and in that the 
rotational axes of the folding rollers (5) arranged at the former 

delivery point (2) of the device (2, 5) for longitudinal folding 
run parallel to the rotational axis (39) of the collecting 

cylinder (16). 
A folding device according to Claim 5, characterized in that 
a drive (69, 71, 67) for displacing the device (2, 5) for 

longitudinal folding is connected to a computer.
