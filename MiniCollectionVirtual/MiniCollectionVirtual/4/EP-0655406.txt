<ABSTRACT>
A feeding device for web material, having a pneumatic 
actuator assembly (B) incorporating a three-way 

pneumatically piloted control valve (8) which controls 
the communication between the pneumatic actuator 

assembly (B) and, respectively, a source of air under 
pressure (A) and a discharge port (C). The control 

valve (8) comprises a floating obturator (30) defining 
a first and a second face seal surfaces (31, 32) for 

airtight closure of the feed line (A) in presence of 
the piloting pressure, and of the discharge line (C) in 

the absence of the piloting pressure, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally related to feeding 
of webs of any material towards a work station, 
particularly but not exclusively to a forming press. More particularly, the invention is directed to a 
feeding device for web material, of the type comprising 
step-feed means of the web along a longitudinal 
direction comprising a stationary gripper and a movable 
gripper, a pneumatic actuator assembly for operating 
linear alternative forward and back displacement of the 
movable gripper relative to the stationary gripper 
parallelly to said longitudinal direction and opening 
and closure of said grippers in synchronism with the 
alternative displacement of the movable gripper, and an 
adjustable stop member cooperating with the movable 
gripper at the end of the forward displacement thereof. 
In such feeding devices the pneumatic actuator assembly 
traditionally comprises a block incorporating a three-way 
pneumatically piloted control valve, which controls 
the communication between said pneumatic actuator 
assembly and, respectively, a source of air under 
pressure and a discharge port. Feeding devices of the above mentioned type are 
currently manufactured and marketed for instance by 
ELMER of Turin, Italy and are also generally known from US-A-4,175,688. 
In these known feeding devices, 
the control valve traditionally comprises a hollow body 
having an inlet axial passage communicating with a 
feeding line from said pressurised air source, a radial 
inlet passage communicating with a pneumatic piloting 
line, a first and a second radial outlet passages 
respectively communicating with the pneumatic actuator 
assembly and with the discharge, and a spool having at 
one end thereof a plunger subject to the pressure from 
the piloting line, and having at the other end thereof  
 
a floating obturator which, in presence of the piloting 
pressure, face-sealingly closes said inlet axial 
passage and opens the communication between the first 
and the second radial outlet passages, and in the 
absence of the piloting pressure closes the second 
radial outlet passage and opens the communication 
between the inlet axial passage and the first radial 
outlet passage. In other words, in presence of piloting 
pressure the pneumatic actuator assembly controlled by 
the valve is connected to the discharge, while in the 
absence of piloting pressure the pneumatic actuator 
assembly is connected to the source of air under 
pressure. A feeding device for web material according to the 
prior art, provided with

<CLAIMS>
A feed device (1) for feeding a web material to a 
work station, particularly a forming press, comprising 

step-feed means of the web along a longitudinal direction 
(F) comprising a stationary gripper (3) and a movable 

gripper (4), a pneumatic actuator assembly (B) for 
operating linear alternative forward and back 

displacement of the movable gripper (4) relative to the 
stationary gripper (3) parallelly to said longitudinal 

direction (F) and opening and closure of said grippers In 
synchronism with the alternative displacement of the 

movable gripper (4), and an adjustable stop member (6) 
cooperating with the movable gripper (4) at the end of 

the forward displacement thereof, and wherein said 

pneumatic actuator assembly (B) comprises a block (2) 
incorporating a three-way pneumatically piloted control 

valve (8) controlling the communication between said 
pneumatic actuator assembly and, respectively, a source 

of air under pressure (A) and a discharge (C), said 
control valve (8) comprising a hollow body (9) having an 

axial inlet passage (13) in communication with a feed 
line (A) from said source of air under pressure, a radial 

inlet passage (14) in communication with a pneumatic 
piloting line (D), and a first and a second radial outlet 

passages (16, 17) communicating respectively with the 
pneumatic actuator assembly (B) and with the discharge 

(C), and a spool (19) having at one end thereof a plunger 
(20) subject to the pressure from the piloting line (D) 

and at the other end thereof a floating obturator (30) 
with a first face seal surface, 

which, in presence of the piloting pressure, face 
sealingly closes said axial inlet passage (13) and opens 

the communication between the first and the second radial 
outlet passages (16, 17), and in the absence of the 

piloting pressure closes the second radial outlet passage 
(17) and opens the communication between the axial inlet  

 
passage (13) and the first radial outlet passage (16), 

characterised in that the obturator (30) of the control 
valve (8) is formed with a second face seal surface (32) 

sealingly engaging axially, in the absence of the 
piloting pressure, a corresponding face seal surface 

(29) of the valve body (9) for closure of said second 
outlet passage (17). 
A feed device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that: 


the body (9) of the control valve (8) has a first 
chamber (11) in which said plunger (20) of the spool (19) 

is sealingly slidable axially, a second chamber (27) in 
which said floating obturator (30) is axially movable, 

and an intermediate cavity (26) between said first and 
second chambers (11, 27), the first chamber (11) being
