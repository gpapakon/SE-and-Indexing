<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transformer having a laminated core in the form of a frame, into whose central free space windings project which are grouped as n pairs, each composed of an inner high-voltage winding and an outer low-voltage winding located above it, around two of the opposite limbs of the laminated core, in particular for parallel operation with a plurality of supplying four-quadrant controllers. When a 16 2/3 Hz AC voltage is produced from a DC voltage by means of pulsed four-quadrant controllers, interfering current harmonics occur. In order to reduce the harmonics in a simple manner - that is to say without increasing the transformer costs, the transformer volume or the transformer weight - it is proposed according to the invention that one or more cruciform intermediate yokes (8) be inserted into the central free space (7) in the laminated core (6), which yokes divide the free space (7) into windows (9) for the individual winding pairs (1/3) in which these are inserted, and that the high-voltage windings (3) be connected in series.

Transformer with frame-shaped lamination stack (6) in which 
windings (1, 3) are arranged on two of its opposite limbs (4; 5) and 

in which the central free space (7) enclosed by the lamination stack 
(6) is subdivided by at least one cruciform intermediate yoke (8) 

into uniform individual windows (9), into which respectively 
associated windings (1; 3) project, wherein the cross-section of at 

least one intermediate yoke (8) amounts to a fraction of the cross-section 
of the limb (4; 5) in such a manner that the leakage between 

the low tension voltage windings (1, 3) is increased, characterised 
thereby that the windings (1, 3) are grouped on each of the opposite 

limbs (4; 5) as at least four winding parts (1; 3) each time of an 
inner high-tension voltage winding (3) and an outer low-tension 

voltage winding (1) disposed thereabove and that the high-tension 
voltage windings (3) are connected in series.
