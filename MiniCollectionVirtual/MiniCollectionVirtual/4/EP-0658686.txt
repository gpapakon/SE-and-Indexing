<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of cylinders (16) are defined in a single 
cylinder block (13), and a single cylinder head (14) common to the 

cylinders (16) is mounted on the cylinder block (13). Exhaust 
passages (32) are provided in the cylinder head (14) at a location 

corresponding to an inner side and central portion of a V-shape 
formed by the cylinders (16), the exhaust passages (32) 

communicating with the cylinders (16), respectively. Intake 
passages (19) are provided in the cylinder head (14) at a location 

corresponding to opposite outside positions of the V-shape, 
the intake passages (19) communicating with the 

cylinders (16), respectively. The intake passages (19) open into a 
side of the cylinder head (14) on opposite sides of the V-shape, 

and fuel injection nozzles (26) provided in the intake 
passages (19), respectively. The exhaust passage (32) extend 

parallel to a crankshaft (7) within the cylinder head (14) and open 
into the corresponding side of the cylinder head (14). A water 

jacket (74) is defined around the exhaust passages (32) to surround 
the exhaust passages (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engine of
relatively small size for use, for example, as an engine
for an outboard engine structure. The present invention
further relates to an outboard engine structure having a
small engine.An outboard engine is disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 267561/87. This
engine includes a crankshaft disposed vertically, and two
banks of cylinders disposed in an opposed V-shaped
configuration. Each of the banks includes a cylinder
block having three horizontal cylinders disposed in line
along an axis of a crankshaft, and a cylinder head secured
to an end face of the cylinder block in an axial direction
of the cylinders.Intake ports are locate on the inner sides of
the V-shaped banks. Intake pipes connected to the intake
ports extend in a direction away from the crankshaft at
least partially along a center line of the angle of the V
formed between the banks. A multi-barrel, single-chamber
carburetor is provided for every pair of opposed
cylinders.Exhaust ports are located on the outer sides of
the banks. Exhaust passages connected to the exhaust
ports, extend toward the crankshaft at least partially
along the axes of the cylinders, and then extend to meet
together in a single exhaust pipe.In such a prior art engine, an intake system
including the intake pipes and carburetors, is disposed on
the inner side of the V-shaped banks. Therefore, it is
difficult to reduce the angle formed between the banks
arranged in the V-shape for decreasing the width of the
engine, to thereby reduce the size of the engine.Further, to reduce the angle of the V between 
the banks, the carburetor would have to protrude away from
the crankshaft. This results in the problem that the
length of the engine is increased, and the center of
gravity of the engine itself is correspondingly displaced
in a direction away from a crank chamber, which is not
preferred depending upon conditions.There is another conventionally known multi-cylinder
engine intake device. In such a device, the same
number of intake pipes as that of cylinders extend from a
surge tank having a predetermined capacity, and the
cylinders are connected to intake ports. A fuel injection
device is disposed in each of the intake ports or in each
of the intake pipes in the vicinity of the intake port,
and a throttle valve is mounted on the surge tank for
controlling the amount of air drawn into the tank.Such an intake device is disclosed, for example,
in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 60024/93.

<CLAIMS>
An engine comprising:

a cylinder block (13);
a plurality of cylinders (16a-16d) located in said cylinder block, said cylinders being
oriented horizontally and configured into a V-shape;
a vertically oriented crankshaft (7) mounted on said cylinder block (13); and
a plurality of intake pipes (21a-21d) divided into two groups which extend along respective
opposite side portions of said cylinder block (13),
an oil filter (64) for lubricating oil mounted on one of said
opposite side portions of said cylinder block (13),
wherein one group of said cylinders (16a,
16b) is offset toward a higher side than the other group of cylinders (16c, 16d) and oil

pump means (58) for lubricating oil is mounted on the cylinder block (13) and positioned
beneath the higher group of cylinders (16a, 16b) on the same side of the cylinder block as

said oil filter (64) is disposed, and
wherein a single cylinder head (14) common to all cylinders has a valve
operating chamber (33) and an oil return passage (65a) is located below said higher group

of cylinders (16a, 16b) for returning lubricating oil from said valve operating chamber
(33) to said cylinder block (13).
