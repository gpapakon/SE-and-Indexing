<ABSTRACT>
A non-woven fabric in which large fiber bundles of 

the fabric intersect one another, small fiber bundles thereof 
intersect one another among said large fiber bundles, and the 

fibers of the fiber bundles are being entangled with one 
another among the large fiber bundles, among the small fiber 

bundles and at the intersecting points of the fiber bundles, 
may be manufactured by fluid-entangling fiber webs on a support 

member having large pores to obtain said large fiber bundles 
therein; and further fluid-entangling fiber webs of the 

resultant intermediate on a support member having small pores 
from either the same direction or the opposite direction to 

form said small fiber bundles therein. The non-woven fabric 
has excellent draping property, covering property and abrasion 

resistance and can be used as an interlining, as a base 
material for synthetic leathers, as a variety of base 

materials, as an interior material, as a simple garment, as a 
medical gown, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-woven fabric 
that has excellent draping property, covering property and 
abrasion resistance and can be used as an interlining, as a 
base material for synthetic leathers, as a variety of base 
materials, as an interior material, as a simple garment, as a 
medical gown, etc., and to a method of producing the same. An existing non-woven fabric having softness and, 
particularly, excellent shearing property, good covering 
property and high strength, can be represented by a patterned 
non-woven fabric prepared by a fluid-entangling method 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 20823/1974. 
This non-woven fabric is constituted by a first section 
comprising a number of entangled fibers 5, a second section 
comprising a group of fibers 6 coupling the first section, and 
a third section 4 where there exists either no fiber or a fiber 
at a low density (see Fig. 2). When the third section, where no fiber exists, is 
large, the non-woven fabric acquires a structure with large 
pores and exhibits excellent softness accompanied, however, by 
poor covering property. When the third section is small, the 
non-woven fabric exhibits excellent covering property but lacks 
softness and, particularly, shearing property. Japanese Patent Publication No. 6664/1979 discloses a 
non-woven fabric (see Fig. 3) of the structure of a woven 
texture in which fibers 9 and 10 are converged to form double  
 
layers 7 and 8 by entangling the fibers using a water stream 
from a nozzle of a porous diameter of 0.3 mm on a support 
member of 10 meshes or smaller. The fibers are then entangled 
on a support member of 18 meshes or smaller. The fibers are 
entangled between covering screens in both processes. This 
non-woven fabric forming the two layers 7 and 8, however, 
tends to become bulky or contains many voids when its weight is 
small. Clothing uses a variety of interlinings to utilize 
properties of a surface material and to reinforce weak 
points of the surface material. One of the examples can be 
represented by a non-woven interlining obtained by partly 
bonding the fiber webs by the application of heat and pressure 
without, however, exhibiting the draping property to a 
sufficient degree. Additionally, because of its poor extension 
recovering property, the non-woven fabric fails to follow the 
movement of the body. When the fiber webs are produced at an 
increased production rate, furthermore, the fibers tend to be 
oriented in the longitudinal direction (direction in which the
