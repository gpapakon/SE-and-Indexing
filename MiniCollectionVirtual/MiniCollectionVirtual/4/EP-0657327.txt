<ABSTRACT>
For roll-over bars which can be extended in a straight line and are not just extended in the event of a crash but can also be used for a so-called comfort operation, it is necessary that the nested tubes are kept without radial play even when actuated frequently. In addition, such axial guiding should only generate a small amount of friction. It is therefore proposed according to the invention to use guide bushes (1) for this purpose, which bushes (1) have a cylindrical central axial section (2) to both sides of which tongues (3) are moulded, the external curves (7) of which rest against the inner casing of the outer tube. On both axial sides the tongues (3) are respectively radially prestressed by a spring wire (5) which is bent to form an open ring. Whereas the central axial section (2), which is rigidly fastened to the inner tube, is in contact with the said inner tube over a large surface, the surface of contact between the tongues (3) and the outer tube is only very small, so that a large amount of friction is not generated.

<CLAIMS>
A guide bush (1, 101, 201, 301) of plastics material for supporting and axially guiding a
cylindrical body, without play, in a cylindrical cavity, for example an upright pipe (322) in a

hollow cylindrical arm (324) of a rectilinearly extensible roll bar (321) for motor vehicles,
comprising an axial portion (2) the internal contour of which is matched to and accordingly

rests against the external contour of the body, and comprising a plurality of tongues (3, 303)
which are integrally formed on both sides of the axial portion (2) and which are curved

radially outward and are resiliently oriented and biased outward, characterised in that

a set of tongues (3, 303) is integrally formed on each axial end of the axial portion (2), and
the tongues (3, 303) are provided with a convex curve (7) for resting against the inside wall of

the cavity, and
there is associated with each set of tongues a spring element in the form of a wire ring (5)
which rests against the periphery of the radial inner side of the associated tongues and

resiliently biases them radially outward.
A guide bush according to claim 1, characterised in that a set of at least four tongues (3)
is arranged at both axial ends, the width of each of which tongues in the circumferential

direction is greater than the distance to the adjacent tongues.
A guide bush according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that its cross-section forms a
closed ring.
A guide bush according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that its cross-section forms an
open ring, wherein the tongues bordering on the opening are not regarded as being adjacent.
A guide bush according to claim 4, characterised in that the opening occupies an angular
range smaller than 50Â°. 
A guide bush according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the wire ring
(5) is formed by an open ring of spring steel wire.
A guide bush according to claim 6, characterised in that the tongues (3) on which the
ends (8, 108) of the open ring (5) of spring steel wire are situated have projections (9, 109)

pointing radially inward.
A guide bush according to claim 4 or 5 and claim 6 or 7, characterised in that the ends
(208) of the open ring (5) of 
spring steel wire are bent radially outward at the edges (210) of
the opening.
