<ABSTRACT>
The device contains at least one fan (20) which is arranged in the vehicle body (1) of the rail traction unit and is connected to an air duct (17, 18) which is assigned to the traction motor (8) and/or to a cooling system (12) for assemblies (13). The air duct (17, 18) is provided over at least part of its length, e.g. in a suction-side section (17a, 18a, 43, 44) with panelling (38, 38a, 38b) which consists of a mat made of a sound-absorbing material. By means of the panelling (38, 38a, 38b) it is possible to achieve effective reduction in particular of the noise of the air of the fan (20) which is emitted in the direction of flow and counter to the direction of flow of the cooled air, and of the noise of flow within the air duct (17, 18). The device is mainly provided for use on railway traction units with high driving powers.

Apparatus for the ventilation of at least one vehicle
motor (8) and/or a cooler device (12) of a railway

locomotive having a vehicle body (1) which contains a
number of auxiliary aggregates (13) to be cooled,

comprising at least one ventilator (20) which is
connected to at least one air passage (17 or 18

respectively) which is associated with the vehicle
motor (8) and/or the cooler device (12), characterised

in that the air passage (17, 18) is provided with a
lining (38, 38a, 38b) of a sound absorbing material

facing the air flow at least along a portion of its
length.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1 comprising a
section (17a, 18a, 50) of the air passage (17, 18)

which is associated with the ventilator at the suction
side, characterised in that at least a portion of the

lining (38, 38b) is arranged in the suction side
section (17a, 18a, 50) of the air passage (17, 18).
Apparatus in accordance with claim 2 comprising a roof
cavity (21) which is formed in a roof part of the

vehicle body (1) and which can receive a flow via at
least one inlet opening (23) of the vehicle body (1)

and a passage opening (26, 27) to the suction side of
the ventilator (20) which is arranged in the base (25)

of the roof cavity (21), characterised in that at
least a portion of the suction side section (17a, 18a)

of the air passage (17, 18) is formed in the shape of
a hood part (43, 44) which covers the passage openings 

(26, 27) in the manner of a roof, through which a flow
can pass substantially in the longitudinal direction

of the vehicle body (1) and which has at least one
induction opening (45) for the coolant air; and in

that at least a portion of the lining (38) is arranged
in this hood part (43, 44).
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding
claims characterised in that the hood part (43, 44) is

provided with at least one rib-like guide element (47)
which extends parallel to the direction of flow, which

projects into the cross-section of the hood part (43,
44) through which the flow can pass and which consists

at least partly of the sound absorbing material of the
lining (38).
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding
claims characterised in that the lining (38, 38a, 38b)

is formed by at least one plate-shaped mat which
consists at least partly of an open-pored foam

material, e.g. of polyether.
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding
claims characterised in that on the side facing the

air flow the lining (38, 38a, 38b) is provided with a
cover (40) having cut-outs (41), e.g. in the form of a

perforated metal sheet.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 5 or claim 6
characterised in that the lining (38b) is formed in

the region of at least one longitudinal section (50)
of the air passage (18) by successive parts (51) of

the plate-shaped material which are stacked in the
manner of a sandwich in the direction of flow. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding
claims characterised in that, in at least one

longitudinal section (17b, 18b) of the air passage
(17, 18), at least a portion of the lining (38a) is

arranged at a distance from the wall (36, 37) of the
air passage (17, 18) through which the coolant air can

flow.
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding
claims characterised in that, in at least one

longitudinal section (18d) of the air passage (18), at
least a portion of the lining (38) is formed of at

least one lamella-shaped guide element (48) which
subdivides the cross-section of the air passage (18)

through which a flow can pass and which contains a
portion of the sound absorbing material of the lining

(38).
Locomotive with at least one apparatus in accordance
with one of the preceding claims.
