<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a storage device for a set of tools, for example spanners, characterised in that it is in the form of a rake (rack) formed mainly of:   - a support A consisting of a flat part (1) equipped at each side with racks (2), each element (3) of which ends in a return (3'); the support A also including two symmetric slideways (18), - a slide B formed from a base (10) equipped on each side with tabs (11) for interacting with the grooves (4) of the slideways (18) and including two racks (12), in which the mutual separation between the elements (13) corresponds to that of the elements of the racks (2) of the support A, - a locking/unlocking means making it possible to move the slide B from a position in which the tools are locked into a position in which they are unlocked and vice versa.   The device preferably further includes a tamper-proof means for immobilising the slide in the position in which the tools are locked.   The invention is of interest to the manufacturers and retailers of tools.
