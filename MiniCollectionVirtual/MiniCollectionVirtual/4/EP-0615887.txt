<ABSTRACT>
In a motor vehicle, an apparatus comprises a 
vehicle voltage supply (20) coupled to a supply node 

(34) through a diode (30), a step-up voltage supply 
(22) coupled between the vehicle voltage supply (20) 

and a single reserve capacitor (26), a diode (32) 
coupling the single reserve capacitor (26) to the 

supply node (34), a regulated voltage supply (36) 
coupled to the supply node (34) and supplying power to 

a microprocessor controller (38), a controllable 
current source (40) coupled to and receiving power 

from the supply node (34) and coupled to the 
microprocessor controller (38) through one or more 

control lines (39), and a deployment squib (42) in 
series with the controllable current source (40). The 

microprocessor (38) controls the controllable current 
source (40) to provide electric current from the 

supply node (34) to the squib (42) to deploy the 
supplemental inflatable restraint system, wherein the 

single reserve capacitor (26) supplies reserve energy 
to the regulated voltage supply (36), the controllable 

current source (40), the microprocessor controller 
(38) and the squib (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a supplemental 
inflatable restraint system and to a method of 
deploying a supplemental inflatable restraint. The subject of this invention is related to 
our co-pending European patent application 93202723.8. In some existing supplemental inflatable 
restraint systems, one or more electromechanical 
sensors sense sudden deceleration of a vehicle and 
close electrical contacts to initiate desired 
deployment of a supplemental inflatable restraint. 
When the contacts close, current flows through the 
contacts and through the supplemental inflatable 
restraint deployment squib. To ensure rapid 
deployment of the restraint, a high level of current 
flows through the sensors and squib. The high level 
of current often causes arcing of the sensor, which 
may damage the electromechanical sensor and make it 
unsuitable for re-use. In the case of disconnection of the battery 
during an event for which deployment of the 
supplemental inflatable restraint system is desired, 
reserve capacitors are used as temporary energy 
storage devices to supply the energy necessary to 
deploy the supplemental inflatable restraint. 
Typically, several large reserve capacitors are 
provided. For example, a supplemental inflatable 
restraint system may have one reserve capacitor for 
the control unit and one for each squib to be 
activated. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved supplemental inflatable restraint system and 
method of deploying such a system. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a supplemental inflatable 
restraint system as specified in claim 1.  According to another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a method of deploying a 
supplemental inflatable restraint system as specified 
in claim 2. It is possible in some embodiments to 
provide a supplemental inflatable restraint system 
with a reusable electromechanical actuator. It is 
also possible to provide a supplemental inflatable 
restraint system with improved energy management 
enabling both a reduction in the number of capacitors 
necessary and a reduction in the size of the 
capacitors required by the system without a reduction 
in system performance. In preferred embodiments, it is possible to 
control the supplemental inflatable restraint system 
without causing arcing of the electromechanical 
sensor. Preferably, the apparatus controls current 
flow through a deployment squib by use of a switchable 
current source controlled by a control line, removing 
the final
