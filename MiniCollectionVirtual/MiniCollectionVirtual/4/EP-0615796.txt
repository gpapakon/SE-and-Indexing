<ABSTRACT>
A core body (60) is disposed in a feed passage (40) 
in rear of an extrusion die (5), with the passage being 

provided to transport an extrusile material. One or 
more annular passageways (63) are formed between the 

outer periphery of the core body and the inner periphery 
of the feed passage, so that helical edges (50a, 55a) 

protrude into the annular passageways. As the helical 
edges (50a, 55a) are driven to rotate, a strong thrust is 

applied to the extrusile material (M) within the feed 
passage (40) towards the extrusion die (5), so that the 

extrusion pressure is raised to improve the extrudability 
of various raw materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an extruder used to 
produce extrudates from a metal such as aluminum. The prior art extruders for extruding aluminum or 
the like extrusile metal generally comprise an extrusion 
die giving a desired shape to the extrudates and a material 
passage feeding the metal to the die. An extrusion 
pressure is applied to the softened extrusile metal 
that is advancing in the passage towards the die, so that 
the extrudates of the desired shape are produced. The present applicant has proposed, in its Japanese 
Patent Applications JP-A-6182434 and JP-A-6226337, an 
apparatus for continuously extruding a wire-shaped 
or rod-shaped raw material. However, those 
applications have been published after the priority date 
of the present application. As is shown in Fig. 7, this apparatus comprises a 
die 103 and a container 102 disposed in rear of the die 
and having a heater 101. The apparatus further comprises 
a material feeder 104 in rear of the container 102 so 
as to force the raw material into the container. The 
wire-shaped or rod-shaped material 'W' of a small  
 
diameter will be urged into a passage 102a in the container 
102, continuously at room temperature. Thus the 
extrusion pressure in the passage 102a remains at a 
proper level. This pressure will force an extrusile 
material through the die 103 to give an extrudate 'E' of 
a desired profile, wherein the heater 101 previously 
heats and softens the material within the container 102. Operation of such a continuous extruding apparatus 
is however not necessarily perfect in that, depending on 
the profile of extrudates, the feeder 104 possibly fails 
to apply a sufficient pressure to the extrusile material 
'M' in the passage 102a. This problem is not inherent only in the apparatus 
shown in Fig. 7, but may also occur in the prior art 
billet extruders wherein a metal billet in the container 
is forced towards a die. In other words, such a problem 
will occur in common in a variety of the extruders 
that comprise a die and a material feed passage in communication 
therewith. It is another problem in the extruders exemplified 
in Fig. 7 that many factors sometimes cause an uneven 
temperature distribution in the extrusile material within 
the passage. In such an event, the extrusile material 
will soften to a variable degree. If a material not 
heated to completely soften is fed to the die, then an 
undesirably heavy load charged thereto will break it 
early. The apparatus shown in Fig. 7 is designed to continuously
