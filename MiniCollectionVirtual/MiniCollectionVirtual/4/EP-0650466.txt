<ABSTRACT>
Thixotropic Fuller's earth clay minerals which are structurally double silica chains linked together through oxygen to form double-ribbed sheets held by aluminum and/or magnesium in octahedral coordination in an amphibole chain are vacuum dried and admixed with a stabilizing fluid, e.g., silicone fluid, to result in new, low moisture content thixotropic agents. The mineral products thus produced are superior thixotropes when compounded in plastics such as plastisols, adhesive sealants, coatings and other organic binder systems which are heat set or heat cured or moixture cured, and compliance coatings. The methods involve reducing the moisture content of Fuller's earth clay, e.g., attapulgite, by (1) heating it under vacuum at an elevated temperature, preferably between 100  C and 300  C, or (2) heating it at an elevated temperature, preferably between 100  C and 350  C, and adding a stabilizing fluid, or (3) heating it under vacuum at an elevated temperature, preferably below 300  C and adding a stabilizing fluid, to preserve its low moisture properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LOW MOISTURE THIXOTROPIC AGENTS, METHODS AND USESThis application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 489,065 filed March 5, 1990 which is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 321,588 filed March 10, 1989, now Patent No. 4,966,871 issued October 30, 1990.TECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to plastics and coatings comprising thixotropic agents and more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to methods of producing Fuller's earth clays without destroying the thixotropic properties of the clays by reducing the moisture content to a level which permits the clay to be used as a thixotrope in plastics, including plastisols and adhesive sealants, coatings and other organic binder systems which are heat set or heat cured or moisture cured, and compliance coatings.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

BACKGROUND ARTThe production of compounded plastics requires the use of low moisture content thixotropic agents to achieve satisfactory film integrity. For the purposes of the present invention the term "compounded plastic" is used to comprehend within its scope various forms and kinds of plastics which would include but is not limited to plastisols, adhesive sealants, coatings including compliance coatings and moisture cured coatings, and other organic binder systems which are heat set or heat cured or moisture cured.Thixotropic -agents are used in the production of compounded plastics which are applied to metal or other materials, for example, the coatings found on the wire baskets in a dishwasher or refrigerator. The use of the thixotrope permits the uniform application of the plastisol film to the object which is to be coated and the retention of that relatively uniform film during curing. In heat set (i.e., plastics which cannot be reformed) and heat cured (i.e., plastics which may be reformed by reheating) applications, the moisture content of the plastisols must be low enough to prevent the excessive release of moisture upon heating. Ex¬ cessive amounts of moisture released during heating can cause bubbles to form in the plastisol coating, which causes reduced film continuity (a coating which contains voids) , localized areas where the film does not adhere to the surface coated, and a less desirable appearance.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

Also, small quantities of moisture released during curing, although producing no visable blemish, can affect film integrity thereby causing, for example, reduced corrosion protection.Changing requirements for coatings, including moisture cured (i.e., coating
