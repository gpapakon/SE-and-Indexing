<ABSTRACT>
Transporter comprising a first array (6) of jointly movable parallel long supporting elements, and a second array (7) of jointly movable parallel long supporting elements, wherein each array is positioned such that, between the long supporting elements of one array, space is left open to allow passage of one long supporting element from the other array, wherein the arrays each form a support surface for an object and wherein the arrays are primarily arranged as parallel surfaces, and are movable towards and away from each other, such that the supporting surfaces of the arrays can be brought into a common plane and can be brought into positions where the support surfaces of the one array protrude with respect to the other, wherein the arrays are primarily aligned in a fixed position in the longitudinal direction of the supporting elements, and that at least one of the arrays moves backwards and forwards in the longitudinal direction of the long supporting elements, connected with a driving means which provides forward and backward drive motion.

<DESCRIPTION>
TransporterThe invention relates to a transporter comprising a first array of jointly movable parallel long supporting elements, and a second array of jointly movable parallel long supporting elements, wherein each array is positioned such that, between the long supporting elements of one array, space is left open to allow passage of one long supporting element from the other array, wherein the arrays each form a support surface for an object, and wherein the arrays are basically arranged as parallel surfaces, and are movable towards and away from each other, such that the supporting surfaces of the arrays can be brought into a common plane and can be brought into positions where the support surfaces of the one array protrude with respect to the other.Such transporter is known from the French patent specification 2.1143.040. Therein, a lift and transport installation for automobiles is described. This installation comprises two grids of parallel bars. The first grid is fixed, with the upper side of the grid level flush with the upper surface of an elevated platform. This grid extends far enough beyond this platform so that an automobile can be driven entirely onto this first grid from the platform. With this, the bars of this first grid are lined up parallel to the edge of the platform. The second grid, fixed to a wheeled chassis, can be moved up and down. This chassis can be moved under the first grid, with the second grid either above or beneath the first grid. The space between the bars of each grid is sufficient to allow the second grid to be moved unhindered between positions beneath and above the first grid, with the chassis under the first grid. When the second grid is moved above the first grid, an automobile will be lifted from the first grid. In this position of the second grid, the chassis with the automobile can be moved away. The aim of the invention is to provide a transporter for the jointly forward movement of a series of articles with a relatively high weight. For objects susceptible to damage, such as cars, this is especially very desirable, for example in storage and transit, where the automobiles are placed as close as possible to each other and parking damages, for instance, can easily arise.According to the invention, this objective is achieved with a device of the type mentioned in the preamble, wherein the arrays are primarily aligned in a fixed position in the longitudinal direction of the supporting elements, and that at least one of the arrays moves backwards and forwards in

1. Transporter comprising a first array of jointly movable parallel long supporting elements, and a second array of jointly movable parallel long supporting elements, wherein each array is positioned such that, between the long supporting elements of one array, s$ace is left open to allow passage of one long supporting element from the other array, wherein the arrays each form a support surface for an object and wherein the arrays are primarily arranged in parallel surfaces, and are movable towards and away from each other, such that the supporting surfaces of the arrays can be brought into a common plane and can be brought into positions where the support surfaces of the one array protrude with respect to the other, characterized in that the arrays are primarily aligned in a fixed position in the longitudinal direction of the supporting elements, and that at least one of the arrays moves backwards and forwards in the longitudinal direction of the long supporting elements, connected with a driving means which provides forward and backward drive motion.
- 2. Transporter according to claim 1, characterized in that at least one of the arrays comprises a support with surfaces which slide over each other.
3. Transporter according to claim 2, characterized in that the first array comprises a support which has two surfaces which slide over each other, of which at least one slopes in comparison to the supporting elements thereof.
4. Transporter according to claim 3. characterized in that the second array comprises a support with two surfaces which slide over each other, which run primarily parallel to the supporting elements thereof.
5. Transporter according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the second array is connected to a drive element with a relatively small stroke, and the first array is connected to a drive element with a relatively large stroke.
6. Transporter according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the arrays form two parts which between them leave space free which is considerably greater than the space between the long supporting elements of each array, wherein the one part has a considerably greater width than the other part, preferably a width more than twice as great.
7. Transporter according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that two long clamping elements which can be moved 


towards and away from each other, run primarily at equal distances from and parallel to the supporting elements of the first and second array.
8. Transporter according to claim 7, characterized in that one clamping element is fixed and the other clamping element is connected to one or more jacks, the piston rod of which is aligned parallel to the bearing surfaces of the first and second arrays.
9. Vessel provided with one or more transporters according to one of the preceding claims.
