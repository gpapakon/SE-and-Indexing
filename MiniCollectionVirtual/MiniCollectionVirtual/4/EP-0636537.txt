<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a power transmission 
system, specifically for an electrically power assisted 

vehicle such as a bicycle, wherein a motor output shaft is 
connected to a driven component via a planetary type 

transmission. The transmission comprises a planetary roller 
type transmission (25) with a plurality of planetary elements 

(54) frictionally engaged between an end portion of the motor 
output shaft (12a) and a surrounding ring (53) secured to the motor, 

said frictional planetary elements being relatively 
supported by a carrier (56) which is connected to the driven 

component.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power transmission system, specifically for an
electrically power assisted vehicle such as a bicycle, comprising a rotary motor output
shaft of an electrical motor, a planetary type transmission disposed coaxially to said
output shaft drivingly connected thereto and a driven component drivingly connected with
said planetary type transmission.Said power transmission system is known from CH-A-593 822, however, shows the
following problems.Conventionally, when a driven device is attached to a motor
through a transmission, it has been a common practice to
form annular stepped portions on the driven device, the
motor and the transmission and to fit said stepped portions
to each other to obtain axial alignment of the component. A
conventional attachment structure for a motor having a
transmission connected thereto is shown in figure 12.Figure 12 shows a motor 101, a planetary gear type
transmission 102 (hereinafter only called transmission) and
a driven device 103 connected to an axial end portion of the
transmission 102. A projection 105 for fitting into a
fitting recess 104 provided on the transmission 102 is
formed on an axial end portion of the motor 101. The axial
end portion of the transmission 102 is also formed with a
fitting projection 107 for fitting into a fitting recess 106
on the driven device 103. With such a type of motor
attachment structure, output gears 108, 109 intermesh with
mating gears (not shown) in axially aligned state by fitting
the projections 105, 107 and the recesses 104, 103 to each
other. For example, such a connecting structure has been applied to
electrical motor power assisted bicycles which are operated
by a resultant force of a rider's pedal force and the
driving force of the electric motor having a planetary gear
type transmission interposed between the electrical motor
and the driven components of the bicycle such as shown in
European patent applications 0517224, 0569954, 0590674 or
0559231.The afore-indicated attachment structure for connecting an
electrical motor, a planetary gear type transmission and a
driven device to each other is disadvantageous in that in
such cases the fear of a misalignment of the components is
relatively large because there are two spots of fitting,
namely between the motor 101 and the transmission 102 and
between the transmission 102 and the driven component 103.
When such an attachment error in terms of misalignment is
relatively large, noise is likely to be produced
additionally from the meshing areas of
