<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a forklift truck (GH) for lifting and lowering as well as transporting loads, with fork prongs (2) which are attached to a mounting frame (4), with a chassis, which has a set of steerable wheels (5), and with a hyraulically operable lifting device (32) which can be operated by a manual adjusting element (1) which is mounted in a manner which allows it to swivel around a horizontal axis. The forklift truck has a crane attachment (KA) which has a load arm (10) constructed such that it can be displaced longitudinally and two supports (8, 14) which are articulated in a manner which allows them to rotate and of which one support (8) is supported on the mounting frame (4) and the other support (4) on the fork prongs (2) of the forklift truck (GH). By virtue of this design even loading areas which are deep and narrow and are only accessible from the side can be loaded without any problem with the aid of the crane attachment (A), and the forklift truck (GH) can be converted within a short time.
