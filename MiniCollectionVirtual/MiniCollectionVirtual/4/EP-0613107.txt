<ABSTRACT>
Document deposit apparatus comprises a document inlet 
(2) into which documents to be deposited are inserted. 

Processing means (15,18) monitor one or more 
characteristics of the documents. Rollers (15,18,19) 

transport documents from the document inlet (2) through the 
processing means. A temporary store (105) is provided to 

which the documents from the processing means are fed by 
the rollers, the temporary store being accessible to a user 

from outside the apparatus through an access door (106). 
A controller (110) indicates to the user the contents of 

the temporary store and, when the user agrees with the 
contents, passes the documents in the temporary store to a 

deposit region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to document deposit apparatus,
for example for banknotes, cheques or other security
documents.The use of Cash Dispensers to assist Bank Tellers is
well known. They provide Banks with advantages in
Productivity, Accounting accuracy and Security. Further,
when connected "Online" they permit easy interchange of
staff at lunch and other "break" times with minimal cash
balancing activities and consequent cost and delays.
However, since most Tellers take in deposits of cash and
cheques in addition to dispensing, there is currently
unavoidable need to count/balance such deposits at change
over times to protect both Bank and Tellers.The object of this invention is to provide an
automated Deposit facility which may be connected online to
a Bank's host computer and thereby eliminate the need for
regular/intermediate manual cash balancing. Complex
devices are available, from Japan and other sources, which
provide this service. However, they are generally both too
large and too costly for many Banks to justify
commercially.For example, US-A-4889220 describes a document deposit
apparatus in which documents are fed through a
discriminator which determines whether or not the documents
are valid. Valid documents are then fed to a valid
document temporary store and invalid documents to an
invalid document temporary store. The user is then allowed
access to the invalid document temporary store so that he
can withdraw the documents and re-feed them. A similar
approach is described in GB 2073718 in which documents are
discriminated and then fed to either a valid or invalid
temporary store. As explained above, however, these
systems are complex and bulky and not well suited to the
rugged environment of banks and the like where they are
used.In accordance with the present invention, document
deposit apparatus comprises a document inlet into which 
documents to be deposited are inserted; processing means
for monitoring at least for the presence of a document;
transport means for transporting documents from the
document inlet through the processing means; a temporary
store to which the documents from the processing means are
fed by the transport means; and control means for
indicating to the user the contents of the temporary store
and, when the user agrees with the contents, for passing
the documents in the temporary store to a deposit region
and is characterised in that the transport means feeds all
documents passing through the processing means to the same
temporary store and that the temporary store

<CLAIMS>
Document deposit apparatus comprising a document inlet
(2) into which documents to be deposited are inserted;

processing means (15,18) for monitoring at least for the
presence of a document; transport means (15,18,19) for

transporting documents from the document inlet (2) through
the processing means; a temporary store (105) to which the

documents from the processing means are fed by the
transport means; and control means (110) for indicating to

the user the contents of the temporary store and, when the
user agrees with the contents, for passing the documents in

the temporary store to a deposit region, characterised in
that the transport means (15,18,19) feeds all documents

passing through the processing means to the same temporary
store (105) and that the temporary store is accessible to

a user from outside the apparatus through an access door
(106).
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the access
door (106) is normally closed, the apparatus further

comprising a lock operable by the control means (110) to
lock the door in its closed position at least after a user

has agreed the contents of the temporary store.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein at
least part of the access door (106) is transparent to

enable the contents of the temporary store (105) to be
viewed.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the temporary store (105) is positioned above the

deposit region.
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the floor
(109) of the temporary store (105) is movable from

underneath documents in the temporary store to allow the
documents to drop under gravity into the deposit region.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims,
further comprising a second deposit region (136), the

control means being operable to move documents in the 
temporary store to either the first or the second deposit

region.
Apparatus according to claim 6, further comprising a
slidable frame (137) for sliding documents in the temporary

store (105) across its floor (109) to the second deposit
region (136).
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims,
further comprising a document detector for detecting the

presence of documents in the temporary store (105).
A method of operating document deposit apparatus
according to any of the preceding claims, the method

comprising supplying at least one document to the document
inlet, the or each document then being transported to the

temporary store, the step of agreeing the contents of the
temporary store including the step of the operator

supplying to the control means a value constituting an
operator determined value for the document(s).
