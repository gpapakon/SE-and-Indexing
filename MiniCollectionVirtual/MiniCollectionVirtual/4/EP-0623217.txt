<ABSTRACT>
A sensor (10) is disclosed for measuring the acceleration and angular rotation rate of a moving body and is micromachined from a silicon substrate (16). First and second accelerometers (32a and b) are micromachined from the silicon substrate (16), each having a force sensing axis (38) and producing an output signal of the acceleration of the moving body along its force sensing axis (38). The first and second accelerometers (32a and b) are mounted within the substrate (16) to be moved along a vibration axis (41). The first and second accelerometers (32a and b) are vibrated or dithered to increase the Coriolis component of the output signals from the first and second accelerometers (32a and b). A sinusoidal drive signal of a predetermined frequency is applied to a conductive path (92) disposed on each of the accelerometers. A link (72) is formed within the silicon substrate (16) and connected to each of the accelerometers (32a and b), whereby motion imparted to one results in a like, but opposite motion applied to the other accelerometer (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for determining the
acceleration and rate of angular rotation of a moving body
and, in particular, one which is adapted to be formed,
e.g. through micromachining, from a silicon substrate.The U.S. patent application from which this application
claims priority is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent
application 07/653,533, filed February 8, 1991 and
corresponding to international application WO 92/14160.Reference is further made to the following commonly
assigned patents:
1) WO-A-9101009, entitled "Monolithic Accelerometer",
with priority of July 6, 1989 in the name of Brian L. Norling;2) US-A-5005413, entitled "Accelerometer with Co-Planar
Push-Pull Force Transducers", filed February 27, 1989 in
the name of Mitch Novack;3) US-A-5168756, entitled "Coriolis Inertial Rate and
Acceleration Sensor", filed in the name of Rand H. Hulsing
II;4) US-A-5111694, entitled "Torque Coil Stress Isolator",
filed in the name of S. Foote.The rate of rotation of a moving body about an axis may be
determined by mounting an accelerometer on a frame and
dithering it, with the accelerometer's sensitive axis and 
the direction of motion of the frame both normal to the
rate axis about which rotation is to be measured. For
example, consider a set of orthogonal axes X, Y and Z
oriented with respect to the moving body. Periodic
movement of the accelerometer along the Y axis of the
moving body with its sensitive axis aligned with the Z
axis results in the accelerometer experiencing a Coriolis
acceleration directed along the Z axis as the moving body
rotates about the X axis. A Coriolis acceleration is that
perpendicular acceleration developed while the body is
moving in a straight line, due to rotation of the frame on
which it is mounted. The Coriolis acceleration acting on
the accelerometer is proportional to the velocity of the
moving sensor body along the Y axis and its angular rate
of rotation about the X axis. An output signal from the
accelerometer thus includes a DC or slowly changing
component or force signal F representing the linear
acceleration of the body along the Z axis, and a periodic
component or rotational signal Ω representing the
Coriolis acceleration resulting from rotation of the body
about the X axis.The Coriolis component can be produced by vibrating the
accelerometer and causing it to dither back and forth
along a line perpendicular to the input axis of the
accelerometer. If the frame on which the accelerometer is
mounted is rotating, the Coriolis acceleration
