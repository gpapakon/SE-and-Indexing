<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for consolidating bulky fibrous structures, such as pneumatically produced nonwovens or layers of vertically layered card web, pricked textile, hackle textile, hair-yarn textile, etc., the method being based on the stepwise spinning of the fibre ends, drawn out of the surface of the fibrous structure, in the form of the yarn by means of rows of rotating elements which are lowered between the take-up elements from one or both sides into the consolidated bulky structure.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the consolidation of bulky fibrous 
webs, characterised in that the fibre ends drawn out of 

one and/or the other surface of the fibrous web are 
twisted in steps into a yarn-shaped texture. 
A consolidation process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the fibre ends drawn out of one 

and/or the other surface of the fibrous web are twisted 
together with another longitudinal fibrous web. 
A consolidation process according to Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that a network web or a chain of thread 

is applied to one and/or the other surface of the 
fibrous web, whereafter the fibre ends drawn out of one 

and/or the other surface of the fibrous web are twisted 
in steps. 
A consolidation process according to Claims 1, 2 or 
3, characterised in that with fibrous webs supplied in 

parallel, the fibre ends drawn out of both surfaces of 
the fibrous webs supplied in parallel are twisted into a 

common texture (binding). 
An installation for the performance of the process 
according to at least one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that it is formed by twisting elements 
(2) attached in rows in the frame (5) and disposed 

between fixed receiving elements (1); the receiving 
elements and also feeding disks (3) and removal disks 

(4) are disposed at an adjustable height above the 
fibrous web (7) for the adjustment of the - angle in a 

range of 45°-135° between the axis of the twisting 
element (2) and the plane formed by the receiving elements 

(1), and at the same time serve for the adjustment 
of the depth H to which the twisting elements (2) dip 

into the layer of the fibrous web (7) in a range of 0-7mm 
between the plane of the receiving elements (1) and 

the end of the twisting element (2).  
 
An installation according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that the receiving elements (1), the feeding disks 

(3) and the removal disks (4) are replaced by belt 
conveyers (19) for advancing the fibrous web (7). 
An installation according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that the receiving elements (1), the feeding disks 

(3), the removal disks (4) and the frames with twisting 
elements (2) are disposed laterally inverted opposite 

one another at a distance which corresponds to the 
thickness of the fibrous web (7). 
An installation according to Claim 5 and/or 7, 
characterised in that the frames (5) with twisting 

elements (2) are disposed one after the other at a 
distance of 50-500mm. 
An installation according to Claims 5, 7 or 8, 
characterised in that the receiving elements (1) are 

adapted to the formation of tensioned threads (14) which 
move at the speed of advance of the fibrous web (7). 
An installation according to Claims 5, 7, 8 or 9, 
characterised in that the twisting elements (2) have 

resilient tips (21) which consist of a body (2), a tip 
(21) and bristles (23) aligned in the form of a paint 

brush having a crown angle = 120-180° and a diameter of 
5-20mm. 
An installation according to Claim 10, characterised 
in that the twisting elements (2) with resilient 

tips (21) are hollow. 
An installation according to one of Claims 5 to 11, 
characterised in that the twisting elements (2) have a 

common belt drive (10) with a single driving unit (11).
