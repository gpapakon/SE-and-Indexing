<ABSTRACT>
In the process for preparing dicalcium phosphate dihydrate having a good fluoride compatibility and stability to hydrolysis, which when used in toothpaste effects an as small as possible further thickening, by reaction of calcium carbonate suspended in water with an aqueous solution of orthophosphoric acid, precipitation onto this of dimagnesium phosphate trihydrate as stabiliser by reacting aqueous solutions of a magnesium salt and of orthophosphoric acid in the presence of a basic compound and also subsequent addition of tetrasodium pyrophosphate as further stabiliser to the reaction mixture and subsequent filtration, drying and milling of the precipitate, from 0.2 to 0.6 % by weight of tetrasodium pyrophosphate, calculated on the basis of the dicalcium phosphate dihydrate precipitated in the reaction mixture, is added to the aqueous reaction mixture.

A process for the preparation of dicalcium phosphate 
dihydrate, which has a good compatibility with 

fluorine and stability to hydrolysis and causes the 
minimum possible after-thickening when used in 

toothpastes, by reaction of calcium carbonate 
suspended in water with an aqueous solution of 

orthophosphoric acid, precipitation of dimagnesium 
phosphate trihydrate, as a stabilizer, by reaction 

of aqueous solutions of a magnesium salt and of 
orthophosphoric acid in the presence of a basic 

compound and subsequent addition of tetrasodium 
pyrophosphate to the reaction mixture as a further 

stabilizer, and final filtering, drying and grinding 
of the precipitate, which comprises adding to the 

aqueous reaction mixture 0.2 to 0.6 % by weight of 
tetrasodium pyrophosphate calculated with respect to 

the dicalcium phosphate dihydrate precipitated in 
the reaction mixture. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
tetrasodium pyrophosphate is added as powder or 

preferably in aqueous solution. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
approximately stoichiometric amounts of the calcium 

carbonate suspension and the orthophosphoric acid 
solution are introduced into a reaction vessel, the 

reaction is kept at temperatures which do not exceed 
50Â°C in a pH range from 2.2 to 2.6 and the reaction  

 
mixture is allowed to reach a pH of 3.2 to 3.4 by 

addition of the remaining calcium carbonate 
suspension only towards the end of the reaction; 

wherein the mixture is subsequently stirred for 10 
to 20 minutes, the pH of the reaction mixture is 

increased to 5.6 to 5.8 with sodium hydroxide 
solution and dimagnesium phosphate trihydrate is 

precipitated in an amount of 2 to 4 % by weight, 
calculated with respect to the dicalcium phosphate 

dihydrate precipitated in the reaction mixture, at 
a pH of 5.6 to 6.0 while simultaneously introducing 

stoichiometric amounts of aqueous solutions of 
magnesium salt, orthophosphoric acid and sodium 

hydroxide solution, the pH is brought to the neutral 
point with sodium hydroxide solution and the 

reaction mixture is subsequently stirred for 2 to 
3 minutes; wherein 0.2 to 0.6 % by weight of tetrasodium 

pyrophosphate, calculated with respect to the 
dicalcium phosphate dihydrate precipitated in the 

reaction mixture, is added to the aqueous reaction 
mixture and the mixture is subsequently stirred for 

a short time; and wherein the precipitated product 
is separated off from the reaction mixture, dried 

and comminuted to the particle size customary for 
use in toothpastes. 
The process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein 0.4 % by weight of tetrasodium 

pyrophosphate is added. 
The process as claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein the 
reaction vessel is provided with a double jacket for 

the purpose of cooling.
