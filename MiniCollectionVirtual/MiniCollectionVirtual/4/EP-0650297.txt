<ABSTRACT>
This image transmission system, using a transmission channel with a relatively narrow passband, includes, on the one hand, a sender device (1) provided with a view taking unit (2) which is arranged to supply N image information items completed by a timing unit, with a first acquisition member (5) for acquiring transmission information from the complete image information with a view to transmitting it via the said transmission channel and, on the other hand, at least one receiving device (10) provided with a reconstruction unit (14) for supplying reconstructed image information from the transmission information. The acquisition unit (5) is designed to acquire one image among N images supplied by the image taking unit (2) while the reconstruction unit (14) is based on a time-based interpolation unit for interpolating the N-1 images which were not transmitted from the images which were transmitted. Application: high-definition television.

<CLAIMS>
A system for transmitting pictures using a transmission channel having a
relatively narrow passband, said system comprising:

a transmitter (1) provided with:

a pick-up member (2) for supplying complete picture information in units of
time,
a motion estimation member (22) for supplying motion indications to be
transmitted for blocks of pixels,
a sampling member (5) for supplying pictures to be transmitted by sampling one
picture among N complete pictures, N being higher than 2, and leaving N-1

intermediate pictures to be restored,
a transmission member (8) for transmitting the pictures to be transmitted and
the motion indications to be transmitted,

at least one receiver (10) provided with:

a receiver member for supplying transmitted pictures and transmitted motion
indications on the basis of pictures to be transmitted and motion indications to be

transmitted,
an interpolation member (33) for restoring the N-1 intermediate pictures on the
basis of transmitted pictures while taking transmitted motion indications into account,

the motion estimation member comprising:
assignment means for assigning, to each block of an intermediate picture
situated between two transmitted pictures TT and TT+1 referred to as framing pictures,

a double motion indication VB and VF based, respectively, on each of these framing
pictures, characterized in that the double motion indication is assigned to each block for

transmission,

and in that the interpolation member is provided with computing means for computing
the luminance I(x,α) of pixels x associated with the intermediate pictures α by

weighting of the blocks associated with the framing pictures defined, respectively, by
the two motion indications.
A system for transmitting pictures as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the computing means compute:


I(x,α) = (1-α).I(x + VB,TT) + α.I(x + VF,TT+1)
 
wherein α (0 ≤ α ≤ 1) defines the placement of the intermediate picture between TT

and TT+1 which are the framing pictures and x defines the pixels of the intermediate
picture.
A receiver conforming to a transmission system as claimed in claim 1 or
2, comprising:


a receiver member for supplying transmitted pictures and transmitted motion
indications on the basis of pictures to be transmitted and motion indications to

be transmitted,
an interpolation member (33) for restoring the N-1 intermediate pictures on the
basis of transmitted pictures while taking transmitted motion indications into

account,

characterized in that

the motion estimation member comprises:

assignment means for assigning, to each block of an intermediate picture
situated between two transmitted pictures TT and TT+1 referred to as framing

pictures, a double motion indication VB and VF based, respectively, on each of
these framing pictures,

and in that the interpolation member is provided with computing means for computing
the luminance I(x,α) of pixels x associated with the intermediate pictures α by

weighting of the blocks associated with the framing pictures defined, respectively, by
the two motion indications.

means compute:


I(x,α) = (1-α).I(x + VB,TT) + α.I(x + VF,TT+1)

wherein α (0 ≤ α ≤ 1) defines the placement of the intermediate picture between TT
and TT +1 which are the framing pictures and x defines the pixels of the intermediate

picture.
A method of transmitting pictures, comprising the following steps:
for forming information components of pictures to be transmitted constituted by pictures

to be transmitted and motion indications established from complete pictures:

a motion estimation step for supplying motion indications on complete blocks of
pixels,
a sampling step for supplying pictures to be transmitted by sampling one picture 
among N complete pictures, N being higher than 2, and leaving N-1 intermediate

pictures to be restored,

and, for restoring the pictures,

a receiving step for supplying transmitted pictures and transmitted motion
indications on the basis of pictures to be transmitted and motion indications to be

transmitted,
an interpolation step for restoring the N-1 intermediate pictures on the basis of
transmitted pictures while taking transmitted motion indications into account,

assigning, to each block of an intermediate picture situated between two
transmitted pictures TT and TT+1 referred to as framing pictures, a double motion

indication VB and VF based, respectively, on each of these framing pictures,
characterized in that the double motion indication is assigned to each block for

transmission,

and in that the interpolation comprises at least a step of computing the luminance I(x,α)
