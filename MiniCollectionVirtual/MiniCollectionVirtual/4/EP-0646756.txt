<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for preparing pure, gaseous CO₂ 
from a gaseous CO₂-containing product (2) having a lower 

degree of purity 
than the final product, by compressing (4) and cooling (5) the 

gaseous basic 
material, whereupon the gaseous impurities are discharged and the 

purified liquid CO₂ (27) is used as a cooling medium for 
cooling the gas 

mixture which is used as the basic material, whereby the gas mixture is 
compressed (8) to a pressure of 40 - 65 bar before the cooling step 

(12) is 
carried out. The invention furthermore relates to an apparatus for 

carrying out this method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for preparing pure, gaseous CO2
from a gaseous CO2-containing basic material having a lower degree of purity
than the final product, by compressing and cooling the gaseous basic
material, liquefying it by using purified liquid CO2 as a cooling medium whereupon the gaseous impurities are discharged
from the liquefied gaseous basic material
and the vaporised purified liquid CO2 is supplied to a consumer. The invention furthermore
relates to an apparatus for carrying out said method; said apparatus consisting of at least two compressors, two coolers
and purification equipment which are interconnected via piping
suitable for that purpose.A method and an apparatus of this type are known from European
Patent Application No. 194,795. The method as it is known from the
aforesaid European Patent Application shows the preparation of liquid
carbon dioxide, whereby the pure liquid carbon dioxide formed in the
course of the implementation of the method is used as the cooling medium
for the preparation of gaseous carbon dioxide. The use of liquid carbon
dioxide as a cooling medium is for example important in a beer brewing
plant, because if other, usual cooling agents are used, such as ammonia
or chlorofluorocarbons, there is a danger that the desired pure carbon
dioxide as the final product is contaminated with cooling agent. Although
liquid carbon dioxide formed in the course of the preparation is used as
the cooling agent in the aforesaid European Patent Application, another
cooling agent is furthermore used in cooling unit 20, as shown in Figure
1 of the aforesaid European Patent Application. Furthermore it has
appeared to be possible to enhance the efficiency of the preparation
process of purified, gaseous carbon dioxide in comparison with the 
efficiency that can be achieved in practice by using the aforesaid known
method.The method according to the invention is characterized in that
the compression of the gaseous basic material is performed in at least
two stages to a final pressure of 40 - 65 bar, said purified liquid CO2
is expanded to the suction pressure of the compressor of the last stage,
whereupon the gaseous CO2 thus obtained is fed back as flash gas to the
supply pipe of the compressor of the last stage, said liquid purified CO2
fraction is used to liquefy said gaseous basic
material.
Furthermore it is to be preferred to use
cooling water, ice water or another cooling agent, such as alcohol or
propene glycol, to the exclusion of chlorofluorocarbons or ammonia,
besides
