<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diagnostic technique useful 
for detecting, diagnosing or monitoring neurological and/or muscular 
diseases, disorders or injuries. The invention provides for an assay 
system useful for detecting denervated or degenerating muscle by 
measuring the amount of soluble ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor 
(CNTFRα) in body fluids. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a protein that is required 
for the survival of embryonic chick ciliary ganglion neurons in vitro 
(Manthorpe et al.,1980, J. Neurochem. 34:69-75). The ciliary 
ganglion is anatomically located within the orbital cavity, lying 
between the lateral rectus and the sheath of the optic nerve; it 
receives parasympathetic nerve fibers from the oculomotor nerve 
which innervates the ciliary muscle and sphincter pupillae. Over the past decade, a number of biological effects have been 
ascribed to CNTF in addition to its ability to support the survival of 
ciliary ganglion neurons. CNTF is believed to induce the 
differentiation of bipotential glial progenitor cells in the perinatal 
rat optic nerve and brain (Hughes et al., 1988, Nature 335:70-73). 
Furthermore, it has been observed to promote the survival of 
embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons (Skaper and 
Varon, 1986, Brain Res. 389:39-46). In addition, CNTF supports the 
survival and differentiation of motor neurons and hippocampal 
neurons. (International Publication No WO 91/04316)  
 Recently, CNTF has been cloned and synthesized in bacterial 
expression systems, as described in WO 91/04316 
entitled "Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor". In addition to CNTF, the receptor for CNTF (originally termed 
"CNTFR") has been cloned, sequenced and expressed (see WO 91/19009 
entitled "The Ciliary Neurotrophic 
Factor Receptor"). Unlike other known growth factor receptors which have an 
extracellular domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a 
cytoplasmic domain, the CNTF receptor does not appear to have a 
cytoplasmic domain. Furthermore, it is linked to the cell surface via 
a covalent linkage from the protein to an oligosaccharide which is in 
turn glycosidically linked to phosphatidylinositol (referred to as a 
"GPI-linkage"). GPI-linkages play a role in the attachment of 
proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase (APase) to membranes. The 
role of GPI linkages in the function of biological membrane 
components have been elucidated as a major means of anchoring 
proteins to biological membranes in the case of at least 30 distinct 
proteins. [(Slein,

A method of detecting muscle denervation or degeneration in a patient afflicted 
with such denervation or degeneration comprising; 


a) obtaining from said patient a sample of a body fluid; 
b) reacting said sample with a material which specifically binds to ciliary 
neurotrophic factor receptor alpha protein (CNTFRα) which is present in 

solution in said sample to provide a complex of CNTFRα and said 
material: 
c) determining a level of CNTFRα in said sample based on a measurement 
of CNTFRα in said complex; 
d) comparing the level of CNTFRα determined in said sample to levels of 
soluble CNTFRα determined in samples of the body fluid of unafflicted 

individuals, wherein an elevated level of CNTFRα in the sample is 
indicative of muscle denervation or degeneration in the patient. 
A method for measuring the effectiveness of a treatment on the course of a 
disease associated with muscle denervation or degeneration in an afflicted patient 

comprising: 

a) obtaining from said patient at a particular timepoint a first sample of a 
body fluid; 
b) reacting said first sample with a material which specifically binds to 
ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha protein (CNTFRα) which is 

present in solution in said first sample to provide a complex of CNTFRα 
and said material;  

 
c) determining a level of CNTFRα in said first sample based on a 
measurement of CNTFRα in said complex; 
d) comparing the level of CNTFRα determined in said first sample to levels 
of soluble CNTFRα determined in a second sample of body fluid, said 

second sample being taken from an afflicted patient not receiving the 
treatment, the second sample being taken at the same timepoint as the 

timepoint at which the sample is taken from the patient receiving 
treatment. 
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein said body fluid is urine. 
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein said body fluid is blood, plasma or cerebral 
spinal fluid. 
The method of any one of the preceding claims wherein said muscle degeneration 
is associated with a degenerative muscle disease. 
The method of claim 5 wherein said degenerative muscle disease is muscular 
dystrophy, fascio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy, limb girdle dystrophy, distal muscular 

dystrophy, or myositis. 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein said muscle degeneration is 
caused by denervation of the muscle. 
The method of claim 7 wherein said denervation is caused by nerve injury.  
 
The method of claim 8 wherein said nerve injury is associated with carpal tunnel 
syndrome, compression, mechanical severance of a nerve or a tumor. 
The method of claim 7 wherein said denervation is caused by a neurological 
disease or disorder. 
The method of claim 10 wherein said denervation is caused by a degenerative 
neurological disease or disorder. 
The method claim 11 wherein said degenerative disease or disorder is a 
degenerative disease of motor neurons. 
The method of claim 12 wherein said degenerative disease or disorder is 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. spinal muscular atrophy, post-polio syndrome, infantile 

muscular atrophy, poliomyelitis or Chaclot-Marie Tooth disease. 
The method of claim 10 wherein said denervation is caused by an inflammatory 
or demyelinating neurological disease or disorder. 
The method of claim 14 wherein said disease or disorder is Guillan-Barré 
Syndrome or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. 
The method claim 14 wherein said disease or disorder is a peripheral neuropathy.  
 
The method of claim 16 wherein said disease or disorder is associated with 
diabetic neuropathy, acute neurapraxia, neurotmesis, or axonotmesis. 
The method of any one of the preceding claims wherein the level of CNTFRα in 
the sample is determined by immunoblotting with anti-CNTFRα antibody.
