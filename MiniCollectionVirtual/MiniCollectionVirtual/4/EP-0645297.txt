<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a known type of dolly with a 
metallic structure, that is improved to increase 

its performance. Such dolly is composed of two 
frames (6, 8), shaped as a reverse U, mutually 

crossed as an X with a loading platform (14, 16) in 
the lower area. The frame ends are equipped with 

wheels (18). The two frames (6, 8) are mutually 
hinged next to their crossing (2, 4) and the 

platform (14, 16) below is of the articulated type, 
so that the dolly can be reduced almost to a parcel 

from the extended position. The novelty is provided 
by modifying and integrating one of the frames (8) 

with members (28, 36) that are integral and 
coplanar with it, so that it can be able to support 

pieces of equipment (32, 38, 40, 42), not only 
suspended ones any more, but also overhanging ones, 

and this without having to use hinging axes that 
are common to the two frames (6, 8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention deals with a foldable 
articulated dolly, suitable for the transport and 
loading of room cleaning and washing equipment. For years, cleaning equipment manufacturers 
have been marketing dollies with a metallic 
structure, whose type can be reduced to a parcel 
when not being used, composed of two frames, shaped 
as a reverse U, mutually crossed as an X, with a 
loading platform in the lower area. The frame ends 
are equipped with wheels. The two reverse-U frames 
are mutually hinged next to their crossing and the 
platform below is of the articulated type, 
according to known solutions, not only in this 
field of dollies, but also in other sectors. In 
fact, the platform is composed of two parts that 
are mutually hinged in an intermediate section and 
that are also hinged at their ends, next to their 
connection to the reverse U-frames. The two parts of the platform, when the dolly 
is open, are coplanar and, when loaded, this  
 
coplanarity is ensured by two extensions belonging 
to one of them, that, after having passed the 
intermediate hinging axis, rest on the other part. By lifting the platform next to the 
intermediate hinging, its two component parts are 
closed like a book, forcing the two supporting 
frames to close one against the other. Vice versa, 
when the two frames are one next to the other, by 
extending them to arrange them as an open X, the 
platform is restored, since its two component parts 
are opened again, reaching coplanarity. Such a 
dolly is used to transport rubbish bags, to 
transport linen-carrying bags, etc. The mouth edges 
of the bag containers are hanged to the upper cross 
members of the reverse U-frames, while the bag 
bottoms are supported by the platform below. The upper cross members of the reverse U-frames 
are also useful as handrail to manoeuvre the 
dolly when moving it. So far, what has been 
described relates to long-existing dollies in all 
markets that are produced practically by all 
cleaning equipment manufacturers.  
 US-A-3.286.752 represents the most relevant prior 
art and discloses a dolly like the one included in 
the preamble of Claim 1. The dolly described in 
this document is not suitable to support 
overhanging pieces of equipment and cannot be used 
to transport and load room cleaning equipment.  
 The novelty of the present invention is 
provided by modifying the upper section of one of 
the two reverse U-frames, placing it in a vertical  
 
lying and integrating such section with members 
that are integral and

<CLAIMS>
Foldable articulated dolly, suitable to 
transport and load room cleaning equipment, 

comprising: 

two reverse U-frames (6, 8) mutually hinged 
next to hinges (2, 4) located at an intermediate 

crossing along legs of said frames (6, 8)
characterized in that
 it further comprises 
a platform composed of two parts (14, 16) 
mutually hinged in an intermediate position (1⊘), 

each one of said two parts (14, 16) being in turn 
hinged next to end areas of the legs of said 

reverse-U frames (6, 8),
one (8) of the two reverse U-frames (6, 8) 
crossed as an X and mutually hinged next to their 

crossing (2, 4) having a section (3⊘) of its upper 
part (22) that is lying on a vertical plane when the dolly is in its 

open position. 
Foldable articulated dolly according to claim 
1, characterized in that the section (3⊘) lying on 

a vertical plane belonging to the upper part of one 
(8) of the two reverse U-frames (6, 8) of the dolly 

is internally integrated with additional members 
(28, 36) that are integral and coplanar with it so 

that they make it suitable to support overhanging  
 

equipment (32), including wringers (4⊘), and 
arranged so that said additional members (28, 36) 

cannot affect the other frame (6) in any way. 
Foldable articulated dolly according to claim 
1, characterized in that the vertical plane in 

which the section (3⊘) of the upper part (22) of 
the reverse U-frame (8) lies, with respect to the 

underlying loading platform (14, 16) of the dolly 
or with respect to a support plan composed of 

wheels (18) applied to lower ends of the two frames 
(6, 8), can pass through a center line of the 

loading platform (14, 16) or be displaced from said 
center line. 
Foldable articulated dolly according to any 
one of the previous claims, characterized in that 

an alignment axis of said hinges (2, 4) of the two 
reverse U-frames (6, 8) is in the vertical plane in 

which the section (3⊘) of the upper part (22) of 
the reverse U-frame (8) lies.
