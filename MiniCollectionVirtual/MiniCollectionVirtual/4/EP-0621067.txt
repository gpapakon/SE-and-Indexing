<ABSTRACT>
A water filtration device which includes a housing 
and a filtration assembly located within the housing, 

wherein the filtration assembly has a water inlet, and 
includes a cylindrical support adapted for mounting in the 

housing and having formed therein a plurality of outlet 
apertures; a generally cylindrical filter mesh disposed 

within the support; and a water circulating plate disposed 
in the inlet of the filtration assembly, characterized in 

that the support has a spiral groove on an inner surface 
thereof, the spiral groove being arranged to permit exit 

of filtered water through the mesh, along the groove, and 
out through any of the outlet apertures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to filtering devices 
in general and, in particular, to screen filters for 
water. A variety of water filtering devices are known in 
the art for achieving various degrees of filtration of 
different grades of water. Such filters generally include 
a cylindrical filter body inside of which a filter mesh is 
mounted in a cylindrical filter support. These filters are 
adapted to permit flow of water from the inside of the 
screen mesh to the outside, or vice versa, then out 
through the outlet. One type of filter in use today is the circulating 
water filter which includes a circulating disk or plate at 
the water inlet defining a number of angled bores through 
which the water flows. The water flows from inside the 
filter mesh to the outside. The angled bores in the 
circulating plate cause the incoming water to enter at an 
angle relative to the mesh, thereby helping to dislodge 
particulate matter which has stuck to the mesh. This 
self-cleaning action is a great advantage over other 
filters. In order to prevent the mesh from "sticking" to 
the filter support between the perforations, a nylon 
screen can be inserted between the mesh and the filter 
support, as a partial solution. A disadvantage of known filtration devices is that 
blockage of screen mesh adjacent a hole in the perforated 
support is equivalent to the blockage of the hole. Thus,  
 
over the lifetime of the filtering device, water to be 
filtered has to pass through an area of mesh that 
decreases as the holes become blocked, thereby permitting 
a decreasing volumetric throughflow of filtered water, 
until the mesh becomes completely blocked. In addition, conventional filter devices include a 
residue collection unit which is mounted on the end of the 
filter body by means of a heavy, separate cover. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
an improved self-cleaning water filtration device which 
overcomes disadvantages of the prior art. There is thus provided in accordance with an 
embodiment of the invention, a water filtration device 
which includes a housing and a filtration assembly located 
within the housing, wherein the filtration assembly has a 
water inlet, and includes
