<ABSTRACT>
A temperature limiter contains a resetting knob (18), which is designed as a plunger with two steps, whose two steps (19, 20) are designed such that the first step (19) acts on the spring terminal (2) when the resetting knob (18) is operated, and such that the second step (20) acts on the switching rocker (12a, b, d) in such a manner that the electrical contact between the spring terminal contact piece (9) and the rocker contact piece (13) is interrupted as long as the resetting knob (18) is depressed. The fracture safety function of the spring terminal (2) is extended by the function of operating safety.

A temperature limiter having a drive element (1) for a sensor 
element (15), a reset button (18) and an electrical switching contact 

formed from a spring terminal contact portion (9) on the bar (6) of a 
spring terminal (2) and a rocker contact portion (13) on the switching 

rocker (12) of a bistable tilt system (3) having an ON and an OFF-position, 
wherein after a limit temperature at the sensor element (15) is 

exceeded the tilt system (3) is in the OFF position and the switching 
contact (9, 13) is opened, characterised in that a base plate (4) is 

provided as a fixing element for the tilt system (3) and for the spring 
terminal (2), that arranged on the base plate (4) is a stop element (17) 

with a support surface (16) for the free end of the bar (6), which 
establishes the normal position of the bar (6) and the spring terminal 

contact portion (9) when lifted away from the base plate (4) by means of 
the drive element (1), that the movement of the switching rocker (12) is 

limited in a direction towards the base plate (4) by a means (9 and 17 
respectively) in the ON-position, and that the reset button (18) has a 

rest position and two actuating elements (19; 20) for displacement of the 
bar (6) and for actuation of the switching rocker (12) wherein upon 

actuation of the reset button (18) to prevent contact between the two 
contact portions (9; 13) the first actuating element (19) pushes the free 

end of the bar (6) away from the support surface (16) before the switching 
rocker (12) tilts from the OFF-position into the ON-position by means of 

the second actuating element (20). 
A temperature limiter according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the reset button (18) is in the form of a thrust member which as the 

actuating elements has two steps (19; 20) which are displaced by a 
predetermined spacing (a). 
A temperature limiter according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the movement of the switching rocker (12) is limited 

by the rocker contact portion (13) or the stop element (17) in the ON-position 
in a direction towards the base plate (4).  

 
A temperature limiter according to one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the stop element (17) is an integral part of the 

base plate (4). 
A temperature limiter according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that in the OFF-position the movement of the switching 

rocker (12) is limited in a direction away from the base plate (4) by an 
OFF-contact portion (22). 
A temperature limiter according to claim 5 characterised in that 
in the OFF-position the rocker contact portion (13) of the switching 

rocker (12) and the OFF-contact portion (22) form an electrical contact. 
A temperature limiter according to one of claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that the electrical contact between the spring terminal 

contact portion (9) and the rocker contact portion (13) is separated as 
soon as, as a result of failure of the temperature sensor (15), the drive 

element (1) applies no force to the bar (6) and the spring terminal (2) is 
relieved of stress.
