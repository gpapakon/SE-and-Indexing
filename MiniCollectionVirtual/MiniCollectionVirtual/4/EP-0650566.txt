<ABSTRACT>
The bridging coupling is actuated by an annular piston to which the converter internal pressure is applied on one side and a closing pressure in the closing direction. The closing pressure is controlled by a precontrolled regulating valve depending on the outpout pressure of the converter and a control pressure depending upon further operating parameters. With the coupling open, the closing pressure in the closing pressure chamber remains below the internal pressure of the converter by a specified value. This ensures that the bridging coupling responds quickly and can be precisely regulated within narrow tolerances. In addition, only little power is needed for regulation.

Hydro-dynamic torque converter (1) with a 
lock-up clutch (5), actuated by an annular piston (6), 

whose first operating surface (9) is pressurized in 
opening direction by the inner pressure of the converter 

(1) and whose second operating face (10) is pressurized 
in closing direction by a closing pressure 

existing within a closing pressure chamber (8), whereas 
a pilot controlled regulating valve (14) regulates 

both the closing pressure during closing and the 
pressure of the lock-up clutch (5) in closed condition 

to give a value which is larger than the inner pressure 
of the converter (1), characterized in that the pilot 

controlled regulating valve (14) maintains the 
closing pressure during the opening phase of the 

lock-up clutch (5) at a preset pressure below the inner 
pressure of converter (1), so that the closing 

pressure chamber (8) remains permanently charged while 
lock-up clutch is opened an
d the closing pressure is 
unequal zero. 
Hydro-dynamic torque converter according to 
claim 1, characterized in that both the starting pressure 

of the torque converter (1) and a modulated control 
pressure depending on other operating parameters 

is acting as pilot control pressure on the pilot controlled 
regulating valve (14). 
Hydro-dynamic torque converter according to 
claim 1, characterized in that the regulating valve 

(14) comprises a valve housing (23) with a valve spool 
(26) with control collars (27, 28), whereas within the 

control spool (26) there are two similar spring-loaded 
pistons (33, 34) coaxially guided towards its faces,  

 
of which the second piston (34) is pressurized on its 

face end by a modulated control pressure and on the 
spring side by the outlet pressure of the torque converter 

(1), whereas the forces actuating on the piston 
(34) from the face end are always smaller than the 

forces acting on piston (34) on the spring side, and 
of which the first piston (33) is pressurized via an 

orifice (39) with the closing pressure and is connected 
with a sump (32) on the face end, and whereas 

the actuating faces on the valve spool (26) and the 
regulating springs (35, 36) are so coordinated, that 

the inner pressure of the torque converter (1) exceeds 
the closing pressure at the lowest possible modulated 

control pressure by a preset amount. 
Hydro-dynamic torque converter according to 
claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that a constant 

flow valve (17) retains the pressure agent stream of 
the modulated control pressure constant at a preset 

level.
