<ABSTRACT>
An article that includes at least two 
networks of high strength fibers and a matrix material 

which impregnates the high strength fibers to form a 
composite element having a first plane profile and a 

second plane profile, wherein at least one of the first 
and second plane profiles has on its surface a textured 

pattern, and the matrix material is distributed 
substantially uniformly over the textured plane 

profile, and a method for making the composite element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible
ballistic resistant article which includes a network of
high strength fibers in an elastomeric matrix material.Various constructions are known for
ballistic resistant articles such as vests, curtains,
mats, raincoats and umbrellas. These articles display
varying degrees of resistance to penetration by high
speed impact from projectiles such as BB's, bullets,
shells, shrapnel, glass fragments and the like. U.S.

4,457,985; and 4,403,012 describe ballistic resistant
articles which include high strength fibers made from
materials such as extended chain ultra-high molecular
weight polyethylene. Typically these fibers are
coated, embedded or impregnated with a matrix material
such as a polymeric composition or resin.U.S. Patents No. 5,061,545 and 5,093,158 (corresponding to WO 90/06389)
describe a composite layer of a high strength fibrous
network and a resin matrix wherein the fibrous network
is nonuniformly impregnated with the resin matrix. The
composite layer is formed by feeding the fluid resin
matrix onto a fibrous network and passing the resin
coated fibrous network through a gap between two
compression rolls, at least one of which has a
patterned surface. The patterned surface causes the
still fluid resin matrix to flow into a non-uniform
layer corresponding to the patterned surface. After
passing through the rolls, the resin coated fibrous
network layer is subjected to heat in order to remove
the solvent from the resin matrix, thereby forming a 
consolidated composite layer which can be used as a prepreg to form a
composite having more than one fibrous network. The resulting composite
layer has a distribution of resin which is in a pattern wherein there are areas
of the composite layer which are thick and have a greater resin to fiber ratio
and areas of the composite layer which are thinner and have a lower resin to
fiber ratio. The main objective of this composite layer is to increase the
volume ratio of fiber to resin which in turn increases the ballistic resistance of
a composite made from these layers.U.S. Patent No 5,124,195 describes a ballistic resistant article formed
from a fibrous web or composite web of two or more layers of high strength
fibers coated with a polymeric
