<ABSTRACT>
A range of supplementary services are currently provided by 
telecommunication 

network operators which it is only possible to obtain by sending a 
sequence of digits to the exchange. 
A telecommunications network has control means for providing one or 
more 

supplementary services to Customer's Premises Equipment (CPE) units 
connected to 

the network, one or more CPE units including programmable buttons (9), 
the operation 

of a button causing the transmission of a defined code to an exchange 
forming part 

of the network to access a supplementary service, there being 
programming means to programme the programmable buttons. 
The programming means may be means to transmit programming signals 
from 

the exchange to a CPE unit using Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) (2) 
signalling. 
Alternatively, the programming means may be a smartcard and a card 
reader 

connectable to the CPE unit, the smartcard being encoded with the 
programming information to programme the CPE unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
A range of supplementary services are currently provided by telecommunication 
network operators and it is likely that the range available will increase. Examples of the services which are or will become available are:-
 
   Call Waiting
 
   Call Diversion
 
   Charge Advice
 
   Three-party Call
 
   Call Back When Free
 
   Call Trace - indicates to exchange that a malicious call has been received and 
holds the call to enable the source to be traced.
 
   Return Last Call Received
 
   Query Last Call Received Contents - provides a display or spoken record of the 
source of the last call received. At present it is only possible to obtain the above services by sending a 
sequence of digits to the exchange. One way of encouraging subscribers to use the 
services is to simplify the operating process. The simplification proposed is to reduce the number of buttons that require to 
be pressed to operate a service, preferably to a single button, and to provide a facility 
for programming the buttons. The buttons could be similar to the stored memory  
 
buttons currently found on some telephone units. The facility could be provided for 
a range of Customer's Premises Equipment (CPE), but the most likely use is with a 
telephone. According to the present invention there is provided a telecommunications 
network comprising control means for providing one or more supplementary services 
to Customer's Premises Equipment (CPE) units connected thereto, wherein one or 
more CPE units include programmable buttons, whereby the operation of a button 
causes the transmission of a defined code to an exchange forming part of the network 
to access a supplementary service, further comprising programming means to 
programme the programmable buttons. The programmable means may comprise means to transmit programming 
signals from the exchange to a CPE unit using Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) 
signalling. Alternatively, the programming means may comprise a smartcard and a card 
reader connectable to the CPE unit, the smartcard being encoded with the 
programming information to programme the CPE unit. The present invention will now be described by way of example, with reference 
to the accompanying drawings, in which:- 
Figures 1(a), 1(b), 1(c) and 1(d) show the sequence of operation for obtaining 
two typical supplementary services and the programmable button equivalents; Figure 2 is a block diagram illustrating the programming procedure using FSK  
 
signalling; and Figure 3 is a block diagram illustrating the programming
