<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for distributing wound yarn (12) 
on a forming bobbin (1) driven by a grooved drive roller (9) in a 

collection station, in such a manner as to prevent ribbing 
during the continuous superposing of the various layers of 

winding, hence rendering the subsequent technical 
operations to be undergone by the bobbin yarn (12) both possible 

and simple. The invention also provides an apparatus for 
implementing the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
distributing wound yarn on a forming bobbin driven by a
grooved drive roller in a collection station for textile
yarns, bobbin and roller having shape different each other.
In other words, this invention relates to a method and
apparatus for distributing wound yarn on a conical bobbin
driven by a grooved cylindrical roller, or for distributing
wound yarn on a cylindrical bobbin driven by a grooved
cone.More specifically, said apparatus comprises a control unit
based on a mini-computer into which the operative winding
data are fed for processing and comparing with the data
arriving from transducer probes or similar means, to
provide at the minicomputer output a number of command
signals for activating and controlling the motive source
which angularly positions the bobbin carrier arm so that
the collection station operates in regions not subject to
the ribbing effect.In the ensuing description and claims, the term "yarn" or
"filament" indicates any type of filiform material, and the
term "bobbin" indicates any package formed from yarn wound
in substantially helical turns.In the state of the art a winding operation is used to form
the yarn into a package suitable for subsequent processing. Winding by dragging is known, in which the bobbin is driven
by friction by a grooved roller driven by the drive shaft.According to the above alternative cases, this roller can
be a cylindrical roller and then the produced bobbin is
conical, or this roller can be a conical or frusto-conical
element and then the produced bobbin is cylindrical.Within the helically arranged grooves the yarn is compelled
to follow their movement, so that the rotation of the
roller produces a corresponding rectilinear translation
movement of the yarn.With reference to this field of the art, the problems
strictly related to the principle of distribution of the
yarn on the forming bobbin are of considerable importance.The winding units or stations arranged to produce bobbins
of wound yarn almost always form deposits of turns
concentrated at certain points, to form ribbing. This yarn
distribution defect arises during the bobbin winding when a
wound turn is superposed on and parallel to the previous
turns.This phenomenon occurs if the bobbin circumference is equal
to the length of the winding turn, or to a multiple or a
sub-multiple thereof. This type of winding in the form of
substantially superposed turns results in hard bands within
the bobbin. Said ribbing is known hereinafter as ribbing,
tap

A method for distributing wound yarn (12) on a forming
bobbin (1) driven by a grooved drive roller (9) in a collection

station of a winding machine, in which bobbin and roller
have a different shape each other,

and the driving
contact line (38) therebetween is axially shifted,

towards the major or the minor diameter of the conical
element of the above bobbin-roller coupling, by the

variation of inclination of the bobbin (1) with respect to the
drive roller (9) in order to avoid the ribbing effect on the

bobbin, wherein

a forming conical bobbin (1) driven by a grooved
cylindrical drive roller (9) in a collection station of a

winding machine, for example an automatic winder, in which
in said collection station the grooved cylindrical roller (9)

rotates at constant rotational speed and the bobbin (1), which
rests under pressure on the grooved cylindrical drive

roller, is provided with the necessary rotation to cross
the yarn by unwinding it from the underlying feed package (11),

characterised by:

determining moment by moment the deposition distance
between two yarn turns successively deposited on the

surface of the conical bobbin (1) under formation;
on the basis of previously recorded successive variations
in distance between two consecutive turns, determining when

said distance falls below a predetermined minimum value, 
and when said distance again rises above said predetermined

minimum value;
before the distance between two consecutive yarn turns
falls below the predetermined minimum value, activating a

motive source (6) which by means of a lever linkage (27)
progress
ively inclines the conical bobbin (1) to vary its
transmission ratio (K) with the grooved cylindrical roller (9), in

order to maintain the distance between consecutive turns
about a value slightly greater than the predetermined

minimum value and to progressively increase the bobbin
inclination each time the distance between said consecutive

turns tends to fall, at least until the deposition of
consecutive turns at a distance apart less than the

predetermined minimum value ceases;
quickly restoring the initial conditions by operating the
motive source (6) to incline the bobbin in the opposite

direction, to annul the previously induced inclination and
cause a change in the transmission ratio (K), which at a

certain moment assumes a value corresponding to deposition
of turns at a distance apart less than the predetermined

minimum distance and even zero distance apart, but with a
rapidity such as to cause only an insignificant quantity of

turns to be deposited very close to or superposed on each
other, and which does not damage the quality of the bobbin

under formation.

to or superposed on each other, and which does not damage

the quality of the bobbin under formation.
An apparatus for implementing the method claimed in
claim 1 or 2,

in which bobbin (1) and roller (2) have a different shape each other, and the driving
contact line (38) therebetween is axially shifted,

characterised by comprising a control unit based
on a mini-computer (3) into which the values relating to the

winding parameters, those ribbing orders (K) considered
damaging to the quality of the winding underway, and the

predetermined minimum distance between two consecutive yarn
turns in one complete to-and-fro deposition of the yarn (12) on

the surface of the forming bobbin (1) are firstly fed via a
keyboard (7), said values being processed in the computing

centre of the mini-computer (3) for the computerised formation
of a group of curves each having a constant "winding ratio" (K)

of whole number or exact fraction considered dangerous, the
mini-computer then receiving electrical pulses generated at

each revolution, or submultiple thereof, of the grooved
drive roller (9) and bobbin carrier mandrel (31) by sensor discs (4,2)

applied to them, to unambiguously provide knowledge
of the rotational values of said members at each moment,

these latter values being compared with said operational 
winding parameters within the electronic comparator of the

mini-computer (3), in order to generate a number of command
signals in continuous succession to activate and control

the motive source (6) which angularly positions the bobbin
carrier arm (27) such that the collection station operates in

regions not in proximity to the ribbing effect.
An apparatus for distributing wound yarn on a forming
bobbin (1) as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that one

apparatus of the present invention is provided in each yarn
winding station.
A collection station having an apparatus
comprising a minicomputer (3) as control unit, which processes the rotational values of

the bobbin (1) and the roller (9) sensed by the sensors (2,4), which compares the
operational winding parameters with winding ratios considered to be dangerous, and

which generates command signals for the angular positioning of the bobbin carrier arm
(27), such apparatus enabling

yarn to be wound by distributing it on the forming
bobbin

according to the method of claims 1 or 2
such that this latter is free from damaging ribbing.
