<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for identifying automatically from an interlaced video 
recording the frames of an original cine-film sequence from which the video 

recording has been derived. The apparatus includes: means for evaluating 
for each successive pair of fields a function measuring correlation between 

adjacent odd and even picture lines taken from the first and second fields of 
the pair respectively; means for comparing the correlation function of each 

field pair with that of at least one neighbouring pair in the sequence; and 
means for identifying pairs with greater correlation than their neighbours as 

being derived from the same original film frame. The original frames are 
reconstructed and fed to an MPEG motion picture encoder to obtain high 

quality compressed video. Also provided is automatic scene cut detection 
which allows adaptive operation of the MPEG encoder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for identifying in an interlaced video
recording the frames of an original cine-film sequence from which the video
recording has been derived.The invention also relates to a video rate convertor and motion picture
encoder including such an apparatus.When a cine film has been transferred to a video recording (by a so-called
telecine operation), the differences between film and video standards generally do
not permit a simple 1:1 correspondence between video frames and film frames.
This is particularly true in view of the interlaced character of most video formats,
whereby the odd-numbered picture lines and the even-numbered picture lines of
each frame are transmitted in two separate fields. Even where a regular pattern of
correspondence exists in theory, it can be unknown, or it can become disrupted by
subsequent editing operations performed in the video domain.The inventors have recognised that for many applications it would be
advantageous to have an apparatus which could identify and perhaps re-construct
the original film frames from the fields of the video recording.A very important application of such a technique might be in data
compression video encoding systems such as the MPEG system standardised by
ISO. Such systems exploit the high degree of coherence both within and between
successive frames of a motion picture sequence to eliminate redundant information
while maintaining a good subjective picture quality. If the sequence being encoded
is a video recording made by telecine, the frames encoded might be a mixture of
fields taken from different film frames, which lack the coherence that was present
in the original frame. The output quality of the encoder is thus seriously reduced.Another possible application of the proposed apparatus may be suggested by
WO 92/09172, which describes a display system including interpolation of
additional lines between the lines of interlaced video fields. The system described
therein operates in different modes depending on whether the original picture
source is a video source or a telecine source. Unfortunately, the only solution
proposed in WO 92/09172 relies on flag signals being generated by the telecine
machine and included in the video signal to indicate whether the source is a video 
camera or telecine. Of course a vast number of films have already been transferred
to video without these special flag signals, and it will not be practical to return to
the original film source in most cases.One technique for identifying

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for identifying in an interlaced video recording the
frames of an original cine-film sequence from which the video recording has

been derived, the apparatus comprising:

means for receiving a sequence of video fields comprising the video
recording;
means for evaluating for each successive pair of fields a function
measuring correlation between adjacent odd and even picture lines

taken from the first and second fields of the pair respectively;
means for comparing the correlation function of each field pair with
that of at least one neighbouring pair in the sequence; and
means for identifying pairs with greater correlation than their
neighbours as being derived from the same original film frame.
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the correlation
function is evaluated twice for each pair of fields, reversing the roles of the

first and second fields.
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 wherein to identify each
original film frame a kernel of three successive fields is selected and the

correlation function evaluated and compared for the first pair and the second
pair of fields in the kernel, whereupon the pair with greater correlation is

identified as a 'best' candidate pair for identification as a film frame and the
kernel is advanced in the received sequence of video frames for the

identification of the next film frame.
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the kernel is advanced
in accordance with a preferred step size of at least two fields, which

preferred step size is adapted to a pull-down pattern specified for the video
recording, and further comprising means for detecting disruption of the

specified pull-down pattern, and for causing the kernel to be advanced in 
accordance with a step size different to the preferred step size until the

specified pull-down pattern is restored.
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 4 wherein the preferred step size
defines also a 'preferred' candidate field pair, and wherein the means for

detecting disruption of the pull-down pattern operates by detecting when the
'best' candidate pair is different to the 'preferred' candidate pair.
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, or 5 wherein the preferred
step size alternates between two fields and three fields after the

identification of each successive film frame.
An apparatus as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 6 further comprising
means for detecting a discrepancy between the number of received video

fields and the number of identified film frames, and for correcting the
discrepancy by discarding and inserting frame identifications as necessary.
An apparatus as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 7 further comprising
means for generating an output sequence of frames by interleaving lines

from identified pairs of video fields to generate an output sequence of video
frames corresponding to the identified film frames.
A motion picture encoder including an apparatus as claimed in
Claim 8 and further including means for encoding the generated sequence of

output frames for transmission or storage, wherein the encoder implements
inter-frame predictive coding, and wherein the apparatus yet further includes

means for detecting scene cuts by detecting candidate field pairs with less
correlation than their neighbouring pairs.
