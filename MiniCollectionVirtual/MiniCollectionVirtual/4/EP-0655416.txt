<ABSTRACT>
In a process for treating an aqueous solution containing cyanide compounds, heavy metals, particularly nobel metals, and hard complexing agents such as EDTA, NTA, DTPA and NTMP by alkaline high-temperature hydrolysis with development of ammonium formate, to achieve simultaneous detoxification and recovery of nobel metals on the one hand and degradation of hard complexing agents on the other hand, using an autoclave which can be realised with justifiable expenditure, it is provided that a control circuit is assigned to the autoclave used for the hydrolysis, the steam partial pressure being determined in the autoclave and kept constant via a controllable outlet control valve in such a way that after a steam partial pressure preset value corresponding to a preset reaction temperature is exceeded, inert gases are released via the outlet control valve to reduce pressure.

<CLAIMS>
Process of treating an aqueous solution containing cyanide compounds,
heavy metals, in particular precious metals, and stable complexes such as

EDTA, NTA, DTPA and NTMP complexes and their sequestering agents
by alkaline high-temperature hydrolysis with ammonium formate developing,


characterized in that
 a control loop (R) is allocated to the autoclave (5)
used for the hydrolysis, the partial water vapor pressure in the autoclave (5)

being detected and kept constant by way of a controllable discharge regulating
valve (13), in that after a desired value, corresponding to the given

reaction temperature, of the partial water vapor pressure is exceeded, inert
gases are blown off via the discharge regulating valve (13) for pressure reduction.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a reaction temperature
of approximately 240Â°C is set in the autoclave (5) by means of a heating

installation (9).
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the to-be-treated
aqueous solution supplied to the autoclave (5) has ambient temperature.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the precipitated sediments
are removed as a deposit from the bottom of the autoclave (5).
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the gaseous residual
products of the autoclave are subject to an ammonium recovery process. 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 hydrolysis takes place
at a pressure of approximately 40 bar.
Apparatus for putting into practice the process according to claims 1 to
6, 
characterized by
 an autoclave (5), in which a tank (11) suitable for the
take-up of water is disposed or which is in connection with such a tank

(11), respectively, in such a way that the autoclave (5) and the tank (11) are
of a uniform temperature in the process, a sensing probe (12) for the detection

of the partial water vapor pressure at the reaction temperature being
disposed in the tank (11).
Apparatus according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the controllable
discharge regulating valve (13) is topped by a heat exchanger (W1) which

is in pressure connection with the autoclave (5) or is disposed in the autoclave
(5), respectively.
Apparatus according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 an ammonium recovery
device (15) is disposed downstream of the autoclave (5).
