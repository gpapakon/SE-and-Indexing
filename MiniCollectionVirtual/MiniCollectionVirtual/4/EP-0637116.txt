<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a reusable apparatus for protecting a cable splice from
the elements, and especially for protecting cable splices that are to be buried. This
invention is also a method for protecting a spliced cable with the apparatus of this
invention.The cable splice protector of this invention is easily associated with separate
ends of a cable or cables to be spliced. When the ends of the cable or cables are spliced,
the apparatus of this invention is associated with the cable splice in a manner that
protects the splice site from moisture, dirt, and other contaminants.Kits for protecting cable splices are well known in the prior art. One form of
cable splice protector kit uses shrink-wrap. The shrink-wrap kit typically include a
connector for uniting two ends of a cable, a cylindrical rubber piece the surrounds the
connector, and a cylindrical piece of shrink wrap that is applied to the rubber covered
connector to seal the splice from the elements. Such shrink-wrap based cable splice
protector kits require a heat source in order to apply the shrink wrap. In addition, the
protective sheath formed by the shrink wrap is not reusable.A transition sealing device is available in the prior art that is able to seal a
cable transition through a wall or a panel. The cable transition sealing device includes
a shell having a threaded end complementary to a wall or panel, and end having a
collet. A sealing nut is complementary to the collet. The union of the sealing nut and
the collet compresses and seals a cable passing through the fitting.U.S. Patent 4,684,764 to Luzzi et al., describes a two piece locking housing for
protecting a high voltage cable splice. The locking housing uses rolled end seals to
prevent dirt and moisture from entering the housing.U.S. Patent 3,854,003 to Duret describes a connector for joining two ends of a
co-axial cable. The connector uses an annular wedge combined with a shell to
mechanically clamp and secure the cable. The connector does not include any type of
seal to protect the connection from dirt and moisture. U.S. Patent 3,573,346 to Appleby dlscloses a strain relief coupling. The strain
relief coupling includes an ellipsoidal member that is made up of armor rods overlying
an inner shell. The cable is surrounded by the ellipsoidal member which, when united
with the coupling housing transfers all strain from the cable to the housing.U.S. Patent 3,381,082 to Peterson describes a cable splicer. The cable splicer
described includes a plastic like substance that encases a
