<ABSTRACT>
A single moveable optical fibre 101 or a first pair of optical fibres 1,2 are held 
and fixed to a supporting member 51 in a cantilever form. Oppositely connected thereto 

is a second pair of optical fibres 3,4 that are fixed to a square hole 53 of the alignment 
material. Either two magnetic bodies 110a, 110b are attached to the single moveable 

optical fibre or a magnetic body 11, 12 is adhered to each of the first pair of optical 
fibres. Around the magnetic bodies, there are aligned hollow solenoid coils, 21, 22 and 

one pair or two pairs of permanent magnets 31a, 31b, 32a and 32b respectively which 
are oppositely aligned so as to have opposite polarities to each other. 
The single moveable optical fibre or the first pair of optical fibres can be 
switched to be connected to one or the other of the second pair of optical fibres to form a 

1 X N or 2 X 2 optical switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a switch. The present invention relates in 
particular, but not exclusively, to a mechanical optical switch for an optical fibre direct 
driving type which is applied to optical communications and other such applications. A mechanical optical switch has a structure for enabling an optical path to be 
switched directly driving an optical fibre. Such a mechanical optical switch is 
characterised by its simple structure and advantageously achieves little insertion loss, 
miniaturisation, and consumes little driving electric power. A number of switch structures of various types have been proposed in the past. 
Fig. 4 is a sectional view showing a conventional optical switch of the optical fibre direct 
driving type. The conventional optical switch includes: a movable optical fibre 301 
whose core line is fixed to a cylindrical tube 303 in a cantilever form; a magnetic body 
310, having a desired magnetic characteristic, being adhered to a surface of the movable 
optical fibre 301 in the vicinity of a tip thereof; a hollow solenoid coil 305 for inverting 
the magnetic poles of both ends of the magnetic body 310; a pair of permanent magnets 
307 which apply magnetic attraction to the magnetic body 310 in a direction vertical to 
an optical axis; two fixed optical fibres 302a, 302b fixed to a square hole formed within 
a columnar member 304; and a cylindrical sleeve 306 which aligns and holds the 
cylindrical tube 303 and the columnar member 304, and on which the solenoid coil 305 
and the permanent magnets 307 are fixed respectively. This switch operates as follows. The movable optical fibre 301 is magnetically 
attracted to one of the pair of permanent magnets 307 according to the magnetic poles of 
both the ends of the magnetic body 310. The tip of both the ends of the magnetic body 
310. The tip of the movable optical fibre 301 optically combines with one of the two 
fixed optical fibres 302 and 302b in a corner of the square hole formed within the 
columnar member 304. The solenoid coil 305 is energised and a magnetic field along 
the optical axis is applied to the magnetic body 310 to invert the magnetic poles of the 
magnetic body 310. Then, the movable optical fibre 301 is attracted toward the other  
 
permanent magnet, thereby optically combining with the other fixed optical fibre. Even 
when a current is not supplied, the magnetic body 310 can remain combined with one of 
the fixed optical fibres 302a and 302b because the magnetic body 310 is magnetically 
attracted
