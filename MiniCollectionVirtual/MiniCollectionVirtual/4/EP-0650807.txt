<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive article having a sheet-like structure 
having at least one major surface having deployed 

thereon a plurality of individual abrasive composites, 
each abrasive composite characterized by a plasticizer 

and a plurality of abrasive particles dispersed in a 
binder, wherein said binder is formed by polymerizing a 

binder precursor and said plasticizer being combined 
with said binder precursor prior to said polymerizing 

in an amount of 30 to 70 parts plasticizer per 100 
parts by weight of the combined binder precursor and 

plasticizer. There is also a method of using such as 
abrasive article to reduce the surface finish of a 

workpiece and a process of making the abrasive article.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an abrasive article
having a sheet-like structure having deployed thereon a
plurality of individual abrasive composites, each of
which is comprised of a plurality of abrasive particles
dispersed in a plasticized binder. The invention also
relates to a process of making such an abrasive article
and a method of using such an abrasive article to
reduce a workpiece surface to impart a relatively fine
surface on the workpiece being abraded.In general, abrasive articles comprise a plurality
of abrasive particles bonded either together (e.g., a
bonded abrasive or grinding wheel) or to a backing
(e.g., a coated abrasive). These abrasive articles
have been utilized to abrade and finish workpieces for
well over a hundred years. Within the last several
years, abrasive technology has grown to include
structured abrasives. These abrasive articles are
desirable because of their long life and high rate of
stock removal. It has been seen that a structured
abrasive can remove more stock than an abrasive coating
employing the same size of abrasive particles.Coated abrasives and structured abrasives can be
employed for polishing operations, i.e., providing a
very fine surface finish on the workpiece. However,
when an ultrafine surface finish is desired, such as
that required for an optical lens which require a clear
surface finish, loose abrasive slurries are typically
used.However, the use of loose abrasive slurries for
polishing and ultrafine finishing has drawbacks. For
instance, the use of a loose abrasive slurry can be
rather untidy as the extraneous slurry is thrown about 
in the work area by the motion of the lapping or
polishing wheel or block. Also, the use of loose
abrasive slurries can be less cost efficient as it may
be difficult to estimate up front the minimal amount of
needed abrasive material. This leads to the use of
excessive amounts of abrasive, equipment and manpower.
The industry has sought means to generate an ultrafine
surface finish without the need to use a loose abrasive
slurry.A method for polishing using a solid abrasive
polishing material has been proposed as a substitute
for a loose abrasive slurry, such as disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 3,042,509 to Soderburg. The abrasive
material is constituted by a dispersion of abrasive
particles in a binder where the binder is based on a
water-soluble binder such as polyethylene glycol ester.
Polyethylene glycol is blended with this water-soluble
binder to provide a solid substance that is exemplified
as formable into a

An abrasive article comprising a
structure in the form of a sheet, the structure

having at least one major surface (13) having
placed thereon a plurality of individual abrasive

composites (11, 21), each abrasive composite (11, 21) having
a precise shape defined by a distinct and discernible boundary (18)

and having a plurality of abrasive particles (14, 24) dispersed in a
plasticized binder (15, 25), and said binder (15, 25) having been formed

plasticizer comprises a polyol selected from the group

consisting of polyethylene glycol, methoxypolyethylene
glycol, polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol,

glycerol, polyvinyl alcohol, and combinations thereof.
