<ABSTRACT>
A method of correcting a digital signal is employed in a receiver particularly to correct a received signal resulting from a signal sent over a propagation medium exhibiting time-variable frequency selectivity. The signal sent comprises reference symbols and information symbols. The method comprises the correlation of reference symbols (SBRm,nb) of the signal received by a base of orthogonal functions (Fm,nb) into coordinates (CRm,nb), the calculation of the transfer function of the propagation medium as a function of the said coordinates, the calculation of the complex conjugate (FT

) of the said transfer function, and the multiplication of the information symbols (SIRm,ni) by the complex conjugate of the transfer function.
