<ABSTRACT>
An RF waveguide signal transition apparatus for minimising leakage at RF frequency is described which consists of providing a plurality of plated through-holes (16) of blind holes in a circuit board (10). The plated holes (16) are disposed on the circumference of a circle around the RF waveguide to microstrip transition of probe (14) and each of the plated holes (16) is connected to a ground plane (24). The size of distribution of the plated holes provides a barrier to signal leakage at RF frequencies in the range 10.95-11.7 GHz and they also provide a transition impedance similar to the 50 ohm characteristic impedance providing satisfactory matching and minimising leakage into the board. The apparatus can also be used to minimise leakage from microstrip to microstrip transitions passing through the circuit board.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a waveguide to
microstrip transition where a waveguide probe is passed
from the waveguide through a circuit board before
connecting to the microstrip line. The invention also
relates to a microstrip to microstrip transition where a
signal carried on the microstrip requires to pass through
a multilayer circuit board. The invention is
particularly related to transitions for use with radio
frequency signals.In a double-sided or multilayer circuit board which
is connected to a waveguide, one way in which signals may
be taken from the waveguide to the board requires a probe
to pass through the waveguide wall and the board so that
when the probe protrudes into the waveguide it will pick
up signals propogating in the waveguide. In order for
such an arrangement to work properly it is necessary to
connect the probe to a microstrip conductor. This is
typically done by drilling a hole in the circuit board
prior to etching the board then fitting a probe in the
drilled hole. This arrangement would provide a low loss
transition as long as there is no or little loss of signal
into the board's materials, such as the PTFE and FR4, and
the probe passing through the board's materials does not
present too great a mismatch. However, with the 
arrangement shown in Fig. 1 the transition is lossy
resulting in over 1dB. of loss. This is unacceptable
for a low-noise receiver. It is believed that the
ground planes on each side of the FR4 act as a parallel
plate waveguide into which signals can couple resulting
in extra losses and also changing the impedance of the
transition causing a mismatch to the microstrip line;
any mismatch will also result in loss of signal.A stripline to stripline transition is disclosed in
EP-A-0318311. This transition includes a coaxial
section formed by resilient centre conductor surrounded
by a incomplete circle of conductive pins connected to
outer ground planes to form an outer conductor. In
another embodiment, an incomplete coaxial conductor is
formed. This reference teaches the use of pins extending
through the circuit board to provide an outer conductor
for a coaxial layer through the circuit board. There is
no disclosure of a structure to prevent signal leakage
into a fibreglass resin layer.An object of the present invention is to provide an
improved transition which obviates or mitigates at least
one of the aforementioned disadvantages.In its broadest aspect this is achieved by providing
a plurality of plated holes in a circuit board and
disposing these around
