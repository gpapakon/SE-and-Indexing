<ABSTRACT>
There is described a semiconductor memory comprising a 
matrix of lines and columns of memory cells, wherein the 

columns (BL) are grouped together in sectors, each sector 
representing the portion of the matrix itself related to a data 

input/output line. Each sector is in turn divided into packets 
(1) of columns, and there are redundancy columns (BLR) suitable 

for replacing a matrix column (BL) containing defective memory 
cells. Each of the redundancy columns (BLR) is included in a 

respective packet (1). The memory also comprises control 
circuits (5,6,7) to execute the abovementioned replacement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory with
memory matrix comprising redundancy cell columns associated
with single matrix sectors.In the manufacture of semiconductor memories defects are
frequently encountered that afflict a limited number of cells
of the memory matrix. The reason for the high probability of
defects of this type resides in the fact that in a
semiconductor memory chip the greater part of the area is
occupied by the matrix of memory cells itself.In order to avoid that the presence of a limited number of
defective memory cells on many millions force the rejection of
the entire chip, the technique is known of providing for the
manufacture of a certain number of additional memory cells,
commonly called "redundancy cells", to be used as a replacement
of those cells that, during testing of the integrated
component, prove defective; the circuits, with which the
integrated component must of necessity be provided, designed to
operate the abovementioned functional replacement of a
defective cell with a redundancy cell are indicated as a whole
with the name of "redundancy circuits", while the set of
redundancy cells and circuits are defined for short as 
"redundancy".Since semiconductor memories are organized in matrix
structures wherein the single memory cells are located at the
intersection of rows (known as "word lines") and of columns
(known as "bit lines") of the matrix itself, what takes place
in practice is the replacement of those rows or of those
columns containing defective cells with as many rows or
columns of redundancy cells (known as "redundancy rows" and
"redundancy columns", respectively), storing the configuration
of address signals corresponding to each defective line or
column in special non-volatile memory registers (for example,
fuses, or programmable but non-erasable memory cells) so that
whenever said combination of signals shows up again at the
input of the integrated component the replacement is
automatically executed and, instead of accessing the defective
cells, access is gained to the redundancy cells that replace
them.A first embodiment of redundancy provides for the presence
of groups of redundancy bit lines, where each of these groups
is associated with a respective sector of the memory matrix,
comprising a given number of bit lines of memory cells,
constituting the portion of the memory matrix itself related to
a data input/output Line of the integrated component.For the purposes of the selection of a particular bit line,
each of the abovementioned
