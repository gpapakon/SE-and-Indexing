<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sensor system with a 
number of sensor stations for surveillance of an area 

intended to include an object to be protected. The sensor 
stations (1-4) are essentially distributed along the 

periphery of a circle (5). Each sensor station comprises 
a detector unit (11) arranged to scan the arc in an 

azimuth sector allocated to it in two detection fields 
(9,10). The time of passage T of a target which passes 

the two detection fields is measured and the target 
position is calculated on the basis of the measured time 

T, the target speed V
missile
, the angle between the detection 
fields α and the angle to the target β. In the 

sensor system, the scanning is carried out from below and 
up towards the background of the sky. This implies that 

the scanning is not interfered by the surrounding 
terrain and that a large IR area is obtained. The sensor 

system according to the invention increases the possibilities 
of detecting low-flying missiles and similar 

targets in comparison with conventional technology

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sensor system
comprising a plurality of sensor stations for monitoring
an area intended to include an object to be protected.The increased use of so-called "stand-off"
weapons today and presumably in the future increases the
requirement for being able to detect small targets at a
low altitude. By "stand-off" weapons are meant in this
connection weapons which can be fired at a short distance
outside the range of the anti-aircraft defence and which
autonomously steer themselves to the target. One trend is
that these weapons are increasingly utilizing the existing
terrain protection. The main problem for the anti-aircraft
defence is to discover these weapons in time so
that effective countermeasures can be taken.In current reconnaissance technology, on the one
hand radar scanners and on the other hand IR scanners are
used. The weak points of the scanners have long been
known. With respect to radar scanners, problems caused by
radar shadows, terrain obstacles and ground clutter can
be mentioned. Terrain obstacles, low IR signature in the
forward sector of approaching missiles, low contrast and
false targets from ground objects constitute problems
with IR scanners. To cover a greater surveillance area,
information from a plurality of surveillance areas of
scanners can be collected together in a common centre.An example of a sensor system for surveillance of an area comprising two
sensors is known from DE-C-977 816. Based upon azimuth and elevation angles to a
target detected by the two sensors, the position of the target may be determined if the
distance between the two sensors are known. The sensors operate with large aperture
angles of about 180°. The problems discussed for IR scanners in the foregoing
paragraph also applies to this exemplified sensor system.The object of the present invention is to produce
a sensor system which is better capable of discovering
low-flying objects in time than today's systems. The
object of the invention is achieved by means of a sensor
system characterized in that the sensor stations are
distributed essentially along the periphery of a circle
in the central part of which an object to be protected is
intended to be contained, that each sensor station
comprises a detector unit which respective detector unit
is arranged to scan the arc in an azimuth sector,
allocated to it, up towards the background of the sky in
two detection fields, and that the time of the passage of
a target between the detection fields is measured in each
sensor station
