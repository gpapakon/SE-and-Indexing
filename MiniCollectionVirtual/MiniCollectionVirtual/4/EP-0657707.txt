<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerator has a fermentation section (106) 
adapted to receive a food product, and a heater (113) 

for warming food product therein. The fermentation 
section (106) can be in the form of a recess, and a food 

product removably supported therein using a holder 
(115). When mounted in the recess, the holder 

substantially closes the open face of the recess to 
isolate the fermentation section (106).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refrigerator and, more
particularly, to the manufacture of fermented foods for
storage therein.Fermentation processes are used to produce various
foods, such as yoghurt, which are sold by retailers.
However, these products are often expensive. As a
consequence, some consumers have chosen to carry out the
fermentation process themselves. This was normally
accomplished in a fermentation container, with the
fermented product transferred to one or more other
containers for storage.Refrigerators including a fermentation section according to the preamble
of claim 1 are known for example from US-A-5 228 499. Such
refrigerators are expensive to manufacture.The present invention aims to simplify the
manufacture of such refrigerators.
According to the invention a refrigerator includes a
fermentation section adapted to receive a food product,
and a heater for warming food product therein,
and is characterized in that the fermentation section is defined on the inner side of the refrigerator door.The temperature of food product in the fermentation
section of a refrigerator according to the invention is
preferably monitored by a sensor, and can be controlled
in response to signals generated by the sensor. This
enables the fermentation process to be managed with
minimum manual control.An embodiment of the invention will now be
described by way of example and with reference to the
accompanying drawings wherein:
Figure 1 if a perspective view of a refrigerator
with a fermentation device mounted in the door;Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view of the
fermentation device of Figure 1 along the line A-A.In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in
the Figures, a fermentation device is mounted against a
door lining 102 on the inner side of the refrigerator
door 101. A box or housing 104 defines a fermentation section
106 in the form of a recess in which a container 10 is
held in a cup or holder 115. The cup can substantially
close the open side of the recess to minimise any heat
loss therefrom to the interior of the refrigerator. The
cup shown in the Figures has a handle 114. The box 104
comprises an outer case 107 and an inner case 108 with
insulating material 109 therebetween, which are fastened
together by bolts 111. Bolts 110 fix the box 104 to a
bracket 103 on the inner side of the door lining 102.A heater 113 is provided at or just below the
recess 106, and a sensor 112 is mounted on the inner
case 108 to monitor the temperature in the recess. The
heater is controlled by a controller (not
