<ABSTRACT>
An ultra-low NOx gas turbine combustor having a 
dual fuel capability. The combustor has a pre-mixing zone (14) 

and a downstream combustion zone (10). The pre-mixing zone has 
three concentric annular passages (30,31,32) that surround a central 

diffusion-type dual fuel nozzle (33). Gas fuel manifolds (34,35) 
distribute gas fuel around the inner and outer passages. 

A plurality of dual fuel nozzles (38) are disposed in the middle 
passage to distribute either gas or oil fuel around the 

middle passage. The distribution of fuel around the 
passages allows the formation of lean fuel/air ratios, 

thereby lowering NOx formation. In addition, swirl vanes 
are arrayed around the inner and outer passages and around 

each of the fuel nozzles. A step increase in the flow area 
in going from the pre-mixing zone to the combustion zone 

creates vortices that tend to anchor the flame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combustor
capable of burning two fuels in compressed air. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a combustor
for a gas turbine capable of operating on either a gaseous
or liquid fuel that significantly reduces the amount of NOx
produced by combustion.In a gas turbine, fuel is burned in compressed
air, produced by a compressor, in one or more combustors.
Traditionally, such combustors had a primary combustion
zone in which an approximately stoichiometric mixture of
fuel and air was formed and burned in a diffusion type
combustion process. Additional air was introduced into the
combustor downstream of the primary combustion zone.
Although the overall fuel/air ratio was considerably less
than stoichiometric, the fuel/air mixture was readily
ignited at start-up and good flame stability was achieved
over a wide range in firing temperatures due to the locally
richer nature of the fuel/air mixture in the primary
combustion zone.Unfortunately, use of such approximately stoichiometric
fuel/air mixtures resulted in very high temperatures
in the primary combustion zone. Such high temperatures
promoted the formation of oxides of nitrogen ("NOx"),
considered an atmospheric pollutant. It is known that
combustion at lean fuel/air ratios reduces NOx formation.
Such lean burning, however, requires that the fuel be well
distributed throughout the combustion air without creating 
any locally rich zones. Unfortunately, the geometry
associated with such fuel distribution creates a complex
structure that makes the incorporation of a dual fuel
capability into the combustor extremely difficult.Reference is made to EP-A-0455487 which represents an
example of a known combustor. As will appear hereinafter,
the combustor of the invention differs essentially from
what is disclosed in EP-A-0455487 by the use of first and
second concentrically arranged annular passages surrounding
the first fuel nozzle and means for introducing a liquid
fuel into the first passage so as to circumferentially
distribute said gaseous fuel around said second passage.Accordingly, it is the general object of the current
invention to provide a combustor that is capable of stable
combustion with very lean mixtures of fuel and air, so as
to reduce the formation of NOx, and which operates on
liquid as well as gaseous fuel.Briefly, this object, as well as other objects of the
current invention, is accomplished in a gas turbine, comprising
(i) a compressor for compressing air, (ii) a
combustor for producing a hot
