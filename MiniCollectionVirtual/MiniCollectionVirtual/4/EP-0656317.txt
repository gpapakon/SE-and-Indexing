<ABSTRACT>
A process for the catalytic partial oxidation of a hydrocarbon 
feedstock comprises contacting a feed comprising a hydrocarbon 

feedstock and an oxygen-containing gas with a catalyst in a reaction 

zone, which catalyst is retained in the reaction zone in a fixed 
arrangement having a tortuosity of at least 1.1 and having at least 

750 pores per square centimetre.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the catalytic 
partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, in particular to a process for 
the preparation of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen from 
methane, natural gas, associated gas or other sources of light 
hydrocarbons. The partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, for example methane or 
natural gas, in the presence of a catalyst is an attractive route 
for the preparation of mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, 
known in the art as synthesis gas. The partial oxidation of a 
hydrocarbon is a highly exothermic reaction and, in the case in 
which methane is the hydrocarbon, proceeds by the following 
reaction:

2CH₄ + O₂ → 2CO + 4H₂


 
   A number of process regimes have been proposed in the art for 
carrying out the catalytic partial oxidation reactions. One regime 
that is most suitable for application on a commercial scale is to 
contact the feed gases with the catalysts retained in a fixed 
arrangement, for example as a fixed bed of particles or a monolith 
structure. The literature contains a number of documents disclosing 
details of experiments conducted into the catalytic partial 
oxidation of hydrocarbons, in particular methane, employing a wide 
range of catalysts in a fixed bed arrangement. European Patent Application publication No. 0 303 438 (EP-A-0 
303 438) discloses a process for the catalytic partial oxidation 
of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock in which a gaseous mixture of the 
hydrocarbonaceous feedstock, oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas and, 
optionally, steam, is introduced into a catalytic partial oxidation 
zone to contact a catalyst retained therein. The catalyst employed 
in the process may comprise a wide range of catalytically active 
components, for example palladium, platinum, rhodium, iridium, 
osmium, ruthenium, nickel, chromium, cobalt, cerium, lanthanum and  
 
mixtures thereof. Further, it is stated in EP-A-0 303 438 that 
materials not normally considered to be catalytically active may 
also be employed as catalysts, for example refractory oxides such as 
cordierite, mullite, mullite aluminium titanate, zirconia spinels 
and alumina. The catalyst may be of a variety of forms, for example 
sheets of corrugated metal packed to form elongate channels 
therethrough or wire mesh. However, preference is given in EP-A-0 
303 438 to the use of catalysts in the form of extruded honeycomb 
monoliths. These monoliths comprise a large number of parallel 
channels extending through the structure in the direction of flow of 
the
