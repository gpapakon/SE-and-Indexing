<ABSTRACT>
Amplifier circuit having temperature compensation for a 
sensor for a state variable to be measured, which amplifier circuit 

comprises a temperature-sensitive element at least for temperature 
compensation of the sensitivity, a temperature-compensation circuit 

for the zero point and an output amplifier connected to the sensor. 
Starting from the one temperature-sensitive component mentioned, a 

first signal conditioner for generating the desired temperature 
signal for the sensitivity compensation is connected to the sensor 

and a second signal conditioner for generating the desired temperature 
signal for the zero-point compensation is connected to the

input of the first signal conditioner is connected to a tapping 
point of a first resistor divider connected in series with the 

temperature-sensitive component across the first and second terminals 
of the supply voltage and the second input is connected to a 

reference voltage which is tapped off from a second voltage divider 
connected across the terminals of the supply voltage. The first 

input of the second signal conditioner is connected to the tapping 
point mentioned or to the output of the first signal conditioner and 

the second input is connected to the reference voltage mentioned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an amplifier circuit having temperature 
compensation for a sensor for measuring a state variable, which amplifier 
circuit comprises a temperature-sensitive element at least for temperature 
compensation of the sensitivity, a temperature-compensation circuit 
for the zero point, and an output amplifier connected to the sensor. Such 
an amplifier circuit with sensor is disclosed, for example, in 
EP 0 239 094 B1. With the developments in microelectronic technology, sensors have 
been manufactured with improved design and low cost, while still providing 
improved performance. Such sensors are therefore being used increasingly 
for the measurement of pressure, acceleration, speed and the like, 
in conjunction with a subsequent signal conversion. In this connection, 
the dependence on temperature is important and a temperature compensation 
feature has to be used in virtually every practical application. In particular, 
in modern motor-vehicle control systems, bridge sensors would 
have to be able to function over a wide temperature range and with great 
accuracy. The sensor amplifier circuit disclosed in the abovementioned 
European patent specification has a temperature-sensitive element in 
series with the sensor. In accordance with the linearity of its characteristic, 
said element will ensure that the sensitivity characteristic 
for the sensor is compensated for over the temperature range. Furthermore, 
a zero-point adjustment with temperature compensation of the sensor 
is achieved with the aid of a resistance circuit which is connected to an 
amplifier at the output of the sensor and comprises a temperature-sensitive 
element. This known circuit, however, has been found to be difficult 
to calibrate due to the mutual influencing of the adjustment elements. 
Typically, an iterative adjustment process is required because a compromise 
is made between the linearity of its temperature behaviour and the 
temperature coefficient. Furthermore, separate temperature-sensitive 
elements are required in this known circuit for sensitivity compensation 
and for zero-point adjustment compensation. An object of the invention is to obviate the abovementioned problems 
and to provide a sensor amplifier circuit having temperature compensation 
for a state variable, in which amplifier circuit the sensitivity 
compensation and the zero-point adjustment compensation are effected 
separately from one another and require only one temperature sensitive  
 
element. Another object of the invention
