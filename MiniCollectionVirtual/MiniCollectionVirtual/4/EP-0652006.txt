<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the discovery 
that a group of 2-phenyl-3-aryl-dihydrobenzopyrans are 
useful for lowering serum cholesterol. All mammalian cells require cholesterol as a 
structural component of their cell membranes and for non-sterol 
end products. The very property, however, that 
makes cholesterol useful in the cell membranes, its 
insolubility in water, also makes it potentially lethal. 
When cholesterol accumulates in the wrong place, for 
example within the wall of an artery, it cannot be readily 
mobilized and its presence leads to the development of an 
atherosclerotic plaque. Elevated concentrations of serum 
cholesterol associated with low density lipoproteins 
(LDL'S) have been demonstrated to be a major contributing 
factor in the development and progression of 
atherosclerosis. Estrogen, particularly when taken orally, lowers 
plasma levels of LDL and raises those of the beneficial 
high density lipoproteins (HDL's). Long-term estrogen 
therapy, however, has been implicated in a variety of 
disorders, including an increase in the risk of uterine 
cancer and possibly breast cancer, causing many women to 
avoid this treatment. Recently suggested therapeutic 
regimens, which seek to lessen the cancer risk, such as 
administering combinations of progestogen and estrogen, 
cause the patient to experience unacceptable bleeding. 
Furthermore, combining progesterone with estrogen seems to 
blunt the serum cholesterol lowering effects of estrogen. 
The significant undesirable effects associated with 
estrogen therapy support the need to develop alternative 
therapies for hypercholesterolemia that have the desirable 
effect on serum LDL but do not cause undesirable effects.  Attempts to fill this need by the use of 
compounds commonly known as antiestrogens, which interact 
with the estrogen receptor and/or bind what has been termed 
the antiestrogen binding site (AEBS), have had limited 
success, perhaps due to the fact that these compounds 
generally display a mixed agonist/antagonist effect and are 
subject to the same adverse effects associated with 
estrogen therapy. The current invention provides methods for 
lowering serum LDL levels without the associated adverse 
effects of estrogen therapy, and thus provides an effective 
and acceptable treatment for hypercholesterolemia. This invention provides new methods for lowering 
serum cholesterol levels, comprising administering a 
compound of formula (I): 
wherein:
 
   R¹ and R² are, independently, -H, -OH, halo, 
-OC₁-C₁₇
