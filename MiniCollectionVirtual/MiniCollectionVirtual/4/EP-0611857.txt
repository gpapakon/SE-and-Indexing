<ABSTRACT>
Stepped grandstand including a plurality of telescopic elements each one supporting at least one row of neighbouring seats, these elements exhibiting different successive heights, decreasing evenly from one element to the next from the top to the bottom of the grandstand, each element being capable of being housed respectively under the previous one whilst surmounting the next one in the folded-up position of the grandstand, whilst, in the unfolded position, in which each element is completely extracted from the previous one and located in front of it, each row of seats is offset with regard to the previous one situated at a higher level and also with regard to the one which is after it at a lower level. According to the invention, this grandstand is characterised in that each element (2) includes a member (14, 15) for recentring in the plane which contains the direction of unfolding of the grandstand such that, by degrees, the directions of displacement of all the successive elements are strictly mutually parallel.
