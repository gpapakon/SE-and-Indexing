<ABSTRACT>
A positioner element (21), preferably in the form of a reference star, has at least one reference point (22a,b,c) with reflecting surface and is attached to a positioner-detector element (24a,b) which is in the form of at least one plate of variable thickness inserted into the cutting-block. The plates can turn or move on an axis parallel with the normal.

<CLAIMS>
A system for positioning an incision block (1), comprising:

a reference star (21), with at least one reference point (22a, 22b, 22c), whose
spatial position can be detected;
an incision block (1), with a guide slit (1a); and
at least one plate (24a, 24b) which may be inserted into the guide slit (1a) of the
incision block (1) and which is firmly connected to said reference star (21).
The system as set forth in claim 1, wherein at least two plates (24a, 24b) are provided,
which are preferably of different thicknesses.
The system as set forth in claim 1 or 2, wherein at least one plate (24a, 24b) can be
rotated and/or shifted about an axis, parallel to its vertical.
A system for positioning an incision block (10), comprising:

a reference star (31), with at least one reference point (33a, 33b, 33c), whose
spatial position can be detect
ed;
an incision block (10), with holes; and
a hole template (34) which is firmly connected to said reference star (31) and
comprises holes (35a, 35b) which are arranged in correspondence with holes of the

incision block (10).
A system for positioning an incision block (10), comprising:

a reference star (31), with at least one reference point (33a, 33b, 33c), whose
spatial position can be detected;
holding elements (36);
an incision block (10), which can be slipped onto said holding elements (36); and
a hole template (34) which is firmly connected to the reference star (31) and
comprises holes (35a, 35b) for inserting the holding elements (36).
The system as set forth in claim 5, wherein said hole template (34) comprises at least
two holes (35a, 35b).
The system as set forth in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the reference star
(21, 31) comprises at least three elements (22a, 22b, 22c; 33a, 33b, 33c) with

reflecting surfaces.
The system as set forth in any one of the preceding claims, comprising a device (40)
for attaching a positioning element (41) to a bone, in a stable manner.
