<ABSTRACT>
With the lasers being formed on a single semiconducting plate, the emission wavelength  lambda 1 of one of the lasers is determined optically. The emission wavelength  lambda  of each other laser is determined by electrical measurements relating to the current I injected into this laser and the voltage V across its terminals and using the formula  lambda  =  DELTA  + 1.24x(V - Rxl)
<
-1
>
 where R is the dynamic resistance of the laser for I greater than the threshold current of the laser.  DELTA  is determined using this formula when applied to a laser whose emission wavelength is equal to  lambda 1. Application to optical telecommunications.

Method of determining the emission wavelength of Fabry-Pérot 
cavity semiconductor lasers formed on the same semiconducting 

plate, this method being characterised in that the emission 
wavelength λ1 of one of the lasers of the plate is determined by 

optical measurements, in that the plate is cut into small bars, 
each small bar being constituted by a set of lasers, and in that 

the emission wavelength λ of each laser of each small bar is 
determined by electrical measurements relating to the current I 

injected into this laser and to the voltage V between the 
terminals thereof, and by using the formula: 


λ = ▵ ÷ 1.24 x (V - R x I)
-1
 
   where R represents the dynamic resistance of this laser for 

a current I greater than the threshold current of this laser, ▵ 
being a parameter which takes substantially the same value for 

all the lasers of the plate and which is determined using this 
formula by applying it to the laser whose emission wavelength is 

equal to λ1.
