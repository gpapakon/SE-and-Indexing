<ABSTRACT>
The device has a garbage reception container which is provided with a lid (8) to be closed by hand. A balance (2) is operatively connected to the container (1) and detects weight variations. The lid (8) is provided with an opening device (9). This can be activated by means of a key element (13) to be pushed or inserted into a checking unit (3). With the lid (8) opened, the key element is retained by the checking unit (3) in response to the signal from a closing indicator (12) assigned to the lid (8). A payment device (6) for accepting a payment signalled to it by the balance (2) and dependent on the container weight sends, together with the closing indicator (12), when the lid (8) is closed, a return command to the checking unit (3) for the return of the key element (13) when the payment device (6) has accepted a payment which corresponds to the weight variation of the container (1) occurring between the opening and the closing of the lid (8).

Device comprising a container to receive waste, which 
container (1) is fitted with a manually locked lid (8), and a 

weighing mechanism (2) which co-operates with the container 
(1) detects changes in the weight of the container (1), and the 

lid (8) is provided with an opening device (9) which is activated 
by means of a key element (13) which is to be inserted or 

placed into a control unit (3), and with a pay mechanism (6) to 
receive a payment which is signalled by the weighing 

mechanism (2) and dependent on the container weight, and the 
control unit (3) firmly holds the key element (13) when the lid (8) 

is opened due to the signal of a lock register (12) which is 
associated with the lid (8), 
characterised in that
 the pay 
mechanism (6) will only after closure of the lid accept payment 

which relates to a change in weight of the container (1) which 
has occurred between opening and closing of the lid (8), and 

the pay mechanism (6) will together with the lock register (12) 
send a return command to the control unit (3) to release the 

key element (13) when the lid (6) has been closed. 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
weighing mechanism (2) is activated only when the key element 

(13) has been inserted or placed into the control unit (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
container (1) is protected from external forces at least when the 

weighing mechanism (2) is activated. 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the key 
element (13) is a key which is compatible with the key switch of 

the control unit (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the key 
element (13) is a magnetic tax card, and that the pay 

mechanism, which comprises a devaluating mechanism for the 
tax card, is integrated with the control unit (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the key 
element (13) is a bank note of a specified value.  

 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the pay 
mechanism (6) is an automatic till which accepts bank notes or 

coins, and the weighing mechanism (2) comprises a display (5) 
to display a charge due relative to a weight increase of the 

container.
