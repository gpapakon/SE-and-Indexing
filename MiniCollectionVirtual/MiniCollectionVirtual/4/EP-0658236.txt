<ABSTRACT>
A tube connector (10) to enable a straight tube or even a curved tube of tight radius of curvature to be connected to a structural member has a flat cutter disc (11) shaped to fit in the end of an internally splined tube (20). The outer edge of the cutter disc has a series of teeth (12) which cut into and locate with the splines when the cutter disc is rotated in the tube. The cutter disc may have a floating central insert (25) screw threaded to allow connection to another structural member without a need for precise alignment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tube and connector combination for use in 
structurally interconnecting a tube with another member, and an assembly of a 
tube and member interconnected by said tube and connector combination. 
It relates in 
particular, though not exclusively, to a structural interconnection 
incorporating a curved tube, such as may be utilised in a handail or 
balustrade assembly. Tube connectors for forming a structural interconnection with tubes 
are well-known and connectors of a type which provide a continuous flush 
surface for example between two tubes are used commonly in the 
construction of handrails and balustrades. An example of a connector of 
this type is described in GB-A-2070722. Another type of connector for 
joining tubes is described in US-A-4770560. Whilst known connector 
devices can provide a satisfactory interconnection they often place a 
limitation on the maximum allowable curvature of the end region of a tube 
to which a connection is being made, or the minimum axial length of tube 
or member to which a connection can be made. The present invention seeks to provide a tube and connector 
combination, and an assembly incorporating said tube and connector combination. In accordance with one of its aspects the present invention provides 
a tube and connector combination comprising a tube and a connector for 
insertion in an end of the tube, wherein the tube is internally splined and the 
connector comprises: 
a substantially planar disc-like cutter for insertion in the end of the 
internally splined tube,  abutment means offset from the centre of the cutter whereby 
application of torque to the abutment means may cause the cutter to  
 
rotate about a major axis passing through the centre of the cutter, 
and  at least three protruding tooth formations at the radially outer edge 
of the cutter, each formation having a cutting edge which faces 
radially outwards and extends substantially in a circumferential 
direction relative to the major axis of the cutter whereby rotation of 
the cutter about said major axis causes the teeth to cut into the 
internal splines of the tube.   Preferably an insert is positioned centrally relative to the cutter about 
said major axis, the insert being captively located axially relative to the 
cutter and possessing a limited range of free movement relative to the 
cutter. It is envisaged that usually the insert shall be capable of a limited 
range of free relative movement in a radial direction but alternatively or 
additionally it may

A tube and connector combination comprising a tube (20) and a 
connector (10) for insertion in an end of the tube, characterised in that the 

tube (20) is internally splined and the connector (10) comprises: a 
substantially planar disc-like cutter (11) for insertion in the end of the 

internally splined tube (20); abutment means (22) offset from the centre of 
the cutter whereby application of torque to the abutment means may cause 

the cutter to rotate about a major axis (14) passing through the centre of 
the cutter, and at least three protruding tooth formations (12) at the radially 

outer edge of the cutter each formation having a cutting edge (13) which 
faces radially outwards and extends substantially in a circumferential 

direction relative to the major axis of the cutter whereby rotation of the 
cutter (11) about said major axis causes the tooth formations (12) to cut 

into the internal splines of the tube (20). 
A tube and connector combination according to claim 1 characterised 
in that it comprises an insert (25) postioned centrally relative to the cutter 

(11) about said major axis (14), the insert being captively located axially 
relative to the cutter and possessing a limited range of free movement 

relative to the cutter, in the direction of at least one of a radial direction and 
an axial direction parallel with said major axis. 
A tube and connector combination according to claim 2 characterised 
in that the insert (25) is of a short tubular form and comprises a flange (28) 

at one end and a circlip groove (29) whereby a circlip (30) in said groove 
may provide axial retention of the insert relative to the cutter. 
A tube and connector combination according to claim 2 characterised 
in that the insert comprises a pair of limbs to extend through an opening in 

the cutter and allow the insert to be held to the cutter by clip action. 
A tube and connector combination according to any one of claims 2 
to 4 characterised in that the insert is provided with a screw-threaded 

through bore (27), and is restrained against free rotation relative to the 
cutter. 
A tube and connector combination according to any one of claims 2  
 

to 5 characterised in that the insert is positionable relative to the cutter in 
any selected one of a plurality of positions, said selectable relative positions 

preferably being angularly spaced by no more than 60Â°. 
A tube and connector combination according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that each tooth formation (12) has a 

cutting edge (13) of part spiral form, preferably of part spiral form and 
serrated. 
A tube and connector combination according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that a cutting edge is of spiral form and 

lies in a plane which is inclined relative to the major axis of the cutter, the 
cutter preferably comprising an even number of teeth (12) of spiral form, 

and said teeth being arranged in a balanced configuration in which one half 
are inclined in one direction and the other half in the opposite direction. 
A tube and connector combination according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the tooth formations are 

circumferentially spaced by recess portions (21) whereby in use the tube 
connector may be placed in the end of the splined shaft with the splines 

initially in register with said recesses and with the tooth formations in 
register with recesses between the tube splines. 
An assembly comprising a tube and another member structurally 
interconnected by a combination according to any one of claims 1 to 9 

characterised in that the tube is provided with an alignment member (75) 
which extends beyond the end of that tube into alignment with another 

member of the structural interconnection.
