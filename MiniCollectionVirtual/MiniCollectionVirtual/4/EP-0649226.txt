<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement for a long-wave radio ripple-control receivers for the reception of frequency-modulated ripple-control signals has, as a receiving antenna (1), two identical electromagnetically screened coils on a common ferrite rod. The coils are connected to two identically constructed low-pass filters (2, 3) which are connected on the output side to a differential amplifier (4). A mixing stage (5) and selection means (6) are connected downstream of the differential amplifier (4). The selection means are connected via an adjustable amplifier (7) to a frequency shift multiplier (8). A demodulator (9), which generates phase modulation from frequency modulation and demodulates it, is connected downstream of the frequency shift multiplier (8).
