<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to composite 
manufacturing techniques, and more particularly, to 
a mold that facilitates co-curing of composite 
stiffening members to one or both composite skin 
surfaces with the simultaneous curing of the 
composite skin. Many composite articles, for example, composite 
structural panels such as the center shear deck of a 
helicopter, require stiffening members to enhance 
the structural strength of the main structural 
panel. To ensure that such composite articles are 
functional for their intended purpose, the 
stiffening members must be rigidly secured to the 
main structural panel. In addition, the composite 
manufacturing technique must produce composite 
articles having smooth surface finishes, i.e., the 
fabrication technique must not induce distortions or 
defects in the skin surfaces of the main structural 
panel or the stiffening members. Composite structural articles having stiffening 
members have been fabricated, where possible, so 
that the stiffening members are all disposed on only 
one side of the main panel. This technique greatly 
simplifies the manufacturing process and ensures the 
suitability of the finished composite articles. Any 
one of several techniques may be utilized to form  
 
composite articles having stiffening members disposed on only one side of the 
main structural panel. Prepreg laminates comprising the main structural panel 
may be layed-up on a rigid mold, which provides the required surface finish for 
the main structural panel. The prepreg plies comprising the stiffening members 
may be layed-up on the prepreg laminates and maintained in place by means of a 
preformed mold, a semi-rigid membrane, or mandrels and a vacuum bag. The 
assembled mold may be placed in an autoclave and subject to a cure process 
wherein the stiffening members are simultaneously integrally bonded and co-cured 
in combination with the main structural panel. The preformed mold, the semi-rigid 
membrane, or the mandrels provide the required surface finish for the 
stiffening members. A more detailed description of the fabrication technique 
utilizing a preformed mold may be had by reference to United States Patent No. 
4,492,607. The '607 patent describes a molding assembly for producing an integrally 
stiffened panel (10) formed of T-shaped stringers or stiffeners (14) integrally 
connected to an outer skin (12). The molding assembly includes a base plate (34), 
a lay-up die (22) that comprises a border (24) formed by detachable closeouts (26, 
28,
