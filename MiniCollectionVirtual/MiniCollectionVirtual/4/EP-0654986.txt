<ABSTRACT>
A waste product collection unit has a base (1) with inflatable walls (2) enclosing and securely attached to the base (1) and a pouch (3) to contain hazardous liquids, semisolids and solids. The walls (2) are inflated by means of a connecting tube (5) with a non-return valve (6). The pouch into which waste liquids collect has an outlet tube (4) by which liquids may be safely drawn off and contained. After use, the unit is sealed by use of adherable means provided on the free edges of the walls of the unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a waste product collection unit. 
More particularly it relates to such a unit for use in a 
substantially sterile environment, such as an operating 
theatre. Increasingly, professionals in the medical and veterinary 
sciences are becoming aware of the risks of contracting 
infectious diseases from the body parts and fluids of man 
and animals. It is well-known that the viruses causing HIV, possibly 
leading to AIDS, and hepatitis and other related diseases, 
are transmitted from the body fluids, especially blood, of 
an infected person. If any such fluid enters the bloodstream of a doctor, 
surgeon or veterinary surgeon, during the course of 
operating on the patient, there is a grave danger of 
infection. During an operation, there may be large 
amounts of fluid present, both the blood of the patient 
and irrigation fluids diluting that blood, and these 
fluids may spread beyond the immediate area and there is a 
danger that they will contact the surgeon. Currently used collection units for hazardous body fluids 
and materials, are often bulky, do not allow the safe 
disposal of collected waste and they are not easily 
sterilised for the aseptic techniques required in the 
operating theatre for sterile procedures.  
 There is disclosed in US-A-759,084 (Eggers) and in 
US-A-1,741,836 (Gilbert) a waste product collection unit 
according to the pre-characterising portion of claim 1 
hereof. These devices are constructed so that they can be 
cleaned after use, in preparation for re-use. The devices 
include generally C-shaped inflatable walls as seen in 
plan view defining an outlet opening in said walls for the 
escape of liquid waste. A very significant shortcoming of such prior proposals 
lies in their inability to meet the needs of modern 
operating conditions and nursing conditions which demand 
careful disposal rather than re-use of such equipment. 
Risks of cross-infection of the patient during an 
operation can be reduced by collecting the fluids in any 
receptacle. However, extremely high standards of care, in 
relation to the risk of cross-infection of health care 
workers from patients with transmissible diseases, are 
desired in relation to the proper disposal of body tissues 
and liquids which inevitably remain on the surface of such 
a device after a surgical procedure and these conditions 
cannot be met by the prior art. It is believed that it is these shortcomings that have 
hindered the introduction of such devices for use in 
surgical procedures. As a result, the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A waste product collection unit for use in 
surgical procedures and the like, said unit comprising: 


a) a base (1) 
b) inflatable walls (2) having an inlet inflation 
tube (5); and 
c) a liquid collection area (3) communicating with 
said base for the collection of liquid therefrom and 

having an outlet tube (4) for removal of collected liquid; 
 
   characterised in that 


d) said unit is adapted for use in a substantially 
sterile environment by the provision of sealing means for 

said waste products within said unit after use, so as to 
produce a sealed waste product containment envelope; 
e) said sealing means for said waste products 
within said unit comprising said inflatable walls (2) 

being in surrounding relation to said base (1) so as to 
maintain a barrier to leakage of liquid therefrom; 
f) said sealing means for said waste product 
within said unit further comprising adherable means on the 

free edges of said inflatable walls which are in 
surrounding relation to said base; and 
g) said inflatable walls (2) serving, in use, to 
raise and support said adherable means with respect to 

said base (1) so as to define a sealable waste product 
containment volume within said walls and within said 

adherable means. 
A unit as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that said adherable means comprises at least one strip of 

adhesive tape protected by a release strip. 
A unit as claimed in either Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that opposed portions of the walls,  

 
optionally the portions on either side of a median plane 

of the base, are adapted to be adhered together to seal 
the interior. 
A unit as claimed in either Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that a sheet of material is provided to 

form a cover for the unit, sealing the interior thereof by 
adhesion to said adherable means. 
A unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said inlet and outlet tubes 

(5, 4) are so elongate that remote ends thereof, adapted 
for connection respectively to inflation means and 

exhaustion means, are adapted to extend outside the 
substantially sterile environment. 
A unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the outlet tube is provided 

with means to seal it after use. 
A unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the collection area (3) is 

separated from the base (1) by a sieve means. 
A unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said exhaustion means 

comprises a vacuum pump and/or a liquid receiver. 
A unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said inflation means 

comprises a source of compressed air or pump means and a 
non-return valve. 
A unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the unit, prior to use, is 

sterile and is packaged so to remain while outside the 
substantially sterile environment.
