<ABSTRACT>
A photographic processing method for developing (2) 
a film having been photographed, printing (3) the developed 

film on a photographic paper and developing the 
photographic paper, the film being accommodated in a 

cartridge (1) and set in a predetermined position of a 
photographic processing apparatus. The method includes 

the steps of: (a) providing the film or the cartridge (1) with 
an ID number for identifying the film; (b) making an index 

print in which respective images of a plurality of frames 
of the film are arranged in numeral order of the film; and 

(c) providing the index print with the ID number read from 
the film or the cartridge. With this method, one is able 

to find out in which film and in which frame of the film 
an image desired to be copy-printed is present.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic processing methods.
More particularly, it relates to a photographic processing method by which one is
able to easily find in which film and in which frame of the film an image desired to
be copy-printed is present.Conventionally, a developed film is divided into some pieces and
stored in a film sheet. Users can know contents of the film stored in the film sheet
by checking prints, to which the film is printed, one by one, or by holding the film
directly to the light.However, light intensity (or brightness) and hue of the developed film
is reverse of those of the printed photographic paper so that users cannot easily
know images of negatives, especially for colour photograph. When users wish to
make additional prints, therefore, it takes much time for them to know the specific
image and is difficult to distinguish the specific image among the other images if
images similar to the specific image exist in the film. Consequently, wrong film
numbers might be selected for additional prints.Further, in case that a developed film is stored in a film sheet, a problem
arises that not only time and labor are needed to cut the film into pieces but
also the operations for copy-printing the film are rendered troublesome since the
film is divided into some pieces. In addition, a film being stored in the film sheet is
likely to be folded. Still further, a used cartridge must be disposed of.A photographic processing method for providing an index print is
known form the US-A-5 051 773. Another photographic processing method for
providing photographic information, which was collected by a camera, on an index
print is known from the JP-A-05 011 353.In view of the foregoing circumstances, it is an object of the present
invention to provide a photographic processing method by which one is able to
easily specify in which film and in which frame of the film an image to be copy-printed 
is present.It is another object of the present invention to provide a photographic
processing method capable of reducing time and labor needed for copy-printing
while preventing a stored film from being folded.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
photographic processing method as defined in claim 1.According to another aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a photographic processing method as defined in claim 4.According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a photographic processing method as defined in claim 5. In the

<CLAIMS>
A photographic processing method including developing a film having been
photographed, accommodated in a

cartridge and 
set
 in a predetermined position of a photographic processing
apparatus, printing the developed film on a photographic paper and

developing the photographic paper, the method further comprising the steps of:

(a) providing the film or the cartridge with an ID number for
identifying the film, before it is developed;
(b) automatically detecting the ID number identifying the film during
processing using automatic sensors supplying output data to a central

processing unit;
(c) making an index print in which respective images of a plurality of
frames of the film are arranged in numeral order of the film; and
(d) using said central processing unit to provide the index print with the same ID
number identifying the film.
The method of Claim 1, wherein said developed
film is wound into said cartridge provided with said ID

number.
The method of Claim 1, wherein said film is
cut into pieces and then stored in a film sheet provided

with said ID number.
A photographic processing method including developing a film having been
photographed, accommodated in a

cartridge and set in a predetermined position of a photographic processing
apparatus, printing the developed film on a photographic paper and

developing the photographic paper, the method further comprising the steps of:

(a) winding the developed film into the cartridge after having been printed;
(b) making an index print in which respective images of a plurality of
frames of the film are arranged in numeral order of the film; and 
(c) using a central processing unit to automatically provide the cartridge and index
print with a common ID number.
