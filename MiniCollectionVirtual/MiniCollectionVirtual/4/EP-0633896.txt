<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention there is provided a composition as obtained from a melt comprising esterified starch, preferably having an amylose content of at least about 50 % by weight with respect to that of the starch, and being substituted to a degree of at least about 1.5. The starch ester may be of the kind obtained by reaction of a mixed acid anhydride with starch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to degradable polymer
compositions capable of being formed by heat and pressure
into articles having good dimensional stability and
physical properties.It is known that starch may be heated under pressure to
form a melt suitable for the production of shaped articles.
Such starch-based shaped articles may exhibit the
disadvantages of relatively poor physical properties under
high relative humidity conditions and a relatively high
tendency to embrittlement under relatively low humidity
conditions.Attempts to overcome these problems by the replacement of
the above mentioned starch by maize starch esters having a
low degree of substitution, as commonly found in the
starch industry, have generally been unsuccessful, often
resulting in weak, brittle, hydrophilic materials having a
poor balance of physical properties. It is an object of the
present invention to overcome, at least in part, the above
mentioned disadvantages. GB-A-964799 discloses a composition which flows under heat and pressure and which is
water soluble comprising a derivative of an amylaceous material, a plasticizer for the
derivative and water, said derivative being an ether, ester, mixed ether, mixed ester,
mixed ether-ester, or a mixture of two or more thereof. It is reported that the MS (moles
of etherifying agent per anhydroglucose unit) of the alkyl or acetyl derivatives should not
exceed an MS of 1.5; at MS of 2 there were water insoluble. Acetyls having MS of 0.3
to 1.5 are disclosed.Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Vol. 49 No. 8, 1957, pages 1247-1248 describes mixed aliphatic esters of
amylose which can be converted to films and moulded products. This reference strictly
deals with amylose triesters.WO 92/19675 concerns moisture-proof, thermoplastic, environmentally friendly,
thermoplastically produced products and cast films of processable starch materials
consisting of starchy fat acyl compounds obtainable form amylose-rich starches and
softeners. WO 92/19675 is prior art only according to Art. 54 (3) EPC. The reference
discloses starch acetates and in one aspect suggests to replace part of the acetic acid by
long chain acids. According to the present invention there is provided a composition as obtained from a
melt comprising esterified starch, plasticizer and optionally further additives which is
characterized in that the esterified starch has a degree of substitution of from 1.8 to 2.9,
the esterified starch comprising at least two members selected from the group consisting
of acetate,
