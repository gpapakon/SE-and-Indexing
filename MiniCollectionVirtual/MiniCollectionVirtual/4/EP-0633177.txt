<ABSTRACT>
A child transporter, such as a perambulator or 
pushchair, has a chassis (14) including a pair of parallel 

rails (30) on which a body (10) is supported. Each rail 
(30) carries a pair of spaced upwardly facing oblique 

abutment surfaces (44, 46) which are inclined in opposite 
directions. The body (10) carries four downwardly facing 

oblique abutment surfaces (54, 56) each positioned to abut 
against engage a respective one of said upwardly facing 

abutment surfaces (44, 46), and a respective catch is 
positioned to releasably couple the body (10) to a 

corresponding rail (30) at a location between the abutment 
surfaces thereon (44, 46).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a child transporter, 
such as a perambulator or pushchair, of the type having a 
body, a chassis and a latch mechanism for detachably 
securing the body to the chassis, the chassis including a 
pair of parallel rails on which the body is supported and 
the latch mechanism comprising two latch members on 
opposite sides of the body, each latch member being adapted 
to engage with a respective one of the parallel rails. EP-A-0514054 discloses a perambulator of this type 
in which a pair of latch members are provided on each side 
of the body and arranged to engage with the corresponding 
rail at spaced locations so as to ensure stability. Each 
pair of latch members is coupled to a common actuating 
handle on the corresponding side of the perambulator body. 
These handles can be used to support the perambulator body 
when it is being lifted off or on to the chassis, the latch 
members being held in their released position during such 
lifting operation. However the mechanism linking the 
handles to the latches is relatively complex. The present 
invention aims to provide a simpler latching mechanism 
which a user can hold in the released position while 
lifting the body from the chassis, and which retains the 
above mentioned stability. According to the invention, in a child transporter 
of the type described above, each rail carries a pair of 
spaced upwardly facing oblique abutment surfaces which are 
inclined in opposite directions, the body carries four 
downwardly facing oblique abutment surfaces each positioned 
to abut against a respective one of said upwardly facing 
abutment surfaces, and a respective latch member is 
positioned to releasably couple the body to a corresponding 
rail at a location between the abutment surfaces thereon. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a plan in 
accordance with the invention with the body secured to the  
 
chassis; Figure 2 is an elevational view of the latch 
mechanism on one side of the body with the latch plates in 
their engaged position; Figure 3 is a sectional view on the line 3 - 3 in 
Figure 2; Figures 4 and 5 are views corresponding to Figures 
1 and 2 but with the body removed from the chassis and the 
latch members in their released position; and Figure 6 is a sectional view on the line 6 - 6 in 
Figure 5. Referring to Figure 1, a perambulator has a body 
10 with a hood 12 supported on a chassis

<CLAIMS>
A child transporter having a body (10), a chassis 
(14) and a latch mechanism for detachably securing the body 

(10) to the chassis (14), the chassis (14) including a pair 
of parallel rails (30) on which the body (10) is supported 

and the latch mechanism comprising two latch members (66) 
on opposite sides of the body (10), each latch member (66) 

being adapted to engage with a respective one of the 
parallel rails (30), characterised in that each rail (30) 

carries a pair of spaced upwardly facing oblique abutment 
surfaces (44, 46) which are inclined in opposite 

directions, the body (10) carries four downwardly facing 
oblique abutment surfaces (54, 56) each positioned to abut 

against a respective one of said upwardly facing abutment 
surfaces (44, 46), and a respective latch member (66) is 

positioned to releasably couple the body (10) to a 
corresponding rail (30) at a location between the abutment 

surfaces thereon (44, 46). 
A child transporter according to claim 1, wherein 
each latch member comprises a catch (66) which is pivotally 

mounted on the body (10) and has a detent formation (72, 
74) for engagement with the corresponding rail (30). 
A child transporter according to claim 2, wherein 
the detent formation comprises a hook formation (72) shaped 

to engage with the bottom edge of the rail (30). 
A child transporter according to claim 2 or 3, 
wherein the detent formation comprises a projection (74) 

adapted to engage in a hole (76) on a side face of the rail 
(30). 
A child transporter according to claim 2, 3 or 4, 
wherein the catch (66) is biassed into its engaged position 

by a spring (68).
