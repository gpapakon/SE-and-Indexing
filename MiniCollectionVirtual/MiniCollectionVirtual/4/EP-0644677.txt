<ABSTRACT>
In a transmission system digital symbols a
k
 are applied 
to a transmitter (2) 

which comprises a low-pass filter (50) and an FM modulator (52). 
The output signal of 

the transmitter (2) is transmitted to the receiver (6) via the 
channel (4). After the 

received signal has been filtered by a bandpass filter (54) and 
subsequently demodulated 

by an FM demodulator (56), a demodulated signal is obtained. To 
suppress noise 

signals of which the power spectrum increases with frequency, a 
predetection filter (60) 

is present between the subtracter circuit (58) and the detector (62). 
To compensate for 

the intersymbol interference generated by the predetection filter (60), 
a second input of 

the subtracter circuit (58) is supplied with a scaled version of the 
symbol Ã¢
k-1
.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a transmission system which comprises a
transmitter for applying a signal representing digital symbols to a channel and comprises
a receiver for receiving an output signal from the channel, which receiver comprises
determining means for determining a detection signal from a combination of an
auxiliary signal derived from the input signal of the receiver and a feedback signal, a
detector for determining detected symbol values from the detection signal and feedback
means for determining the feedback signal from the detected symbol values.The invention likewise relates to a receiver for such a system.A system as defined in the opening paragraph is known from United
States Patent 4,864,590.Transmission systems of this type may be used, for example, for digital
symbol transfer through the public telephone network or for reconstituting digital
symbols coming from a magnetic tape or disc.When digital symbols are transmitted via a transmission medium or stored
on a recording medium respectively, the symbols to be transmitted or recorded are
converted to a signal representing the digital symbols. This generally happens in the
form of analog pulses which are successively applied to the transmission medium or
recording medium respectively, further to be referenced by the term of channel. On the
output of the channel analog pulses are present from which the value of the transmitted
symbols can be determined by means of a detector. The detector may comprise a simple
comparator, but it is likewise conceivable that the detector is arranged as an MLSE
(Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation) detector. An example of an MLSE detector
is a Viterbi detector.In addition to the (desired) analog pulses, there is nearly always an
(undesired) noise signal present on the output of the channel. Due to the presence of
this noise signal, the detector will occasionally make erroneous decisions about the
value of the transmitted symbols. The probability of erroneous decisions increases as the
power of the noise signal increases. Some channels have a larger bandwidth than is 
necessary for transmitting the analog pulses and, besides, have a spectral power density
of the noise signal that increases with frequency. The ratio of the actual bandwidth of
the channel and the bandwidth necessary for transmitting the analog pulses is referenced
the excess bandwidth. In such channels the signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal of
the channel is lower as the excess bandwidth is higher. With a high excess bandwidth
the
