<ABSTRACT>
An electronic equipment has a cooling structure in which air 
discharged from heat sinks (3) can be recovered without any 

leakage and compact blow ducts and discharge ducts are 
disposed in a narrow space. A supply opening (23) and a 

discharge opening (26) for cooling air are independently 
formed in a heat sink (3). A plurality of supply branched 

ducts (4) and discharge branched ducts (5) are combined in a 
comb-like shape along the axis of the ducts. Ejection 

openings (18) for cooling air are formed on each of the 
supply branched ducts (4) in the position corresponding to 

each of the heat sinks (3). Such ejection openings (18) are 
closely connected to the supply openings (23) for cooling air 

of the heat sinks (3). On the other hand, recovery openings 
(19) for cooling air are formed on each of the refrigerant 

discharge ducts (5) in a position corresponding to each of 
the heat sinks (3). Such recovery openings (19) are closely 

connected to the discharge openings (26) for gas refrigerant 
of the heat sinks (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic equipment comprising a plurality
of substrate plates disposed substantially in parallel to each other, a plurality of
heat-emitting semiconductor parts mounted in rows of a matrix scheme on one or
both side surfaces of each of said substrate plates, a plurality of heat sinks attached
in thermal contact to said semiconductor parts, a plurality of refrigerant supply
ducts having a plurality of ejection openings for blowing separate refrigerant gas
streams to each of said heat sinks, a plurality of refrigerant discharge means for
discharging the gas refrigerant after cooling the heat sinks, said discharge means
are alternately arranged and in parallel side by side to said supply ducts and in parallel to the rows of semiconductor parts.Such an electronic equipment is disclosed in JP-A-4162497 which
describes a jet cooling device with a small fan in which an air supplying duct is
formed in a serious of U-shapes or in a shape of teeth of a comb. At the tooth-shaped
part, a plurality of small holes are provided through which a cooling fluid is
introduced into channels in which substrates with a plurality of IC chips and LSI
packages are disposed.EP 0 445 309 A1 describes a high performance fluid heat exchanger
for cooling an electronic component which includes housing having a base, a plurality
of parallel fins in the housing and a center fed inlet connected to the housing
opposite the base for supplying cooling fluid towards the base and towards the ends
of the fins. A plate is positioned between the tops and bottom of the fins and extends
generally parallel to the base and extends towards, but is spaced from, the
ends of the fins for providing a double cooling pass against the fins.Conventionally, the following system is often employed in an electronic
equipment as a means of cooling a plurality of heat-emitting semiconductor
parts mounted on a circuit substrate such as a printed substrate, a ceramic substrate,
or the like. A fin is mounted on each of the heat-emitting semiconductor parts,
thereby supplying cooling air to the sides of the semiconductor parts which are
then sequentially cooled. However, since the amount of heat emitted from the
semiconductor parts continues to significantly increase, the above system presents
a new problem in that the air temperature thus soars, and accordingly, in the position
of the equipment at the downstream of the air, the more the cooling performance
deteriorates. Thus, in order to solve the above problem, the following method
has
