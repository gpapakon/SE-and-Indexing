<ABSTRACT>
Numerous defibrillator output circuits need controls which are electrically isolated by at least one electronic switch. The invention describes circuits for optically coupling the control signal to an isolated electronic switch. Variants of the invention comprise coupling by phototransistors or photodiodes. The invention describes a configuration for generating multiphase shocks (electroshocks) with a single capacitor, using an H bridge with four switches 13, 14, 19, 20, for connecting an energy storage capacitor 4 to a load 5, with a selectable polarity, and using the optical coupling methods of the invention for controlling the switches 13, 19 located on the upper side of the H bridge.
