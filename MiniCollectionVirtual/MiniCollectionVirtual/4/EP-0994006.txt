<ABSTRACT>
The front body panel is made from a pressed metal reinforcing member (2) and a molded plastic support (12) fitted into its cavity (5) and fixed by clips, engagement of matching surfaces, rivets, staples or bolts, or by ultrasound welding. Functional components of the vehicle can be fitted to the reinforcing member or support before they are assembled.

Method of manufacturing a front end for an automotive vehicle,
wherein a framework (2) is formed by pressing a metal plate, a plastics

material part (12) is moulded to form an operational support, and said
framework and said part are assembled by introducing said part (12) into

a reception chamber (5), which is defined by said framework (2), and by
a mechanical securement (14, 50, 51) or by ultrasound welding,


characterised in that
, when said framework (2) is assembled with said
plastics material part (12), a hollow body is formed with these two

components.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 it comprises
assembling said framework (2) and said support-forming part (12) by

clipping, form-fitting, riveting, jointing, snapping, stapling or bolting.
Method according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 it
comprises fitting said framework (2) and/or said support-forming part

(12) with operational components (20 - 25, 30, 70) of the vehicle prior to
assembling said framework and said support-forming part.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 it
comprises moulding said part (12), which forms the operational support

(12), by injection or by compression of polyester resin.
Front end (1) of an automotive vehicle, which comprises a metal
framework (2) of concave configuration and defines a housing (5) for 

accommodating one portion at least of a moulded plastics material part
(12), which forms an operational support and is assembled with said

framework by a mechanical securement or by ultrasound welding,

characterised in that
 said framework (2) and said part (12) together form
a hollow body.
Front end according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 said support-forming
part (12) and/or said framework (2) are/is provided with means

(6, 15, 16) for securing and/or for supporting operational components (20
- 25, 30, 70) of the vehicle.
Front end according to one of claims 5 or 6, 
characterised in that

the assembly between said framework (2) and said support-forming part
(12) is detachable.
Front end according to one of claims 5 to 7, 
characterised in that

the concavity of said framework (2) is orientated towards the engine
compartment of the vehicle.
Front end according to one of claims 5 to 8, 
characterised in that
 it
comprises a covering (60), which is mounted on said framework (2)

and/or said support-forming part (12), said covering forming an anti-recycling
partition (62) for the air from the engine compartment of the

vehicle.
Front end according to one of claims 5 to 9, 
characterised in that

said support-forming part (12) and/or said covering (60) are/is
specifically adapted to the type of the vehicle and to its equipment, while 

said framework (2) is compatible with various types of vehicles or with
vehicles with different levels of equipment.
