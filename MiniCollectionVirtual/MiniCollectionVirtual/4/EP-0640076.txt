<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of 1-aryl-1,2,4-triazolin-5-ones 
in a medium of tert-butanol. United States Patent 4,980,480 discloses a process 
for producing 1-aryl-1,2,4-triazolin-5-ones by treating 
an aryl triazolidinone with a hypohalous acid, a salt 
thereof, or a halogen. The triazolidinone may be 
produced by reacting an appropriate aryl hydrazine with 
an aldehyde to give the corresponding hydrazone 
followed by treatment with an alkali metal cyanate to 
give the triazolidinone. A medium is preferred in 
which the triazolidinone is at least partially soluble. 
Acetic acid is said to be a very suitable medium. In accordance with one aspect of applicant's 
invention, a 1-aryl-1,2,4-triazolidin-5-one is treated 
in a medium of tert-butanol with a hypohalous acid, a 
salt thereof, or a halogen to form the corresponding 
triazolinone. The reaction proceeds rapidly at 
relatively low temperatures to give high yields in 
short reaction times. In another aspect of the invention, the triazolidinone 
may be produced in high yields in a medium 
of tert-butanol by reacting an aryl hydrazone with an 
alkali metal cyanate. The aryl hydrazone may in turn 
be produced by the reaction of an aryl hydrazine with 
an aldehyde in a tert-butanol medium. The tert-butanol medium may be anhydrous tert-butanol 
or preferably a mixture of tert-butanol and 
water. By using a tert-butanol medium, high yields of 
triazolinone may be obtained. Of particular advantage, 
both high yields and high purity of triazolinone 
product may be obtained in large scale production (for 
example with 2 lb-mole (907 moles) of the aryl 
hydrazine starting material using a 500 gallon (1893  
 
liter) reactor). Starting with the aryl hydrazine or 
aryl hydrazone, sequential steps of the process may be 
conducted in a single reactor by sequentially adding 
the reactants without the need to isolate or purify the 
intermediate products. Without further purification, 
other than water washing, the large scale as well as 
bench scale triazolinone product may be isolated and 
used directly in subsequent reactions such as 
difluoromethylation of the N-4 nitrogen of the 
triazolinone ring, or chlorination of the benzene ring. 
Prior to the present process, the medium of choice was 
acetic acid/water (U.S. 4,980,480). In the development 
of large scale production procedures using an acetic 
acid/water medium, product results were found to be 
variable. Triazolinone yields and purity were 
considerably lower than could be obtained at bench 
sc
