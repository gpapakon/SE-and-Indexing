<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device is provided which makes a high 
withstand voltage bipolar transistor small and prevents 

deterioration in a switching speed of the transistor. A 
silicon oxide layer is formed on a silicon substrate, and a 

semiconductor island of one conductivity type which is 
isolated laterally by an
 isolation trench is formed on the 
silicon oxide layer. A silicon oxide film is formed on an 

outer periphery portion of the semiconductor island to bury 
the trench. In the semiconductor island, a bipolar 

transistor, namely a base region of the other conductivity 
type is formed, and in the base region an emitter region of 

one conductivity type is formed and a collector region of one 
conductivity type is further formed. And in the semiconductor 

island a diffusion region of the other conductivity type for 
extracting excessive carriers to which an electric potential 

of constant is applied is further formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric isolated bipolar transistor.In a bipolar integrated circuit integrating bipolar
transistors, it is important to electrically isolate the
elements to each other. As the isolation method, it is in
general to use PN junctions. In case of for instance an NPN
type bipolar transistor, an N type epitaxial layer formed on
a P type substrate is partitioned by a P type diffusion layer
to construct an island of a number of N type regions isolated
to each other by PN junctions and to form a bipolar
transistor in the N type island. And for providing electrical
isolation between the elements and between the elements and
the substrate by this structure, the PN junctions formed
between them are maintained in their reverse bias conditions.
However, for preventing lowering of a withstand voltage, there
is a problem that a plane size of the bipolar transistor may
not be made small. Namely, to make the element size small,
it is necessary to shorten a distance from a diffusion region 
of an element to an isolation region, namely a P type
isolation region. However, there is a probrem that the
withstand voltage lowers when the distance to the isolation
region is shortened, as shown in Fig. 28.Therefore, a dielectric isolation method for isolating
elements by insulating material such as a silicon oxide film
or the like is known. This is a method in which an N type
silicon layer is disposed on an insulation layer, the
identical N type silicon layer is partitioned to form a
plurality of N type silicon islands, an insulation film such
as a silicon oxide film or the like is formed around the N
type silicon island, and a circuit element is formed in the
N type silicon island. With this method, as shown in Fig. 28,
it is possible to maintain a high withstand voltage even if
the distance to the isolation region is made small. In other
words, it is possible to maintain the withstand voltage and
also to make the element size small.However, in the bipolar integrated circuit given by
this dielectric isolation method it has been apparent that a
switching time of the bipolar transistor has become slow. From document Patent Abstracts of Japan 15 (308), (E-1097)
corresponding to JP-A-03 110852 and International
Electron Devices Meeting, San Francisco, no. 1988, pages
870-872, a semiconductor device according to the preamble
of claim 1 is known. When the element size of such a
semiconductor device is to be made small while maintaining
the withstand voltage the switching time of the device will
beco
