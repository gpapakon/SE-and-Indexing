<ABSTRACT>
[Constituent] A fluorine-containing indolebutyric acid 

type agent for increasing sugar content and/or decreasing 
the acid content of fruits, including at least one group, 

as an effective component, which is selected from 
fluorine-containing indolebutyric acids represented by the 

general formula: 

(in which Y represents a hydroxyl group, alkoxy group, 
amino group or alkyl amino group, and R¹ and R² 

independently represent a hydrogen atom, halogen atom, 
alkyl group, alkoxy group, aryl group, nitro group, amino 

group or alkyl amino group.) 
[Effect]
The fluorine-containing indolebutyric acid type 
agent for increasing the sugar content and/or decreasing 

the acid content in a fruit according to the present 
invention is a novel compound that has an ability, 

particularly with respect to citrus and vitis fruits, to 
markedly icnrease sugar content and/or decrease acid 

content and has ability to promote sweetness and 
coloration of such fruits to be harvested.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of an agent for
increasing the sugar content and/or decreasing the acid
content in plant fruits, which agent has a fluorine-containing
β-indolebutyric acid compound as a substantial
main component thereof, and to a method for obtaining ripe
fruits having a high sugar content and/or a low acid
content by causing the fluorine-containing β-indolebutyric
acid compound to adhere to unripe fruits, to the
environment of plants bearing fruits, or to plants in
their entirety, and subsequently allowing the fruits to
mature.The most important requirement for fruits used
for luxury consumption in the form of their fresh meats or
their extracted juices is abundant sweetness. The
sweetness of a fruit is more strongly perceived when the
sugar content determined as a physical quantity is large
and the acid content similarly determined is small, and
the sweetness of a fruit is generally perceived with
significant difference when the sugar-acid ratio of the
fruit calculated as the ratio of the sugar content to the
acid content is higher than that of the compared fruit by
one unit.It is a common practice to treat plants bearing 
fruits with an agent for decreasing their acid content or
an agent for increasing their sugar content for the
purpose of imparting increased sweetness to the harvested
fruits. Ethyl Kurozeto [sodium 5-chloro-1H-indazol-3-ylacetate
or ethyl 5-chloro-1H-indazol-3-ylacetate] has
been recognized to be more or less effective as an agent
for increasing the sugar content and promoting the
coloration of citrus fruits. Among the agents for
decreasing the acid content of citrus fruits, lead
arsenate is the first to have been registered as an
agricultural chemical compound in Japan. It was
extensively utilized as an agent for decreasing the acid
content of citrus fruits for many years.Chronic lead arsenate poisoning is, however,
known to have caused lung cancer, skin cancer, etc. in
large numbers of workers engaged in spraying the agent.
In addition, consumers of treated citrus fruits are in
danger of suffering oral acute poisoning owing to the lead
arsenate remaining on the citrus fruit skin. In 1978, the
registration of lead arsenate as an agricultural chemical
was canceled in Japan. It is believed that the effect of
lead arsenate in decreasing the acid content of citrus
fruits arises because this compound disturbs the TCA cycle
of not only the fruits but also the whole plant and
degrades the level of biosynthesis of citric acid in the
plants. The directions attached to
