<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to flight control 
systems for rotary wing aircraft and more 
particularly to an integrated fire and flight control 
system which provides automatic turn coordination 
during control of aircraft azimuth and pitch based on 
a fire control system targeting solution. The combat uses for helicopter aircraft have 
changed dramatically over the years to include 
contact with opposing forces, including 
reconnaissance and combat aircraft assistance of 
troops on the front line. This type of use subjects 
helicopters to numerous threats, and therefore new 
helicopter designs incorporate offensive weapons, 
such as Gatling guns and rocket launchers. Initially, the primary controi of helicopter 
weapons was accomplished by the pilot aiming the 
aircraft at the target prior to firing. Correction 
for misses was accomplished by the pilot adjusting 
the attitude of the aircraft prior to expending 
additional ordnance. As technology developed, 
tracking and sensing systems were used to locate the 
target and determine the aircraft attitude necessary  
 
to aim the weapon so as to account for outside forces 
acting on the ordnance, e.g., wind, aircraft speed, 
etc. Such a system typically displays a "cross-hair" 
indicative of actual aircraft attitude and a 
geometric shape indicative of the required aircraft 
attitude to provide a high probability of striking 
the target with the weapon. The pilot is required to 
maneuver the aircraft so as to place the cross-hair 
in the firing solution defined by the shape prior to 
firing the weapon. The aiming instructions e.g., 
cross-hair and geometric shape, are typically 
displayed on a control panel, a heads-up display, or 
helmet-mounted display which provides the pilot with 
visual information relating to the target position, 
ownship attitude, heading, speed and altitude. Although such aiming systems improved weapons 
delivery accuracy, the pilot is still under a 
significant burden to regulate aircraft heading and 
pitch attitude. It is well-known that a skilled 
helicopter pilot can control aircraft attitude within 
about 1 degree of pitch and yaw. Although this may 
seem very accurate control, a 1 degree variation in 
pitch or yaw will have a significant effect on the 
trajectory of a projectile. When the pilot is maneuvering the aircraft for 
targeting, the aircraft automatic flight control 
system (AFCS) will typically provide control signals 
such that the aircraft executes coordinated turns. A
