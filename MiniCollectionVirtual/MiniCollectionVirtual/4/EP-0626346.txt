<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for capturing ecologically 
harmful substances, both of organic and inorganic nature, 

by absorbing these substances on a zeolite or on a 
swellable, layered clay which has been modified with 

hydroxyaluminium to form an aluminium-rich zeolite or a 
pillared clay containing pillars of aluminium hydroxide 

complexes, said aluminium-rich zeolite or aluminium-pillared 
cationic or anionic clay having been treated, 

prior to the absorption, with a salt of an inorganic acid, 
preferably with a phosphate. If the treatment is carried 

out with a salt of a rare earth element, superpillars are 
formed in the clay, as a result of which a clay having a 

great absorbency in addition to a large rate of flow is 
obtained. By treating the pillared clay with a quaternary 

ammonium compound, a doubly modified clay is formed which 
is exceedingly suitable for treating material which has 

been polluted with a combination of organic and inorganic 
ecologically harmful substances, and in particular polluted 

with heavy metals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for capturing 
ecologically harmful organic and inorganic substances from 
a material polluted with such substances, by absorbing said 
substances on a zeolite or on a swellable, layered clay, 
which are modified with hydroxyaluminium to form an 
aluminium-rich zeolite or a pillared clay having pillars of 
aluminium hydroxide complexes. Such a method is disclosed by US 4.740.488. It 
should be noted, however, that the aluminium-pillared clay 
formed in this known method, in particular aluminium-pillared 
cationic clay, is used as an absorbent to remove 
only traces of organic pollutants from industrial 
effluents. A method has now been found, by virtue of which 
such an aluminium-rich zeolite or an aluminium-pillared 
cationic or anionic clay is suitable for absorption of 
organic and inorganic compounds, and in particular for 
heavy metals such as chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, 
silver, cadmium, mercury and lead. The method according to the invention is characterised 
in that, prior to the absorption of the organic and 
inorganic substances, the aluminium-rich zeolite or the 
aluminium-pillared, cationic or anionic clay is treated 
with a salt of an inorganic acid. This treatment can be 
carried out in a simple manner, specifically by flushing 
the aluminium-rich zeolite or the aluminium-pillared clay 
with an aqueous solution of the desired salt. This results 
in the aluminium of the zeolites or the aluminium of the 
clay structures and the aluminium pillars between the clay 
layers being coated, as it were, with a layer of the acid 
groups of the salt employed. A beneficial side effect of 
this treatment was observed in that porous aluminium-rich 
zeolite, but in particular the treated aluminium-pillared 
clay having a large spacing of approximately 10 Ã… between 
the clay layers, has many active acid groups, while the 
free pores in the structures remain virtually unchanged. As  
 
a result, a high rate of flow is possible if, for example, 
heavy metals have to be absorbed from an industrial 
effluent stream. Incidentally, the zeolite material treated 
according to the invention, and the processed and modified 
clay material is not restricted to absorbing and fixing 
materials in trace quantities; effluents containing larger 
amounts of pollutants can likewise be treated expediently. The salt used of an inorganic acid is preferably a 
sulphate, sulphite, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, phosphite, 
carbonate, chlorate and/or chloride. It was found that if a 
phosphate
