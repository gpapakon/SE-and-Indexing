<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and a device for squaring and for flash-butt-welding the leading and trailing ends of metal sheets (strips) in a combined machine comprising a welder and a shear cutter. According to the process of the invention, the ends of an incoming sheet (18'') and outgoing sheet (18') are held, after they have been centred and aligned, by means of auxiliary holding devices (4, 4') that are then kept in use, the space between the pairs of jaws (3, 3') of the welder is adjusted before inserting the shear cutter (2) into this space, the jaws (5, 6, 5', 6') of the welder being open, the shear cutter is centred with respect to this space and inserted into it by bringing the counter-blades (12, 12') between the open jaws (5, 6, 5', 6') of the welder, the jaws (5, 6, 5', 6') of the welder are clamped tight and the shear cutter (2) is actuated, the jaws (5, 6, 5', 6') of the welder are slackened and the shear cutter (2) removed, the jaws (5, 6, 5', 6') of the welder are tightened up again before moving the pairs of jaws (3, 3') closer to each other and flash welding the ends of the incoming and outgoing metal sheets.   The invention is particularly intended to be used for ensuring continuity of a line making flat products in the iron and steel industry.

a welder (1) and shears (2), comprising the steps of: 

providing a space between the pairs of jaws (3, 3') of 
the welder located respectively towards the end of an 

out-going strip (18') and towards the end of an in-going 
strip (18''), 
aligning and centering both ends of metal strips (18', 
18'') in the space between the jaws, 
holding the aligned and centered strip ends with 
auxiliary clamps (4, 4'), 
centering the shears in the space between the pairs of 
jaws (3, 3') of the welder, 
inserting the shears (2) in the space between the 
pairs of jaws (3, 3') of the welder, 
activating the shears (2) appropriately centered in 
this space to simultaneously cut and square the ends 

of the in-going and out-going strips and collecting 
the cut ends (22, 22') in the shears, 
removing the shears (2), with the cut ends, from the 
space provided between the pairs of jaws (3, 3') of 

the welder,

3') together into the welding position, and 
flash butt welding the ends of the in-coming and out-going

jaws (5, 6, 5', 6') of the welder, 
tightening the jaws (5, 6, 5', 6') of the welder while 
keeping the strips with the auxiliary clamps (4, 4') 

in service and activating the shears (2), 
loosening the jaws (5, 6, 5', 6') of the welder while 
keeping the strips with the auxiliary clamps in 

service and removing the shears (2), 
re-tightening the jaws (5, 6, 5', 6') of the welder 
before bringing the pairs of jaws (3, 3') close 

together and flash-butt seam welding the ends of the 
in-going and the out-going metal strips. 
The process according to claim 1, characterized by 
scraping the side of the upper (7, 7') and lower (8, 8') 

electrodes directed towards the space (
a

pairs of jaws (3, 3') of the welder, in the course of 

insertion and/or removal of the shears in and from this 
space. 
The process according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
by adjusting the electrode scraping devices (21, 21') to
