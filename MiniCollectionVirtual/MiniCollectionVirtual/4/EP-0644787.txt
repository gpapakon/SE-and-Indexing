<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pressure breathing masks such 
as the oxygen masks used by military aircrew. It is well known that human life relies on the absorption of 
oxygen by the lungs. For absorption to take place the partial 
pressure of oxygen in the lungs must be above a certain minimum 
pressure. It is also well known that one effect of increasing altitude is 
a reduction in air density (and hence in air pressure). To compensate 
for this effect aircrew are provided, through specially designed 
masks, known as oxygen masks, with an air supply having an enhanced, 
eventually pure, oxygen content. However an altitude, normally about 
37,000 feet, is eventually reached where the pressure of even pure 
oxygen is insufficient for it to be absorbed. To overcome this 
problem aircraft cabins are pressurised. The effect of loss of pressure in the cabin of an aircraft 
flying above the critical altitude is that occupants of the cabin 
rapidly become hypoxic (from lack of oxygen) and the consequent loss 
of consciousness can occur very quickly. To cope with this 
eventuality systems have been developed whereby loss of cabin pressure 
results in the supply to oxygen masks of pure oxygen at increased 
pressure relative to ambient pressure, sufficient for it to be 
absorbed by the lungs in an amount sufficient to prevent hypoxia. For 
this pressurised breathing to be effective an oxygen mask must clearly 
form a gas tight seal with its wearer's face. Masks held in position 
sufficiently tightly to fulfil this condition would be unbearably 
uncomfortable at this tightness, so masks have been developed which 
can be tightened when the wearer notices the onset of pressure 
breathing. Currently used masks each have a rigid exoskeleton, 
normally of a Fibre (usually glass fibre) Reinforced Plastic Material, 
to which is attached a flexible face piece. It is, of course, 
essential that the face-piece be flexible to allow it to remain in  
 
sealing contact with a wearer's face despite the inevitable changes in 
contour of the face (due, for example, to the effects of talking and 
to the effects of gravitational forces during manoeuvring of the 
aircraft). The exoskeleton is attached to a helmet by a mechanism 
which can be tightened to bring the facepiece into tighter contact 
with a wearer's face. The conventional arrangement includes a toggle 
bar which the wearer moves physically with his fingers. Over recent years, pressure breathing has been introduced to 
help counter the effects of acceleration, in

<CLAIMS>
A pressure breathing mask including a rigid exoskeleton (10), 
means (16, 17) for attaching the exoskeleton to a helmet, a flexible 

facepiece (11) with a gas delivery connection (21), inflatable means 
(20) positioned between the exoskeleton (10) and the facepiece (11), 

and means (21, 23) for automatically inflating the inflatable means 
(20) when gas is delivered under pressure to the facepiece (11), 

characterised in that a rigid intermediate member (30) conforming to 
the general configuration of the flexible facepiece (11) and bearing 

against the facepiece (11) is used to convey the effects of inflating 
the inflatable means (20) to the facepiece (11). 
A pressure breathing mask as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in 
that the inflatable means is a bladder (20). 
A pressure breathing mask as claimed in Claim 1 or in Claim 2 
characterised in that the means for automatically inflating the 

inflatable means (20) comprise a connection to a gas delivery system. 
A pressure breathing mask as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the exoskeleton (10) is attached to the helmet 

by means of a chain (16). 
A pressure breathing mask as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the exoskeleton (10) is attached to the helmet 

by means including a toggle arrangement (17). 
A pressure breathing mask as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that it is an aircrew oxygen mask. 
A pressure breathing mask as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that the means (16, 17) for attaching the exoskeleton 

(10) to a helmet are such as to make the mask integral with the 
helmet.
