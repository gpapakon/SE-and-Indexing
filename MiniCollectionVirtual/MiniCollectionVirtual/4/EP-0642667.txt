<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an early, biochemical indication of increased risk of impending preterm delivery. The method comprises obtaining a cervicovaginal secretion sample from a pregnant patient after week 12 of gestation and determining the level of a local inflammatory product protein or an extracellular matrix protein in the sample. The presence of an elevated level of the selected protein in the sample indicates an increased risk of delivery. The test is a screening assay that can detect women at risk of imminent delivery, as early as two to three weeks prior to delivery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for detection of
impending preterm delivery. In particular, this invention
is directed to the determination of impending delivery by
detecting an increased level of a local inflammatory
product protein or a matrix protein in a cervicovaginal
secretion sample.Determination of impending preterm births is critical
for increasing neonatal survival of preterm infants. In
particular, preterm neonates account for more than half,
and maybe as much as three-quarters of the morbidity and
mortality of newborns without congenital anomalies.
Although tocolytic agents which can delay delivery were
introduced 20 to 30 years ago, there has been only a minor
decrease in the incidence of preterm delivery. It has
been postulated that the failure to observe a larger
reduction in the incidence of preterm births is due to
errors in the diagnosis of preterm labor and to the
patients' conditions being too advanced for tocolytic
agents to successfully delay the birth.Traditional methods of diagnosis of preterm labor
have high false-negative and false-positive error rates
[Friedman et al, Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.104:544 (1969)].
In addition, traditional methods for determining impending
preterm delivery, particularly in patients with clinically
intact membranes, may require subjective interpretation,
may require sophisticated training or equipment [Garl et 
al, Obstet. Gynecol. 60:297 (1982)] or may be invasive
[Atlay et al, Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 108:933 (1970)]. An
early, objective biochemical marker which indicated
increased risk for preterm delivery was sought.Recently, Lockwood et al [New Engl. J. Med.,325:669-674
(1991)] reported that fetal fibronectin in cervical
and vaginal secretions indicates pregnancies which are at
risk of imminent delivery. The authors postulate that
damage to the fetal membranes may release fetal
fibronectin into the cervix and vagina, giving rise to the
biochemical marker.Other markers which may be released in women with
true threatened pregnancies can be used to screen those
women who should be closely monitored and to provide
additional information about the stage of the disease.The present invention provides an early, biochemical
indication of increased risk of impending preterm
delivery. The method comprises obtaining a cervicovaginal
secretion sample from a pregnant patient after about week
12 of gestation and determining the level of a local
inflammatory product protein or a matrix protein in the
sample. The presence of an elevated level of the selected
prote

<CLAIMS>
A method for determining impending delivery
comprising determining the level of a protein selected

from interleukin six (IL-6) or total fibronectin in a
secretion sample obtained from the vaginal cavity or

the cervical canal of a pregnant patient after week 12
of pregnancy, the presence of an elevated level of

said protein in the sample indicating an increased
risk of impending delivery.
The method of claim 1 wherein the sample is

obtained from the posterior fornix.
The method of claim 1 wherein the sample is
obtained from the cervical os.
The method of claim 1 wherein the sample
obtained from the patient does not have an elevated

level of the protein and another sample from the
patient is assayed for the protein at least two weeks

later.
The method of claim 4 wherein a sample from
the patient is obtained and assayed for the presence

of the protein at intervals of about 2 to about 4
weeks until the patient delivers or a positive sample

is obtained.
The method of claim 1 wherein if the sample
has an elevated level of IL-6 or total fibronectin,

cervical or vaginal secretions of said patient are
tested for the presence of fetal fibronectin.
The method of claim 6 wherein if the test for 
fetal fibronectin is negative another test for the

presence of fetal fibronectin in the cervical or
vaginal secretions of said patient is carried out at

least one week later.
The method of claim 6 wherein if the test for
fetal fibronectin is negative further tests for the

presence of fetal fibronectin in the cervical or
vaginal secretions of said patient are carried out at

two week intervals until the patient delivers or a
positive fetal fibronectin sample is obtained.
The method of claim 1 comprising the steps of

(a) contacting the sample with an antibody
specific for the protein for a time

sufficient for antigen-antibody binding; and
(b) determining the amount of binding.
