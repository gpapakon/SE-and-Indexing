<ABSTRACT>
With the weapon system being displaced with respect to the target designation system (1), the relative position of the two systems (1, 11) is determined from a target direction (10) supplied by the target designation system (1), a set (33) of possible positions of the target (31) is determined in a reference frame related to the weapon system (11) as well as the firing directions (30, 30A) passing through these possible positions (33) and the weapon system (11), and the weapon system (11) scans these firing directions (30, 30A).

Method for operating a weapon system (11) associated with
a target designation system (1) with a passive detector,

characterised by the fact that one displaces the weapon system
with respect to the target designation system (1), one determines

the relative position of the two systems (1, 11), from the latter
and from a target direction (10) supplied by the target

designation system (1), one determines a set (33) of possible
positions of the target (31) in a reference linked to the weapon

system (11) as well as the firing directions (30, 30A) passing
through these possible positions (33) and the weapon system (11),

and the weapon system (11) scans these firing directions (30,
30A).
Method according to Claim 1, in which the weapon system
(11) proceeds with scanning in a plane (10, 33) containing said

target direction (10).
Method according to one of Claims 1 and 2, in which, in
order to limit the scanning of the weapon system (11), one

restricts the set of possible target positions (33) by estimating
the distance (D) between the target (31) and the passive detector

(1, 2).
Method according to Claim 3, in which one estimates the
distance (D) of the target (31) from the detector (1, 2) by

measuring the amplitude of the detection signal from the detector
(2).
Combination, for carrying out the method of Claim 1, of
a weapon system (11) and an associated target designation system

(1), which comprises a passive detector (2) and means (4) for the
determination of the target direction (10), characterised by the

fact that the weapon system (11) is displaced with respect to the
target designation system (1) and is connected thereto (20) and

there are provided means (13) for the determination of the 
relative position of the two systems (1, 11) and means

(12) for the determination of the firing direction (30, 30A)
controlled by the detector (2) and arranged to control firing as

a function of the target direction (10) and of the relative
position (13) of the two systems (1, 11).
Combination according to Claim 5, in which the weapon
system (11) comprises means (12) for the determination of the

firing direction (30, 30A).
Combination according to one of Claims 5 and 6, in which
the means for the determination of the firing direction (30, 30A)

comprise calculation means (12) connected to the detector (2) and
arranged in ord
er to estimate a distance (D) of the target (31)
from the detector (2) and in order to control the firing as a

consequence.
Combination according to one of Claims 5 to 7, in which
means are provided for the visualisation of the target direction

(10) on a ring (9) of a display screen (8).
Combination according to Claim 8, in which the
visualisation means are arranged in order to display, on the

screen (8), the position of the target designation system (1),
the position of at least one weapon system (11) and of its area

of action, an estimated trajectory (42) of the target (31) as
well as its estimated speed (43) and possibly characteristic

points of the countryside.
