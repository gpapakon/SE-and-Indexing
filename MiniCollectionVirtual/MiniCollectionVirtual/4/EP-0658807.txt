<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a positive-working 
photoresist composition comprising an alkali-soluble resin and 
a specific 1,2-quinonediazide compound which is sensitive to 
radiations such as ultraviolet ray, far ultraviolet ray, X ray, 
electron ray, molecular beam, γ-ray and synchrotron radiation. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a positive-working 
photoresist for fine work which provides a high 
resolving power against the fluctuations in the film thickness, 
gives little development residue and exhibits an excellent 
development latitude and a high age stability. The positive-working photoresist of the present 
invention is generally applied to a substrate such as 
semiconductor wafer, glass, ceramics and metal to a thickness 
of 0.5 to 2 µm by spin coating method or roller coating method. 
Thereafter, the material is heated to dryness, irradiated with 
an ultraviolet ray etc. through an exposure mask to print a 
circuit pattern thereon, and then developed, optionally after 
baking, to form a positive image thereon. With this positive image as a mask, the substrate is 
then etched to effect patternwise work thereon. This technique 
finds typical applications in the production of semiconductors 
such as IC, the production of circuit boards such as a liquid 
crystal and thermal head, the production of a magnetic bubble 
memory device, and other photofabrication processes, etc.  
 As a positive-working photoresist composition there is 
normally used a composition comprising an alkali-soluble resin 
binder such as novolak and a naphthoquinonediazide compound as 
a photosensitive material. A novolak resin which serves as a binder can be 
dissolved in an alkaline aqueous solution without swelling. 
The novolak resin can also exhibit a high resistance 
particularly to plasma etching when an image thus produced is 
used as a mask for etching. Thus, novolak resin is 
particularly useful in this application. A naphthoquinone 
diazide compound which serves as a photosensitive material 
itself serves as a dissolution inhibitor for reducing the 
alkali solubility of novolak resin but is peculiar in that it 
undergoes decomposition upon the irradiation with light to 
produce an alkali-soluble substance which rather enhances the 
alkali solubility of novolak resin. Because of the great 
change in properties by the irradiation with light, 
naphthoquinone diazide compound is particularly useful as 
photosensitive material for positive-working photoresist. From such a standpoint of view,
