<ABSTRACT>
A complex between a virus the cell binding receptor of which has been inactivated and an antibody, said antibody having the ability to interact with a specific antigen on the surface of a mammalian cell different from the cellular structure which would otherwise mediate binding of the virus to the cell surface and which antigen has the ability to mediate entrance of a virus vector or infectious virus into mammalian cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a complex between a
virus the cell binding receptor of which has been inactivated
and an antibody. The invention is applicable to situations
where it is desireable to introduce viruses into
selected mammalian cells for medicinal purposes.Viruses enter mammalian cells following binding between
a viral receptor and a chemical structure, or ligand,
in the cell membrane. This initial binding is a
first and necessary step leading to the entry of virus
into the cell and the subsequent transcription of the
viral genome and replication of the virus within the cell.
Rather detailed knowledge about the structure and specificity
of many viral receptors is at hand. For example, in
the case of influenza virus the specificity of the virus
receptor is analogous to the specificity of antibodies
against certain tumor antigens, in that the influenza
virus hemagglutinin binds to NeuAc2-3Gal-R, which is present
on the same structures as many human tumor associated
antigens.The main object of the present invention is to provide
techniques enabling introduction of viruses into mammalian
cells for providing desired biological action in
such cells.Another object of the invention is to enable virus
vectors or infectious viruses to be directed to specific
cells in a living animal body.Yet another purpose is to provide techniques making
it possible for viruses to selectively enter specific
cells in a living animal body.For these and other purposes the invention provides
for a complex between a virus and an antigen-binding
substance selected from antibodies, fragments of antibodies
and antigen-binding peptides, the cell binding
receptor of said virus being inactivated. Said substance 
has the ability to interact with a specific antigen on the
surface of a mammalian cell which antigen is different
from the cellular structure which would otherwise mediate
binding of the virus to the cell surface. Furthermore,
said substance has the ability to mediate entrance of a
virus vector or infectious virus into the cell.The substance can either be a monoclonal antibody or
a fragment of a whole antibody.The substance can be bound to the virus in different
ways, such as by chemical conjugation, by bridging the
substance to the virus by an immunochemical reagent, or by
using a bifunctional substance binding to the virus as
well as to a cellular antigen.The substance may also be expressed on the virus surface
envelope following cloning into the virus genome of
gene(s) for whole antibodies or fragments thereof.The
