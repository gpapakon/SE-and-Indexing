<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to sulfur-containing aromatic compounds 
which are useful in inhibiting cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase or tumor necrosis 
factor. The invention is also directed to the preparation of these compounds, 
pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and methods for 
their pharmaceutical use. α-TNF is an important pro-inflammatory glycoprotein cytokine which 
causes hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors and possesses other important 
biological activities. α-TNF Is released by activated macrophages, activated 
T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, mast cells and basophils, fibroblasts, 
endothelial cells and brain astrocytes among other cells. The principal in vivo actions of α-TNF can be broadly classified as 
inflammatory and catabolic. It has been implicated as a mediator of endotoxic 
shock, inflammation of joints and of the airways, immune deficiency states, 
allograft rejection, and in the cachexia associated with malignant disease and 
some parasitic infections. In view of the association of high serum levels of α-TNF 
with poor prognosis in sepsis, graft versus host disease and acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, and its role in many other immunologic 
processes, this factor is regarded as an Important mediator of general 
inflammation. α-TNF activates neutrophils, eosinophils and endothelial cells to 
inflammation where they release tissue damaging mediators. α-TNF also 
activates monocytes, macrophages and T-lymphocytes to cause the production 
of colony stimulating factors and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such IL1, IL6,  
 
IL8 and GM-CSF, which mediate the end effects of α-TNF. The ability of α-TNF 
to activate T-lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages and related cells has 
been implicated in the progression of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
infection. In order for these cells to become infected with HIV and for HIV 
replication to take place the cells must be maintained in an activated state. 
Cytokines such as α-TNF have been shown to activate HIV replication in 
monocytes and macrophages. Features of endotoxic shock such as fever, 
metabolic acidosis, hypotension and intravascular coagulation are thought to 
be mediated through the actions of α-TNF on the hypothalamus and in 
reducing the anti-coagulant activity of vascular endothelial cells. The cachexia 
associated with certain disease states is mediated through indirect effects on 
protein catabolism. α-TNF also promotes bone resorption and acute phase 
protein synthesis. WO Patent Application No. 92/12961
