<ABSTRACT>
All of the air entering is raised to a high pressure then cooled to an intermediate temperature. At this temperature, a part of the air is turbined (at 5) at medium pressure, and the rest is liquified. The low-pressure column operates under a pressure of the order of 1.7 to 5 bar absolute, and its residual gas is expanded through a second turbine (8) after having been partially reheated. Application to producing impure oxygen under pressure and, simultaneously, at least one liquid product.

Process for producing gaseous oxygen and/or gaseous 
nitrogen under pressure, of the type in which : 


air is distilled in a double distillation column (10) 
comprising a low pressure column (12) operating at a pressure 

known as the low pressure, and a medium pressure column (11) 
operating at a pressure known as the medium pressure; 
all the air to be distilled is compressed (in 1, 4) to at 
least one high air pressure appreciably greater than the 

medium pressure; 
the compressed air is cooled to an intermediate temperature 
and a part of this is expanded in a turbine (5) to the medium 

pressure before introducing it into the medium pressure column 
(11); 
the non-turbined air is liquefied and then introduced, after 
expansion (in 19, 20), in the double column; and 
at least one liquid product withdrawn from the double column 
is brought to the production pressure and this liquid product 

is vaporised by heat exchange with air, 
 
characterized in that : 


the low pressure column (12) is operated under pressure; 
and 
the residual gas from the top of the low pressure column is 
expanded in a second turbine (8), after having been partially 

reheated, and in that the inlet temperature (T2) of the second 
turbine (8) is close to the liquefaction step (G) or of the 

main liquefaction step of air. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
low pressure column (12) is operated at approximately 1.7 to 

5 bar and the medium pressure column (11) at a pressure 
corresponding to approximately 6.5 to 16 bar. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the inlet temperature of the air turbine (5) is higher than 

the inlet temperature of the second turbine (8). 
Process according to one of the preceding claims wherein 
liquid oxygen is withdrawn which is intended to be vaporised 

by heat exchange with the air a few plates above the point 
where liquid oxygen is withdrawn for storage (15). 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the 
liquid product or one of the liquid products is liquid 

nitrogen.
