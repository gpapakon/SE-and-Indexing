<ABSTRACT>
A damper comprises a case (20) comprising a hollow body having a chamber 
surrounded by an inner wall and filled with a viscous fluid, a moving member 

(11) being inserted within said chamber (22) of said case (20) and relatively 
moved to said chamber (22) thereof and having at least a portion which 

deforms in response to the change of viscosity resistance due to temperature 
change, wherein either the case or moving member is connected to a rotation 

driving source (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a damper, a rotary 
damper, and a reciprocating damper for damping a motion by 
means of the viscosity resistance of a viscous fluid, and it 
further relates to an opener device as an ashtray device, 
device having a movable member, and so on provided with the 
rotary and reciprocating damper. A prior art rotary damper using a viscous fluid is 
disclosed in Japanese Pat. Laid Open Pub. No.61-192937 which 
arranges a rotary plate B provided with circular arch portions 
on the both ends in a thin cylindrical accommodation chambers C 
in which a viscous fluid F is filled, as shown in Fig. 1. The prior art rotary damper described above decelerates 
the rotating motion by employing the viscosity resistance of 
the viscous fluid filled in the accommodation chambers C. 
Therefore there was a disadvantage that the damping 
characteristics change and the decelerated rotating speed 
varies, since the viscosity resistance of the viscous fluid 
varies in response to the temperature changes. In particular, when the temperature became 0°C or less, 
the viscosity resistance is suddenly increased and the 
damping and the decelerating make more action than is  
 
necessary, resulting in frequent problems in operation. Now, the present inventors have given their attention 
to the technical idea of the invention that the effective cross 
section of a moving member is varied in response to the 
variation in viscosity resistance of a viscous fluid 
due to temperature change. It is a general object of this invention to roughly 
make uniform the variations in damping characteristics and 
in decelerated moving speed under any temperature change. It is a more specific object of the invention to 
prevent any operating faults based on the variation of the 
damping characteristics. It is another object of the invention to provide an 
ashtray device, the other devices in automobile, house and so 
on equipped with a damper having less change in damping 
characteristics due to temperature change. It is still another object of the invention to provide 
a rotary damper having a small capacity and being excellent in 
damping characteristics. It is a further object of the invention to provide a 
rotary damper whose rotating effective cross section is 
varied in response to the variation in viscosity resistance of 
a viscous fluid sealed in the damper due to temperature change. It is a still further object of the invention to 
provide a rotary damper having a rotating member whose 
effective length in a
