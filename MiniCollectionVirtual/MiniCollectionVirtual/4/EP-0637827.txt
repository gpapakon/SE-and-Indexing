<ABSTRACT>
A rechargeable electric power supply device comprises a supply unit 
including a pair of electrodes spaced apart from each other embedded in a 

mixture of (a) fired fine pellets of an electron absorbing material 
consisting of Nb₃Sn and V₃Ge, (b) fine particles of a mixed electron 

absorbing material comprising V₃Ga, Bi, CuO, Sr and FeO₂, (c) fine 
particles of a catalyst, (d) fine particles of C and FeO₂ serving as a 

stabilizer, and (e) a plasticizer, and a casing for accommodating the pair 
of electrodes and the mixture therein so that the pair of electrodes are 

individually in intimate contact with the mixture. The device serves as a 
kind of capacitor with great charge power and the capability of emitting 

electrons over a long time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electric power supply device and more 
particularly, to a rechargeable electric power supply device which is 
adapted for use in solar modules, such as solar cars, solar boats, solar 
scooters and the like, along with known lead and like batteries as it is, for instance, known from JP-A-02 149 406. Because 
the rechargeable device exhibits good constant current charge and 
constant voltage charge characteristics, the functions of the solar 
modules are fully complemented with increasing charge efficiency and 
utilization efficiency being attained. The rechargeable device has such a 
great electric capacitance that it is rechargeable like capacitors from the 
standpoint of its function. With rechargeable batteries which are employed in known solar 
modules as having, for example, a rating of DC 12V, the electric 
generation from the solar module is not enough to charge the battery 
under rainy or cloudy weather conditions. If the battery is charged at a 
potential of DC 12 V or below, the battery is not charged at all irrespective 
of how to generate electricity or how to charge. Thus, the generated 
electricity is discharged only in vain.  
 Various types of DC charge devices have been heretofore proposed. 
However, all the devices have complicated structures. Nevertheless, great 
constant current charge characteristic and constant voltage charge 
characteristics are not obtained with a low charge efficiency. More 
particularly, substantially all electric charges pass at one time and 
disappear at the time of primary discharge, and a charge time is long. 
When charge and discharge operations are repeated, the solar modules 
may often suffer damages, resulting in the shortage of life of the module. 
Thus, the known charge devices are disadvantageous in the complicated 
structure and also in economy. It is an object of the invention to provide a rechargeable electric power 
supply device which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art 
counterparts and which has great charge power, enabling electrons to 
emit over a prolonged time. It is another object of the invention to provide a rechargeable electric 
power supply device which is rechargeable to a significant level by 
application of a low potential within a very short time of about several 
seconds and has a very great electric capacitance. It is a further object of the invention to provide a rechargeable electric 
power supply device which is able to discharge a required quantity of 
electricity with little residual
