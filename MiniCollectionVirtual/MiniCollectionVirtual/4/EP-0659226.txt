<ABSTRACT>
A composite material (1) formed of a perforate metal sheet (2) and a coating of vapour permeable water resistant polymer (3). The polymer coating is in the form of polyvinyl chloride or a synthetic rubber material and may be bounded by adhesive or cured onto the perforate metal sheet. The composite material can be profiled to form a supporting structure. The perforate metal sheet is ideally perforate for 25 % of its surface area thereby allowing the composite material to have 25 % of the vapour permeability of the polymer coating whilst providing a material with structural properties of a sheet metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
"Composite Material"This invention relates to a composite material.Vapour permeable, water resistant polymers are known and their vapour permeability is an important feature when being used in the building and construction industry. The polymers have the disadvantages that they are not structurally supportive and therefore their application is limited. Hitherto, such polymers particularly PVC, have been applied to non-perforated metals. This combination is used for flashings in single ply roof covering systems where the PVC is generally in sheet or coil form and is reinforced with glass fibre or some other non-rigid weave reinforcement. The reinforced polymer on its own is often too flexible to be used as flashings which have to be bent into pre-formed shapes. Thus bonding to, or coating metal gives the necessary rigidity for forming. the non-perforated metal, however, this stops the vapour permeability of the polymer which is its most unique aspect.Metal sheeting can be shaped and formed into water 

resistant roofing material and cladding panels. The most common application of this is profiled steel or aluminium panels which are commonly used on industrial and commercial buildings. Such roofing material is usually combined with insulation and a vapour barrier to form a roof or wall cladding system.As metal is impermeable to water vapour any moisture forming within such a roof or cladding system can have a detrimental effect on its performance by corroding the metal. There are many different roof systems of this nature available but unless they are installed 100% efficiently, problems can occur. A number of attempts have been made to resolve this problem, however these tend to be so complex that the human factor and conditions under which the work has to be carried out, are overlooked. As roofing has the highest incidence of failure of any element in a building it is of crucial importance to overcome or mitigate these problems.The substructure to a roof is also of great importance. Timber in the form of boards, plywood or particle board and non-perforated metal are the traditional surfaces to which mechanically fixed roof coverings, as distinct from bonded coverings, are fixed.However, timber has the disadvantages in this function that it can rot and it must be allowed to dry to an optimum range of value of moisture content per volume of wood as required by trade standards prior to covering. Metal or timber with a dense surface can hold any moisture that accumulates in the form of condensation or a
