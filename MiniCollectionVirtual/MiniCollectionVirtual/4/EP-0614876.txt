<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing an aromatic carbonate by reacting an aromatic 

hydroxy compound, carbon monoxide and oxygen using as a 
catalyst a specified catalyst system containing palladium and 

cerium compounds. Specifically, the present invention 
relates to a method of producing an aromatic carbonate by 

reacting an aromatic hydroxy compound, carbon monoxide and 
oxygen in the presence of a catalyst containing the following 

compounds: 

(A) at least one selected from palladium and 
palladium compounds; 
(B) at least one of trivalent or tetravalent cerium 
compounds; 
(C) at least one selected from quaternary ammonium 
salts and quaternary phosphonium salts; 
(D) at least one selected from quinones and 
reduction products thereof, i.e., aromatic diols; or 
(A) and (B) components of the above; and 
(E) at least one inorganic halide selected from 
alkali metal halides and alkali earth metal halides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing an aromatic carbonate from an aromatic hydroxy 
compound, carbon monoxide and oxygen using a specified 
catalyst system. An aromatic carbonate, particularly 
diphenyl carbonate is useful as a raw material for 
polycarbonate or the like. A method of reacting an aromatic hydroxy compound 
with phosgene is generally used for producing an aromatic 
carbonate. However, this method has many problems as an 
industrial production method because of the high toxicity of 
phosgene and the by-production of large amounts of inorganic 
salts. Some methods have thus been proposed which do not 
use phosgene in which an aromatic carbonate is produced from 
an aromatic hydroxy compound, carbon monoxide and oxygen. Japanese Patent Publication No. 56-38144 discloses a 
method which uses as a catalyst a palladium compound, a 
compound containing a metal from the groups IIIA, IVA, VA, 
VIA, IB, IIB, VIB or VIIB in the periodic table, and a base. 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 56-38145 discloses a method 
which uses a palladium compound, a manganese or cobalt 
complex, a base and a desiccating agent. Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open No. 1-165551 discloses a method which uses a 
palladium compound, iodine and zeolite. Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open No. 2-104564 discloses a method which uses a  
 
palladium compound, a bivalent or trivalent manganese 
compound, tetraalkylammonium halide and quinone. Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open No. 2-142754 discloses a palladium compound, 
a bivalent or trivalent cobalt compound, tetraalkylammonium 
halide and quinone. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-25095 
discloses a method which uses a palladium compound, a cobalt 
compound, an organic or inorganic halide and a basic compound. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-58961 discloses a method 
which uses a palladium compound, a cobalt compound and an 
alkali metal halide. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-97775 (U.S. Patent 
No. 5,142,086 and European Patent Laid-Open No. 507,546-A2) 
discloses a method which uses a catalyst system comprising (a) 
a palladium compound; (b) a quaternary ammonium salt; (c) an 
inorganic compound as a cocatalyst selected from cobalt, iron, 
cerium, manganese, molybdenum, samarium, vanadium chromium and 
copper compounds; (d) an organic cocatalyst selected from 
aromatic ketones, aliphatic ketones, and aromatic polycyclic 
coal tar hydrocarbons. However, these methods have critical problems 
concerning the low activity of the catalyst used, and the low 
yield of an aromatic
