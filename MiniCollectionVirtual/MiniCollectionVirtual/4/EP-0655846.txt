<ABSTRACT>
A signal transmission device with a signal transmission line (3) between two transceiver arrangements (1, 2) contains inserted in the signal line (3) an electronic device (4) which enables the signal transmission to be interrupted triggered by control signals (control lines 22, 23). This device (4) contains means (8, 9, 10, 11) which, when one of the transceiver arrangements (1, 2) is operating as transmitter, prevents transmission operation of the respective other ones of these arrangements (1, 2) by utilizing the received signals.

<CLAIMS>
Signal transmitting apparatus comprising a signal transmitting line whose
ends are connected in each case to a transmitter-receiver arrangement for the

signals and in the run of said line is provided a device which permits or
prevents the transmission of signals depending upon the control signals

received by said device, characterised in that the device (4) comprises
between two further transmitter-receiver arrangements (5,6), which are

permanently connected to the line (3), a connection circuit which is
influenced by the control signals with means (8, 9, 10, 11) for obtaining

signals for preventing the receiver operation of the respective other
transmitter-receiver arrangement (5,6) operating in the transmission

operation from the receiving signals of the respective other transmitter-receiver
arrangement (5,6) operating in the receiving operation.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the connection circuit
comprises two AND-couplings (8, 9) whose outputs are connected

individually to a receiving input (12, 13) of one allocated of the other
transmitter-receiver arrangements (5, 6), whilst a first input (16, 17) of each

AND-coupling (8,9) is connected to the transmission output of the respective
non-allocated other transmitter-receiver arrangement (5,6), on the other hand

a second input (14, 15) of each AND-couplings (8,9) is connected via a turn-off
delay (10, 11) to the output of the respective other AND-coupling (8,9)

and third inputs (20, 21) of both AND-couplings (8,9) are influenced by the
control signals.
