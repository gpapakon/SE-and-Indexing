<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is provided to transport parisons (10) from the 
extrusion die (12) to a second location. The parison (10) is 

extruded and a collar 
means (20,30,46,49) is provided to contact the parison (10) near its 

upper end and create a 
holding geometry whereby the parison (10) is retained 

by the collar means (20,30,46,49) 
without pinching the parison (10). The parison (10) is then 

transported vertically or 
horizontally to the mold unit (11,13) without closing or 

pinching the parison (10). The 
holding geometry is created by slightly deforming 

the parison (10) wall near the 
collar means (20,30,46,49). The parison (10) is therefore transported 

to the second location, 
for example a mold unit (11,13), instead of moving the mold unit (11,13), 

to the parison (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to a method and apparatus for making hollow plastic
products, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for transporting the
parison of molten plastic to a second location, such as a mold unit, without pinching
the parison before the parison is in the second location.It is well known in the art to make hollow plastic products such as containers or
other like products using the extrusion blow-molding process. In the extrusion blow-molding
process, plastic in a melted state is introduced into a mold. The molten
plastic is generally extruded into a cylindrically-shaped tube or hose referred to as a
parison. The mold is closed and the interior of the mold is then pressurized to force
the melted plastic onto the interior walls of the mold, which is then allowed to cool
so that the plastic solidifies. The end product is a hollow plastic product having the
shape of the interior of the mold. In some applications, such as the production of fuel
tanks for automobiles, the parisons may be 2.44m (8 feet) or more in length.In the extrusion blow-molding process, the parison is formed by pressing the melted
plastic through a die in one or two ways, either by the accumulator method or by the
continuous extrusion method. In the accumulator method, a hydraulic means
intermittently forces the melted plastic through the die to form the parisons. In the
continuous method, the melted plastic flows continuously through the die to form
the parison.Previously, only small and mid-size plastic hollow products could be produced using
the continuous extrusion blow-molding method. Recent developments in the art of
blow-molding have allowed the production of larger sized products using the
continuous method. In order to produce the larger containers, however,
correspondingly larger equipment is required. As well, the parison must be
correspondingly larger in diameter and length. For this reason, two different versions of the continuous extrusion blow-molding
process are known. In the first version, the die is located above the mold unit and the
parison is transported vertically down into the mold unit. The disadvantage with this
version of the method is that the equipment is very tall where large products are to be
produced. In some applications, the equipment can be as high as 12.2 to 13.73m (40 to 45 feet).
Therefore, much taller buildings are required to house the equipment.A further disadvantage of the vertical transportation version of the continuous
process is that the parison must be
