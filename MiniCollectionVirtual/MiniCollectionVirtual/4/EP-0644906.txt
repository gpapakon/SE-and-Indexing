Process for preparing composites by backing a plastics 
film, as the top layer, with a reaction mixture which 

reacts to give a flexible or semi-rigid polyurethane 
foam and consists of 


a) a polyisocyanate component, 
b) a polyol component containing no salt groups, 
c) at least one blowing agent, 
d) alkali metal salts of hydroxycarboxylic acids as 
catalysts, and optionally 
e) further auxiliary agents and additives known from 
polyurethane chemistry and 
 
optionally, further catalysts known per se, which do 

not correspond to the definition given for component 
d), in an amount of at most 1.0 wt.% with reference to 

the weight of component b),
 
characterised in that the reaction products formed 

from (i) at least trihydric alcohols with a molecular 
weight in the range 92 to 1 000 and (ii) 

intramolecular carboxylic anhydrides are used as 
component d), in an amount of 0.1 to 10 wt.%, with 

reference to the weight of component b), in the form 
of alkali metal salts, these containing, as a 

statistical average, at least 2 alcoholic hydroxyl 
groups and at least 0.5 alkali metal carboxylate 

groups per molecule.  
 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
polyisocyanate mixtures from the diphenylmethane 

series which are liquid at room temperature and 
optionally contain urethane, carbodiimide and/or 

uretdione groups, are used as component a). 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that polyetherpolyols or mixtures of polyetherpolyols 

with an (average) hydroxyl functionality of 2 to 4 and 
a molecular weight of 400 to 12 000, or mixtures of 

this type of polyetherpolyol with up to 10 wt%, with 
respect to the weight of polyetherpolyols, of 2 and/or 

3-hydric alcohols with a molecular weight of less than 
400, are used as component b). 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that water is used as component c).
