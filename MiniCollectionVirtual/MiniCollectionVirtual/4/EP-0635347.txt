<ABSTRACT>
A lens mold includes first (1) and second mold (2) members 
respectively having a concave (3) 

surface and a convex surface (4) for defining therebetween a lens cavity. 
One of the first and 

second mold members is configured to mechanically engage a ring of excess lens material 
upon polymerization of the lens material. Alternately, one of the first and second mold 

members includes a material formed along the periphery of a lens cavity (5) 
which causes the 

ring of excess lens material thereto. Furthermore, one of the first and second mold 
members is formed of a relatively transparent plastic material and includes an outer 

surface having an optical finish to permit optical inspection of a lens located on 
one of the 

concave and convex surfaces. Alternately, one of the first and second mold members is 
formed of a relatively opaque plastic material and includes an inner surface having an 

optical finish to permit optical inspection of a lens located on one of the concave and 
convex surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the inspection of contact lenses, and
more particularly, to a lens mold for use primarily in the manufacture of soft
contact lenses.Conventionally, a soft contact lens may be cast using a two-sided mold in which
one side of the mold includes a convex surface and the other side of the mold
includes an opposing concave surface, and in which a cavity for forming the lens
is defined by the opposing convex and concave surfaces: A lens is formed by
placing a lens material on one of the convex and concave surfaces, bringing the
two sides of the mold together to form the lens cavity and separating the two
sides of the mold to expose the cast lens after polymerization of the lens material.Furthermore, techniques are generally known for controlling the adhesion of the
cast lens upon separation of the two sides of the mold, i.e. for causing the cast
lens to exhibit an affinity to adhere to one of the convex and concave surfaces
upon separation of the two sides of the mold. The utilization of such techniques
helps eliminate the time consuming, manual labor that is otherwise required in
determining which surface the transparent cast lens has adhered to after
separation of the two sides of the mold. For example, European Patent
Application No.0367513 discloses a technique for ensuring that the cast lens
remains in contact with one side of the mold by flame polishing the convex
surface of the one side of the mold.Furthermore, United States Patent No.4,197,266 discloses that by fabricating the
two sides of the mold with materials which, while both wettable, have different
degrees of wettability, one can insure that the cast lens will adhere to the desired
surface of the mold upon separation. Additionally, United States Patent
No.4,150,073 discloses that the adhesion of the cast lens may be controlled by
exposing a mold surface to monomeric vapors. However, in manufacturing the contact lens, lens material of a sufficient quantity
to exceed the volume of the cavity is placed on one of the mold surfaces, and
then the two sides to the mold are brought together to form the lens cavity. The
WO 93/04848 describes that quantity of excess lens material is collected within
the mold body, along the outer periphery of the lens cavity, to form a ring of
excess polymerized lens material and, upon separation of the lens mold, this ring
of excess lens material is located at one of the mold sides.Furthermore, after the lens has been cast and the mold separated, testing of
certain physical
