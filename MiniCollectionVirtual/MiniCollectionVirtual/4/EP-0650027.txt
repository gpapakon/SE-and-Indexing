<ABSTRACT>
The interface arrangement is intended for data transmission between a carrier aircraft and a missile which is to be fired from the carrier aircraft and has a target homing head. The missile is connected to the carrier aircraft via a connecting cable (umbilical cable) (32) which is designed with a small number of wires for transmission of analogue signals and can be detached during firing. For optional operation of the carrier aircraft with a missile which is equipped either with an analogue target homing head which produces an analogue target offset signal or with an image-processing target homing head which produces a digital signal, at least two interfaces (22, 26) are connected to the connecting cable. One of the two interfaces (22) is set up for data transmission via the connecting cable from and to the analogue target homing head. The other interface (26) is set up for data transmission via the connecting cable from and to the image-processing target homing head. A controller (51) allows the optional connection of the connecting cable to in each case one of the two interfaces. The controller (51) responds to identification signals which indicate the type of target homing head and automatically activate the respective interface.

<CLAIMS>
Interface arrangement provided on the carrier aircraft side for the data transmission
between a computer system (10) provided on the carrier aircraft side and a data bus

(18) connected to this computer system (10) on one hand, and to a missile to be
fired from the carrier aircraft, which missile is provided with a target seeker head

and is connected to the carrier aircraft through a connection cable (32) detachable
when firing and provided with few leads for transmitting analog signals, a first

interface (22) being provided on the carrier aircraft side, which first interface (22)
is designed for signal transmission through the connection cable (32) between an

analog target seeker head of a missile and the data bus (18) provided on the carrier
aircraft side,
characterized in that,
 for optional use of missiles having analog target seeker head
or missiles having image processing target seeker heads, there is provided:


(a) a second interface (26) provided on the carrier aircraft side, which second
interface (26) is designed for signal transmission through the connection

cable (32) between an image processing target seeker head of a missile and
the data bus (18) provided on the carrier aircraft side,
(b) a control system (51) provided on the carrier aircraft side and connected to
the connection cable (32), which control system (51) responds to

identification signals from the missile, and
(c) switching means switchable in dependence on the identification signals by
the control system (51) provided on the carrier aircraft side, which switching

means, in a first switching state, connects the connection cable (32) to the
first interface (22) provided on the carrier aircraft side and, in a second

switching state, connects the connection cable (32) to the second interface
(26) provided on the carrier aircraft side.
Interface arrangement as set forth in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the switching
means are kept in the first switching state by the control system (51) provided on

the carrier aircraft side when no identification signals are received and are
switchable into the second switching state when identification signals are received.
Interface arrangement as set forth in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the carrier
aircraft includes a launcher (34) for firing the missile and the first interface (22)

provided on the carrier aircraft side and the second interface (26) provided on the
carrier aircraft side are arranged in the launcher (34).
Interface arrangement provided on the missile side for the data transmission
between a computer system (10) provided on the carrier aircraft side and a data bus

(18) connected to this computer system (10) on one hand and to a missile to be
fired from the carrier aircraft, which missile is provided with an image processing

target seeker head and a data bus (54) provided on the missile side and is connected
to the carrier aircraft through a connection cable (32) detachable when firing and

provided with few leads for transmitting analog signals,
characterized in that
, for optional use of the missile together with a computer
system (10) provided on the carrier aircraft side and designed for processing only

analog target deviation data from an analog target seeker head or together with a
computer system (10) provided on the carrier aircraft side and suitable for

processing digital image processing data from an image processing target seeker
head, there is provided:


(a) a first interface (58) provided on the missile side and connected to the data
bus (54), which first interface (58) is designed for converting complete data

records generated by the image processing target seeker head into analog
signals corresponding to the analog signals from an analog target seeker head

and for transmitting these signals through the connection cable, 
(b) a second interface (60) provided on the missile side and connected to the data
bus (54), which second interface (60) is designed for converting complete

data records received from the image processing target seeker head into a
format adapted to be transmitted through the connection cable (32),
(c) a control system (74) provided on the missile side and connected to the
connection cable (32), which control system (51) responds to identification

signals from the carrier aircraft, and
(d) switching means switchable in dependence on the identification signals by
the control system (74) provided on the missile side, which switching means,

in a first switching state, connects the connection cable (32) to the first
interface (58) provided on the missile side and, in a second switching state,

connects the connection cable (32) to the second interface (60) provided on
the missile side.
Interface arrangement as set forth in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the switching
means are kept in the first switching state by the control system (74) provided on

the missile side when no identification signals are received and are switchable into
