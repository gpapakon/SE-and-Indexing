<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a moisturizer for rehydrating or maintaining hydration in skin
and mucous membranes using bioadhesives in combination with humectants and water
complexing agents. In addition this moisturizer has lubricating properties derived
from the moisturizing properties and unctuous components which make it useful in
preventing abrasions or soreness and redness resulting from contact with other
materials.Moisturizers are widely available for treating topical skin problems like dry,
flaking or cracked skin caused by loss of water, or abrasions and redness caused by
exposure and rubbing. The consumer has many choices. But as a general rule skin
lotions and skin conditioners fall into a limited group of types of formulations which
can be broken out into two main categories, the oil-in-water emulsions and
hydrophobic barriers illustrated by the likes of petrolatum. Many of these formulations
can be used on either dermal or mucosal tissue and will work well on both types of
tissue, at least on the short or very short term of a few hours or so.Nearly all these products work by preventing or reducing moisture loss rather
than adding moisture back to the skin. Petrolatum and similar products are among the
best at preventing or reducing water loss, and since petrolatum adheres well to the skin,
it's residence time and its affect is extended. The major draw-back to its use is that
user acceptance is low because it is viewed as messy and unsightly; it does not absorb
well into the skin and the skin has what is viewed a peculiar feel. Oil-in-water
emulsions are usually more user acceptable as they are absorbed into the skin. but
often they lack a sustainable affect; water evaporation from the formula, once applied
to the skin is high, the barrier properties are relative low, and the formulation does not
remain on the skin in a useful form for very long.Attempts have been made to develop formulations which can replenish the
water lost through normal evaporation. Some compounds such as glycerol and some
amino acids like arginine have found some favor in these attempts and have been
labeled humectants. Along with work on humectants, xerogels have been used in an
attempt to increase the residence time on the skin of the water in the moisturizers.
Some of these formulations may have lubricating properties as well, though this is not
well documented. Two examples of interest in the context of one use of this invention
is Lubrin sold by Upsher-Smith Labs Inc., a suppository for treating vaginal dryness
and Replens
