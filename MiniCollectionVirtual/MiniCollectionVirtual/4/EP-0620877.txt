<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to an elastic fastening clamp in the shape of a double C for fixing a stretch of rail (4) on its respective sleeper (1) by means of a fastening plate (3) provided with matching notches, fixed on the sleeper (1) with elastic fastening clamps (5'), adjusted to each side of the rail at the corresponding notches of plate (3), the upper of the basis of clamp (5') having the shape of an arc with approximately the same radius as the notch of plate (3), or in other words, the surface of the basis of clamp (5') matches perfectly the surface in half circle of the notch of the plate (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention covers an improvement in an elastic fastening clamp
in form of a double C. Such clamp has the purpose of fastening the rail of a
railroad track to a support or sleeper.These clamps are technically known as DEENIK clamps and they are
fixed on a fastening plate which is screwed, say on wooden sleepers, by means of
bolts known as tirefonds.One serious inconvenience of this type of clamp is the violent wear
suffered by the parts of contact between the clamp and the plate, resulting into an
appreciable decrease in the useful service life of the plate.It is also known from document CH-A-388 360 an elastic fastening
clamp which comprises projections which are rounded so as to match part of the
semi-circular recess of the plate.The purpose of the invention is to modify the surface of contact
between the clamp and the plate by changing the shape of the clamp basis which
becomes an arc, having approximately the same radius as the notch of the plate
whose surface is half a circle.Therefore, the present invention concerns a rail fastening device as
described in the preamble of claim 1 and provided with the improvement
described in the characterising part of claim 1.This improvement in the invention has the advantage that now there
is a perfect adjustment between the clamp and the plate, and contact between these
two pieces is no longer by points, as it was the case with the conventional 
clamp, but involves the entire surface of the notch in the
plate. Furthermore the system proposed by this invention
gives more stability to the clamp and plate set and greater
resistance to longitudinal displacement since the rotatory
movement of the clamp around its own axis will become more
difficult.A better understanding of this invention will be
obtained by referring to the attached drawings, where:In figure 1 we have a representation in perspective of
the fastening system of rails to sleepers by means of clamp
and plate sets.In figure 2 we have a representation in perspective
similar to figure 1, but with the pieces disassembled so as
to give an exploded view.Figure 3 is a horizontal plane and a vertical plane of
the fastening plate showing the notch in such plate.Figure 4 is a view of a conventional clamp, a
transverse AB section of its basis and a cross section
showing the adjustment of the clamp basis to the fastening
plate.Figure 5 is a view of a clamp according to the invention, a
transverse AB section of its basis and a cross section
showing the adjustment of the clamp basis to the fastening
plate. In

<CLAIMS>
Rail fastening device comprising an elastic fastening clamp in the
shape of a double C for fixing a stretch of rail (4) to the respective sleeper (1) by

means of a fastening plate (3) provided with notches and fixed on the sleeper (1),
and by means of elastic fastening clamps (5') adjusted to each side of the rail in the

corresponding notches of the plate (3), each clamp comprising two Cs in parallel
arrangement, the free ends of each C bearing on the respective foot of the rail and

the opposite ends of each C being interconnected by a U-shaped basis which is
located in respective notches of the plate, characterised by the fact that, seen from

a view horizontally and at a right angle to the longitudinal direction of the rail, the
upper part of the basis of the clamp (5') has the shape of an arc with approximately

the same radius as the notch of the plate (3), or in other words, the surface of the
basis of the clamp (5') matches perfectly the semi-circular surface in the notch of

the plate (3).
