<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of allocating a free radio frequency beam channel (F, Fa) to each (S) of calling (Sk) and called (SI) stations of a satellite telecommunications network. When no free channel belongs to a beam (F) forming the coverage including one of the stations (S), the method searches (E11, ET11) for free channels in each of the beams adjacent (Fa) to the said beam (F), and allocates (EF2) to the said one of the stations (S) of one of the free channels of the adjacent beam (Fa), whenever, in an optimal subset of beams which consists of all the beams using the same channel as the said free channel, each with isolation level equal to the ratio of a gain of a main lobe of a respective one of the beams of the optimal subset to the sum of the maximum gains of secondary lobes of the other beams is greater than a given threshold.

A method of allocating a free radio beam
channel (F, Fa) by a control station (SC) to each of

calling (S
k
) and called (S
1
) stations of a satellite
telecommunication network (SA), in which re-using of

same channels in different beams is foreseen, in
response to reception of a call setting-up request

message emitted by said calling station (S
k
) via a
signalling channel of said satellite in said control

station (SC),

   said method entailing in simulation in the
control station (SC) one of first and second

alternatives (ET21) separately for each (S) of the
calling (S
k
) and called (S
1
) stations, and then a
final step,

   (a) - said first alternative whereby at least
one free channel belongs to a beam (F) forming a

coverage (C) including said each of the stations (S),
comprising allocation of said at least one free

channel to said each of the stations ; and

- said final step comprising emission of a call
setting-up authorization message from the control

station (SC) to said calling station as soon as a
beam free channel is allocated in simulation to each

of said calling and called stations (S
k
, S

).

   characterized in that

   (b) - said second alternative whereby no free
channel belongs to said beam (F) forming the coverage

(C) including said each of the stations (S),
comprises the iterative steps of :


(b1) searching (E21, ET22) for free channels in
each of adjacent beams (Fa) from that nearest to that

farthest from said beam (F) forming the coverage (C) 
including said each of the stations (S) until free

channels are identified in an adjacent beam, and
(b2) in response to said free channels
identified in said adjacent beam (Fa), allocating in

a simulated way one of said free channels identified
in said adjacent beam to said each of the stations

(S) by
transferring load (E22) between said coverage
(C) including said each of the stations (S) and an

adjacent coverage associated with said adjacent beam
by reducing in surface the coverage including said

each of the stations (S) and increasing in surface
said adjacent coverage so that said each of the

stations is located in the adjacent coverage, and
determining (ED) optimal subsets of beams each
comprising beams able to re-use the same channel, and

selecting (E23) said one of said free channels
identified in said adjacent beam (Fa) as that which

is least used in one of the optimal subsets of beams
including said adjacent beam.
The method according to claim 1,
characterized in that the step of determining optimal

subsets of beams (ED) comprises the iterative steps

incremented by 1 on each iterative step up to at most

I, and

said

I
 constituted subsets of T beams to the sum of
the respective maximal antenna gains of secondary

lobes (LL1, LL2) of the other beams in each of said

C
T

I
 subsets of T beam, provided that a conditional
relationship (ETO) establishing that T levels of

isolation (N(t)) calculated for at least one of said

C
T
 / 
I
 constituted subsets of T beams are more than a
threshold (TH) is satisfied,

   said optimal subsets of beams being made up of
subsets of beams from 
C T / I
L

T
L
 + 1)!] subsets of beams for each of which [
T

levels of isolation (N(t)) calculated are more than

said threshold, T
L
 denoting an integer number value
assumed by T for which said conditional relationship

is not satisfied (EF).
The method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that it comprises


in the simulation carried out in the control
station (SC), a third alternative (ET20) whereby said

each of the stations (S) is not located in any beam
coverage (F), comprising the steps (E24) of:


determining from the beam coverages existing in
the network a coverage nearest to said each of the

stations and a lowermost surface coverage;
by iteration, for determined each of said
nearest and lowermost surface coverages, reducing in

size the coverages other than said determined each of
the coverages whilst maintaining in said coverages

stations which are active prior to said reception of
the call setting-up request message, until said

determined each of the coverages can be increased to
include said each of the stations (S) with a

respective antenna gain in said determined each of
the coverages, and 
selecting one of said nearest and lowermost
surface coverages into a selected coverage as a

function of the higher of two antenna gains
respectively calculated for said nearest and

lowermost surface coverages to include said each of
the stations (S) in said selected coverage,
said step of selecting being followed by one of
said first and second alternatives (ET21) and by the

final step.
The method according to any one of claims 1
to 3, characterised in that it comprises, in response

(E30) to a number of busy channels in one (F) of the
beams in the network greater than the integer part of

a ratio of a number (CO) of busy channels in the
network to the number (I) of radio beams in the

network, execution of said second alternative (E21 to
E23) for each of the stations covered by said one of

the beams, when the number of the busy channels in
said one of the beams is greater than said integer

part, so that to each of said stations belonging to a
coverage of said one of the beams is assigned a radio

channel of a beam adjacent said one of the beams to
