<ABSTRACT>
A one-way valve of simple construction comprises a body 
provided with appropriate bores and four legs. A ball is 

positioned between the legs which are then bent towards each 
other to retain the ball in the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvement in one way 
valves in pneumatic mechanisms. Glass machines are generally pneumatically operated, 
and there is a need for one way valves which are reliable in 
operation but yet cheap to manufacture and easy to replace. In US 4 100 935 there is described a one way valve for 
use in a heat pump system which comprises a body having a 
head portion adapted for locating the valve in a bore and 
comprising an axial bore, a sleeve portion extending from 
the head portion and comprising four legs separated by 
longitudinally extending gaps, a valve seating formed at the 
junction of the head portion and the sleeve portion around 
an air opening provided by the axial bore and a ball 
positioned in the sleeve portion and adapted to seat on the 
valve seating. The legs comprise inturned end portions 
which restrict movement of the ball away from the valve 
seating. 
The one way valve is essentially 
designed for use in an axial flow situation, in which it is 
permanently crimped in position in a pipeline. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved 
one way valve which will be cheap to manufacture and 
versatile in use.  
 The present invention provides a one way valve for use 
in a pneumatic circuit comprising 
   an integral body comprising 
a head portion adapted for locating the valve in a 
bore and comprising an axial bore, a sleeve portion extending from the head portion 
and comprising a plurality of legs separated by 
longitudinally extending gaps and a valve seating formed at the junction of the 
head portion and the sleeve portion around an air opening 
provided by the axial bore 
and a ball positioned in the sleeve portion and adapted to 
seat on the valve seating  
characterised in that 
the head portion is provided with a transverse bore in 
communication with the axial bore and the legs of the sleeve portion are deformed radially 
inwards thus being bent inwardly so that they restrict 
movement of the ball away from the valve seating. There now follows a description of a valve embodying 
the invention which description is to be read with reference 
to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 shows a sectional view of a valve embodying 
the invention and in an open condition. Figure 2 shows a sectional view of the valve in a 
closed condition; Figure 3 shows a valve body of the valve in process of 
manufacture; Figure 4 shows a view of the valve body of the valve in 
the direction of the arrow A in Figure 3. The valve 2 is for use in a
