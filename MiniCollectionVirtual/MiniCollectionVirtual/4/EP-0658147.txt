<ABSTRACT>
In order to safely park a bicycle, the bicycle is pushed forward until the pedal bracket bearing (8) firmly touches the arm (2). The bicycle lock (15) is then inserted through the holes (5) nearest to the down-tube (6). The interaction between points (1, 2) and the holding means (3, 4) prevents the bicycle from moving. In another embodiment, a movable tube (14) fitted with a triangular prism (12) is pushed downwards until both yokes firmly contact the seat tube and down-tube (7, 6). By inserting the lock (15) through the appropriate holes (5) of both tubes (13, 14) the bicycle is firmly secured in all directions. This bicycle stand is designed for bicycle parking spaces or as a device for fastening bicycles transported on motor vehicles.
