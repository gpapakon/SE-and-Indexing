<ABSTRACT>
A releasably attachable manual dispensing aid 
(20) is operable with a syringe (22) having a 

syringe body (24) and a syringe plunger (32) that is 
movable within the syringe body (24). The 

dispensing aid (20) includes a dispensing aid body 
(40) that is releasably attachable to the syringe 

body (24). The dispensing aid (20) further includes 
a dispensing aid plunger (44) that is attachable to 

the syringe plunger (32), and has a slide (46) that 
is slidable within the dispensing aid body (40). An 

electronic linear position measuring device (52) has 
a first portion (54) fixed to the dispensing aid 

body (40) and a second portion (56) fixed to the 
dispensing aid plunger (44). Optionally, the 

dispensing aid (20) includes a microprocessor (78) 
that receives as inputs a calibration value for a 

particular syringe and the position signal, and 
determines as an output signal the true volume of 

liquid displaced by the syringe plunger movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a releasably attachable manual dispensing aid operable with a syringe according to the preamble of claim 1.A syringe is a device that permits the
dispensing of accurate volumes of liquids. A
microsyringe is similar in construction to a
conventional medical syringe and has a microsyringe
body and a microsyringe plunger. The microsyringe
dispenses liquids more accurately than does the
medical syringe due to control of the interior bore
diameter of the syringe body, control of the
relative geometry of the bore and the plunger, and
care taken to prevent leakage around the plunger.
Microsyringes are typically used in scientific
applications such as the injection of relatively
small, accurate volumes of liquids into
chromatographs and other instruments.One of the ongoing problems in using the
microsyringe is determining and controlling the
volume of liquid that is drawn into the microsyringe
body. The amount of liquid must be more precisely
determined than for most medical applications.
Moreover, the microsyringe is sometimes used for
mixing functions as part of its dispensing role.
That is, a first precise volume, less than the total
volume capacity of the microsyringe, of a first
liquid may be drawn into the microsyringe. Without
ejecting the first liquid, a second precise volume
may be thereafter drawn into the microsyringe.
Further precise amounts of other liquids may be
drawn into the microsyringe, so that the various
liquids mix together. Once the mixture is formed,
it may be ejected into a single receiver or several 
different receivers in precise amounts.At the present time, the user of the
microsyringe is required to view the graduations on
the side of the microsyringe body in order to
estimate the amount of fluid drawn into or ejected
from the syringe. The plunger must be moved
precisely in accordance with those graduations.
Errors can be made, particularly in poor lighting
conditions, where multiple complex operations are
required, or where the operator is fatigued.A number of approaches have been advanced for
improving upon this situation. For example, fully
automated dispensing devices have been developed.
These devices are complex and bulky, and not really
suited to assist in manual dispensing of liquids
with a syringe or microsyringe. Manual digital
dispensers, such as that of US Patent 4,959,056,
have also been proposed. In the device of the '056
patent, the syringe is inserted into the dispensing
device. The plunger of the syringe is movable by a
lead screw operable
