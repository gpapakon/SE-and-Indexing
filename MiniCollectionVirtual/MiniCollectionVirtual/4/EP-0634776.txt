<ABSTRACT>
A known step to prevent light emitted by the phosphor layer of the exit 
screen in the direction of the photocathode from causing an additional, disturbing 

electron beam cannot be used in a proximity-type image intensifier tube. The known 
step includes the deposition of a reflecting aluminium layer on the phosphor layer. 

During deposition of said aluminium layer, the exit screen is necessarily exposed to a 
high temperature which cannot be withstood by the image detection matrix. An image 

intensifier tube in accordance with the invention utilizes a phosphor layer which emits 
light of a wavelength range whereto the photocathode is insensitive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an image intensifier tube comprising an entrance 
screen with a photocathode and an exit screen with a phosphor layer for converting 
photoelectrons from the photocathode into radiation, which exit screen comprises an 
image detection matrix for deriving an electronic signal from the radiation. An image intensifier tube of this kind is known from NL-A-90 00 267 laid open to public inspection. The known image intensifier tube is an X-ray image intensifier tube in 
which an image-carrying X-ray beam is converted into light which is incident on the 
photocathode so as to generate an image-carrying electron beam. A vacuum exists in the 
gastight envelope in order to minimize electron beam scattering. The image-carrying 
electron beam is imaged on the phosphor layer by the electron-optical system. The 
electron beam incident on the phosphor layer generates light therein, which light is 
emitted by the photocathode. The light generated in the phosphor layer is emitted in the 
forward direction towards the image detection matrix in which the image information is 
converted into an electronic image signal. If no steps are taken, the phosphor layer also 
emits light in the backward direction, i.e. towards the photocathode. The light emitted 
in the backward direction by the phosphor layer and incident on the photocathode 
generates an additional, disturbing electron beam. The phosphor layer also converts the 
additional, disturbing electron beam into light which is detected by the image detection 
matrix and thus disturbs the electronic image signal. United States Patent Specification US-A-4,140,900 discloses a reflecting 
aluminium layer provided on the phosphor layer of an X-ray image intensifier tube. 
Such a reflecting layer ensures that light emitted backwards by the phosphor layer 
cannot reach the photocathode. Providing an aluminium reflecting layer on the phosphor 
layer when the latter has been provided on a semiconductor image detection matrix, 
however, is not possible by means of known technology. The deposition of such an 
aluminium reflecting layer requires a process step during which the phosphor layer with  
 
the image detection matrix is exposed to a high temperature, notably higher than 400°C. 
When a semiconductor image detection matrix is exposed to a temperature higher than 
200° C, the operation of the image detection matrix will be affected. It is inter alia an object of the invention to provide an image intensifier 
tube comprising an image detection matrix in
