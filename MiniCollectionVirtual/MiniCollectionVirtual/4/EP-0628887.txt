<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus (1) includes a generating 
section for generating an image signal representing an 

image of a predetermined density, an image forming 
section (3) for forming an image on a 

recording medium (19) on 
the basis of the image signal generated by the 

generating section, a measurement 
section (600) for measuring 

the density of the image formed on the recording 
medium (19), and a control section for determining a 

condition for image formation on the basis of a 
measurement result from the measurement section (600). The 

control section selects a density of the image signal 
to be either within a range from a first to a second density level or 

within a range from said second density level to a third density level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming 
apparatus, which can reproduce a gray-scale image. In a conventional image processing apparatus of an 
electrophotographic system, such as a copying machine, 
a laser beam printer, or the like, it is known that, in 
order to maintain a constant output density of a formed 
image, a change in environment of a developer is 
measured by an environment sensor, and image formation 
conditions and image processing conditions are changed 
by a control means in accordance with the type of 
developer, environmental conditions, and environmental 
history (see U.S. Patent No. 4,888,618). In this U.S. Patent No. 4,888,618, however, when a 
gray-scale image is formed, a high-density portion of 
an image can be formed to have a proper density, but a 
low-density portion is often formed not to have a 
proper density. As a result, a high-quality image 
cannot often be obtained. Another method is also proposed. In this method, 
a plurality of predetermined density patterns formed 
for density detection on an image carrier are detected, 
and detection results are fed back to image formation  
 
conditions and image processing conditions (see U.S. 
Patent No. 4,888,636, U.S. Patent Application S.N. 760,505, 
for example). In U.S. Patent No. 4,888,636 and U.S. Patent 
Application S.N. 760,505, however, the predetermined 
density patterns can only be formed, and it is often 
insufficient for gray-scale control with higher 
precision. When an image having higher quality is to be 
formed, for example, a color printer, which can form 
four color toner images, and can output 256 gray-scale 
levels, must output 4 x 256 patterns. If this 
operation is performed every time each pattern is 
output, this results in a decrease in output 
throughput, and an increase in toner consumption. When a density pattern formed for density 
detection on a photosensitive drum is detected by a 
sensor, if the sensor is stained with a toner, a 
precise density measurement cannot be performed, and 
high-precision gray-scale control is disturbed. The photosensitive (body) drum slightly suffers 
from eccentricity since it is rotated about a shaft. 
Therefore, even when the photosensitive drum is 
uniformly changed, the surface potential varies 
depending on the position on the surface of the drum, 
and high-precision gray-scale control cannot often be 
performed.  In U.S. Patent No. 4,888,636 and U.S. Patent 
Application S.N. 760,505, gray-scale control is 
performed by correcting only γ
