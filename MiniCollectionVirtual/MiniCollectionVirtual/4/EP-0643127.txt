<ABSTRACT>
Contact of acid or alkaline cleaned aluminum surfaces, 
particularly cans, with a water based composition containing 

a combination of 

(A)
water-soluble ethoxylated organic material selected from 
the group consisting of ethoxylated fatty acids, salts of 

ethoxylated fatty acids, ethoxylated alcohols 
having at least 4 carbon atoms and containing up to 20 moles of 

condensed ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, ethoxylated alkyl alcohol 
phosphate ester, and mixtures thereof; and 
(B)
an amount of hydrogen peroxide effective to prevent 
deterioration of the composition by the action of microorganisms, 
gives the surface after drying lowered surface friction 
without loss of high quality printability and lacquer 

adhesion and removes any brown spotting on the cans that 
may have developed during the cleaning or post-cleaning 

rinses. The cans after treatment are substantially free 
from any water breaks when rinsed with water. The foaming 

resistance and storage stability of the water based composition 
may be advantageously increased by adding a combination of liquid 

paraffin, solid wax, and a high molecular weight fatty acid 
derivative(s) as antifoam agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns processes and compositions for
improving the mobility of aluminium cans when conveyed by
automatic conveying equipment.It is already known, e.g. from United States Patent
No. 4,859,351, that the mobility of an aluminium can when
conveyed may be improved by contacting its exterior
surface, after cleaning and before final drying, with an
aqueous lubricant and surface conditioner composition so as
thereby to form a film on the can surface after drying
which reduces the coefficient of static friction of the
surface of the can to not more than 1.5.This invention is particularly directed toward aqueous
compositions suitable for contacting formed metal surfaces
to deposit thereon after drying a mobility enhancing
lubricant film, said compositions being protected against
deterioration from the action of microorganisms during
storage and/or against foaming during use.It is convenient at this point to note that in this
description, except in the claims and the operating
examples or where examples or where explicitly otherwise
indicated, all numbers describing amounts of ingredients or
reaction conditions are to be understood as modified by the
word "about" in defining the broadest scope of the
invention. Operation within the exact numerical limits
specified is generally preferred. Also, except where
otherwise stated, whenever more than one material is stated
to be suitable for a particular component of a composition,
it is to be understood that mixtures including any two or 
more of the listed materials are also equally suitable.It has now been found that the known lubricating and
surface conditioning compositions, e.g. as in the above-mentioned
U.S. Patent 4,859,351, need to be protected
against deterioration from micro-organisms during storage
and/or use and/or from foaming during preparation and/or
use. One must however avoid the use of any antimicrobial
or biocidal agent on the one hand, or any antifoam agent on
the other, which will have a deterimental effect on the
mobility-enhancing properties or the stability of the
composition.According to one aspect of this invention there is
provided a process for improving the mobility of an
aluminium can when conveyed by automatic conveying
equipment, comprising the steps of cleaning the can with an
aqueous acidic or alkaline cleaning solution, drying the
cleaned can, and subsequently conveying the cleaned and
dried can via said conveying equipment to a location where
it is lacquered or decorated by printing or both, at least
one exterior

<CLAIMS>
A process for improving the mobility of an aluminium
can when conveyed by automatic conveying equipment,

comprising the steps of cleaning the can with an aqueous
acidic or alkaline cleaning solution, drying the cleaned

can, and subsequently conveying the cleaned and dried can
via said conveying equipment to a location where it is

lacquered or decorated by printing or both, at least one
exterior surface of said aluminium can, prior to the last

drying of said exterior before automatic conveying, being
contacted with a lubricant and surface conditioner

composition so as thereby to form a film on the can surface
after drying which reduces the coefficient of static

friction of the surface of the can to not more than 1.5,
and in which the lubricant and surface conditioner

composition employed contains an amount of hydrogen
peroxide effective to prevent deterioration of the

composition by the action of microorganisms during storage
and use and/or an amount effective to reduce foaming of a

mixture of solid wax, liquid paraffin and high molecular
weight fatty acid derivative molecules.
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which the
lubricant and surface conditioner composition employed is

otherwise an aqueous solution of water-soluble ethoxylated
organic material being one or more of the following, namely

ethoxylated fatty acid(s) and salt(s), amide(s), ether(s)
and ester(s) of ethoxylated fatty acid(s) and of hydroxy-substituted

ethoxylated fatty acid(s), and ethoxylated
alcohol(s) and ethoxylated phosphate ester(s).
A process as claimed in claim 2, in which the water-soluble
ethoxylated organic material is or includes one or

more ethoxylated fatty acid(s), salt(s) of ethoxylated 
fatty acid(s), ethoxylated alcohol(s) having at least 4

carbon atoms and containing up to 20 moles of condensed
ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol and/or ethoxylated alkyl

alcohol phosphate ester(s).
A process as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
in which the lubricant and surface conditioner composition

employed has a pH of between 1 and 6.5.
A process as claimed in claim 4, in which the pH of
the lubricant and surface conditioner composition is

between 2.5 and 5.
A liquid lubricant and surface conditioner
composition, suitable for use in the process claimed in any

of the preceding claims by application to at least one
exterior surface of a cleaned aluminium can to improve the

mobility of the can when conveyed, said composition
comprising a solution in water of water-soluble ethoxylated

organic material being one or a mixture of more than one of
the following, namely ethoxylated fatty acids, salts,

amides, ethers and esters of ethoxylated fatty acids and of
hydroxy-substituted ethoxylated fatty acids, ethoxylated

alcohols and ethoxylated phosphate esters, together with an

deterioration of the composition by the action of
microorganisms during storage and use, said liquid
