<DESCRIPTION>
 DOPPLER MEMBER HAVING INFLATABLE BALLOONThis invention relates to a doppler guide wire having an inflatable balloon mounted thereon. Dilatation catheters have heretofore been provided as, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,582,181. Doppler guide wires have been provided as, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,059,851. However, a need has arisen for balloon dilatation catheters which have ultrasonic capabilities which requirements are not met by the devices disclosed in either of the cited patents. There is, therefore, a need for a doppler guide wire which has an inflatable balloon mounted thereon which meets these requirements.In general, it is an object of the present invention to provide a doppler guide wire having an inflatable balloon mounted thereon.Another object of the invention is to provide a guide wire of the above characters which has a small diameter so that it can be inserted into small and tortuous vessels. 

 Another object of the invention is to provide a guide wire of the above character which is very flexible.Another object of the invention is to provide a guide wire of the above character in which the balloon can be readily inflated and deflated." Another object of the invention is to provide a guide wire of the above character which facilitates the making of ultrasonic measurements to ascertain blood flow velocity.Additional objects and features of the invention will appear from the following description in which the preferred embodiments are set forth in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.FIGURE 1 is a side elevational view partially in cross- section of a doppler guide wire having an inflatable balloon mounted thereon and incorporating the present invention.FIGURE 2 is an enlarged detail view of the distal extremity of the guide wire shown in Figure l.FIGURE 3 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 3-3 of Figure 2.Detailed Description of the InventionIn general, the doppler guide wire having an inflatable balloon mounted thereon is comprised of an elongate flexible guide wire having proximal and distal extremities. An ultrasonic transducer is provided. Means is provided for securing the ultrasonic 

transducer to the distal extremity of the guide wire. An inflatable balloon is mounted on the distal extremity of the guide wire proximal of the ultrasonic transducer. A lumen opening into the interior of the balloon extends along the length of the guide wire. Conductive means is connected to the ultrasonic transducer and extends along the length of the guide

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS
1. In a doppler guide wire having an inflatable balloon secured thereon which is inflatable with a balloon inflation medium, an elongate flexible member having proximal and distal extremities, an ultrasonic transducer, means securing the ultrasonic transducer to the distal extremity of the elongate flexible member, said inflatable balloon fixedly mounted on the distal extremity of the elongate flexible member proximal of the ultrasonic transducer, a balloon inflation lumen opening into the interior of the balloon and extending along the length of the elongate flexible member for introducing the balloon inflation medium into the balloon and conductor means connected to the ultrasonic transducer and extending along the length of the elongate flexible member.
2. A guide wire as in Claim 1, wherein said balloon inflation lumen is formed by a tubular member extending coaxially over the elongate flexible element to provide an annular lumen extending into the interior of the balloon.
3. A guide wire as in Claim 2, wherein said tubular member and said balloon are formed integral with each other.
4. A guide wire as in Claim 2, wherein said conductor means extends through the balloon inflation lumen.
5. A guide wire as in Claim 1, wherein said means for securing ultrasonic transducer to the distal extremity of the elongate flexible element includes a coil spring. 


6. A guide wire as in Claim 4 together with a protective sheath enclosing the conductor means for protecting the conductor means from the balloon inflation medium.
