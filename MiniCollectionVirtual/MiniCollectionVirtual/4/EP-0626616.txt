<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antistat coating
compositions and to antistat layers produced by applying
such compositions to supports. More particularly it
relates to photographic elements containing at least one
such antistat layer.U.S. Patent 4,203,769 issued May 20, 1980 to
Guestaux relates to antistatic layers for photographic
applications based on vanadium pentoxide. In addition to
the conductive metal oxide, various polymeric binders are
added to increase the mechanical durability of the
antistatic layer. In particular, various cellulose
derivatives are used for this purpose including cellulose
acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, methyl cellulose,
cellulose acetate phthalate and cellulose etherphthalate.
These cellulose derivative binders together with vanadium
pentoxide form particularly stable dispersions in solvent
mixtures. These solutions can be stored for long periods
without the formation of precipitates of the oxide. They
can also be filtered to remove large particulates without
plugging the filter media with metal oxide. Both are
essential for the practical use of vanadium pentoxide in
manufacturing.However, when such coating solutions are
applied to cellulose acetate film supports by immersion
roll coating, significant coating defects result. These
coating solutions, which are stable in their own right,
are unstable in the presence of the cellulose triacetate
film support. As a result, precipitates of the metal
oxide form in the coating bead and are then deposited as
visible specks in the coating layer. Such specks are
objectionable in a photographic film product. JP58062647 discloses a silver halide photographic element
comprising an antistatic layer of crystalling conductive tin
oxide. Among the possible binders for dispersing the
crystalline tin oxide is cited cellulose nitrate.This invention provides vanadium pentoxide
coating compositions, antistat layers applied from such
coating compositions and photographic elements having an
antistat layer wherein an amount of cellulose nitrate
polymer is added to the coating composition to stabilize
the vanadium pentoxide when dispersed in a solvent.
Chemicals such as cellulose triacetate that normally
cause the precipitation of vanadium pentoxide dispersions
do not have this effect in the presence of cellulose
nitrate. As a result, these dispersions can be roll
coated as antistatic layers on cellulose triacetate film
support without depositing specks of precipitated
material. Furthermore, the addition of relatively small
amounts of cellulose
