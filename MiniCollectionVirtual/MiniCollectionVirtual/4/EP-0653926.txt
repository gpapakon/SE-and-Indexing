<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a intrastromal corneal
ring ("ICR") comprising at least one outer layer of a
physiologically compatible polymer having a low modulus
of elasticity, which polymer may be hydratable and may be
hydrophilic. The inner portion of the ICR may be hollow
or may contain one or more physiologically compatible
polymers.Anomalies in the overall shape of the eye can
cause visual disorders. Hyperopia ("farsightedness")
occurs when the front-to-back distance in the eyeball is
too short. In such a case, parallel rays originating
greater than 610 cm (20 feet) from the eye focus behind the
retina. In contrast, when the front-to-back distance of
eyeball is too long, myopia ("nearsightedness") occurs
and the focus of parallel rays entering the eye occurs in
front of the retina. Astigmatism is a condition which
occurs when the parallel rays of light do not focus to a
single point within the eye, but rather have a variable
focus due to the fact that the cornea is aspherical and
refracts light in a different meridian at different
distances. Some degree of astigmatism is normal, but
where it is pronounced, the astigmatism must be
corrected.Hyperopia, myopia, and astigmatism are usually
corrected by glasses or contact lenses. Surgical methods
for the correction of such disorders are known. Such
methods include radial keratotomy (see, e.g., U.S. 
Patents Nos. 4,815,463 and 4,688,570) and laser corneal
ablation (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,941,093).Another method for correcting those disorders
is through the implantation of polymeric rings in the
eye's corneal stroma to change the curvature of the
cornea. Previous work involving the implantation of
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) rings, allograft corneal
tissue, and hydrogels is well documented. One of the
ring devices involves a split ring design which is
inserted into a channel previously dissected in the
stromal layer of the cornea. A minimally invasive
incision is used both for producing the channel and for
implanting the implant.The use of ICRs made completely of certain
hard, hydrophobic polymers is known. For instance, in
the article
Hartmann Chr., et al.,
"Intrastromal Implantation Eines Justierbaren
Kunststofforings Zur Hornhautrefraktionsanderung",
delivered by H. Freyler et al, Kongress der Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr
Intraokularlinsen Implantation (Mar. 1989)

rings of silicone, polymethylmethacrylate ("PMMA"), and
fluorocarbons ("TEFLON"). Other disclosures of the use
