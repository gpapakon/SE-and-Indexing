<ABSTRACT>
A low relief, artificial reef made of one or more threads of automobile tires (10) partially buried in a sedimentary bottom (12) and partially protruding above it. The artificial reef can be built on land and conveyed floating to the site of installment. It can also be built on a boat and dropped directly onto the water bottom.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SELF-ANCHORING TIRE-MADE ARTIFICIAL REEFBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe field of the present invention relates to tire-made artificial reefs which are placed on a water bottom for the enhancement of plant and animal aquatic life. Heretofore a variety of artificial reefs have been proposed and constructed. One type of artificial reef consists of a plurality of tires formed in pyramidal modules, the modules assembled together and secured by heavy weights on the water bottom. This type of reef is unsatisfactory because fastenings and moorings often loosen and break away under storms. In an offshore California experiment, such an artificial reef was constructed but resulted in tires being scattered on neighboring beaches.Another type of reef is made of a plurality of units consisting of tires partially embedded in concrete blocks. Such a construction is as much a concrete reef as a tire reef, with the correlative concrete reef disadvantages of weight, subsidence, expensiveness and lack of internal spaces.Henceforth, aquatic enhancement programs need a new type of artificial reef which is inexpensive, sea life productive and resistant to surge and storm. Also, the present inventor has recognized that it is desirable for the artificial reef to be 

advantageously constructed from old automobile tires which are free of cost, have a very long life span and provide excellent sea life habitats because of their extended internal and external surfaces. In the U.S.A., there are 200 million old tires which yearly add to the industrial waste. Changing the land's environmental nuisance of old tires into a sea benefit for marine plants and animals is an ecological recycling achievement.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is an artificial reef constructed of a network of tires built by assembling and fastening the tires together in a desired configuration. When deposited along a sedimentary water bottom, the lower part of the tire network buries itself automatically in the sediments becoming anchored while the upper part of it remains protruding above the sediment level becoming an aquatic life habitat.A preferable way to build the artificial reef of the invention is first to assemble threads of tires in a generally linear configuration and second to juxtapose or crisscross these threads to form the desired network. Juxtaposed or crisscrossed threads of tires may be interconnected and tied by fasteners. Also during the building process, tires should be cut to provide openings on their periphery so that air can

I CLAIM:
1. An artificial reef for aquatic habitat enhancement consisting of a low relief linear network of old tires, laying on a sandy bottom, embedded into water-made scours, anchored in retained shift sand, and protruding above the sand level, wherein said tires of the network are assembled and f stened in a position vertical to the water bottom, whereby aquatic animals and vegetals are provided with protruding cavities to shelter and with protruding internal and external surfaces to fix and to grow. 2. The artificial reef of Claim 1, wherein said tires of the network stand vertical in planes perpendicular between themselves.
3. The artificial reef of Claim 1, wherein said tires of the network stand from place to place vertically juxtaposed. 4. The artificial reef of Claim 1, wherein each tire of said network is an anchor into the sand.
5. The artificial reef of Claim 1, wherein each tire of said network is a protruding habitat comprising a cavity, an internal surface and an external surface. 6- The artificial reef of Claim 1, wherein the fasteners which assemble the tires are of different strength.
7. The artificial reef of Claim 1, wherein said tires of the network are further bound together by sessile vegetal and animal organisms which are artificially grown on these tires. 8. The artificial reef of Claim 1, wherein said tires of the network are artificial substrates whereon sessile vegetal and animal organisms are affixed and grown.
9. The artificial reef of Claim 1, wherein the tire- made reef, having the same density as tires, sinks below the water surface, lays on the water bottom and does not subside below the sand.
10. The artificial reef of Claim 1, wherein said network of tires adheres to the sandy bottom by means of multiple anchoring embedded tires. 11. The artificial reef of Claim 1, further including mooring lines vertically buried by a water jet in the sedimentary bottom with an anti-extraction device. 


 12. The artificial reef of Claim 1, as a means to stabilize the water bottom and control shoreline erosion.
13. A method to forward from land to sea an old tire- made artificial reef comprising the steps of: - Assembling on a beach a multiplicity of old tires in a linear network;
Launching said linear network in water where it floats because of the air trapped in the tires' upper cavities; - Towing with a boat the floating linear network up to the site at sea where it is due to be sunk.
