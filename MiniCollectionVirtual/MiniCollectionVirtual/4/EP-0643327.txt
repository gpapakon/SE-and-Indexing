disclosed, which is improved in anti-adhesion in a high humid 

condition. The light-sensitive material comprises a support 
having thereon a photographic component layer, which comprises 

a silver halide emulsion layer and optionally a hydrophilic 
colloid layer in which the silver halide emulsion layer 

comprises silver halide grains having a silver chloride 
content of not less than 90 mol % and the outermost layer 

provided at the position farthest from the surface of the 
support of said photographic layer contains a fluorinated 

cationic surfactant represented by formula I; 

wherein R₂ is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 5 
carbon atoms; R₃, R₄ and R₅ are each independently a hydrogen 

atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms or a 
hydroxyalkyl group; X⁻ is Br⁻, Cl⁻, CH₃SO₃⁻, CH₃-C₆H₄-SO₃⁻, 

CH₃COO⁻, NO₃⁻ or C₆H₅-SO₃⁻; n is an integer of 1 to 10; m is an 
integer of 1 to 6; ℓ is 0 or 1; and k is an integer of 0 to 5, 

provided that k is not 0 when ℓ is 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic 
light-sensitive material and particularly to the physical 
surface property improvements, under a highly humid 
conditions, on a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material having a silver halide emulsion layer containing 
silver chloride or a silver halide having a silver chloride 
content of not less than 90 mol%. In a silver halide photographic light-sensitive material, 
a hydrophilic binder principally comprising gelatin is applied 
to a photographic component layer such as a light-sensitive 
layer, an intermediate layer and a protective layer. The 
above-mentioned hydrophilic binder principally comprising 
gelatin is excellent in dispersibility of silver halide grains 
and couplers and, at the same time, also excellent in  
 
industrial productivity of, for example, a simultaneous 
multilayer coating. Usually, the above-mentioned hydrophilic binder 
principally comprising gelatin is cross-linked by a crosslinking 
agent, so that the layer strength can be increased. 
However, there has been such a problem that photographic 
component layers such as a light-sensitive layer, an 
intermediate layer and a protective layer are liable to be 
affected by moisture, because the above-mentioned binder is 
intrinsically hydrophilic, that is to say, for example, such a 
problem is raised that, when the photographic component layer 
is put in highly humid conditions, silver halide photographic 
light-sensitive materials may adhere to each other. As for the measures for improving a physical surface 
property under highly humid conditions, U.S. Patent No. 
4,426,431 and Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public 
Inspection (hereinafter referred to as JP OPI Publication) 
Nos.62-264043/1987 and 3-212640/1991 describe respectively 
that a light-sensitive material is developed and dried, and a 
protective coated-layer is additionally provided to the top of 
a protective layer. In the above-mentioned measures, however, not only an 
additional protective coated-layer has to be provided with the 
increase of the production load after completing a developing 
step, but also any problems raised before development cannot 
be solved.  JP OPI Publication Nos. 48-101118/1973, 58-200235/1983, 
60-128434/1985 and 2-12145/1990 describe respectively of the 
attempts for improving a slidability, static chargeability and 
coatability, by applying a cationic fluorine type surfactant 
to a silver halide photographic light-sensitive material. When a silver iodobromide
