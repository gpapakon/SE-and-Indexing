<ABSTRACT>
A diagnostic or control composition is useful to characterize or control insects and comprises a nucleotide sequence coding for juvenile hormone esterase (JHE). The coding sequence may be combined with a promoter sequence regulating the transcription thereof in a recombinant expression vector for use in controlling insects having a juvenile hormone esterase dependency. Preferred embodiments of the invention are recombinant baculoviruses in which a mutated JHE coding sequence provides relatively rapid speed of kill in insects.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INSECT DIAGNOSTIC AND CONTROL COMPOSITIONSField of the InventionThe present invention relates to uses of nucleotide sequences coding for juvenile hormone esterase, and more particularly to recombinant expression vectors including juvenile hormone esterase or mutant coding sequences having uses such as in controlling insects.This invention was made with Government support under NIH Grant No. ES-02710, NSF Grant No. DCB-85-18697 and USDA Grant No. 85-CRCR-1-1715.Background of the InventionThe lepidopteran family noctuidae includes some of the most destructive agricultural pests, such as the genera Heliothis, Helicoverpa, Spodoptera and Trichoplusia . For example, included in this family are the tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens) , the cotton leafworm (Alabama argillacea) , the spotted cutworm (Amathes c-nigrum) , the glassy cutworm ( Crymodes devastator) , the bronzed cutworm(Nephelodes emmedonia) , the fall armyworm (Laphygma frugiperda) , the beet armyworm ( Spodoptera exigua) and the variegated cutworm (Peridroma saucia) . Juvenile hormone esterase is responsible for the stage-specific metabolism of juvenile hormone in such insects.Juvenile hormone and juvenile hormone esterase have been studied extensively in the Lepidoptera. In the final larval growing stage of these insects, there is a rapid decline in the juvenile hormone titer which initiates the physiological and behavioral events preceding pupation and adult development. This decline in the juvenile hormone titer appears to be regulated by an increase in degradation by juvenile hormone esterase as well as a reduction of biosynthesis. Juvenile hormone esterase activity is very low in the early stadia of larval growth. Even at the peak activity levels in the blood of the final stadium, the concentration of juvenile hormone esterase has 

been estimated at less than 0.1 percent of the total protein. Yet the enzyme has a high affinity for juvenile hormone.The initial reduction in juvenile hormone titer in the last larval stadium initiates a sequence of events leading to pupation. Powerful and selective chemical inhibitors of juvenile hormone esterase have been used in vivo to demonstrate the developmental consequences of blocking the activity of juvenile hormone esterase. For example, a group of the chemical inhibitors of juvenile hormone esterase are the trifluoromethylketone sulfides, as described by U.S. Patent 4,562,292, issued December 31, 1985, inventors Hammock et al . Treatment in the final larval stadium of the tomato hornworm (Manduca
