<ABSTRACT>
The process comprises allowing the suspension to flow as a feed stream through a narrow channel or a capillary and to take off part-streams from the wall at the periphery of the channel or the capillary through orifices in the channel wall or the capillary wall, the cross-section of which is greater than the mean particle diameter (median value), in comparison to the feed stream, the particle concentration being enriched in the main stream and diluted in the part-streams. The apparatus comprises a tube or channel in which the main stream is conducted being provided, uniformly distributed over the periphery, with a plurality of boreholes or (in the case of a channel) with two gaps. The diameter of the boreholes is between 10% and 90% of the tube diameter and the gap width is between 10% and 30% of the channel width.

Process for concentrating suspended particles in a
liquid, characterised in that the suspension is caused

to flow as a feed scream (6) through a narrow channel
or a capillary (1) having a gap width or a diameter of

0.5 µm to 10 mm, preferably 10 µm to 10 mm, and at the
circumference of the channel or capillary (1) partial

streams are abstracted from the channel wall or
capillary wall through openings in the latter whose

gap width or diameter is greater than the median value
of the particle size distribution of the feed stream

(6), the particle concentration in the main stream
being enriched compared to the feed stream (6) and in

the partial streams being depleted compared to the
feed stream (6) on account of the decreasing particle

concentration in the feed stream (6) in the vicinity
of the wall.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the partial stream in the vicinity of the wall having

a direction component opposite to the main stream is
abstracted preferably at a deflection angle of between

120° and 150°.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that turbulent flow conditions prevail in the main

stream.
Process according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that laminar flow conditions exist in the partial

streams.
Process according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the partial stream abstracted from the openings

of the same axial height comprises 2% to 10%,
preferably 4% to 7%, of the main stream. 
Process according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that partial streams are abstracted in succession in a

cascade-like manner in the flow direction, and in each
case at the same axial height.
Process according to claim 6, characterised in that
the partial streams abstracted from different axial

heights are removed separately in order to obtain
partial streams of different particle concentration

and different size distribution of the particles.
Process according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in
that the sum of all partial streams comprises up to

99% of the feed stream (6).
Process according to claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that particles and liquid are separated from one

another during an ongoing chemical reaction.
Apparatus for concentrating suspended particles in a
liquid, according to the process according to claims 1

to 5, characterised in that in a capillary (1) having
a diameter of 0.5 µm to 10 mm, preferably 10 µm to

10 mm, through which the suspension (6) to be
concentrated is fed as a main stream, a plurality,

preferably 3 to 6 bores having diameters of between
10% and 90%, preferably between 40% and 70% of the

capillary diameter, are arranged at the same axial
height on the circumference in order to abstract

partial streams.
Apparatus for concentrating suspended particles in a
liquid, according to the process according to claims 1

to 5, characterised in that in a plane channel of
rectangular cross-section having a gap width of 0.5 µm 

to 10 mm, preferably 10 µm to 10 mm, through which the
suspension to be concentrated is fed as a main stream,

two gaps having gap widths of between 5% and 50%,
preferably between 10% and 30% of the channel width,

are provided at the same axial height on opposite
walls in order to abstract partial streams.
Apparatus according to claim 10 or 11, characterised
in that the bores or gaps for abstracting particle-depleted

partial streams have a diameter or a gap
width of 2 to 10 times, preferably 2 to 5 times, the

median value of the particle size distribution of the
feed stream (6).
Apparatus according to claims 10 to 12 for carrying
out the process according to claims 6 to 8,

characterised in that a plurality, preferably 20 to 40
such bore or gap systems (5n) are arranged in

succession in a cascade-like manner in the flow
direction.
Apparatus according to claims 10 to 12, characterised
in that the total cross-section of the openings at the

same axial height is 0.5 to 4 times, preferably 1 to 2
times that of the channel or capillary cross-section.
