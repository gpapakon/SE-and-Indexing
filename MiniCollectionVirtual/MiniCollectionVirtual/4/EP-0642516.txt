<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel chemical compound having
immunomodulatory activity, and in particular to a macrolide immunosuppressant.
More particularly, the invention relates to a semisynthetic analog of ascomycin,
pharmaceutical compositions containing such compound and methods of treatment
employing the same.The compound cyclosporine (cyclosporin A) has found wide use since its introduction
in the fields of organ transplantation and immunomodulation, and has brought about a
significant increase in the success rate for transplantation procedures. Unsatisfactory side-effects
associated with cyclosporine, however, such as nephrotoxicity, have led to a continued
search for immunosuppressant compounds having improved efficacy and safety.Recently, several classes of macrocyclic compounds having potent immunomodulatory
activity have been discovered. Okuhara et al., in European Patent Application No. 184162,
published June 11, 1986, disclose a number of macrocyclic compounds isolated from the
genus Streptomyces. Immunosuppressant FK-506, isolated from a strain of S. tsukubaensis,
is a 23-membered macrocyclic lactone represented by formula 1a, below. Other related natural
products, such as FR-900520 (1b) and FR-900523 (1c), which differ from FK-506 in their
alkyl substituent at C-21, have been isolated from S. hygroscopicus yakushimnaensis. Yet
another analog, FR-900525, produced by S. tsukubaensis, differs from FK-506 in the
replacement of a pipecolic acid moiety with a proline group.FR-900520, also known as ascomycin, has been previously disclosed by Arai et al. in
U.S. Patent No. 3,244,592, issued April 5, 1966, where the compound is described as an
antifungal agent Monaghan, R.L., et al ., on the other hand, describe the use of ascomycin as
an immunosuppressant in European Patent Application No. 323865, published July 12, 1989.Although the immunosuppressive activity of FK-506 has been clinically confirmed,
toxicity in mammals has limited its utility. The activity of FK-506 has, however, prompted
efforts to discover novel analogs of FK-type compounds which possess superior properties.
These efforts include the isolation of new fermentation products, the microbial transformation
of existing chemical entities, the chemical modification of these macrocycles, and the synthesis
of hybrid species derived from smaller synthetic fragments. 
Fermentation products of FK-type compounds include C-21-epi derivatives of FK-506;
a 31-demethylated derivative of FK-506; 31-oxo-FK-506; and compounds derived from
FK
