<ABSTRACT>
A sheet feeder according to the invention comprises 
a housing (100) provided with a sheet accommodation space in 

which a plurality of sheets are to be stacked and held; 
a separation plate (11) which is arranged against the forward 

edge of the sheets held in the housing and whose surface 
in contact with the forward edge of the sheets is 

substantially perpendicular to the sheet face; a feed 
roller (1), arranged close to the separation plate, for feeding 

the uppermost one of the sheets held in the housing in 
the forward direction while in contact with the face of 

that sheet; and pressurizing means (9,10) for applying pressure 
to the sheets toward the feed roller. The separation 

plate has a tapered face (11a) at its forward end inclined in 
the sheet feeding direction, so that the forward edge of 

the top sheet in contact with the feed roller run against 
the tapered face. This arrangement facilitates separation 

of the top sheet from the next even if the sheets are 
thicker than usual because the top sheet, as its forward 

edge runs against the tapered face, slides down in the 
sheet feeding direction. The close position of the feed 

roller to the separation plate causes the face of the 
top shee
t, while it is being fed, to be firmly in contact 
with the tapered face of the separation plate and thereby 

prevents the forward edge of the next sheet from going 
over the tapered face.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet feeder for 
feeding sheets one by one, and more particularly to a 
sheet feeder capable of feeding not only ordinary paper 
sheets of A4 and B4 sizes but also relatively thick sheets 
such as postal cards or postcards. Conventional sheet feeders for printers or facsimile 
apparatuses, which feed sheets of document or recording 
paper after separating them one by one, are classified into 
two types, one using a separation roller or a separation 
belt besides a feed roller and the other using separation 
claws provided on a hopper in which a plurality of sheets 
are stacked. The former separates one of sheets stacked in a 
sheet tray by pressing front edges of the sheets with 
the separation roller which turns at low speed in the 
direction reverse to the feed roller, or by pressing the 
front edges with the separation belt having a high friction 
coefficient. However, as the thickness of sheets to be 
fed is considered in determining the position of the 
separation rollers or belt, variations of the thickness  
 
tends to invite sticking of two sheets (separation error) 
or jamming. Moreover, there is another disadvantage that 
stacking of many (for instance more than 30) sheets 
deteriorates the accuracy of sheet separation, and a 
configuration to prevent this deterioration is required. On the other hand,the latter, the type of sheet feeder 
using a hopper provided with separation claws, will not be 
prevented from adequate separation even if many sheets are 
stacked in the hopper. FIG. 1 shows a perspective view of 
a part of such a sheet feeder, and FIG. 2, an A-A cross 
section of the sheet feeder of FIG. 1. In the diagrams, 
a plurality of sheets 50 are stacked in a hopper 25, and 
the top sheet is fed in the direction of arrow C by the 
rotation of feed rollers 21. The sheets 50 are pressed 
by a back-up plate 23 and springs 24 against the feed 
rollers 21, and in this state separation claws 22 hold 
the corners of the sheets 50. As the feed rollers 21 
rotate to feed a sheet 50, the separation claws 22 
restrain the forward edge of the sheet to curve the sheet 
as shown by the broken line in FIG. 2, and eventually the 
curved part is driven by the sheet's own firmness to go 
over the separation claws 22, resulting in the separation 
of that top sheet. The sheet feeder illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, 
however, whose stability of separation is determined by 
the correlation between the sheet thickness and the square  
 
measure of the separation, claws 22 and

<CLAIMS>
A sheet feeder for separating and feeding a plurality 
of sheets one by one, comprising; 

   a housing provided with a sheet accommodation space 
in which the plurality of sheets are to be stacked and 

held; 
   a separation plate which is arranged against the 

forward edge of the sheets held in said housing and whose 
surface in contact with the forward edge of said sheets 

is substantially perpendicular to the faces of said sheets; 
   a feed roller, arranged close to said separation plate, 

for feeding the uppermost one of the sheets held in said 
housing in the forward direction while in contact with the 

face of that sheet; and 
   pressurizing means for applying pressure to said 

sheets toward said feed roller; 
   wherein said separation plate has a tapered face at 

its forward end inclined in the sheet feeding direction, 
so that the forward edge of said top sheet run against 

the tapered face. 
A sheet feeder, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
center axis of said feed roller is positioned within 20 mm 

from the extension surface of said separation plate which 
comes into contact with said forward edge of the sheet in 

 
a direction perpendicular to that face, and said tapered 

face is inclined by 20 to 40 degrees along the sheet 
feeding direction against the surface with which the 

forward edge of said sheet comes into contact. 
A sheet feeder, as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said 
pressurizing means has a pressurizing plate in contact 

with said sheet face and springs to press said pressurizing 
plate toward said feed roller. 
A sheet feeder, as claimed in Claim 3, wherein said 
housing includes means to press said pressurizing plate 

in the direction to compress said springs and a space into 
which said pressuirzing plate being so pressed can escape 

from said sheet accommodation space. 
A sheet feeder, as claimed in Claim 4, wherein said 
means to press said pressuirzing plate is a rotary cover 

supported by said housing.
