<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous liposome system contains, where appropriate besides a non-toxic organic solvent, at least one phospholipid and at least one other non-phospholipid substance which is a bile acid, a bile acid salt, a bile acid derivative and/or a salt of a bile acid derivative. The ratio of the phospholipid to the other non-phospholipid substance varies between 1:0.001 and 1:0.1 by weight. A process for preparing the liposome system provides for initial dissolution or dispersion of the phospholipid with the at least one other non-phospholipid substance in a ratio of 1:0.001 to 1:0.1 by weight in an organic solvent, subsequent concentration of the solution or dispersion, and then addition of water to form the liposome system.
