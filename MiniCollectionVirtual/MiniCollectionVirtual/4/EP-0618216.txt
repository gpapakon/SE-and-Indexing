<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to 1-N-alkylaminoisomaltitol of the formula I   
<

>
 where R can be a branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated C8-C21 alkyl group, and mixtures of 1-N-alkylaminoisomaltitol of the formula I with 1-N-alkylamino-1-deoxy-3-O- alpha -glucopyranosylglycerol and/or 1-N-alkylamino-1-deoxysorbitol or -mannitol and 1-N-alkylamino-1-deoxyglycerol, where the alkyl group has the meaning as in formula I, process for the preparation of the products and the use of the products as hydrophilic wetting agents, emulsifiers or detergent substances, especially in cosmetic and industrial cleaners.

<CLAIMS>
Mixtures of 1-N-alkylamino-1-desoxy-6-0-[α-D-glucopyranosyl]-D-sorbitol 

and 1-N-alkylamino-1-desoxy-6-0-[α-D-glucopyranosyl]-D-mannitol, 

which also have 
the following general Formula I designated as 1-N-alkylaminoisomalt: 


 
in which R means a branched or unbranched, saturated or 

unsaturated C-
8
 to C-
21
 alkyl group, with 1-N-alkyl-amino-1-desoxy-3-0-α-glucopyranosyl-glycerol 
of the 

Formula II 

 
and, if appropriate, with 1-N-alkylamino-1-desoxy-sorbitol 

or 1-N-alkylamino-1-desoxy-mannitol and 1-N-alkylamino-1-desoxy-glycerol, 
with the alkyl group 

having the meaning as in Formula I. 
Method for preparing a stereo-isomeric mixture 
from 1-N-alkylamino-1-desoxy-6-0-[α-D-glucopyranosyl]
-D-sorbitol 
and 1-N-alkylamino-1-desoxy-6-0-[α-D-glucopyranosyl]
-D-mannitol, 
which also has the 

following general Formula I designated as 1-N-alkylaminoisomalt: 

  
 

in which R means a branched or unbranched, saturated or 
unsaturated C-
8
 to C-
21
 alkyl group, or from mixtures 
of 1-N-alkylaminoisomalt of Formula I with 1-N-alkyl-amino-1-desoxy-3-0-α-glucopyranosyl-glycerol 

of Formula 
II, 


 
and/or with 1-N-alkylamino-1-desoxy-sorbitol or 1-N-alkylamino-1-desoxy-mannitol 

and 1-N-alkylamino-1-desoxy-glycerol, 
with the alkyl group having the 

meaning as in Formula I, characterised in that 
isomaltulose having N-alkylamines or mixtures of N-alkylamines, 

in which the alkyl group has the same 
meaning as in Formula I, is reductively aminated with 

metal catalysts and hydrogen in aqueous or aqueousalcoholic 
solution. 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the raw product is separated by means of 

chromatographic methods. 
Method in accordance with one of the claims 2 
to 3, characterised in that an excess of 0.5 to 5 mole, 

preferably 2 to 4 mole, of isomaltulose with respect to 
the alkylamine is used. 
Method in accordance with one of the claims 2 
to 4, characterised in that 0.5 to 10 % by weight of 

products of Formula I are added to the reaction 
mixture. 
Method in accordance with one of the claims 2 
to 5, in which the aminated products are dissociated 

from non-aminated products by means of electrodialysis. 
Use of the mixtures in accordance with claim 1 
as hydrophilic wetting agents, emulsifiers or surface-active  

 
substances, in particular in cosmetic or 

technical cleansing agents.
