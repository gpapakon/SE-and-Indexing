<ABSTRACT>
Crash-helmet (1) of the type provided with a front-piece (6), in 
which said front-piece (6) is made of rigid material and is jut-fixed to 

the usual connection side pins (3) of the visor (2) by means of cogs 
(8), the latter being partly deformable and so sized as to permit the 

prompt detachment of the front-piece (6) from said helmet pins (3) in 
case of fall of the user and/or his hitting against obstacles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is a crash-helmet for 
motorcyclists, cyclists and the like, provided in the 
front part of a front-piece having virtually the form 
of a jutting top of rigid material. As known, crash-helmets in general, and in particular 
the integral ones for motorcyclists and the like have 
in some cases, besides a visor of transparent material, 
also a small top, called front-piece, projecting almost 
horizontally with respect to the helmet and stably 
fixed above the visor, and whose function is that of 
protecting the open front of the helmet from sun rays. 
The present front-pieces are made of elastically deformable 
or soft material, in order to permit their deformation 
in case of fall of the user or of his hitting 
against obstacles, without causing damages to said 
user; in fact, it is well known that, for safety reasons, 
crash-helmets, either the integral ones or the 
so-called "jet" ones, i.e. having an open front, must 
not have any rigid element projecting from the cap, as 
in case of anomalous stresses this element would cause 
the helmet to rotate, with severe troubles and dangers 
for the user. The present front-piece or soft or anyhow deformable  
 
material, being rigidly fixed to the front of the 
helmet, solve only partly the problem of safety in case 
of fall or frontal hitting, inasmuch, even though 
their maximum projection reduces through deformation, 
they still are a projecting element, rigidly integral 
with the cap, which may cause damages to the user in 
case of fall or hitting, ensuing from possible shifts 
and/or partly rotations of the helmet with respect to 
its correct position. Besides, front-pieces of soft 
material are subject to vibrations during the driving 
which may create troubles to the user. EP-A-0479407 (SHOEI KABUSHIKI KAISHA) discloses a 
helmet including a cap body, a shield plate (or visor) 
and an adjustable front-piece which is attached to the 
cap body by means of machine screws passed through each 
of mounting holes provided in each of left and right 
opposite ends of the front-piece and threadedly engaged 
into nuts provided in the cap body. Object of this invention is therefore the realization 
of a crash-helmet provided with a front-piece designed 
and structurated in such a way as to fully avert the 
drawbacks caused by the known front-piece of soft or 
deformable material, and especially suitable to ensure  
 
the utmost safety in case of fall of the user or of 
hitting against possible obstacles. A further object of this

<CLAIMS>
Crash-helmet of the type provided with a front-piece 
(6) made of rigid material and jut-fixed to the connection 

side pins (3) of a visor (2) by means of means 
cogs, characterized in that said means cogs are partly 

deformable and are constituted by a plurality of elements 
shaped as stepped-teeth or teeth (8), radially 

projecting towards the inside of two circular openings 
(7), each of said openings being provided at the opposite 

ends of the front-piece (6), in such a way as to be 
arrangeable coaxially to one of said connection pins 

(3), the holding of said front-piece being obtained by 
the partial fitting of said teeth into an annular 

housing, defined, in correspondence of each connection 
pin (3), between the usual head (3a) of said pins and 

the annular body (4) utilized for the rotatably holding 
of the liftable visor (2), so as to permit the prompt 

detachment of the front piece (6) from said helmet pins 
(3) in case of fall and/or hitting against obstacles. 
Crash-helmet according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said teeth (8) are integral with the front-piece 

(6) and spaced from this by means of a peduncle-shaped 
part (8a) of smaller section, so as to allow the front-piece, 

in case of hittings or fall of the helmet user, 
to cause the coming out of the teeth (8) from the 

relevant annular holding housings and the ensuing its  
 

detachment from the helmet cap, as a consequence of the 
deformation undergone by said smaller section peduncles. 
Crash-helmet according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said front-piece is made of rigid material, such 

as plastic material, and can be applied both to integral 
type helmets for motorcyclists and to open-front 

helmets for motorcyclists and the like.
