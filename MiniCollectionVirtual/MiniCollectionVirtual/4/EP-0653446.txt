<ABSTRACT>
A vinyl copolymer is provided comprising a 
silanol group - containing (meth)acryl siloxane 

unit of formula (1): 

wherein R¹ is hydrogen or methyl, R², R³, and R⁴ 
are independently a monovalent C₁-C₈ hydrocarbon 

group or a siloxy group, R⁵ is a monovalent C₁- C₈ 
hydrocarbon group, n = 1 to 12, and a = 0 or 1. 

The vinyl copolymer is prepared by copolymerizing 
a polymerizable vinyl monomer with a silanol 

group-containing (meth)acryl siloxane in the 
presence of a radical initiator or by emulsion 

polymerizing a polymerizable vinyl monomer with 
a silanol group-containing (meth)acryl siloxane 

in an aqueous medium in the presence of a 
surfactant and a polymerization initiator. The 

copolymer is blended with a condensation 
catalyst to form a room temperature curable 

resin composition which crosslinks in the 
presence of moisture into a cured coating having 

weatherability, flexibility, and adherence.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to vinyl copolymers having
a silanol group in a side chain, and preferably to
silanol group-containing vinyl copolymers which offer a
room temperature curable resin composition e.g. of one-pack
type, which crosslink in the presence of moisture
into a cured coating, desirably having weatherability,
flexibility, and adherence and thus suitable as a coating
agent. It also relates to methods for preparing such
copolymers and room-temperature-curable resin compositions
containing such copolymers.In the prior art, acrylic urethane resins,
acrylic silicone resins, and fluorinated resins
are known as useful resins for paint, especially
in room temperature
curable coating compositions having 
weatherability. Among these resins, acrylic
urethane resins are less expensive, but
are made using isocyanates which are
harmful to the human body. Fluorinated resins
have weatherability, but are expensive. In
contrast, acrylic silicone resins are
in increasing demand because of a good
compromise between performance and cost.Acrylic silicone resins have an
alkoxysilyl group attached to an acrylic
backbone. They can form
stable cured coatings when applied to substrates
because alkoxysilyl groups react with moisture
in air at room temperature to produce siloxane
bonds. See Coating and Paint, No. 429, pages
55-64. An alkoxysilyl group can be introduced
into an acrylic backbone, for example, by
copolymerizing a polymerizable vinyl group-containing
silane compound in the presence of a
radical initiator as disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application Kokai (JP-A) No. 36109/1982.However, the conventional acrylic silicone
resins fail to impart as much weatherability as
fluorinated resins and are not flexible enough to
meet a wide variety of applications. There is a 
need for an acrylic silicone resin having these
properties.Most acrylic silicone
resins and compositions thereof are prepared with
organic solvent, contrary to
the current trend towards non-pollution
and resource saving. Known methods
for carrying out copolymerization in aqueous
media without using organic solvents include
emulsion polymerization and suspension
polymerization. With these methods, however,
desired hydrolysable groups such as
alkoxysilyl groups, react with water and
crosslink during copolymerization or storage,
leading to inconvenient thickening and gelation. A general aim herein is to provide new and useful
room-temperature curable resin compositions of an
acrylic-silicone type, methods of making the compositions
and their use in
