<ABSTRACT>
A field programmable, digital signal processing integrated circuit is formed in 
a semiconductor die and includes an array of arithmetic logic (ALU) circuits. A user 

programmable interconnect architecture is superimposed on the array of ALU 
circuits. One or more interface circuits comprising digital-to-analog (D/A) 

converters or analog-to-digital (A/D) converters are provided on the integrated 
circuit to interface to off-chip analog input signals and provide off-chip analog 

output signals. Circuitry is provided to program the interconnections between the 
interface circuits and the ALU circuits and between individual ones of the ALU 

circuits, as well as to define the specific functions of the individual ALU circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuits and, more specifically, to 
user-programmable integrated circuits. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to user-programmable mixed analog and digital integrated circuits. General purpose linear integrated circuits have limited themselves to 
specific functions such as operational amplifiers, phase locked loops, 
comparators, A/D converters, video amplifiers, transistor arrays, etc. These 
circuits form the building blocks of analog systems. Integrating these circuits into 
higher functions is difficult due to the need to employ external components (i.e., 
resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.) to determine their exact function. Thus once 
integrated, these circuits become specialized. In order to be practicable for design, 
manufacture, and sale, such a specialized part must have a large usage base. 
One illustrative example of such a circuit is an audio amplifier which may be used 
in stereo systems or television sets. Without a large usage base, the design 
and manufacture of such a circuit is not economical.  During the manufacture of analog circuits a significant cost is the final 
trimming of each individual circuit. This is required because component values 
vary as well as stray capacitance due to component placement.. Another common problem in electronics is that various parts of a complex 
signal need to be kept in phase while utilizing different circuit paths. This is 
commonly done in color television sets where the luminance information is routed 
through a delay line while the chrominance information is processed. Furthermore, many common analog systems such as television sets, VCR's 
and stereo systems are currently employing many digital functions. Hence the 
integration of these circuits onto a single integrated circuit die requires mixed 
analog and digital design and a process to manufacture them. The manufacturing 
process for such integrated circuits is complex and expensive as the transistors 
used in analog circuit design are typically radically different from those 
used in digital design. One prior-art approach to this problem has been to design circuits which 
operate employing digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. These devices use 
a microprocessor core to simulate the mathematical equivalent of the analog 
system. One common application for such chips is digital filtering of the 
signals before conversion back to the analog world. A fundamental limitation of these integrated DSP devices is that the
