<ABSTRACT>
An elongate expansible shaft (10) for a roll core has 
a peripheral surface (16) defining multiple separate 

elongate slots (20) helically intertwined and oriented at a 
pitch angle no greater than about 30° measured from a 

longitudinal axis (18). Each slot (20) is T-shaped in 
cross section and contains a respective separate, elongate, 

resilient bladder (28) pneumatically expandable into 
frictional engagement with the core. The bladder (28) has 

a unitary construction with hinge portions (32) for 
minimizing the loss of force due to expansion of the 

bladder. An air inlet fitting (56) is inserted in one end 
of each bladder (28) and is independently connected to a 

respective separate valve (82) for preventing the escape of 
air from the bladder irrespective of the air pressure in 

any other bladder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pneumatically 
expansible shaft assembly for insertion into a paper roll 
core or other sheet roll core. During manufacture of paper or other sheet 
products, the sheet material is typically wound onto, or 
unwound from, a tubular core supported by a diametrically 
expansible shaft insertable into the core and expanded to 
grip the core frictionally. Most conventional expansible 
roll core shafts employ a large number of relatively 
small, separate core-engaging elements expansible by a 
common internal air-expandable bladder. However, an 
increasingly popular type of shaft has straight, parallel 
slots cut longitudinally in its periphery in which are 
mounted respective straight, separate, air-expandable, 
resilient bladders overlain by respective straight core-contacting 
elements which extend throughout the length of 
the shaft. This type of shaft is exemplified by U.S. 
Patent No. 3,904,144. In this latter type of shaft, frictional torque 
transmission between the shaft and the core for driving 
or braking is dependent upon the total contact area 
between the core and the straight core-contacting 
elements on the shaft, as well as the air pressure. 
However, merely increasing the total number of straight, 
longitudinal slots in the shaft periphery to increase the 
number, and thus the area, of the core-contacting elements 
causes a significant decrease in the beam strength 
of the shaft. Accordingly, the amount of contact area 
obtainable with straight longitudinal slots and core-contacting 
elements is significantly restricted. Also, the elastomeric nature of the separate 
expandable bladders in the slots subtracts from the 
contact force transferred from the air pressure within 
the bladders, due to resilient resistance as the bladders  
 
expand, further restricting the frictional torque 
transmission between the shaft and the core. It has been found advantageous in the past to 
provide independent valves for the separate bladders to 
prevent each bladder from losing pressure as a result of 
a leak in another bladder, so that the core remains frictionally 
engaged with the shaft despite such leak, as 
shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,904,144. However, the loss of 
pressure in a single straight, longitudinally oriented 
bladder can change the axial relationship between the 
shaft and core which can adversely affect certain 
converting operations. Alternatively, using separate, 
independently valved annular bladders, as shown in FIG. 7 
of U.S. Patent No. 3,904,144, causes an

An expansible shaft assembly for insertion 
into a core, comprising: 


(a) a shaft having a longitudinally-extending 
peripheral surface and a longitudinal 

axis, said surface defining multiple 
longitudinally-extending separate slots; 
(b) each of said slots containing a respective 
elongate resilient separate bladder 

expandable under fluid pressure to create 
frictional engagement with said core; 

characterized by 
(c) the respective separate slots and bladders 
extending longitudinally along said shaft 

in a substantially helically intertwined 
relationship with each other.

wherein each of said slots is oriented at a pitch angle 

no greater than about 30° measured from said longitudinal 
axis.

wherein each bladder has a separate fluid inlet valve 

associated therewith for preventing the escape of 
pressurized fluid therefrom irrespective of the fluid 

pressure in another bladder. 
The expansible shaft assembly of claim 1 
wherein said slots and bladders are T-shaped in cross 

section. 
The expansible shaft assembly of claim 1

portion extending from said wide portion toward said 

peripheral surface, and wherein each of said bladders has 
a T-shaped cross section matingly inserted in a
