<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a combustion process and a combustion chamber in which the combustion of the gaseous fuel takes place on the combustion surface of a porous body (1; 17; 18) by virtue of the gaseous fuel being brought into contact, on said surface, with the oxidant air. The invention is characterised in that, before coming into contact with the gaseous fuel, the oxidant air passes through the porous body (1; 17; 18). The advantage of the invention consists in the possibility of burning gases charged with ashes and dusts without the risk of blocking the very fine pores of the porous body (1; 17; 18), while profiting from the known advantages of combustion on a porous body, namely the reduction of nitrogen oxides and of carbon monoxide contained in the combustion gases (smoke).
