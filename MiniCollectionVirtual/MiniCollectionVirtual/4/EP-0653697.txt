<ABSTRACT>
A mouse cursor is used to selectively subject an object displayed 
on a screen (3) to one of a plurality of operations with a minimum number 

of steps. 
Positioning the first pointing spot of a multiple point cursor with 
respect to an object and clicking a mouse button (9a, 9b) designates, for 

example, the first process, namely, the transfer operation of the object. 
In response to the clicking of the mouse cursor after the transfer of the 

cursor, the transfer operation is performed such that the object in the 
original position is deleted and a designated object appears in the 

current cursor position. The second position of the multiple cursor is 
then positioned by clicking the mouse cursor with respect to the object 

so as to designate the copying operation of the object. In response to 
the clicking of the button after transferring the cursor, the copying 

operation is performed such that the designated object appears at the 
current position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to data processing systems
having a display and a pointing device such as a mouse or a track ball,
and more particularly to a data processing system in which a pointing
device indicates an object displayed on a display and performs a
predetermined operation on the object.Conventionally, with a computer system having a graphic user
interface (GUI), it has been common to perform a predetermined operation
such as execution of a program associated with the icon, and expansion
and transfer of a window by positioning a mouse cursor on an object
displayed on a display such as an icon, a graph, a window frame, or a
character to click, double click, or drag a mouse button.Along with the complication of GUI application programs, operations
that should be performed on an object on a display have become
diversified. To cope with the diversification of such operation, an
attempt is made in the prior art to improve the user interface and to
improve the efficiency of the operation.PUPA 59-163666 discloses a graphic generator using multiple cursors
which forms a cursor area in an area surrounding part of a graphic
pattern, transfers in a voluntary direction a graphic surrounded by the
cursor area, and further adds or contracts the graphic along with the
transfer of the graphic.PUPA 62-11927 discloses a calculator using an icon for display and
selection of functions in which the functions possessed by each icon, its
position on the screen, the icon shape, and menu data displayed when an
icon is displayed are stored and controlled to display the content of
menu data when an icon for controlling the cursor display is selected.PUPA 62-259129 discloses the provision of an indication means for
indicating voluntary two pointing spots with a relative distance
therebetween on a tablet and cursor control means for transferring a
graphic cursor displayed on a display following the transfer of the
graphic cursor between the two pointing spots as well as change of the
size of graphic cursor in response to the pressing down of a
predetermined button. PUPA 2-166506 discloses an information input apparatus that
displays a cursor on a position on a display screen of a display in
response to the operation of a pointing device, the cursor serving as a
shape for representing the function of operation means.PUPA 4-34663 discloses the provision of a function for representing
the scope of an object to be selected with a cursor for selecting and
editing an object to be edited on a display, as well as
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A data processing system having a processor (103), a display (3)
coupled to the processor and a pointing device (9) coupled to the

processor such that movement of the pointing device results in
corresponding movement of a cursor on the screen of the display, the data

processing system comprising:

means for displaying a cursor having a plurality of pointing spots
on the screen of the display;
single indication means for instructing the processor to directly perform a
different operation on an object (1804) displayed on the screen for each

of said plurality of pointing spots when positioned on said object.
A data processing system as claimed in claim 1 wherein the pointing
device is a mouse having at least one button (9a).
A data processing system as claimed in claim 2 wherein the single
indication means for instructing the processor is a click operation on a

button of the mouse.
A data processing system as claimed in any of the preceding claims
wherein said plurality of pointing spots comprises a first and a second

pointing spot (P1, P2).
A data processing system as claimed any of the preceding claims
further comprising:


means for instructing the processor to register an object as a
first object (L1) to be processed when a first pointing spot (P1) is

positioned on that object on the screen; and
means for instructing the processor to register a different object
as a second object (L2) to be processed when a second pointing spot (P2)

is positioned on a different object from the first object; and
means responsive to the registration of the first object and the

second object for instructing the processor to perform a predetermined
operation which relates the first object to the second object.
A data processing system as claimed in any of the preceding claims
comprising:


means for associating each operation to be performed by the
processor with each of the pointing spots; and 
means for determining if any of the pointing spots is positioned on
an object displayed on the screen (117).
A data processing system as claimed in any of the preceding claims
comprising:

   means for performing a predetermined operation on a whole object
associated with all the multiple pointing spots in response to

registration of the object with respect to said multiple pointing spots.
A method of operating a data processing system having a processor
(103), a display (3) coupled to the processor and a pointing device (9)

coupled to the processor such that movement of the pointing device
results in corresponding movement of a cursor on the screen of the

display, the method comprising the steps of:

displaying a cursor having a plurality of pointing spots on the
screen of the display;
instructing the processor via a single indication means to directly perform
a different operation on an object (1804) displayed on the screen for

each of said plurality of pointing spots when positioned on said object.
