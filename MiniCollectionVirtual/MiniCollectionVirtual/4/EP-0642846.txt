<ABSTRACT>
Device for decontaminating the surface (3) of a material (2), attached to or deposited upon which are particles of any kind containing components of certain contaminants and requiring to be cleaned off: the device comprises at least one pulsed laser beam (1) projected by any means (13, 14) onto said surface (3) and chosen from a range of ultraviolet wavelengths from 190 to 360 nanometres; which cleaning device comprises a suction mouth (9) surrounding said laser beam (1) along its XX' axis and any means of moving the assembly relative to said surface (3) to be cleaned so that said laser beam (2) follows a given path in order to treat the surface, ejecting, as it goes, said particles torn off the surface by ablation in a cloud (7) above the surface, in which the optical emission is picked up and the intensity of the frequencies of the optical emissions of said components of certain contaminants is measured. One of the chief applications is decontaminating surfaces of premises, equipment, pipes, etc. contaminated by radio-elements or chemical elements.
