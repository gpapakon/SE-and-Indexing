<ABSTRACT>
An improved method and apparatus for preparing low-concentration polyaluminosilicate microgels from a water soluble silicate and an alkali metal aluminate in which the silicate and the aluminate are mixed at a rate to produce a Reynolds number of at least 4000, the mixture is aged and then diluted to a silica concentration of not more than 1.0 wt.%. The method achieves reduced silica deposition during the preparation of the microgels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method
for preparing low-concentration polyaluminosilicate microgels, i.e., aqueous solutions
having an active silica concentration of generally less than about 1.0 wt.%, which
are formed by the partial gelation of an alkali metal silicate or a polysilicate, such
as sodium polysilicate, having in its most common form one part Na2O to 3.3
parts SiO2 by weight, further modified by the
incorporation of aluminum oxide into their structure. The microgels, which are referred to as "active" silica in
contrast to commercial colloidal silica, comprise solutions of from 1 to 2 nm
diameter linked silica particles which have a surface area of at least about 1000
m2/g. The particles are linked together during preparation, i.e., during partial
gelation, to form aggregates which are arranged into three-dimensional networks
and chains. Such alumina modified
polysilicates are classified as polyaluaminosilicate microgels and are readily
produced by a modification of the basic method for polysilicate microgels. A
critical aspect of the invention is the ability to produce the microgels within a
reasonable time period, i.e., not longer than about 15 minutes until the microgel is
ready for use, without the risk of solidification and with minimum formation of
undesirable silica deposits within the processing equipment. In this connection,
the incorporation of alumina into the polysilicate microgel has been found
beneficial in that it increases the rate of microgel formation. Polyaluminosilicate
microgels produced according to the invention are particularly useful in
combinations with water soluble cationic polymers as a drainage and retention aid
in papermaking. At low pH values, below pH of 5, these products are more
appropriately referred to as polyaluminosilicic acid microgels. As the pH value is raised, 
these products can contain mixtures of polyaluminosilicic acid and polyaluminosilicate microgels;
the ratio being pH-dependent. For sake of convenience, these products hereinafter
will be referred to as polyaluminosilicate microgels.The present invention is an improved method for
continuously preparing a low-concentration polyaluminosilicate microgel which
comprises
a solution of from 1 to 2 non diameter silica particles having a surface area of
at least about 1000 m2/g which are listed together in individual chains to form
three dimensional network structures and comprises:
(a) simultaneously introducing a first stream comprising a water soluble silicate
solution and a second
