<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a high-performance target which involves the vapour deposition of thin layers onto substrates in vacuo, with heat input, while sacrificing the target, and to a process for producing such a target. According to the invention it is provided that   a.) the target material is embedded in a target support material which cannot be sputtered off and has high thermal conductivity, the intention being to remove the target material as completely as possible during sputtering, apart from a thin safety separation layer between target material and target support material, and b.) there is arranged, in the target support material, a cooling duct system in accordance with the shape of the target material.
