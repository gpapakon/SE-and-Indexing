<ABSTRACT>
A bridge-type primary switching circuit (12) is represented 
by a pulsed voltage source (VSW). The primary 

switched waveform is transformed to secondary circuit (14) 
using a transformer (T1) with the required turns ratio N and 

a center-tapped secondary winding (16). Half-bridge rectifier 
(18) formed by diodes (DR1) and (DR2) rectifies the 

secondary waveform and feeds the waveform through a low-pass 
filter (LF) and (CF) to obtain the desired DC output voltage. 

The snubber circuit (20) is represented by switch-diode-capacitor 
combinations (SA-DS1-CS1) and (SB-DS2-CS2) across 

each rectifier (DR1) and (DR2). Capacitances (CS1) and (CS2) 
are selected large enough such that their voltages remain 

essentially constant during a switching cycle. The controlled 
switches (SA) and (SB) are turned ON with a specific 

delay after the primary voltage reaches a magnitude close to 
the input voltage in order to allow the rectifier diodes 

(DR1) and (DR2) to be commutated. It is crucial that the 
switches (SA) and (SB) be turned OFF before the primary 

voltage collapses to zero to avoid current spikes through the 
switches.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a circuit for 
controlling voltage spikes and ringing during turn-off of 
half-bridge rectifiers in bridge-type pulse width modulated 
direct current - direct current (PWM DC-DC) converters. More 
particularly, it relates to such a circuit for controlling 
voltage spikes and ringing which redirects energy in a 
leakage inductance of a transformer to a load in a lossless 
manner using active switches. Most especially, it relates to 
such a circuit for controlling voltage spikes and ringing 
which permits use of lower voltage rectifiers and significantly  
 
reduces conduction losses. When output rectifiers of a PWM DC-DC converter with 
transformer isolation turn off, voltage spikes and high-frequency 
ringing are induced across the rectifier terminals 
due to the presence of leakage inductances in the transformer. 
The voltage spikes impose severe stresses on the 
rectifiers and force one to use higher voltage rectifiers, 
resulting in higher conduction losses. Traditionally, 
resistance - capacitance (R-C) or resistance - diode - 
capacitance (R-D-C) snubber circuits are used across the 
rectifiers to limit the voltage spikes. The capacitance 
chosen in an R-C or R-D-C snubber is usually much larger than 
the junction capacitance of the rectifier, so that the 
majority of the leakage inductor current is diverted through 
the snubber, resulting in a smaller voltage overshoot. The 
resistor provides necessary damping to reduce ringing, but it 
dissipates energy. The energy stored in the capacitors has 
to be redirected to the load each cycle when the rectifier 
turns on. This introduces additional losses in the resistor 
unless a diode is used across it (R-D-C). Tradeoffs are 
usually necessary in the choice of R and C values, since a 
large capacitance reduces voltage spikes while increasing the 
power dissipation, and a smaller resistance reduces losses 
while decreasing the damping effects. An optimum design is  
 
hard to achieve. European patent publication EP-A-443 342 
teaches a method of controlling energy transfer in a 
static converter. The converter uses DC primary and 
secondary windings linked by a magnetic circuit, the 
permeability of which is controlled by flux induced 
in the magnetic circuit by a snubber circuit. Various clamping and snubbing circuits have been 
proposed to limit or eliminate voltage spikes across 
rectifiers. It is known to provide a R-D-C clamp 
circuit for a full-bridge rectifier as shown in 
Figures 1 and 1A in the present
