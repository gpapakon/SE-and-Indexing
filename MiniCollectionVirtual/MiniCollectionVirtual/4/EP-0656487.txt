<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic anti-vibration bushing comprising two rigid tubular reinforcing members (1, 2) surrounding one another and joined together by an elastomeric body (3) forming, with these reinforcing members, at least two leaktight pockets (A, B) filled with fluid which are diametrically opposed and communicate with one another via a narrow passage (C), the bushing including a belt (strip) (4) attached around the elastomeric body, which is formed of a substantially rigid material and which has two rigid parts (41, 42), the narrow passage being entirely delimited by the belt. According to the invention, the two rigid parts of the belt are fixed to one another by clipping when the belt is fitted around the elastomeric body.

A hydraulic anti-vibration sleeve comprising a 
rigid tubular inner frame (1) and outer frame (2), the 

frames surrounding one another and being connected by 
an elastomer body (3) shaped so as to co-operate with 

the frames to form at least two sealing-tight pockets 
(A, B), diametrically opposite one another in an 

"oscillation" direction (X) and communicating with one 
another via a narrow duct (C), the assembly made up of 

the pockets and duct being filled with a shockabsorbing 
liquid, the sleeve also comprising a belt (4) 

fitted around the elastomer body (3), the belt (4) 
being made from a substantially rigid material and 

comprising at least first and second rigid parts (4
1
, 
4
2
) disposed facing the two pockets (A, B) 
respectively, the outer tubular frame (2) being clamped 

around the elastomer body (3) and the belt (4), and the 
narrow duct (C) being entirely bounded by the belt (4) 

so that the duct (C) is radially separated from the 
tubular outer frame (2) by a wall of the belt (4),
 
characterised in that the two rigid parts (4
1
, 4
2
) of 
the belt (4) are secured to one anoth
er by snap-fitting 
when the belt (4) is positioned around the elastomer 

body (3). 
An anti-vibration sleeve according to claim 1,
 
wherein the belt (4) has an outer diameter slightly 

less than the outer diameter of the elastomer body (3) 
when the belt is secured around the elastomer body and 

before the outer frame (2) is clamped.  
 
An anti-vibration sleeve according to claim 1 or 
2, wherein the narrow duct (C) is radially bounded 

towards the interior by one (4
1
) of the two rigid parts 
of the belt and radially bounded towards the exterior 

by the other rigid part (4
2
). 
An anti-vibration sleeve according to claim 3, 
wherein the narrow duct (C) comprises a groove in the 

circumferential direction (6) communicating at its ends 
with two axial grooves (7) which open respectively into 

the two sealing-tight pockets (A, B), the 
circumferential and axial grooves being formed in a 

portion (8) of one (4
1
) of the rigid parts, which is 
pressed in sealing-tight manner against the other rigid 

part (4
2
). 
An anti-vibration sleeve according to any of the 
preceding claims, wherein snap-fitting is effected by a 

resilient hook (19) near a circumferential end of one 
of the rigid parts (4
2
) of the belt, co-operating with 
a recess (15) near a corresponding circumferential end 

of the other rigid part (4
1
) of the belt. 
An anti-vibration sleeve according to any of the 
preceding claims, wherein the belt has a hinge zone 

(4
3
) on to which the two rigid parts (4
1
, 4
2
) of the 
belt are articulated. 
An anti-vibration sleeve according to any of the 
preceding claims, wherein the elastomer body (3) has a 

substantially diametral partition (9) which separates 
the two sealing-tight pockets (A, B) and has two U-shaped 

channels (10
1
, 10
2
) in the circumferential  
 

direction, substantially diametrically opposite and 
open towards the exterior, the two rigid parts (4
1
, 4
2
) 
being interconnected by tongues (4
3
, 11, 12) which fit 
in sealing-tight manner into the U-shaped channels and 

are clamped in sealing-tight manner inside the outer 
frame (2), the narrow duct (C) being formed inside one 

of the tongues. 
An anti-vibration sleeve according to any of the 
preceding claims, wherein the belt (4) has raised 

portions (5) which project towards the interior of the 
sealing-tight pockets (A, B) in order to limit the 

amplitude of relative motion of the tubular frames (1, 
2) in the direction of oscillation (X). 
An anti-vibration sleeve according to any of the 
preceding claims, wherein the belt (4) has at least 

four openings (17) comprising at least two 
substantially diametrically opposite openings (17) 

facing each respective pocket (A, B), the four openings 
respectively connecting the two pockets (A, B) to the 

exterior before the outer tubular frame (2) is fitted. 
An anti-vibration sleeve according to claim 4,
