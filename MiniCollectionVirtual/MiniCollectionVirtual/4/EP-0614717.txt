(10) and, for a blank key (28) to be duplicated, a clamp (30) 
mounted on a carriage (26) movable in a plane in two 

directions perpendicular to a cutter (4) acting on said blank 
key (28) in order to cut it, characterised in that on said 

carriage (26) there are mounted: 

for the blank key (26), the clamp (30) provided with self-centering 
grippers (32) for gripping the blank key shank 

and also provided with a head retention member (45), said 
clamp (30) being rotatable in both directions about the 

axis of said shank and being positionable along said 
carriage (26) parallel to said axis, and

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a duplicating machine for 
bitted keys and double-bitted keys. Bitted keys are keys comprising a head, a generally 
cylindrical shank and a bit extending radially from a portion 
of the shank distant from the head and carrying a cut pattern 
consisting of a plurality of teeth distributed along the free 
longitudinal edge of the bit perpendicular to the shank axis. 
The cross-section of the shank can also be other than 
circular, ie it can be square, flat etc. Double-bitted keys (to which reference is expressly made 
in the following description) are keys comprising two bits 
extending radially from opposite sides of the shank. Bitted and double-bitted keys are generally duplicated 
by machines comprising two clamps arranged to retain the 
original cut key and the blank key to be duplicated, both 
arranged with their shank axes parallel. The two clamps are 
mounted on a carriage movable relative to the machine base, 
on which there are mounted a feeler in a position facing the 
clamp of the original key, and a cutter in a position facing 
the blank key. The opposite arrangement can also be provided, 
with the feeler and cutter mounted on a carriage and the two 
clamps mounted on the machine base. In all cases the original key is duplicated by sliding  
 
the feeler along the toothed profile of the original key, to 
cause the cutter to undergo corresponding movements relative 
to the blank key and form therein notches (and hence teeth) 
corresponding to those sensed by the feeler on the original 
key. As the cutter thickness is always less than the width of 
the notches to be formed, the cutting process consists in 
pratice of a succession of operating steps comprising 
initially moving the cutter against the bit of the blank key 
to remove a part of material corresponding to the cutter 
thickness, then withdrawing it and finally axially shifting 
the cutter through a distance less than its thickness, to 
enable it to repeat the operation on a bit part adjacent to 
the preceding. The amount of penetration of the cutter into the blank 
key is limited by the counteraction of the feeler resting on 
the original key. There currently exist manual duplicating machines in 
which the cutter and feeler are moved manually relative to 
the clamps, and automatic duplicating machines in which these 
movements are motorized. More specifically, in the case of automatic machines, to 
which category the machine of the present invention pertains,  
 
the approach and withdrawal of the cutter to
