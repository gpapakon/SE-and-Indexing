<ABSTRACT>
Method for the real-time storage and reproduction of analog and digital external signals by means of parallelising standard computer memory peripherals (6). The external signals are passed via a scalable data bus (4) to the parallelised memory units (6) for storage. For the recording of the external signals in the memory units (6), exclusively linear (sequential, physical) addressing is used. During the reproduction, the signals can be output in their original form or in a different format, and at any desired speed. The device can be externally controlled, either via a local console (9) or via a standard computer interface (e.g. RS232C or IEEE) (10), and additionally offers the possibility of transmitting the recorded signals, by means of an SCSI [Small Computer System Interface] host adapter (3), not in real time, to any desired host computer, for the purpose of further processing.
