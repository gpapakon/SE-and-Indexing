<ABSTRACT>
A security sealing device consisting of a support (1) onto one side of which is bonded an electronic security circuit (2) which mainly consists of a fine wire winding (23) connected to an electronic component (20). The electronic component may be coded so that, when it is activated and read by an external controller via the winding acting as an antenna, it sends out a code. The device may further comprise various adhesive elements (10, 11, 12) so that once the support comprising the security circuit has been applied in order to seal a container, any attempt to peel or tear it off will break the electronic circuit and prevent it from sending out its code when read.

A safety sealing device intended to be applied to an 
object to be sealed or marked, comprising a support (1) on which 

is disposed an electronic safety circuit (2) by which the integrity 
of the sealing can be checked by electronic means 

electromagnetically, the unsealing of said device causing a 
break in continuity by mechanical effect of at least one portion 

of said electronic safety circuit characterized in that the 
support (1) is flexible. 
Safety sealing device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said electronic safety circuit is passive and does 

not include any power source. 
Sealing device according one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that said electronic safety circuit is made up of a 

programmable electronic component (20) connected by at least one 
connection wire (22) to a winding of fine wire (23). 
Sealing device according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the electronic component is capable of receiving a fixed 

code programmed at the factory. 
Sealing deviced according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the electronic component is capable of receiving a code 

programmable by the user. 
Sealing device according to one of the claims 4 or 5, 
characterized in that after programming of the code, said code 

is locked. 
Sealing device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said safety circuit is able to be activated 

and interrogated by outside electronic means, the winding 
then acting as an antenna, a break in continuity of said circuit 

preventing transmission of the code. 
Sealing device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises gluing means (10, 11, 12) 

such that at least one of the elements of the electronic safety 
circuit composed of the winding, the connection wires, and the 

electronic component adheres strongly to at least two intermovable  
 

parts (11, 12; 32, 33) of the support (1), or of the object 
to which it is applied for sealing or marking. 
Sealing device according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the support possesses differentiated adhesive means (10, 

11, 12) such that the adhesion of one or of two of the elements 
constituted by the winding, the connection wires, and the electronic 

components, to the support parts to which they are originally 
glued, is less than the adhesion of this element or of 

these two elements to the parts of support (1) or of the object 
parts to which they are applied for sealing. 
Sealing device according to one of the claims 8 or 9, 
characterized in that the support is disposed in a manner to 

encircle two parts (30, 31) of a recipient (3), the two said 
recipient parts being intermovable, one part of the support (11) 

being glued to another part of the support (12), a break in 
continuity of the safety circuit being caused by a displacement 

of one of said parts of the recipient relative to the other 
and/or a tearing or ungluing of one of the parts of the support. 
Sealing device according to one of the claims 8 or 9, 
characterized in that the support (1) is disposed in a manner to 

encircle a closed-loop-shaped part of an object, one part of the 
support (11) being glued to another part of the support (12), a 

break in continuity of the safety circuit being caused by a 
te
aring or ungluing of one of the parts of the support. 
Sealing device according to one of the claims 8 or 9, 
characterized in that one part of the support (11) is provided 

to be glued to a first part (32) of a recipient, another part of 
the support (12) being provided to be glued to a second part 

(33) of the recipient, the two said recipient parts being intermovable, 
a break in continuity of the safety circuit being 

caused by a displacement of one of said parts of the recipient 
relative to the other and/or a tearing or ungluing of one of the 

parts of the support. 
Sealing device according to one of the claims 8 or 9, 
characterized in that the support is provided to be glued to an 

object, a break in continuity of the safety circuit being caused 
by a tearing or ungluing of one of the parts of the support.  

 
Sealing device according to one of the claims 8 to 13, 
characterized in that the safety circuit is arranged in such a 

way that a cut of one portion of the fine connection wire and/or 
wire constituting one or more turns of the winding causes the 

break in continuity of the said safety circuit. 
Sealing device according to claim 14, characterized in 
that at least one portion of the fine connection wire and/or 

wire constituting one or more turns of the winding comprises at 
least one beginning of a break. 
Use of the sealing device according to one of the preceding 
claims for the sealing of a recipient. 
Use of the sealing device according to one of the preceding 
claims for the marking of an object.
