<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention pertains to novel azodicarboxylic acid derivatives and to 
polymer compositions stabilized therewith. U.S. Patent No. 4,255,536 teaches that selected azodicarboxylates are useful to 
modify copolymers containing residual unsaturation. S. S. Ivanov et al. disclose in Rubber Chem. and Tech., 30, 895 (1957) the reaction 
of azodicarboxylates with rubber to form branched and crosslinked derivatives. D. S. Campbell et al., Polymer 19, 1107 (1978) and Polymer 20, 393 (1979) 
disclose the efficient grafting of polystyrene containing reactive azodicarboxylate units 
onto polydienes both in solution and in the absence of a solvent. D. N. Schulz et al., Macromolecules 13, 1367 (1980) describe the azodicarboxylate 
modification of polybutadienes with respect to structure reactivity and structure property 
relationships. On the other hand, the potential use of a light stabilizer containing an 
azodicarboxylic acid derivative to modify unsaturated elastomers and thereby 
incorporating the light stabilizer into the vulnerable unsaturated backbone of polymers 
such as ABS, impact polystyrene (IPS), high impact polystyrene (HIPS), SBS, SIS, 
polybutadiene (PB), polyisoprene (PI), emulsion SBR, EPDM, AES and ASA is not 
implied in any of the above references. The resulting polymers containing the light 
stabilizer exhibit greatly improved light stability. Rubber modified polymers such as ABS and HIPS and several thermoplastics such 
as polypropylene (PP)/EPDM, PP/NBR, PP/NR and the like are susceptible to light  
 
induced oxidative degradation attributed mainly to the unsaturated diene phase. The 
instant invention locates the light stabilizer in the vulnerable diene phase through a 
covalent bond via the thermalene reaction of these polymers with compounds of the 
instant invention. The additive grafts to the polymer backbone during a reactive 
processing step. In addition to improved light stability, binding of the additive during 
processing imparts a high degree of permanence. The physical loss of stabilizer additive 
and migration of said additive is thus minimized during demanding end-use application. 
Also, non-migrating polymer-bound stabilizer additive can find use in medical and other 
applications requiring FDA regulation (such as in materials coming into contract with 
food). Thus, decreased volatility and diffusion and extraction resistance are desirable 
properties resulting from additives which are grafted onto a substrate. In alloys and blends such as ABS/polycarbonate (PC), the
