<CLAIMS>
Process for the preparation of methylchlorosilanes 
from silicon and methyl chloride in the presence 

of a copper catalyst and if appropriate promoter substances, 
in which the production rates of the individual 

methylchlorosilanes, based on the surface area of the 
silicon employed, are controlled by the structure of the 

silicon, characterized in that silicon having the 
structural parameter QF of 18 to 60 is employed, the 

structural parameter QF being determined by 

a) cutting up silicon test specimens to form a cut 
surface, 
b) totalling on the cut surface the areas of the 
precipitates of intermetallic phases having a 

longitudinal shape with a degree of roundness of 
>
 2 to 
give an area number A, 
c) totalling on the cut surface the areas of the 
precipitates of intermetallic phases having a circular 

shape with a degree of roundness of â‰¦ 2 to give an area 
number B, and 
d) obtaining the quotient of the area number A and the 
area number B, called the structural parameter QF. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which water-granulated 
silicon is employed.
