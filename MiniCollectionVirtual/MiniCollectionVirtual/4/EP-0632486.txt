<ABSTRACT>
An epitaxial semiconductor material particularly 
suitable for a high switching rectifier has misfit 

dislocations (28, 30, 32) formed in the depletion region 
(16) adjacent a PN junction (20). A method is described 

for forming each Si/Ge misfit dislocation region (Fig. 2) 
epitaxially on a capped Si substrate (10). These misfit 

dislocation layers are formed in a step in a CVD reactor 
chamber at a lowered temperature. To enhance switching 

speed gold, and preferably gold and platinum, is diffused 
through the Si body and forms relatively large 

concentrations at the misfit dislocation sites. In a 
modification (Fig. 3) the misfit dislocations are provided 

just outside the depletion region (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
fabricating a structure of semiconductor material by
epitaxial growth on a silicon substrate in a CVD reactor
chamber. The invention also relates to a method of forming
a bipolar semiconductor device including a power rectifier junction.The invention is concerned with the fabrication of
epitaxial material in which misfit dislocations are formed.
The use of misfit dislocations permits improved control of
the switching speed or other lifetime dependent parameters
of bipolar semiconductor devices manufactured from such
semiconductor material.It is known that the switching speed of silicon
bipolar devices can be increased by the introduction of
heavy metallic impurities in the active region of the
device. The impurities significantly reduce minority-carrier
lifetime and as a result shortens reverse recovery
time. Gold and platinum impurities are often used, and are
rapidly diffused into this silicon. However, the solid
solubilities of these impurities in silicon are very small
and they tend to precipitate or segregate at defects,
disordered regions, and surfaces. Their diffusion is
therefore difficult to control and is sensitive to process
conditions, particularly the diffusion temperature and
time, and also cooling rate (after the diffusion) in
certain temperature ranges.U.S. Patent No. 5,097,308 issued March 7, 1992 and
U.S. Patent No. 5,102,810 issued April 7, 1992, both to Ali
Salih, are directed to a method for controlling the 
switching speed of bipolar power devices through the use of
misfit dislocations in the depletion region. The misfit
dislocations are formed during epitaxial growth by creating
a silicon/silicon-germanium interface.The above-mentioned U.S. patent 5,102,810 discloses a
method for fabricating a structure of semiconductor
material by epitaxial growth on a silicon substrate in a
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor chamber, in which
a region having misfit dislocations is formed by
successively growing layers of germanium-containing silicon
and germanium-free silicon on an initial epitaxially grown
silicon layer. It is to be recognized that this initial
layer will be grown at an appropriate given temperature.In US patent 5,102,810 there is disclosed a semiconductor
structure having a region of misfit dislocations, within
which there are two or more spaced germanium-containing
silicon layers, these layers being separated by a
germanium-free silicon layer.Both the mentioned U.S. patents propose the use of
misfit dislocations to lower the
