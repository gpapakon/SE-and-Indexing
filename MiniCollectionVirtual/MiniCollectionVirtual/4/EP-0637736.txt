<ABSTRACT>
A sensor for detecting the combustion pressure of an 
engine, in which an upper fixing member and a casing are 

fixed while a pre-load is being applied to the upper fixing 
member, so that a pre-load may be applied to a piezoelectric 

element. Moreover, a tubular diaphragm for transforming a 
pressure into a stain and a pressure receiving face for 

receiving the combustion pressure are connected to each 
other through a plunger so that they may be kept away from 

each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piezoelectric 
pressure sensor suited for detecting a pressure such as a 
combustion pressure in a cylinder of an internal combustion 
engine. The piezoelectric pressure sensor making use of a 
piezoelectric effect for establishing an electricity by 
applying a stress is widely used in the prior art. 
Especially, there has been developed a pressure sensor which 
is suited for detecting the combustion pressure in a 
cylinder of an internal combustion engine by using a tubular 
diaphragm. Fig. 1 shows a basic construction of a 
piezoelectric pressure sensor which is used in the internal 
combustion engine of the prior art while using the tubular 
diaphragm. Fig. 1 presents a longitudinal section of the 
sensor which is equipped with a casing having a dual 
structure. In an inner casing 28, there are disposed a 
pressure transmission member 29 and a piezoelectric element 
27 which are fixed on a base 31 by the fixing force of an  
 
upper fixing screw 23. The compression applied to the 
piezoelectric element 27 by the upper fixing screw is called 
the "pre-load". This pre-load is essential not only for 
fixing the piezoelectric element 27 and the pressure 
transmission member 29 but also for stabilizing the 
establishment of electricity of the piezoelectric element 27 
and for metering the vacuum at a suction stroke of the 
engine. In case, however, the pre-load is applied by the 
screw, it is difficult to become constant among a plurality 
of sensors due to dispersions in the surface roughness of 
screw faces, in the back-lashes of screw portions and in the 
frictions of screw faces, so that the sensitivities of the 
individual sensors disperse. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
piezoelectric pressure sensor having little dispersion among 
the sensors. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
piezoelectric pressure sensor which has not only little 
dispersion among the sensors but also such a slender leading 
end that it can be easily mounted on an engine having a 
small displacement. Still another object of the present invention is to  
 
provide a method of manufacturing a piezoelectric pressure 
sensor having little dispersion among the sensors. A further object of the present invention is to provide 
a small-sized piezoelectric pressure sensor which is hardly 
erroneous in the pressure detection due to the thermal 
influence from the combustion chamber. A further object of the present invention is to provide 
a method of
