<ABSTRACT>
A major histocompatibility complex class II antigen is useful as a vaccine against an immunodeficiency virus. The antigen may be a human class II antigen such as HLA-DP, HLA-DQ or HLA-DR. The virus may be a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) such as HIV-1 or HIV-2.

<DESCRIPTION>
A MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX CLASS II ANTIGEN IN A VACCINE AGAINST AN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUSThis invention relates to vaccines against immunodeficiency viruses.There has been pessimism about the prospects for a successful vaccine against AIDS. The obstacles have often appeared to be insuperable. An effective vaccine must prevent infection by a virus which destroys CD4* cells, which can integrate into the host DNA and which exhibits rapid antigenic variation. Furthermore, protection must be effective at mucosal surfaces, the primary site of entry, and against both cell-free and cell-associated virus. The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-macaque model, developed in the USA1,2, was adopted by the United Kingdom MRC AIDS Directed Programme with the primary objective of establishing that vaccination was feasible and that these obstacles to success could be overcome.We have now demonstrated that a major histocompatibiiity complex (MHC) class II antigen can protect animals in the SIV-macaque model. Accordingly, the invention provides a class II antigen for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy, in particular for use as a vaccine against an immunodeficiency virus.The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and, as active ingredient, a MHC class II antigen. The invention further provides use of a MHC class II antigen in the manufacture of a medicament for use as a vaccine against an immunodeficiency virus.The antigen is preferably a human class II antigen. The antigen may therefore be a HLA-DP, HLA-DQ or HLA-DR antigen such as the HLA-DR4 antigen. These are known antigens and can be obtained in purified form. They may be prepared as recombinant proteins.Alternatively, the class II antigen may be given presented by transfected cells, i.e. by cells transfected with a gene encoding the antigen and which consequently express the antigen. Transfected cells which may be administered to a human may be transfected cells of a human diploid cell line. Such cell lines have been tested for safety for the purpose of 

human vaccine manufacture. An appropriate cell line is the MRC5 cell line.Allogeneic lymphocytes which present a class II antigen may be administered to a patient. The lymphocytes may be given as live cells, for example as a blood transfusion. Alternatively they may also be given as fixed or inactivated cells. The lymphocytes may be ones in which the expression of the class II antigen has been
