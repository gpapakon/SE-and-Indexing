<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a collimator for 
use in cathode sputtering. More particularly, this 
invention relates to an extended lifetime collimator 
which enhances throughput capability in the sputter 
coating of wafers. In cathode sputtering, particles are sputtered 
from a target and deposited onto a wafer mounted 
opposite the target. While the aggregate travel path 
of all the sputtered particles is generally direct, 
i.e., perpendicular from a planar target to a planar 
surface of an oppositely mounted wafer, a substantial 
number of particles travel on flight paths which are 
non-perpendicular. These sputtered particles traversing 
angled flight paths may adversely affect wafer 
coverage. For example, instead of contacting and 
completely covering the bottom surfaces of vias or 
other features of a wafer, as would occur with  
 
sputtered particles taking perpendicular flight paths, 
sputtered particles traversing non-perpendicular 
angles are much more likely to deposit and accumulate 
on the side walls of features. The accumulation of 
sputtered material on the side walls of a feature 
prematurely closes off access to the bottom surface of 
the feature, before the bottom surface is entirely 
coated. As a result, unfilled voids are produced in 
the feature. This undesired closing off of access to 
the bottom surface of a feature is referred to as 
"necking" or overhang. As shown in U.S. 4,724,060, it is known to 
position a collimator between a target and a wafer to 
intercept sputtered particles which traverse undesired 
angled flight paths toward the wafer. By intercepting 
particles which vary from a perpendicular flight path 
by more than a predetermined angle, more effective 
filling of the features of a wafer is assured. In 
short, a collimator provides control over the directionality 
of the flight paths traversed by sputtered 
particles which ultimately deposit on a wafer. A typical collimator is grid-like in structure, 
with a plurality of substantially parallel 
passages. In cross section, the passages may be 
rectangular, circular, hexagonal, octagonal or any one 
of a number of other shapes. The parallel passages 
permit sputtered particles to travel therethrough in a  
 
direct, perpendicular flight path from the target to 
the wafer. Sputtered particles which traverse flight 
paths oriented at angles which vary only slightly from 
perpendicular will also pass through the passages. 
Sputtered particles which traverse flight paths 
oriented at angles which vary substantially from
