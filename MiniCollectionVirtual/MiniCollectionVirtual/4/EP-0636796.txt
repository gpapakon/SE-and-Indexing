<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic amplifier, particularly for directional valves, having a movable jet-deflecting device (6, 8) which changes the direction of a central jet directed towards two receiver ports (5). According to the invention, a return nozzle (10) with a return port (9) is arranged in such a way that it forms a variable choke point for the returning hydraulic fluid as a function of the position of the jet-deflecting device (6, 8).

A hydraulic amplifier (3), in particular for control 
valves, comprising a movable jet deflection means (6, 8) 

which varies the direction of a control jet directed to at 
least two receiver openings (5), and comprising at least 

one return opening (9), 
characterized in
 that said return 
opening is arranged such that it forms a variable throttle 

point for the backflowing hydraulic fluid in response to 
the position of said jet deflection means (6, 8). 
A hydraulic amplifier according to claim 1, 

characterized in
 that said return opening (9) is arranged 
laterally next to said jet deflection means (6, 8) in such 

a way that said means forms said variable throttle point 
together with said opening. 
A hydraulic amplifier according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in
 that said return opening (9) is arranged 
in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane in 

which said jet deflection means (6, 8) is moved. 
A hydraulic amplifier according to at least one of 
claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
 that said jet deflection 
means (6, 8) is cylindrical in the areas opposite to a 

return opening (9) or has even surfaces. 
A hydraulic amplifier according to at least one of 
claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
 that two return openings 
(9) are arranged opposite each other and said jet 

deflection means (6, 8) is movable between said openings.  
 
A hydraulic amplifier according to at least one of 
claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
 that said jet deflection 
means is constructed as a pivotable jet tube (6) having a 

nozzle (8) supported therein. 
A hydraulic amplifier according to at least one of 
claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
 that said jet deflection 
means is constructed as a stationary nozzle with a 

downstream movable deflection element.
