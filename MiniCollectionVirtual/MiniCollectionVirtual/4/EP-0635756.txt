<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal 
developing photosensitive member capable of forming an 
image by a dry process and an image forming method using 
the thermal developing photosensitive member. A silver-salt photographing method using a silver 
halide is a recording technology exhibiting excellent 
sensitivity and gradient expression characteristics and 
therefore used widely. However, the method involving to 
perform the process after exposing the image to light in 
a wet manner has suffered from unsatisfactory working 
property, covenience and safety. On the other hand, study of dry material, with which 
the wet process can be omitted, has been made and 
resulted in disclosures in Japanese Patent Publication  
 
No. 43-4921 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 43-4924. 
The foregoing disclosure each uses a photosensitive 
silver halide in a quantity as a catalyst and a non-photosensitive 
organic silver salt is used as an image 
forming material. The reason why the organic silver salt 
serves as the image forming material is considered due to 
the following mechanism. 
(1) Exposure to image causes a latent image to be formed 
on the photosensitive silver halide in a quantity as a 
catalyst; and (2) The latent image serves as a catalyst and the 
photosensitive member is therefore heated, causing the 
organic silver salt and a reducing agent to take part in 
redox reactions to reduce the organic silver salt into 
silver which forms the image. The heat developing photosensitive member has an 
advantage that it forms an image by a dry process in 
place of the wet process. Therefore, it has been used as 
an industrial photosensitive member in a variety of 
fields, for example, image communication, medical care 
and computer output fields. The heat developing 
photosensitive member exhibits excellent photosensitivity 
because the silver halide is contained as the 
photosensitive element. Furthermore, sensitization to a 
visible region can easily be performed.  Recently, semiconductor laser has been developed and 
practiced which exhibits low cost, small size, light 
weight and excellent output efficiency as compared with 
gas laser. Therefore, uses of the low-cost, small and 
light laser beam source and the heat developing 
photosensitive member will enable a low-cost, compact and 
high performance dry image recording system to be 
realized. A conventional gelatin-type silver halide 
photosensitive member for a wet process has employed a 
cyanine dye for the purpose of improving the 
photosensitivit
