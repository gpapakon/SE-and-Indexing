<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for administering a test to detect the esophagitis in a patient utilizes a sealed pliable tube (11). When the tube is unsealed and inserted in the esophagus of a patient, an acidic solution stored in the tube (11) flows into the esophagus (30) and, if the patient has esophagitis, causes the chest pain or other symptoms which the patient experiences during esophagitis.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHDD AND APPARATUS FOR TESTING FOR ESOPHAGITISThis invention relates to a method and apparatus for diagnosing esophagitis in a patient.More particularly, the invention relates to portable apparatus of inexpensive manufacture which can quickly and easily be utilized in a hospital emergency room, in a physician's office, or at the residence of a patient to determine whether chest pains experienced by the patient are, instead of being caused by a heart condition, caused by esophagitis.In another respect, the invention relates to esophagitis test apparatus which administers a test fluid to a patient under atmospheric pressure and the force of gravity and utilizes displacement pressures generated by peristaltic motion to assist in the distribution of the fluid in the esophagus of a patient.As noted at page 54 in the February 1983 issue of the journal Hospital Practice:"Next to abdominal pain, chest pain poses the most challenging differential diagnosis to the medical acumen of clinicians, who—rather than examine the patient at home, or even in the office, and face dependence on their clinical skills alone—now are prone to refer patients directly to the hospital emergency room. Once there, it is all too difficult to avoid the increasingly expensive technological "rule-out routine" in the face of medical, legal, and peer pressures for prompt decisions. A characteristic description of strangling retrosternal pain, accompanied by mortal anxiety and related to exertion, is now so habitually associated with coronary artery disease that angina due to other causes, such as pericarditis or esophagitis, are put on the far- 

 back burner even in patients in low-risk coronary disease categories. As an interested student for many years of anterior chest pain of non-coronary disease origin, I was intrigued with a report from Ipswich, England, of 100 unselected consecutive medical emergency patients with anterior chest pain who were followed to their final diagnosis to discover, specifically, the prevalence of esophageal disease as a cause of their symptom. One fifth (16) of the 77 patients whose pain was definitely considered "anginal" had abnormalities of the esophagus demonstrated by endoscopy with biopsy, manometry, radiology, and acid perfusion (Bernstein and Baker method). None of these 16 had abnormal exercise tolerance tests. In eight a proactive test reproduced the symptoms. Esophageal acid perfusion was the most useful investigation in this group. However, in the remaining eight patients, testing reveal

CLAIMS
1. Apparatus for insertion into the esophagus through the nose to test a patient to detect the condition of esophagitis in the patient, said apparatus comprising (a) a sealed elongate pliable tube having
(i) at least one wall, (ii) a lower end for insertion through the nose into the end of the esophagus adjacent the stomach, (ϋi) a reservoir circumscribed by said wall, and
(iv) an upper end to extend out of the nose after said first end is inserted into said end of the esophagus;
(b) a 0.05 to 0.5N solution of hydrochloric acid stored in said reservoir while said lower end of said tube is inserted through the nose into the esophagus;
(c) at least one sealed aperture formed in, said lower end in fluid communication with said reservoir; (d) at least one sealed aperture formed in said upper end in fluid communication with said reservoir; said one aperture in said lower end and said lower end being shaped and dimensioned such that when
(e) said one aperture in said lower end is unsealed and said lower end is inserted in said esophagus, the peristalsis of the esophagus causes the walls of said esophagus to contact said lower end and periodically generate forces which act on said solution and exert a pulling force on said solution in a direction of travel out of said one aperture in said lower end into said esophagus;
(f) said apertures in said upper and lower ends are each unsealed, said aqueous solution flows from said reservoir out through said first aperture under the force of gravity, under atmospheric pressure, and under peristaltic action; and,
(g) said one aperture in said lower end is unsealed and said one aperture in said upper end is not 


 unsealed, said aqueous solution remains in said reservoir due to surface tension and does not flow from said reservoir out through said one aperture in said lower end. A method of administering a test to a patient to detect the condition of esophagitis in the patient, including the steps of
(a) inserting a tube through the nose into the esophagus of a patient, said tube having (i) at least one pliable wall,
(ii) upper and lower ends, (iii) a reservoir circumscribed by said wall, (iv) at least a first aperture formed in said lower end and in fluid communication with said reservoir,
(v) at least a second aperture formed in said upper end and in fluid communication with said reservoir, and
(vi) an acidic aqueous solution stored in said reservoir while said lower end of said tube is inserted through the nose into the esophagus, said tube being shaped and dimensioned such that (vii) said lower end can be inserted through the nose of a patient and into the lower portion of the esophagus adjacent the stomach, (viii) the peristaltic action of the esophagus generates forces which act to draw fluid through said first aperture, and (iv) after said first end is inserted through the nose into the lower portion of the esophagus adjacent the stomach, said upper end extends outwardly from the nose and can be grasped; said first aperture and said lower end being shaped and dimensioned such that
(x) when said first and second apertures are open said solution flows from said reservoir out through said first aperture under atmospheric 


 pressure and the force of gravity, and
(xi) when said first aperture is open and said second aperture is closed, said solution remains in said tube and does not flow from said reservoir out through said first aperture, said second aperture being closed and said first aperture being open when said lower end is being inserted in said esophagus; and, (b) opening said second aperture to permit said solution to flow through said first aperture under atmospheric pressure, under peristaltic action, and under the force of gravity into the lower portion of the patient's esophagus. Apparatus for insertion into the esophagus through the nose to detect the condition of esophagitis in a patient, said apparatus comprising
(a) an elongate pliable tube having (i) at least one wall, (ii) a lower end for insertion through the nose into the end of the esophagus adjacent the stomach, (iii) a reservoir circumscribed by said wall, and (iv) an upper end to extend out of the nose after said first end is inserted into said end of the esophagus;
(b) a liquid solution stored in said reservoir while said lower end of said tube is inserted through the nose into the esophagus, said solution effective to irritate the burned lining of the esophagus when the patient has esophagitis;
(c) at least a first aperture formed in said lower end and in fluid communication with said reservoir;
(d) at least a second aperture formed in said upper end and in fluid communication with said reservoir; said first aperture and said lower end being shaped and dimensioned such that when 


 (e) said second aperture is open and said first aperture is open, said liquid solution flows from said reservoir out through said first aperture under atmospheric pressure and the force of gravity; and,

5. The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein
(a) said apparatus is inserted into the esophagus through the mouth instead of being inserted through the nose;
(b) said lower is inserted through the mouth into the end of the esophagus adjacent the stomach; and,
(c) said upper end extends out of the mouth after said first end is inserted into said end of the esophagus.
6. The method of Claim 2 wherein
(a) said tube is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus of a patient instead of being inserted through the nose; (b) said tube is shaped and dimensioned such that said lower end can be inserted through the mouth and into the lower portion of the esophagus adjacent the stomach; and, (c) after said first end is inserted through the mouth into the lower portion of the esophagus adjacent the stomach, the upper end extends outwardly from the mouth and can be grasped.
