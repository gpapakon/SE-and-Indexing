<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of two-dimensinal 
aggregation and fixation of protein. The method 

comprises steps of pouring a protein solution into a 
substrate solution having a larger surface tension and a 

larger specific gravity than those of the protein solution, 
causing the protein solution to float up to the surface of 

the substrate solution for development to produce a protein 
denatured film on the surface, and causing said film to 

adsorb protein having been poured and having floated for 
two-dimensional aggregation and fixation. 
A uniform high-quality two-dimensional aggregation and 
fixation of protein is achieved by simple equipment and 

operations. Lamination into a three-dimensional structure 
is also easy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of two-dimensional
aggregation and fixation of protein. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a method of
forming a high-quality proteinous two-dimensionally fixed
aggregate excellent in uniformity useful as a functional
thin film or a three-dimensionally integrated functional
film.It is believed that two-dimensional or three-dimensional
structurization of protein is indispensable for
next-generation substrate technologies such as molecular
element, biosensor and biologically compatible materials.
Positive efforts have therefore been made to find a method
of structurizing protein at a higher accuracy.The conventional technologies have however some
problems to be solved.The following representative methods of forming a two-dimensional
aggregate of protein are known:
(a) a method of forming a two-dimensional crystalline aggregate
by forming a lipid monolayer on the surface of a
protein solution and using linkage with protein and
fluidity; and(b) a method of developing a protein solution on the surface
of a flat liquid metal such as mercury or a solid such as mica
and forming a crystalline aggregate during the drying 
process thereof.It is also known, in these methods, that the protein
solution is developed by using a substrate solution having a
larger specific gravity and a larger surface tension than
the protein solution, and dripping the protein solution onto
the surface thereof.In these conventional methods, however, the ratio of
success has been very low because of the difficulty in
selecting a proper lipid, non-uniformity increased by
disturbance during dripping of the protein solution, and the
difficulty in forming a two-dimensional aggregate of uniform
protein particles. When using mercury, the process has
inevitably been complicated as a result of troublesome
handling, and large-sized equipment requiring a high cost.The conventional methods have another problem in that it
is difficult to three-dimensionally laminate a two-dimensional
aggregate into a multi-layer structure and this
serious obstacle in building a three-dimensional protein
structure has not as yet been solved. More specifically,
protein may be denatured during the drying process in the
conventional methods.The present invention has therefore an object to provide
a novel method for two-dimensional aggregation and fixation
of protein particles, which solves the defects in the conventional
methods as described above, permits formation of a
uniform and high-quality two-dimensional

<CLAIMS>
A method of two-dimensional aggregation and fixation
of protein, which comprises the steps of introducing a protein

solution into a substrate solution having a larger surface
tension and a larger specific gravity than those of the

protein solution, causing the protein solution to float and
develop on the surface of the substrate solution to produce

a denatured protein film on the surface, and causing said
film to adsorb further protein having been introduced into the

substrate solution and floated.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein multiple layers of
two-dimensionally aggregated and fixed protein are formed.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2
wherein the two-dimensionally

aggregated and fixed protein is heated to transcribe
same onto a solid substrate.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
protein forming said denatured protein film and the protein two-dimensionally

aggregated and fixed onto said denatured
protein film are of different kinds.
