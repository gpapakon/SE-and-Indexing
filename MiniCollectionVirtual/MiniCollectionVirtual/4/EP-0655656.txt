<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for
developing an electrostatic image, used in
electrophotography, an electrostatic recording process and an
electrostatic printing process.In electrophotography, an electrostatic recording
process and an electrostatic printing process, an
electrostatic image formed on an electrostatic image support
is visualized with toner particles composed mainly of a
resin and a colorant. This visualized image is fixed on the
electrostatic image support, or it is transferred to other
receptor and then fixed. For this reason, the toner is
required to have not only excellent developing properties
but also excellent transfer and fixing properties. In
recent years, a toner which can be fixed with low energy is
increasingly demanded in view of energy saving.A heat-fixing method is largely classified into a
non-contact heating method such as oven-fixing and a contact
heating method such as hot roller fixing. The contact
heating method is preferable in view of energy saving, since
it has advantages in that the heat efficiency is high, that
the fixing portion requires no large electric power and that
the fixing portion can be decreased in size. However, the
problem with the contact heating method is that an offset
phenomenon occurs. The offset phenomenon is that part of a
toner forming an image transfers to the hot roller surface
at a fixing time and is transferred to a subsequent support
to contaminate an image. Therefore, various proposals have
been made to overcome the above offset phenomenon. One proposal is to incorporate a compound having
releasability such as a wax into a toner, and this proposal
is widely practiced. However, when this compound is
incorporated into a toner, part of the wax adheres to a
photoconductive drum, and a so-called filming is liable to
take place. Further, the toner shows a poor shelf life.
US-A-4557991 discloses a toner comprising a binder resin
selected from, inter alia, a polyester resin, and a wax
There is another proposal to incorporate a polymer having a
high molecular weight into a resin constituting the toner.
In this case, the offset phenomenon can be prevented.
Impractically, however, this proposal involves problems in
that a high fixing temperature is required since the
softening point of the toner becomes high and that it is
difficult to pulverize toner materials since the resin is
tough.For overcoming the above problems, there is
proposed a toner containing a vinyl-containing polymer
having a broad molecular weight distribution from a low
m
