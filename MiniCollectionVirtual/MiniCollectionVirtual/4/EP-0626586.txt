<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for testing an immunity
of various electric devices against electromagnetic
interference and a method of testing the immunity thereof, and
more particularly to an apparatus and method for measuring and
evaluating an immunity or a radio wave stress of various
electric devices such as printed circuit boards, circuit
elements and any electric and electronics devices as well as
an apparatus for irradiating an electromagnetic wave or a
radio wave for the immunity testing.From WO-A-92/05601, an apparatus and method for simulating
electromagnetic environments is known. However, this system is
not able to determine whether or not within a measuring sample
there is an abnormal state.The value and importance of testing and measuring an immunity
and electromagnetic wave stresses of any electronic devices
such as digital circuits against various sources of 
electromagnetic wave interferences or radio wave interferences
have been on the increase in view of electromagnetic
environmental problems. These problems are serious problems on
account of increase of an amount of irradiation of extra
electromagnetic energies typically excess radio noises. The
concept of the electromagnetic environmental problems or
electromagnetic compatibility had been established. The
problem with radio noise interferences are serious. The radio
noise may be defined as an electromagnetic wave which is able
to be superimposed on an informational signal, thereby causing
an interference with any transmission of the informational
signals. The device which may suffer the radio noise
interference may include various electric and electronics
devices involving, for example, printed circuit boards and
cables. A radio noise which has entered into an electric or
electronics device is able to cause a radio noise interference
which places this device in an abnormal state, thereby
resulting in various malfunctions of the device. Even if the
electric or electronic device potentially possesses excellent
performances, such device having suffered the radio noise
interferences are no longer able to show such excellent
performances.From the above descriptions, the importance in establishing a
useful technique for testing and measuring the immunity of the
electric and electronic devices to the electromagnetic wave 
interference or the radio wave interferences could readily be
appreciated.One of the conventional techniques for testing the immunity of
any electric and electronics devices to the radio noise
interference is
