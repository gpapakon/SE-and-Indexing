<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the structure of an 
optical waveguide device that functions while a 
functional component for performing optical branching, 
coupling, switching, and the like is inserted in the path 
of an optical waveguide and, more particularly, to a 
structure for facilitating manufacture of such a device 
which has a small transmission loss in an insertion 
region of the functional component. An optical device that performs optical branching, 
coupling, switching, and the like in a small region on an 
millimeter-order is a very important constituent element 
for downsizing or increasing the degree of functions of 
an optical communication system, an optical sensor, or 
the like. As such an optical device, a so-called parts 
insertion type optical waveguide device which functions 
by inserting a functional component for performing 
optical functions such as optical branching, coupling, 
switching, and the like in an optical waveguide has been 
attracting attention in recent years. In this optical waveguide device, functions such as 
optical branching, coupling, and the like are  
 
conventionally realized by fabricating a directional 
coupler or an optical waveguide pattern having a 
structure of, e.g., a Y- or X-shaped waveguide, on a 
waveguide substrate. The switching function is realized 
by varying the propagation constant of the directional 
coupler. Other than the method described above, the functions 
of branching, coupling, switching and the like of the 
optical waveguide device can be realized by incorporating 
a functional component that performs branching, coupling, 
switching, and the like in the path of the optical 
waveguide formed on the waveguide substrate. Fig. 1 shows the arrangement of a conventional 
parts-insertion type optical waveguide device for 
realizing the optical branching function. In this 
conventional optical waveguide device, a half mirror 2 
serving as a functional component for separating light is 
inserted at the intersecting portion (an insertion region 
where the functional component is to be inserted) of a 
T-shaped optical waveguide 1. The half mirror 2 has an 
angle of 45° with respect to the optical path of the light 
to be incident on it. In the conventional optical 
waveguide device, the core width of the optical waveguide 
1 is constant (the refractive index difference between 
the core and the cladding layer is also constant). In 
this arrangement, light propagating through an incident  
 
side optical waveguide 1a (the incident side of
