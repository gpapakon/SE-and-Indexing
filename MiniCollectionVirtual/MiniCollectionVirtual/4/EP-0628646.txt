<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the mixing of individual fibre components on the basis of properties of a required intermediate product, for example a card sliver, or of a required end product, for example a yarn. This mixing takes place in that fibre bales (2) are combined to form component groups, and the fibre components of these groups are administered accurately by means of metering devices (11) to a mixer, in which these components are mixed homogeneously. The product of the mixer is subsequently cleaned in a cleaner (60) and is thereafter transferred for processing to a card (63). After the card, the card sliver is tested in a colour tester (65), and the corresponding signal is transmitted to a control (7;7.1;7.2;44) which primarily controls the component mixture and secondarily is corrected by such a colour signal, insofar as the primary mixture control is varied correspondingly, until the colour at the exit of the card is correct again in the card sliver. Furthermore, the card sliver is tested for fibre fineness (MICRONAIR) by means of the fibre-fineness tester (66), and a corresponding signal is transmitted to the abovementioned control. The abovementioned component mixture is likewise changed on the basis of this signal, if the fineness differs from a predetermined desired value. A third signal (81) comes from the card control (64). This signal transmits the output (kg/h) to the abovementioned control, in order to control the stripping capacity of the stripping devices (20,23).
