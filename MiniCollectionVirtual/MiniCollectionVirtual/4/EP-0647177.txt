<ABSTRACT>
A polymeric composite structure having a polymeric shell layer with a finish-side and a non-finish side and a cross-linked thermosetting polymeric backing layer and method of manufacturing thereof is provided. The cross-linked thermosetting polymeric backing layer is simultaneously molded to conform to the shape of and bonded directly to essentially the entire non-finish side of the polymeric shell layer. The method includes forming the polymeric shell having a finish-side and non-finish side into a suitable shape, placing the shell into a mold, and introducing an uncured blended mixture of unsaturated thermosetting polymeric backing material and cross-linking promoter into the mold to force the backing material to directly coat the non-finish side of the shell. Curing the molded thermosetting polymeric backing material at a suitable temperature and sufficient time allows hardening and cross-linking of the thermosetting polymeric material and bonding directly to the non-finish side of the polymeric shell to permit demolding of the composite structure without damage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyester backed acrylic 
composite molded structure. More particularly, it relates to 
a composite structure having a polyester polymeric backing 
material applied during a molding process to an acrylic shell 
for manufacturing of lightweight durable articles such as 
sanitary fixtures including bathtubs, sinks, shower receptors, 
lavatories and the like which are lightweight, and resist 
damage and delamination when subjected to impact, the weight of 
the user and thermal shock. In the development of bathroom and kitchen fixtures, 
as well as bathtubs, whirlpool tubs and other composite 
articles, the traditional porcelain-cast iron fixtures have 
gradually been replaced by lighter and more resilient composite 
structures. While porcelain-cast iron and enameled fixtures 
had the advantage of having a very solid feel and a high weight 
bearing capability, one disadvantage of those fixtures has been 
their susceptibility to impact damage and extreme weight which 
causes great difficulties in moving and installing large 
fixtures such as sinks, bathtubs and whirlpool tubs. Initial attempts by the industry to replace these 
porcelain-cast iron fixtures were unsuccessful. The early 
composite structures had a plastic, hollow feel which would 
deform, crack, chip or delaminate when subjected to impact, 
thermal shock, or the weight of the typical bather. In 
addition, these composite structures would often delaminate, 
crack, craze or chip when subjected to impact from the outside  
 
of the structure during manufacturing, transportation and 
installation of the fixture. A successful solution to these problems is disclosed 
in U.S. Patent No. 4,664,982 to Genovese et al., and in U.S. 
Patent No. 5,049,443 to Kuszaj et al., the disclosure of both 
of which are incorporated by reference herein. Both disclose 
composite enamelled steel or stainless steel fixtures which 
have the look and feel of the earlier porcelain-cast iron 
fixtures. The structures are light, have high structural 
strength, and resist delamination, chipping and denting due to 
impact or thermal shock. The composite structures are formed 
from a steel or stainless steel which may be enamelled on one 
or both of its faces. The excellent physical and mechanical 
properties are imparted to these shells as a result of the 
chemical bonding of a plastic layer to a non-finish side of 
the shell. The preferred plastic layer is an isocyanate-modified 
thermosetting unsaturated polyester or polyether foam 
which is

fixture, comprising: 


a single polymeric shell layer (71) having a 
finish-side (72) and a non-finish side (73); and
