<DESCRIPTION>
Electrically continuous thin metal layers or films,
formed on rigid dielectric substrates by vacuum metallization,
have been long used to give substrates a reflective metallic
appearance. To slow corrosion of the metal layer, the layer
was typcally top coated with a clear, colorless dielectric
polymeric coating. However, once the top coats are damaged or
experience water infiltration, these metal films frequently
experienced widespread corrosion of the metal layer.More recently, electrically discontinuous metal layers
have been developed which appear as continuous metal layers to
the naked eye, which are less susceptible to widespread
corrosion and which can be applied to flexible substrates.
These electrically discontinuous layers consist of discrete
metallic islands, which are vacuum deposited on the substrate,
wherein the islands are separated by channels. These islands
and channels are then top coated with a dielectric polymeric
coating to separately encapsulate each island and to prevent
corrosion of the metal islands. However, under weathering
conditions the top coat has experienced water infiltration
and/or a loss of adhesion (e.g., peel) from the metal islands
and substrate in the channels.To provide adequate adhesion of the top coat to the
discontinuous layer, the metal layer has been etched with a
caustic (e.g., sodium hyroxide solution) to remove metal
deposited in the channels between the islands to provide a
larger substrate surface area for bonding with the top coat.
However, caustic etching can result in the formation of
blackened areas in the metal layer.Therefore, a need exists for a means of vacuum
metallization of rigid and flexible substrates wherein the top 
coat will adhere to the metallized layer without etching, ad
the side effects of etching, and wherein the top coat is less
susceptible to water infiltration and loss of adhesion over
time and with weathering.This invention relates to a metallized article comprising
a substrate, preferably having a polyurethane basecoat
disposed thereon, with a layer of electrically discrete
metallic islands of a corrosion prone metal disposed on the
substrate. A crosslinked polyurethane top coat, containing an
aminosilane, is further disposed on and encapsulates the
discrete metallic islands.The advantage of this invention is that it improves the
bonding of polyurethane top coats to metal islands, deposited
in a layer on a substrate, without caustic etching of the
metal layer. This invention also has the advantage of
increasing the hardness and
