<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists of a composition containing a chemically 
blocked trimerization catalyst and a polyurethane prepolymer resin or 

resins with reactive isocyanate groups. In the absence of heat, the 
catalyst is not active and the solution of catalyst in the resin undergoes 

no appreciable reaction for periods ranging from hours to weeks depending 
upon the composition and concentration of the catalysts and the structure 

and concentration of the isocyanate groups. When heat is applied to the 
mixture a trimerization reaction occurs which produces a crosslinked 

polyurethane network with utility as an elastomer or as an adhesive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to one component aromatic polyisocyanurate 
resins and to a process for forming such resins by the trimerization of an 
isocyanate terminated prepolymer formed by the reaction of an aromatic 
diisocyanate and a polyol. The preparation of polyurethane and polyurethane/urea elastomers and 
adhesives traditionally requires the combination of isocyanates or 
isocyanate containing resins with crosslinking agents, e.g., polyamines or 
polyols, in precise ratios. That is because the reactivity of the combined 
isocyanates and isocyanate terminated prepolymers and the properties of the 
final polyurethane and polyurethane/urea vulcanizates are dependent upon 
the curative-resin ratio or stoichiometry. It is further recognized in the 
preparation of the polyurethane/urea elastomers that many of the presently 
used aromatic amine curatives have potential health and safety problems or 
are crystalline solids which must be melted at high temperature and used in 
a molten state. A final problem in preparing polyurethane/urea elastomers 
is that the limited working time ("pot-life") available complicates the 
production of multiple castings and large parts that require large amounts 
of polyurethane/urea. A number of approaches have been taken to overcome such problems as 
those mentioned above. These rely upon (a) the inhibition of the 
isocyanate, (b) the retardation of the curative, and (c) the blocking of 
catalysts which promote crosslinker-isocyanate reactions. Examples of the 
first approach (a), include the use of reaction products of isocyanates 
with oximes, phenols, or caprolactams. These products are stable at room 
temperature but revert to the starting components at higher temperatures. 
Examples of the second approach (b) include deactivated complexes of 
aromatic amines which form stable admixtures with isocyanate containing 
materials at room temperature. One commercially available material sold 
under the trademark, Caytur® 21, is the 2.5:1 complex of methylenedianiline 
(MDA) with sodium chloride suspended in a carrier fluid. Heat destroys the 
weak complex and the liberated amine crosslinks the isocyanate containing  
 
material. An example of the third approach is a blend of a curative and an 
isocyanate which undergo a slow crosslinking reaction in the absence of a 
catalyst. A delayed catalyst, such as a thioalkanoic-tin complex, can be 
added. The three component blend has an extended working life at room 
temperature but rapidly cures upon heating. The preparation of
