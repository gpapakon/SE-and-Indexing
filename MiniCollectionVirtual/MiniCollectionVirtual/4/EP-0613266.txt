<ABSTRACT>
Receiver for receiving a transmission signal comprising N frequency 
multiplexed data modulated carriers, having a good comprise between insensitivity to 

multipath reception and receiver complexity, and which may enable a reduction in 
transmission bandwidth and transmitter power. In such a receiver modulation signals of 

the carriers are supplied by a frequency multiplex demodulator to a symbol detection 
device via an equalizer device. The equalizer device compensates distortion in the 

modulation signals supplied thereto, such that the symbol detection device may detect 
the transmitted data with reduced error probability. When the transmission signal 

reaches the receiver with different delay times, this distortion is mainly a kind of cross-talk 
between the modulation of adjacent carriers. Therefore substantial compensation is 

achieved by combining the modulation signal of a carrier with signals representative of 
the data of the adjacent carriers. In the receiver these signals may be obtained from the 

multiplex signal path between the frequency multiplex demodulator output and the 
output of the symbol detection device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a receiver for receiving a transmission signal
comprising a plurality of (N) frequency multiplexed data modulated carriers, said
receiver comprising a frequency multiplex demodulator and a data recovery device
having an input for receiving modulation signals of said carriers from the frequency
multiplex demodulator, and an output for supplying recovered data to further signal
processing devices, and having a multiplex data recovery signal path between said input
and said output for carrying a multiplex signal having N signal components, each
component representing the data of an individual carrier, and having an equalization
device and a symbol detection device subsequently arranged in the multiplex signal
path.A receiver of this type is known, inter alia from "Multicarrier Modulation
for Data Transmission: An Idea Whose Time Has Come", "IEEE Communications
Magazine", May 1990, pp. to 14, by John A.C. Bingham.The known receiver is suitable for receiving audio and/or video
information coded and transmitted in a digitized form, hereinafter to be referred to as
"data". An example of use is "Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting" (DTTB), the
future video version of "Digital Audio Broadcasting" (DAB). However, the receiver
may alternatively be used in modems for receiving digital information transmitted
through cables such as glass fibres, coaxial and multi-core cables for telephony.In data transmission the aim is to adapt transmitter(s) and receiver(s) in
such a way that the transmission at a given data rate expressed in bits per second has a
sufficiently low error level, with a favourable exchange between the spectral bandwidth
required for transmission and the power of the transmitter. In this respect it should be
taken into account that the properties of the transmission channel may vary with time
and that these properties may be different for each receiver location.The afore-mentioned aim is notably important in DTTB and DAB
systems. For example, in DTTB, (high-definition) video data may be transmitted within 
the frequency bands of the present-day analog terrestrial television transmitters.
Preferably, the bandwidth required for transmitting the video data should comply with
the current channel spacing in these frequency bands, which limits the bandwidth to
approximately 7 to 8 MHz. The transmitter power required for the area of coverage
should be kept as small as possible so as to limit interferences with analog video signal
transmissions. It is also desirable that the
