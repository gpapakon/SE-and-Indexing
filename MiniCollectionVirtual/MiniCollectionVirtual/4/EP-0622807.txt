<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
memory device, and more specifically to a semiconductor 
memory device suitable for accessing memory cells arranged 
into a matrix pattern at high speed. The semiconductor integrated circuits have been 
micro-miniaturized more and more with increasing 
integration rate. Further, in MOS type integrated circuits, 
the thickness of the gate insulating film has been reduced 
more and more. When the gate insulating film becomes thin, an 
electric field applied to the gate insulating film 
increases, and hence there arises the possibility that the 
gate will be easily damaged. For this reason there has recently been developed 
a semiconductor integrated circuit such that a voltage 
(e.g., 5 V) supplied from the outside of the integrated 
circuit is deboosted to a lower voltage (e.g., 3 V) inside 
the integrated circuit, so that the deboosted voltage can 
be used as a power source voltage of an internal circuit of 
the integrated circuit. Further, from the standpoint of less electricity 
consumption in integrated circuits, there has been 
developed a semiconductor memory device or a CPU in which 
the supply voltage of the integrated circuit itself is sat 
at 3 V and the entire operation thereof is assured at this 
low voltage of 3 V. Under such circumstances, a demand for 
semiconductor memory devices operated at 3 V has become 
strong in recent years, and such types of products are 
increasing gradually. However, in the case of a non-volatile 
semiconductor memory device which comprises floating gate 
type MOS transistors as memory cells, it is difficult to  
 
reduce the operating voltage down to 3 V, since the 
threshold voltage of the memory cell is high. Fig. 16 is a cross-sectional view showing a MOS 
transistor of floating gate structure. As is shown in Fig. 
16, on P-type semiconductor substrate 131, drain 132 of an 
N⁺ diffusion region and source 133 of an N⁺ diffusion region 
are formed with channel region 134 interposed therebetween. 
Over channel region 134, floating gate 135 is disposed with 
first insulating film 137 interposed therebetween. 
Further, over the floating gate 135, control gate 136 is 
disposed with second insulating film 138 interposed 
therebetween. In the construction as described above, since the 
first insulating film 137 is interposed between the 
floating gate 135 and the channel region 134, and the 
second insulating film 138 is interposed between the 
floating gate 135 and the control gate 136, a potential of 
the floating
