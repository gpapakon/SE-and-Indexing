<ABSTRACT>
The intermediate connector is intended to be mounted on a printed circuit card (12) in such a way that a first face of the connector bears on the card, and to accommodate, on a second face, an electronic circuit substrate (14) by linking contact studs provided on the substrate (4) to tracks of the card (12). The connector comprising an insulating support (20) in which are formed regularly spaced passages and electrical signal contacts (22), each intended to link one stud and one track, arranged in at least some of the passages. Each contact (22) consists of a cut-out strip having a rigid branch (28) for fastening onto the support and a flexible S-shaped branch. The passage is bounded by a partition intended to accommodate the sliding support for the rigid branch and exhibiting endstop shoulders separated by a defined gap (eo), the endstop surface closest to the first face being at a predetermined height (ho) with respect to the latter. The rigid branch, turned along the passage, includes two face-to-face endstop shoulders, separated by a defined gap (eo) greater than (e). The projection (h) of the contact from the shoulder closest to the second face is less than (ho).
