<ABSTRACT>
Methods are provided whereby an N-C-N compound is regenerated from a product of a sulfur scavenging reaction, in which said N-C-N compound removes a sulfur atom from a sulfur compound, to form the original N-C-N compound. The N-C-N compound is represented by formula (I). The product includes a hetero compound having sulfur, carbon and nitrogen atoms in its backbone. In one embodiment, the product is mixed with (1) a nitrogen compound represented by formula (II) and (2) an alkaline compound selected from alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and transition metal compounds, to form a solution, slurry or dispersion. The hetero compound is reacted with the nitrogen compound in the presence of the alkaline compound, such that a sulfur atom of the hetero compound is replaced by a nitrogen atom of the nitrogen compound. If necessary, the pH of the solution may be adjusted to about 8 to about 13 to facilitate the reaction. In alternative embodiments, the product also includes an amine complex. The nitrogen atom being substituted for the sulfur atom in the hetero compound may be obtained from either the nitrogen compound or the amine complex.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for 
regenerating a sulfur scavenging compound from a product 
of a sulfur scavenging reaction and, more particularly, 
to regenerating an N-C-N compound from a product of a 
sulfur scavenging reaction that has typically been 
difficult or expensive to regenerate. Hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans are toxic, 
corrosive and malodorous compounds. Each may be found 
in a variety of liquid and gaseous media such as natural 
gas, petroleum, refinery gas streams, carbon dioxide, 
hydrogen, coal gas streams, gas streams from viscose 
rayon production, tars and asphalt, shale gas, coke oven 
gases, ammonia synthesis gas, rubber vulcanization 
streams, gases from sulfurization plants, turpentine 
production, pulp and paper mill effluent, sewage, brine 
drilling mud, land fills, phosphoric acid production gas 
streams and other industrial gas streams and effluents. 
They are also found in the tail gases and liquids of 
some hydrogen sulfide scrubbing processes such as Claus 
plants and amine scrubbing units. Such sulfur compounds 
include hydrogen sulfide, allyl thiol, propane thiol, 
benzyl thiol, crotyl thiol, ethane thiol, thiocresol and 
thiophenol.  
 Hydrogen sulfide is an undesirable contaminant 
which is highly toxic, corrosive and has an 
objectionable odor. The release of hydrogen sulfide 
into the environment is strictly controlled by the 
Environmental Protection Agency and Department of 
Environmental Resources, as well as by other regulatory 
agencies throughout the world. Hydrogen sulfide and 
mercaptans not only have an offensive odor, but have 
also been linked to the formation of acid rain. Methods for removing hydrogen sulfide and/or 
mercaptans may be generally classified as regenerative 
and non-regenerative. Regenerative processes are 
generally more desirable because waste products are 
recycled. By regenerating sulfur scavenging compounds 
and thereby recycling the waste products, the cost, both 
economically and environmentally, of replenishing spent 
chemicals in the process and disposing of the waste 
products is lessened or eliminated. However, typical 
prior art regenerative processes often require expensive 
processing equipment and high energy input. Various amines and alkanolamines, which may be 
regenerated, have been used to remove acids, such as 
hydrogen sulfide, from gas streams. U.S. Patent No. 
2,776,870 discloses that aqueous amines and 
alkanolamines are useful for removing acids from a 
gaseous mixture. Hydrogen sulfide may be
