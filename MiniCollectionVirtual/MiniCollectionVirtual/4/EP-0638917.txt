<ABSTRACT>
The arc chamber (1) is defined by insulating sidewalls, with an arc diverter (6, 7) for each of the stationary contacts (3) and each of the cooperating movable contacts (2), leading the arc to an arc extinction packet (9). The insulating sidewall separating the arc chamber from the terminal clamp (14) has at least one opening (11) directly adjacent the latter, with a bore (13) in the terminal clamp rail (12) aligned with this opening. Pref. the terminal clamp rail bore has a smaller cross-section than the opening in the sidewall of the arc chamber, the arc extinction plate (9.1..9.n) of the arc extinction stack at least partially extended in the direction of the outer wall (15) of the arc chamber, which incorporates arc blast openings.

Arcing chamber (1) for electric switching devices, especially line protection 
circuit breakers, which is formed by lateral insulating walls, consisting of a 

contact assembly with at least one fixed contact (3) and at least one movable 
contact (2) which works together with it, and arc guiding devices (6,7) assigned 

to each of these contacts and an arc splitter assembly (9.1-9.n) into which the 
arc is led by means of the arc guiding devices (6,7), 
in which
 at least one 
aperture (11) in the immediate proximity of the connecting terminal (14) has 

been provided in the insulating wall (10) that separates the arcing chamber (1) 
from the connecting terminal (14). 
Arcing chamber for electric switching devices according to claim 1, 
in which
 
the connecting bar (12) of the connecting terminal (14) has a borehole (13) 

which is aligned with the aperture (11) ) in the insulating wall (10). 
Arcing chamber for electric switching devices according to claims 1 and 2, 
in 
which
 the borehole (13) in the connecting bar (12) of the connecting terminal 
(14) has a smaller cross-section than the aperture (11) in the insulating wall 

(10). 
Arcing chamber for electric switching devices according to one of the claims 1 
to 3, 
in which
 a plurality of apertures (11') are provided in the insulating wall 

(10).  
 
Arcing chamber for electric switching devices according to claim 4, 
in which
 in 
each case a borehole (13') in the connecting bar (12) of the connecting terminal 

(14) corresponds to each of the apertures (11') in the insulating wall (10). 
Arcing chamber for electric switching devices according to one of the claims 1 
to 5, 
in which
 parts of the arc splitters (9.1-9n) have been extended completely 
or partially in the direction of the extemal wall (15) in such a way that they 

almost reach the extemal wall (15).
