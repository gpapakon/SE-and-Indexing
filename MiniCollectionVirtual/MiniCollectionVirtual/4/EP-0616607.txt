<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a process of removing 
acetone formed during the production of acetic anhydride 
or a mixture of acetic anhydride and acetic acid by 
carbonylation processes. The preparation of acetic anhydride by contacting a 
mixture comprising methyl iodide and methyl acetate 
and/or dimethyl ether with carbon monoxide in the 
presence of a rhodium catalyst has been reported 
extensively in the patent literature. See, for example, 
U.S. Patents 3,927,078, 4,046,807, 4,374,070 and 
4,559,183 and European Patents 8396 and 87,870. These 
patents disclose that the reaction rate can be increased 
if the catalyst system includes a promoter such as 
certain amines, quaternary ammonium compounds, 
phosphines and inorganic compounds such as lithium 
compounds. The crude or partially-refined product 
obtained from such acetic anhydride processes typically 
comprises a mixture of acetic anhydride and acetic acid 
as a result of the use of acetic acid as a process 
solvent and/or the co-production of acetic acid by 
including methanol and/or water in the feed to the 
carbonylation reactor. Acetone is formed in the above-described 
carbonylation process but since it accumulates in the 
acetic anhydride production system to a maximum level of 
about 5 weight percent, based on the total weight of the 
contents of the carbonylation reactor, its removal is 
not essential to the operation of the manufacturing 
system. Furthermore, the value of the relatively small 
amount of acetone formed is not sufficient to justify 
the cost of its separation and purification to a sales 
grade acetone product. Although the mechanism by which  
 
acetone achieves a maximum steady state concentration is 
not known, it generally has been assumed that it is 
consumed in the formation of process "tars". A number of acetone removal processes have been 
described in the patent literature although there has 
been no apparent economic incentive for using them. 
U.S. Patent 4,252,748 describes a complex procedure in 
which all of the methyl iodide, all of the acetone, and 
some methyl acetate is removed from a low-boiling, 
recycle stream. The stream is then fractionated to 
obtain a methyl acetate-acetone rich stream which is 
then subjected to an azeotropic distillation with 
pentane, yielding methyl acetate and an acetone-containing 
pentane stream. The acetone is extracted 
with water and the pentane is recycled. This complex 
scheme requires the processing of large volumes of 
effluent and entails a total of 5 operational
