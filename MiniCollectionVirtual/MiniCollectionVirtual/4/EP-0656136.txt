<ABSTRACT>
For complex integrated circuits a specification is first drawn up, e.g. with the use of a hardware description language, whereafter this specification is converted into a circuit on the register-transfer plane with synthesis programs. The time behaviour of the circuits to be used is shown in the specification by a predetermined number of clock cycles, a number of clock cycles to be determined by the synthesis program or an indeterminate number of clock cycles. The indeterminate number of clock cycles is established only when the individual circuit to be inserted is found by the synthesis program. Such a time specification gives the synthesis program a greater degree of freedom in the selection of, for example, circuits included in a library.

Method for designing a circuit arrangement 
comprising circuits with the aid of a computer, 


in which the circuit arrangement is specified on an 
algorithmic plane and this specification is translated by 

a synthesis program into circuits on the register-transfer 
plane, 
in which in the specification on an algorithmic 
plane in accordance with the time response of a circuit 

to be selected, it is the case that in the specification, 
in clock cycles in each instance, between the reading of 

the input signals and the writing of the output signals 
either 
a fixed time t
V
 is prescribed in the specification, 
and 
a constant time t
(i)
 which is to be established by 
the synthesis program is used,
 
or an initially indeterminate time ∞ is used which is not 

to be established until after selection of the circuit. 
Method according to Claim 1, in which in the 
validation of the specification on an algorithmic plane 

by a simulator program the time "∞" is replaced by an 
estimated value. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
time attribute "∞" is used whenever the time response of 

this circuit is a function of path.
