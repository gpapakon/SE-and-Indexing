<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing alloys suitable for storage of 
hydrogen and electrodes using these 
alloys. Since alloys capable of storing and releasing hydrogen (which are 
abbreviated as "hydrogen storage alloys" hereinafter) were discovered 
and known to be applicable to the storage of hydrogen, it has been 
attempted to extend their application to a heat pump and a cell without 
limiting their use to the means of storing hydrogen. In particular, the 
alkaline rechargeable batteries using such alloys as negative electrode 
have reached nearly practical levels, and the alloys used therein have 
undergone successive improvements. More specifically, the LaNi5 alloy which was first examined 
(Japanese Tokkai Sho 51-13934, wherein the term "Tokkai" means an 
"unexamined patent application") has an advantage in that it can store 
a large quantity of hydrogen. However, it has also disadvantages in 
that not only La metal is expensive but also the alloy tends to 
pulverize through the alternation of storage and release of hydrogen 
and to be corroded by an alkaline or acidic solution. When the above-cited alloy was used as the electrode of an 
alkaline rechargeable battery, therefore, it had high electric capacity 
in the early stage of use, but the electric capacity thereof was reduced 
to one half or less by about 50 times' repetition of a charge-discharge 
cycle. That is, such a battery cannot withstand the use of long 
duration. The drawbacks as described above were mitigated by partly  
 
replacing the lanthanum (La) with another rare earth element such as Ce, 
Pr, and Nd, and/or the nickel (Ni) with another metal such as Co, Al and 
Mn, (as disclosed in Japanese Tokkai Sho 53-4918, Japanese Tokkai 
Sho 54-64014, Japanese Tokkai Sho 60-250558, Japanese Tokkai Sho 61-91862 
and Japanese Tokkai Sho 61-233969). Those alloys, although they were somewhat inferior to the LaNi5 
alloy in quantity of hydrogen stored therein, underwent improvements in 
liability to corrosion by alkaline and acid solutions and in charge-discharge 
cycle life of an alkaline rechargeable battery. However, they were still short in charge-discharge cycle life 
from an industrial point of view, and so it was hard to say that they 
had sufficient practical utility. The hydrogen storage alloys having the crystal structure of CaCu5 
type (which are hereinafter called the AB5 type alloys) have a multiphase 
texture composed of various intermetallic compounds, metals and so 
on. This is a main reason why such
