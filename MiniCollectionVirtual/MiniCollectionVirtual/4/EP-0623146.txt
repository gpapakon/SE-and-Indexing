<ABSTRACT>
A method of interfering with the interaction and/or function of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and Alzheimer's  beta -protein and, as a result, reducing the adverse side effects associated with formation of a complex comprising the two or with activity of the complex components. In one embodiment, the subject invention relates to methods of interfering with formation of a specific complex between ACT and  beta -protein. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to methods of inhibiting the function of the components of the ACT- beta -protein complex. In particular, it relates to methods of inhibiting the function of  beta -protein, particularly enzymatic activity, such as esterase (cholinesterase) or protease activity. Both methods are useful in treating or preventing the effects of complex formation or of the enzymatic activity of the  beta -protein and, thus, provide a potential method of treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome or normal aging. Compositions and compounds useful in the method are also the subject of this invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disorder of
the central nervous system that results in a progressive
loss of memory and other intellectual functions, such as
reasoning, orientation, and judgement (R. Katzman,
Banbury Report 15: Biological Aspects of Alzheimer's
Disease, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring
Harbor, NY, (1983)). Alzheimer's disease occurs in
sporadic and familial forms, and in the United States,
affects about 600 people for every 100,000. A characteristic
aspect of the neuropathology of the disease is the
occurrence of proteinaceous deposits referred to as
"amyloid" in the cores of brain lesions called neuritic
or senile plaques, as well as in cerebral blood vessels.
The "amyloid" deposits are generally defined as 6-10 nm
protein filaments with certain staining properties
(Abraham, C.R. et al., Cell, 52:487-501 (1988)).Amyloid deposits are also found in the brains of
aged humans, although not as extensively as in Alzheimer's
disease. Further, Down's syndrome patients more
than 30 or 40 years old invariably develop the symptoms
and neuropathology characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.One component of the amyloid deposits was identified
as A4 amyloid or β-protein (β-protein) and is 42 amino
acids long (Glenner, G.G and C.G. Wong, Biochem. Biophys.
Res. Commun.120:885-890 (1984)). This protein is
apparently derived from a larger membrane-spanning
precursor protein whose RNA is alternately spliced to 
yield several protein products (Selkoe, D.J., Science,
248: 1058-1060). These observations suggested that the
amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease could result from
abnormal expression or posttranslational modification or
processing of a normal molecule. Also intriguing was the
finding that the gene encoding the amyloid protein
precursor is located on chromosome 21, suggesting a
common cause for the the deposits observed in Down
syndrome, caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, and
Alzheimer's disease.As mentioned above, some cases of Alzheimer's
disease appear to be familial, and are inherited in an
autosomal dominant fashion. Linkage analysis in four
families pointed to a lesion on the long arm of chromosome
21 (St. George-Hyslop, P.H. et al., Science,
238:664-660 (1987)), which correlated well with the
mapping data and similarities between Down syndrome and
Alzheimer disease. Recently, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage
with amyloidosis of Dutch origin was reported to be
linked to the APP gene, and a point mutation in the
coding region of the gene was identified (Van Broeckhoven,
C. et

Use of claim 1 wherein the compound is ebelactone A.
Use of claim 1 wherein the compound is para-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl

A method for identifying a compound which is a β-protein inhibitor,
comprising the steps of:


(a) combining β-protein, a substrate upon which β-protein acts
(e.g. selected from acetylthiocholine, butyrylthiocholine and

para-nitrophenyl acetate) and a compound which is a potential
β-protein inhibitor, under conditions suitable for β-protein to act

upon the substrate, and
(b) determining whether β-protein acts upon the substrate,

wherein failure of β-protein to act upon the substrate is indicative of

a β-protein inhibitor.
The method of Claim 4, wherein in (b) the extent to which β-protein
acts upon the substrate is determined and compared with the extent

to which β-protein acts upon the substrate in the absence of the

extent in the presence of the compound than in its absence, the
compound is a β-protein inhibitor.

β-protein acts upon the substrate to a lesser extent in the presence of

the compound than it its absence, the compound is a β-protein

compound to interfere with complex formation.

formation occurs is determined and compared with the extent to

which complex formation occurs in the absence of the compound and
wherein complex formation to a lesser extent in the presence of the

compound than in the absence of the compound is an indicator that
the compound interferes with complex formation.
