<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a collar (9) adapted for 
use in combination with activatable prefilled cartridge-need 

units and disposable holders. The collar (9) is 
adapted to fit over the hub (26) of the cartridge-needle 

unit and comprises a solid circumferential neck (11); 
a circumferential foot (13) interrupted in at least one 

point having inside (15) and outside (17) arcuate 

surfaces, the outside surface (17) having thereon a 
circumferentially outwardly extending ring (19) and the 

inside surface (15) having thereon at least one radially 
inwardly extending shelf (21); and at least one leg (25) 

connecting the neck (11) to the foot (13). The 
collar (9) provides improved safety reliability and thus 

reduces the susceptibility of health care workers to 
accidents, e.g. accidental needle strikes. In addition, 

the collar (9) can be easily and economically 
manufactured, e.g. by conventional precision injection 

molding techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a collar adapted for 
use with pre-filled cartridge-needle units and 
disposable holders to form a syringe assembly. Disposable medicament-containing cartridge 
needle units for use in conjunction with reusable 
hypodermic syringe holders are well known in the art 
and in widespread commercial use. Such cartridges 
conventionally feature a cylindrical body closed at 
the proximal end with a flexible plunger slidable 
within the bore of the cartridge and closed at the 
distal necked-down end with a septum secured to the 
cartridge by a crimped-on aluminum collar. The 
necked-down distal end conventionally is fitted with 
a needle hub/needle/sheath assembly. Such cartridge-needle 
units are available from Sanofi Winthrop 
Pharmaceuticals under the Carpuject® trademark. In use, the cartridge-needle unit must be 
activated, i.e. the proximal end of the needle 
cannula must penetrate the sealed septum such that 
communication is achieved between the fluid and the 
proximal end of the needle. Some cartridge-needle 
units are sold in an activated form. Others must be 
activated by the user. When user-activated 
cartridge-needle units are used in conjunction with 
conventional reusable syringe holders of the type 
described, for example, in Hadtke, U.S. Patent 
4,585,445 and in EP-A-0 485,028, this is accomplished 
when the health care worker advances the cartridge 
through the holder by rotating a clamping element. Many holders, including the above-referenced 
reusable holders, enable the user to avoid handling 
the cartridge-needle unit when the needle unit is 
exposed. Nevertheless, health care workers are 
especially susceptible to accidental and potentially  
 
infectious, and indeed, on occasion, possibly fatal, 
needle strikes due to the careless handling and/or 
disposing of the cartridge-needle unit after use. 
The consequences to health care workers of strikes 
from needles contaminated with various infectious 
diseases such as hepatitis or AIDS can be 
particularly severe. The frequency of such 
accidental needle strikes in the United States is 
surprisingly great, and has been estimated to be 
approximately one million strikes per year. 
Moreover, the cost to health care organizations for 
the testing of health care workers accidentally 
stricken by used needles is a significant burden on 
health care costs. Therefore, it would be desirable 
to further protect health care workers by providing 
systems which reduce the possibility of accidental 
needle strikes. To this end,

<CLAIMS>
A collar (9) adapted to fit over the 
hub (26) of an activatable cartridge-needle unit, 

characterized in that said collar (9) comprises: 
   a solid circumferential neck (11); 

   a circumferential foot (13) interrupted in at 
least one point, said foot having inside (15) and 

outside (17) arcuate surfaces, said outside 
surface (17) having thereon a circumferentially 

outwardly extending ring (19) and said inside 
surface (15) having thereon at least one radially 

inwardly extending shelf (21); and 
   at least one leg (25) connecting said neck (11) 

to said foot (13). 
A collar (9) as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
said shelf (21) extends inwardly from the inside 

surface (15) of the foot (13) at an angle of about 
90°. 
A collar (9) as claimed in either of the 
preceding claims wherein said circumferential 

foot (13) is interrupted in two points. 
A collar (9) as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims comprising six legs (25). 
A collar (9) as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims further comprising two pairs of 

ribs (23) extending longitudinally from said 
neck (11) to said foot (13). 
A collar (9), cartridge-needle unit, 
holder assembly comprising in combination, 


(1) a collar (9) as defined in any one of 
the preceding claims; 
(2) an activatable cartridge-needle unit; 
and 
(3) a holder having a body comprising 
slots (35,37) sized to accept the ring (19) on the 

foot (13) of said collar (9).
