<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims to prevent an obstacle from 
being trapped between a vehicle window and a window frame. 

A supersonic wave f is emitted into a vehicle window W. 
A reflection wave i of the supersonic wave is received 

to decide whether the reflection wave i is one reflected 
from peripheral faces of a target to be detected or not. 

If the received reflection wave i is one reflected from 
the peripheral faces from the target, a driving motor M 

for the vehicle window W is stopped. Thus, when an obstacle 
contacts with the peripheral faces of the vehicle window, 

it is possible to previously prevent the obstacle from being 
caught by the window since a driving source for the vehicle 

window is stopped.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an opening and closing
apparatus for a vehicle window which is mounted in a vehicle
such as an automobile or the like and is driven into open
and closed positions by a driving source, and to an opening
and closing method for the vehicle window in the apparatus.Recently, most automobiles are provided with an
opening and closing apparatus of a vehicle window known
as a power window which employs a motor.Since power windows can be opened and closed by
means of a switch, ease and safety of operation are assured.However, since the power window or vehicle window
is opened and closed under the driving force of a motor,
obstacles tend to become trapped between the vehicle and
the window frame and leading, on occasion, to serious
problems, accident and injury.For convenience of explanation, a conventional
opening and closing apparatus for a vehicle window will
be described by referring to FIGS. 12 and 13. FIGS. 12
and 13 show schematic constructions of conventional
different opening and closing apparatus for the vehicle
window.One of the conventional opening and closing
apparatus, as shown in FIG. 12, includes a current detector
100 which detects a primary current for a motor M driving
a vehicle window W and a control section 101 which controls
the motor M in accordance with a detecting current from the
current detector. In the case that a load is applied to
the window W against movement of the window when closing
the window W, the current detector 100 detects a surplus
current which flows in the motor M and the control section
101 suspends driving of the motor in response to detection
of the surplus current. However, as described above, in the method for
detecting the obstacle existing between the vehicle window
and the window frame relying on the detection of a surplus
current which flows in the motor M, the following problems
arise.First, since the window W is subject to an aging
strain due to door impact, a load which is applied to
the moving window upon opening and closing the window W
is variable. Also, as shown in FIG. 12, a foreign substance
A such as dust, small stones or the like tends to
become trapped between the window W and side window frames
SP. Such foreign substances A cause a load which resists
movement of the window W, thereby resulting in a surplus
current flow in the motor M. Consequently, if a value
of the surplus current at the time of stopping the motor
(hereinafter referred to as a setting value) is set to
be low, an operation of opening and closing the window

<CLAIMS>
An opening and closing control method for safe operation of a vehicle
window which is driven into open and closed positions by

a driving source, comprising the steps of:

emitting a sound wave (f) into said vehicle window;
receiving back from within said vehicle window a reflection wave (i) of said sound wave;
deciding whether or not the received reflection wave
is one caused by an obstacle contacting with a peripheral

face of said vehicle window; and
stopping or reversing an operation of said driving
source when it is decided that said received reflection

wave is one caused by contact of an obstacle.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said sound
wave to be emitted into said vehicle window is in the

form of discontinuous waves generated intermittently.
A method according to Claim 2, wherein intervals
between said discontinuous waves are changed at random.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said sound
wave to be emitted into said vehicle window is two or

more kinds of sound waves with different frequencies.
An opening and closing apparatus for a vehicle window
which is driven into open and closed positions by a driving

source (M,3,4) , comprising:

generator means (44) for generating an electrical
transmission signal (e) with a given frequency;
transmitter means (1) for converting said electrical
transmission signal into a sound wave (f) and emitting said

sound wave into said vehicle window;
receiver means (1) for receiving back from within said vehicle window a reflection sound wave (i) of said sound wave (f) and for converting said reflection sound
wave into a received

electrical signal (j);
comparator means (42) for deciding whether or not
an obstacle contacts with a peripheral face of said vehicle window in

accordance with said received electrical signal (j)
obtained by said receiver means and generating a

decision signal (n) corresponding to a decision; and 
driving controller means for stopping or reversing
said driving source for opening and closing the window.
An apparatus according to Claim 5, wherein said
transmitter means and said receiver means are provided

in a single transmitting and receiving unit and wherein
said transmitting and receiving unit is selectively

connected to said generator means of said transmission
electrical signal or said comparator means through

a switching section of transmitting and receiving.
An apparatus according to Claim 5, wherein a
bonding medium for filing in an air layer is provided

between both of said transmitter means and receiver
means and said vehicle window.
