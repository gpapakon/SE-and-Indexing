<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives and 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which possess a broad spectrum of potent 
antibacterial activities and are useful as antibacterials and to processes for preparing 
these compounds. Quinolonic antibacterials such as enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and 
tosufloxacin have been commercially available. Although most of these prior art 
quinolones are known to have relatively good antibacterial activity against gram-negative 
bacteria, they are known to have relatively weak antibacterial activity against gram-positive 
bacteria. Therefore, the development of new quinolone compounds which possess a broad 
spectrum of potent antibacterial activities and are effective against quinolone-resistant 
bacteria as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus (MRSA) is still needed. In order to solve the above problems, the present inventors have conducted extensive 
studies to develop novel quionlone compounds. As a result, it has been surprisingly found that quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives 
having the substituent represented by the following formula (A) at 7-position 
of 
quinolone nucleus meet the above requirements.  In the above formula,
 
R₁, R₂ and R₃, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen or a halogen 
atom, or a lower alkyl group substituted with an amino or hydroxy group; and
 
R₄ is hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl, benzyl, t-butoxycarbonyl or ethoxycarbonyl group. Accordingly, the present invention is concerned with novel quinolone carboxylic acid 
derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which can meet said 
requirements and with processes for preparing such compounds. An object of the present invention is to provide novel quinolone carboxylic acid 
derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which possess a broad 
spectrum of potent antibacterial activities against various microorganisms, and to 
provide processes for preparing these compounds. Another object of the present invention is to provide intermediates which are useful 
for producing the desired compounds of the present invention. The present invention provides novel quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives represented 
by the formula (I): 
wherein,
 
R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ are the same as defined above;
 
R₅ is hydrogen or chlorine atom, or methyl or an amino group;
 
R₆ is a lower alkyl group, or a cyclopropyl or a phenyl group optionally substituted with 
a halogen atom; and
 
X is nitrogen
