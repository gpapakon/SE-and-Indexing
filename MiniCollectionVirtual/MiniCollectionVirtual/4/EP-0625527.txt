<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the technical field of pressure sensitive adhesives, including
pressure sensitive adhesives at least partially prepared by photopolymerization. The present
invention is more particularly directed to pressure sensitive adhesives having improved adhesion,
particularly to silane-modified acrylic/melamine paint systems.Pressure sensitive adhesives are widely used for a multitude of purposes, such as various
sealing and attachment purposes. Pressure sensitive adhesives may be formed as supported
systems, for instance as an adhesive layer supported by a foundation material, which foundation
may be a flexible support or carrier, or a rigid body. Pressure sensitive adhesives may also be
formed as double-faced supported systems, for instance with a flexible or rigid carrier faced on
both sides with an adhesive layer. Such a carrier may itself be nonadhesive, although for certain
applications, discussed in more detail below, the carrier supporting the two adhesive layers has
itself some pressure sensitive adhesive qualities. Pressure sensitive adhesive layers vary widely
as to thickness, from a fraction of a mil i.e. 2.54 x 10-3cm (10-3 inch) to much greater
thickness. EP0539995 discloses heat-resistant pressure-sensitive
adhesive, comprising photopolymerisation product of a
composition comprising: monomer mixture, polyfunctional
(meth)acrylate as crosslinking agent, and photopolymerisation
initiator. Pressure sensitive adhesives formed substantially from acrylate copolymers are well
known in the art. For instance, certain acrylate copolymers which are both normally tacky and
yet possess a reasonable degree of internal strength are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. Re 24,906
(Ulrich) which reissued from original U.S. Patent No. 2,884,126 in December 1960.
Such copolymers are comprised of certain non-tertiary
acrylic esters copolymerized with monomers having polar groups, for instance acrylic acid,
methacrylic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, and itaconic acid. Such non-tertiary
acrylic esters generally are acrylic acid esters of non-tertiary alkyl alcohols, such alcohols having
up to 14 carbons, and further having an average of from 4 to 12 carbons. Small amounts of
other monomers may also be incorporated into such polymers. Such adhesive polymers, referred
to herein at times as acrylic ester polymer type or acrylic ester polymer(s), are commonly
formed as supported systems on a flexible support sheet or tape.Photopolymerization of pressure sensitive adhesive materials of the acrylic ester

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a pressure sensitive adhesive system
comprising:


photopolymerizing with ultraviolet radiation, a pressure-sensitive-adhesive
formulation comprising:


(i) from 55 to 99 parts by weight of at least one non-tertiary
acrylic acid

alkyl ester formed from a primary or secondary alcohol,
(ii) from 0.01 to 5 parts by weight of an organofunctional silane and/or from
1 to 45 parts by weight of a polar, copolymerizable, ethylenically-unsaturated

dimer
having a dual carboxylate moieties within a mer unit fraction that includes a single

backbone carbon,
(iii) from 0 to 44 parts by weight of a non-dimer ethylenically unsaturated
monomer having a polar group and
(iv) a photoinitiator.
The process of claim 1, further including the step of photopolymerizing a
support-layer formulation to form a support layer from 5.8 to 15.24 10
-2

cm (20 to
60 mils) thick, wherein said support-layer formulation is comprised of from 80 to

140 parts by weight of at least one non-tertiary acrylic acid alkyl ester formed from
a primary or secondary alcohol, said primary or secondary alcohol having from 4 to

12 carbons, and from 80 to 140 parts by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated
monomer having a polar group: then overlaying said support layer with a layer of

said pressure-sensitive-adhesive formulation, wherein said layer of a pressure-sensitive-adhesive
is from 2.54 to 12.7 x 10
-3
 cm (1 to 5 mils) thick; and then
photopolymerizing said pressure-sensitive-adhesive formulation.
The process of claim 1 or 2, wherein said primary or secondary alcohol has
from 6 to 10 carbons. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein said formulation contains from 5 to 30 parts by weight
of said ethylenically-unsaturated dimer, and wherein said ethylenically-unsaturated

dimer has
