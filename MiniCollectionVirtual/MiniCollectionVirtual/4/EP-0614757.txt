<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to oriented, heat-sealable polypropylene films having an improved water vapour barrier action at the same time as a considerably reduced coefficient of friction for packaging purposes, characterised in that they contain no polydimethylsiloxane and have the layer structure ABCBA, where   a) C is the core layer comprising polypropylene and a hydrocarbon resin with a molecular weight of up to about 2000 g/mol and a softening point of above 130@, and from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight of erucamide, b) B are two hydrocarbon resin-free jacket layers of highly isotactic polypropylene having an isotacticity of 
>
 94%, where the ratio between the thickness of the jacket layer and the thickness of the base layer is between 0.01 and 0.1, and c) A are two top layers of a heat-sealable polyolefin copolymer or terpolymer, where these top layers contain at least one antiblocking agent, an antistatic and, as lubricant, from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight of erucamide.

<CLAIMS>
An oriented, in particular biaxially oriented,
sealable polypropylene film having an improved water

vapour barrier effect and a considerably reduced
coefficient of friction for packaging purposes,

characterised in that it contains no
polydimethylsiloxane and has the following structure:

   A B C B A

a) wherein C is a base layer of polypropylene and
a hydrocarbon resin which has a molecular weight

of up to about 2000 g/mol and a softening point
above 130°C, and 0.05 to 0.5 wt.% of erucic

amide,
b) wherein B represents two jacket layers, which
are free from hydrocarbon resin, made from

highly isotactic polypropylene with an
isotacticity 
>
94%, wherein the ratio of the
thickness of the jacket layer to the thickness

of the base layer is between 0.01 and 0.1, and
c) wherein A represents two surface layers of a
heat-sealable polyolefin, co- or terpolymer,

wherein said surface layers comprise at least an
antiblocking agent, an antistatic agent and, as

a lubricant, 0.05 to 0.5 wt.% of erucic amide.
A sealable film according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the base layer contains a hydrocarbon resin

from the group comprising petroleum resins, terpene
resins or coal tar resins. 
A sealable film according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the hydrocarbon resin is a hydrogenated,

oligomeric cyclopentadiene resin.
A sealable film according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the surface layers

substantially comprise

random propylene/ethylene copolymer
random propylene/1-butene copolymer
random propylene/ethylene/olefin terpolymer
mixtures of two or three of the above polymers.
A sealable film according to Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the surface layers A comprise

silicon dioxide, calcium carbonate,
polymethylmethacrylate, polycarbonate, silicone or

HDPE (high density polyethylene) as an antiblocking
agent.
A sealable film according to Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the base layer C and/or the

surface layers A contain an antistatic agent.
A film according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that it has been pretreated on one

or both sides by corona, flame, plasma or fluorine
pretreatment.
Use of the sealable film according to one or more or
Claims 1 to 7 as a packaging material.
