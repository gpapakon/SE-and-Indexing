<ABSTRACT>
The conveyor belt system has a single driven belt (2). The top stringer (5) is divided into an entry (6) and discharge (7) section forming a transfer point (8) between two deflector edges (9, 10). Near the bottom stringer (4), the belt has a drive motor (3) and drive drum (11) for continuously driving the discharge section. The entry and discharge sections are held by brake drums (16, 23) over which the belt passes. A belt accumulator (31, 33) is positioned between the drive motor and entry section and between the two deflector edges respectively. Each belt accumulator has a deflector drum (14, 20) on a shared slide frame (32).
