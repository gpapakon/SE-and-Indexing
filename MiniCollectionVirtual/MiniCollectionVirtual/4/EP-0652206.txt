<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluorine-containing
carboxylic acid amine salt which can be used for lubricants of
precision machinery and precision parts in which highly accurate
lubricity is required, a surface active agent, a mold releasing
agent, and an anticorrosive agent or the like. This invention
further relates to a magnetic recording medium with the fluorine-containing
carboxylic acid amine salt thereon.Along with the advancement toward small-sized and highly
accurate machinery devices and machinery parts, the lubrication
used with sliding members is changing from fluid lubrication to
boundary lubrication. Particularly, in the field of electronics
and electronic parts such as a VTR or a magnetic disk, the use of
a ferromagnetic metallic thin film with the intention of
improving memory density requires highly accurate lubrication for
sliding a magnetic recording medium on a magnetic head. For
example, an evaporation tape and a hard disk are designed to
achieve a higher output by minimizing the spacing between a
magnetic recording medium and a magnetic head without losing
durability and reliability. Therefore, a lubricant layer
disposed on the surface of a magnetic layer is formed such that
the thickness is only several nm (10 angstroms). Thus, an 
organic compound with high lubricity which is used to form this
lubricant layer has become the major task of development.As lubricants for metallic thin film type magnetic
recording mediums, a long-chain carboxylic acid perfluoroalkyl
amine salt shown in Formula 1 below, an aliphatic carboxylic acid
with a fluoroalkylether group shown in Formula 2 below, and an
aliphatic carboxylic acid with a fluoroalkyl group shown in
Formula 3 below are disclosed due to their compatibility with
metallic thin films (Laid-open Japanese Patent Application Nos.
Hei 4-274018 and Hei 4-270243).
(Formula 1)
   C18H37COO-H3N+(CH2)10C8F17However, the lubricants shown in the above-noted Formulas
1, 2 or 3 were transferred onto a backing side when magnetic
tapes were stored in an environment of high temperature and high
humidity. The problem was that the lubricity deteriorated 
because the amount of lubricant present on the surface of the
magnetic layer decreased through this transfer. This
deterioration of lubricity becomes even more obvious as it
results in lower steel endurance.US-A-5,091,269 discloses a magnetic recording medium
containing an amine salt of carboxylic acid as the
lubricant. The amine salt of carboxylic acid may be
contained in the magnetic layer of the
