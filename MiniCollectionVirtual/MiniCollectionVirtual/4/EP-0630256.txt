<ABSTRACT>
In a tissue irrigating solution of the type containing the combination of glutathione, bicarbonate, and Ringer solution (GBR), the bicarbonate and glutathione are freeze-dried, packaged and separately stored in lyophilized powder form until just preceding the operation, at which time the lyophilized powder containing the bicarbonate and glutathione is dissolved directly into a conventional I.V. solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TISSUE IRRIGATING SOLUTION Cross Reference to Related Applications This application is a continuation-in-part of my copending application Ser. No. 577,306, filed Sept. 4, 1990 (now U.S. Patent No. , issued which, in turn, was a divisional of Ser. No. 243,085, filed Sept. 9, 1988 and issued as U.S. Patent No. 4,975,419 on Dec. 4, 1990. Field of the InventionThe present invention is directed to tissue irrigating solutions and, more particularly, to improved techniques for formulating and packaging the components of a tissue irrigating solution containing glutathione, bicarbonate, and Ringer solution.Background of the Invention During surgical procedures, it is important to minimize disturbance of the environment of tissue and cells as much as possible. A traumatic change in the environment surrounding internal cells may, for example, lead to the destruction of such cells or the destruction of the function of such cells. The destruction of cell function may even lead to destruction of other cells which are dependent upon a proper functioning of the destroyed cells. Therefore, during surgical procedures such as, for example, intraocular surgery, it is very important that the exposed tissue be continuously irrigated with solutions which approximate natural body fluids. Such solutions are called "tissue irrigating solutions". One of the earliest tissue irrigating solutions for ophthalmic procedures was an isotonic saline. However, it was quickly recognized that the isotonic saline was not adequate as an ophthalmic irrigating solution because it resulted in endothelial cell swelling, cell damage, and consequent corneal clouding.Alternatively, various electrolyte solutions have been proposed as tissue irrigating solutions, particularly in ophthalmic procedures, because such 

solutions more closely resemble the aqueous humor of the eye. .The earliest electrolyte solution was known as Ringer's solution, which was a combination of sodium, calcium and potassium ions along with sodium lactate. Another solution intended for tissue irrigation is known as a balanced salt solution (referred to as "BSS") which contains the essential sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium salt ions along with an acetate-citrate buffer system. It was successful and was used almost exclusively until several years ago. Within the last 10-15 years, there has developed a tissue irrigating solution which is a combination of the Ringer solution along with glutathione and sodium bicarbonate. This is sometimes referred to GBR, and in recent
