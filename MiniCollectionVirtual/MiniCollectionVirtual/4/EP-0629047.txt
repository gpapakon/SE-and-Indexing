<ABSTRACT>
A BiCMOS output circuit comprises an upper part (34) connected to 
a low-voltage, 

e.g., 3 volt, supply and functioning to pull an output up to the 
supply voltage 

during a high-to-low input transition, a lower part (35) connected to 
a reference potential 

such as ground and functioning to pull-down the output to the 
reference level during a 

low-to-high transition at the input, a CMOS circuit to hold the 
output state to the power 

supply, and the novel addition of a "quasi-complementary" kicker 
circuit (21,31) to both the 

upper (34) and lower parts (35) of the circuit. The effect is to provide 
low voltage cells requiring 

less drive yet operating faster than their 5-volt counterparts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to integrated circuits (ICs), and in particular to 
combined bipolar and complementary MOS (CMOS) circuits, commonly known as 
BiCMOS circuits. A trend in IC circuits is toward low-voltage circuits which can operate 
directly off of two conventional batteries. A typical voltage range is 2.7-3.6 volts. 
Another trend is toward faster circuits. The latter has resulted in the increased 
popularity of BiCMOS circuits which combine the low power characteristic of a CMOS 
circuit and the speed characteristic of the bipolar circuit. However, lowering the normal 
5-volt operating voltage to 2.7-3.6 volts inherently reduces the speed of operation. In all of the known 2.7-3.6 volt BiCMOS output circuits, the output is 
typically driven by a tandem arrangement of bipolar and CMOS circuits. The bipolar 
output part drives the load during the typical high-to-low transition, while the CMOS 
part holds the output state to the power supply levels and provides all the current for the 
DC specifications. Some changes from the typical 5-volt IC's also include the removal 
of the Darlington transistors from the bipolar pull-up circuit and the new "quasi-complementary" 
structure that allows functionality and performance at very low supply 
voltages. However, when the power supply is reduced to 2.7-3.6 volts, incorporating 
these changes causes the bipolar transistors to be under-driven as compared to their 5-volt 
counterparts. The result is lower operating performance. An object of the invention is an improved BiCMOS circuit. A further object of the invention is a high speed BiCMOS 
capable of operating off of low supply voltages. Still another object of the invention is a low voltage BiCMOS output  
 
circuit requiring less drive than, yet operating faster than, their 5-volt counterparts. The electronic device in the invention comprises a BiCMOS output circuit 
including an input, an output, first CMOS logic gate means, e.g., an inverter, 
connected between the input and the output, a pull-up bipolar transistor device and a 
pull-down bipolar transistor device interconnected via the output. The circuit further 
comprises pull-up control means connected between the input and a control node of the 
pull-up device, and pull-down control means connected between the input and a further 
control node of the pull-down device. The pull-up control means comprises second 
CMOS logic gate means, e.g., an inverter, between the input and the control node of 
the pull-up device. The pull-down control means
