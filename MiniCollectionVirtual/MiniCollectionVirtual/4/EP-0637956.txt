<ABSTRACT>
2-amino-N-(1,2-diphenyl-1-methylethyl)acetamide (remacemide) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and L-dopa, are useful in conjuction with one another in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Pharmaceutical products and formulations comprising these active agents are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel method of treatment of patients suffering from Parkinson's
disease, the novel use of a known compound in the treatment of Parkinson's disease,
and to pharmaceutical products and formulations for use in that treatment.Parkinson's disease is thought to be caused by arteriosclerotic changes in the basal ganglia
and is characterized by rhythmical muscular tremors and rigidity of movement.European Patent Application 279937 discloses 2-amino-N-(1,2-diphenyl-1-methylethyl)-acetamide
(hereinafter referred to as "remacemide") and its pharmaceutically acceptable
salts, and their use as anti-epileptic agents. European Patent Application 427427 discloses
the use of remacemide and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the treatment
of neurodegenerative diseases: however, their use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease
is not mentioned. Remacemide and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are
thought to be non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists.3-Hydroxy-L-tyrosine (hereinafter referred to as "L-dopa") is a well known agent for use
in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.The use of NMDA antagonists to potentiate the antiparkinsonian action of L-dopa in
monoamine-depleted rats has been disclosed by Klockgether et al (Annals of Neurology,
vol 28, No 4, p539, 1990).It has now been found that administration of remacemide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof, in conjunction with L-dopa, to a patient suffering from Parkinson's
disease is particularly beneficial. Remacemide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof, may also be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease on its own.Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided:
the use of remacemide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as active ingredient
in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of Parkinson's disease; and a pharmaceutical product containing remacemide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof, and L-dopa, as a combined preparation for separate, simultaneous or sequential
use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.The administration of the active agents (ie remacemide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof, and L-dopa) in conjunction with one another is advantageous because,
for example, the therapeutic effect of L-dopa is particularly enhanced, permitting the
therapeutic effect of L-dopa to be achieved at a dosage level below that normally
employed, thus allowing the unwanted side effects of L-dopa (for example neurotoxicity)
to be
