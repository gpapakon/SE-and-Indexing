<ABSTRACT>
A power supply circuit 
for an electric discharge machine 

characterized in that 
since an inductance element is 

shorted by a second switching 
element at the time of building 

up a machining current, an increase 
of the time constant due 

to the inductance element is 
not caused, and thereby the 

build-up of the current wave 
shape of the machining current 

does not become wrong, and in 
that since the inductance element 

acts after building up the 
machining current, the intermission 

of the machining current 
is not caused.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a power 
supply circuit for an electric discharge machine. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a power 
supply circuit for an EDM machine which reduces machining 
current cutoff without degrading the machining current 
waveform. An electric discharge machine ("EDM"), such as 
that described in JP-A 58-40225, has a 
transistor switch placed between the gap and the power 
source. The transistor switch is periodically turned on and 
off for short predetermined periods which defines a 
machining cycle. Within the "on" time of a machining cycle, 
the transistor may be intermittently triggered on and off. 
The intermittent turning on and off of the switching 
transistor maintains a generally continuous machining 
current.  
 When conditions are such that the machining 
current should be lowered during the predetermined "on" 
time, the current is cutoff. Therefore, the actual "on" 
time during a machining cycle is less than the predetermined 
value of "on" time. This premature cutting-off of the 
machining current results in reduced machining speed and in 
faster wear down of the electrodes. JP-B 62-5733, discloses a circuit 
where the machining current cutoff can be eliminated by the 
insertion of an inductor in series with the gap. Although 
this inductor reduces the machining current cutoff, it also 
increases the time constant of the circuit. The increased 
time constant causes the rise time of the machining current 
to increase. This in turn causes a drastic reduction in the 
machining speed, which is the exact opposite of the desired 
effect. A further Japanese Patent No. JP-B 52-19359 describes a power 
supply for an electric discharge machine comprising an 
inductor connected serially with the tool electrode of the 
gap. Parallel to this inductor is arranged a switchable 
bypass of small inductance. The bypass is used to shorten 
the pulse length of the machining current pulses in cutting 
away rise times and decay times of the currents flowing 
through the inductor. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a power supply circuit for an EDM machine which 
reduces machining current cutoff without increasing the rise 
time of the machining current.  
 It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide an EDM power supply circuit which minimizes 
machining current cutoff without causing an undesirable 
increase in machining current rise time due to an 
inductance. These and other objects of the present invention 
are
