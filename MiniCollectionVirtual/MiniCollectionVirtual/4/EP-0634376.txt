<ABSTRACT>
To improve the quality of a system of layers deposited on a substrate such as a window glazing, the system of layers comprising a surface layer based on oxides, in particular semiconductor oxides of the n type, such as SnOx, the substrate is subjected to IR irradiation. In this way a stabilisation of the layer is obtained which is equivalent to or better than that with a residence in the atmosphere for 48 hours. The IR radiation preferably has a maximum at 2.5  mu m and the power is between 1 and 90 kW/m

Method of producing a substrate comprising at least 
one metallic oxide film, using a deposition method 

under vacuum such as cathodic sputtering, after which 
a thermal treatment is carried out, characterized in 

that the treatment is a stabilization treatment for 
the film of metallic oxide under controlled 

conditions and in that it includes irradiation of the 
surface of the substrate with infrared light having a 

wavelength greater than 1.5 µm, in particular with a 
maximum of approximately 2.5 µm. 
Production method according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the irradiation of the substrate is performed 

immediately after it has left the vacuum deposition 
line. 
Production method according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the substrate is of float glass 

and the irradiation is performed with a power lying 
between 1 kW/m
2
 and 90 kW/m
2
, in such a way that the 
substrate does not exceed a temperature of 

approximately 100°C. 
Production method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the duration of the irradiation 

depends upon its power and that it lies between 10 
seconds and 5 minutes. 
Production method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the metallic oxide film is of 

SnO
x
 or a semiconductor oxide of the n type or 
belonging to the group comprising the oxides of 

silicon, aluminium, magnesium, zirconium, niobium, 
zinc, tantalum and titanium.
