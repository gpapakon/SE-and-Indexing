<ABSTRACT>
The filter discs (12, 13) of the filter device are provided on both sides of a filter chamber (34) which surrounds annularly or in the form of a spiral a discharge chamber (5) closed on the intake side. For periodic cleaning, a suction nozzle (14, 15) for solids particles filtered out is arranged on each filter disc (12, 13), which suction nozzle extends over the radial width of the filter disc (12, 13). During cleaning, a drive (20, 21) rotates the discharge chamber (5) with the filter chamber (34) attached to it, so that the filter discs move along the suction nozzles (14, 15). In the case of a spiral filter chamber (34), only one pair of suction nozzles (14, 15) is necessary in that these are displaced along a guide rod by the rotary motion of the filter chamber (34). The rotary motion of the filter chamber (34) in one direction brings one of the filter discs (12, 13) to abut with one of the suction nozzles (14, 15). The other is closed during this by an isolating valve (45). An outwardly tapering cross-sectional shape of the filter chamber (34) enables engagement of the suction nozzles (14, 15) in the case of a small pitch of the threaded shape of the filter chamber (34) or in the case of a close arrangement of a plurality of filter chambers axially adjacently arranged. Thus, no special drive is necessary for moving a suction nozzle over the filter surface and the filter device, in relation to its size, has a large filter surface area.

Filter device for removing solid particles from a gas, 
with a casing (1) having an inlet and an outlet (2,3) and 

in which are located filter disks (12,13), two of them form 
the lateral boundary of a filter chamber (34), which is 

connected to and surrounds a hollow cylindrical outflow 
chamber (5) mounted in rotary manner and connected to a 

rotary drive (20,21), whereby on both sides of the filter 
chamber (34) is provided one suction nozzle (14,15) of a 

suction device for removing solid particles from the filter 
disks (12,13), characterized in that the filter chamber (34) 

in a helical manner surrounds the outflow chamber (5), the 
suction nozzles (14,15) of the suction device extends over 

the radial width of the filter disks (12,13) and a nozzle 
carrier (36) is guided parallel to the rotation axis of the 

outflow chamber (5). 
Filter device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that outflow chamber (5), which is closed on the inflow side 

and open on the outflow side has evenly distributed 
connecting openings (11') to the filter chamber (34). 
Filter device according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the filter chamber (34) has a radially outwardly 

tapering cross-section. 
Filter device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the casing (1) of the device spacedly 

surrounds the filter chamber (34), an outflow-side partition 
(34) of the casing (1) surrounding in sealing manner the 

rotary outflow chamber (5). 
Filter device according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the filter disks (12,13) have several 

circumferentially interconnected disk elements, so that they 
have the shape of ring sectors, the disk elements being 

detachably fixed along their edges to hub or rim-like frame  
 

parts (32,33) of a support frame (31) of the filter chamber 
(34). 
Filter device according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the disk elements are fixed to the frame parts by means 

of Velcro strip fasteners (22). 
Filter device according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that two suction nozzles (14,15) are fixed 

to a common nozzle carrier (36), which is guided both on the 
helical filter chamber (34) and on a guide surface (38) 

parallel to the rotation axis of the outflow chamber (5).
