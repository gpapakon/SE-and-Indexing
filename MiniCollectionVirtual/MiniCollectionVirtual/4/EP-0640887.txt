<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus in which contaminants are removed from an electrode wire (42) 
positioned between a donor roller (40) and a photoconductive surface (12) during 

development of an electrostatic latent image on the surface. A magnetic roller (46) is adapted 
to transport developer material to the donor roller. The electrode wire is electrostatically 

biased (50,89,90) with respect to the donor roller to remove contaminants therefrom. The 
electrostatic wire bias polarity corresponds with the contaminant charge polarity to repel the 

contaminants from the wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the development of electrostatic latent images,
and more particularly concerns a scavengeless development system in which an electrostatic
bias is applied to the electrode wires.This invention can be used in the art of electrophotographic printing. Generally, the
process of electrophotographic printing includes charging a photoconductive member to a
substantially uniform potential so as to sensitize the surface thereof. The charged portion of
the photoconductive surface is exposed to a light image of an original document being
reproduced. This records an electrostatic latent image on the photoconductive surface. After
the electrostatic latent image is recorded on the photoconductive surface, the latent image is
developed by bringing a developer material into contact therewith. Two-component and
single-component developer materials are commonly used. A typical two-component developer
material comprises magnetic granules having toner particles adhering triboelectrically thereto.
A single component developer material typically comprises toner particles. Toner particles are
attracted to the latent image forming a toner powder image on the photoconductive surface.
The toner powder image is subsequently transferred to a copy sheet. Finally, the toner powder
image is heated to permanently fuse it to the copy sheet in image configuration.Single-component development systems use a donor roll for transporting charged
toner to the development nip defined by the donor roll and photoconductive surface. The
toner is developed on the latent image recorded on the photoconductive member by a
combination of mechanical and/or electrical forces. Scavengeless development and jumping
development are two types of single-component developments. A scavengeless development
system uses a donor roll with a plurality of electrode wires closely spaced therefrom in the
development zone. An AC voltage is applied to the wires forming a toner cloud in the
development zone. The electrostatic field generated by the latent image attracts toner from
the toner cloud to develop the latent image. In jumping development, an AC voltage is
applied to the donor roll detaching toner from the donor roll and projecting the toner toward
the photoconductive member so that the electrostatic fields generated by the latent image
attract the toner to develop the latent image. Single-component development systems appear
to offer advantages of low cost and design simplicity. Two-component development systems
have been used
