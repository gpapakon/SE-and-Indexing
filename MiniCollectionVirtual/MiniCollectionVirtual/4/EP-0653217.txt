<ABSTRACT>
The medical infusion or transfusion apparatus comprises a drip chamber (9) with insertion part (2), filter (7) and venting part (4) with air filter (5), and a tube (15) having a flow regulator (6) for connection of the outflow of the drip chamber with a connection piece (22) at its other end. This apparatus is to be designed such that it can be used several times for up to 100 hours. This is achieved by the following measures:   1. a valve member (8) for sealing the outflow of the drip chamber if it runs dry is provided on the outflow of the drip chamber; 2. the insertion part (2) is provided with a sharp, smooth tip for multiple piercing of corresponding stoppers; 3. the air filter (5) of the venting part (4) is protected by a venting valve (6) against wetting with moisture; and 4. a non-return valve (23) is provided in the region of the connection piece.
