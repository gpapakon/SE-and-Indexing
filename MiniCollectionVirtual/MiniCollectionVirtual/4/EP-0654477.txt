<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a purchased commodity 
accommodating and transporting apparatus having a self 

scanning function and a POS system which prevent an 
unjust act such as to carry out a commodity without 

reading a commodity code whether it is intentional or 
accidental. The purchased commodity accommodating and 

transporting apparatus comprises a commodity code 
reading section (2) for reading a commodity code (50a) 

applied to a commodity (50), an accommodation section 
(3) for accommodating therein a commodity (50) whose 

commodity code (50a) has been read, a weighing equipment 
(4) for measuring the total weight of commodities (50) 

accommodated in the accommodation section (3), a weight 
determination section (5) for detecting the 

increase/decrease of the total weight of the commodities 
(50) in the accommodation section (3), and an alarm 

generation section (6) responsive to a result of the 
detection for generating an alarm when the total weight 

of the commodities (50) has increased without reading a 
commodity code (50a).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a purchased commodity
accommodating and transporting apparatus such as a
shopping cart (hand cart) or a shopping basket for use
in the distribution industry, particularly in a store
such a mass sales store, a convenience store or a
supermarket to allow a customer to accommodate and
transport a purchased commodity, and more particularly
to a purchased commodity accommodating and transporting
apparatus having a self scanning function to allow a
customer to purchase a commodity while the customer
itself reads a commodity code such as a bar code applied
to the commodity and also to a POS (Point Of Sales)
system to which such purchased commodity accommodating
and transporting apparatus having a self scanning
function is applied.Generally, a POS system is employed in various
stores such as supermarkets and convenience stores. In
the POS system, a customer walks around in a store
pushing a shopping cart or carrying a shopping basket, 
places commodities to be purchased into the shopping
cart or the shopping basket, and comes to a settlement
POS terminal (POS register).Then at the settlement POS terminal, an operator
takes out the commodities one by one from the shopping
cart or the shopping basket and reads the bar codes
(commodity codes) applied to the commodities by means of
a scanner to effect registration processing. In
particular, in accordance with commodity code
information read from each bar code, the price of the
commodity corresponding to the commodity code is
retrieved from a commodity price file (PLU (Price Look
Up) file), and a total amount of money of the purchased
commodities is calculated to settle the accounts.With such POS system, however, since an operator
must perform a reading operation of a commodity code of
each commodity, much time is required for such reading
operation and a settling operation, which causes the
customer to wait for a long time. Accordingly, in a
time band in which customers are crowded, a queue of
customers is produced in front of a settlement POS
terminal, and besides, the burden on the operator is
heavy.Thus, in recent years, a shopping cart (scanning
cart) or a shopping basket having a scanner (commodity
code reading section) for reading a bar code (commodity
code) applied to a commodity has been developed and are 
disclosed in various publications including, for
example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Applications No.
Showa 63-145591, No. Heisei 2-277412 and No. Heisei 5-81559.In a POS system which employs a shopping cart or
a shopping basket

<CLAIMS>
A purchased commodity accommodating and
transporting apparatus having a self scanning function

and comprising:

a commodity code reading section (2) for reading a
commodity code (50a) applied to a commodity (50);
an accommodation section (3) for accommodating
therein a commodity (50) whose commodity code (50a) has

been read by said commodity code reading section (2);
a weighing equipment (4) for measuring the total
weight of commodities (50) accommodated in said

accommodation section (3);
a weight determination section (5) for defecting the
variation of the total weight of the commodities (50)

in said accommodation section (3) measured by said
weighing equipment (4); and
an alarm generation section (6) for generating an
alarm when it is determined by said weight

determination section (5) that the total weight of the
commodities (50) in said accommodation section (3)

measured by said weighing equipment (4) has changed
without reading a commodity code (50a) by said

commodity code reading section (2);

   
characterised in that
 the purchased commodity
accommodating and transporting apparatus further

comprises:

a timer (9) for counting an alarm generation time
by said alarm generation section (6);
