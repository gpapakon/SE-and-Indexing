<ABSTRACT>
Welded radiators (1) of the flat variety, with an inflow and outflow pipe (2, 3) are manufactured from ST 37 steel. A radiator of this kind is particularly attractive and has a high degree of pressure strength if it is fitted with ties (6, 7) as reinforcing bars (10, 11) running in the direction of flow (8) of the hot water, said reinforcing bars having welding projections (18, 19) at intervals on both sides, thus enabling them to be placed at virtually any point. This allows the radiator (1) to be given any degree of pressure strength desired. A pressure-sealed tubular element (112) which both connects and passes through the two panels (4, 5) is provided for the connecting cables (106) from the measuring instruments (105) attached to the front panel and facilitates computer controlled reading of those instruments.
