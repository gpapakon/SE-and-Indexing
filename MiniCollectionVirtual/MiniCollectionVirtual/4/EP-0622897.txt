<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a heat and weather resistant and
miniaturized surface acoustic wave device, and a method of
manufacturing the same. More particularly, the invention relates
to a surface acoustic wave device used for a filter, which passes
only electric information at a particular frequency, and the
like.Along with the recent development of mobile communication
equipment, the miniaturization of a surface acoustic wave device
has been requested. A surface acoustic wave element in the
device is an element for converting electric information to
mechanical information and then converting only necessary surface
information to electric information.A conventional surface acoustic wave device is
manufactured as follows:
preparing a substrate, which has an inter digital
transducer (IDT) for input-output and pads used for leading
electrodes on the surface;placing and gluing the substrate to a metal or ceramic
case;wire bonding the lead electrodes; andcovering the case with a metal or ceramic lid.More specifically, the conventional surface acoustic wave
device is shown in Figs. 22 (a), 22 (b) and 22 (c). In these
Figs., 221 indicates a substrate; 222 is an IDT; 223 is a pad;
224 indicates a ceramic case; 225 shows an input-output terminal;
226 is a ground terminal; 227 indicates a bonding wire; 228 is an
adhesive; and 229 indicates a lid.In this conventional surface acoustic wave device,
however, the wall of the case is required to be thick enough to
glue the lid on sufficiently. As a result, even if the size of
the substrate is small, the size of the device as a whole cannot
be miniaturized. For example, a small ceramic package of a
conventional surface acoustic wave device is 5mm wide × 5mm long ×
1.2mm thick. In other words, it has been difficult to
miniaturize a surface acoustic wave device.Moreover, the quality of the adhesive which is used to
fix the substrate and glue the lid to the case is changed with
heat, and the vapor of the adhesive is generated at high
temperature such as by soldering or the like. This produces
negative effects on the frequency characteristics of the wave
filter, and the long-term stability of the surface acoustic wave
device is lowered.In order to solve the problems of conventional surface
acoustic wave devices,
JP-A-1-97006, for instance, discloses a surface 
acoustic wave device comprising a glass container. By using a
glass container instead of a ceramic or metal case, an adhesive
is not required to glue a lid, thus lessening the negative
effects of the adhesive on the
