<ABSTRACT>
The oven according to the invention comprises an upper opening (11) formed in the top of enclosure (1) and connected to a pipe (12) which carries the excess steam away to a condensation box (14) positioned in the bottom portion of the oven. A constant level of water (18) is maintained in the condensation box (14), and a siphon (22) draws off the excess liquid into a drainpipe (7) leading from the steam generator to an outflow pipe (9). A steam evacuating pipe (26) fitted with a superheater (27) evacuates any excess steam not condensed in the condensation box (14). This avoids putting out too much steam from the oven into the atmosphere and/or into the outflow pipes (9).

Oven for cooking foodstuffs including an airtight enclosure 
(1) having an opening closed by a door (100), with a condensed water 

capture circuit (31, 170, 32, 14, 22) having a lower hole (31) for 
collecting in the lower part of said enclosure (1) water condensing in 

said enclosure and for discharging same through a conduction pipe (170) 
into discharge pipes (9), an excess steam circuit (11, 12) for capturing 

excess steam escaping from said enclosure (1) and for feeding the captured 
steam to treatment means including steam condenser means (14) containing 

water at a predetermined level (18) to convert steam into liquid 
condensates, means (22, 7) for collecting said liquid condensates and for 

removing them through discharge pipes (9),
 
characterised in that : 


said means for collecting and treating excess steam (11, 12, 14, 22) are 
separate from means for collecting condensed water (31, 170, 32, 14, 22), 

and include an upper orifice (11) in an upper part of said enclosure (1) 
and connected to an excess steam pipe (12) to convey excess steam 

collected from an upper part of said enclosure to a connection orifice 
(13) in steam condensation means (14) in the lower part of the oven, 
said treatment means (11, 12, 14, 22) include at least one heater (27), 
adapted to heat steam passing through it, and set in the excess steam 

circuit on the upstream side or on the downstream side of the steam 
condenser means (14). 
Oven according to claim 1, characterised in that said heater 
(27) is adapted to heat steam passing through it to a temperature between 

approximately 300°C and 500°C. 
Oven according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that said 
steam condenser means include a condensation box (14) with two 

compartments (15, 16) one on top of the other and separated by an 
apertured intermediate wall (17) with means for feeding water into the 

lower compartment (16) and for maintaining it at the predetermined level 
(18). 
Oven according to claim 3, characterised in that the upper 
compartment (15) of said condensation box (14) includes said orifice (13) 

for connection to said excess steam pipe (12) and contains rocks (19). 
Oven according to any of claims 2 to 4, characterised in 
that said condensation box (14) includes a siphon (22) connected to said  

 
drain pipe (7) and adapted t
o carry away excess liquid above said 
predetermined level (18), the inlet (23) of said siphon (22) facing 

downwards and being at a level lower than said predetermined level (18) 
and near the bottom (160) of said lower compartment (16). 
Oven according to any of claims 4 or 5, characterised in 
that it comprises means (20, 21) for feeding cold water into said 

condensation box (14) at predetermined periods to cool it. 
Oven according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that said condensation box (14) is connected to a steam outlet pipe (26) 

to vent to atmosphere excess steam not condensed in said condensation box 
(14). 
Oven according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that said steam pipe (12) includes a heater (27). 
Oven according to claim 7, characterised in that said steam 
outlet pipe (26) includes a heater (27). 
Oven according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterised in 
that it includes a steam generator device (2), a drain pump (6) and drain 

pipes (7) adapted to drain off water contained in said steam generator 
device (2) and to feed it into said discharge pipes (9), said drain pipes 

(7) being connected to a condensate outlet pipe (22) to aspirate the 
content of said steam condenser means (14) during draining. 
Oven according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterised in 
that it includes a steam generator device (2), a first drain pump (6) and 

drain pipes (7) adapted to drain off water from said steam generator 
device (2) and to feed it into an outlet storage tank (28) connected to 

said discharge pipes (9) by a second drain pump (29) enabling output into 
discharge pipes (9) at a higher level than the oven, said drain pipes (7) 

being connected to a condensate outlet pipe (22) to aspirate the content 
of said steam condenser means (14) during draining.
