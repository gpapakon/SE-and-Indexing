<ABSTRACT>
In each cell of a mobile radio system with code division multiple access, a power control 
based on the carrier/interference ratio of each mobile station is carried out on the base-to-mobile 

link. Power control is carried out by a device (CP) which is associated to the base station (SB) and 
which, for a whole period during which the carrier/interference ratios do not vary, assigns to each 

traffic channel towards the active mobile stations (M₁...M
N
) a fraction 

Pi= a
i
P/N 
 
 (N = number of 

the active mobile stations) of the total power P available for transmission of traffic information to 
the mobile stations. That fraction is determined so as to equalize the carrier/interference ratios of all 

the mobile stations and to keep constant the total power for a given number of active channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mobile communications systems and in particular
to a method and a device for power control in the base-to-mobile link of a mobile radio system
using direct sequence-code division multiple access (DS-CDMA).It is known that according to this technique the binary information sequences
individually generated by the users are multiplied by a respective very long pseudo-random
sequence whose elements have a period (chip time) much smaller than the bit time of the information
sequences, so that the energy of the signals from each user is uniformly spread over the whole
system band. The pseudo-random sequence is typical of the user and represents a code for the same.
The spread spectrum signals thus obtained are added together and sent to all users. At the receiving
side, the information is recovered through decorrelation operations, by taking advantage of the code
sequence. This technique helps keeping communication secrecy.An essential requisite of a system using this technique is power control, which is
particularly critical in the mobile-to-base link, and yet is also necessary in the base-to-mobile link
in order not to affect the system capacity in comparison with the other link, for a given transmission
quality. In fact, in the mobile-to-base link it is essential that the signals sent towards
the base station from different mobile stations locked thereto arrive at the base station
ideally with the same power, because in the absence of power control the signals from
a mobile station near the base station could completely mask the signals from a farther
out mobile station. To face this problem (commonly called "near-far problem" in the art)
high dynamics is required for power control, even in excess of 80 dB. In the base-to-mobile
link, power control is less critical, as each mobile station receives from its base
station a signal which is the sum of the useful signal (the signal actually intended for the
mobile station itself) and of interfering signals (those intended for all other mobile
stations): both the useful signal and the interfering signals follow the same path within
the cell, and there is no such problem as explained above. However, the interference due
to signals from the base stations of adjacent cells must be taken into account, and it was
seen that only by applying power control in the base-to-mobile link too a carrier/interference
ratio (i. e. the ratio between the power of the useful signal and the sum
of the powers of the interfering signals) of the same
