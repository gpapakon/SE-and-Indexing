<ABSTRACT>
An optically-purified enantiomer of the lactone 4-hydroxy-2-oxabicyclo-[3.3.0]oct-7-en-3-one or an acylate thereof can be obtained by biotransformation. It is a useful synthon in the preparation of an enantiomer of 3-hydroxymethyl-2-hydroxycyclopentene that can be used to prepare carbocyclic nucleosides as a desired enantiomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chiral cyclopentene 
derivatives and also to their preparation and use. In 
single enantiomer form, hydroxylated cyclopentene 
derivatives are valuable precursors to carbocyclic 
nucleosides and to cholesterol-lowering agents. WO-A-9218444 describes such enantiomers, of 
2-hydroxymethyl-4-hydroxycyclopentene, and their synthesis. 
The first synthetic step is a Prins addition reaction of 
formaldehyde and formic acid onto cyclopentadiene. The 
adduct is a mixture of isomers which are separated 
chromatographically as appropriately protected derivatives 
and resolved in enzyme-mediated transformations. The same reaction is described by Sackville-Stones etal, JCS Perkin Trans. I (1991) 2603. Enantiomers of 
3-hydroxymethyl-2-hydroxycyclopentene are described as a 
minor product. The chiral cyclopentene derivatives are 
useful as synthons in the preparation of carbocyclic 
nucleosides such as Carbovir. However, a difficulty with 
this methodology is the problematic requirement for 
separation of regioisomers and diastereoisomers in addition 
to the enantiomers. Lubineau et al, Tet. Lett. 32(51):7529-30 (1991), 
describe the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of cyclopentadiene 
with glyoxylic acid, to give an α-hydroxy-γlactone, 
specifically 4-hydroxy-2-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]oct-7-en-3-one. 
This adduct has been used, as a mixture of 
diastereoisomers, in the synthesis of (±)-sesbanimides; see 
Grieco et al, JCS Chem. Commun. (1992) 568. The present invention is based on the discovery that 
the known lactone (which is produced from starting 
materials that are cheap and readily-available) can be 
resolved by biotransformation and that the resultant 
enantiomer can be used to produce the known hydroxylated  
 
cyclopentene derivatives in enantiomeric form, i.e. ready 
for use as a synthon in the preparation of a desired 
enantiomer of Carbovir or other carbocyclic nucleosides. As indicated above, the adduct of cyclopentadiene and 
glyoxylic acid has previously been produced as a racemate. 
The present invention provides methods for its 
transformation into single or at least substantially pure 
(e.g. more than 50% ee) enantiomer material of greater 
utility. In one aspect of the invention, the adduct (which is 
a mixture of diastereoisomers owing to the configuration of 
the secondary hydroxyl fraction) is resolved to give a 
desired enantiomer. The adduct may be recrystallised to 
provide a single diastereoisomer that is the major 
component of the original mixture, but this is often 
unnecess
