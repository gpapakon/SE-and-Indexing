<ABSTRACT>
A system to connect and retain a first member with a 
second member. The first member has a mounting section 

with two arms (22, 23) and a bridge (24) between the arms. 
the arms (22, 23) are canted towards each other in a 

general cantilever fashion and are deflectable outward 
from each other. The bridge (24) extends between middle 

sections of the two arms and is deflectable as the arms 
are moved outward. The bridge can be collapsed to retain 

the arms (22, 23) in their outward position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to retaining two 
members together and, in particular, to a system 
for connecting to members to each other by use of a 
collapsible bridge. U.S. Patent 2,329,471 discloses an electrical 
terminal with teeth that are driven into walls of a 
support as feet are bent. U.S. Patent 2,933,007 
discloses an insert member that has teeth. A screw 
expands sides of the insert and can contact a 
bottom cantilever. U.S. Patent 5,147,227 discloses 
a terminal retention device with nibs. U.S. Patent 
5,073,119 discloses an electrical contact with a 
base section having compliant spring sections and 
projections. In accordance with one embodiment of the present 
invention, a retention device is provided 
comprising two arms and a bridge extending between 
middle sections of the two arms. The two arms are 
canted towards each other in a general cantilever 
fashion and are reflectable outward from each 
other. The bridge is deflectable as the arms are 
moved outward from each other. In accordance with another embodiment of the 
present invention, a retention device is provided 
comprising a first end, and a second end with a  
 
mounting section. The mounting section has arms 
connected by a bridge. The arms form an open top 
area therebetween, have bottom sections connected 
to the first end, and have barbs on their exterior. 
The bridge extends between middle sections of the 
arms and is permanently deformable to retain the 
arms at a predetermined position. In accordance with another embodiment of the 
present invention, a retention system for 
connecting two members to each other, the system 
having a mounting section on a first one of the 
members for mounting the first member in a hole of 
a second one of the members is provided. The 
mounting section comprises deflectable arms adapted 
to be wedged apart and a bridge located between the 
arms. The arms have barbs at their exterior 
adapted to penetrate the second member when the 
arms are wedged apart. The bridge has a top 
section adapted to be contacted by a tool and a 
bottom stabilizer section. The bridge is 
deformable by the tool pressing on the top section 
to thereby retain the arms in a wedged apart 
position. The stabilizer section is adapted to 
prevent the bridge from twisting as the bridge is 
being deformed. The foregoing aspects and other features of the 
invention are explained in the following 
description, taken in connection with the 
accompanying drawings, wherein:

<CLAIMS>
A retention device comprising: 
two arms (22, 23) canted towards each other in a 

general cantilever fashion and being deflectable 
outward from each other; and 

a bridge (24) extending between middle portions of the 
two arms (22, 23), the bridge (24) being deflectable as 

the arms (23, 24) are moved outward from each other. 
A device as in claim 1 wherein the arms (22, 23) 
include barbs (32) on their exterior. 
A device as in claim 1 wherein the bridge (24) is 
adapted to be expanded and collapsed to permanently 

deform the bridge (24) and retain the arms (22, 23) at 
a mounted position. 
A device as in claim 3 wherein the bridge (24) includes 
a top contact section (42) adapted to be contacted by a 

tool T and pushed on to expand and collapse the bridge 
(24). 
A device as in claim 3 wherein the bridge (24) includes 
a bottom stabilizer section (44) adapted to prevent the 

bridge from twisting as the arms (22, 23) are moved 
outward. 
A device as in claim 4 wherein the top contact (42) 
section includes built-in wedge (66, 67) section 

adapted to wedge the arms (22, 23) apart. 
A device as in claim 1 wherein the mounting section is 
comprised of a single piece of sheet metal. 
A retention device comprising: 
a first end; and 

a second end with a mounting section, the mounting 
section having arms (52, 53) connected by a bridge 

(54), the arms forming an open top area therebetween 
having bottom sections connected to the first end, the 

arms having barbs on their exterior, and the bridge 
(54) extending between middle sections of the arms 

(52, 53) and being permanently deformable to retain 
the arms (52, 53) at a predetermined position. 
A device as in claim 8 wherein the brdige (54) has a 
general "V" shaped bridging section that is adapted to 

be collapsed into a general "W" shape. 
A device as in claim 8 wherein the bridge has a 
stabilizer section (62) to prevent a bridging section 

from twisting. 
A device as in claim 8 wherein the bridge (54) 
includes a built-in wedge section (64). 
A device as in claim 8 wherein top sections and the 
middle sections of the arms (52, 53) are canted 

towards each other. 
A device as in claim 8 wherein the mounting section is 
comprised of a single piece of sheet metal. 
A retention system for connecting two members to each 
other, the system having a mounting section on a first 

one of the members for mounting the first member in a 
hole (12) of a second one (14) of the members, the 

mounting section comprising: 
deflectable arms (22, 23; 52, 53) adapted to be wedged 

apart, the arms (22, 23) having barbs (32, 56) at 
their exterior adapted to penetrate the second member 

(14) when the arms are wedged apart; and 
a bridge (24, 54) located between the arms having a 

top section adapted to be contacted by a tool (T) and 
a bottom stabilizer section, the bridge being 

deformable by the tool pressing on the top section to 
thereby retain the arms in a wedged apart position and 

the stabilizer (44, 62) section being preventing the 
bridge from twisting as the bridge is being deformed. 
A system as in claim 14 wherein the top section of the 
bridge (54) has a built-in wedge section (64). 
A system as in claim 14 wherein the bridge has a 
bridging section (54) with a general "V" shape that is 

adapted to be expanded and collapsed into a gernal "W"
