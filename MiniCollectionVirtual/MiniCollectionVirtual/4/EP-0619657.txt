<ABSTRACT>
Optical circuit for a measuring system for measuring the reflection 
sensitivity of an optical transmission network, comprising a first and a second 

connection point (1, 4) for a first and a second optical signal source (S1, S2), 
respectively, a third connection point (2) for optical receiving means (R), 

optical reflection means (RF), and coupling means. The coupling means 
consist of a first waveguide junction (C2) via which the second connection 

point (4) is coupled in the forward signal direction to the reflection means, 
and a second waveguide junction (C1) via which the first connection point 

(1) is coupled in the forward signal direction to the third connection point. 
The two junctions are coupled in such a way that the reflection means are 

coupled in the forward signal direction to the third connection point via the 
first and second junctions. 
Advantages: All the effects on which the reflection sensitivity of an 
optical transmission system depends, can be influenced, as far as possible 

separately and to a sufficient degree. Signal sources to be connected are not 
coupled in the forward signal direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of measuring systems with respect to the
quality of optical transmission systems. It relates to an optical circuit for a
measuring system for measuring the sensitivity of an optical transmission
system involving reflections and Rayleigh backscattering, and a measuring
system of the said type provided with such an optical circuit.An optical transmission line in a passive optical network, as
implemented, for example, by a glass fibre, is suitable for the transmission of
optical signals in two directions, which makes it unnecessary, in principle, to
provide a separate line for the return path. In the case of bidirectional use
there is, however, the risk of crosstalk between the optical signals in the two
directions, owing to the discrete reflections and reflections by Rayleigh
backscattering, as a result of which the performance of the optical
transmission system in which the transmission line is incorporated, is
adversely affected. Such reflections lead to receiver sensitivity degradation
and represent an additional burden on the total optical power available in the
optical network. This additional burden is sometimes denoted by the term
crosstalk penalty. Consequently, this must be taken into account when optical
networks are being designed and dimensioned, in order to prevent as far as
possible, subsequent undesirable system degradation in implemented
networks. For this purpose, measuring systems are known which incorporate
characteristic elements of the optical network to be designed, and by means of 
which the reception sensitivity and the crosstalk penalty are subsequently
measured. Thus reference [1] describes a measuring arrangement which is
used specifically for measuring the reception sensitivity due to Rayleigh
backscattering in the form of bit error probabilities and the associated
crosstalk penalty in an optical communication system having two signal
sources of CPFSK-modulated signals. This measuring arrangement is based
on an optical circuit containing two 3 dB couplers between which a
monomodal glass fibre of a certain length (typically 1 km) is incorporated, a
first signal source being connected to a connection point of the first coupler,
and the second signal source and the receiving means being connected to two
connection points of the second coupler. The remaining connection points of
the couplers are not used. The connections to the couplers are of such a type
that a signal emanating from the first signal source can arrive at the receiving
means (at least
