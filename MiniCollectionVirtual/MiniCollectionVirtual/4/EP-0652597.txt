<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an insulated gate bipolar transistor which includes a p type 
semiconductor region (11) formed in a surface of an n⁻ semiconductor layer (3) by 

double diffusion in corresponding relation to a p type base region (4) of an IGBT 
cell adjacent thereto, and an emitter electrode (9) formed on and connected to the 

p type semiconductor region (11) through a contact hole (CH
p
) having a width 
(W
ch2
) which is greater than a width (W
ch1
) of a contact hole (CH₁), thereby 
preventing device breakdown due to latch-up by the operation of a parasitic 

thyristor during an ON state and during an ON-state to OFF-state transition even 
if main and control electrodes in an active region are reduced in size.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an insulated gate semiconductor device such 
as an insulated gate bipolar transistor (referred to as an IGBT hereinafter) and a 
method of fabricating the same. An insulated gate semiconductor device comprises a plurality of p type and 
n type semiconductor layers alternately joined together in series such that the 
semiconductor layers at opposite ends are electrically connected to positive and 
negative main electrodes, respectively, and at least one of the other semiconductor 
layers is joined to a gate electrode applying an electric field through an insulator. In general, an IGBT comprises a multiplicity of IGBT elements (referred to 
as IGBT cells hereinafter) connected in parallel. Fig. 32 is a cross sectional view 
showing a basic structure of an IGBT cell forming the IGBT. Referring to Fig. 32, a p⁺ semiconductor layer 1 is formed of a p type 
semiconductor substrate and has first and second major surfaces, and an n⁺ buffer 
layer 2 is formed on the first major surface of the p⁺ semiconductor layer 1. An 
n⁻ semiconductor layer 3 is formed over the n⁺ buffer layer 2. In a partial surface 
region of the n⁻ semiconductor layer 3 is formed p type base regions 4 by selective 
diffusion of p type impurities. Further, n⁺ emitter regions 5 are formed in a partial  
 
region of the p type base regions 4 by selective diffusion of a high concentration 
of n type impurities. Upper surfaces of the p type base regions 4 between the 
surface of the n⁻ semiconductor layer 3 and the surfaces of the n⁺ emitter regions 
5 serve as channel regions 6. A gate insulation film 7 is formed on the channel 
regions 6. A gate electrode 8 made of, for example, polycrystalline silicon is 
formed on the gate insulation film 7. Emitter electrodes 9 made of, for example, aluminum are formed over the 
respective upper surfaces of the p type base regions 4 and the n⁺ emitter regions 5. 
The gate electrode 8 and the emitter electrodes 9 are insulated from each other. 
Gate electrodes 9 for all IGBT cells are electrically connected to each other, and 
emitter electrodes 9 for all IGBT cells are electrically connected to each other. A 
collector electrode 10 made of aluminum or the like is formed on the second major 
surface of the p⁺ semiconductor layer 1. The collector electrode 10 is formed 
integrally for all IGBT cells. In operation, a predetermined collector voltage VCE is initially applied between 
the emitter electrodes 9 and the collector electrode 10. At this time, when a gate 
voltage VGE
