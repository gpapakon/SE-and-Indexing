<ABSTRACT>
A method, apparatus and salt for descaling a strip of metal includes a nozzle assembly mounted within a spray box for spraying descaling product on the strip. The nozzle assembly includes a spray chamber; nozzles mounted directly to the spray chamber; and a heater for heating the chamber, the descaling product in the chamber, and the nozzles by conduction through the chamber. The nozzles are oriented to direct the descaling product in a spray against the upper and lower surfaces of the metal strip for an amount and a time sufficient to descale the metal strip. The nozzle assembly is attached to the spray box and can be easily removed therefrom for inspection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method, 
apparatus and salt for descaling metal strip or sheet by treatment with 
fused alkali salt. Various methods are known for descaling hot metal strip (or 
sheet) in a continuous annealing line of a production facility. One 
method for descaling metal strip is generally referred to as "fused 
alkali treatment", in which the undesired oxide coatings on the 
exterior surfaces, which are formed during the rolling or annealing 
procedures, are removed using fused (or molten) alkali salts for the 
purpose of improving the strip surface either for further processing, 
or as an end product. To complete the descaling, the metal strip is 
further processed, such as for example, by rinsing, quenching, and\or 
immersion for a short period of time in an acid bath (i.e., "acid 
pickling"). The fused alkali treatment can be used to descale a 
variety of alloys of metal strip, such as stainless steel, nickel, 
cobalt and titanium alloys. Various types of apparatus have been proposed in the 
industry for effecting this descaling process. For example, an 
immersion tank is used wherein metal strip is immersed in a bath of 
mixed alkali metal hydroxides or salts. To guide the strip into and 
out of the molten bath, metal rolls typically are used to support the 
metal strip. Using metal rolls, however, can scratch and mar the 
surface of the strip through the presence of insoluble particles on the 
strip and/or the relative movement between the hot strip and the rolls. Additionally, an immersion tank requires a considerable 
amount of space in the processing line of the production facility. 
Further, it has been determined that the descaling salts interact 
rather quickly with the scale on the strip, in fact typically quicker 
than the time it takes the steel to travel through the bath. Hence, 
using an immersion tank to descale a metal strip in a continuous 
annealing line can be inefficient by "overconditioning" the strip with 
excessive salt contact. Overconditioning the surface of the strip can 
make it more difficult to clean the strip in the subsequent acid 
pickling. Methods and apparatus have been developed where descaling 
salts are applied directly to the metal strip in a spray after the 
strip leaves the annealing furnace. Spray systems generally reduce 
overconditioning of the strip and can have a scale loosening, scouring 
or scrubbing action which facilitates oxidizing the scale. For 
example, one technique is shown in Faler, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,126,301 
and
