<ABSTRACT>
An electronic camera (10) connectable to a 
computer (12) is operable either by itself or in 

direct connection with the computer (12) through an 
interface device (14, 16). An imaging stage (12a) 

generates and processes an image signal according 
to capture parameters set from the control section 

(50) on the camera. By interposing a capture 
control stage (68) between the control section (50) 

and a control processor (44) that controls the 
imaging stage (21a), capture parameters may be set 

either from the control section (50) on the camera, 

or from like parameters entered through the 
interface device (14,16) from the computer (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of 
electronic imaging and, more particularly, to a 
portable electronic camera operated as an input device 
to a personal computer. Video cameras and computer frame grabbers are 
well known in the prior art. A typical system employs 
a video motion camera (such as the CCD 4000 RGB Flash-Sync 
Camera manufactured by Eastman Kodak Co., 
Rochester, N.Y.) and a frame grabber board (such as a 
TARGA™ frame store board manufactured by True Vision, 
Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana) attached to the PC bus of 
a personal computer or professional workstation. The 
camera provides the timing to interface with the video 
frame store board by activating the frame acquire line 
of the frame store board whenever an external voltage 
input to the camera is dropped low (e.g., by dropping 
the "Camera Acquire In" line to the CCD 4000 camera). 
While the external voltage input may be separately and 
directly enabled, it is customary when using a video 
camera (such as the CCD 4000 camera) with a personal 
computer to design software to activate the camera's 
frame acquire line from the computer. To capture an 
image into the computer in such a customary 
application, the operator frames the subject while 
observing the live camera output on a video monitor, 
and then interacts with the computer keyboard at the 
proper moment to capture the image. The control of the camera from the computer 
keyboard is a problem in certain situations. For 
instance, a low cost electronic still camera may be  
 
tethered to a small, battery operated notebook or 
penpad personal computer which provides image 
processing, storage, and display of the captured 
images. By relying on the computer to perform these 
tasks, the camera cost can be greatly reduced. In such 
an application, the computer would typically be slung 
over the shoulder or rested on a table, while the user 
holds the camera to compose the image. However, if the 
user must press buttons or pointers on the computer to 
capture each image, as is typical in the frame grabber 
prior art, the system will be very unwieldy to use 
since the user will have to hold the camera in the 
right position with one hand, while operating the 
computer with the other hand. An improved tethered camera is described in 
Serial Number 938,573, "Hand-manipulated Electronic 
Camera Tethered to a Personal Computer", filed August 
31, 1992 (in the name of the present assignee) as a 
continuation of Serial Number 805,220, filed December 
11, 1991. The camera
