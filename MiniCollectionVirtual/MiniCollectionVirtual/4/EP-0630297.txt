<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD AND MECHANISM FOR THE PRODUCTION OF UPWINDING SPIRALWIRE PRODUCTSThe proposed invention refers to a method or mechanism for the formation of spiral wire shape, which upwinds in space forming a solenoid (Fig . 3) , which is characterised by the use of a modif ed, automatic, two-dimensional wire bending machine for the formation of each spiral coil and by the use of holding mechanism for the created solenoid, which mechanism is in coordination with the bending mechanism for the upwinding of the coils and the formation of a solenoid spiral body, where the proposed method has the capability of creating unpwinding spiral shapes with uniform or different shape for each coil (Fig. 3) .STATE-OF-THE-ARTTo the best of our knowledge, there is no awarded patent similar to the proposed method . The two- dimensional wire bending machine which is considered as a pre-requisite for the method, is described in the U.S . Patent Application No . 562, 431 , for which a patent has already been granted . The most common method for production of such shapes is the following:The formation of a plane wire frame is done in the, automatic or not , bending machine by stepwise advancements of the wire for particular lengths Iv and subsequent bending actions at angles φv . This is explained in Fig . 1 (a) , where the wire ( 1 ) , coming from a reel is pulled by the automatic bending machine (3 ) through the pulling/ straightening devices ( 4 ) , (5) and at point O it is bent right (or left ) by the bender (6 ) . The lengths (lv ) are measured from point O on the OX' axis , with left/positive the clockwise direction and left/negative the counter clockwise direction . On the same figure, a plane wire is shown as an example, and it was created as follows : Advancement : l , Bending: ψj , Advancement : I2, 

Bending: q>2r Advancement : lj, Bending: φj. If the advancements ( lv ) and bendings (φv) of the wire are continued , then with the aid of the small inclined plane ( 7 ) [Fig - 1 (b) ] , the created wire form is occupying a second level , above the previous plane form which is seated on the upper surface (8 ) of the bending machine (3 ) . This way, a wire shape can be created which is formed of many levels one on top of each other, having a distance between each other equal to the wire thickness .The most interesting case is the repetition of plane wire shapes, which are simply or doubly symmetric . Some of them are drawn in Fig . 1 (c) . A disadvantage of that . technique is the difficulty of formation of such geometrical
