<ABSTRACT>
In a refillable writing, painting or drawing instrument having a casing (1), a supply compartment (2) for writing liquid containing a capillary reservoir body (3), and having an applicator tip (6) which is attached releasably to the casing (1) and is connected to the reservoir body (3) in the supply compartment (2) via a capillary liquid conductor, for refilling the supply compartment (2) the applicator tip (6) is arranged so as to be removable in a filling opening (5) for writing liquid and an air duct (22) is formed in the supply compartment (2) along the capillary reservoir body (3), which air duct is connected to the filling opening (5) via a connecting channel (21) which opens out laterally into the filling opening (5).

<CLAIMS>
A refillable writing, painting or drawing instrument, 
with a casing (1), a reservoir (2) for writing 

fluid which contains a capillary storage medium (3), and 
with an application tip (6) releasably attached to the 

casing (1) and connected, by means of a capillary fluid 
duct, with the storage medium (3) contained in the reservoir 

(2), 
characterized in that
 the application tip (6) 
is removably arranged in a filler opening (5) for writing 

fluid, and that the reservoir (2) includes an air duct 
(22) extending along the length of the capillary storage 

medium (3) and being connected to the filler opening (5) 
by means of a connecting channel (21) opening laterally 

into the filler opening (5). 
The instrument as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the connecting channel (21) is formed by 
a collar (19) which is coaxial with the filler opening, 

extends into the reservoir (2), is in abutment with the 
storage medium (3) and has its side opposite the air duct 

(22) apertured by an in particular slot-shaped opening 
(20). 
The instrument as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the collar (19) has its edge in engagement 
with the storage medium (3). 
The instrument as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the application 
tip (6) includes a bushing (8) which is attachable inside 

the filler opening (5) of the casing (1) by frictional or 
positive engagement therewith, and which at a section  

 
protruding outwardly from the filler opening has projections 

(16) for the application of a tool (26) acting 
in an axial direction on, or imparting rotation to, the 

bushing (8). 
The instrument as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized 
in that
 the section of the bushing (8) protruding 
outwardly from the filler opening (5) has an annular 

flange (16) of increased diameter which is spaced from 
the filler end of the casing (1) at a relative distance 

suitable for the engagement of the tool (26). 
The instrument as claimed in any one of the 
claims 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the bushing has a 
longitudinal groove on its outside or on its inside. 
The instrument as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 a tool (26) for 
releasing the application tip (6) is attached to a releasable 

component, in particular on a cap (23) for protecting 

the application tip (6). 
The instrument as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized 
in that
 the tool (26) is a fork structure suitable 
for insertion into the space (18) between the annular 

flange (16) and the casing (1).  
 
The instrument as claimed in any one of the 
claims 7 or 8, 
characterized in that
 jaw means (28) for 
protecting the application tip (6) are provided at the 

bottom of the cap (23), the relative distance of said jaw 
means corresponding to the diameter of the filler neck 

(4) of the casing (1), and said jaw means having on their 
sides facing each other parallel rib means (29) suitable 

for insertion in the space (18) between the annular 
flange (16) and the casing (1). 
The instrument as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 it has allocated 
to it a separate tool for releasing the application tip 

(6).
