<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
pressure sensors, and more particularly to the field of 
diaphragm sensors using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) 
technology. The use of pressure sensors or transducers has found 
numerous applications in a variety of fields in which it 
is desirable to monitor fluid flow, liquid level or 
pressure. The electronics industry has attempted to 
accommodate the need for low-cost and dependable sensors 
by utilizing integrated circuit (IC) fabrication 
techniques in the design and manufacture of 
microfabricated diaphragm transducers on IC chips. The 
basic types of silicon pressure transducers include (1) 
piezo-junction devices, (2) piezoresistive sensors, and 
(3) capacitive pressure transducers. Piezoresistive sensors have been formed in 
polycrystalline silicon, laser recrystallized silicon and 
bulk single crystal silicon. The resistors have been 
fabricated by dopant implantation followed by annealing 
and metallization. The diaphragm of the sensor has been 
separately formed by patterning a silicon wafer with an 
oxide insulator, depositing polycrystalline silicon over 
the insulator/wafer surface and removing the oxide from 
between the diaphragm and the wafer. A microfabricated capacitive pressure transducer is 
formed, for example, by diffusing a dopant into a region 
in a silicon wafer that serves as a lower electrode, and 
forming a compliant diaphragm of polysilicon as a second 
electrode that is separated from the diffused region by 
an oxide spacer. The oxide spacer can be removed by  
 
etching through an opening in the backside of the wafer. 
See R.S. Hijab and R.S. Muller, "Micromechanical Thin-Film 
Cavity Structures For Low Pressure and Acoustic 
Transducer Applications," IEEE, CH 2127, 178, September, 
1985. US-A-4,849,070 discloses a method of making multi-layered 
integrated circuit devices having a space between 
closely-spaced layers or between one such layer and a 
substrate; the space is created by subliming away a 
temporary sublimable layer. Similar to US-A-4,849,070, GB-A-2,198,611 
teaches a method of making a device comprising 
a polycrystalline substrate with a polysilicon diaphragm 
layer thereon, and involving deposition of the latter on a 
sacrificial layer which is thereafter removed using an 
etchant. The present invention is as defined in the appended 
claims. A method of forming a microfabricated pressure sensor 
is hereinafter disclosed in which a compliant membrane 
is formed that  
 
encloses a sacrificial insulating
