<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a class of azacyclic
compounds, which are useful as tachykinin antagonists.
More particularly, the compounds of the invention
comprise an azacyclic ring system substituted by an
arylmethyloxy or arylmethylthio moiety.The tachykinins are a group of naturally-occurring
peptides found widely distributed throughout
mammalian tissues, both within the central nervous system
and in the peripheral nervous and circulatory systems.
The structures of three known mammalian tachykinins are
as follows:
Evidence for the usefulness of tachykinin
receptor antagonists in pain, headache, especially
migraine, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis,
attenuation of morphine withdrawal, cardivascular
changes, oedema, such as oedema caused by thermal injury,
chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis, asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity and other
respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitus,
inflammatory diseases of the gut including ulcerative
colitis and Crohn's disease, ocular injury and ocular
inflammatory diseases, proliferative vitreoretinopathy,
irritable bowel syndrome and disorders of bladder
function including cystitis and bladder detruser hyper-reflexia
is reviewed in "Tachykinin Receptors and 
Tachykinin Receptor Antagonists", C.A. Maggi, R.
Patacchini, P. Rovero and A. Giachetti, J. Auton.
Pharmacol. (1993) 13, 23-93. Tachykinin antagonists are
also believed to be useful in allergic conditions
[Hamelet etal Can. J. Pharmacol. Physiol. (1988) 66
1361-7], immunoregulation [Lotz et al Science (1988) 241
1218-21 and Kimball etal, J. Immunol. (1988) 141 (10)
3564-9], and as anticonvulsants [Garant etal., Brain
Research (1986) 382 372-8]. Tachykinin antagonists may
also be useful in the treatment of small cell carcinomas,
in particular small cell lung cancer (SCLC) [Langdon et
al., Cancer Research (1992) 52, 4554-7].It has furthermore been suggested that
tachykinins have utility in the following disorders:
depression, dysthymic disorders, chronic obstructive
airways disease, hypersensitivity disorders such as
poison ivy, vasospastic diseases such as angina and
Reynauld's disease, fibrosing and collagen diseases such
as scleroderma and eosinophillic fascioliasis, reflex
sympathetic dystrophy such as shoulder/hand syndrome,
addiction disorders such as alcoholism, stress related
somatic disorders, neuropathy, neuralgia, disorders
related to immune enhancement or suppression such as
systemic lupus erythmatosis (European patent application
no. 0 436 334), conjuctivitis, vernal
