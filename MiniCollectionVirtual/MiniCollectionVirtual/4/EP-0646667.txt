<ABSTRACT>
The device contains carrier rails (13) for storing the healds and transport means (28, 29, 31) for feeding these to a separating station (ST). Each carrier rail (13) is held by a plurality of controlled clamps (K1 - K6) and is thereby subdivided into a plurality of sections, each for receiving a heald set. The transport of the healds takes place in sets from section to section, the clamp located between the respective sections being opened. The control of the clamps (K1 - K6) takes place by means of sensors assigned to the clamps, at least one sensor being provided for each pair of clamps associated with one another. Use for the storage of healds having closed end loops and of those having open end loops.

Apparatus for the handling of healds for warp-thread 
drawing-in machines, with carrier rails (13) for 

the storage of the healds and with transport means (28, 
29) for feeding them to a separating station (ST), at 

which a separation of the healds for the purpose of 
providing them for the warp-thread draw-in takes place, 

characterized in that each carrier rail (13) is held by 
a plurality of controlled clamps (K
n
) and the transport 
path of the healds on the carrier rails is thereby 

subdivided into a plurality of sections, each for receiving 
a heald set, and in that the transport of the healds 

takes place in sets from section to section, the clamp 
located between the respective sections being opened. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the clamps (K
n
) are controlled in such a way that, 
of two successive clamps, only one can ever be opened. 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the clamps (K
n
) have a clamping gripper consisting 
of two clamping jaws (35, 36), and in that the two 

clamping jaws are actuated in order to open and close the 
clamp. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the two clamping jaws (35, 36) are driven by a 

common drive (33, 37), one clamping jaw being formed by 
a guide (35), fastened to a lifting part (38) connected 

to the said drive, for the carrier rail (13), and the 
other clamping jaw being formed by a pivoting lever (36). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the lifting part (38) is guided in a fixed guide  

 
part (34) and is in engagement with the pivoting lever 

(36), and in that the pivoting lever is mounted on the 
guide part. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that each pair of clamps (K
1
 - K
6
) is 
assigned at least one detector (32) for detecting the 

presence of healds in the region of the clamps. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the detector (32) is arranged on the upper clamp (K
1
 
- K
6
) in each case. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that two detectors (32) are provided at the pair of 

clamps (K
6
) adjacent to the separating station, one at 
the upper clamp and one at the lower. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the detectors (32) have an adjustable sensor lever 

(42), projecting into the path of movement of the healds, 
and a sensor (44) detecting the adjustment of the sensor 

lever (42). 
Apparatus according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the sensor (44) is formed by an inductive sensor. 
Apparatus according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the sensor lever (42) is of two-armed design and is 

positioned in a position of rest, in which one lever end 
(45) projects into the path of movement of the healds and 

the other lever end (46) is located in the effective 
range of the inductive sensor (44). 
Apparatus according to Claim 11, characterized by 
a spring (47) which presses the sensor lever (42) in the 

direction of the position of rest up against a stop (48).
