<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device having a high current driving capability and capable 
of high-speed circuit operation. This device has a first semiconductor region of one conductivity type on a substrate; source 

and drain regions of the opposite conductivity type in the first region; a first insulating film on the substrate between the source 
and drain regions; and a conductive gate electrode on the first insulating film. The first insulating film comprises an insulator 

having a dielectric constant of 8 or more and its film thickness t₁ satisfies the following express (1). The source and drain regions 
are formed in a self-alignment manner with respect to the gate electrode:

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device, and 
in particular relates to a semiconductor device capable of 
high speed operation. At present, a technique for a semiconductor integrated 
circuit has been developed indeed at an amazingly-level of 
high speed. Such surprising grade, amount, and level of 
development is largely owing to fine-element promotion 
planning. The fine-element promotion enables integration of 
more elements within one chip, and as a result, more 
functions per chip can be realized. One more large effect 
by the fine-element promotion is to realize a high speed. A 
current and voltage formula in a saturated region of MOSFET 
is expressed by the following equation (2).

ID = (W/2L) · µC · C0X(VG - VVH)²   (2) 


 
where,

C0X = (ε₀ · εr) / d0X


 
and
 
   W : gate width
 
   L : gate length
 
   µC : channel mobility
 
   C0X : gate oxide film capacitance per unit area
 
 
   VG : gate voltage
 
   VTH : threshold voltage
 
   ε₀ : dielectric constant of vacuum
 
   εr : relative dielectric constant of gate insulating 
film
 
   d0X : film thickness of gate insulating film
 
   Assume that a dimension of the device is scaled down at 
a rate of α times (α < 1). Even when a gate width W and a 
gate length L are reduced at a rate of α times, a drivable 
drain current ID does not vary. However if a thickness D0X 
of a gate insulating film is reduced at a rate of α times, a 
capacitance C0X of the gate insulating film goes at a rate 
of 1/α times, and a drivable drain current ID increases at a 
rate of 1/α. Further, a load capacitance (normally, a gate 
capacitance on next stage) driven by this transistor is 
expressed by C0X·L·W, and lowered at a rate of α. 
Therefore, the required time for charging and discharging 
the load capacitance is sharply reduced at a rate of α² 
times. Thus, improvement of the current driving capability 
and reduction of the load capacitance in respect of elements 
following the fine promotion have achieved the high speed 
operation. However, realization of the fine-promotion policy is 
slowing down recently, where plane dimensions of the gate 
length L and the like reach 0.5 to 0.2 µm that is a 
theoretical limit value of pattern forming by light. For 
the gate insulating film, silicon thermal oxide film SiO₂ is  
 
ordinarily used, but its film thickness comes as thin as 
approximately 5 nm. This designates approximation to the 
limit value of the fine promotion process. For the pattern 
dimension, a dimension therefor equal to or less than 0.1 µm 
is
