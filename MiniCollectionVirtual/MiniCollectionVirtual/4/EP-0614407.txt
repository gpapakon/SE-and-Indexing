<ABSTRACT>
A process of removing flash from a molded silicone intraocular lens (10) includes a step of tumbling the lens body in a tumbling media (24). The tumbling media includes a mixture of .5 mm diameter glass beads and 1.0 mm diameter glass beads, alcohol and water. This process applies to single piece and multipiece silicone IOLs. The flash removal is done in a tumbling container (22) which is rotated in the direction of arrow (26). The process also includes a step of coating the glass beads with an aluminum oxide coating by tumbling the beads in a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and aluminum oxide prior to tumbling of the silicone IOL.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of removing flash from a moulded
silicone lens body.Methods of moulding articles from a mouldable material, such as plastic , have
been practised for quite some time. A common problem associated with moulding
processes is the formation of excess material or flash on the moulded article.
Depending upon the type of article formed in the moulding process and the manner in
which the article is used, the existence of excess material or flash can be undesirable.Prior methods of removing flash from moulded articles include such labour
intensive processes as cutting the flash with a blade or scissors. However, such
cutting methods can be extremely time consuming and expensive, especially when a
large number of articles are being manufactured.Methods of removing flash by tumbling the moulded article in a rotatable
tumbling container have been successfully practised. For example, U.S. Patent No.
2,084,427 to Boderson and U.S. Patent No. 2,387,034 to Milano describe methods of
making plastic articles, buttons in particular, which include steps of tumbling the
articles to remove projections of excess material or flash. Similarly, U.S. Patent No.
4,485,061 to Akhavi et al. describes a method of processing plastic filaments which
includes "abrasive tumbling" to remove excess material.A cold temperature tumbling process is described in U.S. Patent 2,380,653 to
Kopplin. According to this method, flash is removed from a moulded article by
tumbling the article in a rotatable container of dry ice and small objects, such as
wooden pegs. The cold temperature resulting from the dry ice renders the flash
material relatively brittle, such that the flash is more easily broken off of the article
during the tumbling process.U.S. Patent 3,030,746 to Firestine, et al. describes a grinding and polishing
method for optical glass, including glass lenses. The method includes a tumbling 
process wherein the glass articles are placed in a composition of a liquid, and abrasive
and small pellets or media. The liquid is described as being water, glycerine,
kerosine, light mineral oil and other organic liquids either alone or in combination; the
abrasive is described as being garnet, corundum, boron carbide, cortz, aluminium
oxide, emery or silicone carbide; and the media is described as being ceramic cones,
plastic slugs, plastic moulding, powder, limestone, synthetic aluminium oxide chips,
maple shoe pegs, soft steel diagonals, felt, leather, corn cobs, cork or waxes.Another example of a tumbling
