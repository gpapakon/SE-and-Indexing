<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to extracorporeal 
circulatory support, and more particularly to blood 
reservoirs used in extracorporeal circulatory support 
circuits. Extracorporeal support circuits are used to 
provide circulatory support to patients during 
cardiovascular surgery. A support circuit of this type 
includes a venous line for draining blood from the right 
side of the patient's heart. The venous line delivers the 
blood to a blood reservoir, such as the venous reservoir 
sold under the trade designation "SARNS" (Catalog No. 
9445) by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, 
St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A. Blood is typically pumped, 
via a specially designed blood pump, from the outlet of 
the blood reservoir into a blood oxygenator, such as the 
oxygenator and heat exchanger sold under the trade 
designation "SARNS MEMBRANE OXYGENATOR" or "SMO" heat 
exchanger (Part No. 16310) by the Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing Company, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A., for 
oxygenation and cooling. The oxygenated blood is then 
delivered via an arterial line to the patient. While the 
pump is running, the patient returns blood to the venous 
line to repeat the cycle. The support circuit normally also includes a 
blood scavenging sub-circuit for recovering blood from the 
surgical field to recycle the blood. The scavenging 
sub-circuit includes one or more suckers (typically two to 
four) for sucking blood from the surgical field. Vacuum 
is applied to the suckers by a peristaltic positive 
displacement pump (also known as a roller pump) or wall 
vacuum to deliver the scavenged blood to a cardiotomy 
reservoir. A cardiotomy reservoir includes a defoaming 
section because the scavenged blood normally includes a 
large amount of entrained air, and a filter for filtering  
 
the scavenged blood. The outlet for the cardiotomy 
reservoir delivers the de-foamed, filtered blood to the 
venous blood reservoir of the main circuit. U.S. Patent 
Nos. 3,891,416; 3,993,461; 4,208,193; and 4,243,531 show 
various cardiotomy reservoirs. The cardiotomy reservoir may alternatively be an 
integral portion of the venous blood reservoir, in which 
the scavenged blood flows through a filter section and the 
venous blood does not. Both the scavenged blood and 
venous blood would flow through a defoaming section. 
Examples of such combined venous and cardiotomy reservoirs 
are sold under the following trade designations: "SARNS 
MEMBRANE OXYGENATOR WITH INTEGRAL CARDIOTOMY RESERVOIR" or 
"SMO/ICR" (Catalog No. 9462) and "SARNS

including a tube connection (26) on the top (24) of the 

housing (14) for connecting tubing (28) in fluid 
communication with the inlet (18);
 
characterized in that
 
   the downstream end (40) of the inlet tube (38) is positioned at a 

greater elevation in use of the reservoir (10) than the minimum 
specified operating level of fluid;
 
   and a cup or bowl shaped fluid trap (20) is mounted on the inlet tube 

(38) in the chamber (14), the fluid 
trap (20) having a rim (74) surrounding the inlet tube 

(38) at an elevation higher than the downstream end (40) 
of the inlet tube (38) to trap fluid adjacent the 

downstream end (40) of the inlet tube (38).
