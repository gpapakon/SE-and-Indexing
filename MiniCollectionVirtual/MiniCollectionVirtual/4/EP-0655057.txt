<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward cyanoguanidine compounds which are potassium 
channel blockers useful in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders such as congestive heart failure 
and hypertension. The cyanoguanidine compounds of this invention, unlike other cyanoguanidines, 
block potassium channel conduction in vascular smooth muscle and in ATP-sensitive potassium 
channels in apical membranes of the kidney. It is known that K+ channels are important for regulating potassium excretion by the kidney and 
it has been proposed that inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channel conduction in apical cell 
membranes of the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop would reduce potassium recycling across 
the membrane and thus reduce sodium resorption via the Na+-2Cl--K+ co-transporter. It has also 
been proposed that inhibition of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels of apical membranes in principal 
cells of the initial and cortical collecting tubule would reduce K+ secretion, the primary source of 
urinary potassium. K+ channel antagonist activities necessary to produce the observed eukalemic 
natriuresis have been documented in the rat kidney. The subject compounds are effective blockers for the ATP-sensitive potassium channels of the 
thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and the principal cells of the initial and cortical collecting 
tubules of the kidney. This activity results in an enhanced urinary excretion of sodium and water 
without enhanced potassium excretion This provides a useful diuresis which is not complicated 
by an undesirable reduction in plasma potassium levels or hypokalemia. Thus, the subject series of cyanoguanidines, although very closely related to the K+ channel 
agonist pinacidil and related compounds, are potent K+ channel antagonists. U.S. Patent 4,057,636 discloses pyridylguanidine compounds structurally similar to the subject 
compounds except that the subject compounds have a branched methylene linking group to a phenyl 
which can be optionally substituted. Surprisingly, the subject compounds are potassium channel 
blockers whereas the compounds of 4,057,636 are potassium channel openers. Pyridine N-oxide and pinacidil and its related pyridylcyanoguanidines are a class of compounds 
structurally related to the subject invention. Articles disclosing these compounds are as follows: 
Smallwood, JK, J. Card. Pharm., 12:102-9 (1988); and Peterson, HJ, J. Med. Chem., 21(8):773-81 
(1978). Other publications include, JP 166119, published January 2, 1991, discloses cyanoguanidine 
derivatives
