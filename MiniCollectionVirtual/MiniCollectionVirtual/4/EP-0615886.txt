<ABSTRACT>
A supplemental inflatable restraint 
deployment system comprises an energy reserve 

capacitor (78), a first supplemental inflatable 
restraint deployment circuit comprising a controllable 

current source (92) in series with a first squib (98), 
a second supplemental inflatable restraint circuit 

comprising a second controllable current source (96) 
in series with a second deployment squib (100) and a 

control unit (86) for providing a first pulse of first 
duration to the first controllable current source to 

activate the first squib (98) and for providing a 
second pulse of second predetermined duration to the 

second controllable current source to activate the 
second squib, wherein the first and second pulses are 

staggered with respect to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a supplemental 
inflatable restraint system and to a method of 
deploying a supplemental inflatable restraint. The subject of this invention is related to 
our co-pending European patent application 93202723.8. In some existing supplemental inflatable 
restraint systems, one or more electromechanical 
sensors sense sudden deceleration of a vehicle and 
close electrical contacts to initiate desired 
deployment of a supplemental inflatable restraint. 
When the contacts close, current flows through the 
contacts and through the supplemental inflatable 
restraint deployment squib. To ensure rapid 
deployment of the restraint, a high level of current 
flows through the sensors and squib. The high level 
of current often causes arcing of the sensor, which 
may damage the electromechanical sensor and make it 
unsuitable for re-use. In the case of disconnection of the battery 
during an event for which deployment of the 
supplemental inflatable restraint system is desired, 
reserve capacitors are used as temporary energy 
storage devices to supply the energy necessary to 
deploy the supplemental inflatable restraint. 
Typically, several large reserve capacitors are 
provided. For example, a supplemental inflatable 
restraint system may have one reserve capacitor for 
the control unit and one for each squib to be 
activated. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved supplemental inflatable restraint system and 
method of deploying such a system. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a supplemental inflatable 
restraint system as specified in claim 1.  According to another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a method of deploying a 
supplemental inflatable restraint system as specified 
in claim 2. It is possible in some embodiments to 
provide a supplemental inflatable restraint system 
with a reusable electromechanical actuator. It is 
also possible to provide a supplemental inflatable 
restraint system with improved energy management 
enabling both a reduction in the number of capacitors 
necessary and a reduction in the size of the 
capacitors required by the system without a reduction 
in system performance. In preferred embodiments, it is possible to 
control the supplemental inflatable restraint system 
without causing arcing of the electromechanical 
sensor. Preferably, the apparatus controls current 
flow through a deployment squib by use of a switchable 
current source controlled by a control line, removing 
the final
