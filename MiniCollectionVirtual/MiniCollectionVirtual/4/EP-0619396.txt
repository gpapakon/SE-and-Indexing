<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to measuring dispensers 
for washing powders to be placed in the drum of a washing 
machine, with the laundry to be washed. Many devices of this kind are known. So, for instance, from EP-A-0345 409 a device is known 
comprising a closable bag-like element made from an 
open-pore cellular structure, containing the measuring 
dispenser. From WO-A-91 04368 a dispenser reservoir for receiving 
and discharging washing agents is known, comprising a 
filling antechamber which is arranged in front of a washing 
agent receiving space. The said antechamber communicates 
with the washing agent receiving space through openings 
whose cross section may be varied, and is designed as an 
unloading measuring bucket for the dispenser reservoir. From DE-U-91 03 668 a measuring dispenser is known 
comprising a cup-like element to which a cover provided with 
one or more openings is hingedly connected. From EP-A 0253 419 a device is known comprising a body  
 
having at least one movable part enabling it to occupy an 
open position in which the device serves as a means of 
extracting a measured amount of washing powder and a closed 
position in which the device acts as distribution means. From US-A-3 400 808 a dispenser is known comprising two 
separate cup-shaped body members detachably connected at 
their open ends, one of said members being a measuring cup 
having imperforate walls, and the other member having 
perforate walls through which said material may dispense. From GB-A-2 244 722 a dispensing device is known 
comprising a body for holding the washing powder and a lid 
for the body. The lid comprises a mesh like arrangement of 
perforations. However all the said prior art devices have certain 
drawbacks. In the first place, many of these devices are 
cumbersome and have shapes which do not fit easily into the 
packs of washing powder, and particularly into the modern 
packs of concentrated washing powder, which are of very 
reduced sizes also in order to reduce the amount and volume 
of wastes. Furthermore, such devices often have sharp angles that 
can abrade or cut the articles being washed. Moreover, many of said devices are complicated and 
costly.  It is therefore the main object of the present invention 
to overcome to the drawback of the known prior art devices 
by providing a measuring dispenser of flattened and compact 
shape that fits easily into a pack of washing powder and has 
no external sharp edges. This object is achieved by means of a measuring and 
dispensing device
