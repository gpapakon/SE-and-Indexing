<ABSTRACT>
The tape of the present invention has at least one wireshaped, 
high tensile strength separation element embedded into the 

coating resin introduced in line, at the longitudinal section 
between contiguous optical fibre filaments and designed to easy 

the manual split of the tape into tape units each comprising, in 
particular, four fibres without any special tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a separable optical fibre
core tape as set forth in the preamble of claim 1.Small-sized optical cables are nowadays available on the market, comprising inside
them tapes formed by four optical fibres aligned and embedded into a common coating
generally made of acrylate resins, of the same nature as the primary coating of the optical
fibres.Large-sized cables (typically 200-1000 optical fibres) are also available, using ribbons
or modules of 8, 12, 16, ... optical fibres. In particular 8-fibre modules are used, in turn
separable into two 4-fibre modules.The need and utility of the separability is due to the compatibility of the 8-fibre tapes
with the widely-circulated 4-fibre tapes with which they can therefore be promiscuously
handled, fibre-to-fibre jointed through multiple or single melting or through multiple or
single connectors.In order to be able to easily split the tapes into 4-fibre modules on the field without
damaging the optical fibres and without using special tools, several solutions have
been adopted. One of these is based upon a double embedding, i e two 4-fibre modules
are preliminarily assembled and cross-linked and 
subsequently a common coating is applied around the two flanked
modules.Clearly this solution, besides being expensive because of the
double process, entails on increase in size and weight both of
the tape and the cable employing it.Other solutions are based upon the narrowing of the thickness of
the covering resin at the portion of the split line between the
two modules.In one of them, such narrowing is obtained by covering the two
optical fibres adjacent to the split line along a longitudinal
cross-section of the tape with flexible resin having low Young's
module and then embedding the whole into rigid resin having high
Young's modules. In such way, at the split line, the thickness of
the rigid resin coating becomes smaller. However, also this type
of tape has the same drawbacks as the above-mentioned double
process solution.Another solution is based upon the application of a very thin
layer of resin (typically 20 micron thick against 50-80 microns
generally used) with the expedient of adding a release agent at
the line between contiguous optical fibres where the tape is to be
split in order to make the resin softer at the separation line
during split.Also this solution has drawbacks since, besides weakening the
structure of the tape, the introduction of release agents may
give rise to problems, especially in the
