<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an injection system of a propulsion unit intended to allow production of propellant gases from liquid ergols, and comprising a body (10) inside which a cylindrical passage (11) is made, which is closed at one end and emerges into a combustion chamber (12). In order to supply the liquid ergols to the combustion chamber, an injector (13) is pierced with injection channels (31, 32) which can be closed selectively by a closure member (18). According to the invention, the closure member comprises an annular part (20) projecting backwards and defining two coaxial cavities (26, 27) and it is solidly attached to traction means (14, 19) whose alternate displacement provides, by frontal bearing of the closure member on the annular injector (13), simultaneous opening or closing of the channels, the displacement of the injector to a withdrawn position being carried out by a drive end-stop (28) solidly attached to these traction means. Preferably, the injection channels are arranged in a ring of pairs and other channels (33) passing through the injector are arranged between the pairs in order to allow equilibration of the pressures in the region of the internal face of this injector.

Injection system of a propulsion unit intended to 
allow the production of propulsion gas from liquid 

ergols, including a body (10) inside which there is 
formed a cylindrical passage (11) which is closed at one 

end and emerges into a combustion chamber (12), and in 
which there moves an injector (13), the said injector 

being pierced with injection ducts (31,32) for conveying 
the liquid ergols to the said combustion chamber, it also 

being possible for the said ducts to be closed selectively 
by a stopper (18) comprising an annular part (20) 

which projects backwards and delimits two concentric 
cavities (26,27), characterized in that the said stopper 

is integral with traction means (14,19) the reciprocating 
displacement of which, by means of the stopper resting 

frontally on the annular injector (13), ensures the 
simultaneous opening or closure of the said ducts, the 

displacement of the said injector into a recoiled position 
being achieved by a driving stop (28) integral with 

the said traction means. 
Injection system according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the said traction means comprise a double-acting 

piston (14,19) which is displaced between a first 
position of pushing the stopper in which position the 

said cavities are filled with ergols and the said ducts 
are closed off, and a second position of recoiling the 

stopper, in which the said cavities are empty of ergols. 
Injection system according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the said injection ducts are 

organized in a ring of doublets and in that other ducts 

(33) passing through the said injector are arranged  
 

between the doublets so as to allow the pressures at the 
internal face of this injector to be balanced. 
Injection system according to any one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the said stopper includes 

on its anterior face at least one shoulder (38,39) which, 
when the traction means are finished recoiling, enters at 

least one cavity (40,41) made in the closed end of the 
cylindrical passage (11), thus damping the movement of 

the stopper owing to the head loss created in this 
cavity. 
Injection system according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the closed end of the said cylindrical 

passage is formed by two concentric sleeve tubes (22,23) 
between which the rear annular part (20) of the stopper 

slides, the outer surface of the first sleeve tube (22) 
sliding in the passage (11) and the inner surface of the 

second sleeve tube (23) sliding along the stem of the 
traction means (19). 
Injection system according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the annular cavity (21) formed between the 

two sleeve tubes and in which the rear part of the 
stopper (20) slides, is vented to the open air.
