<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that a major reason for the failure to achieve successful in vivo transplantation in large mammalian species has been flaws associated with the design of microcapsules taught in the prior art, flaws in the method of making such microcapsules, and a lack of tests to determine if a given microcapsule will be successful. In accordance with the present invention, a number of functional properties which must be met by a microcapsule in order to achieve successful in vivo transplantation in large animal models have been identified. These properties include (i) a mechanically stable capsule core, (ii) a mechanically strong capsule membrane (i.e., the membrane must be of sufficient strength to prevent capsule disruption), (iii) the absence of excess exposed positively-charged PLL (which leads to fibrosis), and (iv) an adequate level of diffusion of the entrapped biologically active material out of the capsule.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of determining whether the capsules of microencapsulated
cells will be stably functional for a long period. More specifically, the present invention relates
to in vitro methods to test the stability and functionality of capsules in order to estimate their
stability and function in vivo.Diabetes Mellitus is a life-threatening disease
affecting over 100 million people worldwide. Multiple
insulin injections given periodically throughout the day
cannot duplicate the precise feedback of insulin
secretion from the pancreas. A potential method of
treatment is to extract the insulin-producing cells
(islets) from a pancreas and to inject these cells into
the diabetic patient, thus effecting a cure. Microencapsulated islets as a bioartificial
endocrine pancreas were described over a decade ago by Lim
and Sun [Science,210:908-910 (1980)]. By implanting
islets encapsulated in calcium alginate coated with poly-L-lysine
(PLL), they were able to maintain normal blood
sugar levels in diabetic rats for 2-3 weeks. Due to the
very gentle, simple and rapid immobilization procedure,
alginate/polycation entrapment is still the most
promising method for islet encapsulation and an extensive
volume of literature has been devoted to this capsule.
Notwithstanding the substantial body of literature and
experimentation and patent art in this area, to date
there have been no reports of successful long-term
in vivo transplantation of encapsulated islets in large
animal (canine) models by the methods of encapsulation
taught in the literature or in the patent prior art.
Only until viable, long term function is demonstrated in
large animal models can this technology proceed to
application in insulin-dependent diabetic patients.More than a decade has passed since Lim and Sun
described this technology, and successful reversal of
diabetes in large mammalian models by transplantation of
encapsulated islets has eluded all investigators in this
field. As recently as March, 1992, in the Journal of the
American Society for Artificial Internal Organs,
Calafiore reported that intraperitoneal graft of
microencapsulated islet reversed diabetes in mice, but
"this approach was less successful in large diabetic
mammals (canines)" (ASAIO Journal38:36-37 (1992). In
order to overcome this deficiency in prior art capsules,
Calafiore resorted to developing a vascular prosthesis,
comprised of two coaxial tubes, creating a vascular
chamber for encapsulated islets. This required
vascular anastomoses of the device and
