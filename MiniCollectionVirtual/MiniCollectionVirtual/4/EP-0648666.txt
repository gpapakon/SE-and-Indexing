one of recesses in a plurality of grooves (6) provided at 
one end (17) of second fitting body (5) in the lengthwise 

direction, whereby the degree of overlapping between first 
fitting body (2) and second fitting body (5) is adjusted. 

Then, the other end (4) of first fitting body (2) and the 
other end (7) of second fitting body (5) engaging with the 

recesses and protrusions of a fluted portion of sensor 
portion (28) are fixed with a fixing screw (42). Thus, 

the other end (4) of first fitting body (2) and the other

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to fittings
for bicycle, and more specifically, to a fitting for
bicycle for mounting a device for bicycle such as a meter
and a sensor on a component of a bicycle such as a handle
and fork.In recent years, bicycles are sometimes provided with
speed meters so that cyclists can be easily informed of
travel speed, travel distance or the like.Fig. 6 is a side view showing such a speed meter
mounted on a bicycle, Fig. 7 is a view showing encircled
portion "X" in Fig 6 being enlarged, and Fig. 8 is an
enlarged cross sectional view taken along line VIII-VIII
in Fig. 7.Referring to Figs. 6 and 7, a speed meter 30 is
mounted on the stem 31 of the handle of a bicycle 24.
Front spokes 32 of bicycle 24 are provided with a magnet
26, and the portion of fork 34 corresponding to magnet 26
is provided with a sensor portion 28 for generating a
signal every time magnet 26 passes in front of it. The signal generated by sensor portion 28 is input to
speed meter 30 through a cord 11, various operations are
performed based on the signal in the meter, and
information such as speed and travel distance is given to
the user.Now, referring to Fig. 8, how sensor portion 28 is
mounted on fork 34 will be described.A fitting for bicycle 36 for mounting sensor portion
28 on fork 34 includes a band-shaped fitting body 38 which
can be engaged with the grooves and ridges of the fluted
portion of sensor 28 on the outer periphery of one open
end 25, a packing 40 fit along the inner circumference of
fitting body 38, and a fitting screw 42 for fixing one end
25 of fitting body 38 engaged with sensor portion 28 and
the other end 27.Packing 40 is fit along the inner circumference of
band-shaped fitting body 38, then both ends of fitting
body 38 are opened to be fit around fork 34, and packing
40 will be fit along the inner circumference of fitting
body 38 and the outer circumference of fork 34. Sensor
portion 28 and the grooves and ridges of the fluted
portion at one end 25 of fitting body 38 are engaged with
each other, and then the one end 25 and the other end 27
of fitting body 38 and sensor portion 28 are fixed by
fitting screw 42. Fitting body 38 is lightened to forks 
34 through packing 40, and therefore sensor portion 28
will be fixed to fork 34 by means of fitting for bicycle
36.Meanwhile, unlike such fitting for bicycle 36 using
the fitting screw and the packing, there are fittings for
bicycle of cord band type.Fig. 9 is a perspective view showing how a sensor
portion is mounted on a fork with
