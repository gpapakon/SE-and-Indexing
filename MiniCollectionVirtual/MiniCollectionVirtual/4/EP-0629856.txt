Method for the non-radioactive detection of
metabolically labelled DNA in a cell fraction,

wherein

a) the cell fraction is incubated with an antibody
which binds to DNA and this antibody is bound

before or after incubation to a solid phase,
b) the DNA is denatured,
c) a labelled antibody against the metabolic label
is added,
d) the solid and liquid phase are separated and
e) the label of the antibody from step c) is
determined in one of the two phases as a

measure of the metabolically labelled DNA.
Method for the detection of metabolically labelled
DNA by means of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation as

claimed in claim 1, wherein a labelled antibody
against bromodeoxyuridine is used as the labelled

antibody.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 or 2,
wherein the denaturation of the DNA is carried out

by means of microwave treatment or by nuclease
treatment. 
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3,
wherein the antibody which binds to DNA is a

biotinylated for binding to the solid phase and a
solid phase coated with streptavidin is used.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4,
wherein the cell culture supernatant of lysed cells

is added as the cell fraction.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4,
wherein the cytoplasmic fraction of a cell is used

as the cell fraction.
Use of a method as claimed in one of the claims 1
to 4 or 6 for the determination of the effect or

activity of agents causing apoptosis such as
ionizing radiation, chemical compounds such as

dioxins, antibodies or camptothecin as well as of
cytotoxic cells, natural killer cells, macrophages

or LAK cells.
Reagent kit for the detection of metabolically
labelled DNA fragments containing an antibody that

binds to DNA as well as an antibody against the
metabolic label.
Reagent kit as claimed in claim 8, wherein the
antibody against the metabolic label is an anti-bromodeoxyuridine

antibody. 
Reagent kit as claimed in one of the claims 8 or 9,
wherein the antibody that binds to DNA is present

in a biotinylated form for binding to a solid phase
and the kit additionally contains a solid phase

coated with streptavidin.
Reagent kit as claimed in one of the claims 8 to
10, wherein it additionally contains a nuclease for

denaturing antibody-bound DNA.
