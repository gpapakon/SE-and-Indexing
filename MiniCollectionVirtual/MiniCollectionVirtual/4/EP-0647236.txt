<ABSTRACT>
Novel antagonists of endothelin are described, as well as methods for the preparation and pharmaceutical compositions of the same, which are useful in treating elevated levels of endothelin, acute and chronic renal failure, hypertension, myocardial infarction, metabolic, endocrinological, neurological disorders, congestive heart failure, endotoxic shock, subarachnoid hemorrhage, arrhythmias, asthma, preeclampsia, atherosclerotic disorders including Raynaud's disease, restenosis, angina, cancer, pulmonary hypertension, ischemic disease, gastric mucosal damage, hemorrhagic shock, ischemic bowel disease, and diabetes. In the claimed new compounds, the N-terminal 16-His is replaced by a building-block of formula ( alpha ).

<DESCRIPTION>
 ENDOTHELIN ANTAGONISTS IIBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel antagonists of endothelin useful as pharmaceutical agents, to methods for their production, to pharmaceutical compositions which include these compounds and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and to pharmaceutical methods of treatment. More particularly, the novel compounds of the present invention are antagonists of endothelin useful in treating elevated levels of endothelin, acute and chronic renal failure, hypertension, myocardial infarction, metabolic, endocrinological and neurological disorders, congestive heart failure, endotoxic shock, subarachnoid hemorrhage, arrhythmias, asthma, preeclampsia, atherosclerotic disorders including Raynaud's disease, restenosis, angina, cancer, pulmonary hypertension, ischemic disease, gastric mucosal damage, hemorrhagic shock, ischemic bowel disease, and diabetes.Endothelin-1 (ET-1) , a potent vasoconstrictor, is a 21 amino acid bicyclic peptide that was first isolated from cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells. Endothelin-1, is one of a family of structurally similar bicyclic peptides which include; ET-2, ET-3, vasoactive intestinal contractor (VIC), and the sarafotoxins (SRTXs) . The unique bicyclic structure and corresponding arrangement of the disulfide bridges of ET-1, which are the same for the endothelins, VIC, and the sarafotoxins, has led to significant speculation as to the importance of the resulting induced secondary structure to receptor binding and functional activity. ET-1 analogues with incorrect disulfide pairings exhibit at least 100-fold less vasoconstrictor activity. The flexible 

C-terminal hexapeptide of ET-1 has been shown to be important for binding to the ET receptor and functional activity in selected tissues. Additionally, the C-terminal amino acid (Trp-2l) has a critical role in binding and vasoconstrictor activity, since ET[l-20] exhibits approximately 1000-fold less functional activity.Endothelin is involved in many human disease states_ Several in vivo studies with ET antibodies have been reported in disease models. Left coronary artery ligation and reperfusion to induce myocardial infarction in the rat heart, caused a four- to sevenfold increase in endogenous endothelin levels. Administration of ET antibody was reported to reduce the size of the infarction in a dose-dependent manner (Watanabe, T. , et al, "Endothelin in Myocardial Infarction, π Nature (Lond.) 344:114 (1990)). Thus, ET may be involved in the pathogenesis of congestive
