<ABSTRACT>
Menses regulation and, when desired, contraception is achieved at low doses of estrogen and progestin, which otherwise would create episodes of breakthrough bleeding and/or withdrawal amenorrhea, by periodically inducing menses with an antiprogestin.

 ESTROGEN/PROGESTIN/ANTIPROGESTIN METHOD AND KIT FOR ORAL CONTRACEPTION AND REGULATING MENSESBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to a method and kit for achieving oral contraception in gonadal female mammals and regulating menses and/or reducing unscheduled bleed¬ ing in pre-, para- and post-menopausal females with an estrogen, or with estrogen-progestin, in combination antiprogestin. Although inhibition of ovulation in the form.of estrogen/progestin combination oral contraceptives has been the most effective strategy for achieving reversible pharmacological fertility control in women, because of the known adverse side-effects associated with long term contraception by this method, especially in women who smoke in the 40-44 age group, over the years interest in achieving contraception at lower estrogen doses has developed.Thus, during the over 30 year history of combined estrogen/progestin oral contraception, there has been a steady downward adjustment of the daily estrogen dosage, both for oral contraceptive purposes in premenopausal female and for estrogen replacement therapy in post- menopausal females. See, e.g., EP-A-0 253,607, which discloses, as a preferred embodiment, administering to pre-menopausal females daily a tablet containing 1 mg of 17β-estradiol and 0.075 mg of levonorgestrel for 23 or 24 (23-26) days followed by 5 or 4 (2-5) "pill free" or blank-pill days, for a total of 28 days per cycle, and 

the references cited therein, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.Concurrently, although the progestin component has been lowered somewhat also, reduced androgenicity has re- mained an ongoing priority. Together, these adaptations of formulation have been presented in a variety of regi¬ mens, both monophasic and multiphasic. As a result, to¬ day's oral contraceptives are much safer with regard to the incidence and severity of estrogen-linked clotting disorders, as well as the cumulative impact of more"lipid friendly" progestins that maintain high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in circulation.

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of avoiding the bleeding problems associated with administering to a female mammal dosage amounts of an estrogen low enough to create incidents of breakthrough bleeding and withdrawal amenorrhea, which comprises periodic administration to the female of an amount of an antiprogestin effective to reduce or eliminate breakthrough bleeding and, optionally, also induce sloughing of accumulated endometrial tissue whereby menses is induced.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the female mammal is a gonadal human desiring contraception and the estrogen is administered in combination with a progestin in amounts effective to block folliculogenesis and thereby creating a contraceptive state therein and inducing menses upon the administration of the antiprogestin.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the antiprogestin is administered about monthly.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the female is a postmenopausal woman on hormone replacement therapy.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein the estrogen is administered in combination with progestin in an amount effective to suppress endometrial proliferation. 


 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the antiprogestin is administered at longer than monthly intervals.
7. The method of claim 2, wherein the administration of the progestin and estrogen is continued uninterrupted throughout the cycle, including during menses.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the administration of the progestin and estrogen is interrupted proximate the day of antiprogestin administration.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the antiprogestin is administered orally.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the antiprogestin is mitepristone.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the estrogen is ethinyl estradiol.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the progestin is norethindrone acetate.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the female mammal is a gonadal human and the amounts of estrogen and progestin administered are effective to block folliculogenesis and thereby create a contraceptive state therein; wherein the antiprogestin is administered orally; and wherein the administration of the progestin and estrogen is continued uninterrupted throughout out the cycle, including the menses.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein the antiprogestin is administered about monthly. 


 15. The method of claim 12, wherein the antiprogestin is administered at longer than monthly intervals.
16. A kit containing at least about 20 estrogen and progestin-containing tablets, which collectively are effective when 21 thereof are taken on successive days to achieve continuous oral contraception in a gonadal female human being but which contain amounts thereof which are too low to avoid breakthrough bleeding incidents where administration of the tablets is interrupted for a week during each monthly cycle to induce menses; and containing a tablet, arranged in the kit so as to be taken after at least 20 of the estrogen and progestin- containing tablets have been taken, which contains an amount of an antiprogestin effective to induce menses.
17. A kit according to claim 15, containing 28 of the estrogen and progestin containing tablets, arranged to be taken sequentially with the anti-progestin containing tablet positioned as the 20th or later tablet in the sequence.
18. A kit according to claim 15, wherein the estrogen is ethinyl estradiol, the progestin is norethindrone acetate and the antiprogestin is mifepristone.
19. A kit according to claim 15, wherein the estrogen is ethinyl estradiol, the progestin is gestodene and the antiprogestin is onapristone.
20. A pharmaceutical composition in solid oral unit dosage form comprising amounts of an estrogen and of a progestin contraceptively equivalent to 5 meg. to 35 meg. of ethinyl estradiol and 0.5 mg. to 1.5 mg. of norethindiol acetate, respectively, and an amount of an 


antiprogestin effective to induce menses in a female human being who has ingested daily for at least 20 days corresponding amounts of the estrogen and progestin.
21. A pharmaceutical composition according to claim 19, containing 0.5 to 35 meg. ethinyl estradiol, 0.5 to 35 mg norethindrone acetate and 50 to 500 mg. of mifepristone.
22. A pharmaceutical composition according to claim 19, containing 0.5 to 35 meg. ethinyl estradiol, 10 to 15 meg. gestodene and 50 to 500 mg. of onapristone.
