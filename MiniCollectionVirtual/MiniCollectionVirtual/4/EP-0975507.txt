<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an automotive power steering system with hydraulic power assistance, comprising a steering shaft (15) with a steering hand wheel (16) connected to an input member of a steering mechanism (2). An output member of the steering mechanism (2) is connected to wheels (11) of the motor vehicle which are to be steered. Two working chambers (12, 13) of the servo-motor of a booster can be pressurized with hydraulic fluid via the steering valve of a servo-pump (19) when the steering shaft (15) is rotated in relation to the input member. Two sensors (23, 24) are arranged on the steering shaft (15) or on the output member of the steering mechanism (2) to detect an angle of rotation and/or torque. The wheels (11) to be steered and the steering mechanism (2) return to their original position using hydraulic assistance when the steering hand wheel (16) is released following a steering maneuver. The amount and direction of hydraulic power assistance and the resetting of the wheels to be steered (11) are controlled by a common, electrically controlled electromagnetic valve (18).

wheels (11) which are to be steered, after the
steering wheel (16) is released after a steering

process,
characterized in that
 both the magnitude and the
direction of the hydraulic power assistance and the

resetting of the wheels (11) which are to be steered
