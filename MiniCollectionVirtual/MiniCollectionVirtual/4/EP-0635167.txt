<CLAIMS>
A disconnectable male connector for a communications network,
the connector being designed to connect the line wires of a multiline

cable to the lines of the network by plugging the male connector into
a female connector having terminals connected to the lines of the

network, the male connector comprising: a support housing (40) having
a first terminal portion that receives said cable and an opposite

second terminal portion that forms a connection head (80) which is
pluggable into said female connector; connection means (46, 64, 65)

mounted in said support housing, the connection means being connected
to the line wires of said cable and also being accessible on said

connection head to enable them to be put into contact with said
terminals when said head is plugged into the female connector;

immobilizing means (54) for immobilizing said cable in said first
terminal portion of the support housing; and locking means (41)

provided on said connection head for locking it in said female
connector; the male connector being characterized in that said

support housing (40) includes said connection head (80) and a body
(81) which can be assembled together and separated from each other.

and to this end are both provided with securing means (84, 85, 86,
87) including deformable lateral tongues (84, 85) on said connection

head, and lateral bearing surfaces (86, 87) on said body (81).
securing said connection head in place on said body and releasing

them when the cable connected to said network is accidentally pulled.
A connector according to claim 1, characterized in that said
connection head (80) includes at least one cavity (82), and in that

said body (81) includes a peg (83) which enters said cavity (82) to
position said head on said body.
A connector according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
said securing means include on the connection head (80) two lateral

tongues (84. 85) each having an inclined surface (88. 89) near its
end received on said body, and on the body (81) two inclined side

walls (86. 87) on which the respective inclined surfaces of the two
tongues bear when said head is in place on said body. 
A connector according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that said body (81) is made of a metallized

material.
A connector according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that said connection head (80) is made of plastics

material, which may be transparent.
A connector according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that said connection means include first connection

means (65) for connection to said wires (43) of the cable (44) and
second connection means (46, 64) for sliding connection to the

terminals of the female connector, said first and second connection
means being interconnected inside said body (81).
A connector according to claim 6, characterized in that it
further includes a cover assembly (100) containing said cable

immobilizing means (54) and connection means (91) receiving the
individual wires of said cable, the cover assembly being fitted to

said body and locked thereon beyond the connection head secured to
said body in order to close the body while connecting said cable

wires to said first connection means.
A connector according to claim 7, characterized in that the
first connection means include respective forked contacts (65) for

each wire (43) of said cable, each contact being beneath the end of
one of the wires (43) so that when the cover assembly (100) is forced

onto the body (81), each wire end is crimped into the fork of the
corresponding contact.
A connector according to claim 8, characterized in that each
forked contact (65) comprises at least two branches (66) each having

on its inside surface(s) at least one sharp projection (68) adapted

to tear the insulation of the respective wire (43) to establish
contact with the core thereof. 
A connector according to claim 9, characterized in that each
forked contact (65) can receive wires (43) of various gauges.
A connector according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that
said second connection means (46. 64) include a printed circuit (46)

having printed tracks (64) making contact with the respective
terminals of the female connector and to which said fork-shaped

contacts (65) are connected.
A connector according to claim 11, characterized in that said
connection head (80) includes a main cavity (45) receiving said

printed circuit (46), inclined walls (47) on which said printed
circuit received in said main cavity rests, and guide grooves (49)
