<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method of trimming cylindrical cans wherein each 
can is orbited about a central turret axis while being rotated 

about its longitudinal can axis is disclosed. The cans are 
successively mounted with vacuum onto a support mandrel located on 

a support shaft within each of plural cartridge assemblies mounted 
at circumferentially spaced intervals on a turret disk. The can is 

firmly secured to the mandrel by vacuum so that the open end 
portion of the can body projects between an outside. circular 

cutting knife and an inside trimming edge disposed within the open 
end. As the cartridge orbits about the turret axis on the shaft 

axis, the inside trimming edge is radially displaced by camming 
action into contact with the open end portion of the can body and 

the outside cutting edge to generate cutting forces for trimming 
the portion. This trimming occurs as the inside trimming edge is 

maintained radially closer to the turret axis than the can body and 
the outside cutting edge which remain centered on the cartridge 

axis. In the preferred embodiment, however, this trimming can 
occur by gradually camming the entire circumference extent of the 

inside trimming edge into contact with the can body without 
rotating either the trimming edge, outside cutting edge, or can 

body in relation to the cartridge axis. By locating the can 
supporting mandrel on the cartridge shaft, set-up of trim height 

and trim quality is self-contained within the cartridge which 
allows for set-up and quality verification in the tool room before 

the cartridge is placed in a production machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to trimming an annulus 
from an open end of a cylindrical side wall of a can body such that 
the open end terminates in one plane and, more particularly, to the 
use of inner and outer shearing elements and the manner in which 
they coact to generate cutting forces for trimming the can. In plants for manufacturing one-piece beverage containers, a 
trimmer immediately follows a draw and iron press used to form the 
can body. The purpose of the trimmer is to cut off a small portion 
or annulus (e.g., 1/4 inch in axial dimension) of the open end of 
the can body so as to provide a side wall having a uniform height 
and a smooth, uniform edge residing in the same axial plane. The 
scrap produced by the trimmer is in the form of a "trim ring." 
Though simple in principle, the trimming operation is critical, 
since burrs or other irregularities left on the open edge of the 
can body wall will produce defective cans downstream in subsequent 
necking and flanging operations. The complexity of the necking and 
flanging operations makes it difficult to diagnose such problems as 
originating in the trimmer. Consequently, keeping the various 
parts of the trimmer in precise alignment is critical.  All known existing trimmers of which I am aware are similar to 
lathes, in that the bottom of the can is held by external vacuum to 
a base pad, while the open end of the can is trimmed by shearing. 
The shearing may be done against a single sickle knife, or by 
rotating knives within a cartridge. This means that the base pad-must 
be mounted for axial movement to bring the can to a position 
where the knives can trim its open end. Such known apparatus are 
quite complex, and adjustment is difficult and tedious because in 
the lathe-like arrangement the can must bridge the base pad and the 
tooling holding the open end of the can for cutting by the knives, 
whereby these parts of the trimmer are remote from each other in 
terms of how they support the structure of the trimmer. In 
actuality, the "lathe" is typically one of a number of stations in 
a rotating turret. Typically, these turrets rotate about a 
horizontal axis. It is accordingly one object of the present invention to trim 
the open end of the can body without forming burrs or other 
irregularities on the remaining open edge of the can body wall. Another object is to trim the open end while supporting the 
can body on the same structure which supports the trimming 
elements. Yet another object is to provide the trimming
