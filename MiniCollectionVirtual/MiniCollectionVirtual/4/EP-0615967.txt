<ABSTRACT>
A compost bed aerator for aerating composted refuse 
or the like by displacement of the bed comprises two 

milling cylinders (8, 10) rotating in opposite directions 
for peeling off a layer of the side of the bed and 

transferring the material between them onto an elevator 
(22). The material may thereby be delivered in the longitudinal 

axis of the elevator. As the rearmost cylinder 
(10) projects outwards with respect to the foremost (8) 

the capacity is increased significantly, as two layers 
are peeled off simultaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a so-called compost 
bed aerator with a milling cylinder which during displacement 
along a compost bed may peel a layer off it 
and transfer it to an elevator in the shape of an inclined 
conveyor belt. Compost bed aerators are used in connection of the 
composting of comminuted refuse disposed in longitudinal 
beds of a trapeze shaped or triangular cross section. In 
order to promote composting the refuse must from time to 
time be areated which occurs by disposing the bed sideways. 
A compost bed aerator is i.a. known from EP 0 448 
968 A2, comprising a single milling cylinder which 
creates problems in the transfer of the peeled-off 
material for the conveyor belt. The material is flung 
onto one side of the conveyor belt against the side wall 
where it is deposited as a heap. By means of the invention a compost bed aerator of 
the kind indicated in the introduction is provided which 
is particular in that it comprises at least two 
milling cylinders with opposite directions of rotation 
whereby the loosened material may be delivered to the 
centre of the belt conveyor. The material which is 
peeled off by the front cylinder is caught by the the 
rear cylinder so that an even flow of material is 
created between the two cylinders. By letting the rear 
cylinder project with respect to the front cylinder the 
capacity is increased because two layers are peeled off 
the bed simultaneously. Similarly the front cylinder 
may have a smaller diameter than the rear cylinder. A 
similar result will be obtained if the rear cylinder is 
provided with milling elements which are longer than 
those of the front cylinder. The projecting milling elements or scrapers are 
advantageously disposed on one or more helices and in 
such a manner that they are oriented in such a way on 
the lower part of the cylinders that they throw the  
 
peeled-off material upwards onto the conveyor belt while 
they are oriented oppositely on the upper part of the 
cylinders in order that they send the material down and 
onto the belt conveyor. In order to restrain the peeled--off 
material further on the conveyor belt a cover is 
disposed in connection with the side walls of the elevator 
which runs from the milling cylinders across the 
elevator and at an angle towards the conveyor belt. In order to maximize the peeling-off from the bed 
the milling cylinders may be inclined according to the 
side of the compost bed, i.e. they may be continuously 
be adjusted according to the slope of the side of the 
be

<CLAIMS>
A compost bed aerator with a milling cylinder 
which during displacement along a compost bed may peel a 

layer off it and transfer it to an elevator (22) in the 
shape of an inclined conveyor belt, characterized 

in that it comprises at least two milling cylinders 
(8, 10) rotating in opposite directions. 
An aerator according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the rearmost milling cylinder (8) 

as seen in the direction of travel projects outwards 
with respect to the foremost cylinder (10). 
An aerator according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the rearmost milling cylinder 

has a larger diameter than the foremost cylinder (10). 
An aerator according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the milling elements of the 

milling cylinders are constituted by a number of projecting 
scrapers (32) disposed on one or more, preferably 

three helices (34). 
An aerator according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the scrapers of the lower parts 

of the milling cylinders are disposed such that they 
carry the peeled-off material up onto the conveyor (22) 

while the scrapers of the upper parts are disposed such 
that they carry the peeled-off material down to the 

conveyor. 
An aerator according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the milling cylinders may be 

angled sideways about a horizontal axis (14) in the 
longitudinal direction in order to adapt to the sides of 

 
the compost bed. 
An aerator according to claim 6, characterized 
in that the milling cylinders are mounted 

in a frame (12) which is pivotally supported on a horizontal 
axis (14) at the lower end of the chassis and in 

which the angular position with respect to the compost 
bed is controlled by hydraulic cylinders (15) or similar 

means. 
An aerator according to claim 1, 4, or 5 
characterized in that a cover (30) is fitted 

from the top of the milling cylinders across and facing 
the conveyor which conducts the material flow from the 

cylinders towards the conveyor belt. 
An aerator according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the elevator (22) is divided into 

at least two sections (64, 66), in which the outermost 
sections (66) may be swivelled or displaced to fit inside 

the outer contours of the machine. 
An aerator according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the milling cylinders are raised 

or lowered by angling a drawbar (6) linked to the 
machine by means of a hydraulic cylinder while the drive 

wheels (4) may be raised or lowered.
