<CLAIMS>
Stucco mortar with high thermal insulation capacity, in particular as dry 
mortar, for machine conveying and/or plastering on the basis of foam glass 

granulate, 
characterized by
 the following composition of basic materials in 
percent by weight related to their total dry weight: 


25 to 55 % by weight foam glass granulate, 
10 to 25 % by weight lime hydrate, 
15 to 50 % by weight hydraulically hardening binding agents, 
 
plus further mineral additives and chemical additives for obtaining the desired 

working properties and workability, for plasticizing, for setting the 
water retention value, for the assurance of thixotropy and/or water repellent 

finishing.
