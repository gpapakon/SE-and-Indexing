Shifting device for gearshift operation of multistage 
gearboxes for motor vehicles, 


with an electric motor (1) for generating the shifting 
force/movement of a shift rocker (12) of the gearbox, 
with a push rod (5), 
with a spatial cam mechanism (4) connected to the 
electric motor (1) so as to be substantially axially 

aligned 
and with a shifting element which comes into operation 
between the cam mechanism (4) and the shift rocker (12), 
 
characterised in that 


with a view to shifting all of several shift rockers (12) 
only one electric motor (1) in conjunction with only one 

cam mechanism (4) and only one shifting element or only 
one push rod (5) are provided and 
the shifting element consists of the push rod (5) which 
is capable of being displaced substantially parallel to 

the wheel axle and several coupling mechanisms (11) which 
are each assigned to the shift rockers (12) and which are 

capable of being operated individually with a view to 
gear selection and which in the actuated state each 

establish a drive connection between the push rod (5) and 
one of the shift rockers (12). 
Shifting device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the spatial cam mechanism (4) is a threaded spindle 

(6) with a threaded nut (7) running thereon. 
Shifting device according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that the cam mechanism (4) is connected via one of its two 

parts (6, 7) to the push rod (5) in such a way as to prevent 
rotation or displacement. 
Shifting device according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the threaded spindle (6) is connected to the push rod 

(5) so as to constitute a substantially integral component, 
whereas the threaded nut (7) is connected to the motor shaft  

 
(3) in such a way as to prevent rotation or axial 

displacement. 
Shifting device according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that two coupling devices operating in substantially 

opposing manner are assigned to the threaded spindle (6), by 
means of which coupling devices 


with a view to generating the shifting force/movement the 
unit (6, 5) constituted by the threaded spindle and push rod 

is capable of being connected to the casing (2) in such a way 
as to be incapable of rotation but capable of axial 

displacement, and 
with a view to gear selection the threaded spindle / push 
rod (6, 5) is capable of being connected to the threaded nut / 

motor shaft (7, 3) in such a way as to prevent rotation but to 
be incapable of axial displacement. 
Shifting device according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the push rod (5) is fixed to the threaded nut (7) 

which is connected to the casing (2) in such a way as to be 
capable of axial displacement and at the same time incapable 

of rotation, whereas the threaded spindle (6) is fixed to the 
motor shaft (3). 
Shifting device according to Claim 4 or 6, 
characterised in that with a view to implementing the gear 

selection several individually operable coupling mechanisms 
(11) each interacting with a shift rocker are assigned to the 

one push rod (5), whereby said coupling mechanisms attach the 
shift rockers (12) individually to the push rod (5) or to the 

gearbox casing (2). 
Shifting device according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the coupling mechanisms (11) are designed to act 

perpendicularly to the shifting movement of the push rod (5) 
and are activated via fixing devices (13) including 

electrical, electromagnetic, pneumatic or hydraulic devices.  
 
Shifting device according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the coupling mechanisms (11) are mechanisms which in 

each case are capable of being operated by rotation of the 
unit (5, 6) constituted by the push rod and threaded spindle 

and which, depending on the angle of rotation of the push rod 
(5), attach one of the shift rockers (12) to the rod. 
Shifting device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that in each case at least one electronic control device 

(14) for controlling the shifting movement, the shifting force 
and the gear selection is assigned to the electric motor (1).
