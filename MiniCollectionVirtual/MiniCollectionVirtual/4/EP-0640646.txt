<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of a stabilized polycarbonate. More
specifically, this invention relates to a process for
the production of a stabilized polycarbonate excellent
in melt stability, melt moldability, resistance to
hydrolysis and hue.Polycarbonates are excellent in mechanical
properties such as impact strength, etc. and in
transparency, and find application in various fields.
As a process for producing polycarbonates, there have
been known an interfacial process in which a dihydroxy
compound and phosgene are directly reacted and a
melting process in which a dihydroxy compound and a
carbonic acid diester are subjected to an ester
interchange reaction under reduced pressure with
heating.The latter melting process is preferable to
the former interfacial process because a polycarbonate
resin can be produced advantageously at low cost and
without using a solvent such as methylene chloride or
the like which is desirable from the environmental
aspect.In a conventional process for producing a
polycarbonate by melting, an alkali metal compound or
an alkaline earth metal compound is usually used as a
catalyst component. A polycarbonate resin obtained by
using such a catalyst, however, involves problems that
it lacks a melt stability due to the remaining
catalyst, and that in melt-molding, part of the
polycarbonate resin is sometimes thermally decomposed,
its molecular weight is decreased, its transparency is
decreased, the polycarbonate resin is colored, and so 
forth.Japanese Patent Publication No. 44,303/1979
discloses a method for stabilizing a polycarbonate
resin in which methyl benzenesulfonate or a compound
represented by the formula

   wherein R1 is a C1-12 alkyl group, and R2 is
a C1-6 alkyl group,
to a polycarbonate resin. The polycarbonate resin
obtained by this method, however, tends to yellow in
melt-molding and is still insufficient in resistance to
hydrolysis. Accordingly, it is demanded to develop a
polymerization catalyst and additives or a
polymerization technique to solve such problems.Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No.
171,024/1993 (Kokai Sho 64-13267) discloses a
polycarbonate resin composition comprising 100 parts by
weight of a polycarbonate resin, 0.1 to 20 parts by
weight of a sulfonic acid phosphonium salt represented
by the formula

   wherein R1 is a C1-40 alkyl group or an aryl
group, and each of R2 to R5 is independently
H, a C1-10 alkyl group or an aryl group,
and 0.01 to 3.0 parts by weight of a sulfur-containing
ester compound.Japanese
