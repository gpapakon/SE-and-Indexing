<ABSTRACT>
A process and system for sterilizing packages of thermally-treatable 
products having different sterilization processing requirements. 

These packaged products can be different types of canned 
soups, for example. At least one of the packaged products is preheated 

a significant, predetermined amount in a preheat vessel in a 
steam or steam-air mixture to accommodate these different processing 

requirements. This allows the first and second packages to be 
processed through the stationary hydrostatic sterilizer, which is generally 

separate from the preheat vessel, at a common line speed and 
temperature. Expensive sterilizer changeover delays are thereby 

reduced significantly or even avoided. This process also allows the 
soup to be cold blended, reducing the likelihood of any overcooking in 

the large cooking kettle and reducing the amount of starch needed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
thermally processing canned food products. Conventional methods of preserving canned foods after the 
cans have been filled and closed require that they be subjected to heat 
treatment for a given period of time. This commercial process provides 
a sterile product with excellent keeping qualities, and the product 
can also have nutritive value and organoleptic (color, taste and 
aroma) properties which are equivalent to or even better than those 
of home canned products. To reduce the amount of labor required in the process and to 
properly control the sterilization process, many canneries have 
installed continuous sterilizers, such as those made by FMC. These 
tall, continuous, high capacity sterilizing cookers have been built in 
recent years since the thinking was that faster, bigger and continuous 
were better. Another example is the "Hydromatic" sterilizer, which 
is an automatic continuous sterilizer available from Stork. It typically 
includes a first heat-up tower, followed by a pair of sterilizing towers, 
a cooling leg tower, a pair of spray-cooling towers, and a drying section 
tower to prevent recontamination. The cans are fed into the 
towers by an automatic feed and are carried through the system by a 
can holder chain arrangement and fed out of the system by an automatic 
discharge. This sterilizer can handle vegetables, meats, baby 
foods, corn, fruits, soups, milk, cream, milk drinks, and evaporated 
milks in almost any shape of today's cans. Heavy insulation and all-weather aluminum coverings allow the 
Hydromatic to be placed outdoors. A centralized drive can be positioned 
on the top of the cooker, such as above the final drying leg  
 
tower, and the shafts and wheels thereof allow the chain to reverse 
its direction of travel. The chains are constructed to be sturdy and to 
resist the risk of breakage through corrosion from the system's steam 
and water. The carriers are open, acting as bucket elevators, and 
thus the cans can be fed in along any point of the full length or height 
of the preheating tower and discharged at any point between the top 
and the bottom of the last cooling tower. Thus, one or even several 
feeder lines can be connected to the cooker at any height. Special 
carriers can be used to handle cans of unusual shapes or sizes. The sterilizer uses the hydrostatic principal wherein steam 
pressure in the sterilizing section is balanced by water columns on 
either side thereof. The height of the columns depends on

<CLAIMS>
A food product preparation process, said process comprising the steps of: 
blending a food product in a large kettle at a temperature less than 54.4°C 

(130°F); 
   filling the blended food product from the large kettle into a plurality of 

containers and sealing the filled containers; 
   preheating the sealed containers and their food products in a preheat vessel; 

and 
   passing the preheated containers through a hydrostatic sterilizer and thereby 

sterilizing the food products therein. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the temperature of said blending step is 
between 21.1°C and 26.7°C (70 and 80°F). 
The process of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said filling step is for a period of 
approximately thirty minutes. 
The process of any one of the preceding claims wherein said passing step is 
at 121.1°C (250°F) and for fifty to fifty-five minutes. 
The process of any one of the preceding claims further comprising, before 
said passing step, conveying the preheated containers from the preheat vessel to 

the hydrostatic sterilizer. 
The process of any one of the preceding claims wherein said food product 
is a soup. 
The process of claim 6 wherein said soup includes a starch to prevent 
settling of the components thereof in the large kettle during said filling step. 
The process of any one of the preceding claims wherein said preheating 
preheats the food product to approximately 21.1°C (70°F).
