<ABSTRACT>
Device for arranging a set of substantially identical flat objects K, especially video-tape cassettes, of the type consisting of a peripheral wall (2, 4, 6, 9) surrounding the lateral faces of the said set and of a rear end (1) against which rest the front faces of the said objects, opposite a window for their setting in place and their extraction, characterised in that, with a view to facilitating the said extraction of any one of the said objects from the said set, especially when these objects are held tightly against one another, the said rear end (1) includes, in a region approximately mid-way up the said front faces, a horizontal relief element (12) perpendicular to the plane of the said front faces, this element constituting a pin for rocking the said objects, a pressure exerted on a portion situated beneath the level of the said pin of the rear face of one of the said objects having the effect, by rocking the said object about the said pin, of pushing in the portion of the said rear face on which this pressure is exerted, this simultaneously partially disengaging the corresponding lateral faces of the still stationary adjoining object, this allowing grasping and extraction by simple forwards translation.
