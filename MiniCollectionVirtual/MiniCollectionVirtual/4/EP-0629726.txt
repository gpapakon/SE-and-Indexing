<ABSTRACT>
To prevent weaving faults, according to the process, on the one hand the weaving machine is stopped as a function of a disturbance signal and on the other hand the fabric edge (15) is simultaneously shifted into a set-aside position (15'), so that the reed does not butt against the incorrectly inserted weft thread. Run-on points in the fabric are prevented by means of a starting process coordinated with the type of fabric, of the warp thread and of the weft thread.
