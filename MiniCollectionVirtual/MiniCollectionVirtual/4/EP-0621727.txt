<ABSTRACT>
In an image transformation apparatus for performing image 
transformation process to a video signal, a sequential read address is 

transformed based on the function of which a first differential 
coefficient reduces monotonously in a manner approaching "0" from "1", 

and then the video signal is read out from a storing means by this 
transformed read address, so as to add an image collapsing effect to 

the video signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image transformation apparatus, and more
particularly, to a video special effect generating process for rendering a special effect
for example to a video signal.GB-A-2 200 266 discloses an image transformation apparatus for performing
image transformation process to video signal, comprising: a storing means for storing
an input video signal; a read address generating means for generating a sequential
read address; and a transformation means for transforming said read address, based
on a function, the read address transformed by said transformation means being
supplied to said storing means as a read address signal, thereby a desired effect is
rendered to said video signal.Heretofore, an image transformation apparatus is disclosed, for example, in
the U.S. Patent No. 5070465. In this type of image transformation apparatus, input
video signal is sequentially written to a predetermined region of a frame memory on
the basis of write address output from a write address generation circuit and data in
the frame memory is read out by read address which is input from a read address
generation circuit, thereby various special effects are rendered to the video signal so
as to display an image in a transformed manner.
None of such image transformation apparatus of the read address controlling type has
been adapted to provide a special effect by which a lower portion of a picture frame,
for example, collapses as if a pile of sand does.In view of the foregoing, an object of this invention is to provide an image
transformation apparatus in which it is possible to provide a special effect to input
video signal, for example a special effect whereby a portion of the image collapses
as if a pile of sand trickles.According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided apparatus for
transforming an image represented by a video signal, comprising a store for storing
the image, as represented by the video signal, at addresses represented by orthogonal
co-ordinates x, y; a read address generator for generating read addresses x, y
sequentially, and read address transformation means arranged to transform the read
addresses x, y into transformed read addresses X, Y which are supplied to the store
to read out the image characterised in that
X = x;Y = F(y+G(x)) - G(x);G(x) is a predetermined function of x; andF(y+G(x)) is a function which has a first differential coefficient the value of
which is unity over a first predetermined range of values y+G(x) and the value of
which reduces progressively in
