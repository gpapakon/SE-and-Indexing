<DESCRIPTION>
POLYESTER BASED POLYMER BLENDS USEFUL FOR FORMING EXTRUSION BLOW MOULDED ARTIC LES.Technical Field This invention relates to polymer blends useful for forming extrusion blow molded articles, which blends contain a high molecular weight polyethylene terephthalate (PET) , a lower molecular weight recycled scrap polyethylene terephthalate, and a small amount of polycarbonate.Background of the InventionComposition of matter patents relating to polycarbonate and poly(ethylene terephthalate) alloys include U.S. 3,218,372. The alloys described in this patent contain 5 to 95 wt % polycarbonate blended with 95 to 5 wt % poly(ethylene terephthalate) . Other patents pertaining to polycarbonate and poly(ethylene terephthalate) alloys include U.S. 4,123,473, U.S. 4,175,147, U.S. 4,230,656 and U.S. 4,788,251.However, none of these disclose an extrusion blow molded container produced from a high molecular weight poly(ethylene terephthalate) having a weight—average molecular weight of between 75,000 and 85,000 blended with 4 to 40 wt % recycled scrap poly(ethylene terephthalate) having a weight—average molecular weight of between 40,000 and 55,000 and 1.0 wt % to 10.0 wt % polycarbonate or a polycarbonate/poly(ethylene terephthalate) concentrate as a melt strength enhancer. Recent development work has shown that high molecular weight (weight—average molecular weight of 75,000 to 85,000) poly(ethylene terephthalate) modified with small amounts of 1,4—cyclohexanedimethanol has sufficient melt strength for extrusion blow molding on conventional extrusion blow molding machines into 

containers in sizes up to about 2 liters. It would be helpful for extrusion blow mold operators to be able to use up to about 25 wt % recycled PET such as scrap from PET bottles (weight-average molecular weight between about 40,000 and about 55,000), combined with neat PET when producing these containers. However, when 25 wt % to 50 wt % recycled material is combined with neat PET during the extrusion blow molding process, the melt strength is reduced significantly which makes it very difficult to hang (extrude vertically) parisons for producing containers.It has been discovered that the melt strength of high molecular weight poly(ethylene terephthalate) containing 25 wt % to 50 wt % recycled scrap PET can be increased by adding a small amount of a neat polycarbonate or a mixture of 75 to 90 wt % polycarbonate with 25 to 10 wt % PET or poly(ethylene— co—3,5-1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) alloy. This discovery will allow extrusion
