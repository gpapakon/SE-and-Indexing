<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to plant parts suitable to be used as tobacco substitute in smoking compositions and in smoking substitutes, which at least partially originate from Alchemilla vulgaris and/or Myrtus communis. The invention particularly relates to mixtures containing 60-99.9 % by weight of Alchemilla vulgaris or Myrtus communis. In addition, the mixture may consist for maximum 50 per cent by weight of one or more types of aromatic plants which are preferably selected from the group Asperula odorata, Mentha piperita, Salvia officinalis, Thymus vulgaris and Eucalyptus globulus, and/or extracts thereof and/or synthetic equivalent aromatic substances and/or flavourings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
the use of plant parts as tobacco substitute in smoking 
compositions and in smoking substitutes, and to smoking 
compositions produced with such tobacco substitutes. The smoking of tobacco and of products based on tobacco is 
an old habit, of which the risks and damages become more 
and more public. At the moment it is generally believed 
that the smoking of tobacco and tobacco compositions is 
harmful to your health. In a number of countries it is 
therefore even required to place a warning on such 
products. Further it is not recommended to smoke tobacco 
and tobacco compositions, or not even allowed by the 
doctor attending the patient, with various disorders. 
Moreover, the regularly smoking of tobacco leads to a more 
or less great affection or even addiction, which on the 
one hand is caused by the nicotine in the tobacco, and on 
the other hand by the recalled primary sucking reflex 
which gives a secure feeling. Consequently, when quitting 
the smoking of tobacco, the withdrawal symptoms are both 
of a physical and psycological nature. However, it seems 
to be more difficult to endure the psychological 
withdrawal than the loss of nicotine, since the dependency 
on nicotine usually no longer exists after an average 
habit period of ten days.  
 Therefore it seems logical to substitute tobacco by 
nicotine-free tobacco substitutes. Certain plants, 
preferably dried and shredded in an appropriate manner, 
are known as tobacco substitutes. Examples thereof are 
described in the collection "Les Plantes Fumables" (1978) 
by Alain Saury, published by Maloine S.A., Paris. CA-A-1184756 discloses a tobacco substitute consisting 
of a mixture of a plurality of specific dried plant parts, 
namely dried angelica leaves, dried dittany leaves, dried 
licorice leaves and ten further species.  
 A disadvantage of the existing tobacco substitutes based 
on plants, is that the thus proposed substitutes generally 
give an unpleasant taste or an unpleasant aroma or often 
both. Furthermore, they were not experienced as actual 
substitutes of tobacco, so that the consumers fell back on 
the smoking of tobacco compositions after a shorter or 
longer period. Even in the above-mentioned collection "Les 
Plantes Fumables" quite a number of examples of 
compositions still contains a percentage of tobacco. The present invention relates to the use of certain 
plants, viz. mixtures containing Alchemilla vulgaris and 
Myrtus communis as tobacco substitutes, particulary in 
smoking
