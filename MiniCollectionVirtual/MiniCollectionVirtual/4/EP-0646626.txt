<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to polymer mixtures comprisigng an aromatic 
polycarbonate, a graft copolymer and carbon fibres. Polymer mixtures which 

comprise an aromatic polycarbonate and a graft copolymer having a rubber substrate 
have a good impact strength. By adding such graft copolymers to aromatic 

polycarbonates, these do no longer satisfy the glow wire test". The composition 
according to the invention satisfies the glow wire test and has a good impact strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a polymer mixture which comprises the 
following constituents: 
A. an aromatic polycarbonate resin; and B. 3-12% by weight of a graft copolymer obtained by 
grafting one or more monomers on a rubber substrate 
with a glass transition temperature of less than 0째C; and C. 0.1-1.0% by weight of carbon fibres, 
the quantities by weight being calculated with respect to the sum of the 
uantities by weight of the constituents A, B and C. The invention also relates to the use of carbon fibres to vary the 
properties of a polymer mixture which comprises an aromatic polycarbonate resin and 
a graft copolymer in such a manner that the polymer mixture has better properties 
with regard to the glow wire test. Aromatic polycarbonate resins are generally known. They have 
numerous good properties among which a good impact strength. It is known to 
improve the properties of aromatic polycarbonate resins by mixing these with graft 
copolymers obtained by grafting one or more monomers on a rubber substrate with a 
glass transition temperature of less than 0째C. The addition of such graft copolymers 
quite unexpectedly involved that the aromatic polycarbonate behaves much more 
favourably in the glow wire test, as a result of which the mixture of the aromatic 
polycarbonate with the graft copolymer is no longer suitable for certain uses in the 
electroindustry. The invention is based on the discovery that the addition of carbon 
fibres to the above-mentioned mixtures of aromatic polycarbonate resins and graft 
copolymers improves the behaviour in the filament test.  The polymer mixture according to the invention comprises at any rate 
the following constituents: 
A. an aromatic polycarbonate resin; B. a graft copolymer as defined hereinbefore, and C. carbon fibres, in the quantities stated hereinbefore. The polymer mixture according to the invention may moreover 
comprise other polymers and conventionally used additives. Aromatic polycarbonates are materials known per se.
 
They are generally prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol compound with a 
carbonate precursor, for example, phosgene, a halogen formiate or a carbonate ester. 
Aromatic polycarbonates are polymers which comprise units of formula V 
wherein A3 is a bivalent aromatic radical derived from the dihydric phenol used in 
the preparation of the polymer. As dihydric phenols may be used in the preparation of 
the aromatic polycarbonates: mononuclear or polynuclear aromatic compounds which 
comprise two hydroxy radicals each directly
