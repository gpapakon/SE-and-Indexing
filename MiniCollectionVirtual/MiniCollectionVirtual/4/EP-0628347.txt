<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new process for presulphurising a catalyst for converting hydrocarbons. The presulphurising of the catalyst is preferably carried out ex situ. The process for presulphurising the catalyst is characterised by the use of a presulphurising agent containing (a) at least one first sulphur compound with a decomposition point T1 lower than approximately 220@C and (b) at least one second sulphur compound with a decomposition point T2 higher than approximately 220@C.

A presulphuration process for a hydrocarbon
conversion catalyst, characterised in that a

presulphuration agent is used containing (a) at
least one first sulphur compound with a

decomposition point T1 of Less than 220°C and
(b) at least one second sulphur compound with a

decomposition point T2 greater than 220°C.
Process according to claim 1 wherein said first
sulphur compound contains at least one -S-S- or

-S-C- structure.
Process according to claim 1 wherein said second
sulphur compound has a structure comprising at least

one sulphur atom bonded to at least one oxygen atom.
Process according to claim 1 wherein said first
sulphur compound contains at least one -S-S- or

-S-C- structure and said second sulphur compound has
a structure comprising at least one sulphur atom

bonded to at least one oxygen atom. 
Process according to claim 4 wherein said first sulphur compound is
selected from the group constituted by organic polysulphides,

elemental sulphur, a combination of sulphur and vegetable oil, or
resulting from a vegetable oil, and a combination of sulphur and an

olefin wherein said second sulphur compound is selected from the
group constituted by sulphones such as alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl and

arylalkyl sulphones or sulphoxides, sulphonic acids and their
derivatives, sulphates, sulphites, sulpholanes and derivatives thereof.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the second
sulphur compound is dimethylsulphone or sulpholane.
Process according to claim 5 or 6 wherein the catalyst contains at
least one metal selected from the group constituted by chromium,

molybdenum, nickel, cobalt and tungsten.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein the catalyst
comprises a cobalt-molybdenum, nickel-molybdenum or nickel-tungsten

pair.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 8 wherein the weight
ratio between the amount of sulphur produced from the first sulphur

compound and that from the second sulphur compound is between
100 and 0.5, preferably between 50 and 1.
Process according to any one of claims1 to 9 as applied to offsite
presulphuration of catalyst.
