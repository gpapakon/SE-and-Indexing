The use of a copolymer comprising

75 - 95% by weight of the total amount of monomer of
at least one vinyl monomer which is free from

carboxyl and amide groups,

5 - 20% by weight of at least one carboxylic acid
amide of the formula (I)



in which

R
is a hydrogen atom or a methylol radical,
R
1
is a hydrogen atom or a C
1
-C
3
-alkyl radical and
R
2
is a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical,

and if appropriate together with not more than 5% by
weight of a copolymerizable unsaturated carboxylic

acid, as a detergent additive for preventing
reabsorption of detached dyestuffs and dyestuff

degradation products.
The use as claimed in claim 1 of a copolymer
comprising

85 - 90% by weight of the total amount of monomer of
at least one vinyl monomer which is free from

carboxyl and amide groups,

7 - 14% by weight of at least one carboxylic acid
amide of the formula (I) and

0.1 - 3.0% by weight of a copolymerizable, 
unsaturated carboxylic acid.
The use as claimed in claim 1 of a copolymer,
wherein the copolymer comprises, as the vinyl

monomer, olefins, preferably ethylene, propylene
and/or isobutylene, vinyl ethers, preferably vinyl

methyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether and/or vinyl n-butyl
ether, vinyl esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids

having 2 to 18, preferably 2 to 10, carbon atoms
and/or (meth)acrylic acid esters of C
2
-C
9
-alkanols.
The use as claimed in claim 1 of a copolymer,
wherein the copolymer comprises at least two vinyl

monomers which are free from carboxyl and amide
groups, the content of the vinyl ester being at

least 50% by weight of the total amount of the vinyl
monomers.
The use as claimed in claim 4 of a copolymer,
wherein the content of the vinyl ester is 75 to 95%

by weight of the vinyl monomers.
The use as claimed in claim 1 of a copolymer,
wherein the copolymer comprises, as the

copolymerizable, unsaturated carboxylic acid, an
aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having 3 or 4 carbon

atoms or an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having 4 or
5 carbon atoms.
The use as claimed in claim 1 of a copolymer,
wherein the copolymer is employed in the form of an

aqueous polymer dispersion.
The use as claimed in claim 7, wherein the aqueous
polymer dispersion has a solids content of 40 to 70%

by weight, preferably 45 to 60% by weight.
The use as claimed in claim 8, wherein the aqueous
polymer dispersion has a viscosity in the range from 

1 to 20 PaÂ·s (measured by the Epprecht method).
The use as claimed in claim 1 of a copolymer,
wherein the copolymer is employed as a dispersion

powder.
The use as claimed in claim 1 as an additive to an
industrial detergent or domestic detergent.
A detergent which contains a copolymer as claimed in
claim 1, those copolymers being excluded which

comprise styrene as the vinyl monomer.
A detergent as claimed in claim 12 which is a textile
detergent, detergent booster and/or laundry

after-treatment agent.
A detergent as claimed in claim 12, comprising an
anionic, nonionic and/or zwitterionic surfactant.
A detergent as claimed in claim 14, additionally
comprising a sequestering agent, an optical

brightener, an enzyme, a bleaching agent and if
appropriate a stabilizer and an activator and/or a

washing alkali.
