<ABSTRACT>
The invention of a continuous dosing device relates to the combination of a coarse dosing element (32) with a fine dosing element (31). Both dosing elements cooperate in such a way that the sum of the flow (33, 34) from the coarse dosing element (32) and that of the fine dosing element (31) together yield the total material flow quantity desired.

<CLAIMS>
Gravimetric continuous metering device, in which the throughflow 
quantity is constrolled by determination of the weight decrease over 

time, or continuous belt metering, in which the throughflow quantity is 
controlled by determination of weight against speed, particularly for 

large throughflow quantities, characterised thereby that a coarse 
metering element (32) is combined with a fine metering element (31), 

wherein both metering elements so co-operate that the sum of the 
throughflow quantities (33, 34) of the coarse metering element (32) and 

the fine metering element (31) yield the desired total material 
throughflow quantity. 
Continuous metering device according to claim 1, characterised 
thereby that means known in themselves are used for the regulation and/or 

control of the throughflow quantities fed by the coarse metering element 
(32) as also by the fine metering element (31).
