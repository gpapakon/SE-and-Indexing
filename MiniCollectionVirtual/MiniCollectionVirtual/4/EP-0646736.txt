<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a tensioning mechanism (10), particularly for chain or belt drives, e.g. the toothed belt of an internal combustion engine, which has a tensioning roller which can be actuated independently of the temperature by means of an actuating device (14) which has a spring-loaded (spring 16) actuating member (15) which can be displaced relative to the actuating device (14) as a function of the temperature and acts on the tensioning roller. The actuating member (15) compensates for changes in length caused by increasing age and loading. The actuating device (14) has a vibration-damping device (30) which acts on the actuating member (15) and by means of which vibrations excited by the belt are damped. This damping device has, in a cylinder (32), a piston (29) at the end of the actuating member (15). The cylinder spaces (55, 56) on both sides of the piston (29) are completely filled with hydraulic fluid. Arranged in the cylinder space (55) on that side of the piston (29) which faces away from the actuating member (15) is a compensating body (59) which contains at least one inner cavity (60) filled with gas.
