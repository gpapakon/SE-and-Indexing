<ABSTRACT>
An electronic competing game apparatus utilizes 
article image data representative of human, animal, and 

housings to obtain a competing result of this game. In the 
electronic competing game apparatus, the respective 

portions of the article is designated by operating a 
designation unit (32), and a plurality of article images 

are displayed on a display unit (24). A competing result 
between the respective article images displayed on the 

display unit (24) is judged by a judging unit (31) based 
upon both point data corresponding to the partial images 

for constituting the respective article images, and point 
data corresponding to numeral data produced in an irregular 

sequence. When the designation unit (32) is operated while 
the respective article images are attacking with each 

other, the irregularly set point data is added to the point 
data set to the respective article images. The competing 

results between the respective article images are 
determined based on the added point data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
electronic game playing method and an electronic game 
playing apparatus for judging a competing result with 
employment of article image data such as human, animals and 
housings. More specifically, the present invention is 
directed to a method and an apparatus capable of 
electronically playing a battle game, while displaying a 
plurality of fighters whose life powers are selected by a 
user on a display screen. Various sorts of game apparatuses with utilizing 
electronic appliances have been developed and are being 
marketed. For instance, the battle type television game 
apparatuses equipped with TV screens are widely spread. In 
the typical TV game apparatus, the game program data 
previously stored in the specific cassette tape magazine 
mounted on this TV game apparatus are read in response to 
the key operations, and then a user moves the character 
images displayed on the TV screen in accordance with this 
game program data, finally, the microcomputer judges the 
competing result between these character images. In this conventional TV game apparatus, the data used 
to judge the competing result are such data previously set 
in this cassette magazine as a portion of the game program. 
As a result, the conclusions of this competing result are 
predetermined, so that amusing TV game cannot be expected. To solve the above-explained drawback, U.S. Patent 
Application No. 148,975 entitled to T. MASE et al., "IMAGE 
DATA PROCESSOR" assigned to the same assignee as that of 
the present U.S. patent application, has proposed such an 
electronic game apparatus for playing the battle game with 
use of the article image data, e.g., a plurality of human, 
animals, or housings. In this electronic game apparatus, a 
plurality of article image data are produced by combining 
the portional image data with each other with regard to the 
respective portions, and a decision is made of the  
 
competing result between the respective article images 
based upon a comparison result in the magnitudes of the 
point data set in correspondence with the respective 
portion image data for constituting these plural article 
images. However, there is a recent trend that users want to 
enjoy the battle game with great flexibility. That is, 
since the competing result between the respective article 
images is determined based upon the comparison result in 
the magnitudes of the point data set in correspondence with 
the respective partial image data which constitute the 
respective
