<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical preparation comprising a growth hormone and asparagine as additive or buffering substance shows a very high stability against deamidation, oxidation and cleavage of peptide bonds. The stability of the product allows for the storing and shipment thereof in a lyophilized state or in the form of a dissolved or re-dissolved preparation at ambient temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stabilized pharmaceutical
formulation comprising growth hormone, to a method of making
such formulation, and the use of asparagine for stabilizing
a formulation of growth hormone.The growth hormones from man and from common domestic
animals are proteins of approximately 191 amino acids, synthesized
and secreted from the anterior lobe of the pituitary
gland. Human growth hormone consists of 191 amino acids.Growth hormone is a key hormone involved in the regulation of
not only somatic growth, but also in the regulation of metabolism
of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. The major effect
of growth hormone is to promote growth.The organ systems affected by growth hormone include the skeleton,
connective tissue, muscles, and viscera such as liver,
intestine, and kidneys.Until the development of the recombinant technology and the
cloning of the growth hormone gene now giving rise to production
of e.g. human growth hormone (hGH) and Met-hGH in industrial
scale, human growth hormone could only be obtained by
extraction from the pituitary glands of human cadavers. The
very limited supplies of growth hormone restricted the use
thereof to longitudinal growth promotion in childhood and
puberty for treatment of dwarfism, even though it has been
proposed for inter alia treatment of short stature (due to
growth hormone deficiency, normal short stature and Turner 
syndrome), growth hormone deficiency in adults, infertility,
treatment of burns, wound healing, dystrophy, bone knitting,
osteoporosis, diffuse gastric bleeding, and pseudoarthrosis.Furthermore, growth hormone has been proposed for increasing
the rate of growth of domestic animals or for decreasing the
proportion of fat in animals to be slaughtered for human consumption.Pharmaceutical preparations of growth hormone tend to be unstable.
Degradation products such as deamidated or sulfoxy-dated
products and dimer or polymer forms are generated -
especially in solutions of growth hormone.The predominant degradation reactions of hGH are 1) deamidation
by direct hydrolysis or via a cyclic succinimide intermeadiate
to form various amounts of L-asp-hGH, L-iso-asp-hGH,
D-asp-hGH, and D-iso-asp-hGH (ref 1-3), 2) oxidation of the
methionine residues in positions 14 and 125 (ref 4-9), and 3)
cleavage of peptide bonds.Deamidation especially takes place at the Asn in position
149.hGH is rather easily oxidized in positions 14 and 125, especially
in solution (4-8).The oxidation of hGH in solution forming sulfoxides is normally
due to the
