<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device (10) for controllable greasing of workpieces (11) in strip or blank form with a plurality of hollow greasing rollers (12-16) which are provided with a material permeable to grease, are aligned coaxially to one another, are each rotatably supported on a hollow shaft (17) and can be driven by a belt drive (18) which is connected to a motor (23) by a drive shaft (19, 20) mounted in a housing or a frame (21). In this arrangement, the greasing rollers (12-16) can be placed against the surface (11a, 11b) of the workpiece by means of actuating cylinders (20). The object on which the invention is based is to provide a device of the type stated at the outset in which the belt drives for driving the greasing rollers are distinguished by a constant belt tension, irrespective of the operating position of the rollers. This object is achieved, according to the invention, by virtue of the fact that the hollow shaft (17) is pivotably mounted on the drive shaft (19, 20) by way of a lever (28) and that the pivoting movement of this lever (28) can be performed by an actuating cylinder (20).

A device for the controllable greasing of workpieces 
(11) in strip or sheet bar form with a plurality of 

hollow greasing rollers (12 - 16), which are provided 
with grease-permeable material, are aligned coaxial to 

one another, are rotatably mounted on a hollow axle 
(17) in each case and are drivable by means of a belt 

drive (18), which is drivably connected via a drive 
shaft (19, 20) mounted in a housing or a frame to a 

motor (23), it being possible to apply the greasing 
rollers (12 - 16) to the workpiece surface (11a, 11b) 

via pressure medium cylinders (29), characterised in 
that the hollow axle (17) is pivotably mounted on the 

drive shaft (19, 20) via a lever (28) and the pivoting 
movement of this lever (28) can be effected by a 

pressure medium cylinder (29). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the pressure medium cylinder (29) is articulatedly 

connected at one end (29a) to the housing or frame (21) 
and at its other end (29b) to the lever (28). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the pressure medium cylinder (29) is arti
culatedly 
connected at one end (29a) to the housing or frame (21) 

and at its other end (29b) either to the hollow axle 
(17) or a frame (30) of the hollow axle (17) connected 

therewith. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the hollow axle (17) of a 

greasing roller (12 - 16) is cantilever mounted on the 
lever (28) at one end only and is pivotably mounted on 

the drive shaft (19, 20) via said lever (28).  
 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the hollow axle (17) of a 

greasing roller (12 - 16) is mounted at both ends on a 
lever (28) and is pivotably mounted on the drive shaft 

(19, 20) via said lever (28). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that each lever (28) is formed by two 

partial levers, which are coupled to one another in a 
distance-variable manner at their ends remote from the 

drive shaft (19, 20) on the one hand and the hollow 
axle (17) on the other. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that a plurality of levers (28) for 

pivoting a plurality of greasing rollers (12, 13; 14,-16) 
in the same direction of rotation (arrows 25; 26) 

are arranged on a common drive shaft (19; 20) and a 
plurality of drive shafts (19, 20) are drivable by the 

motor (23) via a common belt or chain drive (22). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the drive (22) of the drive 

shafts (19, 20) is formed by a belt drive.
