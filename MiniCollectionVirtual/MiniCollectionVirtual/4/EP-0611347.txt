<ABSTRACT>
The basis of the invention is a wiper arm (10), used in particular for cleaning a window of a motor vehicle. The wiper arm has a fastening part (11) for fastening it on a wiper shaft (17), a hinged part (12) pivotably mounted on the fastening part (11) and a pressure spring (14) hung on the one hand on the fastening part and on the other hand on the hinged part (12) or on a wiper rod (13) fastened to the hinged part (12). The fastening part (11) is cut out of sheet metal and has an essentially U-shaped cross section with a back (18) and two side legs (19) that project from the back (18) in the direction of the windshield. In order to maintain the back (18) closed, the pressure spring (14) engages at least one side leg (19) of the fastening part (11).

<CLAIMS>
A wiper arm (10), in particular for cleaning a 
windscreen of an automotive vehicle, including a fastening part 

(11) for fastening it on a wiper shaft (17), the fastening part 
(11) having a substantially U-shaped configuration in cross-section, 

including a back (18) and two side walls (19) pointing 
from the back (18) to the windscreen, a joint part (12) which is 

pivotably mounted on the fastening part (11), and a pressure 
spring (14) which is hinged on the joint part (12) or a wiper 

rod (13) fastened to the joint part (12), on the one hand, and 
on a pin (32) extending between the side walls (19) of the 

fastening part (11), on the other hand,
characterized
 in that the pin (32) is retained in 
holes (33) in the punched out sheet-metal side walls (19) and, 

for the axial securement, the pin (32) is deformed close to the 
inner side of a side wall (19) (Figure 2) or is axially secured 

in position by rivet heads (35) which abut on the outer sides of 
the side walls (19) (Figure 3), or the pin (32) is hollow at 

least towards its frontal ends and, in this configuration, the 
side walls (19) have indentations (40) projecting frontally into 

the pin (32) (Figure 4). 
A wiper arm as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the holes (33) are furnished 
with rim portions (34) which are directed inwardly, in 

particular. 
A wiper arm as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized
 in that the pin (32) is provided 
with at least one circumferential groove (36) for the fixation 

of the hinge point of the pressure spring (14) in the axial 
direction of the pin (32).
