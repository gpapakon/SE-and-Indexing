<ABSTRACT>
Detergent mixtures contain (a) alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglycosides having the formula R1-O-(G)p in which R1 stands for alkyl or alkenyl residues with 1 to 22 carbon atoms, (G) stands for a saccharide residue with 5 or 6 carbon atoms and p for numbers from 1 to 10; and (b) esterquats having the formula (II), in which R2CO stands for an aliphatic acyl residue with 12 to 22 carbon atoms and 0, 1, 2 or 3 double bonds, n equals 2 or 3 and X stands for halogenide, methosulphate or methophosphate, as well as further anionic, non-ionic and/or amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants, as required. These detergent mixtures are useful for preparing surface-active agents and for tertiary oil extraction.

<CLAIMS>
The use of detergent mixtures containing

(a) alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglycosides corresponding to formula (I):

R
1
-O-[G]
p

in which R
1
 represents alkyl or alkenyl radicals containing up to 22
carbon atoms, [G]
 is a sugar unit containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms and
p is a number of 1 to 10, and
b) esterquats corresponding to formula (II):


in which R
2
CO is an aliphatic acyl radical containing 12 to 22 carbon
atoms and 0, 1, 2 or 3 double bonds, n = 2 or 3 and X stands for

halide, methosulfate or methophosphate,

for the production of hair-care and body-care products.
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the detergent
mixtures are used together with anionic, nonionic and/or amphoteric or

zwitterionic surfactants.
The use claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the detergent
mixtures are used together with anionic surfactants selected from 
the group
consisting of alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkanesulfonates, olefin sulfonates,

alkyl ether sulfonates, glycerol ether sulfonates, Î±-methyl ester sulfonates,
sulfofatty acids, alkyl sulfates, fatty alcohol ether sulfates, glycerol ether 

sulfates, hydroxy mixed ether sulfates, monoglyceride (ether) sulfates, fatty
acid amide (ether) sulfates, sulfosuccinates, sulfosuccinamates, sulfotriglycerides,

ether carboxylic acids, alkyl oligoglucoside sulfates and/or alkyl
(ether) phosphates.
The use claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the detergent
mixtures are used together with nonionic surfactants selected from the group

consisting of fatty alcohol ethoxylates, polyol fatty acid esters, sorbitan esters
and polysorbates.
The use claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the detergent
mixtures are used together with amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants

selected from the group consisting of alkyl amidobetaines, aminopropionates,
aminoglycinates, imidazolinium betaines and sulfobetaines.
The use claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the ratio by
weight of alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglucosides to esterquats is 5:95 to 95:5.
