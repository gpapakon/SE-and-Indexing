<ABSTRACT>
A heat detector includes an external temperature 
detector (30) for detecting the external temperature outside the heat 

detector and an internal temperature detector (40) for detecting the 
internal temperature inside the heat detector. A microcomputer 

calculates a temperature difference between the external 
temperature detected by the external temperature detector and 

the internal temperature detected by the internal temperature 
detector. The microcomputer monitors the above-described 

temperature difference to detect an event that the temperature 
difference has remained greater than a predetermined value for a 

predetermined continuous time duration. If the microcomputer 
detects that the temperature difference has remained greater 

than the predetermined value for the predetermined continuous 
time duration, the microcomputer outputs an abnormal signal 

representing that the external temperature detector is abnormal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat detector for
use in a fire alarm system and the like.In a conventional heat detector, a thermistor is used
as a temperature detection element for detecting ambient
temperature around the heat detector. Several methods have been
proposed to detect that the thermistor is abnormal or not. For
example, when the thermistor is disconnected or short-circuited,
the output voltage of a temperature detection circuit
changes extremely in comparison with the normal output voltage.
When this detected output voltage is larger than a predetermined
maximum value or smaller than a predetermined minimum value, it
is determined that the thermistor has been disconnected or
short-circuited.However, when the characteristics of the thermistor
deteriorate due to a secular change, its resistance as measured
at a constant temperature will change gradually, and thus the
output voltage of the temperature detection circuit will not
change abruptly. Such a gradual change in resistance of the
thermistor due to the deterioration of its characteristics can
not be detected by the conventional techniques.US-A-5 142 099 describes a heat detector utilizing a
pair of elongated thermistor strands extending over substantially
the same path to provide redundancy. Abnormal
differences between the two thermistors are detected as
deterioration of the condition of one of the two
thermistors.When the temperature detection range of the heat
detector has been set for example to a range higher than -10°C,
it will be possible to assume that the deterioration of the
thermistor has occurred if a low temperature such as -20°C is 
detected. In this case, however, when the actual ambient
temperature around the heat detector is for example +20°C, even
if an incorrect value such as +10°C or +30°C is measured as a
result of the deterioration of the thermistor, it is impossible
to determine that the measuring result is incorrect. That is,
in the conventional technique, there is a problem that the
deterioration of the thermistor can not be detected for the
entire operation temperature range.When an element such as a transistor or a diode other
than a thermistor is used as the temperature detection element,
there is also a problem that the deterioration of the
temperature detection element can not be detected for the entire
operation temperature range.An object of the present invention is to provide a
heat detector in which the deterioration of the temperature
detection element may be surely detected for the entire
operation
