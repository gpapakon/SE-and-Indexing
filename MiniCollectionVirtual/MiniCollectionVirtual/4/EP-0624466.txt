<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the stamped printing of sheets of paper or card on a printing press (1), comprising a press cylinder (3) and a plate cylinder (4) of parallel axes. Prior to passing sheets between the cylinders (3, 4), a thin plate (13) covered with a photopolymer layer is fixed around the plate cylinder (4), on which layer is formed a pattern in relief and inside out, and the plate cylinder (4) is forcibly applied against the press cylinder (3) then, in order to print one face of the sheets (17b) as an impression, each sheet (17b) of paper or card is engaged between the cylinder (3, 4). The invention also relates to a device for the implementation of such a method.

Stamp printing process for paper or cardboard sheets 
on a printing machine (1) comprising a press cylinder (3) 

and a plate cylinder (4) of parallel axes, characterized 
in that prior to passage of the sheets between the 

cylinders (3,4), there is fixed around the plate cylinder 
(4) thin plate (13) covered with a photopolymer layer on 

which is formed a motif in relief and in negative, and the 
plate cylinder (4) is applied by force against the press 

cylinder (3), each sheet (17
b
) of paper or cardboard then 
being engaged between the cylinders (3,4) to print in 

recess one side of the sheet (17
b
). 
Stamp printing process according claim 1, 
characterized in that an ink such as a colour or a matt 

or glossy varnish is applied to the thin plate (13) using 
inking rollers (7a) to print in recess and simultaneously 

transfer the motif to the sheets. 
Stamp printing process according to any of claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the printing machine is an 

offset press (1). 
Stamp printing process according to claim 3, in 

which the offset press (1) comprises a second plate 
cylinder (5) characterized in that, prior to passage of 

the sheets, there is further fixed around the second plate 
cylinder (5) a printing plate (14) on which is formed a 

motif in positive, then an ink such as a colour or varnish 
is applied to the printing plate (14) using inking rollers 

(7a) and the ink is then transferred to the thin plate 
(13) to print the motif in recess and simultaneously 

transfer the ink to one side of the sheets. 
Stamp printing process according to claim 4, 
characterized in that each of the two opposite edges of  

 
the printing plate (14) are fixed in the jaws of fixing 

bars (12) and each fixing bar is mounted on the second 
plate cylinder. 
Stamp printing process according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that each of the two 

opposite edges of the thin plate (13) are fixed in the 
jaws of fixing bars (11) and each fixing bar (11) is 

mounted on the plate cylinder (4). 
Stamp printing device for paper or cardboard sheets 
comprising a press cylinder (3) and a plate cylinder (4) 

for implementation of the process according to any of the 
previous claims, characterized in that it comprises a thin 

plate (13) covered with a photopolymer layer on which is 
formed a motif in relief and in negative, fixing means 

(11) for the thin plate (13) around the plate cylinder (4) 
and adjustment means (9) for applying the plate cylinder 

(4) against the press cylinder (3). 
Stamp printing device according to claim 7, 
characterized in that it further comprises inking rollers 

(7a).
