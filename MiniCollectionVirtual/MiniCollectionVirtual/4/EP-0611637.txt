<ABSTRACT>
A clamp is shown for holding a log of paper while a 
log-saw or cutting machine cuts shorter lengths of 

toilet-paper rolls or rolls of kitchen towels or similar 
all-purpose wipers from the log. The clamp is arranged 

adjacent a seat or support for the log as well as adjacent a 
cutting blade. The clamp includes, for each log seat, and on 

opposite sides of a cutting plane (T-T) through which the 
blade passes, a pair of adjustable and symmetrically arcuate 

strips (212, 214) secured to supports (207, 209). The strips 
are of flexible material with end portions which tend to 

spring outwardly. A strap (222) is anchored to a retention 
holder (224) and an adjustment holder (246). The strap 

surrounds the pair of strips (212, 214) and can change the 
arrangement thereof. A drive (240, 262, 218) simultaneously 

adjusts both the length of the strap (222) and the 
symmetrical angular orientations of two appendixes (228A; 

228B) and, consequently, of two cradles (518) on which the 
strips are supported.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to an improvement to a device for 
supporting and restraining a log of paper in a machine for 
cutting the logs into shorter rolls of toilet paper, kitchen 
towels (all-purpose wipers) and the like, according to the 
preamble of claim 1. The invention also relates to a log 
cutting machine including said device. The machine for 
cutting logs into shorter rolls is often referred to as a 
"log saw" and includes a cutting blade which moves through a 
cutting plane as it cuts the logs. A device of the prior art 
is disclosed in European Patent Appl. 0526412, which 
corresponds to U.S. Application Serial No. 07/915,945. This 
known device, which can be provided for machines processing 
a single log, or, simultaneously, more than two or more logs 
in parallel array, can be quickly adapted to logs of 
different diameters. It includes, for each log: 
a) a clamp on both sides of the cutting plane; b) a pair of yielding and symmetrically arcuate strips, 
secured to relevant supports and with movable end portions, 
said strips tending to expand outwardly; c) a strap anchored to a retention holder and to an 
adjustment holder, and surrounding said pair of strips so as 
to vary their geometry in relation to the diameter of the 
logs being processed, the strap encircling approximately 
half of the log to be cut;  
 d) two oscillating cradles adjacent to the supports, which 
cradles conform to the configuration of the strips as the 
geometry of the strips change; and  e) an appendix fixed to each oscillating cradle and 
associated to each strip, to cooperate with adjustment and 
locking means.   The invention allows an easier and more accurate 
adjustment than that obtained by the above-mentioned known 
device. Substantially, the device according to the present 
invention, which is defined in claim 1, comprises a single 
drive (especially of mechanical type) to simultaneously 
obtain both the adjustment of the position of the adjustment 
holder(s) of the strap(s) and the symmetrical angular 
movement of the two appendixes and, consequently, of the two 
cradles. The device further includes an angularly movable 
actuating member and two connecting rods articulated to 
eccentric pins at diametrically opposite positions of said 
angularly movable actuating member. The two connecting rods 
are engaged to the two appendixes of the oscillating 
cradles, respectively, to cause symmetrical and simultaneous 
angular movement of said two appendixes and, consequently, 
of the two cradles. A drive is also

A clamping device for the retention of a log 
adjacent to the cutting plane in a log cutting machine, the 

clamping device being quickly adaptable to logs of different 
diameters while the cutting machine is operating, said 

clamping device including for each log and on each side of 
the cutting plane (T-T): 


a pair of yielding arcuate strips (212, 214) each 
having a first end fastened to a pertaining support (207, 

209) and a respective second free end, each strip being 
curved between its fixed end and its free end in such a 

matter that the strips together define a passage through 
which a log can move; 
a strap (222) partly surrounding said strips and 
extending around a portion thereof opposed to the fixed ends 

of said strips (212, 214), one end of the strap being 
anchored to a retention holder, the other end of the strap 

being fastened to an adjustment holder, the adjustment 
holder being movable for tightening respectively loosening 

the strap to adapt the geometry of the strips to the 
diameter of the log being processed, said strap (222) 

extending around approximately half the circumference of the 
log to be cut; 
two opposite oscillating cradles (218), each cradle  
 

supporting a pertaining strip and being pivotally fastened 
adjacent the support (207, 209) of the pertaining strip
