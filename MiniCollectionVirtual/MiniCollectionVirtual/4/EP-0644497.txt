<ABSTRACT>
A region of a semiconductor device to be 
analyzed is initially divided a plurality of fractional 

elements of predetermined configuration. With respect 
to each fractional element, adjacent element 

information is provided. Then, a new nodal point is 
added. Then, one fractional element having a 

circumscribed circle enclosing the new nodal point is 
retrieved. Another fractional elements adjacent the 

retrieved fractional element and having the 
circumscribed circle enclosing the new nodal point are 

retrieved for establishing a fractional element group 
of the fractional elements having the circumscribed 

circles enclosing the new nodal point. The fractional 
elements are established on the basis of the boundary 

of the fractional element group and the new nodal 
point. The adjacent element information is then added 

for respective of the newly established fractional 
elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
method and a system for dividing a region to be
analyzed (analyzing region) of a semiconductor device
in a device simulation technology. More specifically,
the invention relates to a method and a system for
dividing an analyzing region into triangular or
tetrahedral fractional regions.In fabrication of semiconductor device,
simulation has been performed employing a device
simulator which calculates physical amount in the
semiconductor device using a computer and deriving
electric characteristics, such as terminal current,
threshold voltage and so forth of a transistor. Upon
performing optimization of the transistor for attaining
optimal electric characteristics of the semiconductor
device, it can significantly save expense and period by
employing the device simulator in comparison with
experimentally fabricating actual LSI. Also, since the
physical amount in the semiconductor device is
calculated in the device simulator, it is possible to
check behavior of electron and hole within the 
semiconductor. Therefore, it becomes possible to use
it for clearing up the cause of impact ionizing
phenomenon which causes problem in fine MOSFET.In the device simulator, in order to obtain
the physical amount within the semiconductor
transistor, separative variation within the
semiconductor is analyzed by solving a partial
differential equation, such as Poisson equation
expressing relationship between a potential and a
carrier concentration and current continuity equation
and so forth expressing relationship between a
potential and a carrier concentration. A method for
solving such partial differential equation, there is a
method disclosed in Dan, "Process Device Simulation
Technology" (edited: Sangyo Tosho), pp 113 to 122. In
the above-identified literature, there is disclosed a
method, in which the semiconductor device is divided
into small fractional regions for calculating the
partial differential equation in discrete manner.As a unit for division of the semiconductor
device, quadrangular-shape configuration in the case of
three-dimensional division and rectangular
parallelpiped configuration in the case of two-dimensional
division are typically employed for
simplification. However, when the semiconductor device
is divided into quadrangular or rectangular
parallelpiped fractional regions and if the 
semiconductor device has oblique configuration, such
oblique configuration has to be approximated in the
stepwise manner to make it impossible to exactly
express the
