<ABSTRACT>
The raw lead to be refined, whether of mineral 
origin or from reclaiming operations, the particle 

size of which has been reduced to a range not larger 
than 50 mm, is leached in a suitable apparatus with a 

solution of ferric fluoroborate in fluoroboric acid. 
During the leaching step, lead gets dissolved, 
with ferric fluoroborate being reduced to ferrous 

fluoroborate according to the following reaction:


2 Fe (BF₄)₃ + Pb ---
>
 Pb(BF₄)₂ + 2Fe(BF₄)   (1)



 
   The leaching apparatus behaves hence as an 

external anode installed outside of the cell. 
The resulting solution is sent to the cathodic 
compartment of a diaphragm cell in which lead is 

deposited on a cathode of stainless steel, in compact, 
highly pure form, from which it is periodically won. 
The so depleted-of-lead solution is sent to the 
anodic compartment of the same cell, in which a 

suitable anode oxidizes ferrous fluoroborate to ferric 
fluoroborate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
purifying the impure lead contained in recovered lead 
fixtures and in scraps and processing wastes, with the 
melting processes being eliminated which are presently 
essential for the thermal refining or for the 
preparation of the suitable anodes for the 
electrolytic refining, in the event when this refining 
system is adopted. As known, the electrolytic lead refining is 
carried out in cells to which massive anodes are 
charged, which are manufactured by melting impure lead 
and casting it into suitable moulds, and cathodes, 
constituted by thin sheets of lead or stainless steel 
on which the refined lead is deposited owing to the 
effect of the electrical field established between the 
anode and the cathode. The electrolyte is generally constituted by an 
aqueous solution of lead fluorosilicate containing 
free fluorosilicic acid, and the addition of additives 
in order to obtain a deposit displaying good 
characteristics. The massive anodes of known type suffer from 
several drawbacks and limitations of practical 
character: first of all, the anodes which get 
exhausted have to be removed at pre-established time 
intervals, with the production cycle being 
discontinued. Furthermore, the so-said "anodic residues" which 
constitute from 20 to 25% of the initial weight have  
 
to be melted once more, and this is a further 
additional cost. The anodic sludges often get detached from the 
anodes, get accumulated on the bottom of the 
electrolytic cell, and must be periodically removed; 
furthermore, the sludges can get dispersed throughout 
the bath and constitute a polluting agent for the 
deposit. Then, it should be observed that the anodes to be 
refined should display a limited level of impurities 
(Cu, Sn, Sb, As, Bi), the total amount of which does 
not normally exceed 2-3%, and have normally to be 
submitted to a pre-refining process, with consequent 
slagging of 3-5 parts of lead per each part of 
impurities to be removed. The present refining system with massive anodes 
of impure metal displays the characteristic that the 
anodic surface is very close to the cathodic one, 
hence with a very similar current density, expressed 
as A/m2. It derives from the above that the cathodic 
current density, and, consequently, substantially, the 
production capacity of the facility, cannot be 
increased beyond certain threshold values, in order to 
prevent that anodes get passivated, or cathodic 
deposits of poor quality are obtained. The presence of sludges

 being removed from said solution, 
(c) feeding the filtered solution to an electrolytic 
cell of diaphragm type, in which lead gets 

deposited in pure form at the cathode and ferrous 
ions are oxidized to ferric ions at the anode, 

with the solution of ferric fluoroborate being 
thereby regenerated, 
(d) recycling the so-regenerated ferric fluoroborate 
solution to said step (a), in order to leach 

further lead. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in

larger than 50 mm, and preferably not larger than 20 

mm. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
