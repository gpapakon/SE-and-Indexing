<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotor for use in a positive
displacement motor or pump and wherein said rotor is
coated with a metal carbide and/or metal boride coating
to impart excellent wear-resistance and corrosion-resistance
properties to the rotor when used in abrasive
and/or corrosive environments.A Moineau type positive displacement device can
be used as a motor or pump by designing the rotor and
stator for the device with a particular shape such as a
spiral-helix screw shape to provide a progressive cavity
between the rotor and the stator. When operated as a
pump, the rotor turns within the stator casing fluid to be
moved along the progressive cavity from one end of the
pump to the other. When operated as a motor, fluid is
pumped into the progressive cavity of the device so that
the force of the fluid movement causes the shaft to rotate
within the stator. The rotational force can then be transmitted
through a connecting rod and drive shaft. Thus
the positive displacement device using a specifically designed
rotor and stator can be used as a motor or pump
depending whether the force of the fluid is pumped
through the motor whereupon it functions as a motor or
external force acts on the rotor and causes the fluid to
move so that it functions as a pump.In the most basic form of drilling oil and gas wells,
a rig motor supplies power to the many lengths of pipe
comprising the drill string, causing it to rotate and turn
the drilling bit at the bottom of the hole. Turning the drill
string from the surface results in a great deal of friction
and torsional stress in the upper portion of the drill string.
Friction between the drill pipe and the side of the well
bore, together with the elastic stretch and twist in the
drill pipe, cause an inconsistent weight to bear on the
bit. This is harmful to the bit and can also result in metal
fatigue failure in the drill string. Therefore, it is often advantageous
to utilize a motor at the bottom of the hole
as the motive force for the drilling bit, eliminating the
need to rotate the drill pipe. This results in reduction of
wear on the equipment, lowering of drilling weight requirements,
simplification of bottom hole drilling assemblies,
and improved cost effectiveness. Directional guidance
control is also possible with such systems. Such
a motor is less costly to run in many cases. A particular
design of motor that is especially well suited to downhole
applications is the positive displacement motor discussed
above in which a screw-shaped rotor is turned
within a
