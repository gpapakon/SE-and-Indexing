<ABSTRACT>
A printer featuring an optical data link between the printer's 
controller and its reciprocal, 

carriage-mounted printhead (26) is described. Print data 
are conveyed from the controller to 

the printhead (26) via a fixed point on the edge 
of the carriage (20) and status data may 

be conveyed in the reverse direction. Power 
is supplied to the printhead via 

dual parallel rails (16,18) on which the carriage (20) is 
supported for reciprocation by the chassis-mounted carriage drive motor. 

Preferably, the optical medium is infrared light, and uses conventional 

driver/receiver devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical link for conveying data
between a printer's controller and printhead. More particularly, the invention
concerns an optical link between a controller and a printhead that eliminates the
flexible ribbon cable requirement of conventional printers.Conventional printers having moving printheads convey data to and
from the printhead from and to a printed circuit board (PCB) connector in the
printer's controller via one or more expensive ribbon cables that endure
thousands of bending cycles; add weight to the printhead; and require protection
from radio-frequency interference (RFI), electrostatic discharge (ESD) and
electromagnetic interference (EMI). Because of their bending clearance
requirement on at least one end of the carriage and because of the connection
requirements between the cable and the printer chassis, ribbon cables increase the
footprint of a printer.JP-A-61 213 183 discloses an apparatus to eliminate the effects of
electrical noise and prevent mistransmission, featuring an optical data
link that carries a signal that is demodulated into a controlling signal
and a recording data signal, the signal being stored until such time
as it is required to drive a recording head.The invented printer provides, as claimed in claim 1 hereinafter, an optical data link between the
printer's controller and its reciprocating, carriage-mounted printhead. Print data
is conveyed to the controller to the printhead via a fixed point on the edge of the
carriage and status data is conveyed in the reverse direction. Power is supplied
to the printhead via dual parallel rails on which the carriage is supported for
reciprocation by a chassis-mounted carriage drive motor. Preferably, the optical
medium employs infrared (IR) light, and uses conventional driver/receiver
devices. Preferably, some form of data compression is helpful in achieving the
high data-transfer rates required for high resolution printing. Conventional ink-jet
printheads may be used, although other devices, e.g., smart drive heads (SDH),
may be used. SDH devices further lighten both the power and weight burden on
the printhead and make it possible further to integrate data decoder functions
into the printhead.As previously noted, conventional printhead connections use a
flexible ribbon cable which generates RFI and EMI, and which may also create  
ESD problems. The optical link of the invention eliminates the need for a
flexible ribbon electrical connection and the associated RFI, EMI and ESD
problems
