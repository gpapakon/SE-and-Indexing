<ABSTRACT>
A rotatable contactless RF signal coupler (26), which couples RF 
signals between an antenna (24) and an RF signal processor in a portable 

radio, along with an antenna (24) capable of operating in two modes is 
described herein. Specifically, the signal coupler (24) includes a transformer 

that is primarily located within the hinge formed by the housing of the radio 
and a rotatable flip portion (18). Substantially constant inductive coupling is 

maintained in the coupler regardless of rotation. The antenna (24) is capable 
of operating in a narrow band and a wide band mode to afford antenna 

operation through varied conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed generally to couplers which permit a
transfer of AC energy between objects which rotate relative to one another
and to an antenna capable of operating in two modes. The contactless
coupler is more specifically directed to a rotatable contactless signal
coupler which couples RF signals between an antenna and an RF signal
processor, such as a transmitter or a receiver, in a two-way radio.A difficulty exists whenever AC energy must be transferred between
objects which rotate relative to one another. Sliding contacts are one
solution but they have limited life due to wear and may cause electrical
noise. Flexible cables are another solution but these limit the rotation and
also often cause wear and noise.The conventional means for coupling signals, in portable two-way
radios and pagers, between the antenna and the signal processor has been
through the use of a coaxial connector found within the housing of the
particular device. Where the antenna is required to rotate relative to the
radio a new type of device is needed which is small, inexpensive, efficient,
and highly reliable for coupling RF energy to the antenna. This is
especially important where the antenna is to be located on a flip portion of a
portable two-way radio.Portable radios operate in varied and adverse locations. The desire
for smaller radios has severely limited the available antenna locations and
has degraded antenna performance due to its size and placement within
the device. For maximum performance the antenna should be as far as
possible from the operator. Newer models of the portable radios have been
designed with a flip that folds down for talking and folds up for storage in
the pocket. The flip portion is a good antenna location and the main case is
usually allocated for the radio electronics. The variations in proximity of
the antenna to the case and operator is so great that optimizing for any one
condition will invariably degrade performance in other equally likely
conditions. Therefore, the optimal antenna will be the one most tolerant of
the varying conditions. 
A dual input antenna system of WO-A-8 704 307 has a first input which
provides an impedance match over a first range of frequencies and a
second input which provides an impedance match over a second range of
frequencies. This effectively enables a narrow band antenna to operate and
provide a matched condition at two separate frequency ranges. A
connectorless antenna coupler includes a metal shield imensioned to
enclose a portion of a portable

<CLAIMS>
A dual mode antenna having a first two conductor transmission line
means (L1), and a second two conductor transmission line means (L2)

having an effective electrical length greater than a quarter wavelength,
said dual mode antenna characterised by each conductor of said first two

conductor transmission line means being coupled to a series capacitor
(C1,C2), each of said capacitors coupled to an open ended conductor of said

second two conductor transmission line means providing an apparent
short circuit at a point along said second transmission line means that is

about a quarter wavelength from said open end.
The dual mode antenna according to claim 1 wherein said
capacitors (C1,C2) are of unequal value thus forming an effective generator

that results from the difference of the voltage across each of said capacitors
(C1,C2), said effective generator driving said antenna in a different mode.
