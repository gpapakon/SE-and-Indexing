<ABSTRACT>
A contrast agent useful for imaging a sample comprising a suspension in a medium acceptable for imaging (a) particles of a contrast agent possessing paramagnetic characteristics and (b) particles of a contrast agent possessing diamagnetic characteristics. Also disclosed is a method of imaging a sample which comprises introducing into the sample the above-described contrast agent and generating a substantially artifact-free image thereof. The combination of diamagnetic barium sulfate and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) in one suspension produces a macroscopic cancellation of positive and negative magnetic susceptibility components which eliminates susceptibility artifacts even with gradient echo pulse sequences. The relaxation properties which make the SPIO suspension a useful negative contrast agent are retained.

<DESCRIPTION>
Research leading to the completion of the invention
was supported, in part, by IRB Grant No. 70-91 provided
by Advanced Magnetics, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and
IRB Grant No. 457-90 provided by E-Z-EM, Inc. of Westbury,
New York.The present invention relates to magnetic resonance
imaging contrast agents.It is well known to enhance NMR (nuclear magnetic
resonance) images by, prior to conducting the imaging,
introducing into the sample to be imaged ferromagnetic,
diamagnetic or paramagnetic particles which shadow the image
produced to intensify and contrast the image generate by the
NMR sensitive nuclei. See, for example,
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,731,239; 4,863,715; 4,749,560; 5,069,216;
5,055,288; 5,023,072; 4,951,675; 4,827,945 and 4,770,183.A disadvantage associated with the use of NMR
image contrast agents, however, resides in the fact that the
internal magnetic properties of the various contrast agents
employed heretofore affect the applied external field during
the imaging process. These interactions of the paramagnetic
or diamagnetic properties of the contrast agents with the 
applied external magnetic field give rise to irregularities
in the resulting image, commonly referred to as imaging
artifacts.The application of magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to abdominal imaging is potentially revolutionary, but
currently is seriously limited by the inability to distinguish
tumors, abscesses and other abnormalities from normal
structures, e.g., bowel. As for computed tomography, the
use of oral or rectal contrast agents is expected to
dramatically improve the diagnostic value of MRI for
abdominal diseases. Currently, superparamagnetic iron oxide
(SPIO) is the best oral contrast agent available for use in
MRI.Iron oxide acts as a gastrointestinal (GI) MRI
contrast agent primarily due to the dipolar interaction of
the unpaired electrons of iron with the water protons in the
body. In addition, its internal magnetization aligns parallel
to an applied external field, increasing the magnetic
field strength nearby. This is known as positive magnetic
susceptibility, and also leads to large field gradients near
the articles. Both of these mechanisms cause loss of signal
intensity within the bowel. This loss of signal causes the
desired enhancement of the difference in the appearance of
bowel and other normal and abnormal structures in magnetic
resonance images.A problem with SPIO suspensions in the past has
been that they not only affect the volume that actually 
contains the suspension (i.e., bowel), but also
