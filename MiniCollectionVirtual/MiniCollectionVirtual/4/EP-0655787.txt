<ABSTRACT>
A transistor (200) comprises a single, common base 
region (202). One or more source regions (112) are formed in 

the base region (202). One or more gate regions (120) overly 
the common base (202) and the source regions (112). In an 

alternate embodiment, the gate regions (320) have a raised 
central portion (321). In yet another embodiment, certain 

source regions (402) are cross connected (404). Additionally, a 
polysilicon pattern (602) may be used which provides a gate 

finger feed network (614, 616,618), and gate fingers (604, 
606, 608, 620) having length less than one half of the longest 

die dimension.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor devices, 
and more particularly to transistors having common base 
regions and transistors having efficient and effective layout. In the past, vertical-type transistors such as power 
MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Silicon Field Effect Transistor) have 
comprised discrete and separate base region cells which define 
discrete and separate active regions. In a typical device die 
comprising many of such regions, the regions are electrically 
coupled together so that they act as a single transistor. 
Seperate cells give rise to certain disadvantages. For example, 
the base-emitter region of every cell must be shorted for 
maximum energy. In addition, cell corners have adverse effects 
on breakdown voltage. Furthermore, transistor configurations which are 
alternative to cells, such as stripes, have given rise to 
particular disadvantages. For example, striped-layout 
transistors inherently comprise elongated gate fingers. 
Electrical contact must be made to these elongated gate 
fingers in order to turn on or turn off the transistor. 
Conventionally, electrical connection to the elongated gate 
fingers are made at their extreme ends. Contacting the gate 
fingers at their ends creates a resistance to the gate finger 
which varies along its length. Consequently, the transistor's 
performance characteristics vary along the length of the gate  
 
finger. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that 
this condition is undesirable. Consequently, what is needed is a transistor which avoids 
the problem of individual, seperate cells. Furthermore, what is 
needed is a transistor which has an efficient and effective 
layout such that transistor performance parameters do not vary 
materially at different locations of the device. FIG. 1 is a simplified cross-sectional view of a vertical 
MOS transistor in accordance with one embodiment of the 
present invention; FIG. 2 is a simplified top view of a transistor in 
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 3 is a simplified cross-sectional view of an 
alternative embodiment of a transistor in accordance with the 
present invention; FIG. 4 is a partial top view of an alternative embodiment 
of a transistor in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 5 is a simplified cross-sectional view of an 
alternative embodiment of a transistor in accordance with the 
present invention; FIG. 6 is a simplified top view illustrating the layout of a 
transistor die including patterned polysilicon forming gate 
fingers
