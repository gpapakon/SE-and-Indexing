<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to human monoclonal 
antibodies against human cytokines and methods of making, identifying 
and using such antibodies, preferably human monoclonal antibodies 
against human cytokines or lymphokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, 
IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, etc. The applicability of human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs), 
especially HuMAbs to human cytokines, in therapy holds great promise. 
See, for example, Griffiths et al., EMBO J., 12 : 725-734 (1993) and the 
review in Larrick et al., J. Biol. Response Modif., 5 : 379 (1986). However, 
the production of useful HuMAbs against human cytokines has proven 
difficult. Specifically, while the possible existence in human serum of 
autoantibodies to human cytokines is mentioned in numerous articles 
(Suzuki et al., J. Immunol., 145 : 2140-2146 (1990) (IL-1α); Hansen et al., 
Immunol. Letters, 30 : 133-140 (1991) (IL-1α); Bendtzen et al., Immunol. 
Today, 11 : 167-169 (1990) (IL-1α and TNF-α); Bendtzen et al., Immunol. 
Today, 10 : 222 (1989) (IL-1α and TNF-α); Saurat et a., J. Allergy Clin. 
Immunol., 88 : 244-256 (1991) (IL-1α); Suzuki et at., Clin. Exp. Immunol., 
85 : 407-412 (1991) (IL-1α); Sunder-Plassmann et at., Kidney International, 
40 : 787-791 (1991) (IL-1α); Gallay et at., Eur. Cytokine Netw., 2 : 329-338 
(1991) (IL-1α and IL-1β); Mae et at., Lymphokine Cryokine Res., 10 : 61-68 
(1991) (IL-1α); Fomsgaard et at., Scand. J. Immunol., 30 : 219 (1989) 
(TNF-α); Hansen et at., Scand. J. Immunol., 33 : 777-781 (1991) (IL-6);  
 
Crabtree et at., Scand J. Immunol., 37 : 65-70 (1993)(IL-8); Bost et al., 
Immunology, 65 : 611-615 (1988)(IL-2); Ross et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol., 
82 : 57-62 (1990)(IFN-α2b and IFN-γ); and Caruso et at., J. Immunol., 
144 : 685-690 (1990)(IFN-γ)), no one has been able to produce an isolated 
and purified HuMAb to a human cytokine, especially a HuMAb having high 
affinity, e.g., a Ka of above about 10⁹ M⁻¹. Some of the reasons are 
pointed out in the Griffiths et at. article:
 
   "Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have huge 
potential for therapy, but are difficult to make by 
immortalizing B-lymphocytes. Furthermore, it is 
especially difficult to generate human mAbs directed 
against human antigens (anti-self antibodies), for 
example antibodies against soluble TNF to block septic 
shock, against membrane bound carcinoembryonic 
antigen to image colorectal carcinoma or against 
lymphocyte antigens to destroy tumour in lymphoma. 
This difficulty results from immunological tolerance 
mechanis
