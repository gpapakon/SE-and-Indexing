A collapsible drum comprising flange plates (1) 
associated with a hub (2) made up of hinged elements (3), 

each of which comprises two portions (4) having respective 
ends that face each other and that are connected together, 

and respective opposite ends that are connected to 
respective ones of the flange plates (1) via hinge means 

disposed so that the portions (4) of each of the hinged 
elements are substantially in alignment and are 

substantially perpendicular to the flange plates when the 
drum is in an in-use position, and so that the portions of 

each of the hinged elements are collapsed so that they 
extend along a direction that is substantially parallel to 

the flange plates when the drum is in a storage position, 
the portions of the hinged elements being provided with 

respective side surfaces (11) disposed so as to touch one 
another in substantially radial planes of the hub when the 

drum is in the in-use position, said collapsible drum being 
characterized in that the portions (4) of the hinged 

elements (3) have end faces (10) that are substantially 
perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the portions, 

and in that the hinge means comprise resilient 
members (5, 6). 
A collapsible drum according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the resilient members (5, 6) are under tension when the 

drum is in the in-use position. 
A collapsible drum according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the flange plates (1) are provided with collars (13) 

which project into the hub, and in that the portions (4) 
have ends that are adjacent to the flange plates and that 

are disposed so as to bear against the collars (13) when the 
drum is in the in-use position. 
A collapsible drum according to claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one of the end faces of the portions of the  

 
hinged elements is provided with a positioning member (14) 

that co-operates with a facing additional member (15) when 
the drum is in the in-use position. 
A collapsible drum according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the portions of the hinged elements are hollow and the 

resilient members are studs, each of which comprises an 
elongate resilient central body (7) extending through the 

facing walls of the hinged elements and of the flange 
plates, and two abutment heads (8) connected to the ends of 

the central body (7). 
A collapsible drum according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the rest length (
l
) of the central body (7) is less 
than the thickness (E) of the walls through which the 

central body extends (7). 
A collapsible drum according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the portions of the hinged elements are provided with 

notches (19), and in that the resilient members (5, 6) 
comprise resilient rings engaged in the notches. 
A collapsible drum according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it is provided with at least one reinforcing and 

locking member (22, 27) extending axially inside the hub (2) 
and providing a resilient link tending to urge the flange 

plates (1) towards each other. 
A collapsible drum according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the reinforcing and locking member comprises a 

resilient cable (27) that is fixed to the ends of the 
portions of the hinged elements so also to act as hinge 

means between the portions (4) of the hinged elements and 
the flange plates. 
A collapsible drum according to claim 8, characterized 
in that the reinforcing and locking member comprises a cable  

 
(22) connected to the flange plates via resilient link 

members (24).
