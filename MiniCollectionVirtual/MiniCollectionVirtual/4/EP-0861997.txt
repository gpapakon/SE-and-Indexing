<ABSTRACT>
A power tool with a rotation motor, a rotating output shaft
(26), and an angle drive (11) connecting the motor to the

output shaft (26) and comprising a gear casing (12), a
pinion gear (14) connected to the motor, a crown wheel (17)

connected to the output shaft (26), and a lubricant
dispensing means including a receptacle (28) immovably

supported in the gear casing (12) and having a peripheral
side wall (30,31) and an end wall (29), wherein the end

wall (29) is formed with a through opening (43)for the
output shaft (26) and an outlet opening (43) for the

lubricant, and an agitator element (44) is freely movable
within the receptacle (28) for agitating the lubricant by

vibratory movements during operation of the tool, thereby
fascilitating spreading of the lubricant toward the outlet

opening (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a power tool of the type having a
rotation motor drivingly connected to an output shaft via
an angle drive.In particular, the invention concerns a power tool of the
above type in which the angle drive comprises a gear
casing, a bevelled pinion gear connected to the motor, a
bevelled crown wheel connected to the output shaft and
intermeshing with the pinion gear, and a lubricant
dispensing means located in the gear casing and arranged to
provide a lubricant to the angle drive.A problem inherent in many angle type power tools, like
rotation grinding or cutting tools, relates to the limited
service life of the angle gear. This is mainly due to an
insufficient lubrication of the gear teeth of the pinion
gear and crown wheel, resulting in a severe frictional wear
and heat development in the gearing.Previously, lubrication of the angle gear has been
accomplished simply by filling the gear casing from new
with a certain amount of grease and adding some more grease
after certain operation intervals. This, however, has
turned out to be less satisfactory, because after a
relatively short time of tool operation the heavier
components of the grease, i.e. the components of higher
viscosity, are deposited on the gear casing walls, whereas
the lighter components, i.e. the components of lower
viscosity, tend to leak out from the gear casing through
the output shaft seal means. Such a leakage is larger in
pneumatic power tools, because in those tools there is
always a certain superatmospheric pressure prevailing in
the angle gear casing. The above problems means that the lubrication intervals
have to be rather short not to risk dry operation of the
angle gear. It has to be observed, though, that too large
an amount of grease in the gear casing will cause a
detrimental overheating of the grease as well as the entire
angle gear due to internal friction or hysteresis in the
grease.Previous attempts have been made to solve this problem by
providing different types of lubricant dispensing means. In
US Patent No. 3,719,254 there is described a power tool
angle drive according to the preamble of claim 1, in which a lubricant reservoir is mounted on
the output shaft for corotation therewith. This reservoir
encloses an absorbent sleeve element which is soaked with a
lubricant of a relatively low viscosity and which is
arranged to dispense that lubricant by centrifugal action
onto the gear teeth at operation of the tool. A drawback
with this known device is the limitation in size of the
reservoir. Its
