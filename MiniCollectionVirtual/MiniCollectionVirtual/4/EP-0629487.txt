<ABSTRACT>
In a method for manufacturing laminated plastic articles (8), which comprise an injection-moulded basic body (2 to 6) of thermoplastic material and at least one outer layer (7), the mould half (11a, 12a) of the injection mould which receives the basic body being temporarily brought into congruence with a complementary mould half (12b) of a compression mould, which presses the outer layer against the basic body and laminates it against the latter, the side of the injection-moulded basic body (2 to 6) facing the outer layer (7) is heated up between the injection moulding and the laminating (embossing) operation. For this purpose, an injection unit (9) is assigned a clamping unit (10) having at least two moulds (11, 12), each comprising two mould halves, of which one mould half of the second mould (12) is designed as a compression-mould mould half (12b), with a contour corresponding to the basic body (2 to 6) plus the outer layer (7), and a heating device (21) which can be introduced between the opened mould halves is assigned to the first or the second mould (11, 12).
