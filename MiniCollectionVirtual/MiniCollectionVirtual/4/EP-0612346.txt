<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the stabilization or marine oils, 
more particularly of fully or partially refined marine oils. Marine oils have attracted substantial interest as a source of 
long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid 
(DHA), which are considered to be of dietary significance. These fatty 
acids contain 5 or 6 double bonds, which render them prone to 
atmospheric oxidation. It is believed that the peroxides produced in 
this oxidation break down to secondary oxidation products, which 
exhibit a pronounced taste and smell of fish. It has been known for a long lime that refined marine oil is 
initially free from a taste and smell of fish, but that reversion through 
oxidation occurs rapidly. Attempts have been made to stabilize the oil 
by the addition of α-tocopherol or mixed tocopherols at a level of 
0.1%, but this has resulted only in a short term improvement in 
stability, i.e. a few days. Stabilization with tetrabutylhydroquinone 
has also been proposed, but this is of very restricted application 
having regard to the extremely bitter taste of this compound. There has accordingly been a need for a process by means of 
which such marine oil can be stabilized over a long period in a simple 
and economical manner. It has now surprisingly been found in accordance with the 
present invention that fully or partially refined marine oil can be 
stabilized over a longer period than hitherto, particularly over several 
months, by treating the oil with silica and incorporating a lecithin. 
ascorbyl palmitate and a tocopherol in the thus-treated oil. The present invention is, based on the foregoing finding and is 
accordingly concerned with an improved process for the stabilization of fully or 
partially refined marine oil,  
 
by means of lecithin, ascorbyl palmitate and a tocopherol and involving a 
silica treatment, comprising treating said oil with silica having a surface 
area greater than 500 m² per gram, subjecting said silica treated oil to a soft 
vacuum steam deodorization at a temperature between about 140°C and 
about 210°C, and incorporating a lecithin, ascorbyl palmitate and a 
tocopherol in the ratio of 6-3 : 4-2 : 8-4 in the thus-treated oil, whereby the 
stabilization brought about lasts for several months.  
 The partially purified marine oil used in the present invention is 
one which has been neutralized and bleached in a conventional 
manner and the fully refined marine oil, also
