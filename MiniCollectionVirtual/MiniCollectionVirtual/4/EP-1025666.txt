<ABSTRACT>
An error control apparatus and method is disclosed, wherein a control message is used to request a retransmission of a received erroneous digital signal transmitted in a first direction via a transmission medium. The control message is transmitted in a second direction of said transmission medium, wherein the transmission rate of the control method is controlled in dependence on a usage of the transmission medium in the second direction and/or an amount of available memory in a receiving means (5) for receiving said digital signal. Thereby, the overall data throughput in the first and second direction can be optimized by changing the rate of the control message.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BIDIRECTIONAL ARQ APPARATUS AND METHODFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to an error control apparatus and method for a digital transmission system such as a General Packet Radio Services system (GPRS) having a transmission medium for performing transmission in a first and a second direction.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn a digital transmission system, transmission errors occur due to noise and distortion. There are two types of transmission errors: random errors and burst errors. Random errors may be caused by thermal noise. Burst errors are generated during a fade in the transmission channel.Transmission errors can be detected by adding a redundant signal (check bits) to the information signal. Upon detecting a transmission error, there are two ways to control the error. One is called ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) and uses a feedback control to request a retransmission of the corrupted data. The other, called FEC (Feed-Forward Error Correction) , uses a feed-forward control to control the errors.A system employing an ARQ scheme requests a retransmission of the data received in error. There are three ARQ strategies: (i) Stop-and- ait (ii) Go-Back-N, and (iii) Selective Repeat.In the Stop-and-Wait ARQ system, the receiver sends an ACK signal to acknowledge a correct reception, and sends a NAK signal to request a retransmission of a coded signal block detected in error. However, the efficiency of 

transmission is low, since a confirmation of the received signal is made for every block of data.In the Go-Back-N ARQ system, a coded data block is transmitted continuously. If the transmitter receives a NAK signal requesting a retransmission then the transmitter goes back by N data blocks and restarts the transmission from that data block. The time delay between the transmission of a data block and the reception of a NAK signal must be less than the time for the transmission of N data blocks. The idle time is shorter for this system than for the Stop-and-Wait ARQ system. However, it still wastes time, since N data blocks, which may include blocks with error, are transmitted for every retransmission.In the Selective Repeat ARQ system, data blocks are sent continuously and only the blocks in error are retransmitted. Thus, this system has the highest efficiency. The management of the order of data blocks and the buffer is more complicated for this system compared to the other systems.Moreover, a method is known where an erroneous block is stored and used as a diversity when retransmission
