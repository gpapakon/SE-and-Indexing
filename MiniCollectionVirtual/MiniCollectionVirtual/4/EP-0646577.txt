<ABSTRACT>
1,4-Disubstituted-5(4H)-tetrazolinones of the formula (I) 

(wherein R¹, R² and R³ have the meanings given in the specification), which are 
known to be useful as herbicides, can be obtained in very good yields by reacting 

the corresponding 1-substituted-5(4H)-tetrazolinones with the corresponding 
carbamoyl chlorides in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the production of known 1,4-disubstituted-5(4H)-tetrazolinones
which can be utilized, for example, as
agricultural chemicals.Regarding the synthesis of tetrazolinones of the type of general formula (I) below,
there is generally known, for example, a process wherein a tetrazolinone
compound represented by the general formula:

wherein
Mrepresents hydrogen or an alkali metal selected from the group consisting
of Li, Na and K etc.,
is reacted with a carbamoyl chloride (U.S. Patent 4,618,365).Concerning the above-mentioned reaction, when use is made, as M, of a hydrogen
atom, it is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable acid-acceptor such
as pyridine, trialkylamine and the like. Further, in this reaction, use may be made,
as suitable solvents, of acetone, acetonitrile, toluene, chloroform and the like. The essential reaction of a triazolinone compound of formula
(II) below with a carbamoyl chloride of formula (III) below,
in the presence of an inert solvent and optionally in the
presence of an acid binder, to produce 1,4-disubstituted 5(4H)-tetrazolinones
of the type of general formula (I) below - in
average yields of about 70 % of theory -, is also described in
certain intermediate prior art documents (EP-A-0 612 735,
EP-A-0 578 090, EP-A-0 572 855, EP-A-0 571 855 and EP-A-0
571 854), 4-dimethylamino-pyridine (4-DMAP) being listed in
each of these documents as a possible acid-binder amongst many
others, where the amount of 4-DMAP used is not specified. However, such known process produces, in addition to the desired tetrazolinones,
the isomeric compounds represented by the following general formula (A):

(referred to as "O-carbamoyl compounds"hereinafter) as by-products and the
production rate of such by-products sometimes turns out to be as much as one
third of the production rate of the desired compounds (Figs. 1 to 5).The O-carbamoyl compound by-products do not exhibit such herbicidal activity as
shown by the aimed N-carbamoyl tetrazolinones, while these O-carbamoyl
compounds as such are chemically unstable, i.e. they are readily hydrolyzable by
aqueous acids and alkali so that the separation and removal procedure of O-carbamoyl
compounds from the desired N-carbamoyl products (I) gives rise to a
substantial technical difficulty.Thus the known process has a serious inherent defect in view of reaction procedure
and reaction efficiency.To solve the above-mentioned technical problem, there has now been found a
process - with two process
