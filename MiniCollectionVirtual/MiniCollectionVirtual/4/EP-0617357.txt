<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus are provided for feedback of 
object size during direct manipulation. In one embodiment, 

the invention determines whether the file size of an 
object being directly manipulated exceeds a threshold and, 

if the file size exceeds the threshold, varies the mouse 
tracking speed. The mouse tracking speed is preferably 

reduced if the file size exceeds an upper threshold and 
increased if the file size exceeds (falls below) a lower 

threshold. The mouse tracking speed is preferably restored 
to its unvaried value upon the conclusion of the 

direct manipulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data processing
systems and in particular to data processing systems that
provide graphical user interfaces that permit direct manipulation
operations.
A data processing system may be provided with a
graphical user interface that permits direct manipulation
of displayed objects with an on-screen graphical selector,
called a pointer, of a mouse, trackball or other pointing
device. A graphical user interface may display objects,
such as system resources and data files, as icons on a
display device such as a display monitor. A system resource
may be a device such as a printer which may be
represented on the graphical user interface as a printer
icon. A data object may be a text file which may be represented
in the graphical user interface as a file icon. A
person, called a user, who is operating the data processing
system may perform various operations by using the
pointer to "drag" an object about on the display device.
Thus, a user may, through direct manipulation using a
pointing device, drag the data object's file icon and drop
it upon the display printer device's printer icon, thereby
causing the display printer to print the data file.The displayed appearance of an icon, including both
the graphical component and any text accompanying it, may
be user selectable and user editable. The displayed appearance
of an icon may vary automatically in accordance 
with the state of the object represented by the icon.
Thus, a mailbox icon may change appearance to indicate the
presence of new mail, a trash can icon may bulge to show
that it contains deleted objects that may be recovered, or
a printer icon may change to indicate that the printer has
run out of paper.The pointer is displayed on the desktop. The user
may manipulate a pointing device such as a mouse or
trackball to move the pointer about on the desktop. The
user may specify the sensitivity or "mouse tracking speed"
of the pointer to movement of the pointing device by adjusting
the amount of screen movement of the pointer for a
given movement of the pointing device. Similarly, a user
may enable or disable pointer acceleration and adjust the
amount of pointer acceleration. Pointer acceleration
causes greater movement of the displayed pointer for faster
movement of the pointing device over the same distance.During direct manipulation operations, an icon may be
dragged about the desktop with a pointer and dropped on
eligible target objects. The displayed appearance of the
pointer may change to a "do not" pointer when a
