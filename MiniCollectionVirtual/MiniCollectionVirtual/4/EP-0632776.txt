<ABSTRACT>
An article group transfer apparatus constructed and arranged to move article groups into open ends of the carton sleeves. The apparatus (16) is incorporated in a continuous motion cartoner assembly for loading article groups (23) into cartons which comprises an article infeed mechanism (13, 14) supplying at least one stream of articles; an article group selection and transport mechanism (12) intersecting the article infeed mechanism to form and transport a longitudinal stream of article groups of a predetermined pattern; a carton supply and transport mechanism (11) synchronized and moving parallel with the article group selecting mechanism to provide cartons with open ends facing the moving article groups; and the article group transfer apparatus (16) which moves the article groups into the open ends of the carton sleeves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods 
used in the packaging industry. Particularly, this 
invention relates to an article group transfer 
mechanism for use in continuous motion cartoner 
assemblies which load article groups into cartons or 
packages. The article group transfer mechanism is a 
side or crossloading-type device. The apparatus of this 
invention enables the loading of different types, 
styles and sizes of articles, such as cans and bottles, 
and a wide range of article group patterns, both 
stacked and unstacked, into paperboard or other cartons 
in a fast and reliable manner. In the past, various machines and processes have 
been proposed and utilized to package selected article 
groups into cartons by loading such article groups from 
the side or sides of the carton. Each prior art 
machine and process, however, accomplishes the 
packaging of the article groups in a distinct manner 
and utilizes particular structure. Moreover, prior art 
devices have limited adjustability, limited output 
capability, and have been difficult to construct and 
maintain due to their respective designs. In view of the limitations and shortcomings of 
prior art methods and apparatus, it is an object of 
this invention to provide an apparatus which  
 
continuously and reliably cartons predetermined product 
groups at high speed. Another object of this invention 
is to provide a continuous motion cartoner which is 
adjustable for use with a variety of cartons, articles 
and article group types and sizes. A further object of 
the invention is to provide article group transfer 
structures which enable an article group to be moved and 
controlled with a positive force so that the article 
group may be tightly placed and maintained in a carton. 
Another object of the invention is to provide article 
group transfer structures having transversely 
reciprocating arm assemblies including cam actuated 
stepped transfer heads for loading product groups in an 
initially nested configuration having a differentially 
thinner loading dimension. A further object of this 
invention is to provide article group transfer structures 
which are stabilized for high speed operation. US-A-4936077 discloses a carton loading machine 
comprising a frame and means for displacing article 
groups into the open end of a carton. The movements of 
pusher assemblies are guided by a guide track assembly. 
The disclosure of this document corresponds generally to 
the preamble of claim 1. According to the present invention, there is 
pro

<CLAIMS>
A lateral transfer apparatus (16) for use in a 
continuous packaging system (10) of the type wherein 

article groups (23) comprising at least one article being 
transported in a longitudinally oriented stream are 

loaded into open sides of synchronised article packages 
travelling in a second longitudinal stream, comprising a 

frame, a plurality of transfer elements (110) disposed at 
predetermined longitudinally spaced intervals, said 

transfer elements being for laterally moving article 
groups which are being longitudinally transported in an 

article group transport stream, means to longitudinally 
move said transfer elements, and means to laterally move 

said transfer elements; the apparatus being characterised 
in that each article group is disposed on a slide plate 

(154) and aligned for entry into a package, wherein the 
slide plate has an elongated, laterally oriented slot 

(155) of a predetermined width, and in that there is 
further provided a stabilization member (145) disposed on 

each said transfer element for mating insertion into said 
slide plate slot during lateral extension of said 

transfer elements. 
A lateral transfer apparatus according to claim 1, 
wherein the transfer elements (110) comprise loading arm 

assemblies each having a base plate (127) and a contact 
member (128). 
A lateral transfer apparatus according to claim 2, 
wherein the contact member comprises a loading head with 

removable face members (134, 135).  
 
A lateral transfer apparatus according to any 
preceding claim, wherein said transfer elements (110) are 

constructed and arranged along an endless longitudinally 
oriented loop to be conveyed longitudinally in a top, 

forward run and a bottom, return run on said frame 
structure. 
A lateral transfer apparatus according to claims 2 
or 3 and 4, wherein said transfer elements (110) comprise 

a support member connected to said contact member (128) 
and to said longitudinal movement means, and a control 

member connected to said support member and to said 
lateral movement means to direct the lateral movement of 

said transfer elements. 
A lateral transfer apparatus according to claim 5, 
wherein said support member comprises a laterally 

oriented, elongated base member having a first end at 
which said contact member is disposed and a second end, 

at least one bearing block disposed proximate each said 
base member end, and at least one slide rail aligned and 

disposed spacially parallel with respect to said base 
member and slidably mated with said bearing blocks, said 

slide rail further being connected to said longitudinal 
movement means. 
A lateral transfer apparatus according to claim 6, 
wherein said lateral movement means comprises a cam track 

having a predetermined configuration. 
A lateral transfer apparatus according to claim 7, 
wherein said control member comprises a cam follower  

 
connected to said support member, said cam follower being 

cooperatively mated with said cam track. 
A lateral transfer apparatus according to claim 7 or 
8, wherein said cam track configuration provides a 

constant rate of lateral extension to said transfer 
elements throughout a majority of a total extension path 

of each said transfer element, said cam track 
configuration further providing a decreased rate of 

lateral extension at a predetermined segment of said 
transfer element extension path for making smooth contact 

with the article. 
A lateral transfer apparatus according to claim 6, 
wherein said longitudinal movement means comprises a pair 

of parallel, spaced driven chains each supported by a 
rectilinear guide along a top, forward longitudinal run 

thereof, each said support member slide rail being

to the other chain. 
A lateral transfer apparatus according to any 
preceding claim, wherein the apparatus is used to load 

article groups comprising at least one article into the 
open sides of synchronized article carriers in a 

continuous packaging process.
