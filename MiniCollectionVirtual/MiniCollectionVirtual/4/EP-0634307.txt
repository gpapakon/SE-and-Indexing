<ABSTRACT>
A roofrack for vehicles is described having two supporting strips (4) which are fastened to the vehicle roof (1), respectively extend from a first position, in which they extend at least approximately parallel to one another along the lateral edges of the roof surface, to a second position in which they extend transversely across the vehicle roof (1), are pivotable about a vertical axis (6) and can be locked in any of these positions. In order to obtain arrangement of the supporting strips (4) close to the vehicle roof in the non-use position and arrangement of the supporting strips (4) some distance from the roof in the position of use, provision is made for the supporting strips (4) to be displaceable in addition along the vertical axis (6) and to be lockable in a lower and in an upper vertical position.

A roof rack for vehicles with two support strips 
(4), which are fixed on the roof (1) and are rotatable 

from a first position, in which they extend at least 
approximately parallel to each other along the lateral 

edges of the roof surface, to a second position, in 
which they extend transversly on top of the roof (1), 

around a vertical axis (6), and are fixable in each 
position, characterised in that said strips (4) are 

additionally movable along the vertical axis (6) and 
are fixable in a lower as well as in an upper position. 
A roof rack according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the support strips (4) are movable, after the 

releasing of a fixing element (adjusting screw 10) from 
a lower position near the roof surface to an upper 

position away from the roof surface, and the strips are 
rotatable when positioned in this upper position. 
A roof rack according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that there are provided elastic means (helical 

compression spring 17) for supporting the traslatory 
movement. 
A roof rack according to at least one of the claims 
1 to 3, characterised in that the elastic means (17) 

are disposed so as to act on the support strips (4) 
respectively towards the upper position.  

 
A roof rack according to at least one of the claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that the vertical axis (6) are 

respectively formed by a pin (7) and a axially and 
radially guided bushing (8), whereby the pins (7) are 

fixed at one end at the roof (1) and the bushing (8) 
are fixed at one end at the roof strips (4) and the 

pins (7) respectively are provided with a hole (13) 
with an inner thread, in which the threaded shaft (12) 

of a screw (10) which is supported with its head (11) 
on the corresponding support strip (4) is axially 

guided. 
A roof rack according to at least one of the claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that each pin (7) is formed 

with axially and radially extending link grooves (14, 
15), in which there are inserted guiding dents (16) 

which are disposed on the bushings(8). 
A roof rack according to at least one of the claims 
1 to 6, characterised in that each bushing (8) is 

provided with an annular flange formed by a frontal 
collar, and the compression spring (17) lies with one 

end on this flange and with the other end against the 
roof (1). 
A roof rack according to at least one of the claims 
1 to 7, characterised in that each pin (7) is directly 

fixed on the roof (1).  
 
A roof rack according to at least one of the claims 
1to 7, characterised in that the pins (7) are 

positioned on a respective link plug (9), which is 
fixed on the roof (1) and which supports a 

corresponding roof strip (2) which is positioned on the 
roof (1) and lodges a support strip (4). 
A roof rack according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the roof strips (2) are respectively provided with 

an open cavity (3) for lodging a respective support 
strip (4). 
A roof rack according to at least one of the claims 
1 to 7, characterised in that the pins (7) are 

respectively disposed on a link plug (9), which is 
fixed on the roof (1) and supports at the same time a 

support foot (19) which is positioned on the roof (1), 
whereby two support feet (19) support one support strip 

(4).
