<ABSTRACT>
Whereas conventional Ni/metal hydride button cells whose positive compressed-powder electrodes are produced from a mixture of Ni(OH)2, Ni powder and oxide compounds of cobalt suffer a massive irreversible capacity drop (curve 1) through an intensified high-temperature storage test at 65 DEG C, inserted in a cyclic treatment after n = 6 cycles, the same button cells exhibit a smaller and only temporary capacity decrease if from 0.1 to 15% of manganese and/or manganese oxide is also added to the positive bulk mixture (curve 2). The addition of manganese probably prevents reductive breakdown of a previously formed conductive CoOOH skeleton under the high-temperature storage conditions, by stabilising it or promoting its regeneration capacity.
