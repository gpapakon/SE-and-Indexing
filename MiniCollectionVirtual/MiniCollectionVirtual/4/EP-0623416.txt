<ABSTRACT>
A filler wire weld composition is set forth which 
provides high yield strength characteristics comparable to 

a base substrate made from a high performance Ni-Cr steel 
alloy. The filler wire weld composition is useful for 

repair welding substrate alloys used commercially in 
contexts such as turbine components such as rotors and 

discs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to welding filler wire
compositions. More specifically the present invention
relates to welding filler wire compositions which, in
welded form, provide for a weld having a high yield
strength.Advanced high performance alloy materials are used
in a variety of applications such as turbine components.
The alloy materials are frequently made from Ni-Cr alloys,
including alloys containing molybdenum and vanadium. These
alloys find uses as turbine rotors and discs in both gas
turbines and steam turbines. The turbine components are
characterized by having a high yield strength to withstand
the rigorous conditions during use. For instance, conventional
base alloy materials used in steam and combustion
turbine components have 0.2% yield strengths of from about
931-1069 (135 to about 155 ksi).Imperfections sometimes result in the manufacture
of the turbine components or result in the use of these
components under operating conditions. The components must
usually be replaced due to the unavailability of an adequate
filler weld wire material that can provide a weld
deposit having a comparable yield strength to that of the
base metal.Filler weld wire composition standards have been
set by various testing societies. The American Welding
Society has set forth various compositions in AWS A5.28
classes ER80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 that have 0.2% yield 
strengths of up to about 120 ksi. Commercially available
filler weld wire compositions, such as those available from
United States Welding Corporation contain from 0.09-0.11%
wt. C, 1.8-2.0% wt. Mn, 0.3-0.4% wt Si, 0.002-0.005% wt. S,
0.9-1.05% wt. Cr, 2.2-2.4% wt. Ni, 0.55-0.7% wt. Mo, less
than 0.005% wt. P, less than 0.01% wt. vanadium, and
residual levels of other elements. However, the highest
attainable 0.2% yield strengths with this material is up to
135 ksi.There exists a need to develop a filler weld wire
composition which has the strength characteristics
comparable to the high performance base alloy materials.
The filler wire composition should thus be able to provide
a weld that has a comparable 0.2% yield strength to the
base alloy while not compromising other physical
characteristics below acceptable levels.The present invention provides a filler wire
composition useful for providing a high strength repair
weld to the surface of a nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) alloy
material. The filler wire is preferably used to weld
turbine rotors and discs. The filler wire, after being
subjected to a postweld heat treatment process, provides a
weld
