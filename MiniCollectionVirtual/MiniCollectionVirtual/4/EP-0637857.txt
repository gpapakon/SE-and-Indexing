<ABSTRACT>
In a card edge connector, rotating pins are formed on the 
inner surfaces of the side walls of a box-shaped outer housing, 

while cylindrical bearings are formed on the outer surfaces of 
the side walls of inner housings in which electrically 

conductive terminals are accommodated. The inner housings are 
swingably held with the rotating pins engaged with the 

cylindrical bearings. The cylindrical bearings have cut-outs 
in the cylindrical walls which are opened in the direction of 

insertion, so that, as the inner housings are pushed into the 
outer housing, the rotating pins are engaged with the 

cylindrical bearings through the cut-outsa. The inner housings 
are urged by spring members in such a manner that the abutting 

parts of the terminals are moved away from terminals formed on 
the connecting end portion of a printed circuit board. When 

the connecting end portion of the printed circuit board starts 
to enter the outer housing is started, the connecting end 

portion gently touches the abutting parts of the terminals. 
When the connecting end portion is fully pushed into the outer 

housing, introducing cams, which are formed on a hood 
surrounding the connecting end portion, cause the inner 

housings to swing towards the connecting end portion, so that 
the terminals are positively pushed against the abutting parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a card edge connector having 
a plurality of metal terminals, the tongue pieces of which 
are pushed against a plurality of elongated terminals which 
are formed on both sides of the connecting end portion of a 
printed circuit board, so that the terminals of the card 
edge connector are electrically connected to the terminals 
of the printed circuit board. A card edge connector is engaged with a printed circuit 
board in such a manner that it holds an edge portion of the 
printed circuit board, namely, a connecting end portion. 
The connecting end portion is designed as follows: at a 
predetermined edge portion of the printed circuit board, 
parts of the printed lines are formed into elongated terminals 
which are arranged side by side on both sides of the 
edge portion. A conventional card edge connector of this 
type is as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. A publication showing a 
conventional card edge connector of this type is e.g. DE-A-1 
640 392. Terminals (not shown) are formed on both sides of an 
end portion 1 of a printed circuit board. On the other 
hand, the card edge connector 2 has a box-shaped housing 3 
having a slit-shaped inserting hole 4 into which the connecting 
end portion 1 is inserted. The housing 3 holds 
metal terminals 5 in such a manner that the metal terminals 
define a narrow space which is extended from the inserting 
hole 4 to the back. Each of the terminals 5 has a 
tongue-shaped abutting part 6 which is flexible and protrudes 
towards the narrow space. The card edge connector 2 is engaged with the connecting 
end portion 1 of the printed circuit board as follows: 
first, the edge of the connecting end portion 1 is set in 
the inserting hole 4 of the housing 3, and then the connecting 
end portion 1 is pushed into the inserting hole 4. 
In this operation, the connecting end portion 1 is moved  
 
towards the back while pushing the tongue-shaped abutting 
parts 6 away from each other which are protruded into the 
space from both sides which is located behind the inserting 
hole 4. When the connecting end portion 1 is inserted into the 
card edge connector, it is obliquely abutted against the 
abutting parts 6, so that it deflects the abutting parts 6 
while sliding on the latter. However, when the abutting 
parts 6 are pushed away from each other by the connecting 
end portion 1, the resistance against the pushing operation 
is relatively large. Hence, the connecting end portion 1 
does not smoothly slide on the abutting parts 6 depending 
on the way of
