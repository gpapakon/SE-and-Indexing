<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic
elements containing specific indoaniline cyan dyes.Modern color negative films usually contain
dyes coated in one or more layers for a variety of
purposes. In addition to being utilized for spectral
sensitization, dyes may be used for filtering specific
wavelengths of exposing light (either as intergrain
absorbers or in separate layers containing no silver
halide), for antihalation and to adjust the background
density (Dmin) of color negative films for printing
purposes. Such preformed coated dyes (that is, dyes
which are present in the element prior to exposure and
development) are often referred to as "dummy dyes" to
distinguish them from dyes that may be formed
photographically as a result of exposure and
chromogenic development.In the development of color photographic
elements, bleach solutions are used to oxidize
developed silver to silver ions for subsequent removal
in fix solution by formation of soluble silver
complexes. The bleach and fix solutions are sometimes
combined into a single "blix" solution. Bleach
solutions commonly contain complexes of ferric ion,
such as ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
as oxidizing agents. Prolonged use of such solutions
for processing of photographic film can result in
accumulation of substantial quantities of the
corresponding ferrous ion complexes (such as ferrous 
EDTA), which can function as reducing agents. These
reducing agents can cause reductive discoloration of
dummy dyes (so called leuco dye formation). The
formation of leuco dye in such seasoned bleaches is
undesirable, not only because the resulting Dmin
density provided by the dummy dye will be less than the
optimum required for proper printing characteristics,
but also because variabilities in Dmin can occur as
seasoning of a bleach progresses.Many cyan dyes that have been used in color
negative films for antihalation and for Dmin adjustment
have suffered from a number of deficiencies, including
loss of color in seasoned photographic bleach solutions
or in bleaches of low oxidizing strength.
Additionally, they may also have improper hue or suffer
from changes in hue and/or density upon storage at low
or high temperatures. For example, the dye of
structure C1 has been used extensively in a number of
commercial color negative films. The hue of this dye
is suitable for Dmin adjustment and for antihalation
purposes. However, dye C1 can undergo reductive
discoloration when films containing it are processed in
seasoned photographic bleaches or in
