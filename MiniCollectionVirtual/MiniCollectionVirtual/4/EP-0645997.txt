<ABSTRACT>
A cosmetic is disclosed for aiding the transport of oxygen in the skin, as well as a process for preparing the same and its use. The problem with known cosmetics is the insufficient oxygen supply to the skin and adjacent tissues. The object of the invention provides a means to go beyond the stratum corneum of the skin and the epiderm by penetration processes in order to increase the oxygen concentration in the corial zone and adjacent tissues and to activate the metabolic processes. For that purpose, a cosmetic with asymmetrical lamellary aggregates consists of phospholipids and an oxygen-loaded fluorocarbon compound or a fluorocarbon compound mixture. The proportion of fluorocarbon compound lies in a range from 0.2 to 100 % by weight/volume, and it is contained in an excipient appropriate for dermatological uses. This cosmetic is prepared by emulsifying its components and is used in salves, creams, lotions, liquids, alcoholic extracts, pastes, powders, gels, tinctures on or plasters and bandages, or in a spray.

<CLAIMS>
Phospholipid- and fluorcarbon-containing cosmetic, 
characterised by 


(i) a carrier suitable for cosmetic use; 
(ii) asymmetric lamellar aggregates, consisting of phospholipids 
with a content of phosphatidylcholine in the range 

from 30 to 99 % by weigth and oxygen-laden fluorocarbons, 
the amount of fluorocarbons being in the range from 0.2 to 

100 % weight/volume; 
 
the penetration into the skin being controlled by means of 

the critical solubility temperature of the selected fluorocarbons 
or mixture of fluorcarbons. 
Cosmetic according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the lamellar aggregates have an asymmetric, preferably 

3-layer structure, originating from their fluorocarbon core. 
Cosmetic according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the fluorocarbons are selected from the group which 

consists of aliphatic straight-chain and branched fluoroalkanes, 
mono- or bicyclic, optionally fluoroalkyl-substituted, 

fluorocycloalkanes, perfluorinated aliphatic or 
bicyclic amines, bis(perfluoroalkyl)ethenes, perfluoropolyethers 

and mixtures thereof. 
Cosmetic according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the fluorocarbons are selected from the group which consists 

of perfluorodecalin, F-butyltetrahydrofuran, perfluorotributylamine, 
perfluorooctyl bromide, bis-fluoro(butyl)ethene 

and C₆-C₉-perfluoroalkanes. 
Cosmetic according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the amount of fluorocarbons is in the 

range from 20 to 100 % weight/volume, preferably in the 
range from 40 to 100 %, in particular in the range from 70  

 
to 100 %. 
Cosmetic according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the phospholipids are selected from 

the group consisting of natural phospholipids such as soya 
lecithin and egg lecithin and also synthetic phospholipids 

and/or partially hydrogenated phospholipids. 
Cosmetic according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the lipid fraction used contains 

phosphatidylcholine in an amount from 70 to 99 %. 
Cosmetic according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that, in addition to phosphatidylcholine, 

lysolecithins are present in the concentration range from 1 
to 10 % by weight. 
Cosmetic according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that, for reaching a slowly skin penetration, 

it contains fluorcarbons or mixtures of fluorcarbons 
with a higher critical solubility temperature. 
Process for the preparation of a phospholipid-containing 
cosmetic, characterised in that phospholipids 

with a content of phosphatidylcholine in the range from 30 
to 99 % by weigth together with an oxygen-laden fluorocarbon 

or fluorocarbon mixture are incorporated after a pre-emulsification 
at realtively high speed of rotation and a 

subsequent high-pressure emulsification into a carrier 
suitable for cosmetic use and non-interacting with the 

asymmetric lamellar aggregates, the amount of fluorocarbon 
being in the range from 0.2 to 100 % weight/volume, and the 

asymmetric lamellar aggregates having a particle size from 
50 to 3000 nm, in particular 50 to 1000 nm. 
Process according to Claim 10, characterised in 
that the fluorocarbons are selected from the group which 

consists of aliphatic straight-chain and branched fluoroalkanes, 
mono- or bicyclic, optionally fluoroalkyl- substituted,

cosmetic is in the range from 0.9 to 15 % by weight, in 
particular in the range from 2 to 9 %. 
Use of a phospholipid-containing cosmetic for

in the range from 0.2 to 100 % weight/volume, the
