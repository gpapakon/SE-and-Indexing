A steam generating plant, comprising: 

a) a steam turbine (26, 28) driving a generator (2); 
b) a steam bleeder line (52, 58) connected to the steam turbine and having a 
load-dependently adjustable valve (54, 60); 
c) a system (4) comprising a superconducting magnetic energy accumulator (62) 
which is electrically connected in parallel with the generator (2); and 
d) a control unit (72), 
 
wherein, in order to level out a power deficit of seconds duration occurring in a 

network (68) connected to the generator (2), by means of the control unit (72) 
electrical power can be furnished directly from the superconducting energy 

accumulator (62) and wherein at the same time the valve (54, 60) can be adjusted by 
means of the control unit (72) to make more steam available to the steam turbine (26, 

28). 
A steam generating plant according to claim 1, characterised in that the control 
unit (72) is designed so that, immediately after compensation for the power deficit, the 

electrical energy made available from the generator (2) as a result of the increased 
amount of steam made available can be fed into the energy accumulator (62). 
A steam generating plant according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that 
the superconducting magnetic energy storage system (4) includes a superconducting 

magnet coil (62) which is connected to the electrical network (68) via a network-dependently 
regulated converter (66) and a transformer (70). 
A steam generating plant according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
superconducting magnetic energy storage system (4) includes the control unit (72) 

which adjusts the converter (66) as a function of the load in the electrical network (68)

valleys in the network.  
 
A steam generating plant according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the valve (54, 60) in the bleeder steam line (52, 58) is closable as a function of

includes a metallic superconducting material, e.g. a niobium-titanium alloy, and is 
connected via a line made of a high temperature superconducting material to an 

onward-leading line made of a normally-conducting material. 
A steam generating plant according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the superconducting magnetic energy storage system (4) is disposed 

independently of the generating plant (1) at a node of the electrical network (68) and 
that the valve (54, 60) in the bleeder steam line of the generating plant (1) is remotely 

controllable by the control unit (72) of the system (4). 
A steam generating plant according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the superconducting magnetic energy storage system (4) is disposed 

independently of the generating plant (1) at a node of the electrical network (68) and 
that the valve (54, 60) in the bleeder steam line of the generating plant (1) is 

adjustable by means of a control unit of its own in the generating plant (1). 
A method for operating a steam generating plant comprising a steam turbine 
(26, 28) driving a generator (2) electrically connected to an electrical network, in 

particular according to one of claims 1 to 8,
 
characterised in that
 
a power deficit of seconds duration occurring in the electrical network (68) is levelled 

out by means of a control unit (72) operating in a network-dependent manner, i.e. as 
a function of a power deficit detectable in the electrical network (68), by directly 

furnishing energy stored in a superconducting magnetic energy accumulator (62), and 
that by means of the control unit (72) a valve (54, 60) in a bleeder steam line (52, 58) 

is adjusted to make more steam available to the steam turbine (26, 28).  
 
A method according to claim 9, characterised in that when the load in the 
network decreases the valve (54, 60) in the bleeder steam line (52, 58) is adjusted to 

withdraw steam and the superconducting magnetic energy accumulator (62) is 
charged by means of a network-dependently regulated converter (66). 
A method according to claim 9 or claim 10, characterised in that the
