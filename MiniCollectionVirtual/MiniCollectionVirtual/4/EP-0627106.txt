<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic identification 
device and a method in such a device. By means of said 
identification device it is possible to detect presence of 
objects in an interrogation zone and also the identity of 
said objects. The detection is made contactless. For a long time so called transponders functioning as 
electronic identification devices have been used in a 
variety of areas. Such a transponder comprises some type of 
means that is affected by an external signal to transmit or 
respond with another signal. Said external signal is 
generated by a transmitter means transmitting said signal 
within a specific area, a so called interrogation zone. 
Normally the reply signal includes such information that 
the transmitter means or a receiver means operatively 
connected thereto will be informed that the transponder is 
present in the interrogation zone. The information may 
exist in form of a specific reply frequency from an 
oscillator circuit on said transponder or by such influence 
of the external signal that the transmitter means can 
identify the transponder. In agriculture this type of transponder has been 
used to identify specific animals in a group of animals. In 
these applications the transponder is attached to some part 
of the body of the animal, for instance the ear, and the 
response signal from the transponder is used for instance 
for portion out food and for administrating drugs. There 
are also transponders, the reply signal thereof including 
besides the identification signal also information about 
for instance the body temperature of the animal. Latter developments of microtechniques have made 
possible further developed transponders including an 
arithmetic unit and a memory unit having a considerable  
 
calculating and memory capacity. In such embodiments the 
reply signal can be far more complex and comprise large 
amounts of information taken for instance from said memory 
unit. It is possible also to transmit to said transponder 
information to be stored in the memory unit thereof. A 
transponder of this type is disclosed in WO91/17515. Normally a transponder is formed so that the reply 
signal thereof differs from the reply signal of other 
transponders. One of the most common applications for 
transponders is exactly to identify which bodies or which 
objects that carry the transponder. Identical objects 
normally carry identical transponders, that is transponders 
that are adjusted to transmit the same reply signal. In 
such cases problems arise if
