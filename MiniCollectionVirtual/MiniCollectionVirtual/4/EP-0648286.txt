<ABSTRACT>
When manufacturing mineral fiber products with compressed surface areas made of mineral fiber webs, in which the fibers extend substantially parallel, perpendicular or obliquely to the large surfaces of the mineral fiber web, which contains an uncured binder, it is very important to achieve a high tearing resistance and a strong fiber connection between the compressed surface areas or layers and the remaining part of the mineral fiber web. It is therefore proposed to expose at least one surface area to needling down to a predetermined penetration depth, in order to felt the fibers and at the same time to compress the surface area.

Method for producing mineral fiber products having compacted
surface portions, in which method an endless mineral fiber web is

continuosly moved, wherein the fibers within the mineral fiber
web, by virtue of a preceding operation, extend substantially parallel

to the large surfaces of the mineral fiber web, and wherein
said web contains a non-cured bonding agent which is cured by a

thermal treatment, 
characterized in that
 at least one surface portion
of said endless and continuously moved mineral fiber web

with an unchanged orientation of the fibers after a first mechanical
precompaction is subject to needle impacts up to a predetermined

penetration depth, so that the fibers felt and at the same
time the surface portion is compacted.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the frequency
of stroke of the needle impacts is variable and adjustable.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the stroke
and the penetration depth of the needles are variable and adjustable.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 said mineral fiber web is advanced under a second
compaction to the thermal treatment.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 the needle impacts for the compaction and felting are
uniformly distributed in the entire surface portion.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 the treatment by needle impacts takes place on both
of the mutually parallel surface portions of the mineral fiber web. 
Method according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the mineral
fiber web, after curing of the bonding agent, is cut open in a cutting

plane parallel to the large surfaces so as to produce two mineral
fiber slabs having a unilaterally compacted layer.
Method according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
that
 the needle impacts are effected by rows in the longitudinal
and/or transverse directions of the mineral fiber web so that the

finished product slabs are flexible or can be polygonally buckled.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 the treatment is effected using different types or

shapes of needles.
Method according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 a compaction
and felting of the surface portion is effected by means of short

preliminary needles and that by means of subsequent needles of
greater length part of the fibers from the outer compacted surface

portion are pushed into the inner non-compacted portion of the
mineral fiber web.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 the thickness of the compacted layer in the surface
portion is determined by selecting the penetration depth of the

needles, by the frequency of stroke and by the needle shape so
that small penetration depths, high frequencies of stroke and

needles having a large effective cross section, on one hand, result
in thin and highly compacted layers, while great penetration

depths, low frequencies of stroke and needles having a small
cross section, on the other hand, result in less compacted layers. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 additional additives are charged by means of hollow
needles for additional reinforcement of the surface portion.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 a thin fleece of a fiber material, particularly glass fibers,
is laid onto the surface of the mineral fiber web and thereafter

the needle impacting operation is carried out so that part of
the fibers of the fleece are embedded in the mineral fiber web.
Method according to any one of the claims 1 to 12, 
characterized
in that
 a tissue is laid onto the surface of the mineral fiber web
and thereafter the needle impacting operation is carried out so

that part of the tissue is embedded in the mineral fiber web.
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein a plurality of needles (13,14) are connected

in groups or in common to a lifting means (15,16) which is
arranged at least on one surface side of the mineral fiber web

(10,17) and is equipped with a driving means, 
characterized in
that
 the needles penetrate into the mineral fiber web (10,17) in a
clocked manner and up to a predetermined penetration depth,

thereby felting and simultaneously compacting said web in the
surface portion.
Apparatus according to claim 15, 
characterized in that
 the stroke
of the lifting means (15,16) is adjustable and variable and that the

frequency of stroke can be regulated via the driving means.
Apparatus according to claim 15 or 16, 
characterized in that

impact forces of the needles (13,14) can be regulated.
Apparatus according to any one of the claims 15 to 17, 
characterized

 the needles (13,14) and particularly those serving 
for the pre-compaction have a head (27,30) which is enlarged

Apparatus according to claim 19, 
characterized in that
 at least
one protruding pinpoint (31) is provided on the chisel head

(27,30).
Apparatus according to any one of the claims 15 to 19, 
characterized

needles and are connected to supplying means for additives, preferably

liquid additives.
Apparatus according to any one of the claims 15 to 20, 
characterized
in that
 the needles are fixed to a plate-like carrier (11,12)
which is connected to the lifting means and to the driving means.
Apparatus according to claim 21, 
characterized in that
