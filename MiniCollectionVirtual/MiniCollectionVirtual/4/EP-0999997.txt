<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for decoloring
liquids, in particular ground water. The present invention furthermore
relates to the use of an oxidation reactor for decoloring liquids, in particular ground water,
by using such a method, as well as to decolored ground water which has
been obtained by using the method according to the present invention.In practice a number of processes for decoloring ground
water exist, namely adsorption on active carbon and membrane filtration.
The process of adsorption on active carbon comprises a bed of active
carbon, through which the water to be decolored is passed with a residence
time of about 10 - 30 minutes, after which a product flow is obtained from
which the colour has been removed. One drawback of such a process is the
fact that in practice the filter bed of active carbon is already saturated
within a month. The saturated active carbon must then be removed from the
filter bed and be returned to the supplier, where the saturated bed
material is regenerated by means of steam into active carbon, which can
be reused in the filter bed. Since the application of such necessary
regeneration operations interferes with a continuous operation, it is usual
in practice to connect a number of filter beds in series, so that a
continuous operation is ensured. Another drawback of decoloring ground
water by using active carbon is the fact that the ground water generally
contains certain organic substances which, if they bond to active carbon,
form an ideal seed-bed for bacteria and higher organisms, for example
worms. As a result of this luxuriant growth, especially the bacteriological
quality of the ground water leaving the filter bed of active carbon will
decrease. In addition, the presence of said higher organisms in the
distribution network may lead to problems.Another process for decoloring ground water consists
of membrane filtration. The advantage of such membrane filtration on a
nano filtration scale (pore size: 0.01 - 0.001 micron) is the fact that
in addition to the removal of the colour, also substances such as iron
and manganese can be removed. One drawback of such membrane filtration
is the high energy consumption, namely about 0.5 kWh per m3 of purified
water. Another major drawback is the fact that 10 - 20% of the ground water 
to be decolored leaves the process in the form of a waste flow (concentrate
flow). In connection with the possible scarcity of ground in the future
it is desirable, therefore, not to waste any ground water.The object of the
