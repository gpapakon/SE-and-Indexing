<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum cleaner (10) with a housing (12), a 
source of vacuum (16,18), and an air chamber (20) located in 

the housing and connected to the source of vacuum. The 
housing includes a bottom member (26), a top member (28) and 

a handle (30) contacting and extending from a top surface of 
the top member (28). The handle (30) is separately 

connected (62,63,65) to the bottom member (26) such that the 
handle (30) is supported by both the top and bottom members. 

The air chamber (20) is located in the housing (12) between 
the top and bottom members with an inlet aperture (30) and 

an exhaust aperture (88) located at the exterior of the 
housing. The air chamber (20) is comprised of two half 

sections (76,78) that combine to form an inlet conduit (82), 
an outlet conduit (86), and an impeller chamber (84). An 

impeller (18) of the source of vacuum is located in the 
impeller chamber (84). The source of vacuum has a motor 

(16) with a first end connected to the impeller and a second 
end forming a drive shaft (17) to drive a belt (66) 

connected to a rotatable brush assembly (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vacuum cleaners 
and, more particularly, to a new housing and airflow conduit 
system through the housing. U.S. Patent 2,054,975 discloses a hand-held vacuum 
cleaner having an annular shutter to manipulate the 
direction of dirty air. An inlet and outlet are located 
near each other at the rear of the unit. U.S. Patent 
2,491,007 discloses a hand-held vacuum cleaner with a two 
part casing, a motor having a pulley at one end to a drive 
roller, and a fan at an opposite end. U.S. Patent 1,944,950 
discloses a convertible suction cleaner that can convert 
from a floor to a hand-held unit. The inlet and outlet 
nozzles are located near each other and perpendicular to the 
axis of the fan. U.S. Patents 4,811,450 and 4,660,246 
disclose fan casings with an outer wall that can be adapted 
for a hose connection having a vertical intake nozzle. U.S. 
Patent 3,273,194 discloses a casing with a forward section 
and a channel shaped member that define a housing for an air 
impeller with a cover. The present invention provides a vacuum cleaner 
comprising a housing and a source of vacuum located in the 
housing, the source of vacuum including a motor and an 
impeller characterised in that the vacuum cleaner comprises 
an air chamber connected to the housing and surrounding the 
impeller, the air chamber being comprised of at least two 
half sections that form an inlet conduit, an impeller 
chamber, and an outlet conduit, the inlet conduit having a 
substantially constant cross-sectional area along its 
length. The present invention provides a vacuum cleaner 
comprising a housing a motor connected to the housing, the 
motor having a first end with a vacuum impeller connected 
thereto and an opposite second end forming a drive shaft, a 
rotatable brush assembly connected to the housing, a drive 
belt connecting the rotatable brush assembly to the drive  
 
shaft of the motor characterised by an air chamber connected 
to the housing and surrounding the vacuum impeller, the air 
chamber having an inlet aperture and an exhaust aperture 
located at the exterior of the housing. The present invention further provides a vacuum 
cleaner housing comprising: a first member, a second member 
connected to the first member, the first and second members 
forming a general chamber therebetween characterised by a 
handle extending from and contacting an exterior surface of 
the second member, the handle being separately attached to 
the first member through the general chamber such that the 
handle
