<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatuses and a method for 
the rotary draw bending of rigid tubes, such as those of use 
in automotive exhaust systems, heat exchangers and aircraft 
hydraulic systems. In prior apparatus used for the rotary draw bending 
of pipe and tube, such as of use in automobile exhaust 
systems, heat exchangers and aircraft construction, a primary 
component is the bending head of the apparatus. The bending 
head comprises a rotary bend die, an opposing clamp die which 
clamps a section of the tube immediately preceding the 
section of the tube where the bend is to be formed, and a 
pressure die located directly behind the clamped section of 
the tube. As the tube is pulled around the rotary bend die, 
the pressure die moves substantially in unison with the tube 
while resisting the radial reaction force of the tube acting 
on the pressure die. Thus, the pressure die and rotary bend 
die cause the tube to be squeezed therebetween during the 
bending operation. Many variable factors, such as the type of tube 
material, tube wall thickness, shape of the tube section to 
be formed, the radius of the bend and the like, need to be 
considered when tube bending with rotary draw bending 
machinery is carried out. However, although commercially 
acceptable tubes are manufactured with apparatus hereinbefore 
described, there is a need for pipe bending methods and 
apparatus which are capable of producing tubes of a 
consistent, desired quality. While not being bound by 
theory, applicant believes that although the tube and 
pressure die move substantially in unison, slight changes in  
 
the values of the above variables in consequence of changes 
in pipe diameter, wall thickness, the presence of impurities 
and the like, during the bending operation may cause small, 
but significant changes in the speed of the pressure die 
relative to that of the tube. Thus, by exerting a negative 
boost or slowing force to the tube by means of applying a 
force to the pressure die, the forward motion of the tube is 
restrained. Alternatively, by exerting a positive boost or 
quickening force to the pressure die during the bending 
operation the frictional force enhances forward movement of 
the outer tube. Thus, by monitoring the speed of the 
pressure die and the perpendicular force exerted on the tube 
and compensating for the effects of changes in the above 
parameters, an improved tube product can consistently be 
manufactured. Further, in addition by monitoring the force 
required to achieve the
