<ABSTRACT>
Workpieces of aluminum alloy are resistance-welded 
while a powdery mixture (1) of magnesium and a metal oxide is being 

interposed between regions of workpieces (2,4) of aluminum alloy 
which are to be joined to each other. The metal oxide 

may comprise at least one material selected from the group 
consisting of TiO₂, SiO₂, Cr₂O₃, MnO₂, Fe₂O₃, CuO, and Ti₂O₃ 

and the powdery mixture may include aluminum powder. The 
workpieces may be made of aluminum, stainless steel, or the 

like rather than aluminum alloy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of resistance-welding 
workpieces of metal, especially workpieces of 
aluminum alloy. Aluminum alloys (including aluminum) are widely 
used as components in aircraft, vehicles, etc. as they are 
highly resistant to corrosion and have good machinability. 
If workpieces of aluminum alloy are to be spot-welded, a 
large electric current needs to be supplied to the workpieces 
of aluminum alloy in a short period of time because the aluminum 
alloy has small electric resistance and large thermal 
conductivity. When a large electric current is supplied to 
the workpieces of aluminum alloy, however, electrode tips 
tend to be fused with the workpieces of aluminum alloy. It has been proposed to interpose a thin film of 
zinc between workpieces of aluminum alloy as disclosed in 
Japanese patent publication No. 54-41550. According to this 
publication, the thin film of zinc is interposed between regions 
of aluminum plates which are to be resistance-welded, 
and then instantaneously melted in a resistance welding process 
to produce a high-resistance area to concentrate electric 
energy thereon. Japanese patent publication No. 59-26392 discloses 
a thin layer of titanium, rather than a thin film of zinc, to 
be interposed between aluminum workpieces to be welded, and 
Japanese patent publication No. 59-26393 discloses a thin 
sheet of stainless steel, rather than a thin film of zinc, to 
be interposed between aluminum workpieces to be welded. 
Placing an aluminum alloy having a higher electric resistance 
than workpieces of aluminum which are to be welded between 
those workpieces is disclosed in Japanese laid-open patent 
publication No. 63-278679. The thin film of zinc, the thin layer of titanium,  
 
the thin sheet of stainless steel, and the high-electric-resistance 
aluminum alloy are effective to increase the electric 
resistance of a local area of the aluminum workpieces, 
but are ineffective to lower the electric current that is 
necessary to be supplied to the aluminum workpieces because 
all the heat required to weld the aluminum workpieces is generated 
as Joule heat. Among various demands in recent years is to increase 
a welded area with a constant electric current supplied 
to workpieces that are to be resistance-welded. 
However, such a demand cannot be met by the above conventional 
welding processes because they need an increased electric 
current to be supplied to produce an increased welded 
area. Resistance-welding of workpieces made of aluminum,
