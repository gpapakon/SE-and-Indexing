<ABSTRACT>
A thermal-insulation element (1) with mutually parallel wall surfaces (2) and supporting means (12) arranged therebetween is provided with termination means (3, 7) in the border region, the space between the wall surfaces (2) being largely evacuated. In order to achieve a thermally good-quality termination in the border region, provision is made for a diaphragm (3) which is set back at least with respect to a border (5) of the wall surface (2) and is protected by a diaphragm covering (7), the diaphragm, just as the diaphragm covering, consisting of a material which is a poor heat conductor.

Refrigeration and/or freezing appliance having a vacuum insulating
moulded body for the top, door or housing, with mutually parallel wall faces

and support means disposed therebetween and having sealing means
provided in the edge region between the wall faces, the sealing means

having a vacuum-tight membrane (3) which is set back relative to at least
one edge (5) of the wall faces (2) and which joins in a sealing-tight manner

the adjacent edges (5) of the wall faces (2) and having a membrane
covering (7), the membrane bridging the free outer edges (6) of the wall

faces. and the membrane (3) and the membrane covering (7) consisting of
materials which are poor conductors of heat.

that the membrane (3) is formed with corrugations (3.1) extending parallel

to the plane of the wall faces (2).
Refrigeration or freezing appliance according to claim 1 or 2. characterised
in that the end edges of the membrane (3) are oriented towards the free

edges (6) of the wall faces (2) and are connected to the same in a vacuum-tight
manner at the mutually facing inner faces (4).
Refrigeration or freezing appliance according to claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims. characterised in that the membrane covering (7)

overlaps the associated front edges (5) of the wall faces (2).

subsequent claims, characterised in that the membrane covering (7)

engages between the free edges (5) of the wall faces (2). 
Refrigeration or freezing appliance according to claim 5, characterised in
that the membrane covering (7) ends with clearance from the membrane

(3).
Refrigeration or freezing appliance according to claim 5, characterised in
that the membrane covering (7) abuts the membrane (3) in a flush manner.
Refrigeration or freezing appliance according to claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterised in that the membrane covering (7)

consists of heat-insulating material, in particular plastics foam.
Refrigeration or freezing appliance according to claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterised in that the membrane covering (7)

overlaps the associated edge regions (6) of the wall faces (2) on their
exterior.

subsequent claims, characterised in that the mutually opposing free edge

regions (6) of the wall faces (2) are inclined towards one another and are
in abutment with holding faces engaging between these edge regions (6)

on the membrane covering (7).
Refrigeration or freezing appliance according to claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterised in that the membrane covering (7) in a

refrigeration or freezing appliance is provided with a magnetic counter-pole
