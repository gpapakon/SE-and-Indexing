<ABSTRACT>
A pipeline moulding for waste-gas systems for condensing boilers exhibits a basic pipe body (1) which, at its outlet end, has a pipe-connection socket (2) and, at its other end and in its side wall, has in each case one connection opening (4, 5). On the two connection openings (4, 5), the basic pipe body (1) is provided in each case with an external thread (6). A socket connection stub (7) can be connected, by means of a threaded ring (8), to one of the two connection openings (4, 5). A closure piece (9, 9', 11) can be screwed onto the respectively other connection opening (5, 4). The closure piece is, for example, a closed cap (9).

<CLAIMS>
Pipe fitting for flue systems for condensing value unit, having a pipe body (1),
which at its outlet end has a pipe connecting sleeve (2) and at its other end, as well as

in its side wall, a connection hole (4, 5), in each case, characterised in that the pipe
body (1) has an external thread (6) at each of the two connection holes (4, 5), that a

sleeve connection piece (7) can be connected to either of the two connection holes (4,
5) by means of a threaded ring (8), that a cover (9, 9', 11) can be screwed onto the

other respective connection hole (5, 4) and that the axis (5a) of the connection hole (5)
along the side wall ofthe pipe body (1) forms an angle (a) of more than 90°,

preferably about 93°, with the longitudinal axis (1a) of said pipe body towards the
outlet end.

Pipe fitting according to claim 1, characterised in that the cover is a lid (9') having
a measuring aperture sealed by means of a screw plug (10').
Pipe fitting according to claim 1, characterised in that the cover has a pipe
connection sleeve (11) provided with a threaded ring (12) to connect a condensate

drain.
Pipe fitting according to claim 1, characterised in that the pipe body (1) has a side
measuring aperture sealed by means of a screw plug (10).
