<ABSTRACT>
A fuel system for a single-cylinder internal combustion gas engine comprising a constant gas pressure governor (90) that is situated in a gas supply line (108, 112) extending to the throat of a venturi carburetor, the gas pressure governor (90) including a diaphragm-operated gas valve that responds to changes in static pressure on the upstream side of the venturi of the carburetor, the governor (90) being adapted to compensate for changes in venturi throat pressure due to the opening and the closing of the intake valve for the single-cylinder engine, whereby the governor (90) tends to maintain a uniform air/fuel ratio throughout a large engine speed range.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to internal 
combustion engines adapted to be used with a 
residential heat pump. It relates particularly to a 
gas fuel carburetor assembly according to claim 1. The improvements of this invention relate to 
natural gas engines, particularly to single-cylinder 
natural gas engine with a four-stroke cycle. It 
relates generally to the fuel supply system discosed 
in United States Patent No. 4,886,034, which discloses 
a four-stroke cycle, single-cylinder engine for a 
residential heat pump wherein the fuel supply manifold 
communicates with a venturi carburetor having a 
venturi element and an air bypass passage, the latter 
being controlled by a throttle valve that is distinct 
from the speed control throttle valve located in a 
fuel supply manifold on the downstream side of both  
 
the venturi element and the bypass passage. The 
throttle valve and the bypass passage of the device of 
the '034 patent compensate for normal tendencies of 
the air/fuel ratio to vary in magnitude as the engine 
speed changes. They may be used also as an enrichment 
mechanism to facilitate engine starting. Fuel is supplied to the throat of the 
carburetor of the '034 patent by a means of a supply 
passage defined in part by a gas pressure governor 
that includes a diaphragm valve having a diaphragm 
that is actuated in response to the pressure 
differential between the throat of the carburetor 
venturi and the pressure at the air intake of the 
carburetor. An attempt is made in the control of the 
'034 patent to maintain a high operating efficiency 
for the engine by using a pre-programmed 
microprocessor that responds to sensed engine speed 
and manifold pressure changes to control the throttle 
valve and the bypass passage around the carburetor 
venturi. Pressure pulsations that are due to the 
opening and the closing of the intake valve for the 
single cylinder can be offset by appropriately 
calibrating the microprocessor to compensate for the 
pulsating pressure of the air that flows through the 
carburetor throat. Compensating adjustments in the 
bypass throttle valve are made in response to output 
signals developed by the microprocessor as the 
microprocessor responds to the instantaneous data that 
is measured by the manifold pressure sensor and the 
engine speed sensor. Gas governor valves for gas engines are used 
in other environments such as the auxiliary gas valve 
system for a diesel engine described in United States 
Patent No. 3,540,419. The engine described in the  
 
'419
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A gas fuel carburetor assembly for an internal 
combustion gas engine with one or two cylinders (10) 

comprising an air induction passage (86, 88) and a fuel 
supply passage (108, 112); 


a gas pressure governor means (90) for regulating 
the supply pressure for said fuel supply passage (108, 

112); 
said governor (90) having a gas chamber (94) and 
an air reference pressure chamber (96), said fuel 

supply passage (108, 112) communicating with said gas 
chamber (94); 
a venturi member (62) in said induction passage 
(86, 88), gas ports (64) in said venturi member (62) 

communicating with a throat portion of said venturi 
member (62), a calibrated gas passage means (46) having 

a minimal flow restriction for connecting said gas 
chamber (94) with said gas ports (64); 
a gas valve member (106) registering with said 
fuel supply passage (108), spring means (104) for 

normally urging said gas valve member (106) to a gas 
supply passage means closing position; 
a flexible diaphragm (98) separating said 
reference pressure chamber (96) and said gas chamber 

(94); 
a gas valve operator element (100) connecting said 
valve member (106) and said diaphragm (98); and 
a balance line (110) connecting said reference 
pressure chamber (96) and said induction passage (86) 

on the upstream side of said venturi member (62); 
characterised in that
 said induction passage (86) 
and said reference pressure chamber (96) are in close, 

unrestricted flow relationship whereby transient 
pressure changes in said induction passage (86) develop  

 
an immediate response by said governor (90) to maintain 

a desired target air/fuel ratio for a wide range of 
engine speeds and loads, said balance line (110) having 

a diameter and length relationship such that d²/L≥ 1.016 mm (.04 
inches) where d = balance line internal diameter and L = 

length from said induction passage (86) to said 
reference air pressure chamber (96). 
A carburetor assembly as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said gas passage means (46) is defined in part 

by a gas flow controlling orifice valve means (48) for 
determining the rate of delivery of gas to said venturi 

member (62). 
A carburetor assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2, wherein said spring means (104) acts on said 

gas valve (106) with a force not in excess of the force 
necessary to balance gas and air pressure forces in 

said diaphragm (98).
