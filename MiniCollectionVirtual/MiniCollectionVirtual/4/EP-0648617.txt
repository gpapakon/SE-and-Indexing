<ABSTRACT>
A clamp (10), particularly suitable for tidily 
restraining a set of sheets, documents and the like, 

appropriately grouped together in a form suitable for 
easy consultation thereof, preventing individual 

sheets from falling out or becoming lost. The clamp 
(10) comprises two clamping jaws (11, 12) 

longitudinally extending and provided on one side 
with opposite clamping edges (17, 18) for gripping 

the set of sheets to be clamped; the two jaws (11, 
12) are hinged at one of their ends and are provided 

with a snap-engaging device (14) which can be 
manually disengaged to allow the insertion or removal 

of the sheets. The clamp (10) is particularly 
suitable for gripping a set of individual paper 

sheets, magazines, newspapers or for other similar 
applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet clamp 
intended to be applied along a lateral edge of a set 
of sheet, documents, a newspaper, magazine or the 
like to maintain them in a tidy form and suitable for 
consultation thereof, preventing individual sheets or 
individual pages from becoming lost or falling out 
untidily. As is known, in many cases the need arises for 
displaying or making available to the public a 
certain number of documents which must be kept and 
maintained in an ordered form to facilitate or allow 
reading or consultation thereof. For example in many places open to the public it is 
customary to display newspapers, magazines or the 
like, arranging them on a table or on a shelf, 
leaving the reader, having finished consultation, to 
replace the newspaper or magazine tidily on the same 
table or on the shelf from which it had been taken. 
In the case of newspapers, or more generally in the 
case of a set of document sheets where the individual  
 
pages or the individual sheets are not attached one 
to the other, there is the risk of individual sheets 
falling out, becoming lost or spoilt, thus making 
consultation thereof difficult. Presently some remedies are used which do not allow 
to mantain documents or sheets in an ordered form 
suitable to facilitate their rearding and 
consultation thereof. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
sheet holder clamp for the uses referred previously, 
by means of which it is possible to maintain a set of 
documents, a newspaper or magazine in a constantly 
ordered condition suitable for reading, preventing 
individual sheets or individual pages from falling 
out and becoming lost accidentally. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a sheet holder clamp, as referred above, by 
means of which it is possible to maintain the set of 
documents, the newspaper or magazine resting on any 
shelf or hanging from a wall. Yet a further object of the present invention is to  
 
provide a sheet holder clamp which is easy to use, 
economical to manufacture and which adapts 
automatically to restrain, firmly clamped along one 
of their edges, either a small number of sheets or a 
set of greater thickness. The above is possible by means of a sheet holder 
clamp having the features of the claim 1. A preferred embodiment of a sheet holder clamp 
according to the invention will be illustrated 
hereinunder with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a front view of the clamp, in a closed 
condition; Fig. 2 is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A sheet holder clamp designed to restrain a set of 
sheets, a newspaper, magazine or the like by gripping 

it along an edge, characterised by comprising: 

a substantially elongated body (10) having 
first and second clamping jaws (11, 12), hingedly 

connected at one of their ends to be moved between an 
open condition and a closed condition to retrain said 

set of sheets; 
 
   and in that said jaws (11, 12) of the clamp 

comprise opposite clamping surfaces (17, 18) 
parallelly extending on one side of the clamp, said 

clamping surfaces (17, 18) being spaced apart to 
define a longitudinal groove for insertion of the 

abovementioned set of sheets, at least one (17) of 
said clamping surfaces having projections (20) which 

extend towards the other one (18) of said clamping 
surfaces, and disengageable hooking means (14) being 

provided to maintain the jaws (11, 12) of the clamp 
in the closed condition. 
A sheet holder clamp according to claim 1, 
characterised in that said clamping jaws (11, 12), on 

the internal side thereof comprise longitudinally 
 

extending shoulder surfaces (21, 22) matching one 
with the other in the closed condition of the clamp. 
A sheet holder clamp according to claim 2, 
characterised in that one of said shoulder surfaces 

(21, 22) of one (11) of the jaws (11, 12) is in the 
form of longitudinal ribbing (21) which extends in a 

similarly shaped longitudinal groove (22) in the 
other one (12) of said clamping jaws (11, 12). 
A sheet holder clamp according to claim 1, 
characterised in that said hooking means (14) 

comprises a retaining tooth (23) on one (12) of said 
jaws (11, 12), to engage a projection (26) on the 

other one (11) of said jaws (11, 12), said retaining 
tooth (23) being connected to said one of the jaws by 

an elastically yielding shank (24). 
A sheet holder clamp according to claim 4, 
characterised in that said retaining tooth (23) 

comprises an upper arched surface (27). 
A sheet holder clamp according to any one of the 
previous claims, characterised in that one of the 

clasping jaws (11, 12) is provided with a lateral fin 
(15) having a hole (16) for hanging the clamp.
