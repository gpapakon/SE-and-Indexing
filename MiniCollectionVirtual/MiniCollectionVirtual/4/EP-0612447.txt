<ABSTRACT>
An adaptive filter for the approximation of a read-in set function F in a function space, containing a set of n elementary filters gb, n being an integer  
>
= 1. The elementary filters cover a sub-space in the function space, the parameters of the elementary filter are changeable and the filter performs the following operation: calculating the normal projections of the set function F on each elementary filter and multiplying the normal projection quantities Aa thus obtained by the counter-variant metric tensor Gab formed from the set of elementary filters in order thereby to obtain the projection of the set function F on the sub-space covered, whose difference D from the set function F is determined as a function of the elementary filter and the metric tensor in accordance with the formula (I) in order thereby to minimize the difference D by changing the elementary filter parameters by means of conventional deterministic (e.g. "gradient fall method") or stochastic (e.g. simulated annealing, 'Monte Carlo method') methods of calculation, the desired approximated function being obtained from the superimposition of the elementary filters set by minimization in accordance with the formula (II).
