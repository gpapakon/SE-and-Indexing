<DESCRIPTION>
 LIGHT MODULATING DEVICES INCORPORATING AN IMPROVED ELECTRODERelated Applications This application is related to Miller et al. , U.S. Serial No.(Applicant Docket No. 44609USA1B, filed January 10, 1992) entitled "Polymer- Dispersed Liquid Crystal Device Having an Ultraviolet-Polymerizable Matrix and a Variable Optical Transmission and Method for Preparing the Same, " which is being filed concurrently with this application, is assigned to the same assignee as the present application, and is hereby incorporated by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to improved electrodes for light modulating devices.Description of the Related ArtLight modulating devices are devices whose optical properties change in response to an electric field and return to their original condition upon reversing or removing the field. One example of a light modulating device is an electrochromic device. Such a device relies upon a reversible chemical reaction to cause a change in optical properties. Another example is a liquid crystal display device whose optical appearance changes upon application of an electric field. A third example of a light modulating device is the so-calledNematic Curvilinear Aligned Phase ("NCAP") device described, e.g., in Fergason, U.S. Patent No. 4,435,047. These devices include a liquid crystal layer in which nematic liquid crystal material is encapsulated in a polymer matrix. The encapsulated material is prepared by combining the liquid crystal material with the polymer matrix in the form of an aqueous emulsion, and then casting a film from the emulsion. These devices are relatively translucent in the absence of an electric 

 field due to light scattering, but are relatively transparent upon application of a field.A fourth example of a light modulating device is the Polymer- Dispersed Liquid Crystal ("PDLC") device described, e.g., in Doane et al., U.S. 4,688,900. These devices include a liquid crystal layer in which liquid crystal droplets are dispersed throughout a polymer Tnatrix. The liquid crystal layer is prepared by combining the liquid crystal material with a polymerizable matrix precursor (e.g., one or more ultraviolet-curable monomers) and then subjecting the mixture to polymerization conditions. Polymerization causes phase separation of the liquid crystal material, resulting in the formation of liquid crystal droplets dispersed throughout the polymerized matrix. Like the NCAP devices, the PDLC devices are translucent in the field-off condition due
