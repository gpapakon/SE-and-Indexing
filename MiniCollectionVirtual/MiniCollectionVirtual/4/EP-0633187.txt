<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a machine for automatically forming packaging based on films (10) which are equipped with strips (12), comprising a forming neck (200), a filling chute (300), means (600) for longitudinal welding and means (700) for transverse welding, characterised in that the machine includes means (400) for localised pre-welding of the strips (12), which pre-welding means (400) are offset angularly with respect to the longitudinal welding means (600), and the machine includes means (500) for guiding the strips (12), located upstream of the pre-welding means (400). The present invention also relates to the packages thus obtained.

A machine for automatically forming, filling, and closing packages 
based on film (10) of thermoplastic material provided with section 

strips (12), in particular complementary male and female slideway-closure 
strips, the machine comprising a forming throat (200) which 

receives input film (10) in the generally plane state coming from 
payout means and which outputs the film (10) shaped into a tube, a 

filler chute (300) opening out into the forming throat (200) and 
consequently into said tube, longitudinal heat sealing means (300) 

for closing the tube longitudinally, and means (700) suitable for 
sequentially generating a first transverse line of heat sealing (702) 

before a product is inserted into the tube via the filler chute 
(300), and then a second transverse line of sealing (704) after the 

product has been inserted into the tube, thereby closing a package 
around the product, means (400) for localized presealing of the 

strips (12), which presealing means (400) are angularly offset from 
the longitudinal sealing means relative to the advance direction of 

the film (10), and strip guide means (500) situated upstream from the 
presealing means (400), the machine being characterized by the fact 

that the strip guide means (500) comprise both external guide means 
(510) for the film (10) fitted with the strips (12), and a spreader 

(520) placed inside the tube formed by the film, downstream from the 
forming throat (200). 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the 
external guide means (510) for the film comprise two elements (512, 

514) suitable for supporting respective opposite sides of a loop (16) 
of film including the strips (12). 
A machine according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that the 
two elements are respectively formed by a vertical plate (512) and by 

a rod (514) folded into an L-shape comprising two orthogonal branches 
(515, 516), one of which is fixed to the plate (512), and the other 

of which is situated in a vertical plane to support the loop (16) of 
film.  

 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized by 
the fact that the spreader (520) is formed by a vertical blade. 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized by 
the fact that the spreader (520) is vertically adjustable on a 

central vertical support (612). 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized by 
the fact that the guide means (500) are mounted on support equipment 

to pivot about a vertical axis. 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized by 
the fact that it also includes means (900) for guiding the strips 

(12) at the entrance to the forming throat (200). 
A machine according to claim 7, characterized by the fact that the 
means (900) for guiding the strips (12) at the entrance to the 

forming throat (200) comprise an arm (910) mounted to pivot about a 
generally horizontal axis (912) and supporting two wheels (920, 922) 

suitable for resting on the film (10) at the forming throat (200), 
which wheels (920, 922) are separated by an annular gap (924) 

suitable for receiving the strips (12). 
A machine according to claim 8, characterized by the fact that the 
arm (910) is mounted to pivot about an axis (912) parallel to a 

tangent to the forming throat (200) level with the zone where the 
wheels (920, 922) press against the film (10). 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized by 
the fact that the film (10) is prefitted, on entry into the machine, 

with the strips (12) that are placed at a distance from its 
longitudinal lateral edges (14, 15). 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized 
by the fact that it includes separate strip feed means, and means for 

fixing strips (12) to the film.  
 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterized 
by the fact that the strips are selected from the group comprising: 

complementary male and female slideway-closure strips; opening rip 
cords; decorative margins, in particular colored margins; and 

graduated margins suitable for assessing the volume of product 
contained in the package.
