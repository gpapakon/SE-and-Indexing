<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a signal level adjusting unit
for adjusting a level of an eight-fourteen-modulation (EFM)
signal to a given level, which EFM signal is read from an
optical disk in an optical disk player such as a compact
disk (CD) player, laser disk (LD) player or the like.Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows a circuit,
which is used to reproduce EFM signals indicative of read
digital data of an optical disk in a conventional 3-beam
type optical disk player. Such an optical disk player uses
three beams, i.e. a main beam for digital data reading and
focus control and two sub-beams for tracking control.
Referring to Fig. 1, the main beam reflected on the optical
disk is detected by four photodiodes 1-4. A signal detected
by the photodiodes 1 and 2, and a signal detected by the
photodiodes 3 and 4 are amplified by amplifiers 5 and 6,
respectively, and are added by an adder 7. Thus, the EFM
signals are reproduced, amplified by an amplifier 8, and
transmitted to succeeding circuits via an output terminal 9.Thereafter, the EFM signals are subject to clock signal
processing and error correction processing, and then are
demodulated into audio data. The EFM signals may have a
waveform as shown in Fig. 2A if laser beams pass on a
compact disk which is defective on its surface. Further,
the EFM signals may have a waveform as shown in Fig. 2B if
the laser beams pass across a plurality of rows of tracks.
The EFM signals not only include data such as audio data but
are also used to detect a defect on the optical disk on the 
basis of the waveform as shown in Fig. 2A or determine a
position of the main beam on the optical disk during access
on the basis of the waveform shown in Fig. 2B.Therefore, the EFM signals are very important from the
viewpoint of reproducing sounds and performing subsequent
processing and detection. Use of the circuit of Fig. 1
allows the reproduction of the EFM signals.In the 3-beam type optical disk player, when detecting
reflected beams by letting the main beam track a pit row, an
amount of light in the reflected beams varies with a size of
the pit. Therefore, peak and bottom values of an EFM signal
are variable as shown in Fig. 2C. Further, optical disks
have different values of reflectance, and reflect different
beams of differing extents. Thus, signal levels of the EFM
signals are different in optical disks. Further, the peak
and bottom values of the EFM signals are different in
respective optical disks.The EFM signals undergo waveform shaping so as to
facilitate processing
