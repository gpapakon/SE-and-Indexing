<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in the labelling of
monoclonal antibodies and other proteins with 32P. The term
"protein" as used herein includes polypeptides.Radiation therapy, particularly using 32P, is of interest as a
possible method of treatment of certain cancer conditions and it is
therefore of interest to be able to label antibodies or other
targeting molecules with 32P. However, the labelling of the
antibody or similar targeting molecule must be done in such a way
that the specificity of the antibody or similar targeting molecule
is retained in a labelled molecule that has appropriate invivo
stability.Our earlier Patent, GB-B-2,186,579, describes a system for
modifying a protein that will bind with a tumour-associated
structure comprising the introduction into the binding protein of a
peptide region which is capable of acting as a substrate for a
phosphokinase. The resulting modified binding protein can then
be 32P labelled by reacting it with a 32P labelled gamma nucleotide
triphosphate in the presence of a phosphokinase.In accordance with the procedures described in our earlier
Patent GB-B- 2,186,579, the peptide region capable of acting as a
substrate for a phosphokinase is introduced into the binding
protein by using a hetero-bifunctional protein crosslinking agent.
For example, the targeting molecule may be reacted with
N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) followed by
reduction with dithiothreitol. The reaction with SPDP introduces
the dithiopropionyl group onto a side-chain amino group of a lysine
residue in the targeting molecule while the subsequent reduction
step converts the dithio grouping into a terminal thiol group.
This terminal thiol group provides the reactive site for
introduction of the substrate molecule. In accordance with the procedure described in our earlier
UK Patent, it is then necessary to activate the substrate molecule
by reacting the N-terminus of the substrate molecule with a
bridging molecule which in turn can be reacted with the terminal
thiol group on the targeting molecule. For example, if the
substrate molecule has an N-terminal leucine residue, its amino
group can be reacted with an N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester to give
for example an iodoacetamide or a phenyl maleimide which can then
react with the thiol group of the thiopropionamido residue
introduced on the targeting molecule so that the substrate molecule
becomes attached to the targeting molecule through a short bridging
group including a thio link. If the substrate molecule has an
N-
