<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new non-woven
fabric material comprising hyaluronic acid derivatives,
methods of production thereof, and uses of said
material in medical and pharmaceutical applications.Hyaluronic acid is a natural heteropolysaccharide
composed of alternating residues of D-glucuronic acid
and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. It is a linear polymer with
a molecular Â· weight of between 50,000 and 13,000,000
depending upon the source from which it is obtained, and
the preparation and determination methods employed. It
is present in nature in pericellular gels, in the
fundamental substance of connective tissues of
vertebrate organisms of which it is one of the main
components, in the synovial fluid of joints, in the
vitreous humor, in human umbilical cord tissues, and in
cocks' combs.There are known, specific fractions of hyaluronic
acid with definite molecular weights that do not present
inflammatory activity, and which can therefore be used
to facilitate wound healing, to substitute for the 
endobulbar fluids, or which can be employed in therapy
for joint pathologies by intra-articular injections, as
described in European Patent No. 0 138 572 granted to
Applicants on July 25, 1990.Also known are hyaluronic acid esters, wherein all
or some of the carboxy groups of the acid are
esterified, and their use in the pharmaceutical and
cosmetic fields and in the area of biodegradable plastic
materials, as described in U.S. Patents 4,851,521 and
4,965,353 granted to Applicants.WQ-A 92/13579 (a document under Art. 54 (3) (4) EPC) discloses
a tubular medical device comprising a matrix and a thread embedded
in said matrix wherein both the matrix and the threads are
comprised of biocompatible, bioabsorbable, water-insoluble
esters of hyaluronic acid, and the thread is wound in a spiral.EP-A 341 745, EP-A 265 116 and EP-A 216 453 disclose the use
of hyaluronic acid and/or hyaluronic acid esters, e.g. in
the form of films, sheets or threads, in the field of
biodegradable plastic materials, to manufacture sanitary and
surgical articles, in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical fields
or in the food industry.WO-A 91/17744 discloses the use of hyaluronic acid and
hyaluronic acid esters as carriers for chemotherapeutics
incorporated in implants.Biomaterials Vol. 12 No. 8, pp 727-729 discloses the use of
hyaluronic acid esters for the preparation of thin membranes
to be added to cultures. Hyaluronic acid is known to play a fundamental role
in tissue repair processes, especially in the first
stages of granulation, by
