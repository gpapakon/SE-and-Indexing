<ABSTRACT>
A remotely-controlled apparatus, for example, a saw 
(2), for cutting a workpiece (4) includes a clamping 

assembly (5) for holding the workpiece during the cutting 
operation. The clamping assembly (5) comprises a 

workpiece locating means (24) in the form of an angle 
bracket in which the workpiece (4) is held by a roller 

chain (39) connected to a pneumatic actuator (15). The 
chain is attached at one end to the lower end of a chain 

attachment (37) mounted at the end of a piston rod (36) 
extending from the actuator. After passing around the 

workpiece, the chain is releasably engaged by projections 
(38) provided at the upper end of the chain attachment 

(37). Retraction of the piston rod (36) causes the chain 
(39) to pull the workpiece (4) against the locating means 

(24) so that the workpiece is held firmly during operation 
of the saw. The apparatus can be operated by remotely-controlled 

manipulators for cutting radioactively 
contaminated items within a shielded enclosure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a remotely-controlled apparatus for cutting a workpiece
and, in particular, to a workpiece clamping assembly for use with
a remotely-controlled saw.In certain situations it is desirable to cut
radioactively contaminated scrap metal items to the
required size so that the items can be disposed of in a
safe manner. This has required an operative to enter a
shielded enclosure, for example a cave or cell, to carry
out the cutting operation. An obvious disadvantage of
this procedure is that the operative may be exposed to
harmful doses of radiation.To overcome this problem it is known to locate the
cutting apparatus within the shielded enclosure and to
control the operation of the apparatus from a remote
location outside the enclosure (see e.g. EP-A-0 538 206). However, one difficulty
encountered with remotely-controlled cutting apparatus has
been the need for a suitable clamping assembly for holding
the workpieces during the cutting operation. The
requirements of the clamping assembly are that it should
hold the workpiece very firmly and must facilitate the
reception and removal of workpieces handled by remotely-controlled
manipulators installed in the enclosure.According to the present invention a remotely-controlled
apparatus for cutting a workpiece includes a
saw for cutting the workpiece and comprises a clamping
assembly for holding the workpiece to be cut, the clamping
assembly comprising a workpiece locating means, an
actuator having a piston rod extending therefrom and a
flexible band comprising a chain formed by a series of
spaced rollers interconnected by links and having a
portion contacting the workpiece when located in the
workpiece locating means, whereby movement of the piston
rod away from the workpiece locating means causes the
chain to hold the workpiece in the workpiece locating
means, wherein the chain is attached at one 
end to a chain attachment mounted on an end of the piston
rod remote from the actuator, and wherein the chain
attachment is provided with a projection which extends
through a gap formed between adjacent rollers in the chain
at a region thereof remote from said one end.The chain attachment may have two projections which
extend through two gaps formed between successive rollers
of the chain.Preferably, the chain attachment is adapted such that
the said one end of the chain is connected thereto at a
location below a longitudinal axis of the piston rod and
the projection or projections on the chain attachment
engage the chain at a location above the
