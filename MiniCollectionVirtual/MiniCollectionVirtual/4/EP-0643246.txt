<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a single-handle faucet (1), the flow 
rate of the water from it being controllable by a lifting or 

lowering movement of the handle (2) of the faucet and the mixing 
of hot and cold water by a transversal rotational movement of 

the handle. According to the invention the movement of the 
handle (2) is limited by at least two stops (13-15) placed 

transversal to each other and a limiting lever (16) colliding 
therewith, whereby one of the stops (13, 14) limits the flow 

rate from the faucet and the other one (15) the temperature of 
the water obtained therefrom. The limiting lever (16) is 

connected to a push-button (12) in such a way that the set 
limits can be exceeded by moving the limiting tip (22) of the 

limiting lever past the corresponding stops using the push-button 
and then continuing the movement of the handle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is a single-handle faucet in which 
the flow rate can be controlled by a lifting or lowering 
movement of the handle of the faucet, and the mixing of cold and 
hot water can be controlled by a transversal rotational movement 
with respect to said movement of the handle, and in which the 
movement of the faucet is limited by a step-shaped stop and a 
limiting lever colliding with it, the lever being connected to a 
push-button in such a manner that the lever can be moved past 
the stop with the aid of the push-button in order to continue 
the movement of the faucet. A single-handle faucet according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from the Finnish published 
specification 70994 (& EP-A-189170) which is provided with a stop and a motion 
limiting means colliding with it and formed as a trigger in such 
a manner that these together limit the rotational movement of 
the handle providing a limit to the temperature of the water 
from the faucet which can be exceeded by pressing the trigger so 
that it can move past the stop. The purpose is to prevent the 
accidental running of hot water from the faucet and to save 
energy by limiting the consumption of hot water. However, a drawback of present faucets is that large amounts of 
water are easily wasted. Especially when opening the faucet, it 
is easy to first turn the flow rate to maximum and then decrease 
it to a flow rate suitable for washing one's hands, for 
instance. Thus it would be possible to provide considerable 
savings by limiting the flow rate. The above invention, which eliminates the said drawback of known 
faucets, is characterized in that the faucet comprises at least 
two stops which are placed transversal to each other so that 
limits are set for the flow rate using at least one of the stops and for the 
temperature of the water provided by the faucet using the other 
stop, and the limits can be exceeded by moving the limiting 
lever past the corresponding stops with the aid of the push-button.  
 Thus it is essential for the faucet according to the invention 
that limits are set for both the flow rate and the water 
temperature using a single limiting lever which is pushed by the 
push-button. The limits can be exceeded when desired by simply 
pushing the push-button. The solution prevents unnecessary heavy 
running of water independent of its temperature, and in addition 
to this, especially the consumption of hot water is limited. An advantageous application of the faucet according to the 
invention is

<CLAIMS>
A single-handle faucet (1) in which the flow rate can be 
controlled by a lifting or lowering movement of the handle (2) 

of the faucet and the mixing of cold and hot water can be 
controlled by transversal rotational movement with respect to 

said movement of the handle, and in which the movement of the 
handle is limited by a step-shaped stop (13-15) and a limiting 

lever (16) colliding with it and connected to a push-button (12) 
so that the lever can be moved past the stop with the aid of the 

push-button for continuing the movement of the handle, 
characterized
 
in that the faucet (1) includes at least two 

stops (13-15) which are placed transversal to each other in such 
a way that at least one of the stops (13, 14) is used to set a limit to 

the flow rate and the other one (15) is used to set a limit to 
the temperature of the water from the faucet, the arrangement being such that the limits can be 

exceeded by moving the limiting lever (16) past the 
corresponding stops with the aid of the push-button (12). 
A faucet according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in 
that it comprises stops (13, 14) limiting the flow rate on both 

sides of the stop (15) limiting the temperature of the water so 
that the flow rate limited by the stop on the hotter side of the 

set limit of the temperature of the water is lower than that on 
its colder side. 
A faucet according to Claim 1 or 2, 

characterized
 in that the stops (13-15) are placed 
on the ball-like curved surface (4) of the cup-like portion (5) 

detachably attached to the body (3) of the faucet, said portion 
being movable in the rotational direction of the handle (2) to 

set the position of the stop (15) limiting the temperature of 
the water. 
A faucet according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 in 
that the body (3) of the faucet and the cup-like portion (5) 

comprise curved, mutually compatible indentations (25, 26) for 
detachably attaching the parts in question to e
ach other.  
 
A faucet according to any of the preceding Claims, 

characterized
 in that the limiting lever (16) 
comprises three legs (19-21) of which the first one (19) 

comprises a limiting tip (22) colliding with the stops (13-15), 
the second one (20) serves as a spring supported by the body of 

the handle (2), and the third one (21) is connected to the push-button 
(12) in such a way that it can be pressed against the 

spring force of said second leg (20) for releasing the limiting 
tip of the first leg (19) from the stop. 
A faucet according to Claim 5, 
characterized
 in 
that the limiting lever (16) is a separate piece the legs of 

which (19-21) are combined on the axis which is fitted to the 
body of the handle (2) in a chain link (24) formed for it.
