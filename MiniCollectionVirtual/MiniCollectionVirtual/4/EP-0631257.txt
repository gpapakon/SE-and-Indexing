<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of recording heads capable of ejecting 
inks of different colors is reciprocated relative to a 

recording material to print ink dots on the recording 
material while effecting main scanning in the forward 

and the backward pass thereof. A plurality of thinning 
patterns produced by preparing m x n unit picture 

element groups and arraying these unit groups in such a 
manner that the groups avoid mutually adjoining and 

assume a mutually complementary relation is used to 
effect a plurality of rounds of main scanning in the 

forward and the backward pass over an area which can be 
printed by one round of main scanning, record a thinned 

image, and complete the recording of an image. The 
array of picture element groups in the thinning 

patterns is determined so that the groups may mutually 
adjoin relative to the direction of main scanning.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ink jet recording
method and apparatus for recording an image on a
recording material by ejecting ink droplets in
conformity to the data of the image.In consequence of the dissemination of reproducing
devices, information processors such as word processors
and computers, and communication devices as well,
digital image recording devices adapted to operate by
use of an ink jet type recording head have been finding
widespread acceptance among other image recording
devices serving the apparatuses mentioned above. As a
recording head having a plurality of recording elements
arrayed integrally therein (hereinafter referred to as
a "multi-head"), the recording devices of this kind are
generally provided for the sake of enhancing their
recording speed with a modified multi-head which has a
plurality of ink nozzles and conduits integrally
arrayed therein. Further, to permit production of
color images, they are provided with a plurality of
such multi-heads.Unlike the monochromic printer which prints
characters exclusively, the color printer needs to 
fulfill various factors such as color development
property, gradient of tone, and uniformity in printing
color images. As regards the uniformity in particular,
even slight inconstancy possibly caused among nozzle
units by a deviation involved in the process of
manufacture of a multi-head affects the amounts of ink
droplets discharged through individual nozzles and the
directions in which the ink droplets are ejected in the
course of printing and eventually impairs uniform
density of a printed image and deteriorates the quality
of the produced image.A concrete example of this adverse case will be
depicted below with reference to Fig. 11A to Fig. 11C.
In Fig. 11A, 91 stands for a multi-head which is
identical with a multi-head shown in Fig. 12A. Here,
for the sake of simplicity, this multi-head is assumed
to comprise 8 multinozzles 92. Denoted by 93 are ink
droplets which are ejected by the multinozzles 92.
Generally, the ink is ideally ejected in droplets of a
uniform amount in parallel directions as illustrated in
the diagram. If the ink is ejected as just described,
then ink dots of a uniform size will land on the paper
surface as illustrated in Fig. 11B and form a wholly
uniform image free from uneven density (Fig. 11C).Actually, as pointed out previously, the
individual nozzles betray inconstancy of quality among
themselves. If they are used for printing in spite of 
the defect, the ink droplets ejected therethrough will
vary in size
