<ABSTRACT>
Method of fixing toner by applying fixing agent to an object 
accomodating unfused toner at predetermined positions by sparaying or 

dripping onto the object, or immersing the object from back surface of 
the object. The fixing agent causes the unfused toner to be half-dissolved 

or swollen on the surface of the object and the half-dissolved 
or swollen toner is dried up to be fixed to the object.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method
of fixing tuner by applying wet medium.Conventionally, there are a variety of practical
methods for fixing unfused toner on a paper surface after
being transferred thereto from a photoconductor of a dry
electronic copier or, a laser printer, for example,
including the following:
1. Thermal fixing methods:
[1] Thermoconductive method for fusing and fixing
unfused toner with a heated roller;[2] Radiation method for fusing arid fixing unfused
toner by radiating infra-red rays or flash;[3) Convection method for fusing arid fixing unfused
toner via a heat treatment in an electric oven;[4) High-frequency thermal method for fusing and
fixing unfused toner by heating water content of medium
and objective paper in an electronic microwave oven;2. Pressure fixing method for fusing and fixing unfused
toner by applying pressure generated by a high-pressure
roller:3. Wet fixing method for fusing and fixing unfused
toner by dissolving thermoplastic resin (being a
constituent of toner) with solvent via solvent
atmosphere.However, the above conventional fixing methods
respectively have a variety of technical problems
described below.When applying any of the thermal fixing methods,
unfused toner cannot properly be fixed onto all the
objective surfaces except for those which are having
specific sizes. Concretely, a proper heating means Is
essential to implement the thermal fixing method. 
However, because of technically difficult aspect, large
heating means cannot be applied. For instance, whenever
drawing image on a large-sized paper such as the Al or A0
class, image must be drawn on the paper surface with ink
of a slow-moving pen-plotter directly.On the other hand, since the above-cited pressure
fixing method necessarily applies such a high pressure
being more than scores of kilogram per square centimetre,
operator is obliged to introduce large-sized equipment
and soft-and-expensive resin such as polyethylene resin
or polypropylene resin for composing toner, thus
incurring too expensive processing cost.US 3383775, discloses a method of fixing a toner
image on a substrate by hot vapour treatment with a
fixing agent comprised of a two-phase mixture of water
and an organic compound, which has toner swelling
capacities and is insoluble in water.In GB-A-2026506, a powder mark is applied to a
substrate and then fixed by applying a solvent. The
powder comprises a soluble resin, a pigment and a solvent
insoluble component which serves to assist in rapid
drying of the solvent
