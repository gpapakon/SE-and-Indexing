<ABSTRACT>
New types of polymer latices and their use in photographic 
materials are disclosed. They are obtained by subjecting to radical 

emulsion polymerisation one or more radical-polymerisable monomers, 
whose emulsifier-free homopolymers or copolymers pos
sess a glass 
transition temperature below 65 °C, preferably below 30 °C, in the 

presence of a water-soluble polymer of a particular chemical 
formula. 
These new types of latices are preferably used in graphic arts 
contact materials, e.g. daylight materials They can be used in 

relative high amounts thus improving dimensional stability without 
deteriorating the scratch resistance too strongly. 
A preferred radical-polymerisable monomer mixture comprises 
n.-butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and acrylic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new types of polymeric latices
and their use in photographic materials.Coated photographic layers and complete photographic materials
must comply with a number of requirements concerning physical
properties. In order to avoid physical damage during manufacturing
and handling a photographic material must show a sufficiently high
scratch resistance. Furtheron, photographic materials must show a
good flexibility so that easy handling without the occurence of
creases or cracks is possible ; in other words, the materials may
not suffer from brittleness especially under critical low humidity
conditions. On the other hand, stickiness should be avoided. Still
furtheron, photographic materials must show a good dimensional
stability, meaning a minimal dimensional distortion during
processing especially during the drying phase at elevated
temperature. The requirement of dimensional stability is
particularly stringent for graphic arts contact materials often
serving in pre-press activity as final intermediates between colour
separations produced on a scanner and the exposure step onto a
printing plate. Several contacts, being duplicates of different
separations, have to be exposed in register on one and the same
printing plate and mutually different dimensional distortions would
lead to unacceptable colour shifts on image edges in the final
print.As well known in the art flexibility and dimensional stability
can be improved by the incorporation of so-called plasticizers.
These substances can be relatively low-molecular weight compounds,
preferably containing several hydrophilic groups like hydroxyl
groups, or they can be polymer latices preferably having a rather
low glass transition temperature. The former act in an indirect way
by retaining enough water in the gelatinous layer even at low
relative humidity. In this way the layer is kept sufficiently
flexible at room temperature, even at a high hardening degree of the
gelatinous layer while the required dimensional stability is
assured. Representative plasticizers include alcohols, dihydric alcohols,
trihydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, acid amides, cellulose
derivatives, lipophilic couplers, esters, phosphate esters such as
tricresyl phosphate, glycol esters, diethylene glycol mixed esters,
phthalate esters such as dibutyl phthalate and butyl stearate,
tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethyl acetate copolymers,
lactams, lower alkyl esters of ethylene bis-glycolic acid, esters or
diesters of an alkylene glycol or a
