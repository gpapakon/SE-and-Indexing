<ABSTRACT>
The improved film clamp comprises a base plate having an 
aperture defined therethrough and over which a film strip is 

positioned in a plane; a platen having a flat surface and an 
aperture (5) defined therein and mounted to said base plate with 

the apertures of said base plate and said platen aligned 
with each other when the platen is clamped to the base 

plate; and flexible gripping means (30) positioned around the 
periphery of the aperture (5) of either said platen, said base 

plate or both, each of said flexible gripping means (30) 
including a locating section (31) arranged so as to be inserted 

into locating slots (21,22,23) provided around the 
periphery of the 

aperture (5) of either said platen, said base plate or both, 
said locating slots being, when said base plate and said 

platen are clamped together, substantially perpendicular to 
the plane of the film strip and a gripping section angled 

with respect to said locating section outward from the 
aperture(s) so as to grip and tension said film strip 

between said base plate and said platen when they are 
clamped together.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to commonly assigned copending 
Application Serial No. 906,635 filed on June 30, 1992, 
entitled "Multiformat Film Clamp" and filed in the name 
of Eastman Kodak Company. The present invention relates to an improved 
film clamp for use in apparatus such as a film scanner, 
and more particularly, to a film clamp for holding a 
film extremely flat in a film gate in such apparatus. Figures 1-6 to which it is now made reference 
schematically represent a multiformat film clamp of the 
type described in commonly assigned copending 
application Serial No. 906,635 filed on June 30, 1992, 
entitled "Multiformat Film Clamp" and filed in the name 
of Eastman Kodak Company. Reference is now made to Figure 1 in which is 
shown an embodiment of the film clamp in the open 
(unclamped) position. In this embodiment, there is a base plate 2 
which has a fixed mount 7 attached to it. The fixed 
mount 7 supports a platen or a main clamp frame 9, 
which is pivotally mounted by two pins 8. The main 
clamp frame 9 is manually opened and closed by holding 
the relieved outboard corners 20 which act as handles. 
It is to be appreciated that the frame 9 does not have 
to be pivotally mounted to the base plate 2, but could 
be freely positioned over the base plate 2 or guided 
with vertical guides into clamping alignment with the 
base plate 2. Pivotally mounted to the inside opening of 
the main clamp frame 9 is a gimbal frame 11. Two pins  
 
10 allow the gimbal frame 11 to rotate about an axis 
parallel to the main clamp frame 9's pivot axes, 
defined by pins 8 to provide a first degree of freedom. Pivotally mounted to the gimbal frame 11 is 
an insert frame 13, which is pivotally mounted by two 
pins 12. The two pins 12 allow the insert frame 13 to 
rotate perpendicular to the main clamp frame 9's pivot 
axis to provide a second degree of freedom. A clamp insert 14 having an aperture opening 
5 is snapped into the insert frame 13 with a pair of 
ball plunger detents not shown. This allows the 
operator to quickly change the clamp insert 14 for 
different formats. Likewise, an aperture plate 3 is held in 
place via magnets (not shown) which are mounted 
slightly below the top surface of base 2. The gimbal frame 11 provides for self 
aligning of the clamp insert 14 (an insert for 35mm 
film is shown in Figure 1) to the surface of the 
aperture plate 3, when the clamp frame 9 is rotated to 
the close position (as shown in Figure 2). The film 1 is located along its width by four 
positioning pins 4 which are

<CLAIMS>
An improved film clamp comprising: 
a base plate (2) having an aperture defined there 

through and over which a film strip (1) is positioned in 
a plane; 

   a platen (9) having a flat surface and an aperture 
(5) defined therein and mounted to said base plate (2) 

with the apertures of said base plate and said platen 
aligned with each other when the platen (9) is clamped 

to the base plate (2); and 
   flexible gripping means (30) positioned around the 

periphery of the aperture (5) of either said platen (9), 
said base plate (2) or both, each of said flexible 

gripping means including a locating section (31) 

arranged so as to be inserted into locating slots (21, 
22, 23, 24) provided around the periphery of the 

aperture (5) of either said platen (9), said base plate 
(2) or both, said locating slots being, when said base 

plate and said platen are clamped together, 
substantially perpendicular to the plane of the film 

strip (1); and a gripping section (32) angled with 
respect to said locating section (31) so that, when said 

locating section is inserted into said slots, said 
gripping section is angled outward from the aperture(s)
