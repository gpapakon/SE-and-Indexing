<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a winding-type high-voltage resistant, resistive cord for 
preventing noises which comprises a fiber bundle (11), a core (12), a metal 

small-gage wire (13), a removal layer (15), an internal layer (16), an insulating 
layer (17), a braid (18), and a sheath (19), wherein the core (12) is formed by 

immersing the fiber bundle (11) in a fluorocarbon rubber coating containing 
fluorocarbon rubber filled with carbon and ferrite and regulated by a solvent 

which is MEK to impregnate the fiber bundle (11) therewith, and the internal 
layer (16) is made mainly of polyethylene (PE) similar to the insulating layer 

(17). The core (12) is not removed from the fiber bundle (11) during extrusion 
of the internal layer (16) which has good adhesion to the insulating layer (17), 

which prevents lowering of resistance to voltage due to corona discharge. The 
winding-type high-voltage resistant, resistive cord ensures sufficient resistance 

to voltage if a high voltage is required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a winding-type high-voltage resistant, 
resistive cord for preventing noise which is used as an ignition cable in an 
internal combustion engine of an automotive vehicle or the like and, more 
particularly, to a winding-type high-voltage resistant, resistive cord for 
preventing noises which is sufficiently resistant to voltage. High-voltage resistant, resistive cords for transmitting a high voltage 
generated at an ignition coil to a spark plug directly or through a distributer are 
of two types: a string-type wherein fibers are impregnated with carbon; and a 
winding-type wherein a metal small-gage wire having a high specific resistance 
is wound about a core made of a magnetic material or the like. Both two types 
of high-voltage resistant, resistive cords are required to have reduced electric 
transmission losses, excellent noise prevention effects, and good resistance to 
heat and voltage. The winding-type high-voltage resistant, resistive cords are disclosed in, 
for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 63-168915 (1988) and 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 60-3809 (1985). The former, as shown in Fig. 7, comprises a tension member 51 made of  
 
aramid fibers, glass fibers or the like, a core 52 formed by coating the tension 
member 51 with extruded fluorocarbon rubber in which a magnetic material such 
as ferrite powder is mixed, a resistance wire 53 wound about the core 52, an 
insulating layer 54 extruded and coating the core wire 52 and the resistance 
wire 53, a braid 55 coating the insulating layer 54, and an outermost sheath 56 
coating the braid 55. The latter, as shown in Fig. 8, comprises string-like fibers 61 formed by 
twisting glass fibers like the former, a core bundled layer 62 made of a 
synthetic resin such as silicone resin or the like and coating the string-like 
fibers 61, a metal resistance wire 63 such as a nichrome wire which is coiled 
around the core bundled layer 62, a conductive silicone rubber layer 64 extruded 
and coating the metal resistance wire 63, an insulating layer 65 coating the 
conductive silicone rubber layer 64, a braid 66 coating the insulating layer 65, 
and a sheath layer 67 coating the braid 66. The former can prevent the resistance wire 53 from shifting since the 
resistance wire 53 is buried in the surface of the core 52. In the latter, the 
conductive silicone rubber layer 64 extruded and coating the metal resistance 
wire 63 allows the metal resistance wire 63 to have a stable resistance. For
