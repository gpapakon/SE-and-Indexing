<ABSTRACT>
A high pressure fuel injector (12) has a railplug ignitor assembly 
(14) 

disposed on its nozzle (16). The injected fuel travels down the bore 
of the 

railplug (14). The railplug (14) delivers a plasma that travels down 
the bore of the 

railplug (14) in timed relation to the injected fuel to ignite the fuel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to direct injection of fuel into a
combustion chamber of an engine and ignition of the injected fuel by an
ignitor. A high pressure fuel injector assembly according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from GB-A-2 057 054.Direct injection in Otto cycle engines offers significant
performance benefits for both two-stroke and four-stroke engines,
including improved fuel economy, reduced exhaust emissions, improved
transient response, and increased power. However, adaption of direct
injection to a given engine may be confronted by one or more problems.For example, mounting space in a cylinder head may be limited,
and so the injector location may have to be compromised, possibly to the
detriment of combustion performance.Another example involves ignition of the fuel cloud created by a
direct injector. Particularly when the injector is used to create a stratified
charge in the center of the cylinder, ignition by spark plug may require
either extending fragile electrodes into the cylinder space, or else
compromising the ignition point by using a more conventional spark plug
to the side.Leaner air-fuel mixtures do not reliably ignite with conventional
electric spark mechanisms. Moreover, effective combustion of the fuel-air
mixture is often problematic. If the ignitor is located adjacent a relatively
cool combustion chamber wall, as with a conventional spark plug, the rate
of heat loss to the wall may lead to flame quench, incomplete combustion,
increased fuel consumption, and increased hydrocarbon emissions.In order to better ignite leaner mixtures, a much hotter electrical
energy source is required. Furthermore, in certain engines, such as two-stroke
engines, the fuel charge needs to be ignited very quickly.One means of providing hotter ignition is a new type of ignitor,
called a miniaturized railgun or railplug. Such an ignitor can produce a
high velocity jet that is driven by both electromagnetic and thermal forces.
U.S. Patent No. 5,076,223, describes a plasma jet ignitor, or railplug, 
which utilizes a plasma injector. The railplug of the '223 patent
operates on the principle of electromagnetics, wherein the
electromagnetic accelerating force causes plasma to propagate
down the railplug bore to achieve supersonic speeds at the muzzle
exit. However, even if a conventional spark plug were replaced by
a railplug, a separate fuel injector would still be needed, and
packaging and ignition issues would remain.The present invention relates to a novel association of a
railplug

<CLAIMS>
A high pressure fuel injector assembly (10) for injecting a
high energy plasma jet into a combustion chamber, comprising:


a high pressure fuel injector (12) having a nozzle (16) from
which fuel is injected; characterized by
a railplug assembly (14) being disposed on said nozzle (16) for
acting on the fuel as the fuel is injected from said nozzle (16),

said railplug assembly (14) comprising a bore
through which fuel injected from said nozzle (16) is passed upon

leaving said nozzle (16), said bore including insulative means (28,
30) supporting respective elongate electrodes (18, 20) on opposite

diametrical portions of said bore in mutually electrically insulated
relationship, said electrodes (18, 20) being arranged so that an air

gap (34) exists between them, said air gap being substantially
narrower at a first location (36), and being substantially wider at

a second location (38) at an end (40) of the assembly (14), such
that when a suitable electrical potential is applied across said

electrodes (18, 20), initial arcing occurs between said electrodes
(18, 20) at said first location (36), to ignite the fuel being injected from

said nozzle (16) into the railplug assembly (14).
A high pressure fuel injector assembly as claimed in Claim 1,
wherein said electrodes (18,20) comprise two electrodes that are

directly diametrically opposite each other. 
A high pressure fuel injector assembly as claimed in Claim 1
or Claim 2, wherein the injected fuel enters a cylindrical space

(42) of said bore formed by an inside diameter (44) of said
insulative means immediately upon being injected from the fuel

injector (10) and before reaching said first location (36).
