<ABSTRACT>
A method for fabricating a composite cladding 
comprised of a moderate-purity metal barrier of zirconium 

metallurgically bonded on the inside surface of a 
zirconium alloy tube which improves corrosion resistance. 

The improved corrosion resistance of the liner 
is accomplished by suitable heat treatment of the 

Zircaloy-zirconium composite cladding to allow diffusion 
of alloying elements, notably Fe and Ni, from the 

Zircaloy into the zirconium, in particular, to the inner 
surface of the zirconium liner. This diffusion anneal 

reduces the undesirable tendency of zirconium liner to 
oxidize rapidly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to nuclear fuel
elements for use in the core of nuclear fission reactors.
In particular, the invention relates to an
improved nuclear fuel element having a composite cladding
comprised of a metal barrier of sponge zirconium,
crystal bar zirconium or dilute zirconium alloy bonded
to the inside surface of a zirconium alloy tube.Commercial light water reactor fuel is composed of
uranium dioxide pellets in a sheath or cladding of
Zircaloy. In boiling water reactors, the cladding is
made of Zircaloy-2 alloy; in pressurized water reactors,
which operate with an overpressure of hydrogen, the fuel
cladding is almost invariably made of Zircaloy-4. Such
fuel is subject to a persistent failure mechanism known
as fuel pellet-cladding interaction (PCI), which occurs
on sudden increases of fuel rod power after sustained
operation at a lower power. The PCI mechanism is
believed to involve the simultaneous effects of stress
on the cladding imposed by expansion of the pellet and
the release of fission products, some of which act as
stress corrosion cracking agents.The general structure of a nuclear fuel bundle
assembly 10 for a boiling water nuclear reactor is shown
in FIG. 1. The fuel bundle assembly consists of a tubular
flow channel 11 of generally square cross section
provided at its upper end with a lifting bale 12 and at 
its lower end with a nose piece (not shown). The upper
end of channel 11 has an opening 13. The lower end of
the nose piece is provided with coolant flow inlet openings
(not shown). A plurality of fuel rods 14 are
arranged in parallel inside the fuel channel 11. The
top end of each fuel rod is held by an upper tie plate
15 and the bottom end of each fuel rod is held and
supported by a lower tie plate (not shown). During
reactor operation, recirculating liquid coolant, e.g.,
water, enters through the openings in the lower end of
the nose piece, flows upwardly through the spaces
between fuel rods 14 and discharges at upper outlet 13.One conventional type of fuel rod has a circular
cylindrical housing 17, i.e., cladding, made of corrosion-resistant
metal, e.g., zirconium alloy. The nuclear
fuel is housed in cladding 17 in the form of a
column of stacked pellets 16 made of fissionable and/or
fertile material. Each fuel pellet is a circular cylinder
having planar end faces disposed perpendicular to
the cylinder axis. The pellets are stacked with end
faces in abutment. A preferred fuel is uranium dioxide
or a mixture comprising uranium dioxide and plutonium
dioxide.The
