<ABSTRACT>
An umbrella including a central shaft (10), a plurality of 
fabric support ribs (24) extending outwardly from the central shaft, a 

fabric cover (26) associated with the fabric support ribs, a plurality 
of rib support elements (30) for supporting the fabric support ribs 

and a plurality of detachable attachment elements (32), each operative 
to detachably attach a rib support element onto a fabric support 

rib, whereby in response to strong winds or other forces, detachment 
occurs, thereby preventing breakage of the support ribs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to umbrellas generally. A great variety of umbrellas is represented in the 
patent literature including wind-resistant umbrellas and 
umbrellas formed of plastic materials. The following U.S. Patents 
are believed to represent the prior art: 216,490; 449,716; 
653,164; 667,719; 1,736,177; 2,474,516; 2,561,435; 2,607,362; 
2,788,792; 3,156,249; 3,177,883; 3,252,468; 3,254,658; 3,419,026; 
3,564,679; 4,347,862; 4,368,749; 4,834,126; 5,085,239.  The present invention seeks to provide an improved 
umbrella. There is thus provided in accordance with a preferred 
embodiment of the present invention an umbrella including a 
central shaft, a plurality of fabric support ribs extending 
outwardly from the central shaft, a fabric cover associated with 
the fabric support ribs, a plurality of rib support elements for 
supporting the fabric support ribs and a plurality of 
detachable attachment elements, each operative to detachably 
attach a rib support element onto a fabric support rib, whereby 
in response to strong winds or other forces, detachment occurs, 
thereby preventing breakage of the support ribs. The present invention provides easy of assembly during 
manufacture and repair. There is additionally provided in accordance with a 
preferred embodiment of the present invention an umbrella base 
including a plurality of concentric recesses each of a different 
size for accommodating a variety of differently sized umbrella 
shafts. There is further provided in accordance with a 
preferred embodiment of the present invention an umbrella 
including a central shaft having upper and lower portions, a 
fabric cover supported on the central shaft and a tiltable 
mounting assembly connecting the upper and lower portions of the 
central shaft, and wherein the upper shaft portion defines a 
first longitudinal axis and includes a recess opening at a  
 
bottom end thereof and defines a bottom end surface at the recess 
including a first surface portion extending perpendicular to the 
first longitudinal axis and a second surface portion angled with 
respect to the first surface portion, the lower shaft portion 
defines a second longitudinal axis, and wherein the tiltable 
mounting assembly includes a support element mounted on the lower 
shaft portion and defining a support surface extending perpendicular 
to the second longitudinal axis and having an upstanding 
portion extending into the recess on the upper portion, the 
upstanding portion including an angled bearing surface; and an 
anchor
