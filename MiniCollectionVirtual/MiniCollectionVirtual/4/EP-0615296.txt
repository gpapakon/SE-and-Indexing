<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries using
a non-aqueous electrolyte with lithium ion conductivity wherein a material capable of
incorporating and releasing lithium is used as a negative active material. In the present
application the term "battery" is taken to include a single cell as well as two or more
series-connected cells.Non-aqueous electrolyte batteries using lithium as a negative active material have
various advantages, namely a high reliability over long period due to a smaller amount of
self-discharge in addition to a high voltage and higher energy density. Therefore they
have widely been used as primary batteries of power supplies for memory backup, in
cameras and the like. However in recent years, following the remarkable development
of portable electronics equipment, communication equipment and so forth, various kinds
of equipment have been produced which require larger current outputs from the batteries
used in their power supply. It is therefore considered highly desirable from the
economic viewpoint, and from the viewpoint of size reduction and weight reduction, to
produce a high energy density secondary battery capable of repeated recharging and
discharging. For this reason, the research and development of more satisfactory non-aqueous
electrolyte secondary batteries have been considerably promoted, and such
batteries are now in practical use. However their energy density, charge and discharge
cycle service lives, and reliability are still unsatisfactory.Conventionally, three battery types are known, according to the positive active
material used in the positive electrode of the battery and each type has a different charge
and discharge reaction, characteristic. Namely, in the first type, only lithium ions
(cation) are input into and output from between layers of crystal lattice positions or gaps
among the crystal lattice by means of intercalation and deintercalation reactions and the
like as is the case with metal chalcogenides such as TiS2, MoS2, NbSe3 and the like, 
and metal oxide such as MnO2, MoO3, V2O5, LixCoO2, LixNiO2, LixMn2O4, and the
like. In the second type, essentially only the anion is stably input or output by doping or
undoping reactions as the case of conductive polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole,
polyparaphenylene and the like. In the third type, both anions and lithium cations can be
input and output as in the case of layer-like structure graphite compounds and conductive
polymers such as polyacene and the like
