<ABSTRACT>
The present application provides each storage cell (12) 
in an automated 

storage and retrieval system (10) 
with a mark, such as a bar code label, which 

is detectable to a vision system when the cell is empty. Further, each 
item storable in a cell is also provided with a mark, such as a bar code 

label uniquely identifying the item, which is detectable by the vision 
system. During an inventory of the contents of the system, the vision 

system is moved across the openings of the cells and scans for the marks. 
If an item mark is detected, entries in a data table are made indicating 

the location of the cell being scanned and its occupied status. The 
identity of the item detected can also be entered into the data table. 

On the other hand, if a cell mark is detected, entries in a data table 
are made indicating the location of the cell being scanned and its empty 

status. If neither mark is detected at a cell, additional steps can be 
initiated to determine the status of the cell. Consequently, the 

location of each empty cell and each occupied cell can be positively 
identified and recorded in a single scanning operation. The identity of 

each stored item can also be recorded with its location in the same 
operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automated storage and retrieval 
systems, and in particular, to a method and system for determining the 
occupancy status of the storage cells in such a system. In an automated information storage and retrieval system, also 
known as a library, numerous cells arrayed within the library are used to 
hold information media, such as magnetic tape cartridges or optical 
disks. (The term "cartridge" used herein refers to any retaining 
structure for information media. Although the present invention is 
described herein with respect to a magnetic tape library storing tape 
cartridges, it is not so limited but is equally applicable, for example, 
to an optical library holding optical disk cartridges, cartridge-less 
optical disks, optical tape cartridges and the like.) An accessor, 
furnished with a holding or gripping device and under the direction of a 
library controller, transports a selected cartridge between the 
cartridge's cell and a drive unit. The library controller is 
interconnected with a host device, such as a mainframe computer, which 
issues control signals related to reading/writing data from/to selected 
cartridges. Library units also typically include an input/output station or 
port through which a system operator can pass a cartridge to be added to 
the array and through which the accessor can pass a cartridge to the 
operator for removal. It will be appreciated that the library controller must "know" the 
identity of each cartridge and its location within the array of cells in 
order to be able to retrieve the cartridge for access. Typically, each 
cartridge has a unique identifying mark, such as a bar code label, on an 
edge of the cartridge visible through the cell opening. A vision system, 
such as a bar code reader, on the accessor can read the label when the 
accessor is positioned proximate to the cell. During an inventory of the 
library, such as when a new library has been installed, the vision system 
scans the cells and reports to the library controller the identity and 
location of stored cartridges. The library controller records the 
identity and location information in a database and later refers to it 
when a cartridge is to be retrieved or replaced or when a cartridge is 
imported from the outside and has to be stored in an empty cell. An  
 
inventory must also be taken each time a library access door is opened by 
the operator since it is not known whether the operator has added 
cartridges to the array, has removed cartridges, or has

<CLAIMS>
A storage and retrieval system, comprising a plurality of storage 
locations capable of holding a plurality of storable items: 

   scanning means for scanning a plurality of storage locations and 
detecting the presence of either a first mark or a second mark at each 

location, said first mark being located on each of the storage locations 
and said second mark being located on each of a plurality of storable 

items, said first mark detectable by said scanning means when a storage 
location is empty and said second mark being detectable by said scanning 

means when one of said plurality of storable items is stored in the 
storage location; and 

   means interconnected with said scanning means for recording a 
status indication for each of the storage locations scanned by said 

scanning means. 
A system as claim in Claim 1, wherein: 
   each first mark comprises a coded label fixed to an inside surface 

of a storage location; and 
   each second mark comprises a coded label fixed to an outside 

surface of a storable item and uniquely identifying the storable item. 
A system as claimed in either of Claims 1 or 2, wherein said 
scanning means comprises a vision system mounted on an accessor for 

transporting a selected storable item to and from a storage location. 
A system as claimed in claim 3 wherein scanning means comprises a 
bar code reader mounted on an accessor for transporting a selected 

storable item to and from a storage location. 
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising a 
drive unit for transferring information to and from on storable items. 
A system as claimed in Claim 4, further comprising a system 
controller interconnected to receive control instructions from a host 

device and direct actions of an accessor and a drive unit in response 
thereto, said system controller having an inventory table containing an 

address for each storage location, further having means for conducting an 
inventory of said storage locations whereby said system controller 

directs said accessor to move sequentially past the opening of each 
 

storage location to detect a first mark if a storage location is empty or 
a second mark if a storage location is occupied by a storable item, and 

store the storage location status and address for each storage location 
in said inventory table. 
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein said status 
indication is recorded in an inventory table. 
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising 
means for designating a storage location as having an unknown state if 

the scanning means fails to detect either a first mark or a second mark. 
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising 
means for directing a gripper to physically examine the insider of a 

storage location and to attempt to remove a storable item detected 
therein. 
A system as claim in claim 9, further comprising means for 
designating the storage location as having an invalid state if the 

gripper detects a storable item in said storage location and fails to 
remove it therefrom.
