<ABSTRACT>
A microwave oven includes a cavity (2) in which food 
(3) is accommodated, a magnetron (8) for generating 

microwaves, and a waveguide (7) to supply microwaves 
generated from the magnetron into the cavity. The 

waveguide has substantially a truncated cone configuration 
in which the cross sectional area at the cavity side is 

greater than the cross sectional area at the magnetron 
side, and an output antenna (13) of the magnetron is 

disposed to project from the bottom of the waveguide at 
the magnetron side into the inner space of the waveguide. 

The microwave oven further includes a flat radiation 
antenna (15) fixed in the inner space of the waveguide 

around the output antenna of the magnetron while 
maintaining distances from the waveguide and the output 

antenna of the magnetron in which no spark is generated. 
Therefore, the radiation area for emitting the microwaves 

is increased significantly to improve heating 
nonuniformity within the cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to microwave ovens, and
more particularly, to a microwave oven including an
antenna for radiating microwaves which realizes uniform
heating in a cavity.A conventional microwave oven is disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 62-295386, for example.
In this conventional microwave oven, microwaves generated
from a magnetron are propagated via a waveguide into a
cavity in which a food which is the substance-to-be-heated
is accommodated. Fig. 1 is an exploded perspective view
showing a structure of a waveguide of such a conventional
microwave oven.Referring to Fig. 1, microwaves generated from an
output antenna 101 of a magnetron not shown are propagated
within a rectangular waveguide 102. At a sidewall of
waveguide 102 in contact with a cavity not shown, a
projection portion 103 for coupling having substantially a
truncated cone configuration is provided projecting inward
the waveguide. A coupling aperture 104 is provided at the 
center of the top portion of projecting portion 103. A
cylindrical radiation antenna 105 is held by a cover 106
of a dielectric material so as to pass through coupling
aperture 104.Such a conventional microwave oven has microwaves
emitted into a cavity not shown due to an electric field
generated between cylindrical radiation antenna 105 and
the sidewall of coupling projection portion 103. The
direction of emission is unitary at right angles to the
electric field. Because the cross sectional area of the
cavity is extremely greater than the opening area of
coupling projecting portion 103 at the cavity side,
unidirectional microwaves provided to the cavity do not
spread out widely within the cavity, resulting in
unevenness in heating.To realize uniform heating within a cavity, a
microwave oven including a flat radiation antenna directly
secured to the antenna of a magnetron with a screw is
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 53-50122,
for example. Fig. 2 is an exploded perspective
view showing structures of a magnetron and a radiation
antenna of such a conventional microwave oven.Referring to Fig. 2, a flat radiation antenna 113 is
attached to an antenna 112 of a magnetron 111 by a screw
114 or the like. A plurality of slits 115 are formed in 
radiation antenna 113 for enabling energy emission in
various modes.Fig. 3 schematically shows a manner in which
microwaves are propagated according to the structure shown
in Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 3, microwaves (indicated by
open arrow) are emitted at right angles to an electric
field
