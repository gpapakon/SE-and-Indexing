<ABSTRACT>
A catheter (1) is formed by a bendable plastic tube and has a hollow channel (7) in its interior and a deflectable region (4) at its distal end in order to be controlled, for example, on insertion in branches of blood vessels. For deflection of the region (4) there is used a tension element (5) which extends eccentrically toward the centre and is surrounded by its own guide. The catheter (1) has a regular circular, oval or elliptical cross-section, and the tension element (5) and its guide are housed within the contour of this cross-section. In order to ensure that the catheter is bent only in its deflectable region (4) and not in the region leading to it, when a tensile force is applied on the tension element (5), the catheter (1) has a slightly flexible reinforcement extending up to the deflectable or flexible region (4) approximately in parallel with the tension element (5) and reinforcing the non-deflectable region within the catheter cross-section. This reinforcement may be a guide tube (8) made of metal or a hard plastic and receiving the tension element (5) as a guide, and/or another tension element (15) which is firmly installed on an opposite side of the catheter, about on a diameter, in parallel with the movable tension element (5) and extends only up to the deflectable region (4).

Catheter (1) having at least one hollow channel (7)
or lumen extending inside it, said catheter (1) being

formed essentially by a flexible plastics tube, the
distal end of the catheter (1) being elastically

flexible or deflectable by means of a pulling member (5)
which is eccentrically mounted relative to its axial

centre and which extends over substantially the entire
length of the catheter (1), for controlling the tip of

the catheter (1) for insertion into branches in the body
cavity system, e.g. blood vessels, the pulling member

(5) being distally fixed and surrounded, as far as the
deflectable region (4), by its own guide channel (16),

whilst the pulling member (5), up to its fixing point at
the distal end, and its guide channel (16) extend within

the outline of the cross section of the catheter (1), a
reinforcement which stiffens the catheter (1) relative

to its deflectable region is also provided within the
cross section of the catheter, up to the deflectable or

flexible region (4) of the catheter (1) parallel to the
pulling element (5), and the plastics tube which forms

the catheter (1) has an oval, elliptical or circular
cross section, characterised in that the guide channel

(16), up to the flexible region (4), is formed by a
guide tube (8) which runs as far as this flexible region

(4) and terminates there, in that the guide tube (8) is
provided as a stiffening reinforcement, in that the

guide channel (16) for the pulling member (5) has, in
the deflectable region (4), a transitional region (17)

which leads radially outwards relative to the guide tube
(8), approximately by the wall thickness of the latter,

and in that the pulling member (5) in the deflectable
region (4) is substantially at the same spacing from the

central longitudinal axis of the catheter as the wall of
the guide tube in the region of its abaxial generatrix. 
Catheter according to claim 1, characterised in
that the outline of the cross section of the catheter

(1) is constant and free from projections.
Catheter according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the guide tube (8) is made of metal, e.g.

stainless steel, or optionally hard plastics.
Catheter according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the guide tube (8) which

accommodates the pulling member (5) has an external

diameter of from about one third or two fifths of a
millimetre up to about one millimetre and an internal

diameter of from about one fifth to about four fifths of
a millimetre.
Catheter according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the cross section or diameter of

the pulling member (5), particularly a pulling wire,
thread or strip, has a play of from about one hundredth

to about one tenth of a millimetre relative to the
internal cross section of the guide tube (8).
Catheter according to claim 5, characterised in
that the pulling element is a metal thread or metal

strip.
Catheter according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the plastics tube forming the

catheter (1) has a greater wall thickness at least in
the region of the mounting of the guide tube (8) for the

pulling member (5) than in the wall portion
substantially diametrically opposite and in that the

guide tube (8) is at least partially embedded in the
thickened wall portion.
Catheter according to claim 7, characterised in 
that at least one additional channel (10) parallel to

the inner channel (7) with, in particular, a smaller
cross section than the inner channel (7) extends in the

thickened wall portion adjacent to the guide tube (8).
Catheter according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the catheter (1) is formed by two

plastic pipes or tubes (11, 12) fitting one into the
other, the outer tube (11) forming the sealed outer

shell and the inner tube (12) having radially inwardly
directed clamping fingers, retaining tongues or tabs

(13) spaced apart from one another in the longitudinal
direction of the tube (12), for securing or clamping the

inner guide tube (8) for the pulling member (5).
Catheter according to claim 9, characterised in
that the retaining tongues or tabs (13) or the like of

the inner tube (12) hold another tube (14) as an
additional channel, in addition to the particularly

flattened guide tube (8).
Catheter according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that, as an additional reinforcement

parallel to the eccentrically mounted pulling member
(5), on the side substantially diametrically opposite,

another pulling member (15) is fixedly mounted as a
counter-pulling member, extending up to the start of the

flexible region (4) and immovably secured there and at
the proximal end of the catheter (1).
Catheter according to claim 11, characterised in
that the plastics tube which forms it has a wall of

substantially constant thickness and contains on
diametrically opposite sides, on the one hand, a channel

with the guide tube (8) for the pulling member (5) which
is movable relative to the catheter (1) for bending and,

on the other hand, a channel for the immovable pulling 
member (15) which leads to the deflectable region (4)

and terminates there, particularly a solid wire or a
strip of metal, for example.
Catheter according to claim 11 or 12, characterised
in that, parallel to the channels for the pulling member

(5) and the counter-pulling member (15) serving as a
reinforcement, at least one other channel (10) is

provided as an additional lumen in the wall of the
catheter (1).
