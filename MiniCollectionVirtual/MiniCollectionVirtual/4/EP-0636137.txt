<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to synthetic phosphorothioated or partially phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotides capable of selectively modulating hemopoietic bone marrow cells development. More particularly, the invention relates to synthetic antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against a region spanning the AUG initiation codon in human ACHE or 2HS genes, having phosphorothioate bonds linking between the nucleotide bases; synthetic antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against a region spanning the AUG initiation codon in human ACHE gene, 2HS gene or BCHE gene or against a 5'-region in the human CHED (cdc2 homolog) gene, having phosphorothioate bonds linking between the four 3'-terminus nucleotide bases. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising as active ingredient at least one synthetic phosphorothioated or partially phosphorothioated antisense oligodeoxynucleotides according to the invention in a physiologically acceptable carrier or diluent. The antisense oligodeoxynucleotides of the invention and the pharmaceutical compositions containing them are suitable for inhibiting abnormal hemopoietic cells proliferation, inhibiting abnormal platelet proliferation, increasing stem cell fraction in bone marrow cell cultures, enhancing macrophage production and increasing stem cells counts, reducing immune response of organs to be transplanted, suppressing immune response of a recipient of an allotransplanted organ, and arresting growth of malignant tumors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The BCHE and ACHE genes encoding the acetylcholine hydrolyzing 
enzymes butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE, EC 3.1.1.8) and 
actylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) are expressed in 
various developing cell types, including embryonic [Layer, 
P.G. and Sporns, O., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:284-288 
(1987)], hematopoietic [Burstein, S.A., et al., J. Cell 
Physiol. 122:159-165 (1985)] and germ cells [Johnson, C.D., 
et al., Neuron 1:165-173 (1988); Malinger, G., et al., Mol. 
Neurosci. 1:77-84 (1989)]. Both AChE and BuChE include the peptide motif S/T-P-X-Z, 
which makes them potential substrates for phosphorylation by 
cdc2 kinases, the general controllers of the cell cycle 
[Lapidot-Lifson, Y., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 89: 
579-583 (1992)]. Most other substrates of cdc2 kinases 
perform biological functions necessary for cell cycle-related 
processes [Moreno, S. and Nurse, P., Cell 61:549-551 
(1990)]. Thus, interference with either CHE or cdc2 
transcription processes may be expected to divert and/or 
arrest cell division, and controlling these processes can be 
useful for several, medically important, procedures. Biochemical and histochemical analyses indicate that both 
AChE and BuChE are expressed, in high levels, in various 
fetal tissues of multiple eukaryotic species [Rakonczay, Z., 
et al., Subcellular Biochemistry 12:335-378, Harris, J.R., 
Ed., Plenum Press, N.Y. (1988)], where cholinesterases 
(ChEs) are coordinately regulated with respect to cell 
proliferation and differentiation [Layer, P.G., et al., 
Neurochem. 49:175-182 (1987)]. The specific role to be  
 
attributed to ChEs in embryonic development may hence be 
related with cell division, so that their biological 
function(s) in these tissues are tentatively implicated in 
the control of organogenesis. In addition to its presence in the membranes of mature 
erythrocytes, AChE is also intensively produced in 
developing blood cells invivo [Paulus, J.P., et al., Blood 
58:1100-1106 (1981)] and invitro [Burstein, S.A., et al., 
J. Cell Physiol. 103:201-208 (1980)] and its activity serves 
as an acceptable marker for developing mouse megakaryocytes 
[Burs- tein (1985) ibid.]. Furthermore, administration of 
acetyl- choline analogues as well as cholinesterase 
inhibitors has been shown to induce megakaryocytopoiesis and 
increased platelet counts in the mouse [Burstein, S.A., et 
al., Clin. Haematol. 12:3-27 (1983)], implicating this 
enzyme in the commitment and development of these 
haematopoietic cells. The DNAs coding for human
