<ABSTRACT>
A support for the rotor shaft (13) of a centrifugal 
pump with permanent-magnet electric motor. The motor is of 

the type which comprises a laminate-pack stator (10) with a 
coil-like winding and a rotor (11) placed in a cylindrical 

chamber (12) which is separate from the stator, the rotor 
being rotatable about the shaft (13) which is fixed axially 

therein. The support is characterized in that it comprises 
a tubular shank (19) which extends from the bottom (18) of 

the chamber (12) and in which one end of the shaft (13) is 
force-fitted. The bottom (18) has a through hole (20) at 

the shank.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a permanent-magnet
electric motor, particularly for
a centrifugal pump.A permanent-magnet electric motor with the features mentioned in the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in DE-A-2 809 973.Centrifugal pumps are already known, particularly in
the field of aquarium keeping, which are substantially
constituted by a box-like body which internally forms two
hermetically separated chambers: a first chamber for the
stator of a permanent-magnet electric motor and a second
substantially cylindrical chamber for the rotor of said
motor.The stator is embedded in epoxy resin, which isolates
it from the environment in which the pump is placed, that
is to say the aquarium.The box-like body also forms a third chamber,
connected to the second one, for an impeller which is
connected coaxially to the rotor.In these pumps, the rotor is rotatable about a steel
shaft which is cantilevered and axially fixed at the bottom
of the second chamber.A cap-shaped rubber part is generally interposed
between the shaft and the supporting seat and makes the
coupling elastic.During the operation of the pump, the second and third
chambers are filled with moving water owing to the rotation
of the impeller and, in the case of the second chamber,
also owing to the presence of a longitudinal recirculation
channel formed in the wall.The particular operating environment, that is to say 
the aquarium, entails that sand is suspended in the water;
as it passes between the moving parts, this sand causes
often early wear, particularly of the shaft.The steel shaft is furthermore the seat of induced
currents which cause the carbonate salts contained in the
water to adhere to it; in the course of time, this
naturally entails difficulties in the correct operation of
the pump.In order to obviate these drawbacks, shafts made of
ceramic material have been produced: as such they withstand
the abrasive action of the sand and are not the seat of
induced currents that cause scale formation.However, this has caused the onset of other drawbacks
which are due to the fact that the brittleness of the
material has made it necessary to fix it at both ends in
order to avoid breakages, but this has created problems,
making it difficult to replace the shaft in case of
breakage due to the difficulty in removing, in particular,
the stub which remains rigidly coupled to the support
located at the bottom of the chamber.Cantilevered ceramic shafts in fact break close to the
coupling point.Other drawbacks are due to difficult maintenance:
