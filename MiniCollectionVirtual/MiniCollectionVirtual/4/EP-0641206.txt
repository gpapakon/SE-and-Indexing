<DESCRIPTION>
Cigarette smoking continues to be the major
preventable cause of death in the United States resulting
in nearly 400,000 deaths per year due to cancer and
heart disease. Despite the potential adverse health
effects, the vast majority of cigarette smokers are
unable to cease smoking.The lack of smoking cessation success is
thought to be related to the tobacco withdrawal syndrome
or tobacco abstinence syndrome that most smokers experience
during their attempts to quit. See, Office of
Smoking and Health, The Health Consequences of Smoking:
Nicotine Addiction. A Report to the Surgeon General,
U.S. Govt. Print. Off., Washington D.C., DHHS Pub. No.
(CDC) 88-8406 (1988). The most common effects are similar
to those in almost all abstinence syndromes, and
include decreased heart rate, anxiety, difficulty concentrating,
impatience, irritability and restlessness.
See, American Psychiatric Assoc., Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual, Washington D.C. (3rd ed. 1980) at pages
159-160, 176-178. Most withdrawal effects occur within
24 hours, peak in the first 1-2 weeks and significantly
decrease at one month. It is widely believed that the
effects of abstinence from tobacco are due to nicotine
deprivation, and that abstinence effects from smoking
prevent smokers from stopping. See, J.R. Hughes et al.,
in Research and Advances in Alcohol and Drug Problems,
Vol. 10, L.T. Kozlowski et al., eds., Plenum Pub. Corp.
(1990) at pages 317-398.Of the pharmacological approaches to aiding
cessation of smoking, nicotine replacement, e.g., via
transdermal nicotine patches or nicotine gum is the most
widely used. Nicotine gum decreases abstinence discomfort,
especially anxiety, decreased memory and irritability.
On the other hand, nicotine gum does not reliably
decrease weight gain or craving. Also, discontinuing
use of nicotine gum leads to some of the same symptoms 
as the cigarette withdrawal syndrome. Furthermore,
nicotine is toxic, and the availability of nicotine gum
or patches poses a risk of poisoning to children and
pets.Other studies have demonstrated that alpha-2
agonists, such as clonidine, decrease postcessation
anxiety, irritability and difficulty concentrating.
Decreased sympathetic activity has been postulated to be
the mechanism by which these drugs decrease abstinence
effects. Although tobacco abstinence has some effects
that could be attributed to sympathetic activity, it
lacks the typical signs and symptoms of sympathetic
overactivity, such as tachycardia, diaphoresis and
hypertension. Thus, the mechanism by which

administration in an amount of from 1.0 to 100 mg/kg human body weight/day, of

active ingredient, calculated as
(-)-cotinine in the free base form.
The use of cotinine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to prepare a
medicament effective to maintain abstinence from, or assist cessation of smoking or nicotine

use, wherein the medicament is a unit dosage form containing from 30 mg to 1000 mg active
ingredient, calculated as (-)-cotinine in the free base form.
The use of cotinine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to prepare a
medicament effective to maintain abstinence from, or assist cessation of smoking or nicotine

use, wherein the medicament is in a form of administration in an amount of from 1.0 to 100

cotinine or a pharmaceutically acceptable 
salt thereof.
The use of one of claims 1-4, wherein the cotinine is (-)-cotinine.
