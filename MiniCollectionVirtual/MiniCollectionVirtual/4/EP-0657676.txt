<ABSTRACT>
A so-called stepless clamp structure whose clamping 
band (11) is provided at one end with a tongue-like extension 

(20) and whose other end (30) is provided with a slot-like 
opening (31). Outwardly extending hooks (23) on the tongue-like 

extension (20) are adapted to engage with the bent-up end 
section (35) of the other end which is of such length that a 

small part (34) of the slot-like opening (31) is present in the 
bent-up end section (35) whereby the depth ( 
d
) of the small part 
of the slot-like opening is less than twice the thickness of the 

clamping band but slightly greater than the thickness of the 
clamping band.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clamp structure, and 
more particularly to a clamp structure offering internal clamping 
surfaces devoid of discontinuities, steps or offsets to assure a 
fluid-tight connection of the object to be fastened thereby over 
the entire circumference. A distinction is made in the art between so-called 
closed or endless clamp structures made from tubular stock and 
so-called open clamp structures made from band material. In 
contrast to the former, the latter have to have their open ends, 
which usually overlap, mechanically connected in use. In 
addition to these clamp structures, devices for fastening, for 
example, cable strands are known in the prior art which are made 
from plastic material with serrations at one end adapted to 
engage in an eyelet with or without detent at the other end. 
Clamp structures, to be successful these days, especially in 
applications utilizing relatively hard and thin plastic hoses, 
such as in the automotive industry, must be able to assure 
internal clamping surfaces devoid of any discontinuity, steps or 
offsets to assure a fluid-tight connection. Moreover, there is 
an ever-present desire to simplify the construction and therewith 
reduce the manufacturing cost of clamp structures meeting these 
requirements. Clamp structures are known in which hook-like elements 
are provided near one end which are adapted to engage in an 
eyelet at the other end. For example, Swiss Patent 153,565  
 
discloses a clamp structure consisting of a clamping band 
provided with outwardly extending detent members at one end 
adapted to engage with the edge of a transverse slot provided in 
an enlarged part of the opposite end. Apart from wastefulness in 
the loss of material as a result of the enlarged end part, the 
clamp structure disclosed in this patent does not satisfy the 
requirements for fluid-tight connection. The German Offenlegungsschrift 23 59 284 discloses a 
clamp structure which includes a tongue-like extension near one 
end provided with outwardly extending teeth while the opposite 
end is provided with a slot-like opening into which the tongue-like 
extension is able to extend so that a springy tongue spaced 
from the opposite end which projects into the slot-like opening 
is able to engage with the teeth on the tongue-like extension 
during tightening of the clamp structure. Apart from a limited 
holding ability of the clamp structure disclosed in this patent, 
they also do not assure a completely fluid-tight installation 
because of the

<CLAIMS>
A clamp structure, comprising clamping band 
means (11), means (12, 36) for tightening the clamp structure 

about an object to be fastened thereby, and further means (23) 
for holding the clamping band means in its tightened condition in 

such a manner that it provides internal clamping surfaces 
substantially devoid of any discontinuity, step or offset over 

substantially its entire circumference to assure a completely 
satisfactory fluid tight connection, said further means including 

a tongue-like extension (20) at one end of the clamping band 
having outwardly extending hook means (23), a slot-like 

opening (31) extending in the circumferential direction within 
the area of the opposite end portion (30) of the clamping band 

means, said slot-like opening (31) having a width (
a
) at least 
equal to the width (
b
) of the tongue-like extension, and said 
opposite end portion (30) being bent up at such point of the 

clamping band means that the bent-up end section (36) formed 
thereby includes a small part (34) off said slot-like 

opening (31), and said small part (34) of said slot-like 
opening (31) having a depth (
d
), at least, approximately 
corresponding to the thickness of the clamping band means so that 

the radially inward edge of said slot-like opening in said bent-up 
section is adapted to engage with the corresponding hook 

means (23) and at the same time prevents the tongue-like 
extension (20) extending therethrough from outward escape.  

 
A clamp structure according to claim 1, wherein 
said tightening means includes two tool-engaging surface 

means (13, 36), one (36) of said tool-engaging surface means 
being formed by said bent-up end section (135) and the other 

tool-engaging means (13) being formed by an outwardly extending 
part (12) of the clamping band means. 
A clamp structure according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein said outwardly extending part (12) is formed by an 

outwardly extending cold-deformed, deep-drawn 
tunnel-shaped embossment separated at both ends from the clamping 

band means by substantially transversely extending cuts so as to 
be integral substantially along its sides, and wherein said 

embossment (12) is located in said clamping band means (11) 
within the area near the tongue-like extension (20) with the 

transversely extending surface (13) of said embossment on the 
side thereof opposite said tongue-like extension forming said 

other tool-engaging surface means.
