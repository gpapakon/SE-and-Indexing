<ABSTRACT>
A disconnector (isolator) for a surge arrester, which works using earthing (2) overvoltage surge arresters (1) for protecting loads (consumers) (3) or networks or power packs to be protected, the overvoltage surge arrester (1) working, for its part, in the event of faults, by at least one working contact (5) in an earth conductor in the arrester path, the monitoring device (4) working with a toroidal core (6) made of magnetically conducting material, by means of which the earth conductors are fed through as primary conductors (7) or primary winding, and its secondary winding (8) being connected to a tripping device (9), which is functionally connected to at least one working contact (5). It is provided for a rectifier arrangement (10) to be connected downstream of the secondary winding (8), which rectifier arrangement supplies, via a voltage limiter (11) and a pulse broadening device (12), a delay circuit (13) which is connected downstream of the tripping device (9).

<CLAIMS>
Diverter isolator which operates with surge 
diverters (1) to earth (2) for the purpose of 

protecting loads (3) or power supply systems and/or 
power supply units which are to be protected, with the 

surge diverters (1) being safeguarded for their part in 
the case of defects by means of a monitoring device (4) 

which operates into at least one operating contact (5) 
in an earth conductor in the diversion pull, with the 

monitoring device (4) operating with a toroidal core 
(6) which is made of magnetically conductive material 

and through which core the earth conductor is guided as 
a primary conductor (7) or a primary winding, and the 

secondary winding (8) of which core is connected to a 
trip (9) which is operatively connected to at least the 

operating contact (5), characterised in that connected 
downstream of the secondary winding (8) there is a 

rectifier arrangement (10) which by way of a voltage 
limiter (11) and a pulse-spreading device (12) supplies 

a time-delay circuit (13), downstream of which the trip 
(9) is connected. 
Diverter isolator according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the rectifier arrangement (10) is 

realized as a bridge-connected rectifier. 
Diverter isolator according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the voltage limiter (11) is a 

diode. 
Diverter isolator according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the pulse-spreading device (12) 

is realized as a capacitor. 
Diverter isolator according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the time-delay circuit (13) is 

realized in a manner known per se as an RC element. 
Diverter isolator according to one of the 
claims 1-5, characterised in that connected upstream of 

the voltage limiter (11) there is an additional  
 

voltage-limiting arrangement (16), upstream of the 
rectifier (10), in order to attain surge withstand 

strength.
