<ABSTRACT>
Hypodermic syringe or medical sampler has a hollow needle (115) that is automatically retractable after use. A one-piece body (101) moulding has a main chamber for a plunger (105) or sampler container or drug cartridge, a forward chamber (111) to house a spring (133) to bias a needle holder (117), and internal latching formations (141) to retain the needle holder (117) with the spring (133) compressed in the forward chamber until automatic retraction when the latching formations (141) are released by end of plunger movement. Direct plunger-to-body sealing involves an over-size plunger head (105 H) forcing head and wall deformation. Both ends of the spring (133) have seals (119, 160) for the forward chamber (111). The needle, its holder, spring and seals can be installed using a sliding guide. Pressure testing can be combined with needle lubrication, and retraction prevention with sterilising tell-tale. The plunger (105) has top and grip formations (105 F) for the needle holder (117), and the needle can be double ended for taking samples or emptying drug cartridges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to protection against
accidental skin piercing by needles of used hypodermic
syringes or medical samplers, or the like.A used such needle poses a health hazard and
considerable attention has been directed to reducing the
hazard by disposal regimes and means of sheathing the
needle tip after use. Also, numerous proposals have been
made for automatic retraction of a needle after one use,
but to date no-one appears to have put forward a practical
proposal that is reliable and commercially viable to make,
certainly not so that production costs are reasonable
compared with the costs of existing products without needle
retraction.The present invention aims to improve practicality and
viability in providing for reliable automatic needle
retraction.A large number of generally impractical or
uncommercial prior proposals for hypodermic syringes with
automatic needle retraction after use have been considered.
They typically require the hollow needle to be fixed to a
holder, commonly called a 'hub', and for such hub to be
acted upon by a compression spring and by releasable detent
or trigger means to release spring action and forcibly send
the needle and its holder into the interior of the syringe
or sampler, often into the plunger which will be hollow at
least for that purpose. Generally, however, such 
provisions, including detent or trigger means, involve or
are involved in an assembly attachable to the forward end
of the syringe or sampler body and/or plunger, and/or in a
part or parts fitted interiorly of the body, whether to the
body or to the plunger or to both. Such provisions tend to
be costly in themselves and in terms of assembly.According to one aspect of this invention, a syringe
body for a syringe device that is sterilisable and has a
needle that is hollow for passage of contents of the
syringe and is automatically retractable after use, the
syringe body having an interior which comprises a main
elongate cylindrical chamber adapted for taking a plunger
in slidable sealing relation therein and a forward chamber
extending distally from the main chamber beyond the end of
the plunger movement and being adapted to house a spring to
bias a holder for the needle, the syringe body having
integrally moulded internal latching formations which are
resiliently radially flexible and extend from the forward
chamber towards and into the main chamber in directions
generally parallel with longitudinal axis of the body, the
integral internal latching formations serving in use for
retaining
