Motor vehicle wiper (10) of the type having a drive head (18) which comprises a front 
part (24) on which is articulated a wiper arm (12) which carries a wiper blade (14) and 

a rear part (28) having means (32) of fixing the drive head on the end of a shaft driving 
the wiper in rotation, and having a removable cover (26) for protecting the fixi
ng means 
which has a lateral wall (60, 62) which at least partially surrounds the lateral face (29) 

of the rear part (28) of the drive head (18) and a top wall (64) which at least partially 
covers the top face (36) of the drive head (18) and the means of fixing this rear part to 

the drive shaft and which has means (38, 68) for holding in position the cover (26) on 
the drive head (18), the said means of holding the cover having a protuberance (68) 

formed on the bottom face (66) of the top wall (64) of the cover (26) and which is 
received between the opposite faces (37) of an opening (38) formed in the drive head 

(18, 24), characterised in that the protuberance is a rib (68) which extends longitudinally 
from the front edge (76) of the top wall (64) of the cover (26), in that the opening is a 

longitudinal slot (38) formed in the front part (24) of the drive head and in that the rib 
(68) is received clamped between the opposite faces (37) of the slot (38). 
Wiper according to Claim 1, characterised in that the slot (38) is a median slot which 
vertically divides the front part (24) of the drive head into two parallel lateral cheeks 

(40). 
Wiper according to Claim 2, characterised in that the drive head (18) has a stem 
which extends transversely into the said slot (38) to allow the attachment of a wiping-pressure 

spring, one end of which is received between the cheeks (40). 
Wiper according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the rib (68) 
consists of two parallel plates (70) which extend vertically, projecting from the internal 

face (66) of the top wall (64) of the cover (26).  
 
Wiper according to Claim 4, characterised in that the two parallel plates (70) are 
connected together by a transverse reinforcement web (74) which extends vertically, 

projecting from the internal face (66) of the top wall (64) of the cover. 
Wiper according to Claim 5, characterised in that the transverse reinforcing web is 
situated substantially halfway along the rib (68). 
Wiper according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the profile 
of the bottom edge (72) of the rib (68) is complementary to the profile (42) of the facing 

portion of the bottom of the slot (38). 
Wiper according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the holding 
means include an articulation nose (86) formed on the cover (26) which cooperates with 

a complementary part (54) of the drive head so as to allow the cover (26) to pivot about 
an axis perpendicular to the principal direction of the rib (68). 
Wiper according to Claim 8, characterised in that the articulation nose (86) is formed 
on the internal face (66) of the top wall (64) of the cover (26) and in that it cooperates 

with a complementary housing (54) formed opposite in the drive head (18). 
Wiper according to Claim 9, characterised in that the articulation nose (86) consists 
of a convex profile portion, in the shape of an arc of a circle, of a flange (84) which 

extends vertically from the internal face (66) of the top wall (64) of the cover and which 
is received in an open concave cylindrical housing (54) formed in the front part of the 

drive head. 
Wiper according to Claim 10 taken in combination with any one of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterised in that the flange (84) is parallel to the said plates (70).  

 
Wiper according to Claim 11 taken in combination with one of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the flange (84) is offset laterally with respect to the rib (68), and 

in that the said open concave cylindrical housing (54) is formed in the facing portion of 
the edge (52) of one of the parallel lateral cheeks (40) of the front part (24) of the drive 

head (18). 
Wiper according to one of Claims 11 or 12 taken in combination with one of Claims 
5 or 6, characterised in that the flange (84) is connected to the adjacent plate (70) of the 

rib (68) by the said transverse reinforcing web (74). 
Wiper according to any one of Claims 8 to 13, characterised in that the articulation 
means of the cover include two articulation noses (86) arranged substantially 

symmetrically on each side of the rib (68). 
Wiper according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the cover 
(26) has at least one locking nose (88) formed projecting on the internal face of the 

cover and which cooperates with a notch (58) formed opposite in the drive head (18). 
Wiper according to Claim 6, characterised in that the locking nose (88) is formed 
on the internal face (82) of the rear wall (62) of the cover, in the vicinity of the lower 

edge of the latter, and in that it cooperates with a notch (58) formed opposite in the 
bottom face (34) of the rear part (28) of the drive head (18). 
Wiper according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the top 
wall (64) of the cover (26) is extended, beyond its front edge (76), by a flap (90) which
