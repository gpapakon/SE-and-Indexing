<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transfer sheet
comprising a polycarbonate-based resin for printing media
of electrophotographic copying machines or printers.The transfer sheet has the function of transferring
the image formed on a photosensitive drum and as occasion
demands, the functions of transferring and releasing a
copying paper, and usually has a drum- or belt-like shape.
This transfer sheet is required to meet various and high-level
property requirements such as excellent electrical
and mechanical properties and high flame retardancy.
Regarding the electrical properties of the transfer sheet,
the charging and discharging characteristics are of much
account for attaching of the copying paper on the transfer
sheet, smooth carriage of the copying paper and transfer of
the toner.In use with certain kinds of copying machine, the
transfer sheet is required to have excellent creep
properties and fatigue fracture resistance, since the
transfer sheet is mechanically deformed when releasing the
copying paper. In use with another type of copying
machine, the transfer sheet is required to have durability
against repetitive bending since the transfer sheet is
turned in a belt-like state when passed between the rolls. 
Such mechanical durability needs to be high enough to stand
several tens of thousand times of copying.The transfer sheet must be replaced with new one when
the copy image quality has dropped due to fatigue
deformation of the sheet. It is preferable that the
transfer sheet be transparent because when the sheet is
changed, the new one can be readily set at the accurate
position and the workability is bettered. Thus, the
transfer sheet is required to have a parallel ray
transmittance of not less than 60%, preferably not less
than 80%. Also, since the transfer sheet is a part of an
electromechanical part, its flame retardancy is made much
account of and the transfer sheet is required to meet the
requirements of not less than V-2 level of UL (Underwriters
Laboratories Inc.) Standards No. 94.Further, there is a conflict that when it is tried to
satisfy one property requirements, it is found difficult to
meet other requirements. For example, when it is attempted
to satisfy the requirement for flame retardancy, it is
become to deteriorate the mechanical durability (fatigue
strength) and the transparency. Also, when reducing a
sheet thickness, the transparency becomes favorable, but
the flame retardancy becomes deteriorated.Japanese Patent Publication No. 56-25953 suggests that
compositions comprising
