<ABSTRACT>
A display arrangement includes a memory for storing 
image signals of one field supplied to an LCD display 

section, a comparator for determining whether the image 
signals of the next field to be supplied to the LCD display 

are those for a fixed image display or a changing 
image display by comparing those image signals with the 

image signals of the preceding field stored in the memory, 
and a controller for controlling a display driver so 

that, when the comparator determines that the image signals 
are for a fixed image display, the driver drives the 

LCD panel in a reduced-power drive mode. In one embodiment, 
the reduced-power drive mode is a spread-out mode 

and, in another embodiment, the reduced-power drive mode 
is a low-voltage mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to display arrangements
which are adaptable for various portable devices,
such as data-processing, communication, video and game
devices, and for devices such as wireless communication
devices carried on ships and in motor cars.In conventional display devices used for laptop personal
computers, for example, a liquid crystal display
(LCD) panel of the thin-film transistor (TFT) active-matrix
type in which pixels are arrayed in a matrix fashion,
is used for a display section. The LCD panel is
driven by a driving arrangement such as a source-gate
driver while supplied with voltage from a battery so as
to display an image.In conventional LCD panels, as shown in Fig. 4, an
array containing signal electrodes 1, scan electrodes 2,
TFTs 3 and pixel electrodes 4 is provided on one side of
an insulating substrate (not shown) in the form of a matrix.
A corresponding array of common electrodes 5 is
formed on the other side of the insulating substrate, and
a liquid crystal layer is interposed between the common
electrodes 5 and the pixel electrodes 4. The pixel electrodes
are selectively driven to display an image when
appropriate voltages are applied by line-sequential scanning
of the signal electrodes 1 and the scan electrodes
2. When a scan voltage is applied to the scan electrodes
2 of the first line of pixels by a gate driver 6,
the TFTs 3 of the first line connected to the scan electrode
2 are rendered conductive. In this state, the signal
electrodes 1 are connected to the pixel electrodes 4
of the first line, and a signal voltage (i.e., an image
signal) is applied to the pixel electrodes 4 of the first
line from a source driver 7. By repeating this voltage
application at horizontal scan intervals, the scan drive
operates sequentially from the first line to all subsequent
lines, and the display panel displays an image of
one field. By repeating the voltage-applying operation
to every field at vertical scan intervals, a complete
image is reproduced. The polarity of the signal voltage
applied to the pixel electrodes 4 is inverted every line
or every field so as not to cause a DC component to accumulate
on the LCD panel.In this type of the display device, the necessity
for a high duty cycle requires an increase in the LCD
drive voltage. Accordingly, the voltage from the power
source applied to the LCD panel is also set relatively
high. As a result, the power consumed during the image
displaying operation is increased. This increase in power
consumption presents difficulties for

A display arrangement comprising:

a display section (

said display section (

) having an after image effect;
memory means (

to the display section (

);
comparison circuit means (
14
) for determining whether
the image signals supplied to the display section (
8

those for
 a constant image or for a changing image display
by comparing the image signals to be supplied to the

display section (

to the display section (

level of the drive required to maintain the image display

or to such an extent as to be at a minimum display level.
