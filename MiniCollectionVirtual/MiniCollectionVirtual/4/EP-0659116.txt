<ABSTRACT>
A container made of recyclable plastics is manufactured in a simple and economic manner by co-extrusion then by thermoforming. The container has a wall made of a support layer (11), an inner layer (12) and if required at least one additional layer (13-18), which adhere to each other. Certain layers may be separated by applying a predetermined force. The inner layer (12) and if required an additional layer (13) or layers (13-18) protect the support layer (11), which constitutes the major part of the container material, from contamination with the filling material. The support layer (11) may thus be preserved in its pure form and can be recycled in the manufacture of new, high-quality products, once the filling material has been emptied and the inner layer (12), as well as any additional layers (13-18), have been removed. A collecting and transporting container for said containers allows them to be effectively collected, transported and recycled. A process for manufacturing said container in a simple and economic manner is also disclosed.

A multi-wall container (10) manufactured by a flat 
co-extruded sheet with subsequent thermo-forming, in which the 

container (10) consists of a support layer (11), an inner layer 
(12), and optionally at least one further layer (13-18) which 

adhere to each other after the co-extrusion, the inner layer (12) 
being arranged at least in that region of the support layer (11) 

which otherwise would come into contact with the contents of the container 
and the adhesion of the individual layers (11-18) being 

adjustable by the co-extrusion process and the inner layer (12), 
as well as a further layer (13-18) optionally arranged on the outer 

side of the container can be removed by a predetermined force. 
A container according to Claim 1, in which the 
support layer (11) of the container wall imparts substantially 

the entire dimensional stability and strength and is 
substantially thicker than the inner layer (12) and every further 

layer (13-18) if any. 
A container according to Claim 1 or 2, the 
container being sterilizable. 
A container according to any of the preceding 
claims, in which at least one of the further layers (13-18) is 

a barrier layer. 
A container according to any of the preceding 
claims, in which the adherence between the inner layer (12), a 

further layer (13-18) optionally present on the outer side of the 
container, and the adjoining layer is 0.5 to 10 N/cmÂ².  

 
A container according to any of the preceding 
claims, in which the inner layer (12) comprises a PE-PP-copolymer 

or PP-homopolymer. 
A container according to any of the preceding 
claims in which the layer which is in contact with the inner 

layer (12) comprises a mixture of a PE-PP copolymer and a PE 
homopolymer in a ratio, expressed in wt.%, of 70:30 to 30:70. 
A method of manufacturing a container according to 
any of the preceding claims, in which a co-extrudate is produced 

which comprises all layers of the subsequent container wall and 
thereupon the flat co-extrudate obtained is subjected to a 

thermo-forming process for the shaping of the container. 
A collection and transport box (50; 51) with 
container (10) according to any of Claims 1-7, in which the box 

(50; 51) consists substantially of the same plastic material as 
the support layer (11) of the container (10). 
The use of a container according to any of Claims 
1-7 for the packing of foodstuffs, beverages or pharmaceutical 

or cosmetic products.
