<ABSTRACT>
A freshness keeping sheet comprises:
 

   100 parts by weight of a palladium chloride-carrying 
activated carbon obtained by activating a carbon material 

under an atmosphere containing not more than 15% by volume 
of water vapor and cooling the activated carbon material to 

not more than 300°C under the same atmosphere and then 
permitting the resulting activated carbon to carry 0.1 to 

10% by weight of palladium chloride, and
 

1 to 20 parts by weight of a synthetic fiber having a single 
fiber diameter of 1 to 30µm as a binder,

 
said palladium chloride-carrying activated carbon and said 

synthetic fiber having been mixed and integrally molded into 
a sheet.

 
The sheet can rapidly remove thin ethylene from a gas even 

at low temperatures and is hence excellent as a freshness 
keeping sheet for refrigerators and vegetables and fruits 

storing boxes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to freshness keeping
sheets and also to a method for keeping vegetables and
fruits fresh by use of the freshness keeping sheets. More
specifically, the present invention relates to freshness
keeping sheets obtained by adding palladium chloride having
oxidation catalytic activity to activated carbon and molding
the carbon into sheets, and to a method for keeping fresh,
by use of the sheets, vegetables and fruits preserved in a
box or a section of refrigerator for storing them.The use of a catalyst comprising palladium chloride
carried on activated carbon for oxidation of carbon monoxide
or ethylene is known. In this case, particulate or granular
activated carbon has been mostly used as a carrier [Nihon
Kagakukaishi, p.1092-1087 (1972), Japanese Patent
Publication No. 10776/1985, Japanese Patent Application
Laid-open No. 55147/1981]. The present applicant has
applied for patent of an activated carbon carrying palladium
chloride (Japanese Patent Application No. 10776/1985 and
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 55147/1981). In
the applications, the activated carbon to carry palladium
chloride is granular and should hence be used only as packed
in small bags or columns, which causes problems when used in 
a narrow space such as in refrigerators.Also known is a process of permitting a honeycomb shaped
activated carbon to carry palladium chloride. With this
process, it is difficult to permit the honeycomb activated
carbon as the carrier, having a low strength and small
specific surface area, to carry a large amount of palladium
chloride, and hence a high-activity palladium chloride-carrying
activated carbon cannot be obtained. There are
still other problems, i.e. honeycomb activated carbon is
expensive and the palladium chloride-carrying honeycomb
activated carbon requires forced ventilation with a fan or
the like.Let us consider the case where a freshness keeping system
is, for example, used for a refrigerator. If the system
requires, like in the case of conventional deodorizing
systems, circulation of whole gases present in the refrigerator,
an additional fan should be mounted and, at the same
time, the catalytic activity for decomposing ethylene will
sometimes markedly decrease due to adsorption of toxic gases
generated from other foods. In order to achieve the object
of keeping freshness more effectively, it is better to
remove ethylene present in the very local part where it
generates, such as a vegetables and fruits section in the
refrigerator. This object cannot be
