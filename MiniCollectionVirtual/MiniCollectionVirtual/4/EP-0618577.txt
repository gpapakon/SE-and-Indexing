<ABSTRACT>
In a recording and reproducing apparatus for 
inputting recording data (S1) into a predetermined recording 

and reproducing means, outputting as reproducing data (S15), 
when record assurance is conducted by comparing the 

recording data with the reproduced data, an error 
detection code is calculated for the recording data, 

and the error detection code is compared with the error 
detection code which is obtained from the reproduced 

data by a predetermined comparison means (33), thereby 
allowing the volume of information to be transmitted 

from the recording system to the comparison means to be 
considerably reduced. Therefore, the capacity of the 

delay memory (32) for delaying the error detection code 
which is calculated from the recording data for the 

portion of the processing time in the recording and 
reproducing means can be considerably reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording and
reproducing apparatus, and can be applied to a
recording and reproducing apparatus in which, for
example, a recording error is detected when video data
is recorded.As this kind of recording and reproducing
apparatus, a digital video tape recorder (DVTR) shown
in Fig. 1 has been proposed. That is, in Fig. 1, 1
generally shows DVTR. An input digital video signal S1
inputted from a predetermined video signal generation
unit is inputted to a shuffling circuit 2. The
shuffling circuit 2 divides digital video data which is
inputted as a digital video signal into discrete cosine
transform (DCT) blocks of 8 columns by 4 rows for each
field, and then gathers ten blocks of this DCT block
from separate positions in the screen respectively, and
transmits them to the following DCT transform circuit 3
as the shuffled data S2. The DCT transform circuit 3 carries out discrete
cosine transform on each DCT block data, and transmits
this to the following quantization circuit 4 as a DCT
data S3.The quantization circuit 4 checks the quantization
level for realizing the target rate of compression
based on the data-length information which is fed back
from a variable-length coding circuit 5, compresses the
information volume by quantizing the DCT data S3 based
on the quantization level, and then transmits this to
the following variable-length coding circuit 5 as a
quantized data S4. The variable-length coding circuit
5 variable-length codes the quantized data S4,
generates a variable-length coded data S5 which is
fixed a block-length in format, and transmits this to
an error-correction outer-code circuit 6 and a delay
memory 12.An error correction outer-code is added in the
error-correction outer-code circuit 6 for correcting
errors generated in burst form, and moreover, in the
following error-correction inner-code circuit 7, an
error correction inner-code for correcting a random
error, synchronous pattern, ID code, etc., are added.
Then, the 8-bit parallel data is converted into the 1-bit 
serial data with a clock frequency 8 times that of
the parallel data, and transmitted to a recording
circuit 8 to generate a recording data S8. A recording
current is applied to a recording head 10 mounted on a
rotary drum through a rotary transformer 9, and the
recording data S8 is recorded on a magnetic tape 11.As shown in Fig. 2, in the rotary drum 28, a pair
of reproducing heads 15 are mounted apart from a pair
of recording heads 10 by 90 degrees, respectively.
This rotary drum 28 is rotated in
