<ABSTRACT>
A flexible PVC moulding composition having reduced tendency toward plate-out during conversion into films, injection mouldings or extrusion articles contains, in addition to a vinyl chloride polymer and the plasticiser, a copolymer of C24-C60- alpha -olefins, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid with aliphatic C1-C6-monoalcohols and optionally styrene, 3-methylstyrene, 4-methylstyrene or  alpha -methylstyrene. It is distinguished by the fact that, compared with other suitable moulding compositions, it has a particularly low exudation tendency. Stoppage times for cleaning of the processing machines thus occur to a lesser extent, and the quality of the resultant products is improved.
