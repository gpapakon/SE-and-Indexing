<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for monitoring an anti-theft component of a vehicle with a remote-control access system. It also relates to an anti-theft component thus constituted. According to the invention, a false key (1) makes it possible to operate a commutator (2) for starting and sequential supplying of the accessories of the vehicle. A procedure for deactivation or activation of the anti-theft component is executed, in dialogue (6, 7) with a module (5) for interrogating an RF tag (7), using an anti-theft unit (4) which actuates a motorised anti-theft system (13) and an electromagnet (11) for blocking the anti-theft system in the event of an unauthorised attempt at starting.

A method of controlling a vehicle anti-theft means,
or a device of the same kind, with a remote control

access system (5, 7), the anti-theft means including an

anti-theft component (13) and a central anti-theft
control unit (4), the anti-theft means including in

particular a switch (2, 22) for the control of starting
and of the supply of electrical power to the

accessories of the vehicle, characterised by the fact
that,

in a de-activated phase (S1) of the anti-theft means,
the user:


accesses (S1-1) the vehicle with a remote control
unit; and
manoeuvres (S1-2) the switch (2, 22), the said
manoeuvre reproducing the usual manipulations of

mechanical keys; and then the central anti-theft
control unit (4);
detects (S1-3) a predetermined position of the switch
(2, 22) so as to produce (S1-4) an interrogation for

identifying a demand to unlock the anti-theft component
(13), by exchanging signals with the access system (5,

7) by remote control;
produces (S1-5), in response, an order to activate
successive positions of the switch (2, 22) and an order

to unlock the anti-theft component (13);
 
then, in an active phase (S2) of the anti-theft means,

the central anti-theft control unit (4) :

detects (S2-1) a manoeuvre for activation of the
anti-theft means on the switch (2, 22), the said

manoeuvre reproducing the usual manipulations of
mechanical keys;
activates (S2-1) the anti-theft means by producing an
order for locking of the anti-theft component (13);
de-activates (S2-3) the successive positions of the
switch (2, 22).
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the manoeuvre (S1-2) of the switch (2, 22)

includes a phase in the course of which introduction of
a key (1) into the switch (2, 22) is simulated, the

said phase being realised by a movement in translation,
and a phase in the course of which starting of the

vehicle and the supply of power to its accessories are
executed in succession.
A method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that, after the switch (2, 22) has

been manoeuvred, it consists in emitting a sequence of
interrogation by waves, so as to detect the presence of

a key (1) or contactless badge (7), and then, where
detection is positive, in emitting an order for

unlocking the anti-theft component (13).
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in
that it consists, in the event of failure of the user

to be recognised by the interrogation sequence, in
blocking the de-activating procedure after at least one

attempt at de-activation, in emitting an alarm, and/or 
in recording in a memory the circumstances of the

refusal to de-activate.
An anti-theft means for an object such as a
vehicle, according to Claim 1, comprising:


an interrogating-receiving module (5) for a badge
such as a badge (7) of a keyless system for accessing

the vehicle, especially of the radio frequency (RF)
type,
a switch (2, 22) for starting the vehicle and for
supplying power to its accessories,
a motorised anti-theft component (13),
a central anti-theft control unit (4) comprising, in
particular, a central unit (21) connected to the

foregoing elements in such a way as to perform the
method of the invention according to at least one of

the preceding Claims;

characterised in that it includes a key (1) for
manoeuvring the switch (2, 22) and cooperating with the

badge of the keyless system for accessing the vehicle.
A means according to Claim 5, characterised in that
the key (1) consists of a rotor (61) having a

prehensile part in the form of a leading element which
projects outside the switch.
A means according to Claim 5 or Claim 6,
characterised in that it includes a first interruptor

(27; 66, 66') for detecting insertion of the key (1),
and a second interruptor (28; 63) for detecting 

rotation of the key in the switch, whereby to supply
power sequentially to the accessories of the vehicle.
A means according to Claim 7, characterised in that
the first interruptor (27) consists of two conductive

leaves (66, 66') which are brought together into mutual
contact during introduction of the key (1).
A means according to Claim 5, characterised in that
it includes means for detection of the locked or

unlocked state of the anti-theft component (13),
including a first interruptor (M1) and a second

interruptor (M2) which are manoeuvred by the motorised
anti-theft component (13) and which are connected,

firstly to the central anti-theft control unit (4, 21),
and secondly to power supply circuits (45, 53) for a

means for blocking the anti-theft means (48) and for a
motor (54) which mobilises a latch (71, 72) of the

anti-theft component (13).
A means according to Claim 9, characterised in
that the means for detecting the locked or unlocked

state of the anti-theft component (13) further include
two Hall effect sensors (H1, H2) which are connected to

the central control unit (21) for informing it of the
state of the motorised anti-theft component (13).
A means according to one of Claims 5 to 10,
characterised in that the anti-theft module comprises a

central unit (21) the input ports of which are
connected (30) to a contact (O) of the first

interruptor (27) of the switch (22), (36, 39, 40) to
the successive contacts (34 - 37) of the second

interruptor (28) of the switch (22), (57, 58) to the
Hall effect sensors (H1, H2) for detecting the locked 

or unlocked state of the anti-theft component, the
outputs (49, 50) of the central unit being connected to

the inputs of a two-way current supply circuit (53)
connected to the terminals of the motor (54) of the

anti-theft component (13), the central unit being
connected through a two-way bus (41) to a central unit

(42) serving as an on-board computer for exchanging
information as to their reciprocal states, and through

a two-way line (25) to the read-write module (24) of
the RF badge.
