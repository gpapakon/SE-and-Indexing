<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relate to a sanitary tampon comprising a compact applicator and a tampon (3) of compressed absorbent material stored within the applicator, the applicator having an inner tube (1) and an outer tube (2) slidably disposed over the inner tube (1). The outer tube (2) has a distal discharge end (4) for insertion into the body of the user. The tampon (3) is solid and substantially cylindrical in shape and is constructed such that at least a part of the body (11) of the tampon (3) adjacent the proximal end (13) sits at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the applicator so that when the inner tube (1) is withdrawn past the proximal end (13) of the tampon (3) to prime the applicator for use, the proximal end (13) of the tampon will urge itself against the inner surface of the outer tube (2) and when the inner tube (1) is pushed back into the outer tube (2) to expel the tampon, the tampon is hindered from re-entering the distal end (6) of the inner tube (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sanitary 
tampons which comprise an applicator for placing a 
tampon in position within the body of a user of the 
tampon. It is known to provide applicators in which an 
outer tube for storing a tampon therein has a distal 
discharge end for insertion into the body and the 
tampon is ejected by slidably moving an inner tube 
within the outer tube. In order to provide less bulky applicators, a 
number of arrangements have been proposed in which 
the inner tube is initially received telescopically 
within the outer tube and must be partially withdrawn 
before the dispensing operation. Such an arrangement 
is known as a "compact applicator". However, it has 
been found in compact applicators that once the inner 
tube has been partially withdrawn and the applicator 
is primed for use, the inner tube will often pass 
back between the tampon and the inner surface of the 
outer tube when the user pushes the inner tube 
inwards to discharge the tampon into the body. When 
this occurs, the inner tube will simply relocate 
itself between the tampon and the outer tube without 
discharging the tampon - this effect is often 
referred to as "re-tubing". In International patent 
WO-A-91/06272, the applicants proposed a 
tampon applicator which aimed to overcome the problem 
of "re-tubing". However, this applicator made use of 
a complex slot and protruding tab arrangement between 
the inner and outer tubes. In order to manufacture  
 
the applicator, complicated tooling is required and 
the fact that the inner tube has to be placed in a 
specific orientation within the outer tube makes 
automated assembly difficult. A further 
characteristic of this applicator is that if the user 
tries to discharge the tampon from the outer tube 
without first partially withdrawing the inner tube to 
prime the applicator for use, the inner tube can be 
freed from the outer tube by disengaging the tab 
which is intended to lock the inner and outer tubes 
together. If the inner tube is then partially 
withdrawn from the outer tube, there is no means to 
prevent complete withdrawal. These problems can be 
inconvenient. Therefore, successful operation relies 
heavily on the use of reading and understanding the 
instructions provided. US-A-4,726,805 also describes tampon 
applicators which are intended to overcome the 
problem of "re-tubing". The applicators are made 
from a deformable/flexible material such as a 
thermoforming plastic to ensure that the product 
functions correctly. Accordingly, the

<CLAIMS>
A sanitary tampon comprising a compact 
applicator and a tampon (3) of compressed absorbent 

material stored within the applicator, the applicator 
having an inner tube (1) and an outer tube (2) 

slidably disposed over the inner tube (1), the outer 
tube (2) having a distal discharge end (4) for 

insertion into the body of the user wherein the 
tampon (3) is solid and substantially cylindrical in 

shape, characterised in that the tampon (3) is 
constructed such that at least a part of the body of 

the tampon adjacent the proximal end (13) always sits 
at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the 

applicator so that when the inner tube (1) is 
withdrawn past the proximal end (13) of the tampon 

(3) to prime the applicator for use, the proximal end 
(13) of the tampon (3) will urge itself against the 

inner surface of the outer tube (2) and when the 
inner tube (1) is pushed back into the outer tube (2) 

to expel the tampon (3), the tampon (3) is hindered 
from re-entering the distal end (6) of the inner tube 

(1). 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in Claim 1 
wherein the outer surface of the tampon body (11) is 

provided with a projection (15a) which causes the 
body (11) of the tampon (3) to sit at an angle to the 

longitudinal axis of the applicator. 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in Claim 1 
wherein the tampon body (11) is curved below the 

distal end (12). 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in Claim 1 
wherein the tampon body (11) is slanted with respect  

 
to its distal end (12). 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in Claim 1 
wherein the longitudinal axis of the tampon body (11) 

is not coincident with that of the tampon head (12). 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in Claim 1 
wherein the outer surface of the tampon body (11) is 

provided with an indentation (15b). 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein the distal end of the tampon 

has an enlarged head (12), part of which sits 
coaxially with respect to the longitudinal axis of 

the applicator. 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in Claim 7 
wherein the widest part of the enlarged head (12a) 

sits firmly within the distal end (4) of the outer 
tube (2) to anchor the head (12) such that the axis 

of the tampon body (11) is not co-axial with that of 
the applicator. 
A sanitary tampon in any preceding claim 
wherein the outer (2) and inner tubes are provided 

with means (5,10) to limit withdrawal of the inner 
tube (1) from the outer tube (2). 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in Claim 9 
wherein the proximal end (5) of the outer tube (2) is 

cupped inwardly and the outer surface of the distal 
end (6) of the inner tube (1) is provided with a rim 

(10) which abuts the proximal end (5) of the outer 
tube (2) to limit withdrawal.  

 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein the distal end (6) of the 

inner tube (1) is cupped inwardly. 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in any 
preceding claim, wherein the proximal end (13) of the 

tampon (3) is enlarged. 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein the length of the applicator 

before preparation for use is no 
greater than the length of the tampon (3). 
A sanitary tampon as claimed in any 
preceding claim, wherein the tampon (3) comprises a 

compressed fibrous cellulosic absorbent material.
