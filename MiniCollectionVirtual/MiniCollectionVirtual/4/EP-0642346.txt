<ABSTRACT>
A solid, storage-stable, germicidal, pre-iodine composition comprises in dry admixture with each other, a solid oxy-compound of iodine, a solid reducing agent for the oxy-compound of iodine, and a solid desiccant used in amount sufficient to combine during the storage cycle of the composition with ambient and/or endogenous water. The oxy-compounds of iodine are iodic acid, iodine pentoxide, potassium iodate and sodium iodate. Preferred reducing agents are ascorbic acid, dihydroxy fumaric acid, the thiol sugars and cysteine. A preferred combination desiccant and iodine solvating agent is polyvinyl pyrrolidone having a molecular weight of from 10,000 to 1,000,000. The composition is storage-stable for an indefinite period. Upon the addition of water, the oxy-compound of iodine is reduced to nascent iodine, which, in application, serves its well-known germicidal function.

<DESCRIPTION>
SOLID, STORAGE-STABLE, GERMICIDAL, PRE-IODINE COMPOSITION This invention relates to germicidal pre-iodine compositions, i.e. to compositions containing iodine in precursor form. Upon the addition of water, the compositions have the capacity of generating nascent iodine useful as a germicide.BACKGROUND AND GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION Although a wide variety of highly effective, aqueous, iodine-containing germicidal solutions are known and extensively used against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, their commercial application is attended by certain disadvantages inherent in the chemical nature of their principal component, iodine.In the first place, since iodine is volatile, iodine-containing germicides in the form of either powders or solutions tend to lose iodine by sublimation and evaporation. Accordingly, the germicides are characterized by shelf lives of restricted duration.In the second place, because of its extreme activity, the iodine tends to react with other ingredients of any aqueous germicidal composition in which it is contained, causing the composition to lose germicidal activity. By-products of such reactions, notably hydriodic acid, compound the problem because of their own per se chemical activity.The general problem with the available aqueous iodine germicidal preparations is their instability; slowly but inexorably iodine in solution oxidizes the solvating co-ingredients such as ethanol in Tincture of Iodine, polyvinylpyrollidone in Betadine, and ethyleneoxides and alcohols in nonionic detergents such as escodine.The iodide generated by these reactions ultimately forms the triiodide ion which will not penetrate microbial cell walls. It therefore is ineffective as a 

germicide.Furthermore, iodine preparation such as those listed above cannot be co-mingled with other materials such as phenols and quaternary ammonium detergent germicides, or other chemically reactive substances. If so co-mingled, the undesirable degenerative reactions noted above occur and destroy the expected benefit of the co-mingling materials.It has been proposed (Van Allen U.S. 1.661,640) to overcome the foregoing problem by preparing, storing and dispensing the iodophor in the form of a dry hygroscopic powder and then, just before the iodophor is to be applied, adding water to form the active germicidal solution. The problem with this proposed routine is that the iodine compounds contained in the dry iodophor are extremely sensitive to the presence of water. The degradative reactions noted above are
