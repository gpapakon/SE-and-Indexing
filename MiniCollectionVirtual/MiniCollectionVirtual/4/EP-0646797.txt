<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for judging the rotation of a motor, and an apparatus for confirming motor stop using this circuit. 
Threshold value is judged by the use of a fail-safe two-input window comparator by inputting a signal from a rotation 

sensor for detecting the rotation of a motor. More specifically, a predetermined threshold value range (window) is 
set to each of the terminals of the window comparator. When the sensor and the judgement circuit are normal and, 

moreover, the motor is at halt, a signal level inputted to each terminal is within the range of the window, and the 
window comparator outputs a logical value "1". When the sensor or the judgement circuit is out of order, the signal 

level of one of the input terminals is out of the range of the window, and thus the comparator output is logic 0. 
When the motor is rotating, the signal level of the other input terminal is out of the range of the window, so that the 

comparator output is logic 0. In this way, the stop state of the motor can be distinguished from its inertial rotation, 
and can be detected reliably.

<DESCRIPTION>
A first aspect of the present invention relates to a motor rotation
judgement circuit for reliably distinguishing between a motor stopped condition
and a motor rotation condition (including rotation due to inertia). Moreover, a
second aspect of the present invention relates to a fail-safe motor stopped
verification apparatus using such judgement circuit for verifying that the motor
has stopped rotating.Heretofore, to ensure safety when using motor driven apparatus, it has
been necessary to have a detection device which can detect a sudden
unintentional start up of a stopped motor and give a warning.An example of this is the monitoring to ensure that a movable portion of
a robot does not suddenly move due to electrical noise when the robot is in a
hold condition (a temporary stop condition instructed by the controller program)
as reported by Sugimoto et al. in; Transactions of the Japan Society of
Mechanical Engineers Vol. 56-C, No. 530 (1990-10), and also disclosed by K.
Futsuhara, N. Sugimoto, M. Mukaidono et al. in; Proceedings of the Second
International Conference on Human Aspects of Advanced Manufacturing and
Hybrid Automation, Honolulu, USA (Aug. 1990) in a paper entitled, "A Method
of Constructing Safety Device with Consideration of Noise-Induced Errors".
Also at the same conference in Honolulu, M. Kato et. al proposed in a paper
entitled "Construction of Magnetic Sensors for Assuring Safety", a method for
verifying that motor rotation has stopped, by monitoring for current flowing in
the motor during the robot hold condition. Moreover, the 1959 Japan Industrial Robot Manufacturers Association
Report points out that such accidents have actually occurred, and there is
concern that these are on the increase.With the apparatus for verifying that motor rotation has stopped
disclosed in the abovementioned papers, with the case of M. Kato et. al, it is
stated that, "when electricity is supplied to the motor, this is equivalent to when
the motor is rotating[?]", while in the paper of N. Sugimoto et. al., a mechanical
construction is adopted wherein an arm is attached to a rotation shaft of the
motor, and any movement of the arm while the motor is stopped is detected by
means of a limit switch.The former case has a weakness in that the rotation of the motor cannot
actually be detected when the rotor (rotating element of the motor ) is rotating
under inertia, with the power supply to the motor shut off.Moreover, with the latter case, in order that when the motor is running,
the limit switch is not
