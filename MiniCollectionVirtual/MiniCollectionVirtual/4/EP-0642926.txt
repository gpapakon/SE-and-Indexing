<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing the heat-sensitive sheet 
suitable for the production of a stencil 

is described which is a simple process, makes it possible to 
readily form a porous substrate layer having a good fiber 

dispersibility on a thermoplastic resin film without 
intervening any adhesive layer and allows to carry out a 

single production line from beginning to end. The process 
comprises: a process characterized by dispersing polyester 

binder fibers on the surface of a thermoplastic resin film 
by an electrostatic flocking process, thermally compressing 

so as to form a porous substrate layer on a heat-sensitive sheet; another 
process comprises electrostatically flocking polyester binder fibers 

on the surface of a releasing member, then superimposing a 
thermoplastic resin film on the fibers-flocked surface on 

the releasing member, thermally compressing the superimposed 
film, and removing the releasing member to obtain a 

heat-sensitive sheet; and another process 
characterized by electrostatically flocking polyester binder 

fibers on the surface of a thermoplastic resin film and 
thermally compressing the fibers-flocked film to form a 

porous substrate layer on the thermoplastic resin film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing a heat-sensitive stencil sheet. Specifically, 
it relates to a process for producing 
a heat-sensitive stencil sheet, which has a porous substrate 
layer having a good fiber dispersibility and in which no 
adhesive layer resides. In the prior art, a heat-sensitive stencil sheet is generally 
produced by adhering a thermoplastic resin film on a porous 
substrate such as a porous thin sheet with an adhesive. 
For example, one surface of an original and a resin film of 
a heat-sensitive stencil sheet are brought into contact with 
each other and irradiated by light from the side of the 
porous substrate of the heat-sensitive stencil sheet in 
order to generate heat at the black image portion of the 
original, thereby the heat-sensitive stencil sheet being 
engraved either by melting and perforating the film of the 
heat-sensitive stencil sheet with the aid of the generated 
heat or by reading the original image by an image sensor and 
then by melting and perforating the film of the 
heat-sensitive stencil sheet corresponding to the original 
image by means of a thermal head. The pictorial property of 
the printed matter obtained by using such a heat-sensitive  
 
stencil sheet is, however, influenced not only by the perforating 
property of the heat-sensitive stencil sheet but also by the 
fiber dispersibility in the substrate. Since an adhesive layer is, however, presented between the 
film and the substrate in the prior art heat-sensitive stencil 
sheet described above, it has the disadvantage that the 
perforating property is obstructed. It is also difficult from 
the standpoint of strength to prepare a porous substrate having 
a low fiber density and a good fiber dispersibility. 
Furthermore, since the heat-sensitive stencil sheet of the prior 
art is produced by once preparing a porous substrate and then by 
laminating a film on the resulting substrate, the process is 
complicated and there is the problem that the heat-sensitive 
stencil sheet could not be prepared by using a single production 
line from beginning to end. JP-A-62-184888 discloses a process for producing a thermal 
stencil sheet in which a tissue paper comprising at least 30% of 
conjugate fibers is laminated using an adhesive with a high 
molecular weight resin film. JP-A-63-328778 discloses a process for flocking short fibers 
on a thermoplastic resin film. In the disclosed process short 
fibers are electrostatically flocked onto a thermoplastic film 
which is in a thermally
