photographic light-sensitive material comprising a support and 

provided thereon, a blue-sensitive emulsion layer containing 
previously unfogged internal latent image-forming silver 

halide grains having a spectral sensitivity to blue-light, a

layer containing previously unfogged internal latent image-forming 
silver halide grains having a spectral sensitivity to 

red-light and a hydrophilic colloidal layer, wherein said 
blue-sensitive emulsion layer is provided so as to be located 

farther than both said green-sensitive and said red-sensitive 
emulsion layers from the support; and at least one of said 

blue-sensitive emulsion layer, said-green sensitive emulsion 
layer and said red-sensitive emulsion layer or said 

hydrophilic colloidal layer contains an internal latent image 
forming silver halide grains having a spectral sensitivity 

having a part common to the respective spectral sensitivity 
regions pertaining to said blue-sensitive emulsion layer, said 

green-sensitive emulsion layer and said red-sensitive emulsion 
layer; and said spectral sensitivity of said blue-sensitive 

emulsion layer to said blue-light, is not less than 0.8 of at  
 

least one selected from a spectral sensitivity of said green-sensitive 
emulsion layer to said blue-light or a spectral 

sensitivity of said red-sensitive emulsion layer to blue-light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a direct positive silver 
halide color photographic light-sensitive material comprising 
internal latent image-forming silver halide grains, and more 
particularly to a direct positive silver halide color photographic 
light-sensitive material suitably usable for preparing 
a color proof image from plural black-and-white halftone images 
that can be obtained by color separation and halftone image 
conversion in the color graphic-arts/printing process. In a method for preparing a color proof by using a silver 
halide color photographic light-sensitive material having a 
white support, a plural number of different black-and-white 
halftone images obtained by color separation and halftone image 
conversion from a colored original are printed in sequence on  
 
a single color photographic paper in the contact printing 
manner, and the printed photographic paper is subjected to 
color-development to get the couplers contained therein to produce 
imagewise dyes to thereby form a color image for use as a 
color proof. In the above technique, however, when on the color proof 
a color image is formed so as to get closely akin to the color 
image of the original, the black image density on the color 
proof lacks as compared to the original's, whereas when the 
proof's black image density is made so as to have a close 
resemblance to the original's, the proof's resemblance to the 
color image of the original is deteriorated, and thus it is 
very difficult to satisfy the reproductions of both at the same 
time. As a means to solve the above disadvantage there is known 
a technique to provide besides the yellow, magenta and cyan 
color forming layers a fourth black layer different in the 
spectral sensitivity from any of the three layers; for example, 
Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection (hereinafter 
abbreviated to JP O.P.I.) No. 122637/1991 discloses a 
technique to use four different image-forming layers: yellow, 
magenta, cyan and black image-forming layers. JP O.P.I. Nos. 
289846/1990 and 183251/1990 also disclose techniques for 
improving the above problem. These techniques, however, have 
such shortcomings that they have need of increasing the number  
 
of exposures, resulting in a loss of productivity, or lack the 
image stability, and therefore, they need further improvements 
in order to be provided for practical use. JP O.P.I. No. 100352/1993 discloses a technique to use a 
silver halide emulsion (hereinafter referred to as a panchromatic 
emulsion)
