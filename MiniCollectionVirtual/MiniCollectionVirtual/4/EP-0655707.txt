<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor laser 
exposure device which enables a plurality of beam 
exposures to occur by arranging a plurality of laser 
beams to overlap each other utilising semiconductor 
lasers. In conventional semiconductor laser exposure 
devices, the system adopted is a one laser beam exposure 
system, wherein one laser beam is emitted on to either a 
silver chloride film rolled around a drum or on to a 
plate roll coated with photosensitive film, where the 
main scanning process (rotation) is conducted on to the 
drum or the produced roll and at the same time the laser 
beam conducts sub-scanning (linear movement) along the 
drum; however, such conventional system requires a long 
exposure time. By increasing the number of laser beams, the 
time required for exposure will be reduced to a few 
tenths or fractions compared to having only one laser 
beam, and therefore one may consider increasing the 
number of laser beams using beam splitters. However, 
compared to argon-neon gas lasers, semiconductor lasers 
have a far weaker beam energy, and so it is not possible 
to transmit the beam through beam splitters. Thus one 
may consider mounting a plurality of semiconductor 
lasers in a row; however, the arranged space of the 
semiconductor lasers would be too large, and there has 
not been any proposals of how to arrange the laser beams 
to have them overlap one another. This invention has for an object the provision  
 
of a semiconductor laser exposure device whereby 
utilising semiconductor lasers, a plurality of laser 
beams can overlap little by little with adjacent laser 
beams and a plurality of laser beam exposures can be 
conducted by transferring the emission direction of the 
said laser beams to the direction parallel to and 
crossing the arranged row of the beams and thus greatly 
reduce the time required for exposure. According to the present invention there is 
provided a semiconductor laser exposure device, said 
device having a scanning table on which are mounted a 
plurality of semiconductor lasers which emit laser beams 
on to an exposed object W, which lasers are mounted in 
a row to enable the laser beams to be emitted in 
parallel, a plurality of optical fibers the number 
thereof being the same as the number of said 
semiconductor lasers, being placed opposing the 
semiconducting lasers with one end of the optical fibers 
being lined up sideways in a row to match the space 
between each semiconductor laser so that the optical 
fibers can introduce the laser beams
