<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a modulation amplifier (1) comprising a signal converter (2), a summer (5) and a plurality of r.f. stages (31-m or 41-n). The r.f. stages (31-m) are triggered by equal-phase control signals (s1-m) and the r.f. stages (41-n) by control signals (t1-n) of different phase ( phi 1-n). The r.f. stages (31-m or 41-n) can be triggered as desired by the control signals (s1-m or t1-n). The summer adds the high-frequency output signals (x1-m or y1-n) of the r.f. stages (31-m et 41-n). The output signal may, for example, be transmitted further to a low-pass and a subsequent load. The phases ( phi 1-n) of the output signals (y1-n) of the r.f. stages (41-n) correspond to those of the control signals (t1-m). As many r.f. stages (31-m) are triggered as required to produce a high-frequency oscillation at the summer output, the amplitude of which changes stepwise in accordance with the l.f. signal (LF). In addition, as many r.f. stages (41-n) are triggered at different phases ( phi 1-n) as required for the sum of the output signals (y1-n) to correspond to the difference between the increased amplitude of the l.f. signal (LF) and the rough approximation of the l.f. signal (LF) by the sum of the output signals (x1-m).
