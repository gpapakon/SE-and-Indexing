<ABSTRACT>
Either one of a facsimile mode to function as 
a facsimile apparatus and a printer mode to function 

as a printer is indicated by a mode selection switch, 
and when a facsimile signal is received in the printer 

mode, the facsimile mode is automatically set. When 
a signal is received from an external equipment such 

as a computer in the facsimile mode, the printer mode 
is automatically set but the switching to the printer 

mode is inhibited if unprinted received data is stored 
in an image memory. 
When data is not supplied from the external 
equipment for a predetermined time period in the 

printer mode, the facsimile mode is set.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
recording apparatus operable in a mode to receive image
data transmitted from a sending station and record it
and a mode to record data sent from an external
information processing apparatus, and a mode switching
method in such an apparatus.As computer equipments are advanced, a plurality
of printers, copying machines and facsimile machines
connected to various computer equipments are installed
in an office. Where such a number of equipments are
installed, a space required therefor is not negligible
and the installation of higher performance equipments
and the sharing of functions are desired.For example, a facsimile apparatus has a
copying function and it has been known that it may
perform the function of a copying machine. In general,
the facsimile is not used but in a stand-by state in
most parts of a day except in an office which
exceptionally receives many facsimile transmissions.
On the other hand, the printer connected to the computer
equipment is also not much occupied when viewed over a
long period, although there is a difference in the 
operation times. Accordingly, a facsimile machine which
has both functions of the printer mode and the facimile
mode is desired.Where the facsimile machine has the both functions
and a user switched the mode by a switch as required, if
the user fails to switch back to the facsimile mode after
the use in the printer mode, the reception of the
facsimile is disabled for a long time period.European Patent Specification No. EP-A-0519253
discloses a facsimile apparatus also capable of printing
data received from a PC. Japanese Patent Abstract No.
JP-A-63 212557 discloses a printer which has a facsimile
communication function and which operates preferentially
when receiving facsimile data.Neither of these prior disclosures provides a
solution to the above problem.It is a concern of the present invention to provide
an improved image recording apparatus and a mode
switching method in such an apparatus.It is another concern of the present invention to
provide an image recording apparatus which is operable
in a mode to record data transmitted from a sending
station and a mode to record data from an external
information processing apparatus and has an excellent
operability, and a mode switching method in such an
apparatus.In accordance with a first aspect of the present 
invention there is printed an image recording apparatus
as set out in claim 1.In accordance with a second aspect of the invention
there is provided a method as set
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image recording apparatus operable in a facsimile
mode to receive data transmitted by a sending station via

a line and a printer mode to record data sent from an
external host computer apparatus comprising:


setting means (206) for setting either said
facsimile mode or said printer mode;
storage means (RAM3) for storing the received data
from the sending station in said facsimile mode and

storing the data from the external host computer
apparatus in said printer mode, and
record means (6) for recording an image on a
recording medium in accordance with the data stored in

said storage means,

   characterised by further comprising:

control means (CPU1) for controlling the setting of
said printer mode by said setting means in accordance

with whether or not unrecorded data transmitted from the
sending station is stored in said storage means,
said control means inhibiting the setting of said
printer mode when there is unrecorded data transmitted

from the sending station stored in said storage means and
permitting the setting of said printer mode when there

is no unrecorded data transmitted from the sending
station stored in said storage means.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, further comprising 
switching means for automatically switching to said

facsimile mode after the completion of the recording in
said printer mode.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein
said setting means includes manually operable switching

means (206).
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein
said setting means monitors the input of a first start

signal for starting the operation in said facsimile mode,
and set said facsimile mode when said first start signal

is applied.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein
said setting means monitors the input of a second start

signal for starting the operation in said printer mode,
and sets said printer mode when said second start signal

is applied.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, further
comprising initialization means for initializing said

facsimile mode when power to the apparatus is turned on.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said record means includes a recording head for

discharging ink droplets in accordance with data and 
drive means for driving a recording medium relative to

said recording head.
Apparatus according to claim 6 wherein said
recording head discharges the ink droplets by causing a

change of state of ink by using thermal energy.
A mode switching method for use in an image recording apparatus operable in a
facsimile mode to receive data transmitted from a sending

station via a line and a printer mode to record data sent
from an external host computer apparatus,

the method comprising:

a first step of inputting a switching request from
the facsimile mode to the printer mode;
a second step of determining if unrecorded data
received from the sending station is stored in storage

means when the switching request is inputted in said
first step, the storage means storing the data

transmitted from the sending station in the facsimile
mode and storing the data from the external host computer

apparatus in the printer mode; and
a third step of controlling the switching to the
printer mode in accordance with the decision in said

second step, such that said third step inhibits the
switching to the printer mode when said second step

determines that there is unrecorded data transmitted from
the sending station stored in the storage means and 

permits the switching to the printer mode when there is
not unrecorded data transmitted from the sending station

stored in said storage means.
A method according to Claim 9, wherein said third
step inhibits the switching to the printer mode when said

second step determines that the data transmitted from the
sending station is stored in the storage means.
A method according to Claim 9 or Claim 10, wherein
said first step inputs the switching request from the

facsimile mode to the printer mode by manually operable
switching means.
A method according to any one of Claims 9 to 11,
wherein said first step inputs the switching request from

the facsimile mode to the printer mode by a start signal
for starting an operation in the printer mode.
A method according to any one of claims 9 to 12,
further comprising a step, prior to said first step, of

setting the facsimile mode upon power-on.
A method according to any one of claims 9 to 13,
further comprising a step of switching the mode to the

facsimile mode upon completion of the recording operation
