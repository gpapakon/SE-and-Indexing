<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for an actuating unit for a hydraulic vehicle braking installation which consists of a vacuum brake servo (1) and a master brake cylinder (2). In order to transfer the reactive forces generated when the master cylinder (2) is actuated to a coachwork bulkhead (45) supporting the actuating unit (1, 2), there is a centrally fitted force transmission component which is arranged to operate between the master cylinder (2) and the bulkhead (45). According to the invention, this force transmission unit takes the form of a through bolt (14) which extends axially through the control housing (8) of the vacuum brake servo (1).

An actuating unit for a hydraulic brake system for automotive 
vehicles including a pneumatic brake power booster (1), which 

is preferably a vacuum brake power booster, and a master 
brake cylinder (2) inserted after the brake power booster in 

terms of effect, the brake power booster (1) including a 
booster housing (3), the interior of which is subdivided into 

two chambers (6,7) by a movable wall (5) which is attached to 
a control housing (8) accommodating a control valve (9), and 

a centrally arranged force-transmitting element being 
provided which is in force-transmitting connection with the 

master brake cylinder (2), on the one hand, and a vehicle 
body wall (45) of the automotive vehicle, on the other hand,
characterised
 in that the force-transmitting 
element is a continuous bolt (14) which extends in an axial 

direction through the control housing (8). 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 1, the control valve of 
the brake power booster being operable by means of a valve 

piston which interacts with an actuating pedal,
characterised
 in that the valve piston (15), 
having a sleeve-shaped design, is guided on the bolt (14) 

and, with its end, is supported at the actuating pedal (30). 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, the brake 
power booster including an elastic reaction disc which is 

arranged in the control housing and permits transmitting the 
output force of the brake power booster to the piston by 

means of a pressure plate that is in force-transmitting 
connection with a piston guided in the master brake cylinder,
characterised
 in that the reaction disc (13) and  
 

the pressure plate (26) have an annular design and are 
positioned coaxially relative to the bolt (14) on a sleeve 

(25) which is slidably guided on the bolt (14). 
An actuating unit as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised
 in that the output force is 
transmitted to the piston (29) by means of at least two rod-shaped 

elements (18,19) which are arranged symmetrically in 
parallel to the bolt (14) between the piston (29) and the 

pressure plate (26). 
An actuating unit as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised
 in that the output force is 
transmitted to the piston (29) by means of a bolt-shaped 

element (33), which is guided in a hollow-cylindrical section 
(34) of the bolt (14) having radially opposed slots (35,36), 

and which is in axial abutment against a pin (37) positioned 
perpendicularly in the pressure plate (26). 
An actuating unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims,
characterised
 in that the end of the bolt (14), 
which is associated with the master brake cylinder (2), is 

connected to a closure element (38) closing the master brake 
cylinder (2) towards the outside. 
An actuating unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 5,
characterised
 in that the end of the bolt (14) 
associated with the master brake cylinder (2) is connected to 

a bowl-shaped part (40), in which the end of the master brake  
 

cylinder housing (2) projecting into the booster housing (3) 
is received, and is connected to the booster housing half 

(20) close to the master cylinder. 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 7,
characterised
 in that the bowl-shaped part (40) 
has a radial collar (41) which serves to fasten the part (40) 

to the booster housing (3), on the one hand, and, on the 
other hand, serves as an abutment for a resetting spring (39) 

biassing the movable wall (5) in opposition to the actuating 
direction. 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 7,
characterised
 in that the bowl-shaped part (40) 
is formed in one part with the booster housing half (20) 

close to the master cylinder. 
An actuating unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims,
characterised
 in that the actuating pedal (30) 
is of fork-shaped design and includes two parallel arms (42, 

43) spaced from each other, the bolt (14) extending between 
the arms. 
An actuating unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims,
characterised
 in that the actuating pedal (30) 
is pivotally supported at a pedal assembly (44) mounted on 

the booster housing (3).  
 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 11,
characterised
 in that, in the mounted condition 
on the vehicle body wall (45), the actuating unit (1,2) is 

clamped in between the booster housing and the pedal assembly 
(44). 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 11,
characterised
 in that a fastening means (27,28) 
associated with the vehicle body wall (45) is provided at the 

periphery of the booster housing (3). 
An actuating unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims,
characterised
 in that the end of the bolt (14) 
remote from the master brake cylinder (2) is anchored at the 

pedal assembly (44). 
An actuating unit as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims,
characterised
 in that a transverse member (17) 
defines the inactive position of the valve piston (15) and is 

in axial abutment against a ring seal (16) sealing the 
booster housing (3) towards the outside.
