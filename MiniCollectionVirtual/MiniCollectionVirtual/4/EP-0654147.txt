<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a superconducting magnetic probe coil used to detect magnetic
resonances. More particularly, it relates to designs for a superconducting coil suitable for use as
a detector in a magnetic resonance imaging system for medical or other applications.For certain applications, it is desirable to have a magnetic loop sensor, tuned by the
addition of capacitance to resonate in the frequency range of 1 - 1000 MHz. In order to detect
very weak magnetic fields such a sensor must generate extremely low levels of noise and
consequently must have extremely low resistance and hence low loss. The lowest loss sensors
are made of superconductor materials. Until recently, all superconductor materials had to be
cooled below 30 K to operate as superconductors. This requirement added significantly to the
cost and complexity of systems which relied on these materials. The sensor design described
here is one appropriate to high temperature superconductors, i.e., superconductor materials
whose superconducting transition temperature (critical temperature or Tc) is higher than 30 K.
This latter class of materials, also known as cuprates, oxide superconductors and perovskites, is
better suited to use in thin film form than in bulk forms. This physico-chemical difference
necessitates new device and circuit designs to make these materials useful in superconducting
applications. The design can also be fabricated using conventional superconductors, like
niobium, which are available in thin film form.For certain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications, resonant frequencies of
approximately 5 MHz and sufficiently low resistance that the coil has a resonant quality factor
(Q) of not less than 104, and even as high as 106, are desired. The low resistances implied by
these high values of Q ensure that the coil's internally generated thermal noise will be less than
the noise generated by other noise sources within the imaging system, such as the tissue or
object being imaged or the preamplifier coupled to the coil. To achieve such high Q, it is
necessary that the equivalent series resistance of the LC resonator be less that approximately
100 µΩ to 1 mΩ. Such low resistance is achieved by the use of superconducting thin-film
metallization in both the coil and the capacitor. A key advantage of this approach is that the
sensor can be produced with a single superconductive film, and as a result it is more easily and
reproducibly manufactured.Several embodiments of this invention are disclosed herein. One
