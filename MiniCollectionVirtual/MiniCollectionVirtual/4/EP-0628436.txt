<ABSTRACT>
In a device for protecting against theft motor vehicle trailers which can be coupled to a towing vehicle by a drawbar coupling (1) which is attached to the end of a drawbar (11) by means of at least one through-screw connection (3a, 3b; 4a, 4b) and has a coupling mechanism which can be actuated by means of a pivotable hand lever (10), at least one end of the through-screw connection being capable of being received in a cover element (8, 19a, 19b) which secures the said through-screw connection against being removed from the drawbar (11) and can be secured to the coupling housing (2) in a nonremovable fashion by means of a lockable fastening (23, 27) and can be removed when the fastening is opened, and the coupling mechanism being capable of being at least partially blocked, a high degree of protection is provided both in the ready-to-travel state and in the parked state in that a blocking element (9, 24, 27, 15) which blocks the coupling mechanism outside its coupling jaw (25) engages on the at least one cover element (8, 19a, 19b) provided and can be secured, together with the cover element (8, 19a, 19b) on the coupling housing (2) in a nonremovable fashion by means of the fastening (23, 27).

Apparatus for preventing the theft of vehicle 
trailers, which are attachable to a towing vehicle by 

a towing ball coupling (1), which is mounted on the 
end of a towbar (11) by means of at least one 

through-screw connection (3a, 3b; 4a, 4b) and has a 
coupling mechanism actuatable by means of a pivotable 

manual lever (10), at least one end of the 
through-screw connection being able to be accommodated 

in a covering element (8, 19a, 19b), which prevents 
said connection from being removable from the towbar 

(11), said covering element being irremovably 
securable on the coupling housing (2) by means of a 

closable lock (23, 27) and being removable when the 
lock is opened, and the coupling mechanism being at 

least partially lockable, characterised in that a 
locking element (9, 24, 27, 15), which locks the 

coupling mechanism externally of its coupling mouth 
(25), is mounted on at least one of the covering 

elements (8, 19a, 19b) provided and is irremovably 
securable on the coupling housing (2), together with 

the covering element (8, 19a, 19b), by means of the 
lock (27).  

 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the covering element (8, 19a, 19b) is 

configured as a block-shaped lock body (8), which is 
provided with a recess (12, 12a) accommodating the 

associated end of the through-screw connection, a lock 
(23) being inserted into said lock body and being 

engageable in and disengageable from a lock 
counter-holder (7, 7a) mounted on the associated end 

of the through-screw connection, and said lock body 
being provided with at least one locking element (9, 

24, 27). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the lock counter-holder (7, 7a) is provided in 

the region of the nut end of the associated 
through-screw (3a, 3b). 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the lock counter-holder 

(7) has an undercut portion (7a), which is shaped to 
fit on the associated through-screw (3a, 3b) or 

preferably on a nut (26) of a counter-nut arrangement 
which can be screwed onto the through-screw (3a, 3b).  

 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the locking element is 

configured as locking pin (9), which protrudes from 
the lock body (8) and engages in a recess in the 

coupling housing (2), preferably in the form of a 
slide slot (5) associated with a bolt (6), which is 

displaceable by means of the manual lever (10), and/or 
as clamp (27), which is engageable with the manual 

lever (10), and/or as projection member (24), which 
engages in the coupling mechanism from below. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised 
in that at least one cover cap (19a, 19b) is provided 

as the covering element, said cap overlapping an 
associated end of the through-screw connection (3b) 

and being retainable in position by means of a 
bridging member, which bridges the two lateral walls 

of the coupling housing (2) and is lockable on the 
coupling housing (2) by means of the lock (27), said 

bridging member containing the locking element (15). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised 
in that two oppositely situated cover caps (19a, 19b)  

 
are provided, which are interconnectable by means of 

the bridging member. 
Apparatus according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that the bridging member is 

configured as the locking element in the form of a 
locking pin (15), which extends through the coupling 

housing (2), preferably in the region of a slide slot 
(5), said pin being provided at one end with a fixed 

stop member (16) and having at the other end a lock 
counter-holder (18) with an undercut portion (18a), 

the lock counter-holder (18) being engageable with a 
lock body (20), which contains the lock (27) and is 

lockable with the lock counter-holder (18) by means of 
said lock. 
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised 
in that the locking pin (15) is configured as the 

screw, onto which a counter-nut arrangement is 
screwable, one of the nuts being provided with an 

undercut portion.  
 
Apparatus according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that the bridging member has halves, 

which are lockable relative to one another by means of 
a lock (27) and engage above or below the coupling 

housing (2), at least one of the halves containing a 
cover cap (19a, 19b) and at least one of the halves 

containing a locking element.
