<ABSTRACT>
A device for filtering sensitive biological micro-entities, 
according to a special application animal embryos flushed from 

a donor animal uterus, the micro-entities appearing suspended 
in a flushing solution fron this flushing solution. The device 

(10) comprises a housing which includes an inlet chamber (22) 
and an outlet chamber (24), separated by a sheet of filter 

material (18) which allows the passage of the flushing 
solution but retains the biological micro-entities (72), an 

inlet tube (32) extending out of the outlet chamber. For 
keeping the micro-entities suspended in the solution until 

microscopic selection, the device (10) is designed for an 
operating position wherein the filter material (18) is 

vertically oriented, and in the outlet chamber (24) there is 
an overflow threshold (50, 52) between this chamber and the 

outlet tube (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for collecting 
sensitive biological micro-entities as may generally be used 
in animal reproduction, a particular application being 
collecting and transporting the embryos or ova of mammals. For centuries selective breeding techniques have been 
employed to generate animal offspring having preferred 
qualities such as size, productivity and temperament. Male 
animals having desirable genetic characteristics may naturally 
sire offspring by multiple females in a single season. In 
recent times artificial insemination techniques have made 
possible the generation of thousands of offspring from a 
single parent at locations throughout the world. To adequately 
exploit the genetic material of female animals without 
requiring the female fo give birth to all her offspring, a 
common practice is to inseminate the female by natural or 
artificial means and then extract the animal embryos at an age 
of three to five days. The extracted embryos are then 
typically frozen for shipment, processing, preservation or  
 
implantation at a later time. It is well known in the art of animal husbandry to retrieve 
and collect mammalian embryos or ova from donor animals by 
flushing the animal's uterus with a solution and collecting 
the embryo bearing fluids, then passing the fluids through a 
filtration device in which the embryos are collected. It is 
absolutely necessary that the embryos stay suspended in the 
solution and may not come into the situation of a dry ambient. 
Typical prior art devices require the collected embryos and 
solution to be transferred in the laboratory to a petri dish 
for examination beneath a microscope and removal and packaging 
of the embryos. Transfer of fluid from the collecting 
container to the petri dish is undesirable as embryos may be 
lost or damaged in the transfer. Some embryo collectors employ 
collection vessels which are transparent and which have a 
flat base to permit positioning on a microscope table, however 
these known devices are cumbersome and have filter openings 
formed in the vessel sidewall or base which are of limited 
extent and which may allow embryos to be trapped without 
liquid suspension. Furthermore, conventional adhesive 
attachment of filters across outlet openings leaves undesirable 
crevices in which embryos may become trapped. Frequently 
the collection of the animal embryos is performed on site in 
a barn. This subjects the embryos to the ambient temperature 
which may be lower than the temperature of the donor

A device for filtering sensitive biological micro-entities 
suspended in a flushing solution from this flushing 

solution, the device (10) comprising a housing which 
includes an inlet chamber (22) and an outlet chamber (24), 

separated by a sheet of filter material (18) which allows 
the passage of the flushing solution but retains the 

biological micro-entities (72), an inlet tube (32) 
extending into the input chamber and an outlet tube (50) 

extending out of the outlet chamber, characterized in that 
in the device (10) which is designed for an operating 

position wherein the filter material (18) is vertically 
oriented, in the outlet chamber (24) there is an overflow 

threshold (50, 52) between this chamber and the outlet tube 
(50). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
overflow threshold is constituted by a mouth opening (52) 

of the the outlet tube (50), said mouth opening being 
positioned at a vertical distance from the bottom level of 

the outlet chamber (24) in the operating position of the 
device (10). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
inlet chamber (22) and the outlet chamber (24) are confined 

by coaxial cylindrical structures (12, 14) coupled to each 
other so as to be mutually angularly adjustable
. 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that it consists of a dish (12) made of a transparent 

material and having a base plate (26) and a perpendicularly 
extending dish sidewall (28), and of a lid (14) also having 

a base plate (40) and a perpendicularly extending sidewall 
(42), wherein the lid is engageable with the dish to form 

a fluid tight compartment, the dish confining the inlet 
chamber (22) and the lid confining the outlet chamber (24). 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
filter material (18) extends over the open end face of the 

dish and/or or the lid. 
Device according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the
