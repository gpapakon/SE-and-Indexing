<ABSTRACT>
Self-stabilized resin latexes are provided which contain sulfonate salts produced by basic hydrolysis of chlorosulfonated C2-C8 alpha-olefin polymers having chlorine contents of 20-70 weight percent and sulfur contents of 1.5-10 weight percent. Further provided is a novel composition comprising a chlorosulfonated graft-modified ethylene/propylene copolymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous chlorosulfonated olefin copolymer
latexes which are useful in the preparation of adhesives and coating
compositions.Chlorosulfonated olefin polymers have been used as binder resins in
adhesive and coating compositions for many years because the presence of
chlorine along the saturated polymer backbone imparts chemical resistance
and outdoor weatherability to these products. Such compositions have
therefore been especially suited for use in moisture resistant adhesives and
marine and industrial coatings. Although the performance characteristics of
these products has been excellent, the use of such compositions has declined
over the years because they are solvent-based. Heightened concern
regarding the environmental impact and health hazards associated with
compositions of high volatile organic content (VOC) has led to a preference
in the industry for aqueous latex coating and adhesive compositions.Limited attempts have been made to develop aqueous
chlorosulfonated resin latex compositions, the objective being to maintain
chemical and moisture resistance while minimizing VOC, but such attempts
have met with only limited success. The high surfactant level necessary to
obtain stable latexes adversely affects adhesion and, in addition, moisture
barrier properties of coatings derived from the latexes have also proved to be
inadequate.GB-A-784,055 discloses dispersions of chlorosulfonated polyethylene.
It is taught that stable latexes can only be prepared if suitable emulsifying
and/or dispersing agents are present in the aqueous dispersion.The present invention provides stable aqueous chlorosulfonated latex
compositions which are self-stabilized as a result of their chemical structure.
Therefore, the use of conventional surfactants is not required and the
problems associated with the presence of large amounts of surfactants are
eliminated. More specifically this invention is directed to a stable
chlorosulfonated resin latex composition comprising an aqueous suspension
of a salt of a chlorosulfonated C2-C8 alpha-olefin polymer having a chlorine
content of 20-70 weight percent and a sulfur content of 1.5-10 weight percent
with the proviso that the latex is free of surfactants. These
compositions are particularly useful as binder resins in weatherable adhesive
and coating compositions.Such compositions form particularly stable
latexes which are useful for preparation of adhesives and coatings.The latex compositions of the present invention contain a partially or
completely
