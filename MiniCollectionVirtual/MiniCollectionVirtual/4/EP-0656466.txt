<ABSTRACT>
A combustion chamber (1) formed between a cylinder head (6) 
and the top of a piston (4) has a cavity (5) formed at the top 

of the piston (4). An injection nozzle (7) provided at the 

cylinder head (6) injects fuel toward the cavity (5) under 
high pressure. An upper and lower convex surfaces (9, 10) 

formed over an area between a narrow portion (8) and a bottom 
(11) of the cavity (5) are curved outward and are continuous 

in the circumferential direction. The convex surfaces (9, 10) 
reflect the fuel from the nozzle (7) toward the center of the 

cavity (5). A projection (13) formed at the bottom center of 
the cavity (5) has a truncated conical shape. The projection 

(13) causes the air turbulence in the cavity to diffuse the 
fuel reflected at the convex surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a direct injection 
diesel engine, and in particular to the structure of a 
combustion chamber formed in the diesel engine between a 
cylinder head and the top of a piston, into which fuel is 
injected by a injection nozzle. A conventional direct injection Diesel engine includes a 
single combustion chamber formed between the cylinder head and 
the top of the piston. An injection nozzle provided at the 
cylinder head injects fuel directly into the combustion 
chamber under high pressure. This type of combustion chamber 
includes a cavity formed in the top of the piston. During the 
compression stroke of the piston, air turbulence, produced in 
the cavity causes air to mix with the fuel. Accordingly, the 
shape of the cavity greatly affects the mixing of the air and 
fuel. One example of the related art that addresses the shape of 
such a cavity is the "Structure of Combustion Chamber of 
Direct Injection Diesel Engine" disclosed in Japanese 
Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. 62-97224. As shown 
in Fig. 13, a cavity 22 formed in the top of a piston 21 in  
 
this conventional structure has a narrow portion 23 which 
separates the cavity's inner surface into upper and lower 
portions. The lower portion is shaped with two distinct 
curvatures. A first concave surface 24 extends into the 
cavity 22 from the narrow portion 23 toward a second concave 
surface 25. The second concave surface 25, extends even 
further into cavity 22 in a way discontinuous from surface 24. 
In this conventional structure, part of the fuel that is 
injected from an injection nozzle 27 provided at a cylinder 
head 28 sticks on the concave surface 24 where it evaporates 
due to heat and moving air. This promotes the mixing of the 
air and fuel, thus improving the combustion or fuel 
combustibility. Since the inner surface in the cavity 22 below the narrow 
portion 23 forms the concave surfaces 24 and 25 in the 
conventional structure, the injection nozzle 27, should it 
operate under high injection pressure, may experience the 
following problem. Under high pressure conditions, the nozzle 
27 injects a fine mist of fuel with minute droplets into the 
cavity 22. Accordingly, a large number of fine mists of fuel 
is spread over the upper concave surface 24. This will 
degrades the combustion or fuel combustibility. Thus, with 
conventional high pressure type fuel injection, it is more 
difficult for the fuel to vaporize from the concave surface 
24. This will result in a poor air-fuel
