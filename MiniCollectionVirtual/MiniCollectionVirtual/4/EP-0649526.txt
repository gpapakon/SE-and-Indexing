<DESCRIPTION>
 CHEMICAL SWITCH AND METHOD FOR DETECTION OF CHEMICAL COMPONENTSBackground of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to a device and method for detection of specific chemical components in an environment containing many distinct chemical species. More particularly, the present invention relates to a chemical switch device comprising a film which irreversibly reacts upon exposure to specific chemical components in the environment under the conditions of measurement. The reactions can lead to large changes in the physical and chemical properties of the film which are measurable electrically, optically or by other methods. The term "conditions of measurement" is intended to mean any environmental conditions under which a reacted or unreacted state of the device can be determined. The chemical switches are "yes-no, " intrinsically binary devices that can be miniaturized, mass produced and directly incorporated into digital electronic circuits.Typically, electrical switches, such as fuses, are used to provide a break in an electrical circuit to prevent an electrical overload. Conventional irreversible switches are thermal fuses which fail by physical breakage of the electrical path due to resistive overheating. In the electrical embodiment of the present invention, an irreversible chemical switch can exhibit a large change in physical or chemical properties upon reaction of the switch material with a specific chemical component. The apparent physical or chemical change can manifest itself as a measurable increase or decrease of resistance due to an irreversible change in the switch material from a conductor or resistor to a resistor or conductor, respectively, upon reaction with a specific chemical component. The change is irreversible under the conditions of measurement, much like a conventional electrical fuse, except that the resistance of the irreversible chemical switch can either increase or decrease upon exposure to specific chemical components. Furthermore, other properties of the device, such as optical 

or thermal properties, can be used to monitor the extent of the irreversible reactions. The present invention also provides methods for detection of individual chemical components, e . g. , hazardous gases, in an environment using an irreversible chemical switch.The concept of an irreversible chemical switch, based upon irreversible chemical reactions, is believed to be heretofore unknown. In contradistinction to electrical fuses, which fail by thermal breakage of a conductive
