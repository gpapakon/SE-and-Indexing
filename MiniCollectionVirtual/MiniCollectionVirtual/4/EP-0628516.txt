<ABSTRACT>
For the removal of oxygen from water, hydrogen is fed to the water before passage through a catalyst bed. The water is fed through the bed upwards from below, where the bed is a floating bed with a counter flow. Also claimed is an appts. for the catalytic removal of oxygen from water with a tank (1) and a jet (2) at the base under a catalyst bed (3). The tank is fitted with feed connections (5,6) for the water carrying oxygen, and hydrogen and an outlet (7) for the cleaned water. The feeds (5,6) are below the first jet base, and the outlet (7) is above the catalyst bed (3).

Process for the catalytic removal of oxygen from water, wherein 
hydrogen is introduced into the water and this is then conducted through 

a catalyser bed, characterised thereby that the water is conducted from 
below to above through the catalyser bed, wherein the latter is operated 

in counterflow as a suspension bed. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised thereby that on 
introduction of the hydrogen into the water the pressure of the hydrogen 

is set to be higher than that of the water. 
Device for the catalytic removal of oxygen from water, with 

a container (1), 
a first nozzle base (2) arranged in the container, 
a catalyser bed (3) arranged in the container above the first nozzle 
base, 
a feed device (5, 6) for oxygen-charged water and hydrogen connected 
to the container, 
and with an outlet duct (7) for purified water connected to the 
container,
 
   wherein 
the feed device (5, 6) is connected to the container (1) below the 
first nozzle base and the outlet duct (7) is connected to the container 

(1) above the catalyser bed (3). 
Device according to claim 3, characterised thereby, that the 
container (1) has a second nozzle base (4) below the outlet duct (7) and 

above the catalyser bed (3). 
Device according to claim 3 or 4, characterised thereby that the feed 
device has an inlet duct (5), into which a hydrogen duct (6) opens, for 

oxygen-charged water.
