<ABSTRACT>

having from 2 to 8 hydroxyl groups and from 1X to 7X oxyalkyene units where X is the 

number of hydroxyl groups in the polyol and from 0.67X to 1.0X fatty acid acyl groups, 
at least 40% of the ester linkages being primary ester linkages. The fat substitute may be 

obtained by alkoxylation of a polyol with an epoxide in the presence of a cationic/ring-opening 
polymerization catalyst, followed by esterification with a fatty acid or fatty acid 

equivalent. Fat components comprising an edible triglyceride and the reduced calorie fat 
substitute and reduced calorie food products comprising said reduced calorie fat substitute

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to reduced calorie fat substitutes which are fatty
acid-esterified alkoxylated polyols wherein a high proportion of the ester linkages
present have a primary structure. These fat mimetics are obtainable by cationic
ring-opening polymerization of a C3 or higher 1,2-alkylene oxide in the presence of a
polyol followed by esterification of the alkoxylated polyol intermediate with a fatty acid
or fatty acid equivalent. The esterified alkoxylated polyols are useful as fully functional
replacements for edible lipids in the preparation of food compositions having
significantly decreased caloric content. The esterified alkoxylated polyol in a preferred
embodiment is an esterified propoxylated glycerin having at least 80% primary ester
linkages.A wide variety of substances have been proposed for use as fat substitutes in
food compositions. The chemical structures of such substances are selected such
that they are more resistant to breakdown by the metabolic processes of the human
digestive system which normally occur upon ingestion of conventional triglyceride
lipids. Because of their increased resistance to digestion and absorption, the number
of calories per gram available from these fat substitutes is considerably reduced as
compared to common vegetable oils, animal fats, and other lipids. Such substances
thus may be utilized in the preparation of reduced calorie food compositions useful in 
the control of body weight.U.S. Pat. No. 4,861,613 describes one class of particularly useful fat substitutes
wherein a polyol such as glycerin is alkoxylated with an epoxide such as propylene
oxide under basic conditions and then esterified with any of a number of fatty acids to
form an esterified alkoxylated polyol. These substances have the physical and
organoleptic properties of conventional triglyceride lipids, yet are significantly lower in
available calories owing to their pronounced resistance towards pancreatic lipase
enzymatic hydrolysis. The thermal and oxidative stability of the esterified alkoxylated
polyols renders them especially suitable for use in the preparation of reduced calorie
food compositions requiring exposure to high temperatures.Unfortunately, as a consequence of their hydrolytic stability, low digestibility,
and lipophilic character the esterified alkoxylated polyols described in U.S. Pat. No.
4,861,613 which are fully liquid at body temperature may tend to cause certain
undesirable gastrointestinal side effects when consumed at high levels in the diet.
