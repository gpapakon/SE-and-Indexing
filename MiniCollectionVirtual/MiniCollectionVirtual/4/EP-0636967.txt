<ABSTRACT>
A method for setting up the memories of an electronic 
controller operated in a fuzzy logic manner whereby 

membership functions (µ(x)) of logic variables are 
subjected to inference operations which are configured as a 

set of (IF-THEN) rules, each having at least one fore (IF) 
preposition and at least one consequent (THEN) implication, 

is arranged to store the data about a set of membership 
functions tied to the fore (IF) parts of the (IF-THEN) 

rules separately from the data associating each logic 
variable (X) with a corresponding one of the membership 

functions in said set.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an architecture of an 
electronic controller operated in a fuzzy logic manner, and 
to a method for setting up the memories associated with 
said controller. In particular, the invention relates to an architecture of 
an electronic controller, and a method for setting up the 
memories associated therewith, being operated in a fuzzy 
logic manner, whereby predetermined membership functions 
(µ(x)) of logic variables are subjected to inference 
operations configured as a set of rules (IF/THEN), each 
having at least one fore (IF) preposition and at least one 
consequent (THEN) implication, and being of a type which 
comprises an input section (2) having at least one input 
terminal for signals related to physical control variables, 
a central control unit (3) connected to said input section, 
and an output section (4) connected to said central unit. The field of this invention is related to developments of 
artificial intelligence, and specifically to electronic 
data processing instruments based on a logic of the so-called 
fuzzy type. This logic is asserting itself as a technique which can 
provide solutions to a comprehensive class of control 
problems, in relation to which traditional techniques have 
proved inadequate to yield solutions at an acceptable cost-to-performance 
ratio. A clearer understanding of the 
invention aspects calls for a brief discussion of the two 
principal methods of representing reality conventionally in 
use today. The first method provides a numerical/analytical 
description of reality, and is widely employed for all  
 
those applications where all the terms of a given problem 
and the rules which govern the interactions between said 
terms can be identified in an accurate manner. However, 
that method is difficult to apply to all those instances 
where the aspects of the problem to be solved are difficult 
to identify, such as to the field of artificial 
intelligence. In such situations, a 
quantitative/qualitative description of realityhas proved 
to be the most effective, The fuzzy logic provides a set of 
rules for dealing with problems which are wrapped in 
uncertainty and indefiniteness as is typical of most of 
human activities. In other words, the fuzzy logic provides a way of modelling 
the "indefinite" reasoning that is typical of human mind, a 
reasoning which plays, however, an essential role in human 
ability to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. 
In particular, the fuzzy logic operates on a linguistic 
description
