<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are methods and apparatus for a testing a field 
programmable logic gate array. In the method the non-volatile 

gates are set to a testable setting. The programmable logic 
array is then configured into (1) a pseudo random pattern 

generator, (2) a multiple input signature register, (3) a 
signature comparator, and (4) AND-plane and OR-plane logic 

array areas. A pseudo random set of test pattern vectors is 
applied to the programmable logic array from the pseudo random 

pattern generator. The output is captured in the multiple input 
signature register and compared in the comparator. Finally, 

individual non-volatile floating gate field effect transistors 
are selectively set to provide the desired set of sums of 

products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to field programmable logic arrays, and 
more particularly to field testing field programmable logic 
arrays. Logic arrays are characterized by a "sea of gates," 
that is, by an AND plane and an OR plane. The AND plane-OR 
plane "sea of gates" takes an input vector and produces a "sum 
of products" output of the input vector components. In a 
programmable logic array the ANDs in the AND plane and the ORs 
in the OR plane are settable, for example, by setting non-volatile 
floating gate field effect transistors, to thereby 
produce desired operations on selected bits of the input 
vectors. In a field programmable logic array the setting of the 
non-volatile floating gate field effect transistors may be 
accomplished without removing the programmable logic array from 
its environment. According to the invention the non-volatile gates are set to a 
testable setting. The programmable logic array is then 
configured into (1) a pseudo random pattern generator, (2) a 
multiple input signature register, (3) a signature comparator, 
and (4) AND-plane and OR-plane logic array areas. A pseudo 
random set of test pattern vectors is applied to the 
programmable logic array from the pseudo random pattern 
generator. The output is captured in the multiple input 
signature register and compared in the signature comparator. 
Finally, individual non-volatile floating gate field effect 
transistors are selectively set to provide the desired set of 
sums of products. The method of the invention can be analogized 
to setting the programmable logic array to a "blank sheet of 
paper" state and thereafter testing the now blank "sheet of 
paper" to verify that it is, in fact, actually a "blank sheet" 
with fully erased non-volatile gates.  Programmable logic arrays are capable of being programmed and 
subsequently reprogrammed to recover particular functions and 
operations. The programming and reprogramming is typically 
carried out by removing the device or even the complete package 
containing the device, and reprogramming the device. This has 
typically been done in an EPROM Programmer at a service 
facility, and is not done as a user capable task. Attempts to accomplish user programmability are described, for 
example in U.S. Patents 4,879,688, 4,937,864, 5,017,809, and 
5,105,388, and in European Patent 361525. U.S.Patent 4,879,688 to Turner and Rutledge for In-System 
Programmable Logic Device describes a programmable logic device 
that is field programmable and configuarble, but without 
testing
