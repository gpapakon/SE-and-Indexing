<ABSTRACT>
Optical CATV system for distributing signals, such as TV signals, 
belonging to different FDM channels. The signals are converted for each 

FDM channel by separate transmitting lasers (2) and only then combined and 
presented to the subscribers (6). Said separately converted optical signals are 

either transmitted to the subscriber side via separate optical fibres and there 
optically combined and presented to the subscribers, or are already combined 

at the transmitting side and transmitted in the combined form to the 
subscribers via common optical fibres.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a distribution system for simultaneously
distributing signals, such as TV signals, belonging to a set of
different FDM channels from an exchange, via an optical network, to
subscribers connected to said network, the signals being converted, in
E/O conversion means on the side of said exchange, from electrical
signals into optical signals. Such a system is generally known.
Signals - for example baseband TV signals - are frequency-multiplexed
in their electric form so that they can be transmitted via different
FDM channels to the subscriber side. At the subscriber side, the
signals can once more be demultiplexed. Hitherto it was common usage
for the signals of all the FDM channels to be converted, at the
transmitting side (exchange side), by one and the same E/O converter
(transmitting laser) and to transmit the optical signal consisting of
more FDM channels to the subscriber side. In practice this, however,
requires a certain number of transmitting lasers, as the output power
per transmitting laser is limited and is not sufficient for all the
connected subscribers. The electrical signal, which therefore
comprises all the FDM channels, is thus fed to a number of
transmitting lasers which are each intended for a group of
subscribers, and the subscribers belonging to that group provide all
the FDM channels. Normally, at the subscriber side, such a signal is
again distributed over the various subscribers and converted, per
subscriber, into an electrical signal. The electrical signal presented
to a subscriber thus comprises all FDM channels.One problem arising is that of intermodulation occurring,
particularly in the transmitting lasers - which, after all, convert
all the FDM channels - as a result of non-linearity in the conversion
characteristics of the transmitting lasers. Said intermodulation
manifests itself in particular owing to the electrical signals having
to be converted into optical signals, by one and the same laser, over
the whole frequency range of all the FDM channels.A related problem is that in some cases intermodulation also occurs,
as a result of distortion, in the optical fibres which transmit the 
converted optical signals to the subscriber side. The longer the
optical fibres, the more pronounced this phenomenon becomes.The present invention as claimed in Claim 1 is based on the following insight. In practice,
owing to the limited output power of the transmitting lasers and the
large number of subscribers which have to be served, a large number of
transmitting

Distribution system for simultaneously distributing signals
belonging to a set of different FDM channels (1...30) from an exchange

(I), via an optical network, to subscribers (6) connected to said
network, the signals being converted, in E/O conversion means on the

side of said exchange, from electrical signals into optical signals,
CHARACTERIZED BY E/O conversion devices (2) on the side of the

exchange (1), by which said set of FDM channels is separated and
separately converted per subset of FDM channels, each subset

having a correspondingly limited frequency range relative to the full
frequency range of said set of FDM channels, into optical signals by

modulating, in each E/O conversion device, an optical carrier by one
subset of FDM channels, and in that all those separately converted

signals are only then combined in the optical domain by means of an
optical coupler (3), and are distributed by means of one or more

optical splitters (3, 4), and supplied to 0/E conversion devices (5)
on the side of said subscribers (6) in which said distributed optical

signals are re-converted into replicas of said set of FDM channels and
supplied to each of said subscribers.
Distribution system according to Claim 1, 
CHARACTERIZED IN THAT
 the
optical signals, separately converted per subset of FDM channels in

said E/O conversion devices (2), are transmitted via separate optical
fibres (l
1...30
), each transmitting one subset of FDM channels, to the
side of the subscribers (6) and are only at that side combined by said

coupler (3) and are presented in the combined form (s
31...70
) to the
subscribers.
Distribution system according to Claim 1, 
CHARACTERIZED IN THAT
 the
optical signals, separately converted per subset of FDM channels in

said E/O conversion devices (2), are already combined, by said coupler
(3), on the side of the exchange (1) and then transmitted in combined

form, via one or more optical fibres (f
31...70
), common to the
different FDM channels to the side of the subscribers and are

presented to the subscribers.
