<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hollow copper corona 
electrode that is liquid cooled and a process for using 
the liquid cooled copper electrode in a corona 
apparatus or an ozone generator. In a corona discharge apparatus disclosed in US-A-4 774 062 an 
inner electrode and an outer electrode are mounted in a concentric 
relationship and are electrically isolated from each other. The inner and 
outer electrodes are substantially cylindrical and are spaced apart from 
each other to define a gap between the outer surface of the inner electrode 
and the inner surface of the outer electrode. The electrodes serve to 
produce ozone by passing an oxygen containing gas, preferably air, 
trough said gap and applying an alternating current high voltage to the 
inner and outer electrodes. It is well known that adhesion to the surfaces of 
materials is improved by the exposure to a corona 
discharge. Thus corona treatment has been used to 
treat the surfaces of thermoplastic materials to 
improve the adhesion of printing inks, paints, coatings 
and bodies of other materials. Many methods for the continuous corona discharge 
surface treatment of thermoplastic materials have been 
employed wherein the material continuum is passed 
through an air gap between stationary and roller 
electrodes. The stationary electrode is typically a 
bar or cluster of bars and the relatively large roller 
electrode is coated with a dielectric coatings. A 
high voltage, of the order of 20KV at 10kHz, is 
typically impressed across the electrodes. A corona  
 
arc discharge is developed in the gap and produces 
surface treatment of the thermoplastic material 
continuum which results in the promotion of excellent 
adhesion properties on the surface of the treated 
continuum. Recently, the stationary electrode has been 
coated with a dielectric layer rather than the roller 
electrode. The watts per inch of the corona discharge system 
during the continuous treatment of a thermoplastic 
material continuum results in the temperature of the 
surface of the electrode containing the dielectric 
coating to increase to a temperature as high as 150Â°C. 
Consequently, at this high temperature, the dielectric 
layer and the substrate will expand and if their 
coefficients of thermal expansion are not relatively 
close then the dielectric layer could crack, bend, 
distort or spall off. To overcome this problem, the 
substrate material of the electrode and the material of 
the dielectric layer are selected so that their 
coefficients of thermal expansion
