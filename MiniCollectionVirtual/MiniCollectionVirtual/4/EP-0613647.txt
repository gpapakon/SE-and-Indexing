<ABSTRACT>
In order to fix the perforated disc (2) to the bottom (1) of the vessel, the disc is fixed by die work, especially cold coining, in such a way that the metal of said bottom (1) is forced between the openings (4) of the disc (2). Simultaneously with the die operation, a series of reliefs (5) is formed on the surface of the perforated disc (2) and on the surface of the bottom (1) of the vessel.

<CLAIMS>
A method of fixing on the base (1) of a cooking
vessel a perforate plate or grid (2) of hard metal,

wherein the latter is fixed by stamping, more

particularly cold stamping, so as to cause the metal of
the said base (1) to penetrate into the openings (4) in

the said perforate plate or grid (2), characterised in
that after or simultaneously with the stamping

operation a series of raised portions (5) is formed on
the surface of the perforate plate or grid (2) and on

the surface of the base (1) of the vessel.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the die (3) used for fixing the perforate plate or

grid (2) has on its surface a series of raised portions
(6) complementary with those that it is required to

form on the base (1) of the vessel.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the raised portions (5) are formed on the inner

surface of the base (1) of the vessel.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
charfacterised in that the surface of the base (1) of

the vessel is covered by a layer (7) of non-stick
polymer.
A method according to claim 4, characterised in
that the distribution and shape of the raised portions

(5, 5a) are such that when the cutting edge of a knife
blade is moved over the non-stick coating (7) the said

cutting edge comes into contact only with the top of
the raised portions (5, 5a).
