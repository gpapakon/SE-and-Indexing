<ABSTRACT>
A disc shape data recording medium adapted for 
recording/reproducing information data in the MCAV system, in 

which sectors are allocated in an interleaving manner which 
is adjusted in accordance with a track location along the 

radius of the disc shape data recording medium so as that the 
data rate of the data recorded on the medium is unified over 

the data recording medium from its innermost track to the 
outermost track.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc shape data 
recording medium, and more particularly, to a formatting 
system for a disc shape data recording medium. Recently, a constant velocity control system so-called as 
a CAV system (Constant Angular Velocity system) has been used 
for disc medium such as optical discs and magnetic discs and 
data recording apparatus for use of such disc medium, due to 
an advantage of their increased access speeds for the data. 
However, a conventional CAV system has a problem that it is 
difficult to unify a data recording density along a line 
direction over the recording medium, in spite of that the 
track length differs between the inner record area and the 
outer record area. As uses of such a disc shape medium and a disc apparatus 
are expected to expand more and more, the disc medium is 
demanded to be increased the recording capacity in recent 
years. A way of increasing the recording density at the 
outer record area similar to a recording density at the inner 
record area has an advantage for improving the data recording 
capacity. Thus many proposals have been made for reducing 
the difference of the recording densities between the inner 
record area and the outer record area. These methods are 
generally called as a zone-bit recording system, a zone-split 
CAV system or an MCAV (Modified CAV) system.  Referring now to FIGURE 1, an example of conventional 
disc formats according to such systems will be described 
hereinafter. This example is a case where the data recording 
area is split into four zones from the innermost record track 
A to the outermost record track B along the disc radius. 
Thus each of the four zones includes one or more data 
recording tracks. Further each track is split into sectors 
along its longitudinal direction, which are treated as a 
minimum unit of recording/reproducing operation. The number of sectors per track for the four zones are 7, 
13, 19 and 25 from the inner area to the outer area of the 
disc, respectively. The data rate ratios of information on 
the four zones become equal to the sector ratios, at a 
constant rotation speed. Therefore, the data rate of 
information on the outermost disc area becomes about 3.6 
times of that on the innermost disc area. FIGURE 2 is a graph showing data rate changes of 
information in an exemplified conventional MCAV system disc 
format. The Y-coordinate represents an amount of read/write 
data [Sectors], while the X-coordinate represents a rotating 
angle [Rad.] of a disc. Because a large
