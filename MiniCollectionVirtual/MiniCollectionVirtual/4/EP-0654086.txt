<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides vaccines for preventing and controlling animal diseases, comprising a pseudorabies virus containing glycoprotein gp50 and having a mutation in its gp50 gene. The vaccines are suitable for use against Aujeszky's disease (pseudorabies), or against other animal diseases when the mutation is an insertion comprising a heterologous gene encoding an antigen corresponding to said animal disease. The pseudorabies virus may additionally have at least one mutation in one of its other genes, such as the gp63 gene or the gI gene. The vaccines are unable to spread from vaccinated to non-vaccinated animals.

<DESCRIPTION>
Pseudo-rabies
virus (PRV), also called Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) is
a highly neurotropic herpesvirus that causes Aujeszky's disease in
domestic and wild animals (for reviews see Mettenleiter, Comp. Immun.
Microbial. Infect. Dis. 14, 151-163 [1991]; Wittmann and Rziha, in [G.
Wittmann ed.] Herpesvirus Diseases of Cattle, Horses and Pigs, Kluwer,
Boston, 230-325 [1989]; Pensaert and Kluge, in [M.B. Pensaert ed.] Virus
infections of porcines, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam,
39-64 [1989]). Pigs are relatively resistant against PRV and therefore
are considered the natural host of the virus. The natural portal of entry
is the nasopharyngeal region. The virus is able to replicate in cells of
the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa, and after infection of peripheral nerves
it is transported to the central nervous system where it causes severe
encephalitis which is often fatal in young pigs. Older pigs usually
survive the infection, but may develop fever and pneumonia. Infection of
sensory ganglia generally results in the establishment of latency.Vaccination against Aujeszky's disease is carried out to limit the
economic damage caused by mortality and growth retardation in infected
animals. For this purpose, vaccines based on attenuated live virus and
on inactivated virus are available. Attenuated live virus vaccines are
generally preferred, since they are more easily produced and therefore
less expensive than inactivated vaccines. Moreover, attenuated virus can
be administered intranasally which provides better protection than
parenteral vaccination with either attenuated live virus or inactivated
virus.Early vaccines based upon attenuated live virus strains obtained
after serial passage in cell culture possessed several disadvantages.
Such vaccines were not homogenous and viral variants of unknown virulence
and immunogenicity were included in the mixtures. Moreover, such vaccines
suffered from a risk of reverting to virulence. More recently, the
increased knowledge, at molecular level, of the structure and replication
of viruses, and the availability of sophisticated molecular biological
techniques, have enabled scientists to design attenuated vaccines rather
than to rely upon chance. Viral genetics and DNA sequence analysis enable 
the identification of the regions in the viral genome where alterations
can contribute to the attenuation of viral pathogenicity. Recombinant DNA
technology allows such regions to be altered or deleted, leading to the
production of an attenuated virus with defined and

functional gp50 protein, for the preparation of a vaccine against animal diseases.
Use according to claim 1 for the preparation of a vaccine against Aujeszky's
disease.
Use according to claim 1 for the preparation of a vector vaccine against animal
diseases other than Aujeszky's disease said mutant comprising at least one gene

encoding an antigen or part of an antigen from another pathogen.
Vaccine for preventing and/or controlling an animal disease, comprising a
Pseudorabies virus containing glycoprotein gp50 and having a mutation in its gp50

gene as a result of which the virus is not able to express a functional gp50 protein.
Vaccine according to claim 4 for preventing and/or controlling Aujeszky's disease,
wherein the mutation is a deletion.
Vaccine according to claim 4 for preventing and/or controlling at least one animal
disease, wherein the mutation is an insertion comprising a heterologous gene

encoding an antigen corresponding to said animal disease.
Vaccine according to claim 4 for preventing and/or controlling at least one animal
disease, wherein in addition to a mutation in its gp50 gene the Pseudorabies virus

comprises a heterologous gene encoding an antigen corresponding to said animal
disease.
Vaccine according to any of claims 4-7, wherein the Pseudorabies virus
additionally has at least one mutation in one of its other genes, such as the gp63

gene or the gI gene.
