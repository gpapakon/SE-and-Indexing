<ABSTRACT>
A sheet steel with 
a structure wherein at least 

either intragranularly grown 
acicular ferrite or bainite with 

a packet size of 30-300 µm 
accounts for at least 95 % 

of the whole is produced by 
casting continuously a steel 

into a thin cast strip with a 
thickness of 0.5-5 mm, said 

steel containing 0.01-0.20 
% (by weight, the same will 

apply hereinbelow) of carbon, 
0.005-1.5 % of silicon, 

0.05-1,5 % of manganese, at 
most 0.03 % of sulfur, and 

if necessary 0.0005-0.0100 % 
of calcium or 0.005-0.050 % 

of rare earth element (REM), 
and the balance consisting of 

iron and inevitable impurities, 
cooling the cast strip at an 

average cooling rate of at least 
V (°C/sec) as defined by the 

following formula (1): 

log 
V ≧ 0.5-0.8 log Ceq (°C/sec) 
 
(wherein 


Ceq = C + 2.0 Mn 
 
), 

from the temperature range 
of the casting temperature 

to 900 °C to the temperature 
range of 650 °C to 400 °C, 

and winding the cooled strip 
at 650 °C or below.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an as-cast thin 
steel sheet having a casting thickness of 0.5 to 5 mm and 
particularly to a thin steel sheet having an excellent 
stretch-flange ability and a process for producing the 
same. At the present time, a thin steel sheet having a 
sheet thickness of 1.4 to 5 mm is produced as a hot-rolled 
steel sheet by using, as a starting material, a 
slab having a thickness exceeding 200 mm and subjecting 
the material to hot rolling. In the above current 
process, the basis of the technique for formation of an 
intended structure in the present saturation, that is, 
the regulation of the structure, is to increase the 
number of nucleation sites in transformation by causing 
recrystallization in the material in the step of hot-rolling 
the material to refine a coarse austenitic 
structure to increase the intergranular area or by 
rolling the material in a non-recrystallization region to 
introduce a deformation zone (a zone where the 
dislocation density is locally high) or by using other 
means, thereby enabling the structure of ferrite or the 
like, produced during cooling, to be refined. 
Incidentally, in the conventional process, the grain 
diameter of the austenite before transformation is not 
more than 20 µm, and also in the structure obtained by 
transformation, the grain diameter of the ferrite, for 
example, is not more than 20 µm. One of the hot-rolled steel sheets developed in the 
current process, which is a material required formability 
after punching (this material being used in, for example,  
 
strengthening components (members, wheels, etc.) of 
automobiles) is a high-strength hot-rolled steel sheet 
having an excellent stretch-flange ability 
(enlargeability). Such a steel sheet should have both a 
high strength as a strengthening member and workability. 
Up to now, high-strength steel sheets having a strength 
of up to 60 to 70 kgf/mm² have been developed. As 
disclosed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) Nos. 61-19733 and 1-162723, the steel 
sheets have a composite structure comprising a fine 
ferrite and a fine (in terms of packet size) low-temperature 
transformation phase (a fine pearlite, 
bainite or temper martensite). The term "packet" used 
herein is intended to mean a group of small units of a 
low-temperature transformation phase comprising a group 
of similar grain orientations which are identified by 
etching or the like. It is known that the local 
ductility, such as stretch-flange ability, is generally 
lowe
