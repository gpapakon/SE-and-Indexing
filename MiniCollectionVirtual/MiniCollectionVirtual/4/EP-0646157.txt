<ABSTRACT>
Use of an alkoxylated alkanolamide of general formula (I), wherein R is a hydrocarbon group having 7-35 carbon atoms, preferably 9-23 carbon atoms, A is an alkyleneoxy group having 2-4 carbon atoms, and n is 2-20, preferably 3-12, for producing a water-base liquid system with reduced flow resitance between the flowing, water-base liquid system and a solid surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of an 
alkoxylated alkanolamide in a water-base system for reducing 
the flow resistance between a solid surface and the 
water-base liquid system. It is well-known that the flow resistance of a liquid 
in a conduit is largely due to the turbulence that arises 
at the conduit wall. However, much of this turbulence can 
be prevented by adding to the liquid a sufficient amount 
of elongate particles. The size of these particles may 
vary within several orders of magnitude, from severed 
textile fibres, water-soluble chain molecules down to 
cylindrical surfactant micelles, i.e. within the range of 
10-7-10-2 m. The reduction of the pressure drop that can 
be achieved by such additions is considerable, and has, in 
commercial hot-water systems, been assessed at 75%, which 
involves corresponding savings in supplied pump energy or, 
alternatively, permits further extension of the distributive 
network with the same pump installations. In most cases, the addition of fibres is inconvenient, 
since various filters often are incorporated in 
circulating liquid systems, and the water-soluble chain 
polymers are torn by the high shear forces in the pumps 
and thereby lose their effect. Surfactants with the ability to form extremely long, 
cylindrical micelles have, in recent years, attracted a 
great interest as friction-reducing additives to systems 
with circulating water, especially those destined for heat 
or cold distribution. An important reason for this interest is that, 
althouah one desires to maintain a laminar flow in the 
conduits, one wishes at the same time to have turbulence 
in the heat exchangers to achieve therein a high heat 
transfer per unit area.  
 As may easily be understood, fibres or chain polymers 
are unable to provide this double function which, however, 
can be achieved with rod-shaped micelles, since the flow 
rate (the Reynold's number) usually is much higher in the 
heat exchangers than in the conduit. The rod-shaped micelles are distinguished by operating 
in a fairly disorderly fashion at low Reynold's numbers 
(below 104) and having no or only a very slight 
effect on the flow resistance. At higher Reynold's numbers (above 104), the micelles 
are paralleled and result in a friction reduction very 
close to that which is theoretically possible. At even higher Reynold's numbers (e.g. above 105), 
the shear forces in the liquid become so high that the 
micelles start to get torn and the friction-reducing 
effect rapidly decreases as the
