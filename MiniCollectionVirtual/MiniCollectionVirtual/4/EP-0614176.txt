<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disk
reproducing method and apparatus.Recently, an effort has been made to develop an
optical recording/reproducing method which meets
various demands such as a high density, a large
capacity, a high access speed, or a high
recording/reproducing speed, and a
recording/reproducing apparatus and a recording medium
(disk) used for this method.Information is recorded by, e.g., utilizing
three-dimensional patterns formed on a substrate or
reflectance difference caused due to a phase change
between crystal and amorphous phases, or by forming a
recording layer consisting of a magnetic film on a
substrate to record information by difference in
direction of magnetization, thereby forming a recording
mark.A laser beam is generally used to reproduce the
recording marks. The laser beam is formed to be a spot
as small as the diffraction limit defined by the
wavelength of the laser beam to read the phase shape of
the disk, the reflectance difference, rotation of the 
polarized light caused due to the magnetooptical effect
of the magnetic film or the like. Because of the noise
of the apparatus, a better S/N ratio can be obtained by
increasing the reproduction light amount. On the other
hand, in a rewritable optical disk, information is
recorded by heat using optical energy. Therefore, when
the information on the medium is to be reproduced, the
power must be controlled not to destroy the information
by the reproduction beam.In recent years, an information recording method
which changes the recording frequency in accordance
with the radial position on the disk to realize
higher-density recording has been proposed. However,
when the recording frequency is changed in accordance
with the radial position on the disk, the recording
frequency at the outer peripheral portion is increased
to broaden the reproduction frequency band at the outer
peripheral portion. For this reason, the S/N ratio at
the outer peripheral portion is degraded as compared to
that at the inner portion.In another information reproducing method, a
multilayered structure of magnetic layers is formed to
utilize magnetic super resolution due to heat of the
reproduction beam, thereby reading
high-density-recorded marks (MORIS' 91, 18-I-06).
However, in the above method, the medium temperature at
the reproduction position must be within a 
predetermined range. Even in one disk, the
temperature is increased by the reproduction beam in
a different way depending on the rotational speed or
linear velocity. Therefore,
