<ABSTRACT>
It consists of a profiled section (1) bent three times at right angles so as to form an angle bracket (11) with two sides (14, 15) of the same length and which is extended by two perpendicular flanges (12, 13), the two sides (14, 15) of the angle bracket (11) and the two flanges (12, 13) being pierced with aligned and evenly spaced holes (16, 17, 18, 19) along the entire length of the profiled section (1), the holes (16) pierced in the side (15) of the angle bracket (11) having a diameter which is substantially greater than that of the other holes (17, 18, 19) and designed so that the plane parallel to the side (14) of the angle bracket (11) flush with the edge of the flange (12) is slightly set back from, or at the very most, tangential to the circumference of the said holes (16).
