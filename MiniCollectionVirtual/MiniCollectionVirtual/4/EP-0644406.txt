<ABSTRACT>
To increase the weighing accuracy of a container weighing device, it is proposed that the pressure in the weighing container (1) is measured and the weighing signal from weighing cells (2) is accepted by the weighing electronics (3) for recording only after reaching a limiting pressure value, in particular atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, a description is given of a corresponding device for carrying out the method, having a pressure sensor (9) for registering the pressure in the weighing container (1).

Method of gravimetric metering of bulk material, which is
fed to a weighing container (1) out of a feed container

(7), is there weighed with determination of a weighing
signal for passing on to weighing electronics (3) and

metering control (3') and is then fed out of the weighing
container (1) with the pressure in the weighing container

(1) being measured,

characterized in that

the weighing signal is only transferred to the weighing
electronics (3) when a limit pressure value is attained,

especially atmospheric pressure.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
pressure in the weighing container (1) is measured

continuously.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
weighing container (1) is vented with a predetermined

increment of increase of pressure.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that, with pneumatic feed/discharge of the bulk material

with overpressure or underpressure, the pressure in the
conveyor line is additionally measured and is compared with

the pressure in the weighing container (1) to determine the
limit pressure value.
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that the
limit pressure value is determined from a pressure

difference from zero.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the pressure measured in the weighing container (1)

is used to control a metering member (4) and to optimize
the metering of the bulk material in the metering control

(3'). 
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that the bulk
material feed is switched off with a delay when there is an

excess pressure in the weighing container (1).
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that the bulk
material feed is switched off in advance when there is an

underpressure in the weighing container (1).
Apparatus for gravimetric metering of bulk material with a
weighing container (1) which is supported on at least one

weighing cell (2) connected to weighing electronics (3) to
determine a weighing signal and is connected by flexible

connections (6, 8) to a bulk material feed line (5) and a
discharge line (10), wherein a pressure sensor (9) is

provided on the weighing container (1),

characterized in that

the pressure sensor (9) detects a limit pressure value in
the weighing container (1) and the pressure sensor (9) is

connected to the weighing electronics (3) such that the
weighing signal of the weighing cell (2) is only

transferred to the weighing electronics (3) when the limit
pressure value is present.
Apparatus according to claim 9, characterized in that at
least one vent (11) comprising a filter (12) for relieving

the pressure is provided on the weighing container (1).
Apparatus according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in that
a further pressure sensor (19) is provided adjoining a

discharge device (10) to detect the pressure at the
discharge device (10).
