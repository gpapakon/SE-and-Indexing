<ABSTRACT>
A method for transporting particles such as 
polyolefin particles from a first container (10) to a second 

container (12). The particles are transported from the first 
container to the second container through a 

transportation pipe (24) by means of pressure difference 
between the first container and the second container. A 

valve (26) is provided in the transportation pipe near the 

second container, and the valve is closed and opened to 
transmit particles intermittently. Cleaning gas is fed 

into the transportation pipe at a position on the inlet 
side near the valve. The cleaning gas is gas consisting 

essentially of olefin monomer. The cleaning gas is fed 
into the transportation pipe while the valve of the 

transportation pipe is closed, and the particles remained 
in the transportation pipe are made back to the first 

container thereby to clean the transportation pipe. 
Therefore, inside of the transportation pipe is kept 

clean all the time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an 
apparatus for transporting particles, such as polyolefin 
particles, through a pipe. It is a very important subject to prevent a pipe from 
being clogged with particles while particles are 
transported from one container to another container 
through the pipe. For example, when polyolefin particles are produced 
by a gas phase polymerization method in a primary reactor 
and transported to a secondary reactor in a next process 
or a storage tank through a transportation pipe, it is 
conventionally employed as one of transporting means 
that, after the particles are drawn from the reactor or 
the storage tank into a purge tank, a pressure difference 
between the purge tank and the following reactor or the 
storage tank is provided sufficiently to transport the 
particles at high speed. In the conventional method, the clogging of the 
transportation pipe is prevented by transporting 
polyolefin particles at high speed. However, this means 
is still unsatisfactory, and there is a tendency to clog  
 
the transportation pipe. There is a case that lump polymer is formed in the 
polymerization reactor in the reaction process. The lump 
polymer may stick and remain in the transportation pipe, 
which causes the clogging of the transportation pipe. 
Also, if the particles which have still reactive abilities 
remains in the pipe, the polymerisation reaction proceeds 
and the clogging of the pipe is occurred. Once the 
transportation pipe is clogged, starting from the clogged 
part, the clogging gets worse and worse. In this 
condition, the transportation pipe may be removed to take 
out the clogging objects. In result, it may unwillingly 
lead to shutdown of the polymerization reactor or cut of 
the production. US-A-4087134 discloses a method of transporting 
particles from a first container to a second container 
through a transportation pipe, the method comprising the 
steps of: 
providing a valve in laid transportation pipe; making the pressure in said first container higher 
than the pressure in said second container; closing and opening said valve to connect or disconnect 
the transportation pipe with atmosphere. 
The pressure of the first container is 
atmospheric and particles are conveyed from the first 
container to the second container in successive batches in 
a suction flow which is interrupted by opening the valve 
provided in the transportation pipe. Opening the valve 
communicates the pipe to atmosphere and interrupts the 
flow of particles upstream
