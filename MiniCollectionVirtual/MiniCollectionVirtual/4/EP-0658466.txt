<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns railway trucks generally and 
apparatus for controlling truck hunting responses by 
resisting the relative rotational impetus of a truck with 
respect to a car body supported thereby. In conventional railway trucks such as three-piece 
trucks, hunting is an undesirable mode of truck movement 
along the railway track rails which is characterized by 
unstable cyclic yawing and lateral translation of the 
truck as it follows the truck wheelsets in the travel of 
their sinusoidal path of movement along the rails. As is 
well known, the truck wheelsets commonly will travel such 
a sinusoidal path in response to the contact forces 
developed by the interaction of the conical wheels with 
the cylindrical rail heads. A truck wheelset traveling 
its sinusoidal path moves transversely in cyclic fashion 
with respect to the rails. In doing so the wheelset both 
traverses laterally and yaws in a horizontal plane with 
respect to the rails. With the advent of the roller bearing for railway  
 
trucks, lateral wheelset freedom with respect to the truck 
side frames was essentially eliminated and the side frames 
thus were constrained to follow the wheelsets in their 
cyclic lateral traversing and yawing movements. In 
response to this constraint the truck may yaw cyclically 
about a vertical axis with respect to the car body 
supported thereon and/or translate laterally with respect 
to the rails. When such responses occur above a given critical rail 
car speed, the truck movements can degenerate into 
self-excited oscillation of the truck which is known as 
truck hunting. This can be destructive to the truck 
wheels and the rails as well as to other truck components, 
the car body and its lading due to the large magnitude 
impact loads sustained by all of these components. In the 
extreme, truck hunting can precipitate catastrophic 
failure of various affected components and result in 
derailment. The art has continually sought to reduce the incidence 
of truck hunting by various means including the use of 
fluid and friction damping to dissipate the energy input  
 
which drives the hunting responses. For example, it is 
known that a controlled resistance to the relative 
rotational movement between a truck and a car body 
supported thereby can be effective to restrain truck 
hunting. One commonplace means for providing such 
resistance to relative truck rotation, the constant 
contact side bearing, typically includes a sliding contact 
member that is maintained in biased frictional
