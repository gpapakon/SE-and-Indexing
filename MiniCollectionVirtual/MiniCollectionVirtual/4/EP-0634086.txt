<ABSTRACT>
A screw-type terminal arrangement (1) for compact programmable controllers essentially consists of a terminal part (2) and of a hinged cover (3). The terminal part has at least one latching lug (21), a labelling field (22) and two opposite journals (24) arranged in the upper area of its side surfaces (23). The hinged cover (3) consists of an elastic latching strip (31), which forms the bent part of the roof-like covering surface (32), and two elastic locking bars (33) with latching heels (34) at their ends. A mounting hole (35) is arranged in the locking bars (33). The hinged cover (3) is coupled in such a way to the terminal part (2) that the elastic locking bars (33) are outwardly bent over the journals (24) until the journals (24) engage the mounting holes (35).

Pluggable screw-terminal arrangement (1) for compact automation devices 
which house circuit boards (6) enclosed by a casing (4) and comprising 

electronic circuits, which presents a clamping part (2) with a plug contact part 
(25) and a group of screw terminals located side by side and serving for the 

electrical connection of external connecting lines, and of the electrical or 
electronic lines located on the circuit board, characterized in that a flap (3) is 

provided, that the clamping part (2) presents at least one snap-in cam (21), a 
labelling field (22), and two bearing pins (24) located in opposite directions in 

the upper area of its lateral surfaces (23), and that the flap (3) consists of a 
springable snap-in strip (31), which forms the bent part of a roof-shaped 

covering surface (32), and of two locking webs (33) located at its lateral 
surfaces and designed as springable elements, with snap-in lugs (34) being 

located at their ends serving for connection to the casing (4), while a bearing 
hole (35) is located one in each locking web (33), and while the flap (3) is 

hinged on the clamping part (2) in such a manner that the springable locking 
webs (33) are bent over the bearing pins (24) towards the outside in such a 

way that the bearing pins (24) engage into the bearing holes (35), and lock the 
snap-in strip with the snap-in cam when the flap is being closed, while the 

covering surface covers the openings (26) in the clamping part that give access 
to the screws. 
Arrangement consisting of a casing, a circuit board, and a screw-terminal 
arrangement as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the clamping part (2) 

is inserted in a positive fit into an opening (41) in the casing (4) when the flap 
(3) is opened, while the plug contact part (25) is plugged on the pin strip (5) of 

the circuit board (6), and thus establishes a contact.  
 
Arrangement as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the casing (4) presents 
catches (42) which are located in the rear corner areas of the opening (41), 

which meet the form of the snap-in lugs (34), and into which the snap-in lugs 
(34) engage under the action of a positive and non-positive fit of the snap-in 

strip (31) and of the snap-in cams (21) during the closure of the flap (3). 
Arrangement as claimed in any claim 1 through 3, characterized in that the flap 
(3) is designed in such a way that it serves as an extraction aid for the 

separation of the pluggable screw-terminal arrangement (1) and of the pin strip 
(5) in the opened condition. 
Arrangement as claimed in any claim 1 through 4, characterized in that the flap 
(3) presents a recess (36) which is located between its locking webs (33), and 

which corresponds to a head area of the clamping part (2) made available as a 
labelling field (22) when the flap (3) is closed. 
Arrangement as claimed in any claim 1 through 5, characterized in that the flap 
(3) presents a recess (36) which is located between its locking webs (33), and 

which corresponds to a head area of the clamping part (2) made available as a 
labelling field (22) when the flap (3) is closed. 
Arrangement as claimed in any claim 1 through 6, characterized in that the 
surface of flap (3), covering the openings (26), can also be used for clamp 

marking.
