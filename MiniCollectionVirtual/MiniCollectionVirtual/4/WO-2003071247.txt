<DESCRIPTION>
 CHEMICALLY INERT FLOW CONTROL WITHNON-CONTAMINATING BODYI. Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to fluid controls and more particularly relates to a chemically inert fluid control module that may be connected in-line within a chemically corrosive fluid flow circuit that delivers fluids in either a liquid or gaseous state. The fluid control module of the present invention may be utilized to control the flow, pressure or volume of fluid flowing through the fluid flow circuit and is capable of automatically adjusting or "calibrating" the module to compensate for changes in atmospheric pressure or drift in the pressure sensors of the fluid control module.II. Background of the InventionCaustic fluids are frequently used during ultra pure processing of sensitive materials. The susceptibility to contamination of the sensitive materials during the manufacturing process is a significant problem faced by manufacturers. Various manufacturing systems have been designed to reduce the contamination of the sensitive materials by foreign particles and vapors generated during the manufacturing process. The processing of the sensitive materials often involves direct contact with caustic fluids. Hence, it is critical that the caustic fluids are delivered to the processing site in an uncontaminated state and without foreign particulate. Various components of the processing equipment are commonly designed to reduce the amount of particulate generated and to isolate the processing chemicals from contaminating influences.The processing equipment typically includes liquid transporting systems that carry the caustic chemicals from supply tanks through pumping and regulating stations and through the processing equipment itself. The liquid chemical transport systems, which includes pipes, tubing, monitoring devices, sensing devices, valves, fittings and related devices, are frequently made of plastics resistant to the deteriorating effects of the caustic chemicals. Metals, which are conventionally used in such monitoring devices, cannot reliably stand up to the corrosive environment for long periods of time. Hence, the monitoring and sensing devices must incorporate substitute materials or remain isolated from the caustic fluids.The processing equipment commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing has one or more monitoring, valving, and sensing devices. These devices are typically 

connected in a closed loop feedback relationship and are used in monitoring and controlling the equipment. These monitoring and
