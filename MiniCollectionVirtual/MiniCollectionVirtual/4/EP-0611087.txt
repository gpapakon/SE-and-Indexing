<ABSTRACT>
A plastic closure including a base wall having an inner 
surface, a peripheral skirt extending from the base wall and a 

liner on the inner surface of the base wall. The liner includes 
(a) an ethylene vinyl acetate composition, (b) a primary fatty 

acid amide and (c) a bis-fatty acid amide. Preferably the primary 
fatty acid amide comprises an oleamide or an erucamide, and the 

bis-fatty acid amide comprises ethylene-bis-stearamide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to molded plastic closures and
particularly to compression molded plastic closures having
compression molded liners therein.Plastic closures have been commonly made by injection
molding or compression molding. In plastic closures made by
compression molding as shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos.
3,210,805, 4,343,754 and 4,418,828,
it is also common to compression mold a sealing liner
in place in the closure after the closure has been formed. Such
sealing liners may comprise polyvinyl chloride plastic or
thermoplastic elastomeric compositions. Polyvinyl chloride has
a tendency to overheat during extrusion and further has inherent
problems because of the removal torque when the sealing liner
is used on a PET container. Thermoplastic polymeric compositions
are most expensive and are more difficult to produce in that the
compounding necessary results in inconsistent quality and
consistency. Furthermore, such compositions produce problems
of torque removal on glass containers. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,807,772
and 4,845,362 disclose a compression molded liner being made of
a blend of polyethylene or polypropylene and thermoplastic
elastomeric copolymer so that the liner is removable.As a result of the problems with both types of
compositions, it has been necessary for a user to maintain costly
inventories of closures with both types of sealing liners in
order to accommodate use with both plastic and glass containers. In order to produce a satisfactory sealing liner that
would be applicable to both plastic and glass containers, it
must be necessary to not only formulate the composition but also
consistently extrude and cut off charges of the composition for
compression molding in apparatus such as shown, for example, in
U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,955,605, 4,080,136 and 4,277,431. The closure
must also match other closure requirements including satisfactory
removal torques, carbonation retention, and carbonation retention
under load and satisfactory functioning on a container when
cycled through environmental changes of temperature and humidity.In U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,703 (corresponding to EP-A-0 421 620) there is disclosed a
compression molded plastic closure having a compression molded
sealing liner which fulfills the requirements of a carbonated
beverage closure and operates satisfactorily on both plastic and
glass containers.When a plastic beverage cap has been provided with an
ethylene vinyl acetate liner, it has been found that erratic
high removal torques have been provided, the erratic high

<CLAIMS>
A plastic closure comprising

a base wall having an inner surface,
a peripheral skirt extending from said base wall, and
a liner compression molded on said inner surface of
said base wall,
said liner comprising

(a) ethylene vinyl acetate composition,
(b) a primary fatty acid amide selected from the group
consisting of an oleamide and an erucamide,
(c) a bis-fatty acid amide,
the total amount of primary fatty acid amide and
bis-fatty acid amide being 0.5%-1.5% by weight based on

the weight of the ethylene vinyl acetate,
the ethylene vinyl acetate comprising 85%-94%
by weight of polyethylene and 6%-15% by weight of vinyl

acetate,
the ratio of primary fatty acid amide to bis-fatty
acid amide ranges between 25:75 and 75:25, by weight.
The closure set forth in claim 1 wherein said bis-fatty
acid amide is selected from the group consisting of ethylene-bis-oleamide

and ethylene-bis-stearamide.
