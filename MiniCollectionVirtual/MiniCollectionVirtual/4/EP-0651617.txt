<ABSTRACT>
A composition which provides for sustained energy and nutrition to support an anabolic physiological state in humans comprises a blend of simple sugars and more complex carbohydrates, partially hydrolyzed protein, and, at least, magnesium in the form of an amino acid chelate. Preferably the carbohydrate source is a blend of about 5-45 % crystalline fructose and 55-95 % glucose polymers by weight. Other ingredients, including lipids, bioavailable minerals in the form of amino acid chelates, anabolic nutrients, vitamins, antioxidants, and lipotropic agents may be added as desired to provide an optimal sustained energy and anabolic nutrition formulation. When administered, the carbohydrate blend, protein source, and amino acid chelates facilitate sustained energy and delivery of nutrients to appropriate sites within the body for efficient utilization in anabolic physiology.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to dietary
supplements, and more particularly to a sustained energy
and anabolic composition comprising glucose polymers,
crystalline fructose, partially hydrolyzed lactalbumin,
bioavailable minerals, and, optionally, lipid for use as
a nutritional supplement.It is well known that both negative energy balance
and muscle catabolism are consequences of physiological
stress that often accompanies protein calorie
malnutrition, strenuous physical exercise, physical
trauma, burn injury, surgical trauma, malnutrition,
maldigestion, malabsorption, hyperthyroidism,
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, anorexia, cachexia,
short bowel syndrome, old age, and sepsis. It is also
known that maintaining a positive metabolic energy
balance can help to alleviate such problems and also has
a sparing effect on muscle catabolism that occurs during
strenuous physical exertion causing fatigue.To properly combat the above symptoms and permit
muscle growth, it is essential that appropriate amounts
of nutrients be available to supplant those which are
utilized. For example, during periods of physiological
stress, the body may burn large amounts of energy and
may also be depleted of body fluids and minerals.
Proper food energy (available calories), hydration, and
mineral bioavailability are essential to enable the body
to maintain a proper balance in both intracellular and
extracellular fluids and to also maintain proper
enzymatic functioning, pH balance, osmotic pressure, and
the like. Therefore, to promote endurance and
facilitate muscle anabolism it is necessary, in addition
to water, to provide a sustained source of energy, and
also a source of minerals that can be directed to proper 
cellular and/or tissue sites in the course of the
anabolic process.Currently, many types of sustained energy and
anabolic formulas are marketed which are generally made
up of different carbohydrates, including corn syrup,
high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, fructose, and
maltodextrin; proteins, including casein and other
proteins from milk and soybean; and lipids, including
corn, soy, safflower, and canola oils and medium chain
triglycerides. Additionally, many of these prior art
formulas contain relatively insignificant quantities of
magnesium and are generally high in sodium chloride
content. Though these formulas are generally suitable
as nutritional supplements, they possess certain
inherent deficiencies which detract from their overall
utility.
