<CLAIMS>
A sewing thread, characterised in that at least 
the outer surface thereof is impregnated with at least 

one precursor material which can be activated after 
processing, and after activation the precursor material 

is converted to a product which increases the adhesion 
between the sewn material and a seam made with the said 

thread, and the activation excludes a foaming process. 
A sewing thread according to claim 1, 
characterised in that it has a core of tension-resistant 

material and/or the product is an adhesive. 
A sewing thread according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the precursor material is at 

least one physically and/or chemically activatable 
substance. 
A sewing thread according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the precursor material is 

selected from the group consisting of:
 
silicone resins; alkyl silicone resins, methyl silicone 

resins; aryl silicone resins; copolymers of vinyl 
chloride and vinyl acetate; polysaccharides,
 
polysaccharide products insoluble in cold water; esters 

of polysaccharides and inorganic acids, esters of 
polysaccharides and organic acids; polysaccharide 

ethers; starches, potato starches; esters of starches 
and inorganic acids, esters of starches and organic 

acids; starch ethers, nitrogen-containing starch 
ethers, cationic starch ethers, particularly salts  

 
thereof; acrylamides, N- and C-substituted acrylamides 

or acrylamide oligomers; and mixtures thereof. 
A sewing thread according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the thread contains additional 

adjuvants selected from the group consisting of:
 
conventional finishes for threads; natural and 

synthetic waxes; paraffins; cross-linking agents for 

growing polymer chains, particularly methylene bis 
acrylamide or N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl ethylene diamine; 

plasticisers, particularly dibutyl phthalate, glycerol; 
inorganic fillers, organic fillers; activators; radical 

starters, peroxides, metal organyls, particularly 
aluminium organyls; and suitable mixtures thereof. 
A sewing thread according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the increased adhesive friction 

on exposed surfaces of the thread not in contact with 
the sewn material decreases after a period of not more 

than a few days, more particularly not more than a few 
minutes. 
A sewing thread according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the precursor material is 

acrylamide and
 
the adjuvants are methylene bis acrylamide and 

N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl ethylene diamine and glycerol. 
A sewable flat fabric, comprising at least two 
parts for sewing together, characterised in that its  

 
seam is sewn with a thread according to at least one of 

claims 1 to 7. 
A flat fabric according to claim 8, characterised 
in that the seam is a chain-stitch seam. 
A flat fabric according to claim 8 or 9, 
characterised in that a sealing strip or the like is 

disposed between the parts in the region of the seam. 
A flat fabric according to claim 10, characterised 
in that the sealing strip is a textile made of the same 

material as the sewing thread. 
A method of producing at least splashproof seams, 
wherein 


a) a sewing thread, at least on its outer surface, is 
treated with a precursor material of a product, and 
b) the sewing thread is supplied to a sewing device 
and converted into a seam on a material for sewing, 
 
characterised in that
 
c) the seam is activated by treatment which excludes 

treatment by foaming, wherein the precursor material is 
converted into the desired product, and wherein the 

product increases the adhesion of the seam to the sewn 
material. 
A method according to claim 12, characterised in 
that a stickv and/or sealing product is formed.  

 
A method according to claim 12 or 13, 
characterised in that the surface is continuously or 

discontinuously coated with the precursor material by 
spraying or immersion. 
A method according to any of claims 12 to 14, 
characterised in that step a) takes place after step 

b). 
A method according to any of claims 12 to 15, 
characterised in that the precursor material is 

selected from the group consisting of:

ethers; starches, potato starches; esters of starches 

and inorganic acids, esters of starches and organic 
acids; starch ethers, nitrogen-containing starch 

ethers, cationic starch ethers, particularly salts 
thereof; acrylamides, N- and C-substituted acrylamides 

or acrylamide oligomers; inorganic expanded materials 
such as expanded pearlite, expanded mica or expanded 

graphite; and mixtures thereof.

characterised in that in step a) and/or c) additional 

adjuvants are used, selected from the group consisting 
of:
  
 

conventional finishes for threads; natural and 
synthetic waxes, paraffins; cross-linking agents for 

growing polymer chains, particularly methylene bis 
acrylamide or N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl ethylene diamine; 

plasticisers, particularly dibutyl phthalate, glycerol; 
inorganic fillers, organic fillers; activators; radical 

starters, peroxides, metal organyls, particularly 
aluminium organyls; and suitable mixtures thereof. 
A method according to any of claims 12 to 17, 
characterised in that step c) comprises chemical and/or 

physical activation, particularly thermo-activation, 
hot sealing, high-frequency activation, activation with 

light, particularly UV light, chemical polymerisation, 
chemical hardening, radical starting; or combinations
