<ABSTRACT>
A tube (20) is held clamped in the vertical position between a fixed abutment jaw (14) and an obliquely upwardly pivoted clamping jaw (22) of a holding device (10). The movable clamping jaw (22) is enclosed by a rubber strip ring (38), by means of which said jaw is supported on the tube with a high degree of adhesion. Very smooth tubes are also prevented from slipping through.

A holding device for handles and tubes (20) of apparatus, having a plate-shaped support 
(12) which is to be secured to a building wall, a bearing jaw (14) with at least one 

bearing surface positioned vertically in the operational position projecting from this 
support (12) and a spring-actuated clamping jaw (22) with a bearing bore for a bearing 

pin (24) which is at right angles to the plane of the plate-shaped support (12) and is 
secured thereto being pivotally mounted on this support (12), the clamping jaw (22) 

having a clamping surface (34) which faces the bearing jaw (14), faces away from the 
bearing pin (24) and in the operational position of the holding device (10) is at a distance 

above the level of the bearing pin (24) which is less than the height of the bearing surface 
(16) of the bearing jaw (14), and having a resiliently pre-tensioned rubber tape ring (38) 

which is wound around the clamping jaw (22) and is fixedly held thereon, this rubber 
tape ring (38) forming two at least approximately rectilinear or slightly curved, elongate 

portions between a first approximately semi-circular curve in the region of the clamping 
surface (34) and a second approximately semi-circular curve, characterised in that the 

bearing bore of the clamping jaw is formed in an integral bearing shell (44) around which 
the rubber tape ring (38) extends with its two semi-circular curves, and in that the central 

region of the clamping surface (34) of the clamping jaw (22) has a V-shaped or concave 
recess in an axial section passing through the bearing pin (24), this recess being covered 

by the tensioned rubber tape ring (38) with the formation of a cavity. 
A holding device in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the rubber tape ring 
(38) is narrower than the clamping jaw (22) and is only associated with the central region 

thereof leaving its end regions free. 
A holding device in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the rubber tape 
ring (38) is received in a displacement-free manner in a circumferential channel (36) of 

the clamping jaw (22) and in the region of the clamping surface (34) is arranged so as to 
project slightly beyond the adjacent surfaces of the clamping jaw (22). 
A holding device in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
between the clamping surface (34) and the bearing shell (44) there is an elongate recess  

 
(46) provided in the upper side of the clamping jaw (22), the base of this recess (46) 

being at a distance from the rubber tape ring (38). 
A holding device in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
at least part of the support (12) is in the form of a guide rail (30) in which a slide (28) is 

mounted so as to be displaceable away from or towards the bearing jaw (14), the bearing 
pin (24) for the clamping jaw (22) being able to be screwed through this slide (28) and its 

end pressing against the support (12) and securing the slide (28) to the support (12). 
A holding device in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that the spring (26) is in 
the form of a leg spring through which the bearing pin (24) passes, one leg of this leg 

spring being supported on a base projection (32) of the slide (28) and its other leg being 
supported on a bearing surface of the clamping jaw (22). 
A holding device in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that a 
one-piece, pre-tensioned rubber tape ring (39) is wound around the bearing jaw (14), 

engaging around the latter at the top and the bottom.
