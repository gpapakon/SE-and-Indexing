<ABSTRACT>
A connector is provided which can positively conduct 
a current between two electrodes upon coupling two connector 

housings and inhibit conduction between the electrodes upon 
incomplete coupling. The connector includes a stationary 

side connector housing 1 having stationary side electrodes 
4. The housing 1 is provided on an inner peripheral face 

of a cavity 3 with guide grooves 9 and on a front end face 
with engaging projections 10. The connector also includes 

an insertion side connector housing 2 comprising a body 
block 14 having insertion side electrodes 17, a stationary 

plate 16 secured to the body block 14 and having intermediate 
electrodes 23, a movable member 15 having movable 

electrodes 20 and ribs 21, and locking pipes 22 on an outer 
peripheral face. Upon a coupling position of a locking 

mechanism in which the locking pieces 22 are fitted to the 
engaging projections 10, the movable electrodes 20 move to 

a position between the insertion side electrodes 17 and 
the intermediate electrodes 23 so that the insertion side 

electrodes 17 are electrically coupled to the stationary 
side electrodes 4. Upon detachment, the insertion side 

electrodes 17 are electrically disconnected from the 
stationary side electrodes 4.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector which brings
connector housings into a coupling position to thereby
maintain electrical conduction between electrodes.For example, in electric automobiles which have been
developed recently, it is necessary to frequently charge
a battery. In such a case, connection and disconnection
between the battery and a charger are effected by way of
a connector. Such a connector couples a pair of connector
housings to press-contact two pairs of electrodes provided
in the connector housings, thereby bringing the electrodes
into a state of electrical conduction. In order to lock
both connector housings in a coupling position, some
connectors are provided with locking means between the
connector housings.In a conventional connector, pairs of electrodes
are brought into a conductive state while being coupled
(so-called incomplete coupling position) upon coupling
the connector housing. Similarly, the pairs of electrodes
are brought into a conductive state while being moved to
a detaching position upon detaching the connector housings.
Consequently, charging can be continued even in an incomplete
coupling position caused in the case of mislocking
or unlocking upon coupling the connector housings.Since the connector housings are inclined to be
released relatively easily in the incomplete coupling
position, the connector housings under conduction of the
electrodes may be disconnected on account of their own
weight or an external tensile force. At that time, an
arc may occur between the electrodes or a short-circuit
is generated between the electrodes and another conductive
parts. An object of the present invention is to provide a connector which
can inhibit the electrodes from conducting in an incomplete coupling
position in which the connector housings are relatively easily
disconnected.FR-A-795 132 discloses a connector
assembly comprising a stationary connector having stationary electrodes, an insertion connector having insertion electrodes, and rotatable locking means for coupling the connectors together.In order to achieve the above object, a connector housing of the
present invention comprises:
   a stationary connector housing having stationary electrodes 4 and
an insertion connector housing having insertion electrodes; and locking
means rotatable between a first position in which said stationary connector
housing is coupled to said insertion connector housing and a second
position in which said stationary connector housing is detachable from
said insertion connector housing,
