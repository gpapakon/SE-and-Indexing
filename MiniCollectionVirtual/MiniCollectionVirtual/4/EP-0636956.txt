<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an updating method for an additional automation system (2'), which is intended to be coupled to an initial automation system (2), the initial automation system (2) controlling a technical installation (1). Until now, the program processing by the initial automation system (2) was interrupted for this purpose, the updating carried out and then the program processing continued once again by both automation systems (2, 2'). In the case of the present invention, on the other hand, the updating is carried out without an updating shock. One possibility consists in waiting for a non-time-critical installation condition and then carrying out the updating. A further implementation of the invention consists in scattering the updating in small time slices in the program processing.

<CLAIMS>
Method of updating a supplemental automation system
(2') which is coupled to an automation system (2) which

consists of at least one starting automation system (2)
and controls a technical process or a technical system

(1) by means of an executed program, wherein the update
method can be carried out while maintaining control of

the technical process or the technical system (1),
wherein a non-time-critical state of the technical

process or the technical system (1) is awaited for
updating purposes and wherein updating takes place

completely during this non-time-critical state,

characterised in that data configurations of non-time-critical
states are specified to the starting automation

system (2) so non-time-critical states of the starting
automation system (2) can be recognised.
Update method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the necessary update time is specified to the

starting automation system (2) so the starting automation
system (2) can recognise whether the time duration of the

non-time-critical state exceeds the update time.
