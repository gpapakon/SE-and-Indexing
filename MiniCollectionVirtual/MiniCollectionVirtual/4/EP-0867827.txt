<ABSTRACT>
A method of creating registration signature data for
a computerized signature collation scheme. A plurality of

signature data sets are averaged in order to calculate a
candidate set of registration signature data. The candidate

set of registration signature data is collated with each
signature data set. When no unacceptable discrepancy is

found as a result of collation between the candidate set of
registration signature data and the signature data sets,

the candidate set of registration signature data is treated
as registration signature data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of creating
registration signature data in a signature collation system.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a method
of creating registration signature data in a system in which
attestation of a person is performed based on the dynamic
characteristics of a signature.A handwritten character recognition method by which
written characters are recognized has been utilized as an
input method for word processors or a signature collation
method for specifying a writer. Under a handwritten
character recognition method which has already been in
actual use as an input method, characters are input in the
block style under specified constraints on the style of
typeface, and the thus-input characters are converted into
coordinate information. The thus-converted coordinate
information is verified by comparison with coordinate
information relating to character data which have been
stored beforehand. As a result of collation, the characters
are recognized as matched. If characters are carefully
written in the block style at comparatively slow speed in
the manner as previously described, the characters can be 
sufficiently recognized through use of only coordinate
information because under such conditions each of the
strokes of the characters becomes clear by virtue of visual
feedback to the writer and hence the shape of the characters
becomes stable.In contrast, in a case where the character recognition
method is applied to an input method which does not pose any
restriction on the style of typeface at the time of input of
characters or to a signature collation method, there must be
recognized not only characters written in the block type but
also cursively written characters. When characters are
cursively written, writing motion becomes faster and does
not involve any substantial visual feedback to the writer.
In this case, the characters become less identifiable, and
separation of a resultantly acquired pattern into strokes
becomes difficult. This is because an expansion or
contraction of the pattern in the direction of the time axis
or in the direction of stroke, or the difference between the
input pattern and a pre-registered pattern, becomes greater.
For this reason, a matching rate is extremely low, rendering
identification of characters difficult.Another method is to enable recognition of characters
without involving the separation of characters into strokes
by application of time-series coordinate information and
writing pressure. This method employs a
