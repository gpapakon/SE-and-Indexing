<ABSTRACT>
A method is described of producing a mixture of 
silicone polyethers from a mixture of at least two alkenyl 

ether terminated organic oxyalkylene compounds having 
different molecular weights and an organosilicon compound 

having at least two hydride substituents. In an alternate 
embodiment, an organocyclosilazane is used and either alkyl 

or alkenyl ether terminated organic oxyalkylene compounds can 
be employed. The mixtures have utility in the conditioning 

of skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to organosiloxane 
ethers and to methods of making organosiloxane ethers. In 
particular, a unique mixture of organosiloxane ethers is 
provided and two methods of making these organosiloxane ether 
mixtures are disclosed. Organosiloxane ethers are known in the art. U.S. 
Patent No. 2,846,458 describes a process of preparing organosiloxane 
ethers in which an unsaturated ether is reacted with 
a siloxane containing the ≡SiH group. In this method, one 
unsaturated ether compound is reacted with one siloxane 
compound containing the ≡SiH group and one organosiloxane 
ether product is produced. It has been unexpectedly found that if such a 
reaction is conducted between at least two unsaturated 
ethers, with one siloxane compound containing at least two 
≡SiH groups, a mixture of three distinct organosiloxane 
ethers can be obtained. The unexpected feature is that the 
mixture of the three distinct organosiloxane ethers produced 
by the present invention contains a third organosiloxane 
ether which cannot be produced by reacting either of the 
unsaturated ethers individually with the siloxane containing 
the ≡SiH groups. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the 
same result has been achieved by reacting at least two ethers 
with an organocyclosilazane. The invention provides a mixture of silicone 
polyethers prepared by a method in which at least two alkenyl 
ether terminated oxyalkylene compounds are reacted with a 
silicone hydride, to produce a mixture containing at least 
three silicone polyethers having different molecular weights.  The invention also provides a mixture of silicone 
polyethers prepared by an alternate route in which at least 
two alkyl or alkenyl ether terminated oxyalkylene compounds 
are reacted with an organocyclosilazane, to produce a mixture 
containing at least three silicone polyethers having 
different molecular weights. The mixtures of silicone polyethers produced by 
either method have been found to possess utility as a 
conditioning agent for personal care compositions for 
application to human skin. The uniqueness of the present invention can best be 
described by considering a scenario as prior art in which a 
silicone hydride such as HMe₂SiOSiMe₂H is reacted with an 
alkenyl ether terminated organic oxyalkylene compound such as 
H₂C=CH-CH₂-O-(CH₂-CH₂O)₁₂-H. If the silicone hydride is 
considered unit "B" and the oxyalkylene compound as unit "A", 
then the reaction will produce copolymers containing the 
units "ABA" with 20-28 total of
