<DESCRIPTION>
An important aspect of the manufacture, regulatory review and 
approval of all dosage forms concerns their stability over extended 
periods of time. The stability data obtained with regard to a particular 
dosage form directly affects its shelf-life. The stability 
of a pharmaceutical dosage form is related to maintaining its 
physical, chemical, microbiological, therapeutic, and toxicological 
properties when stored, i.e., in a particular container and 
environment. Stability study requirements are covered, e.g., in 
the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), the U.S.P., as well as in 
the regulatory requirements of the country where approval to market 
a dosage form is being sought. In the United States, a request to 
test, and eventually market, a drug or a drug formulation may be 
made via a New Drug Application (NDA), an Abbreviated New Drug 
Application (ANDA) or an Investigational New Drug Applications 
(IND). The agents used in sustained release dosage formulations often 
present special problems with regard to their physical stability 
during storage. For example, waxes which have been used in such 
formulations are known to undergo physical alterations on prolonged 
standing, thus precautions are taken to stabilize them at the time 
of manufacture or to prevent the change from occurring. Fats and  
 
waxy materials when used in purified states are known to crystallize 
in unstable forms, causing unpredictable variations in 
availability rates during stability testing at the time of 
manufacture and during later storage. It is known that certain strategies can be undertaken to 
obtain stabilized controlled release formulations in many cases, 
such as insuring that the individual agents are in a stable form 
before they are incorporated into the product, and that processing 
does not change this condition, retarding the instability by 
including additional additives, and inducing the individual agents 
of the dosage form to reach a stable state before the product is 
finally completed. It is also recognized that the moisture content of the product 
can also influence the stability of the product. Changes in the 
hydration level of a polymeric film, such as the ethyl celluloses, 
can alter the rate of water permeation and drug availability. 
Also, binders such as acacia are known to become less soluble when 
exposed to moisture and heat. However, moisture content of a 
product can be controlled fairly successfully by controls in the 
processing method and proper packaging of the product.
