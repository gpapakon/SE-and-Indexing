<ABSTRACT>
The method serves for separating off solids from a suspension and is generally carried out as a flotation method. The suspension (S) to be clarified is fed tangentially from the outside at the periphery of an essentially cylindrical clarifying space (1). By means of hydraulic elements (2) which are applied already before this inflow into the clarifying space, interfering flow phenomena, such as turbulences, are eliminated as far as possible, so that an optimal flow pattern is present in the actual clarifying space (1). The flow is conducted towards the centre of the clarifying space in an essentially spiral path (4), the scum (6) absorbing the substances to be separated off forming on the surface. Various devices for carrying out the method are proposed.

substantially radially and able to be moved in circumferential direction of the
