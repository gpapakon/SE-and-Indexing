<ABSTRACT>
A workpiece is formed comprising a silicon substrate (12,14,16) 
covered by four successive layers of silicon dioxide, undoped polysilicon, undoped 

WSi₂ and a top layer of silicon dioxide on silicon nitride. The four layers are 
patterned to provide gate electrode structures (30,40) each comprising the four 

layers. The workpiece is covered with a masking layer (42) and the top layer (28a) 
of each structure is exposed through the masking layer. The top layers are then 

removed and ions of one conductivity type are implanted into the WSi₂ layers of one 
group of gate electrode structures while another group of structures is masked, and 

ions of the other conductivity type are implanted into the WSi₂ layers of the second 
group while the first group is masked. Thereafter, doped regions are formed in the 

substrate adjacent to the gate electrode structures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor devices, and particularly to a method
of fabricating electrodes of such devices comprising layers of doped tungsten disilicide.Various types of semiconductor devices, e.g., MOS devices, include electrodes
formed from doped layers of polysilicon. Some of the layers are doped with N type
impurities and others with P type impurities. The dopants greatly increase the
electrical conductivity of the polysilicon. One prior art practice is to form a
continuous layer of polysilicon and to implant ions of one type impurity into first
portions of the layer while second portions of the layer are masked. Thereafter, the
second portions are unmasked, and ions of the other type impurity are implanted into
the second portions while the first portions are masked.One problem with this process, particularly when used in the fabrication of gate
electrodes overlying a thin oxide layer (formed on a surface of a semiconductor
substrate), is that it is difficult to control the doping process for obtaining complete
doping of the polysilicon layers while preventing penetration of the implanted ions into
the underlying gate oxide layer.A solution to this problem is to provide a layer of tungsten disilicide (WSi2)
covering the polysilicon layer and to selectively implant the various ions into different
portions of the WSi2 layer. WSi2 is an effective barrier against implanted ions whereby,
using high energies and high ion concentrations, relatively large quantities of ions can
be implanted into the WSi2 layer in short periods of time (desirable for reducing
processing time), with no ions penetrating through the WSi2 and polysilicon layers into
the underlying gate oxide layer. After the ion implantation processes, the
semiconductor workpiece is annealed for diffusing the impurities in each portion of the
WSi2 layer into the underlying polysilicon layer to form the differently doped
polysilicon portions. Such annealing can be carefully controlled, whereby proper 
doping of the polysilicon portions occur with no significant penetration of the dopants
into the gate oxide layer.As above-explained, the ion implantation of the WSi2 layer is done selectively,
using various masking layers, whereby different portions of the continuous layer of
WSi2 are differently doped. Thereafter, the doping masking layers are removed and
a new masking layer is applied which is patterned to expose those portions of the WSi2
layer which have not been doped during the ion implantation process. The new mask
is then
