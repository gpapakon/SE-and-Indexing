<DESCRIPTION>
The erythro-3-amino-1,2-epoxy compounds according
to the present invention have been used as a starting
material for synthesizing medicinal intermediates.
For example, they are employed as a useful
intermediate in the synthesis of an HIV protease
inhibitor (see EP 432694).Known methods for producing erythro-3-amino-1,2-epoxy
compounds include the following ones:
(1) a method comprising reacting an (S)-α-aminopropanal
derivative, which has been synthesized
from an (S)-α-amino acid, with
dimethylsulfonylmethylide [see J. Org. Chem., 50, 4615
- 4625 (1985)];(2) a method comprising reducing an (S)-3-amino-1-chloro-2-butanone
derivative, which has been
synthesized from an (S)-α-amino acid, with a ketone
followed by cyclization (see EP 346847); and(3) a method wherein the reaction proceeds via
(S)-3-amino-2-substituted-1-butanol which has been 
synthesized from an (S)-α-amino acid (see EP 432694).In the above methods, however, it is generally
needed to construct a novel asymmetric carbon atom and
the reaction cannot usually proceed stereo-specifically.
Accordingly it is unavoidable that
unnecessary diastereomer(s) are thus formed. In fact,
the above methods each achieve only a poor
selectivity. To obtain a desired product with a high
optical purity, therefore, optical purification
procedures (for example, optical resolution or silica
gel chromatography) are effected, which results in a
low yield and a poor operating efficiency. Thus these
methods are hardly regarded as a practically usable
one.Under these circumstances, the present inventors
have conducted extensive studies and consequently
found out a process for improving the above-mentioned
disadvantages.Accordingly, in the first aspect, the present
invention relates to a process for producing an
optically active erythro-3-amino-1,2-epoxy compound
represented by the following general formula (3): 

wherein R1 represents a hydrocarbon residue having 3 to 12 carbon atoms optionally
having substituents which do not affect the present reaction ; and R2 represents an amino
optionally protected by optionally substituted lower alkanoyl groups having 1 to 8 carbon
atoms, optionally substituted lower alkoxy carbonyl groups having 1 to 8 carbon atoms or
optionally substituted aralkoxy carbonyl groups, provided that when the carbon atom at
the *3-position has an S configuration, then the carbon atom at the *2-position has an S
configuration, and when the carbon atom at the *3-position has an R configuration, then
the carbon atom at the *2-position has an R
