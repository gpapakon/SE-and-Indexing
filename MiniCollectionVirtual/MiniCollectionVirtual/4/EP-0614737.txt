<ABSTRACT>
A dome-shaped extrusion die for use in forming 
honeycomb monolith structures is disclosed. The die is 

formed by deforming an extrusion die having a flat cross 
section to obtain a dome-shaped cross section. 

Alternatively, the die may be fabricated from sinterable 
ceramic or metal powders in which case the holes and slots 

may be formed either in the green state, or in a chalk-hard 
state after partial densification.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of fabricating dome-shaped 
dies. Typically, dies for cellular extrusions are 
formed from solid steel blocks by drilling feed holes in the 
entrance portion of the die and cutting slots in the exit 
portion of the die such that the holes generally intersect the 
slots. Dies can also be made by stacking plates which have 
the appropriate feed holes and slots so that they generally 
intersect when stacked. Monolithic dies for extruding cellular structures are 
usually made using straight round feed holes which communicate 
from the inlet side of the die to the slots in the outlet face 
of the die. This is because straight round feed holes are 
often easier and least expensive to make. However, straight 
round holes can lead to problems since shoulders are formed 
where the holes intersect with the slots. In addition to the 
problem of high wear, this creates high back pressure during 
extrusion. There are other problems associated with the 
traditional method of forming dies. For example, for very 
thin-walled cellular extrusions which require thin slots, dies 
made by the above methods have proved both difficult and 
expensive due to the extra processing steps often required to 
produce useful dies. For example, it has been suggested to 
coat the slots in certain dies to achieve the desired wall 
thickness. To avoid the sometimes abrupt changes in cross-sectional  
 
area of the feed holes at their junctions with the discharge 
slots, it has been suggested in co-assigned U.S. Patent No. 
5,066,215 issued to Peters et al., to form feed holes having 
a gradual transition of flow cross-sectional area and shape 
commencing at the entrance portion or end of the feed hole and 
terminating at the exit portion or end of the feed holes, 
where longitudinal and lateral flow through discharge slots 
commences. In the reference die, the cross-sectional area at 
any location along the length of any feed hole is less than 
at any location upstream thereof. While the suggested die 
eliminates the high bending forces on the die and also 
substantially reduces abrasive wear, it is relatively 
expensive to manufacture since each hole and slot combination 
must be cut individually. There continues to be the need for easier and inexpensive 
methods for fabricating complex-shaped structures such as 
thin-walled cellular or honeycomb structures which will not 
deform or break under pressure. Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention 
to provide a die for making complex

A dome-shaped extrusion die having an inlet portion, 
an outlet portion, and a junction between the inlet 

portion and the outlet portion, the inlet portion having a 
plurality of feed holes longitudinally extending from a 

convex inlet face of said inlet portion, the outlet 
portion have a plurality of intersecting and laterally 

criss-crossing discharge slots extending from the junction 
to an opposite outlet face on the outlet portion, said die 

having a curved cross-section. 
The die to claim 1, wherein the slots are tapered, 
narrowing from the junction to the opposite outlet face of 

the outlet portion. 
A method of forming a dome-shaped extrusion die from 
powders, comprising the steps of: compounding sinterable 

powders to form a mixture; shaping the mixture to form a 
preform; machining the preform by forming a plurality of 

longitudinally spaced feed holes and having a plurality of 
intersecting and laterally criss-crossing discharge slots 

in the body such that the slots are in communication with 
the feed holes; reforming the preform to obtain a curved 

cross section; and sintering the preform to form the dome-shaped 
die. 
The method of claim 3, wherein the mixture is formed 
by: 

   premilling the powders with a dispersant and a 
solvent to coat the powders with the dispersant; 

   dissolving or dispersing a high molecular weight 
thermoplastic polymer in a wax component at a temperature 

above the melting temperature of the wax to form a molten 
wax/polymer binder; 

   adding the milled powders to the molten binder at a 
temperature sufficient to blend the powder and molten 

binder; and

slurry or paste. 
The method of claim 3, wherein the curved cross 
section is obtained by contacting a portion of the preform 

prior to sintering with a material comprising titania-doped 
alumina or another sinter-controlling material.

material comprises vapor species crystal growth enhancer, 

or an aluminum and carbon-containing gas. 
The method of claim 6, wherein the vapor-species
