<ABSTRACT>
A pectin composition is provided that is a dry, heat stable, pectinate 
which when suspended in distilled water, will swell to heat stable particles 

having a mean equivalent diameter greater than 100 micrometers. This 
composition is useful for example, in foods, cosmetics, superabsorbents, and 

skin adhesives.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pectin compositions, processes for
preparing the same, and the use of the said pectin compositions.Processes for preparation of pectins are well known, as are many uses
for these products. In general, typical pectin processes include the steps of:
(1) acid extraction from plant starting material at low pH,(2) purification of the liquid extract, and(3) isolation of the extracted pectin from the liquid.In the acid extraction step, plant material is typically treated with dilute
acids such as nitric-, sulfuric-, hydrochloric- or other inorganic or organic
acids to remove the pectin from the cellulose components of the material.
Commonly used plant starting materials are citrus peels from juice production
and apple pomace from apple juice and cider production. Other plant starting
materials can also be used, such as sugar beet, before or after sugar
extraction, sunflower heads after removal of the seed, and other vegetables or
waste products from plants. Extraction conditions are selected such that a
major part of the pectin molecules contained in the plant starting material is
transferred from the cell walls of said plant starting material to the extraction
medium.The quantity and quality of the extracted pectin depends on the raw
material source and the selection and control of the extraction conditions such
as pH, temperature and extraction time. After the acid extraction step, a mixture of solid plant material and liquid
that contains the pectin remains. This mixture is then subjected to a
purification step in which the solid plant material is removed by filtration,
centrifugation or other conventional separation steps known to those skilled in
the art.The extract can, optionally, be further purified by ion exchange and
concentrated by evaporation of part of the water. Alternatively, the purification
step can be carried out by reverse osmosis, concentrating and purifying the
extract in the same step.The pectin in the acid extract can be isolated by reacting with aluminum
salts after adjusting the pH. The aluminum pectin gel thus formed is treated
with alcohol/acid mixture to wash out the aluminum salt and transform the
pectin into pectic acid. The pectic acid can then be neutralized and dried by
washing with slightly alkaline alcohol.More commonly, the pectin is isolated by treating the pectin solution
with an appropriate alcohol to render the pectin insoluble in the ensuing blend
of alcohol and water. Any alcohol or other organic solvent miscible with water
can be used,
