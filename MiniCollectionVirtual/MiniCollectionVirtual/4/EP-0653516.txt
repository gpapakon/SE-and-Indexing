<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a ligno-cellulosic-material-based 
product and a 

manufacturing method thereof, in which 
method the product is formed from 

multiple plies of cellulosic fibers into 
a multi-ply product comprising a liner 

ply and at least one center ply 
interleaved between the liner plies. The 

invention is characterized by having 
said at least one center ply of the 

multi-ply product enriched with thick-walled 
summerwood fibers, and further 

having the liner ply of the multi-ply 
product advantageously enriched with 

thin-walled and/or band-shaped 
springwood fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method in accordance
with the preamble of claim 1 and a
lignocellulosic-material based product according to the preamble of Claim 7.Multi-ply products belong to the well-known prior art. For
instance, EP-A-0484101 discloses a paper towel having two
outer layers of chemical fiber blend of chemical softwood
and hardwood fiber and a center layer of an anfractuous
high bulk softwood fiber blend of anfractuous fiber and
long mechanical pulp fiber.Multi-ply products such as multi-ply paper, board or cardboard
comprise more than two plies. Typically, multi-ply
board comprises three different plies so that the top-liner
plies may have identical composition. Correspondingly, the
center web ply may typically be formed by a web comprising
one or more plies of identical composition which are
couched together. As known, a multi-ply board acts as a
hollow-core beam structure in which the maximum stiffness
is attained by a composition having its center ply from a
material of maximally high bulk and the outer plies of a
liner material of maximally high Young's modulus. Optimally
this concept can be utilized by forming the liner and center
plies from entirely different types of pulps. A board
having the maximum possible bulk is achieved by using
mechanical or chemimechanical pulp in the center ply
(conventional folding boxboard).However, mechanical pulps do not offer as high brightness
and strength as chemical pulps. Hence, foodstuff packaging
and graphic art principally uses board grades made from
groundwood-free pulp and having their center ply also made
from chemical pulp. Resultingly, the manufacture of
foodstuff packaging and graphic art boards have involved 
product lines requiring a high degree of conversion and
special skills.The manufacture of mechanical pulps uses softwood almost
exclusively. In the pulping process, particularly in the
grinding step, long softwood fibers are cut and shortened
so that the formation of the center ply made thereof takes 
place in a satisfactory manner. By contrast, long softwood
fibers undergoing the chemical pulping process are not
subjected to such severe cutting, whereby the formation
properties of the produced pulp are extremely unfavourable.
To achieve proper formation, the center ply of board made
from chemical pulp is formed from hardwood pulp although
its bulk (particularly that of deciduous wood pulp) is
generally inferior and thus adverse to the goal of achieving
an advantageous structure for the beam structure of the
board center
