<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to appliances for use
in orthopedic surgical procedures to anchor a suture to a
bone. After attachment to the bone, the suture may be used,
for example, to attach a ligament to the bone.Certain orthopedic surgery procedures require that a
ligament be reattached to bone. Such ligament reattachment
may occur, for example, in knee or elbow procedures. Various
types of anchors have been used in the past to anchor the
suture to bone. These anchors are generally made of
biocompatible stainless steel or similar non-corrosive
metal. Suture thread is attached to the anchor and the
anchor is inserted into the bone. Prior art anchors
generally lack a simple attachment of the suture thread
thereto and may require cement for sufficient attachment
strength.When a torn ligament must be reattached to bone, the torn
end must be anchored to the bone and placed in close
proximity to allow the ligament to grow into the bone mass
and reattach itself. Various prior art devices are unsuited
for use in areas having spacial constraints. The
manipulations required to set the anchor into bone also
reflect upon the ability of the anchor to operate in
locations having spacial constraints. If a bone anchor is
unsuitable for placement in the original location of ligament
attachment, a nearby location having suitable space must be
utilized. The closer the suture is anchored to the original 
point of attachment of the ligament, the better for body
mechanics. Design limitations of prior art devices have
limited the optimal placement of the suture anchor and have
lead to less efficient attachment of ligaments. US-A-4,632,100 discloses a bone screw for anchoring a
suture thread to bone material. The bone screw comprises an
anchor and a suture retaining disc which is press-fitted into an
opening of said anchor to fasten a suture knot to said anchor.This invention relates to a cannulated bone screw as
claimed in claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are
claimed in the dependent claims. FIG. 1 is a side elevation view of a self-tapping
cannulated bone screw constructed in accordance with the

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cannulated bone screw (11) useful for anchoring a suture
thread to bone which comprises:


a biocompatible one-piece body (13) having a proximal end
(15) and a distal end (17), said body including exterior screw

threads (19) for inserting and retaining said body into the
bone;
said body defining a passageway (23), the passageway including
a central portion (24) and a distal portion (25), the central

portion (24) being sized to receive a suture thread
therethrough, the distal position (25) being sized to receive a

suture knot (27),
said body (13) further defining means for cooperating with
an external drive tool for rotating said body and for thereby

driving said body into the bone,
characterized
 by:
the passage way (23) extending through the body (13), the
internal diameter of the central portion (24) being sized

smaller than the internal diameter of the distal portion (25).
The bone screw of claim 1 in which said means for cooperating
with an external drive tool comprises a proximal cavity

(31) configured to receive an external drive tool. 
The bone screw of claim 1 or 2 in which said body (13) is
cylindrical and has a central axis, and in which the

passageway (23) extends axially therethrough.
The bone screw of claim 2 in which the proximal
cavity (31) is sized larger than the central portion (24) of the

passageway (23) and has a hexagonal cross-section for cooperation
with an external hex driver.
