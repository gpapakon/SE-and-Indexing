<ABSTRACT>
To prevent flashover between the body (S) of a vehicle, or the like conductive element, and a user (D) thereof, a pole (P) is arranged for electric connection to the car body through an electric resistor (R) having a suitable resistance value preferably between about 2 Mohm and about 5 Mohm, and an electric connection is established, at least temporarily, between the user (D) and the pole (P). In this way, the current peak transferred between the user and the car body can be brought down to such a value as to cause no inconvenience to the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for 
preventing electrostatic flashover between an object 
subjected to collect electric charges, specifically the 
car body of a vehicle, and a user thereof. As is well known, vehicles are liable, e.g. as 
a result of the motion to which they are subjected in 
use, to build up electric charges of the electrostatic 
type. This phenomenon is specially manifest with motor 
cars, in particular on dry weather days and in winter, 
in the form of a flashover between the user and the 
vehicle as the former contacts a conductive portion of 
the latter. Also known is that the extent of this 
phenomenon is tied to the presence of insulative 
materials that readily allow a potential difference to 
establish between two parts, as may be the user and the 
car body. The increased use of plastics materials, whose 
electrically insulating properties are well recognized, 
in the manufacture of modern motor vehicle parts and 
accessories has enhanced the phenomenon which, from an 
occasional occurrence tied to weather factors as above 
outlined, has grown to be frequent and widespread. To mitigate the inconvenience caused to the 
user by such occurrence of high-potential, albeit low-current, 
flashovers, expedients have been studied, see 
EP-A-0391263, AT-B-352823, DE-A-3606975. WO-A-87/07997 
and US-A-4654746 are also indicated as relevant. These documents disclose specifically designed 
key devices which allow prevention of flashovers.  
 
However the devices of the prior art can not be adapted 
to normally existing keys. The technical problem addressed by this 
invention is to provide a device conceived to overcome 
all of the drawbacks with which the above prior art is 
beset. This problem is solved according to the 
invention by a device for preventing flashover between 
an object liable to have built up electric charges, in 
particular the body of a vehicle, and a user thereof, as 
claimed in the appended claims. The invention will now be described in greater 
detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which: 
Figure 1 is a diagram illustrating the method 
of this invention; Figure 2 is a top plan view of a device as 
incorporated to a key for setting a vehicle to operate; Figure 3 is a sectional view taken along line 
III-III through the device in Figure 2; Figure 4 is a part-sectional top plan view of 
a variation of the device of the preceeding figures; Figure 5 is a sectional view taken along line 
V-V in Figure 6 and showing the device of the preceeding 
figures;
