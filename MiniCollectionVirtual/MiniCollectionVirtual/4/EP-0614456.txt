<ABSTRACT>
1 alpha ,24(S)-Dihydroxy vitamin D2 which is useful as an active compound of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of disorders of calcium metabolism and for various skin disorders. The invention also includes preparation of symthetic 1 alpha ,24(S)-dihydroxy vitamin D2 starting from ergosterol which is converted in six steps to 24-hydroxyergosterol. 24-Hydroxyergosterol is irradiated and thermally converted to 24-hydroxy vitamin D2 which is converted in six steps to 1 alpha ,24(S)-dihydroxy vitamin D2. The syntheses also produce novel intermediates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biologically active
vitamin D2 compounds. More specifically, this invention
relates to the hormonally active, natural metabolite
1α,24(S)-dihydroxy vitamin D2 and to methods of preparing
this metabolite and the nonbiological epimer
1α,24(R)-dihydroxy vitamin D2. This invention also
relates to a pharmaceutical composition which includes a
pharmaceutically effective amount of 1α,24(S)-dihydroxy
vitamin D2, and to its utilization, inter alia in controlling abnormal
calcium metabolism by administering a pharmaceutically
effective amount of the compound.Vitamin D and its active metabolites are known to
be important in regulating calcium metabolism in animals
and humans. The naturally occurring form of vitamin D
in animals and humans is vitamin D3. It has been shown
that in animals, including humans, vitamin D3 is
activated by being hydroxylated in the C25 position in
the liver, followed by 1α-hydroxylation in the kidney to 
produce the hormone 1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3
["1α,25-(OH)2D3"]. See, U.S. Patent No. 3,880,894. The
major physiological pathway for catabolism of the
vitamin D3 metabolites, 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 and
1α,25-(OH)2D3, is initiated by C24-oxidation.
Holick, M.F., Kleiner-Bossallier, A., Schnoes, H.K.,
Kasten, P.M., Boyle, I.T., and DeLuca, H.F., J. Biol.
Chem., 248, 6691-6696 (1973).Vitamin D2 is the major, naturally occurring form of
vitamin D found in plants. Vitamin D2 differs
structurally from vitamin D3 in that vitamin D2 has a
methyl group at C24 and has a double bond between C22 and
C23.Shortly after their discovery, it seemed apparent
that vitamin D3 and vitamin D2 had similar, if not
equivalent, biological activity. It has also been
commonly believed that the metabolism (i.e., the
activation and catabolism) of vitamin D2 was the same as
for vitamin D3. See, Harrison's Principles of Internal
Medicine: Part Seven, "Disorders of Bone and Mineral
Metabolism: Chap. 35," in E. Braunwald,
K.J. Isselbacher, R.G. Petersdorf, J.D. Wilson, J.B.
Martin and H.S. Fauci (eds.), Calcium, Phosphorus and
Bone Metabolism: Calcium Regulating Hormones, McGraw-Hill,
New York, pp. 1860-1865. In this regard, the
active form of vitamin D2 is believed to be
1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D2 ["1α,25-(OH)2D2"]. Further,
24-hydroxy derivatives of 25-hydroxy vitamin D2 and
1α,25-(OH)2D2, that is, 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D2 and
1α,24,25-trihydroxy vitamin D2, are known, suggesting
that catabolism of vitamin D2, like vitamin D3, proceeds
through the same C24 oxidation step. Jones, G.,
