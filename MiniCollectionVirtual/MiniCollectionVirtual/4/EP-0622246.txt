<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal 
transfer ink ribbon. Hitherto, there has widely been employed a 
thermal transfer printing method in which a thermal 
transfer ink ribbon having a heat-meltable ink layer 
formed on one side of a film foundation is heated with a 
thermal head from the back of the film foundation to 
selectively transfer the heat-meltable ink layer thereby 
forming printed images. To form printed images of satisfactory quality 
even on a paper sheet of poor surface smoothness 
(hereinafter referred to as "rough paper"), a thermal 
transfer ink ribbon has recently been employed of the type 
having an ink layer exhibiting bridging characteristics 
(i.e. an ink layer having a high melt viscosity which is 
capable of being transferred as bridging over depressed 
portions of the rough paper). This thermal transfer ink ribbon, however, has 
required a large amount of energy for printing and hence 
has posed the following problems. Due to great energy 
consumption, a battery of large capacity is required 
particularly where a printer is driven with a battery, 
resulting in a problem of a power source section increased 
in dimension. Further, since the pulse width of an 
electrical signal to be applied to a heating element of 
the thermal head for heating it cannot be narrowed, a 
problem arises that printing at an increased speed is 
infeasible. In view of the foregoing, an object of the 
present invention is to provide a thermal transfer ink 
ribbon requiring less printing energy. This and other objects of the present invention 
will become apparent from the description hereinafter.  
 According to the present invention, there is 
provided a thermal transfer ink ribbon comprising a 
foundation, and one or more coat layers provided on at 
least one side of the foundation and including at least 
one heat-meltable ink layer, the ink layer having a 
melting or softening point of from 60° to 120°C, the ink 
ribbon requiring a heat quantity of not more than about 
1,350 J/m2 to raise the temperature thereof from 25°C up 
to 120°C. The present invention is characterized in that 
the heat quantity required to raise the temperature of 
the thermal transfer ink ribbon from 25°C up to 120°C 
(hereinafter referred to as "heat capacity" for 
simplicity) is not more than about 1,350 J/m2, preferably 
not more than about 900 J/m2. The use of such an ink ribbon requires less 
printing energy and hence allows the use of a battery of 
decreased capacity for driving a printer. This results 
in a
