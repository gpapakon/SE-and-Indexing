<ABSTRACT>
A package (20, Figure 1; 100, Figure 13; 200, Figure 19) has two compartments 
(42,42'42''; 44,44',44'') defined by an intermediate wall portion (46,46',46''). One 

end of the package is permanently sealed and the other is releasably sealed by a 
releasable seal (52,52'). One side edge of the intermediate wall portion (46,46',46'') 

is releasably sealed to the package wall (50,50',50'') and is arranged so that the 
intermediate wall portion (46,46',46'') is detached as the releasable seal (52,52') is 

broken.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a flexible package and more particularly to a flexible 
package for holding at least two pourable materials isolated from each other within 
the package, which can readily be opened to enable the materials to be poured 
therefrom, e.g. for mixing together. Flexible containers formed of sheet materials have gained wide acceptance in 
commerce for holding chemicals or other air perishable materials therein. One 
common type of flexible package container is the so-called gussetted package. 
That package is arranged to be filled and sealed to hold the contents of the 
package under vacuum. Typically such packages are formed from a web of flexible 
stock material, e.g. polyethylene, polyester, polypropylene, metal foil, and 
combinations thereof in single or multiple plies, into a tubular body, having a front 
panel, a back panel, and gussetted sides. Each gussetted side is formed by a pair 
of gusset sections and a central fold edge interposed between a pair of outer fold 
edges. The lower end of many such packages is permanently sealed, e.g., heat 
sealed, along a line extending across the width of the package close to the bottom 
edge of the package. The top may also be sealed across the entire width of the 
package to maintain the vacuum seal, and be readily openable to provide access to 
the contents of the package. Flexible packaging of this type is known from US-A-4,488,647, 
4,518,087, 4,667,453, 4,705,174, and 4,953,708. It is one object of this invention to provide a flexible package for holding at least two 
free flowing particulate materials, e.g. granular or powdered pourable materials 
within separate compartments in the same package, which compartments keep 
those materials isolated until the package is opened. It is another object to provide 
a package as defined which can be opened by hand manipulation. It is another 
object to provide a package as defined and which includes a mouth portion which  
 
can be readily pulled apart to provide access to both materials so that they can be 
poured from the package together. In one aspect the invention provides a flexible package having a front wall portion, a 
rear wall portion and side wall portions, the package being closed by a seal at one 
end and releasably sealed by a seal at the other end and being divided into at least 
two compartments which extend from end to end characterised in that the 
compartments are defined by an intermediate wall portion which is releasably 
connected to either the front wall portion or

A flexible package (20, Figure 1; 100, Figure 13; 200, Figure 19), having a 
front wall portion (24, 24', 24''), a rear wall portion (26, 26', 26'') and side wall 

portions (28A, 28A', 28B,28B'; 202 and 204), the package being closed by a 
seal (40, 40' 40'') at one end and releasably sealed by a seal (52, 52') at the 

other end and being divided into at least two compartments (42,42',42''; 
44,44',44'') which extend from end to end characterised in that the 

compartments (42,42',42'' and 44,44',44'') are defined by an intermediate 
wall portion (46,46',46'') which is releasably connected to either the front wall 

portion (24,24',24'') or the rear wall portion (26,26',26'') such that when the 
releasable seal (50,50',50'') is opened the intermediate wall portion 

(46,46',46'') is detachable from the respective front wall portion or rear wall 
portion. 
A package according to Claim 1, wherein a length of one side edge of the 
intermediate wall portion (46,46',46'') is detachably connected to the 

respective front wall portion (24,24',24'') or the rear wall portion (26,26',26'') 
by a releasable seal (50,50',50''). 
A package according to Claim 2, wherein release of the releasable seal 
(52,52') at one end of the package (20,100,200) is arranged to release the 

releasable seal (50,50',50'') connecting the side edge of the intermediate 
wall portion (46,46',46'') from the front wall portion at the rear wall portion. 
A package according to any preceding Claim, wherein one side edge 
(48,48') of the intermediate wall portion (46,46'46'') is permanently sealed to 

the front wall portion (24,24',24'') or the rear wall portion (26,26',26''). 
A package according to any preceding Claim, wherein an end edge of the 
intermediate wall portion (46,46',46'') is releasably sealed by seals (56,56') to 

an end edge of the front wall portion (24,24',24'') or the rear wall portion 
(26,26',26''). 
A package according to any preceding Claim, wherein the seals are readily 
peelable by hand. 
A package according to Claim 6, wherein the releasable seal comprises a 
stripe (52,52',52'') of peelable flexible material is secured to the front wall 

portion and the rear wall portion and the intermediate wall portion 
(46,46',46'') by means of side seams (54,54'; 56,56'). 
A package according to any preceding Claim, wherein the width of the 
intermediate wall portion (46,46',46'') is less than that of the front wall portion 

(24,24',24'') or the rear wall portion (26,26',26''). 
A package according to any preceding Claim, wherein the front wall portion 
(24,24',24'') and the rear wall portion (26,26',26'') are formed from a single 

web and are joined by gussetted sides (28A,28A'; 28B,28B'). 
A package according to any of Claims 1 to 8, wherein the front wall portion 
(202, Figure 19) and the rear wall portion (204) are formed of separate webs 

and are joined together by permanent side heat seals. 
A method of making a packaging according to Claim 1 by forming a web into 
a tube, permanently sealing one end and releasably sealing the other end, 

the method including the steps of disposing an intermediate wall portion 
 

(46,46',46'') in the tube and connecting one side edge of the intermediate 
wall portion to the tube and releasably connecting the other side edge to the 

tube, whereby to form two compartments. 
A method according to Claim 11, wherein one end of the intermediate wall 
portion is connected to the releasably sealed end of the package so that 

when the releasably sealed end is opened one side edge of the intermediate 
wall portion is released from the tube.
