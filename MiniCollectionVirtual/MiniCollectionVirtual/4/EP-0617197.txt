<ABSTRACT>
When a shield tunneling machine is deviated from the 
scheduled line while being propelled, the deviation of shield 

tunneling machine from the scheduled line is detected and 
according to the obtained data on the deviation of shield 

tunneling machine from the scheduled line, the propelling 
direction of shield tunneling machine is controlled. 
A reflector 7 is mounted on a cutter head 1 provided with a 
cutter 5, while a target 10 and a screen 14 are mounted on a tail 

shield 2. Laser beam 9 is sent along the scheduled line. At the 
beginning of propelling shield tunneling machine A, the target 

and the screen is taken by s television camera 15. An image of 
the target and the screen is processed by an image processor 22, 

and a spot of beam of light projected on the target and a spot of 
beam of light projected on the screen are stored as the origin O 

and the origin o, respectively, in an image processing control 
unit 23. While the shield tunneling machine is propelled, the 

present image of the target and the screen is taken by the 
television camera, and processed by the image processor 22. 

Coordinates of the present spot 10a of beam of light projected on 
the target 10 and the present spot 14a of beam of light projected 

on the screen 14a are compared with coordinates of the origin on 
target O to another place and the origin of screen 0. When it is 

detected that the present spot 10a of beam of light projected on 
the target 10 the present spot 14a of beam of light
 projected on 
the screen 14a are displaced from the origin on target O and the 

origin of screen 0, jacks 3a, 3b are operated so that the present 
spot 10a of beam of light projected on the target 10 the present 

spot 14a of beam of light projected on the screen 14a are made to 
coincide with the origin on target O and the origin of screen 0.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of controlling 
the propelling direction of a shield tunneling machine used in 
the pipe-jacking process, and an apparatus therefor. The semi-shield process is applied for laying a conduit for 
sewerage or service water, wherein a shield tunneling machine is 
arranged, and the shield tunneling machine and Hume pipes 
following the shield tunneling machine are propelled by a 
pipe-jacking machine. In the semi-shield process, beelining laser 
beam is sent along a scheduled line on which a conduit is to be 
laid, the shield tunneling machine and a plurality of pipes are 
propelled along the laser beam by the pipe-jacking machine, while 
the ground is excavated by the shield tunneling machine. When the shield tunneling machine is propelled, a variety 
of resistances are applied on the shield tunneling machine. 
Therefore, it happens that the propelling direction of the 
shield tunneling machine is deviated from the scheduled line. In 
order to control the propelling direction of the shield tunneling 
machine, the shield tunneling machine is provided with a target 
on which laser beam is projected, and with a television camera by 
which an image of the target is taken, and with a pointer wherein 
a forward end of the pointer is attached to a cutter head of the 
shield tunneling machine and a rear end of the pointer is 
disposed by the surface of the target. Such a machine is known from EP-A-0,466,348. An image of laser spot projected on the target is taken by 
the television camera. The image of laser spot projected on the 
target is projected on a Braun tube and observed by an operator. 
When it is checked that the projecting direction of the shield  
 
tunneling machine is deviated from the scheduled line, a 
directional control means, that is jacks are controlled so that 
the cutter head is turned against the tail shield by which the 
direction of the shield tunneling machine is adjusted according 
to the movement of the pointer which corresponds to the 
orientation of the cutter head and the tail shield and an angle 
between the cutter head and the tail shield. In the shield tunneling machine, the target is mounted at a 
certain place in the shield tunneling machine. The shield 
tunneling machine is propelled by a pipe-jacking machine disposed 
in a start vertical shaft, while laser beam is sent from a laser 
beam source disposed in the start vertical shaft to the target. A 
spot of laser beam projected along the scheduled line on the 
target is made the origin
