<ABSTRACT>
A negative or positive photoresist composition 
which comprises an alkali soluble resin containing at 

least one resin selected from the group consisting of a 
partially alkyletherified polyvinylphenol and a 

partially alkyletherified hydrogenated polyvinylphenol, 
a photo-induced acid precursor containing at least a 

kind of sulfonic acid ester of N-hydroxyimide compounds 
and a crosslinking agent or dissolution inhibitor, and 

this photoresist composition is excellent in various 
properties such as heat resistance, film thickness 

retention, coating property, profile and the like, and 
further exhibits high sensitivity and high resolution 

when far ultraviolet rays including excimer lasers are 
used as the light source. It also hardly cause a scam 

during the developing process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resist
compositions particularly suitable for use in
lithography using far ultraviolet rays including
excimer laser.Recently, with an improvement in the
integration level of integrated circuits, formation of
lithographic pattern of submicron order is required.
Particularly, excimer laser lithography using excimer
laser as its light source is becoming more important, because
it makes it possible to produce 64 and 256 M DRAMs. As
a result of such a change of the light source used, the
following properties are demanded recently in addition
to the hitherto required properties such as heat
resistance, film thickness retention, profile, etc.:
(1) high sensitivity to the light source mentioned
above,(2) high resolution,In view of the above-mentioned state of art,
so called chemical amplification type resists utilizing
an acid catalyst and a chemical amplification effect has
been proposed. Using this type of resist, an acid is
generated from a photo-induced acid precursor upon
irradiation with light. And a reaction utilizing the
catalytic action of acid thus caused changes in the
solubilities in the developer of the exposed parts and 
unexposed parts, and amplified the difference between
the solubilities. As its result, a positive
photoresist or negative photoresist is obtained.As an alkali-soluble resin in such chemical
amplification type resists, polyvinylphenol has hitherto
been widely used. The solubility of the polyvinylphenol
in an alkaline developer, however, is too high, and due to
the high solubility, a photoresist exhibiting sufficient
sensitivity and sufficient resolution cannot be
obtained.It is an object of the present invention to
provide chemical amplification type negative
photoresist compositions exhibiting excellent sensitivity
and resolution while maintaining other favourable
properties of usual resists such as heat resistance, film
thickness retention, coatability, profile, etc.The present invention provides a chemical
amplification type negative photoresist composition
which comprises (A) an alkali soluble resin containing
at least one resin selected from the group consisting of
a partially alkyletherified polyvinylphenol (herein
after denoted to as A1) and a partially alkyletherified
hydrogenated polyvinylphenol (herein after denoted to as
A2);
(B) a photo-induced acid precursor containing at least a
kind of sulfonic acid esters of N-hydroxyimide compounds;
and
(C) a cross-linking agent. Examples of the sulfonic acid esters of N-hydroxyimide
compounds
