<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions useful for 
cleaning electrical contact surfaces. More 
particularly, the invention is directed to methods and 
compositions for maximizing electrical contact between 
contacting metal surfaces, particularly between the 
battery contacts in electrical devices such as portable 
lights, calculators, mechanized toys and games and the 
like. It is well known that the exposed surfaces of most 
metals tend to attract oxygen atoms, leading to the 
formation of metal oxides on the exposed surface. It 
also is known that the spontaneous growth of such an 
oxide film on an exposed metal surface can force its way 
between two contacting surfaces, particularly when 
contact pressure between the two metals is light, such 
as between disposable batteries and their spring mount 
electrical contacts. Because metal oxides are poor 
conductors (non-conductors or, at best, semiconductors), 
an interfering oxide film between 
electrical contact surfaces can reduce the area over 
which good electrical contact can be made, progressively 
degrading and eventually precluding electrical 
conduction. French Patent No. 1020679 describes a composition 
containing a rubber, linseed oil, glyceryl phthalate 
resin, graphite and terpene (a mixture of terpenes) for 
protecting battery terminals from acids. German Patent 
No. 3937297 describes a stick-type device for dispensing 
and applying an adhesive. It is an object of this invention to provide a 
composition and method for cleaning metal contact 
surfaces so as to effectively establish and maintain 
maximal electrical contact between electrically 
conducting surfaces, and to protect these surfaces from 
subsequent oxidation. It is another object of this  
 
invention to provide an inexpensive, reusable system for 
applying the composition of the invention to terminals 
of disposable batteries and for carrying out a preferred 
embodiment of the method of this invention. These and other objects and features of the 
invention will be apparent from the description, 
drawings, and claims which follow. Viewed from one aspect, the invention provides a 
composition for cleaning and preserving electrical 
contact between contact surfaces of a battery and a 
friction-fitted battery contact in a battery powered 
device, said composition consisting essentially of: 
a terpene solvent capable of displacing particles 
on an abraded metal contact surface; and in admixture therewith, a nonvolatile, 
spreadable, contact-adherent oxidation-occluding agent

A composition for cleaning and preserving 
electrical contact between contact surfaces of a battery 

and a friction-fitted battery contact in a battery 
powered device, said composition consisting essentially 

of: 

a terpene solvent capable of displacing particles

said abraded metal surface and selected from the group 

consisting of a wax, or a combination of a wax and an 
oil, 
wherein the amount of terpene solvent is in the 
range of 20% to 99% by weight of the total composition, 

and the amount of oxidation occluding agent is in the 
range of 1% to 80% by weight of the total composition. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
terpene solvent comprises a terpene or mixture of
 
terpenes. 
A composition as claimed in claim 2 wherein said 
terpene comprises limonene. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
3 wherein said occluding agent is a wax selected from 

the group consisting of: ester-type waxes, hydrocarbon 
waxes, and synthetic waxes.

3 wherein said occluding agent is selected from the 

group consisting of: carnauba wax, candelilla wax, 
beeswax, and paraffin waxes.  

 
A composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the oil 
is mineral oil. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
6 further comprising an amount of a coloring agent 

sufficient to provide a visible color to said abraded

A method for establishing and preserving electrical 
contact between a battery terminal and a battery contact 

in a battery-powered device, said method comprising the 
steps of: 


a) abrading the surface of at least one of said 
terminal and said contact, and 
b) applying to said abraded surface a composition 
as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9 whereby to clean 

said abraded surface with said terpene solvent and to 
deposit a film of said nonvolatile, adherent oxidation-occluding 

agent on said cleaned abraded surface. 
A method as claimed in claim 10 wherein steps (a) 
and (b) are performed simultaneously as a single step by 

manually rubbing said surface with an abrasive medium 
permeated with a mixture of a terpene solvent and an
