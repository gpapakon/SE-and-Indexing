<ABSTRACT>
An anti-friction bearing (2) consisting of an outer ring (8) mounted around an inner ring (10) is disclosed. One of the seals (14) that seal the bearing (2) incorporates an encoding element rotationally secured to the rotating ring (8), and comprises a core element with a radial extension extending along the side surface of the rotating ring (8) of the bearing (2). A hub (1) comprising such a bearing (2) is also disclosed. The thickness, in the axial direction of the bearing (2), of the radial extension of the core element of the seal (14) that includes the encoding element is the same as the axial offset caused between the stub-axle carrier (4) of the hub (1) and the inner ring (10) of the bearing (2) by the means for attaching the sensor element to the stub-axle carrier (4).

A wheel hub (1) mounted, by means of a rolling bearing (2) about a
steering knuckle (3) and bearing against a steering knuckle pin (4), the

bearing (2) being constituted by an external ring (8) mounted, by means of
rolling bodies (9), about an internal ring (10), one of the sealing joints (14)

which provide the sealing of the bearing (2) integrating a coding element
(17) interdependent in its rotation with the rotary ring (8), and co-operating

with a sensor element (20), said sensor element (20) being fixed on the
steering knuckle pin (4) by means of fixing means (21), 
characterised in
that
 the sealing joint (14) integrating the coding element (17) comprises an
armature (18) which has a radial extension (22) extending along the lateral

face of the rotary ring (8) of the bearing (2), and 
in that
 the thickness,
according to the axis of the bearing (2), of the radial extension (22) of the

armature (18) of the sealing joint (14) integrating the coding element (17) is
equal to the axial displacement introduced between the steering knuckle pin

(4) and the internal ring (10) of the rolling bearing (2) by the means (21) for
fixing the sensor element (20) on the steering knuckle pin (4).
Wheel hub (1) according to the preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 the
bearing (2) is mounted inside an internal bore (1a) of the hub (1),

comprising a circular groove (1c) in which a circular locking ring (11) is
mounted, bearing against the external lateral face (8) of the rolling

bearing (2).
Wheel hub (1) according to the preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 the
circular locking ring (11) extends outside the circular groove (1c) towards

the outside of the wheel, along the internal bore (1a) of the hub by an
annular part (11b) providing said ring (11) with an overall radial section in

the shape of an "L". 
Wheel hub (1) according to the preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 the
length, according to the axis, of the annular part (11b) is at least equal to the

thickness of the radial extension (22) of the armature (18).
Wheel hub (1) according to any one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that

the thickness, according to the axis, of the part (11a) of the locking ring
(11) located inside the circular groove (1c), is less than the thickness,

according to the axis, of said groove (1c).
Wheel hub (1) according to the preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 the
difference in thickness, according to the axis, between the groove (1c) and

the part (11a) of the locking ring (11) located inside said circular groove
(1c) is equal to the axial displacement introduced between the steering

knuckle pin (4) and the internal ring (10) of the rolling bearing (2) by the
means (21) for fixing the sensor element (20) on the steering knuckle

pin (4).
