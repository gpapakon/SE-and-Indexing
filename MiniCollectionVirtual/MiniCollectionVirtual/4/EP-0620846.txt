<ABSTRACT>
A process for the cultivation in continuous culture of a filamentous microorganism in a culture medium to which are supplied sources of carbon and other appropriate nutrients. The carbon or another nutrient source is supplied in an amount limiting to the growth of the culture and constitutes a limiting nutrient thereto. The development of an unwanted variant of the filamentous microorganism is restricted or delayed by supplying a first nutrient source to the culture as a limiting nutrient, and thus changing the nutrient supply to the culture in a manner such that a second nutrient source replaces the first nutrient source as the limiting nutrient.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the continuous or
fed batch cultivation of a filamentous microorganism which is
controlled to delay or prevent the development of an undesirable
variant in the the culture. In particular the invention relates
to a process for the production of a proteinaceous product or a
metabolite.During continuous cultivation of filamentous micro-organisms
there is a tendency, particularly after prolonged cultivation,
for highly branched colonial variants of the micro-organism to
appear. Sometimes these variants appear to a limited extent only
and do not significantly affect the overall growth of the
culture. In other instances however the variants occur to an
increasing extent and can eventually become the main
microorganism components of the cultures containing them. This
tendency has undesirable consequences for commercial
fermentations using filamentous microorganisms, particularly
fermentations for the production of proteinaceous compositions
where it is often desirable to produce filamentous microorganisms
having only limited hyphal branching.Since 1969 a process has been developed in which a strain of
Fusarium graminearum (Schwabe) is cultivated in a medium
containing wheat starch to produce a proteinaceous product which
can be formulated into a high protein food for human consumption.
The product of this process has good nutritional properties and
can be made into a convincing analogue of fibrous foods such as
meat and poultry. This process is described inter alia in
GB 1346061; GB 1346062; EP 123434 and by Trinci et al in
Chapter 2 of "Microbial Growth Dynamics", edited by R K Poole et
al and published by the Society of General Microbiology the
contents of wnich documents are incorporated herein by reference.
It is desirable that the cultivation conditions are controlled to
produce restricted branching of the filamentous product and to
limit the extent to which undesirable colonial variants of the
process micro-organism develop in the culture. We have now developed a means whereby a continuous
cultivation of a filamentous microorganism can be controlled to
delay or prevent the development of an undesirable variant in the
culture.According to the present invention we provide a process for
the cultivation in continuous culture of a filamentous
microorganism in a culture medium to which are supplied sources
of appropriate nutrients including carbon, are nutrient source
being supplied in an amount limiting to the growth of the culture
and constituting a limiting nutrient

<CLAIMS>
A process for the cultivation in continuous culture of a
filamentous microorganism in a culture medium to which are

supplied sources of carbon and other appropriate nutrients, the
carbon or another nutrient source being supplied in an amount

limiting to the growth of the culture and constituting a limiting
nutrient thereto wherein development of a variant of the

filamentous microorganism is restricted and/or delayed by
supplying a first nutrient source to the culture as a limiting

nutrient and then changing the nutrient supply to the culture in
a manner such that a second nutrient source replaces the first

nutrient source as the limiting nutrient.
A process for the production of a proteinaceous product by
cultivation in continuous culture of a filamentous microorganism

in a culture medium to which are supplied sources of carbon and
other appropriate nutrients the carbon or another nutrient source

being supplied in an amount limiting to the growth of the culture
and constituting a limiting nutrient thereto and separation of

the filamentous microorganism from the culture wherein
development of a variant of the filamentous microorganism is

restricted and/or delayed by supplying a first nutrient source to
the culture as a limiting nutrient and then changing the nutrient

supply to the culture in a manner such that a second nutrient
source replaces the first nutrient source as the limiting

nutrient.
A process for the production of a metabolite by cultivation
in continuous culture of a filamentous microorganism in a culture

medium to which are supplied sources of carbon and other
appropriate nutrients the carbon or another nutrient source being

supplied in an amount limiting to the growth of the culture and
constituting a limiting nutrient thereto and recovery of the

metabolite from the filamentous microorganism produced or from
the culture medium wherein development of a variant of the

filamentous microorganism is restricted and/or delayed by
supplying a first nutrient source to the culture as a limiting

nutrient and then changing the nutrient supply to the culture in
a manner such that a second nutrient source replaces the first

nutrient source as the limiting nutrient. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which the
filamentous microorganism is a strain of the genus 
Fusarium.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which three
or more different nutrient sources are used in turn as the

limiting nutrient.
A process according to Claim 5 in which the nutrient sources
are used as a limiting nutrient according to a regular cycle.
A process as claimed in Claim 6 in which the replacement of
nutrient sources as limiting nutrients is made at predetermined

time intervals.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which.the
nutrient sources used as limiting nutrient are selected from

carbon, magnesium, phosphate, sulphate and nitrogen.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which when a
change in limiting nutrient is effected the dilution rate is

decreased.
