<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing digesting liquor having high sulphidity from a spent liquor obtained from digesting cellulosic fiber material, preferably without a conventional causticizing step is described, said method comprising thermal decomposition of the spent liquor under reducing conditions in a reactor at a pressure of from atmospheric pressure up to about 150 bar and at a temperature of about 500 to 1600  DEG C so that a combustible gas phase containing hydrogen sulphide is formed in the reactor and extracted therefrom, and a phase of solid or molten material comprising substantially sodium sulphide which is dissolved in aqueous liquid to produce said digesting liquor. According to the invention hydrogen sulphide is recovered from the gas phase and is returned to the reactor to be present during the thermal decomposition of the spent liquor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing
digesting liquor having high sulphidity from a spent
liquor obtained from digesting cellulosic fiber material, wherein
said
method comprising thermal decomposition of the spent
liquor in at least one reactor at a pressure of from
1.5 bar abs. up to about 150 bar and at a
temperature of about 500째 to 1600째C, said thermal
decomposition being carried out under reducing conditions
without addition of oxygen-containing gas or by the
controlled addition of an oxygen-containing gas in a
quantity corresponding to from nearly 0 up to 80% of the
quantity of oxygen required stoichiometrically for
complete oxidation of substances produced during the
thermal decomposition, whereby a combustible gas phase is
formed in the reactor and extracted therefrom, and a
phase of solid or molten material comprising
substantially sodium sulphide, said solid or molten phase
being dissolved in aqueous liquid to produce said
digesting liquor, said gas phase containing hydrogen
sulphide.During combustion of spent liquor from the sulphate pulp
industry, for instance, two partial goals are aimed at,
the first being that the organic wood substance released
is combusted so that its chemical energy is converted to
useful thermal and electric energy and the second being
that the inorganic chemicals used shall be recovered and
converted to active form. This means, among other things,
that the sulphur shall be recovered in sulphide form,
which requires under-stoichiometric combustion, while the
energy recovery requires over-stoichiometric conditions.
This means that two opposing processes must be performed
simultaneously in one and the same combustion chamber 
which, with conventional soda recovery unit technology,
results in optimizing problems.The inorganic part recovered from the soda recovery unit,
the melt, is dissolved to green liquor and consists of a
plurality of chemical compounds. Most of these compounds
consist of sodium carbonate and also sodium sulphide, the
latter constituting the first one of the recovered active
digesting chemicals in the white liquor. However, the
cycle is not a hundred per cent efficient and some of the
digesting chemicals are obtained in inactive form,
thereby constituting ballast in the white liquor.
Preparation of the white liquor is the last step in the
recovery of chemicals. Here the sodium carbonate in the
green liquor is converted to sodium hydroxide by the
reaction with calcium oxide (CaO), i.e. caustic lime. The
second one of the two active

<CLAIMS>
A method of preparing digesting liquor having high sulphidity from a spent liquor obtained from digesting cellulosic
fiber material in making sulphate or sulphite pulps, said method comprising thermal decomposition of the spent

liquor in at least one reactor at a pressure of from 1.5 bar abs. up to about 150 bar and at a temperature
of about 500째 to 1600째C, said thermal decomposition being carried out under reducing conditions without addition

of oxygen-containing gas or by controlled addition of an oxygen-containing gas in a quantity corresponding to from
nearly 0 up to 80% of the quantity of oxygen required stoichiometrically for complete oxidation of substances

therefrom, and a phase of solid or molten material comprising substantially sodium sulphide, said solid or

molten phase being dissolved in aqueous liquid to produce said digesting liquor, said gas phase containing hydrogen
sulphide, characterized in that hydrogen sulphide is recovered from the gas phase extracted and is returned

to the reactor to be present during the thermal decomposition of the spent liquor, and that the quantity of hydrogen
sulphide returned is adjusted so that the mole ratio between sodium supplied by the spent liquor and sulphur

supplied partly by the spent liquor and partly by said return of hydrogen sulphide amounts to 4:1 and below.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that said mole ratio preferably amounts to 2.8:1 and below, most 
preferably 1.5:1 and below.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said recovery and return of hydrogen sulphide are
effected in a closed recirculation loop.
A method as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the pressure in said reactor is higher than 1.5
bar abs. and that said mole ratio is less than and equal to 1:1, respectively.
A method as claimed in any of claims 1-4, characterized in that substantially all hydrogen sulphide is recovered-and

A method as claimed in any of claims 1-6, characterized in that all or a part of the returned hydrogen sulphide gas
is utilized as atomizing agent for the spent liquor.
A method as claimed in any of claims 1-7, characterized in that additional sulphur is added through a secondary
sulphur source during the starting-up stage in order to achieve a predetermined mole ratio between sodium and

sulphur and during operation to maintain said predetermined value in the event of sulphur losses, or in order to
change the mole ratio during operation to an even lower value, resulting in an equivalent increase in the partial

pressure of the hydrogen sulphide.
A method as claimed in any of claims 1-8, characterized in that a first part of the hydrogen sulphide gas extracted
and recovered from said reactor is returned to said reactor and a second part is conveyed to a second, similar

reactor being supplied with preferably the same spent liquor for the recovery of a first digesting liquor having a
high sulphidity and a second digesting liquor having a lower sulphidity, different partial pressure of the hydrogen

sulphide gas being maintained in the two reactors and a lower and higher Na:S mole ratio, respectively, within the
specified limits thus being maintained in the first reactor and the second reactor, respectively.
A method as claimed in any of claims 1-9, characterized in that said measures including extraction of a combustible
gas, recovery therefrom of hydrogen sulphide and return of hydrogen sulphide to the reactor and, when applicable,

transfer to a second reactor are carried out continuously.
