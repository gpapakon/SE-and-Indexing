<ABSTRACT>
A platinum catalyst which is prepared by reacting a 
platinum halide with an organic compound having at least one 

-C≡C- group in the presence or absence of a base to form a 
complex which promotes the addition of silicon-bonded 

hydrogen atoms to silicon-bonded aliphatic unsaturated 
hydrocarbon groups in the presence of no-clean flux.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a platinum catalyst 
and more particularly a curable organopolysiloxane 
composition containing a platinum catalyst which is not 
inhibited by no-clean flux. When electrical components are connected together, for 
example, to form a circuit board, the electrical components 
are very susceptible to various contaminants such as dirt 
and moisture, particularly if they are stored for a 
considerable period of time. Additionally, the components 
are subject to various contaminants and moisture and may be 
damaged when they are attached to a substrate such as a 
circuit board. To avoid this problem, coatings have been 
applied to cover the components or circuit board containing 
the electrical components. The electrical components and/or circuit boards have 
been coated with organopolysiloxane compositions to protect 
the components from moisture, contamination and damage. 
However, it has been found that organopolysiloxane 
compositions which cure by the addition of silicon bonded 
hydrogen atoms to organopolysiloxanes having olefinic 
unsaturation in the presence of a platinum catalyst do not 
cure at the interface of the metallic connectors. It is 
believed that the no-clean flux, i.e., flux which is not 
removed after soldering electrical components, inhibits 
curing of these organopolysiloxane compositions.  
 Therefore, this invention relates to a platinum 
catalyst and a one-component organopolysiloxane composition 
containing a hydrosilation catalyst which may be applied to 
circuit boards and/or hybrid circuitry to form a curable 
coating thereon. Organopolysiloxanes which are curable by the reaction 
of silicon-bonded, terminally unsaturated olefinic radicals 
and silicon bonded hydrogen atoms in the presence of 
hydrosilation catalysts such as platinum compounds and 
complexes thereof are well known and are disclosed, for 
example, in U.S. 3,419,593 to Willing and U.S. 4,450,283 to 
McAfee et al. Platinum catalysts which have been employed to promote 
the hydrosilation reactions such as the addition of 
organosilicon compounds containing ≡SiH groups to 
organosilicon compounds containing aliphatic unsaturation 
are complexes such as described in U.S. 3,775,452 to 
Karstedt, in which an unsaturated organosilicon compound is 
reacted with a platinum halide and thereafter treating the 
resultant mixture with a base to remove the available 
inorganic halogen. Another platinum complex which may be used in the 
hydrosilation reactions is described in U.S. 4,603,215 to 
Ch
