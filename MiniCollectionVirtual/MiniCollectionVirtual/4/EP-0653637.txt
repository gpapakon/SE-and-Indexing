<ABSTRACT>
A dry, removable analytical element can be 
used to detect chemiluminescent signals produced from 

the reaction of peroxidase and a chemiluminescent 
detection system. The analytical element contains at 

least two layers, the outer layer being non-tacky and 
water-soluble or water-permeable, and used to contact a 

gel plate or transblotting membrane in which multiple 
analytes are located. The resulting signal can be 

recorded using a photosensitive element. Test kits 
include the various packaged components needed to use 

the analytical element for analyte detection. Within 
the element are critical amounts of oxidase and an 

oxidase substrate for highly sensitive analyte 
detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the determination
of analytes using dry, removable analytical elements
and test kits for clinical analysis, or biological or
biomedical research. In particular, it relates to dry,
removable analytical elements, test devices, test kits
and methods for detecting peroxidase-labeled analytes
using chemiluminescent reagent systems.A variety of analytical procedures have been
developed for the separation and identification of
different molecular species present in a specimen.
Separation is generally accomplished by applying the
specimen to a water-containing solid medium and
inducing molecular separation of the species within the
medium. In particular, chromatography and
electrophoresis have been employed, both of which
provide separation of different molecular species. The
separation medium is often called a chromatographic
medium or electrophoretic plate. In such processes, a
variety of reagents which interact with one or more
analytes in the specimen may also be applied to the
medium before, during or after the separation process
to assist in separation or identification of the
analytes.The detection of analytes with labeled
reagents (such as labeled probes or antibodies) is a
commonly used method in research and clinical
laboratories. Various labels have been used, including
magnetic particles, radioisotopes and enzymes, with
horseradish peroxidase being one of the most common
labels. Transparent, removable elements useful for
producing a colorimetric signal in response to multiple 
analytes labeled with peroxidase are described in US-A-5,047,322
and are available from International
Biotechnologies, Inc. as ENZYGRAPHIC™ WEB.While these elements have provided
considerable advantages over the use of radioisotopes
or magnetic particles as labels, there is a need for
further improvement in sensitivity and a means to
provide a permanent record of generated signal. The
use of colorimetric signals may be suitable for
immediate evaluation, but dyes tend to fade and
prohibit the formation of a relatively permanent
record.It is believed that chemiluminescent assay
systems would provide increased sensitivity, but
current systems have several disadvantages. They
require the use of wet chemistry reagents to promote
the enzymatic reaction. Wet chemistry may also require
dilutions of reagents, thereby reducing the sensitivity
of the assay, and the handling of potentially hazardous
chemicals.US-A-4,231,754 describes chemiluminescent
analytical devices having multiple reagent layers which
