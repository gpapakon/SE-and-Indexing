means, wherein a turn table (1) has plural penetrated holes 

comprising dies (2...) provided at fixed intervals in ring-like 
arrangement, each hole (2) is provided with a pair of 

mallets (3, 4) above and under the hole (2), each pair of 
mallets (3, 4) are rotated together with the turn table (1) 

and execute piston operation so that tablets (
J
) are 
continuously produced by compressing pharmaceutical material 

(
m
) filled in the die (2). The rotary-type tabletting 
machine is provided with a spraying chamber (10) with an 

upper open end for inserting an upper punch (3) and 
enclosing the die (2) when the turn table (1) moves to a 

rotation position (e) which is after a rotation position (d) 
where a molded tablet (
J
) is discharged and before a 
rotation position (a) where pharmaceutic
al material (
m
) is 
filled in the die (2), a spray (11) connected with the 

spraying chamber (10) for spraying lubricant (
K
) in the 
spraying chamber (10), and pulsating air generating means 

(12) connected with the spraying chamber (10) for diffusing 
the lubricant (
K
) sprayed in the spraying chamber (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement of a 
rotary-type tabletting machine with lubricant spraying means 
wherein drug tablets are continuously produced. More 
particularly it relates to a rotary-type tabletting machine 
with an automatic spray for spraying lubricant uniformly on 
an upper punch, a lower punch, and a die when pharmaceutical 
material is compressed and tabletted as drug tablets so as 
to heighten the quality of the tablets. Conventionally, such kind of tabletting machine has 
been proposed in JP-P-41-11273 and JP-A-56-14098. According to the tabletting machine in JP-P-41-11273, 
material to be compressed and tabletted m is filled in a die 
2e of a turn table 1e as shown in Fig.7(b) and the material 
m is compressed and tabletted as drug tablets by means of an 
upper punch 3e and a lower punch 4e as shown in Fig.7(c). Lubricant K is sprayed from a nozzle 60 for spraying 
lubricant against the lower punch surface 31 of the upper 
punch 3e and against an upper punch surface 41 of the lower 
punch 4e as shown in Fig. 7(a) before the material is filled 
in the die. According to the tabletting machine in JP-A-56-14098, 
lubricant K in a feeder for fine powdered lubricant 50  
 
provided above a punch 2e is fed to a lubricant supplier 51. 
The lubricant K is fed inside of the die 2e as shown in 
Fig. 8(a) and placed on an upper punch surface 41 of a lower 
punch 4e as shown in Fig.8(b). Then, compressed air is 
injected from a nozzle 61 provided in a spraying chamber 52 
into the lower punch 4e. The lubricant K on the lower punch 
4e is blown away upwardly to be diffused and the diffused 
lubricant adheres to the inside surface 21 of the die 2e and 
the lower punch surface 31 of the upper punch 3e. Such a tabletting machine of outer lubricant spray type 
doesn't need to mix the lubricant with the material m. 
Further, the problem such that the material m adheres to the 
upper punch 3e, the lower punch 4e or other parts can be 
prevented. Therefore, the quality of the tablets can be 
improved. However, in the conventional tabletting machine 
(Fig.7), the lubricant K is injected in vertical direction 
from the nozzle 60 provided above the die 2e. According to 
such a mechanism, the lubricant K can't be sprayed uniformly 
against the inside surface 21 of the die 2e positioned in 
the same direction as the injecting direction of the 
lubricant K. The attached lubricant is dense in the center of the 
surface to which the lubricant K is sprayed, on the other 
hand, the attached lubricant of
