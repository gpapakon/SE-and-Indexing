<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for acoustically analyzing a structure (5) 
having distributed characteristics comprises a first 

acoustic waveguide (14) for transmitting an acoustic 
signal through a portion of the structure, and a second 

acoustic waveguide (16) for receiving a reflected acoustic 
signature of the structure and transmitting the acoustic 

signature to a sensor (18). The sensor (18) produces an 
output that corresponds to the acoustic signature. The 

apparatus and methods are particularly adaptable to 
detecting distributed structural characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to apparatus and methods 
for structural analysis, and more particularly to structural 
analysis apparatus and methods that use acoustic signals for 
detecting structural characteristics. The use of acoustic energy to detect surface flaws in 
structures is well known. Acoustic energy transmitted through 
the structure towards a sensor or target is reflected at 
defect sites, thereby reducing the amount of acoustic energy 
that is transmitted to the sensor. Time domain analysis can 
also be used to determine the approximate location of the 
defect with respect to the acoustic source and sensor. Structural damage or irregularities or other 
characteristics can be detected due to the fact that such 
characteristics are manifested as a non-homogeneous region 
that will at least partially reflect acoustic waves. For 
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,586,381 illustrates an ultrasonic 
transducer which has respective ends of a source waveguide and 
a sensor waveguide placed in contact with a structure to be 
analyzed. The presence of a defect in the structure between 
the two waveguides is apparent as a variation in the amplitude 
of the sensor output signal. U.S. Patent No. 4,481,821 
discloses an electro-elastic crack detector which uses a 
magnetostrictive delay line arranged parallel to a current 
carrying line. The presence of a crack in the surface being 
inspected produces transverse eddy currents which 
magnetostrictively induce acoustic pulses in the delay line 
which are detected by an ultrasonic sensor coupled to the end 
of the delay line to indicate the location of the crack. Although such devices can detect structural defects by 
use of waveguides in proximity to the structure, various 
aspects of the known systems present design limitations 
restrict applications, particularly to complex structures such  
 
as aircraft. For example, the use of eddy currents for 
detecting defects may be unsuitable in some applications and 
difficult to interpret the return signals. Also, having a 
system wherein only the ends of waveguides are used for 
detecting defects does not easily permit detection for 
distributed structural analysis. In many applications, 
defects other than on the surface of the structure need to be 
detected. The objectives exist, therefore, for apparatus and 
methods for structural analysis that can conveniently use 
acoustic energy for detecting structural characteristics, 
especially for performing distributed structural analysis. In view of the
