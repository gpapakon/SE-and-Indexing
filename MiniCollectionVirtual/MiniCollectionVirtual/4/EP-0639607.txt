<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for sequentially degrading at least a portion of a 
polymer of backbone repeating units, the polymer having a terminal repeating unit 

comprised of a nucleophile and a backbone carbonyl carbon distant from the 
nucleophile, comprising the steps of first initiating attack of said nucleophile upon 

said backbone carbonyl carbon by raising the energy level to activate said 
nucleophile for said attack. Secondly, forming a ring comprising the terminal 

repeating unit, thereby simultaneously releasing the ring and generating a 
shortened polymer having a terminal repeating unit capable of nucleophile attack 

upon the backbone carbonyl carbon and, lastly, maintaining the reaction conditions 
necessary for repeating steps a and b until the portion of the polymer desired is 

degraded. In a related embodiment, polyamide nucleic acid (PNA) sequences can be 
determined by generating a nested set of polymer fragments, each fragment having 

N-x repeating units where N is the total number of repeating units in the parent 
polymer and x is the number of degradation cycles the fragment has been subjected 

to, and then analyzing the nested set of polymer fragments to determine polymer 
sequence. An apparatus embodying the method of sequential degradation is also 

described. Analysis may be by MALD-TOF.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the field of polymer and synthetic nucleic
acids chemistry. In particular, the invention concerns the degradation and
sequence determination of polymers, particularly peptide nucleic acids (PNAs)
which sequentially eliminate terminal residues.Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are recently discovered synthetic polyamides
which are promising candidates for the sequence-specific regulation of DNA
expression and for the preparation of gene targeted drugs. See European Patent
applications EP 92/01219 and 92/01220. PNAs are biopolymer hybrids which
possess a peptide-like backbone to which the nucleobases of DNA are attached.
Specifically, PNAs are synthetic polyamides comprised of repeating units of the
amino acid, 2-aminoethylglycine to which adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine
are attached through a methylene carbonyl group. The polymers are neutral in
charge and water soluble. Complementary sequences of PNA bind to DNA with
high specificity to give both double and triple helical forms. Surprisingly, PNA-DNA
hybrids are more stable than the native double stranded DNA. Consequently,
PNAs are promising candidates for application to the multifaceted field of DNA 
manipulation. See Nielsen, Peter E., et al., Science 254: 1497-1500 (1991). There is
presently no known technique for sequencing PNA once it has been synthesized.DNA, polypeptides and proteins are naturally occurring biopolymers which
can be routinely sequenced by well understood methods. Because PNA is a hybrid
biopolymer possessing both nucleic acid and polypeptide-like structure, it is logical
to evaluate DNA and protein sequencing methods for application to the
sequencing of PNA.DNA may be sequenced by either the Maxam & Gilbert or Sanger sequencing
methods. See Stryer, L., Biochemistry, W.H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco (1981)
pp. 591-93. Additionally, short DNA oligomers have been sequenced by the
mobility-shift (wandering spot) method. See Gait, M.J. Oligonucleotide Synthesis,
IRL Press, NY (1990) pp. 135-36. Polypeptides and proteins are sequenced from their
amine terminus by Edman degradation. See Stryer, L., Biochemistry, W.H.
Freeman and Co., San Francisco (1981) pp. 24-27. Further, several new methods
have been described for carboxy terminal sequencing of polypeptides. See Inglis,
A.S., Anal. Biochem. 195: 183-96 (1991). Moreover, the sequencing of polypeptides
has also been described by generating a nested (sequence defining) set of fragments
followed by mass analysis. See Chait, Brian, T. et al.,
