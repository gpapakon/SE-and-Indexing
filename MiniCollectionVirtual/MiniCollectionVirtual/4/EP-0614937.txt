<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reinforced polyolefinic 
thermoplastic compositions. More in particular, the present invention relates to 
reinforced polyolefinic thermoplastic compositions adapted to 
be fabricated into articles having mechanical properties of 
resilience, especially at temperatures lower than 0°C, that 
are more superior than those of the corresponding un-reinforced 
polyolefinic compositions. As is known, polyolefins are used in a wide variety of 
end uses including in the form of films, fibres, moulded or 
thermoformed articles, pipes and/or coatings. In some of these 
end-uses, especially when the polyolefin is fabricated 
into shaped articles by moulding techniques, it is requested 
that the article to be moulded exhibits stiffness and toughness 
properties that are superior to those obtainable from 
the starting polyolefin alone. Many techniques for the modication of the properties of 
polyolefins are known and described in the literature; they 
include the cross-linking of the polymer or the incorporation 
of additives, such as for example elastomers, or fillers such 
as for example glass fibers, kaolin, mica, oxides, carbonates 
of the second and third group Periodic System metals and so 
forth, into the polymeric matrix. Generally, the polyolefinic  
 
compositions reinforced with fillers tend to exhibit a higher 
stiffness than that of the starting polymer alone as well as 
an improved dimensional stability of the end products. It is known, however, that the polyolefins, due to their 
apolar character, are not suited for being reiforced by inorganic 
additives or fillers; in fact, the increase in stiffness 
and dimensional stability is usually accompanied by a 
decrease in other important properties including toughness, 
resilience and so forth. In order to obviate such a drawback it had been suggested 
either to modify the olefinic polymer by grafting monomers 
having polar groups onto the hydrocarbon chain, or by 
using a so-called "adhesion promoter", namely a compound 
which imply an increased adhesion or bonding between the filler 
and the polymeric matrix. Thus, for example, G.B. Patent Nos. 1,110,930 and 
1,177,200 disclose reinforced compositions comprising a polyolefin, 
an inorganic filler and an organosilane containing a 
hydrolysable group capable of reacting with the hydroxyl 
groups present in the inorganic filler. Czechoslovak Patent No. 192,875 discloses mixtures of 
polyethylene and kaolin modified by a basic silane. U.S. Patent No. 3,956,230 discloses
