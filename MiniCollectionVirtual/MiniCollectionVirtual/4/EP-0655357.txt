A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
for vehicles, which in particular is mounted in the roof of 

cab-type vehicles, having at least one blower and air ducts 
which are disposed on the intake side (intake ducts) and/or on 

the delivery side (air distribution ducts) of the blower, 
characterised in that the apparatus has air ducts (20) which 

are produced in two shells in a double deep-drawing process 
and which form at least part of the air ducts (20). 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to Claim 1, characterised in that a support 

structure (14) for supporting the blower (16) and/or heat 
exchanger (18) and/or vaporiser is formed in two shells in a 

double deep-drawing process. 
A heating, ventilation and air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that at least part of the air ducts (20) is provided in a 
support structure (14) and the support structure (14) is 

partly of single-shell and partly of double-shell construction 
and in the single-shell zones has substantially double the 

wall thickness of that in the double-shell zones. 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that the part of the air ducts (20) formed in a double deep-drawing 
process forms a respective closed chamber which, on 

the one side, is bounded by the blower (16) and, on the other 
side, by air-intake openings (34) and/or nozzles (48,64). 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in  

 
that the apparatus (10) is constructed from two panels or 

sheets (22,24), in particular of plastics material, which can 
be deep-drawn and welded together and which form the air ducts 

(20) in spaced apart zones and are welded together laterally 
of the air ducts. 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that spaced apart zones of panels or sheets (22,24), which 
form the apparatus (10), extend substantially horizontally, 

wherein the material thickness of zones extending with a 
vertical component can be reduced by the deep-drawing process. 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that the upper (22) of the two panels or sheets (22,24) which 
form the apparatus (10) is formed as a support structure (14) 

for the blower (16), heat exchanger (18) and/or vaporiser, and 
separates air ducts (26) on the intake side from air ducts 

(32) on the delivery side. 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that the air ducts (20) comprise a pressure-distribution 
chamber (46) which is provided on the outlet side of the 

blower (16) and, in particular, has support turrets (52,54), 
for the formation of which the two panels or sheets (22,24) 

project so as to contact one another. 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that in the head region of the driver of the vehicle the 
panels or sheets (22,24) forming the apparatus (10) are drawn 

upwards to form a substantially horizontal double wall. 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that an intake duct (26), which in particular is of large 
area, is provided between the upper panel or sheet (22) of two  

 
panels or sheets (22,24) forming the apparatus (10) and a roof 

outer skin (28) of the vehicle, and the upper panel or sheet 
(22) is spaced apart from the roof outer skin (28). 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that in per se known manner roof-supporting body pillars (66) 
are provided for connecting leads,
 for example for a heat 
exchanger (18), a vaporiser and electric leads for the blower 

(16) and, in particular, one body pillar (66) is connected at 
its upper end to an air-distribution duct so that it can 

direct air towards the driver's foot region. 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that the lower panel or sheet (24) of two panels or sheets 
(22,24) forming the apparatus (10) is provided with insulating 

material, in particular in the form of soft foam. 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that a support structure (14) of the apparatus (10) is 
provided to accommodate control elements for the heating 

and/or air-conditioning, and also in particular for auxiliary 
appliances, such as loudspeakers, radio and similar equipment. 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that markings are applied for punching out in a double deep-drawing 
process in the apparatus (10). 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that a predetermined breaking point and/or a film hinge is 
provided so as to form, in particular, a flap (40) for 

switching between fresh air and recirculated air in the 
apparatus (10).  

 
A heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning apparatus 
according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 

that a housing of the filter (36), with which an intake duct 
(26) is covered, is secured to a support structure (14), in 

particular adhered thereto.
