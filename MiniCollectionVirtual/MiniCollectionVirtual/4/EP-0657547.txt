<ABSTRACT>
An improvement in the 
conventional antithrombin III 

activity assay, whereby sample 
dilution can be dispensed 

with and the effect of heparin 
cofactor II can be evaded. 

The assay method comprises 
effecting the reaction of 

antithrombin with thrombin 
in the presence of heparin 

and a salt which is used in 
a concentration of 0.2-0.9M 

instead of 0.2M which has been 
usual heretofore.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
determination of antithrombin III (hereinafter abbreviated as
ATIII) activity in body fluids. More specifically, it relates
to an improved method for the determination of ATIII activity
in body fluids comprising reacting a sample with thrombin in
the presence of heparin and a salt and then measuring a color
developed from a chromogenic substrate to determine the
remaining thrombin activity.ATIII is a serine protease inhibitor present in
blood in a large amount (20 to 30 mg/dl) and is known as a
blood coagulation inhibitor. Blood coagulation takes place
by an amplification reaction due to cascade-like function of
many proteases. In the final stage of blood coagulation,
thrombin thus formed converts fibrinogen into fibrin and, in
addition, thrombin activates blood coagulation factor XIII.
The activated blood coagulation factor XIII forms
crosslinkages between fibrins to form thrombi. A most
important regulator of this formation of thrombi is ATIII and 
ATIII binds to thrombin and proteases which participate in
blood coagulation such as blood coagulation factor X and the
like to inhibit them. When ATIII in blood is lowered, thrombi
are liable to be formed. Therefore, lowering of ATIII in
blood causes trouble. It has been known that lowering of
ATIII in blood occurs by, for example, low nutriture, severe
hepatic diseases, coagulation sthenia such as diffuse
intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute thrombosis and the 
like, nephrotic syndrome, and congenital ATIII deficiency or
abnormality. Then, ATIII is an important indication in
clinical diagnosis.As methods for the determination of ATIII, immunological
methods for the determination of immunizing doses,
methods using fibrinogen or chromogenic substrates, and
methods using ATIII deficient plasma containing coagulation
factors participating in extrinsic reactions have already been
known. We have invented a method using ATIII deficient plasma
containing coagulation factors participating in extrinsic
reactions (PCT/JP89/00173; and Thrombosis Research, Vol. 57,
729-736 (1990)). In this method, ATIII can be simply, easily
and accurately determined by measuring a blood coagulation
time with minimum influence of heparin co-factor II (hereinafter
abbreviated as HCII). However, since a blood coagulation
time is measured in this method, it is difficult to apply the
method to general automatic analyzers.At present, methods using chromogenic substrates are
widely used because they are readily applicable to automatic
analy

<CLAIMS>
A method for the determination of antithrombin
III activity which comprises adding a given excess amount of

thrombin to a sample, reacting them in the presence of heparin
and a salt, and then measuring a remaining thrombin activity

with a chromogenic substrate which develops a color by the
reaction with thrombin, the concentration of said salt being

more than 0.20M to not more than 0.90M.
