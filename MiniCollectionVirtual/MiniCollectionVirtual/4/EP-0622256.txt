<ABSTRACT>
The vehicle heating circuit comprises feed, return, circulating pump and heat exchange under thermostat control. The independent heater (7) lies in the return line (5a) upstream of the bypass (6) and the heat carrier output can be pre-set such that the thermostat valve (9) switches automatically between circuit variant as a function of the pre-set output temp. The valve (9) can be bypassed depending on the pressure in a first branch of the feed line (3a). The heat carrier output temp. is set by a continuous heat control or by a flow regulator or by an internal heater control. The pre-set temp. is set either side of the opening temp. of the valve, and the valve closes the feed line (3a) from the bypass entry below the opening temp. of the thermostat. There is a nonreturn valve to block possible return of the heat carrier from valve to return line via the bypass.

A heating circuit of a vehicle with a heater (7) 
independent of the engine, with a feed line (3a, 3b) 

which, for heating an interior (32), connects a heat 
exchanger (4) to an internal combustion engine (1) 

which is provided with a circulating pump (2), and 
which has a return line (5a, 5b) for returning a liquid 

heat carrier from the heat exchanger (4) to the 
internal combustion engine (1) and with a bypass line 

(6) connecting the feed line (3b) to the return line 
(5a) and with a thermostatic valve (9) which opens and 

closes as a function of the temperature of the heat 
carrier and which controls the flow of heat carrier 

through the bypass line (6) and the internal combustion 
engine (1), characterised in that the heater (7) which 

is independent of the engine is disposed in the return 
line (5a) upstream of the branch of the bypass line (6) 

and in that the outlet temperature (T
A
) of the heat 
carrier from the heater (7) can be regulated to at 

least one predeterminable level on the basis of which 
the thermostatic valve (9) automatically and regardless 

of temperature controls various alternative circuits 
and whereby the thermostatic valve (9) can be bypassed 

by a device (23, 24) as a function of the pressure in 
a first branch of the feed line (3a). 
A heating circuit according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the outlet temperature (T
A
) is controlled by 
means of a continuous heat output regulating 

arrangement. 
A heating circuit according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the outlet temperature (T
A
) is 
regulated by a through-flow control arrangement. 
A heating circuit according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the predeterminable level 

of the outlet temperature (T
A
) can be adjusted at a  
 

control device (30) on the heater (7) by means of a 
positioning element (31) disposed in the interior (32). 
A heating circuit according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the predeterminable level 

of the outlet temperature (T
A
) is below the opening 
temperature (T
O
) of the thermostatic valve (9). 
A heating circuit according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the predeterminable level of the 

outlet temperature (T
A
) is above the temperature (T
O
) 
at which the thermostatic valve opens. 
A heating circuit according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the thermostatic valve 

(9) closes the feed line (3a) upstream of the point at 
which the bypass line (6) enters and below the opening 

temperature (T
O
). 
A heating circuit according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that a non-return valve (28) 

is provided to prevent a flow of heat carrier from the 
thermostatic valve (9) via the bypass line (6) to the 

return line (5a, 5b). 
A heating circuit according to Claim 8, characterised 
in that the non-return valve (28) forms one structural 

unit together with the thermostatic valve (9). 
A heating circuit according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that as a pressure-dependent 

means of bypassing the thermostatic valve (9) there are 
in a main valve plate (21) thereof ports (22) which can 

be occluded by means of a secondary valve plate (23) 
biased by a spring (24).
