<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a continuous process for 
the manufacture of 2,5-dihydrofurans by the isomerization 
of γ,δ-epoxyalkenes in the liquid phase. More 
specifically, this invention pertains to the continuous 
isomerization of γ,δ-epoxyalkenes in the presence of a 
catalyst system comprising an onium iodide compound and 
a Lewis acid and a process solvent comprising the 
2,5-dihydrofuran product of the process and an oligomer 
of the γ,δ-epoxyalkene reactant. The preparation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene by the 
selective monoepoxidation of butadiene is described in 
U.S. Patents 4,897,498 and 4,950,773. 2,5-Dihydrofuran 
may be hydrogenated as described in U.S. Patent 
4,962,210 to tetrahydrofuran, a valuable compound useful 
as a chemical process solvent and as an intermediate in 
the preparation of polymers such as poly(tetramethylene 
ether)glycol. U.S. Patents 3,932,468 and 3,996,248 disclose the 
production of 2,5-dihydrofurans by the rearrangement of 
γ,δ-epoxyalkenes, i.e., unsubstituted and substituted 
butadiene monoepoxide compounds, with a homogeneous 
catalyst system comprising hydrogen iodide or hydrogen 
bromide and a transition metal Lewis acid in an organic 
solvent. This process suffers from a number of 
disadvantages such as the use of corrosive hydrogen 
halides and the need for expensive, high-boiling 
tertiary amide solvents, e.g., N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 
to dissolve the transition metal Lewis acid. We have 
found that the processes of U.S. Patents 3,932,468 and 
3,996,248 also converts a significant amount of 
3,4-epoxy-1-butene to crotonaldehyde.  
 U.S. Patent 5,082,956 discloses processes for the 
preparation of 2,5-dihydrofurans by isomerizing 
γ,δ-epoxyalkenes in the presence of catalyst systems 
comprising certain onium iodide compounds and, 
optionally, an inorganic Lewis acid and/or certain 
organometallic halide compounds. The disclosed 
processes include vapor phase processes wherein a vapor 
of the epoxyalkene reactant is passed through a reaction 
zone containing the catalyst system which is in the form 
of a molten salt or a film deposited on a non-acidic 
support material. This gas phase process employs an 
inert gas diluent such as nitrogen or helium and is 
conducted at a temperature above the melting point of 
the catalyst components, typically at a temperature of 
130 to 150°C. EP-A-0412366 discloses processes for the 
preparation of 2,5-dihydrofurans by isomerizing 3,4-epoxy-1-alkenes 
in the presence of (i) a catalyst system 
comprising an alkali metal
