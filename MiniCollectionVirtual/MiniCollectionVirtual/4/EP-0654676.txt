<ABSTRACT>
The frequency spectrum of a received signal of an acoustic locating device (position-finding system) has fundamental frequencies and harmonics of them which are intended to draw conclusions therefrom about the vehicle whose radiated noise has been received. Fundamental frequencies are determined from frequencies of three frequency lines having the greatest amplitude values, and their differences. In order to obtain a statement on the quality of the determination as well, these fundamental frequencies and/or deviations of the differences from the fundamental frequencies and/or deviations of the frequencies of harmonics of the fundamental frequencies and/or amplitude values are assessed, according to the invention, as a linguistic variable with association functions and are linked to one another in accordance with rules which can be predetermined, on a fuzzy logic basis, and a credibility factor is derived for the determination of the fundamental frequencies. This method can be used advantageously for signals received from propeller-driven watercraft and aircraft as well as from wheeled vehicles and track-laying vehicles.
