<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a cross-linked gel-like polyvinyl-based composition of matter having unique elasticity. The composition is capable of being used as a kneading compound, as well as being moldable, stretchable, and bouncing, for use in play activities. The composition is based on a cohesive polyvinyl alcohol/polyvinyl pyrrolidone nonadhesive and substantially nondrying binder composition that is appropriate for child use. The invention is also directed to a method of making the instant polyvinyl-based composition of matter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gel-like composition of matter for use as a
play material. The present composition is capable of being used as a play gel, as well
as being moldable, stretchable, and resilient to the point of having bounce
characteristics. Because it is based on a polyvinyl alcohol composition, it is safe and
suitable for use by children if accidentally ingested and can be washed from fabrics
and carpets with water.Through the years, play compositions of different types have been provided by
practitioners in the toy arts to amuse children and adults and to aid in the development
of manual skills and dexterity, as well as creativity. While the variety of such play
material compositions is virtually endless, all generally involve the use of free-forming
or malleable materials, such as oil base or water base gums and gel
compounds which may be manipulated and shaped by the user. Certain materials
have been provided which are moldable and tend to retain their shapes, such as
modeling clay or the like. Others, however, have been provided which are looser and
more free-flowing, such as novelty play materials and compositions. Still others are
gel-like and provide interesting characteristics, such as shaking or quivering similar to
gelatin dessert products.Regardless of the type of play compositions used, it has remained imperative
that such materials be safe for young children. Safety requirements have evolved 
through the years as safety concerns have grown. Generally, safety requirements
mandate that play material compositions be nonirritating to the skin or eyes or the
like, and be nontoxic if ingested. Additional requirements have been expected of
these materials to avoid damage to clothing, upholstery fabric, or carpeting.Play compositions having molding or modeling characteristics by which a
child can represent people or objects are well known and generally comprise products
of mineral origin, i.e., clay products, or vegetable origin, i.e., starch products. These
particular materials are, in general, nonelastic and nonstretchable over significant
lengths. Additionally, these modeling clays are messy and frequently have oils and
other staining ingredients which are difficult to remove from carpets and fabrics.
Elastomeric silicone-based play compositions are known and are essentially designed
to be stretched, as well as to be rolled into a ball which has a high degree of elasticity
or "bounce" under suddenly applied stress. However, silicone-based modeling
compositions or puttys are
