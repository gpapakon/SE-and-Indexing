<ABSTRACT>
A measuring device is described for determining the displacement of a 
movable object in cooperation with a graduation element (13) which is mechanically 

connected to the object whose displacement is to be determined. The graduation element 
(13) comprises at least a track (15) which is formed from a plurality of successive 

grating strips (16) located transversely to the direction of movement of the object. The 
measuring device (1) comprises a radiation source (3), a detector (7) and a reflective 

optical system which comprises at least a collimating element (5). The reflective optical 
system guides the radiation from the radiation source (3) to the graduation element (13) 

and changes it to an elongate radiation beam which is parallel on average in the cross-section 
perpendicular to the grating strips (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a measuring device for determining the
displacement of a movable object in cooperation with a graduation element connected to
the object and having at least a track which is formed from a plurality of successive
grating strips extending transversely to the direction of movement of the object, said
measuring device comprising at least a radiation source for generating radiation and an
associated optical system for converting the radiation into a radiation beam which is
parallel on average and for guiding this radiation beam towards the graduation element,
and a radiation-sensitive detection system for converting radiation from the graduation
element into an electric signal.A measuring device of the type described in the opening paragraph is
known from United States Patent US-A 3,973,119. In the measuring device described in
this Patent a grating mechanically connected to the object is projected on a multiple
photocell detector. This detector comprises a row of strip-shaped, substantially identical
photosensitive cells which are consecutively connected by means of an electric switch to
an electric circuit which processes the signal generated in the photosensitive cells. The
electric switch can ensure that the detector may serve as a reference grating. The
grating is preferably imaged 1:1 on the photosensitive cell array. To introduce a
minimum number of read errors in such an image due to oblique projection of the
grating strips on the detector, the radiation from the radiation source is to be converted
into a scanning beam which is parallel in the cross-section perpendicular to the grating
strips. Parallelism is not required in the cross-section parallel to the grating strips.In the measuring device described in said United States Patent, the
radiation from the radiation source is guided towards a collimator lens via a partially
transparent mirror. The parallel scanning beam formed by the collimator lens is
subsequently incident on the graduation element. After reflection on the graduation
element, the beam travels to the partially transparent mirror via the collimator lens so
that the beam is reflected towards the detector. The known measuring device has the drawback that the optical system for
generating a parallel scanning beam is a combination of standard lenses and mirrors and
consequently occupies a relatively large space. A further drawback is the low light
output. The partially transparent mirror only passes approximately half the radiation
incident thereon, so that only
