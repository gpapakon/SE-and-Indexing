<ABSTRACT>
An electronic apparatus adapted for use of a 
cassette (1) having a first recording medium (2) and a second 

recording medium (17) which differs from the first recording 
medium includes a detecting circuit arranged to detect 

whether the cassette is provided with the second recording 
medium and an ejecting circuit arranged to eject the 

cassette if the cassette is found by the detecting circuit 
to be not provided with the second recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cassette device adapted
for the use of either a cassette having a memory or a
tape or a cassette having no memory.The troublesomeness of arranging and keeping
cassettes in proper order increases according as the
number of cassettes in a household stock increases. As
a result, such an inconvenience that the contents of
records kept in old cassettes become hardly
distinguishable.To solve this problem, it has been contrived to
provide a memory on a cassette, to store such data as the
date of recording, the contents of the record, titles,
comments, a table of contents, etc., and, when
reproducing the record, to read the data stored in the
memory, so that the data of each record can be readily
found and a search can be easily made.WO91/02355, reflecting the preamble of claim 1, describes a cassette including a magnetic
tape recording medium as the principal data storage, and
a solid-state memory device mounted within an otherwise
unused internal space within the cassette. The solid
state memory stores information relating to the content
of the magnetic tape memory, this data being accessed by
a recording and playback apparatus by means of surface 
contacts connected to the solid state memory device.However, if the contents of the record are not
important or in the event of a matter for which it is not
necessary to store data in the memory, the unnecessary
provision of the memory incurs a cost increase.The unnecessary cost increase can be avoided by
having cassettes which are provided with such memories
and cassettes which are provided with no memory in a
commingled state. Actual use of the cassettes of the two
different kinds, however, necessitates making a 
discrimination between the two kinds and conducting
communication only with the memory of the cassette
provided with the memory.It is an object of this invention to provide a
cassette device which is capable of adequately
controlling cassettes of both of the two kinds, one
having a memory and the other having no memory.According to the present invention there is provided
an electronic apparatus adapted for use with a cassette
having a first recording medium and a second, different,
recording medium, comprising:
communication means for communicating with said
second recording medium and including receiving means to
receive data from said second recording medium;control means for controlling communication between
the apparatus and the second recording medium, wherein
the control means is adapted to request data to be read
from

<CLAIMS>
An electronic apparatus adapted for use with a
cassette (1) having a first recording medium (2) and a

second, different, recording medium (17), comprising:

communication means (16) for communicating with said
second recording medium and including receiving means to

receive data from said second recording medium;
control means (14) for controlling communication
between the apparatus and the second recording medium (2,

17), wherein the control means (14) is adapted to request
data to be read from the second recording medium (17)

into the receiving means; and

   
characterised in that
 the control means is operable
to restrict a control related to the second recording

medium (17) if the requested data is absent from the
receiving means.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further including
determining means (14) for determining whether the

cassette (1) is provided with said second recording
medium (17) wherein the communication means (16) is

instructed to read predetermined data from the second
recording medium (17), and said determining means (14)

is arranged to determine that the cassette (1) is not
provided with said second recording medium (17) when the

data recorded on said second recording medium (17) which 
is read out by said communication means (16) does not

coincide with said predetermined data.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising controlling means (13) for controlling said

first recording medium (2) when predetermined data is
read out from said second recording medium (17) within

said predetermined period of time.
An apparatus according to any preceding claim,
wherein the communication means (12, 16) comprises:


first recording means (12, 3) capable of recording
information on said first recording medium (2); and
second recording means (16) capable of recording
information on said second recording medium (17).
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the control
means (14) performs control to allow predetermined

information to be recorded on said second recording
medium (17) by said second recording means (16) when the

cassette (1) is found by said determining means (14) to
be provided with said second recording medium (17).
An apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said
second recording means (16) is arranged to record

information related to the information recorded by said
first recording medium (2). 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, further
comprising a display means (15) , and wherein the control

means (14) controls the display means (15) to make a
display when the determining means (14) decides that the

cassette (1) does not have the second recording means
(17).
An apparatus according to any preceding claim,
wherein said determining means (14) comprises a terminal

(7a, 7b, 7c) which is electrically connectable to said
second recording medium (17).
An apparatus according to any preceding claim,
wherein said first recording medium (2) is a magnetic

tape and said second recording medium (17) is a memory.
An apparatus according to claim 9, wherein said
memory is an EEPROM.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
control related to the second recording medium (17) is

an operation of the apparatus carried out on the basis
of information recorded on the second recording medium.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
control related to the second recording medium (17) is

the communication by said communication means (16). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
control related to the second recording medium (17) is
