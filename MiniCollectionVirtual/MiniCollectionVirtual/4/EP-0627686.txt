<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system administration 
such as a computer system which is designed to operate in a 
network environment. Fig. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a system 
management information setting unit of a computer system 
which performs communication between computers through a 
conventional communication medium: 401 is a client 
computer address input unit which enters the network 
address(internet address) of a client computer , that is 
necessary for performing communication with other computer 
such as a server computer or the like by connecting the 
computer system to the network by means of a communication 
medium; 402 is a client computer address setting unit 
which sets the network address(internet address) entered by 
the client computer address input unit 401 in the computer; 
403 is a client computer address memory which stores the  
 
network address entered by the client computer address 
input unit 401; 407 is a client computer communication 
controller which controls communication with the sever 
computer through the communication medium; 408 is a 
server computer address input unit which enters the 
network address(internet address) being set in the client 
computer into the server computer for communicating with the 
client computer connected newly to the network through a 
communication medium; 409 is a server computer address 
memory which stores the network address entered by the 
server computer address input unit 408; and 410 is a 
server computer communication controller which controls 
communication with the client computer connected to the 
network through the communication medium. The flow of operations of the system management 
information setting unit of the conventional computer 
system constructed as described above is described 
below. To connect a client computer anew to the communication 
medium, the user of the client computer 
enters the network address, such as an IP address or 
the like, using the client computer address input unit 
401. The network address entered by the client 
computer address input unit 401 is set in the client  
 
computer by the client computer address setting unit, 
and stored in the client computer address memory 403. 
To communicate with the client computer which was newly 
connected to the communication medium, the administrator of 
the server computer also enters the network address, 
such as the IP address or the like set in the client 
computer, by using the server computer address input unit 
408. Information

<CLAIMS>
An address acquiring apparatus comprising: 
   an address setting determination unit which 

determines whether setting of a network address is made 
or not in a client computer , the network address being an 

identifier on an network and being given to each computer for 
connecting a computer system to the network; 

   a host name input unit which enters a host name 
which is an identifier for making it easy for a person to 

identify the computer , the host name being registered in 
pairs with the network address , when said address setting 

determination unit has determined that such network address 
has not been set; 

   an address requesting unit which requests a network 
address by sending the host name entered by said host 

name input unit to a server computer storing network addresses 
in pairs with the host names for an entire network; 

   an address receiving unit which determines and receives 
a response of the network address from the server computer; 

   an address information setting unit which sets the 
network address received by said address receiving unit and 

the host name entered by said host name input unit in the 
computer system; and

 
an address information memory which stores the network 

address in pairs with the host name set by said address 
information setting unit. 
An address distributing apparatus comprising: 
   an address acquisition request receiving unit 

which receives a request for acquiring the network 
address sent from an address requesting unit which
 requests 
a network address by transmitting a host name to a server 

computer storing network addresses in pairs with the host 
names for an entire network; 

   an address range specifying unit which specifies 
a range of automatic allocation of the network addresses 

in the server computer; 
   an address generating unit which automatically 

generates the network address within the range specified 
by said address range specifying unit in accordance with 

information received by said address acquisition request 
receiving unit; 

   an address information memory which stores the 
network address generated by said address generating unit in 

pairs with the host name received by said address acquisition 
request receiving unit , in the server computer which manages 

 
network addresses of the entire network; and 

   an address sending unit which takes out the 
network address automatically generated by said address 

generating unit and sends the network address to a 
client computer. 
A network address setting apparatus comprising the 
address acquiring apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 and the 

address distributing apparatus as claimed in Claim 2.
