<ABSTRACT>
A transport device (1) has a driver's cab and a vehicle frame with front-axle and rear-axle assembly and at least one loading platform for transporting vehicles. In order to permit the transport device (1) to be built with a relatively small number of individual components and to be used easily and in diverse forms to transport vehicles of different manufacturers, the transport device has a kit with at least three constructional sections. The first section I (8) is formed from a driver's cab (2), front-axle assembly (4) and a front frame component (15). The second section II (9) comprises a frame connection component (16) and a roadway (17). The third section III (10) is formed from a frame joining component (18), a joining roadway (19) and a rear-axle assembly (5). The different frame components (15, 16, 18) are connected to one another via interfaces (20, 21) in order to form the frame (3) of the vehicle.
