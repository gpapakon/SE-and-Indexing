<ABSTRACT>
A sheet handling device comprising a first roller (5) 
defining a reference surface which defines part of a sheet 

feed path along which sheets are fed. The roller (5) is 
mounted to a support (26) by arms (6) such that under 

normal working conditions the roller is fixed relative to 
the support. The arms (6) are biassed by a spring (12) to 

hold the roller (5) in its fixed position, the spring force 
being such that under abnormal conditions the roller (5) 

moves relative to the support (26) whereby the reference 
surface moves away from its sheet feed path defining 

position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sheet handling device, for 
example for use in a sheet thickness detection device. Sheet handling devices are known for handling sheets 
for a variety of purposes. In many cases, it is necessary 
to monitor the passage of a sheet in order for example to 
count the sheet and/or determine its validity. In these 
and other cases, conventional sheet handling devices 
include a first member defining a reference surface which 
defines part of a sheet feed path along which sheets are 
fed. A typical example of such a sheet handling device is 
a sheet thickness monitoring or detection device. 
Measurement of thickness of sheets such as banknotes is 
often required in order to determine that only single 
sheets are in transit in a system rather than multiple 
sheets. The presence of multiple sheets stuck together may 
result in a miscount, as well as preventing inspection of 
some of those sheets as they pass through the system. An example of a conventional sheet thickness detection 
system is given in British Patent Publication No. GB-A-2241228 
which represents the most relevant prior art. This 
document describes a pair of juxtaposed rollers, one of 
which (the datum roller) is rigidly fixed and the other of 
which (the sensor roller) is free to move. The sensor 
roller is restrained from movement by means of rubber 
inserts so that as a sheet passes through, the rubber 
deflects and movement of the roller is sensed by shoes 
riding on the surface of the roller. The shoes displace a 
sensing element, in this case an LVDT (Linear Variable 
Differential Transformer), which outputs a signal 
corresponding to the note thickness. This system 
encounters a number of problems. The use of shoes on the 
roller gives rise to wear, and the generation of heat by 
friction at high speeds. The effect of wear on the shoes 
is to cause the signal they produce to be different from 
that when there is no wear. The higher the speed the 
greater the problems. The signals generated may also be  
 
altered by the presence of dirt on the shoes. LVDTs 
require careful setting up and may give a different signal 
level from one shoe as from another. In some applications, for example in banknote 
processing apparatus such as sorting or counting apparatus, 
a particular problem arises when monitoring unchecked 
sheets such as used notes. It is quite common for pins or 
staples to be present on the note or for there to be 
adhesive tape or corner folds which affect the sensed 
thickness. It is desirable that

<CLAIMS>
A sheet handling device comprising a first member (5) 
defining a reference surface which defines part of a sheet 

feed path along which sheets are fed, the member being 
mounted to a support (26) by a mounting arrangement (6) 

such that under normal working conditions the member is 
fixed relative to the support, and a second member (15) 

cooperating with the reference surface of the first member 

(5) such that sheets can be fed between the members in use, 
wherein the second member (15) is movable relative to the 

reference surface under normal working conditions in 
response to the thickness of sheets passing between the 

members, characterised in that the mounting arrangement is 
such that under abnormal conditions the first member 

defining the reference surface moves relative to the 
support whereby the reference surface moves away from its 

sheet feed path defining position. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein the second 
member (15) is mounted to a compliant support (1), the 

device further comprising measuring means (2) for measuring 
the strain imparted to the compliant support when a sheet 

passes between the members so as to monitor displacement of 
the second member relative to the first member. 
A device according to claim 2, wherein the compliant 
support (1) comprises one of a cantilevered arm, a ring, 

and a compliant beam fixed at both ends. 
A device according to claim 2 or claim 3, wherein the 
means for measuring strain comprises at least one strain 

gauge (2) mounted to the compliant support (1). 
A device according to any of claims 2 to 4, wherein 
the second member comprises a roller (15). 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the first member comprises a roller (5). 
A device according to claim 5 or claim 6, wherein the 
roller (5,15) comprises a feed roller. 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the mounting arrangement includes biassing means  

 
(12) for biassing the first member (5) to its normal, fixed 

position. 
A device according to claim 8, wherein the biassing 
means comprises a compression spring (12). 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the mounting arrangement includes at least one arm 

(6) pivoted to the support (26). 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the abnormal condition corresponds to the passage 

of an article to or along the reference surface having a 
thickness greater than a predetermined amount.
