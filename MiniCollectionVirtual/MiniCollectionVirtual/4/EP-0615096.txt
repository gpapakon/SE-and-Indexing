<ABSTRACT>
Cooking plateau for a gas device, consisting of one plate-shaped 
part of a heat-resistant material, in which various facilities are 

integrated: the upper surface has one or more recessions for catching 
food; the burner housings and the pan supports constitute a single part 

therewith, as do, preferably the hinges for the cover, the assembly 
plates for the taps, the assembly points for the spark transformer and 

the assembly points for the attachment clamps of the plateau. 
The plateau can consist of a heat-resistant plastic or of aluminium. 
The invention also contains methods for the manufacture of such 
plateaus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cooking plateau for a gas device, in 
which the following functions are achieved: 
food and the like is caught; the burners are connected to gas supplies present under the plateau; pans and the like are supported when they are located above the burners. In the case of customary gas devices each of the said functions is 
achieved as a result of measures which are specially equipped therefor; 
the three measures concerned cooperate with one another in and around 
the cooking plateau. Those measures are: 
a plate-shaped part with a sunken upper surface which serves as a 
catching area for food and the like. Such a plate consists of drawn 
steel, which is generally enamelled in order to promote its resistance 
to chemicals and to high temperatures, and to promote its 
scratch-resistance and in order to give it a desired colour. The part 
is equipped with openings through which, when in use, the burners 
protrude from the under-side, which when in use are connected to gas 
supply lines which open-up under the plate-shaped part. They protrude 
through the plate-shaped part from the under-side with their burner 
housings. A cover is located on a burner housing, which is equipped 
with lateral openings for the out-flow of the gas/air mixture which 
is to be ignited; pan supports, which are situated around the burners and on which, 
when in use, pans and the like can be placed, so that they are located 
above the burners. These cast iron and/or hoop steel pan supports 
are generally parts of the frame or frame parts which are situated 
above the plate-shaped part. As in the case of the plate-shaped 
part they are generally enamelled. Such a frame rests on the (edge 
of) the plate-shaped part. The fact that cooking plateaus consist in this manner of three 
separate parts which each fulfill a function, but cooperate with one 
another, leads to disadvantages: especially technical manufacturing 
problems and problems in assembly. Newly developed techniques with regard to the pressing of heat-resistant  
 
glass into a particular shape, with regard to the injection 
molding of heat-resistant plastics - thermoplastics - with regard to 
the injection molding of aluminium and with regard to deep drawing of 
particular sorts of steel make it possible to avoid the said disadvantages, 
by making an entirely new kind of cooking plateau. Such a 
cooking plateau is characterized in that it consists of a plate-shaped 
part of a heat-resistant material which achieves all of the said functions:
