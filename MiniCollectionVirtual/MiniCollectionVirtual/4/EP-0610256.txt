<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photo-crosslinkable materials based on linear
polyamides and to fibres and films produced from
such materials.The normal effect of radiation on polyamides is to
cause degradation by breaking of the polymer chain. Although the
use of a polyamide in photo-crosslinkable materials is known, the
polyamide itself takes little or no part in the crosslinking,
being only present as a support. In such materials the
photo-crosslinking is produced by a photopolymerisable monomer
containing, for example unsaturated groups as described in US
Patent No 4144073. An improvement can be effected by
additionally providing unsaturated groups grafted onto the
polyamide backbone as described in US Patent No 4421840.Surprisingly, it has now been found that
photo-crosslinking of polyamides can be effected by using a
suitable photo-crosslinking agent without the necessity of the
unsaturated photo-polymerisable groups being present.According to the present invention there
is provided a photo-crosslinkable material comprising a linear
polyamide and a 2-substituted anthraquinone
which has the formula

   where X may be 
ORwhere R is an optionally substituted alkyl group, an
optionally substituted phenyl group or a (meth)acrylyl
groupwhere R is a (meth)acrylyl group and R is hydrogen, an
optionally substituted alkyl group or an optionally
substituted phenyl group;
or
R is hydrogen and R1 is an optionally substituted alkyl
group or an optionally substituted phenyl groupC(O)-Rwhere R is an optionally substituted alkyl group or an
optionally substituted phenyl group, or
is OR1 where R1 is an optionally substituted alkyl
group, an optionally substituted phenyl group or an
optionally substituted vinyl group
The other positions on the anthraquinone ring may be optionally
substituted.Preferably the 2-substituted anthraquinone is
2-acrylamidoanthraquinone (X = NHC(O)CH = CH2), or
2-acryloxyanthraquinone (X = OC(O)CH = CH2), or
2-benzoylaminoanthraquinone (X = NHC(O)C6H5).The photo-crosslinkable material may contain two or
more of the 2-substituted anthraquinones or a mixture of one or
more of the 2-substituted anthraquinones with one or more other
photoinitiator materials.Any polyamide may be used but polyhexamethylene diamine
(more commonly known as nylon 6.6) or polycaprolactam (more
commonly known as nylon 6) is preferred.According to a further aspect of the invention there is
provided a solvent - cast film or a melt spun fibre comprising a
polyamide having incorporated therein, or coated on the surface
thereof,
