<ABSTRACT>
The inductive heating device uses at least 2 inductors (1,2), each supplied with a MF current, the effective sections (7) of the inductor conductor loops extend parallel to one another, with the current flowing in the same direction. The inductors are arranged in opposing pairs, lying on opposite sides of the treated metal goods (3), the currents in their conductor loop sections flowing in opposite directions. Preferably the conductor loop sections of each inductor are located in a single channel in the surface of the inductor core (4,5), or in separate reception grooves, spaced across the surface of each core.
