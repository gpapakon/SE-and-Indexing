<ABSTRACT>
An appliance for monitoring in sterile conditions the rate of flow of a body fluid flowing out of a catheter according to the principle of Pitot has a measurement cell (3) upon which the body fluid is applied from above through an inflow chamber (25). The measurement cell (3) has a measurement chamber (31) separated from the inflow chamber (25) by a partition (26), and a covering part (10) with two ventilation openings (28, 28a) closed by bacteria-proof filters (110, 111) by means of which the measurement chamber (4) and the inflow chamber (25) are ventilated. The measurement cell (3) further contains a Pitot tube (43) that may be connected by a connecting pipe (39) to a pressure gauge (2). The Pitot tube (43) is also sealed by a bacteria-proof filter (60) with respect to the connecting pipe (39). Wetting of the bacteria-proof filters (60, 110) by the liquid to be measured is prevented by the liquid barriers (101, 105) arranged within the central part (9) of the measurement chamber (4) or at the lower end of the Pitot tube (43).
