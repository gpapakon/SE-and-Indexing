<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to textile
cleaning formulations.Powdered cleaning formulations for dry
cleaning carpets and other textiles are known. The
formulations generally contain surfactants, absorbants
and water. In use the powder is brushed into the
carpet fibers; allowed to absorb the soil. After
drying the carpet is then vacuumed thereby removing the
soil laden powder leaving a clean carpet.Various absorbants have been used, ranging
from clays to dried corn cobs, a combination of
cellulose fibers, powdered borax, wood flour and fumed
silica. Both cellulose fibers and borax have been used
as absorbants but not in the same formulation. See
U.S. Patents 4,659,494, 4,834,900 and 4,395,347.Zeolites, natural and synthetic, in
combination with surfactants and organic solvents
(nonaqueous) have also been used in formulations for
dry cleaning textiles. See U.S. Patent 4,648,882.The problem is that such prior art
formulations are not complete cleaning systems. For
example, water must be added before use. Moreover the
formulations are fluffy causing difficulties in filling
containers during manufacture. These powders have very
poor flowing characteristics that make effective
dispersals on carpets difficult.The present invention provides a flowable powder fabric dry
cleaning formulation including powdered cellulose, water and an organic
solvent, characterised in that the formulation comprises:
a) 20 to 50 parts of powdered cellulose having a particle size
of 1 to 150 microns;b) 10 to 25 parts of borax in decahydrate formc) 0 to 10 parts of hydrated amorphous silica; d) 0 to 10.0 parts of one or more anionic
surfactants;e) 0.5 to 10.0 parts of said organic solvent;f) 30.0 to 60 parts water; andg) 0 to 10.0 parts of a zeolite; with the requirement
that at least one of the silica or zeolite be always
present in the composition.In the formulations of this invention up to
70 parts of liquid can be absorbed by the absorbant
components a), b) and c) of the invention. The
composition is flowable allowing even coverage during
dispersal on carpets. It brushes easily into carpets
and is easily vacuumed out of carpets.The formulations comprise a unique absorbant
component in combination with a liquid cleaner
component resulting unexpectedly in a white flowable
powder.The liquid component consists of a mixture of
water, solvents and, optionally anionic surfactants.
Small amounts of fragrances and other adjuncts may also
be blended into the liquid cleaning component.In addition to water present in amount of 30
to 60
