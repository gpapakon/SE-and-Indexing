<ABSTRACT>
In a light emitting device made of a group II-VI semiconductor
of ZnCdSSe or MgZnCdSSe, to facilitate the movement of

electrons or holes from a GaAs substrate (1, 21) to a group II-VI
semiconductor film (4, 24) and to flow the current at a low

voltage, a ZnSe-AlGaAs super lattice layer (3, 23) is formed
between the group II-VI semiconductor film (4, 24) and the GaAs

substrate (1, 21) so that the energy band from the substrate (1,
21) to the group II-VI semiconductor film (4, 24) rises in steps

or gradually. In an device where an N-type semiconductor layer
(12) of the group II-VI semiconductor film (4) is arranged on

the side of the substrate (1), P-type semiconductor films (35,
36, 37) which raise the energy band from the electrode (5) to

the P-type semiconductor layer (13) in steps is formed between
the electrode (5) and the P-type semiconductor layer (13) which

is the top layer of the group II-VI semiconductor film (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor light
emitting device which can be used as a semiconductor laser device, as a blue light emitter which is one of the elements of a display panel
for use in displays of various electronic apparatuses, as a blue
light emitting device (LED) used individually in a display
apparatus, as a signal reading and writing light emitting device
for use in a compact disk (CD) player and a laser disk (LD)
player, and as a light emitting device for use in a bar code
reader.Fig. 1 schematically shows the basic structure of such a
semiconductor light emitting device (see: Nurmikko et al., Ext. Abstracts of the 1992 Int. Conf. on Solid State Devices and Materials, 1992, p 342-344) and the condition of acorresponding energy band. The general structure of the
semiconductor light emitting device is as follows: a semiconductor
film B of a P-N junction structure is formed on the
surface of an N-type semiconductor substrate by MBE (molecular
beam epitaxy)-growing an N-type semiconductor layer B1, an active
layer B2 and a P-type semiconductor layer B3 in this order, and
metal electrodes E1 and E2 are formed on the N-type substrate A
and on the P-type semiconductor layer B3 which is the top layer
of the semiconductor film.As well known, the energy band of the semiconductor device
of the above-described structure is of a configuration such that
the energy levels of the N-type semiconductor film B1 and the P-type 
semiconductor layer B3 are high and an energy level trough
is formed at the active layer B2 which is a P-N junction. Consequently,
when a bias voltage is applied between the electrodes
E2 and E1 in a forward direction, the carriers, i.e. holes h and
electrons e injected by the voltage application recombine by
being shut up in the active layer B2 where the energy level is
low, so that natural light is emitted therefrom. In a semiconductor
laser, when the exciting current exceeds a threshold
value, light resonates between the parallel end surfaces of the
active layer B2 to cause a laser oscillation.Conventionally, in manufacturing a semiconductor light
emitting device which emits blue light, the semiconductor film
B is formed by epitaxially growing a group II-VI semiconductor
of ZnCdSSe or MgZnCdSSe directly on a GaAs substrate A, or
through a group III-V film grown on the GaAs substrate A and
having the same conductivity as that of the GaAs substrate A.Fig. 2 shows a conventional semiconductor light emitting
device. The conventional device shown in the figure is what is
