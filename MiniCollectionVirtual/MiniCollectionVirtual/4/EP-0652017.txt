<ABSTRACT>
The term biomaterial is generally applied to describe a material which can be introduced into the bloodstream or the tissue of the human body, for example infusion, cardiac or balloon-tipped catheters, electrodes for pacemakers or defibrillators, suture material, vascular prostheses, supportive structures for vessels, so-called stents or the like. It is known to coat such biomaterials in order to prevent, in particular, deposition of plasma and cell constituents and hence coagulation. According to the invention, a lacquer-like coating of a blood- and tissue-compatible material having a layer thickness below 100 micrometers, preferably 10 micrometers, is built up and is permanently degraded in the body. Any depositing plasma or cell constituents are liberated upon degradation of this coating material. Moreover, anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory substances may be incorporated in the coating material.

Coating for bio-material which can be introduced into the
bloodstream or into the tissue of the human body, such as

infusion, heart or balloon catheters, electrodes for heart
pacemakers and de-fibrillators, suture material, stents or

the like, with this coating consisting of a coating
material well tolerated by blood and tissue and permanently

degradable in the body, 
characterized in that
 the coating
material is selected so that blood clotting on the bio-material

due to constituents of plasma or cells sticking to
it being prevented by this coating, that the coating

material on the bio-material is a pressure-sensitive
coating material, and that the coating material forms a

paint-like adhesive layer on the bio-material, with layer
thicknesses of less than 100 micrometres (
<
 100 µm).
Coating material as Claim 1, characterized that the coating
material has a layer thickness of under 50 µm.
Coating material as Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the
layer thickness of the coating material is less than 10 µm.
Coating material as one of the previous claims,

characterized in that
 the coating material is permanently
degraded hydrolytically and / or enzymatically and / or

through other disintegration processes. 
Coating as one of previous claims, 
characterized in that

the coating material is a bio-degradable synthetic polymer.
Coating as one of previous claims, 
characterized in that

the coating material is initially present as a solution,
dispersion or emulsion in a rapidly volatising solvent with

a high surface tension, and forms a dry, thin adhesive
layer following application to the bio-material and

subsequent drying.
Coating as one of previous claims, 
characterized in that

medicaments are incorporated into the coating material.
Coating as one of previous claims, 
characterized in that

additional medicaments inhibiting blood clotting are
incorporated into the coating material.
Coating as Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the medicaments
are components for inhibiting plasma and cellular blood

clotting.
Coating as Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 medicaments
inhibiting inflammation are incorporated into the coating

material.
Coating as Claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the
inflammation-inhibiting medicaments are corticoids.
Coating as Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 anti-biotics are
incorporated into the coating material. 
Coating as Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 vascular relaxing
medicaments are incorporated into the coating material.
Coating as one of previous claims, 
characterized in that

several layers are provided for, which may be of different
coating materials.
Coating as Claim 14, 
characterized in that
 the layer which
lasts longest in the body forms the bottom layer.
