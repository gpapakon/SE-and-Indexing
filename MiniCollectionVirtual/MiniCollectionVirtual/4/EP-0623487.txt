<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a movable container handling installation (80) with at least one elongate vehicle (71) on whose body a bridge structure (72-77) is arranged which can be extended from a transport position into an operating position parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, with a lifting mechanism which can be displaced in a direction essentially transversely to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. The bridge structure can be raised and lowered by means of hydraulically actuated telescopic supports (72) so that, in the transport position, the acceptable overall height for road or rail transport is not exceeded and, in the operating position, the necessary height for gripping and transferring the load is achieved.
