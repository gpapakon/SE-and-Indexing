<ABSTRACT>
In an ignition fuse for refrigeration (cooling) equipment operated by liquid gas, a thermoelectric switch (1) is provided, particularly for switching a thermocurrent (thermoelectric current) with respect to a gas safety valve (pressure relief valve) having an electromagnetically activated opening mechanism (2). The thermoelectric switch (1) can be controlled by an external voltage in such a way that it breaks a thermoelectric circuit in the event of the absence of the external voltage of the thermoelectric switch (1).

Thermocurrent switch, particularly for 
switching a heat flow in relation to a gas safety 

valve, with an electromagnetically activated 
opening mechanism, wherein the thermocurrent 

switch (1) can be controlled by means of an 
external voltage in such a manner that in the case 

that the external voltage is not supplied the 
thermocurrent switch (1) interrupts a 

thermocurrent circuit, characterised in that the 
thermocurrent switch comprises a casing (8, 8a) in 

which an adaptor element (11), which is preferably 
formed of brass, an electrically insulating sleeve 

(13), in which a valve contact pin (14) is 
arranged, and a securing element (18) in a semi-conductor 

assembly (15), which securing element is 
preferably made of plastics material, are 

accommodated, wherein the semi-conductor assembly 
(15) is connected to the thermocurrent circuit and 

at least one external voltage input (17). 
Thermocurrent switch according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the thermocurrent switch (1) 

comprises a casing, preferably formed of plastics 
material, which comprises two engageable casing  

 
halves (8,8a), wherein an engaging mechanism is 

preferably formed of a snap fastening (9) which is 
provided on a first casing half (8) and a 

correspondingly formed engagement catch (10) on a 
second casing half (8a). 
Thermocurrent switch according to Claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the semi-conductor 

assembly (15) comprises two contact springs (16), 
which extend substantially perpendicularly, for 

connection to the thermocurrent circuit. 
Thermocurrent switch according to any one 
of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the 

contact springs (16) are urged against the 
connections (4,14) of the thermocurrent circuit by 

means of the securing element (18). 
Thermocurrent switch according to any one 
of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the 

adaptor element (11) comprises an abutment (19) 
for the screw connection to a thermoelement (4). 
Thermocurrent switch according to any one 
of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the 

insulating sleeve (13) can be inserted in a bore 
of the adaptor element (11), and in that the 

insulating sleeve (13) is, in turn, provided for  
 

the accommodation of the valve contact pin (14). 
Safety pilot with a magnet insert, 
characterised in that it comprises a thermocurrent 

switch according to Claim 1.
