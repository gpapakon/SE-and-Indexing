<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vehicle test bench which is particularly suitable for the simulation of the driving operation of a vehicle on the street. A torque pick up (24) is connected to the rollers (10) so that the torque signal is not influenced by the bearing friction. The outer part of the torque pick up (24) is connected firmly to the roller (10) and the inner part is firmly connected to the shaft (12) of the roller (10).

Test bed for testing vehicles, which has at least one roller (10) on 
a roller shaft (12) which are rotatable together, the shaft (12) 

being disposed in a bearing (18, 20) which is carried by a frame 
(16), and in which the roller (10) comprises a roller hub (38) and a 

roller rim (36), which are connected to a connection part (42) 
therebetween, and the roller hub (38) is fastened to the roller shaft 

(12), the roller rim (36) being provided for carrying a vehicle wheel 
(22) and for a drive connection between the vehicle wheel (22) and 

the roller rim (36), and in which an electrical machine (14) is 
provided, which is connected to the roller shaft (12) and is provided 

with a control loop (34) which controls the power to be applied or 
taken up by the machine (14), 
characterized in
 that disposed between 
the roller rim (36) and a position on the shaft (12) between the 

roller rim (36) and the bearing (18, 20) is a torque pick-up (24) 
which produces a torque signal arising between the shaft (12) and the 

rim (36). 
Test bed according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the torque pick-up 
(24) comprises a torque-transmitting part (92) and a pick-up part 

(62, 74, 98), the torque-transmitting part (92) being disposed for 
transmission of the torque between the roller rim (36) and a position 

on the shaft (12) between the roller rim (36) and the bearing (18, 
20), and the pick-up part (62, 74, 98) being connected to the 

controller (34). 
Test bed according to claim 2, 
characterized in
 that the connection 
part (42) comprises the torque-transmitting part (92), while the 

torque-transmitting part (92) comprises a series of spokes (56). 
Test bed according to claim 3, 
characterized in
 that each of said 
spokes (56) is torsionally flexible in a peripheral direction while 

said spokes, upon driving of the roller (10) by a vehicle wheel (22), 
are substantially flexurally rigid in an axial and coaxial direction.  

 
Test bed according to claim 4, 
characterized in
 that the pick-up part 
comprises at least one strain gauge (62) which is provided on one of 

the spokes (56). 
Test bed according to claim 4, 
characterized in
 that the pick-up part 
(62) comprises a path sensor which detects angular displacements 

between the outer ends of the spokes (56) and the shaft (12). 
Test bed according to claim 2, 
characterized in
 that the torque-transmitting 
part (92) comprises a part (104d) of the shaft (12d) 

between the hub (38) and the bearing (18, 20). 
Test bed according to claim 7, 
characterized in
 that the pick-up part 
is a path sensor which detects the angular displacement between the 

ends of the part (104d) of the shaft (12d). 
Test bed according to claim 7, 
characterized in
 that the pick-up part 
comprises at least one strain gauge which is mounted on the part 

(104d) of the shaft (12d). 
Test bed according to claim 2, 
characterized in
 that the torque-transmitting 
part (92) is fastened between the roller hub (38) and 

the shaft (12).
