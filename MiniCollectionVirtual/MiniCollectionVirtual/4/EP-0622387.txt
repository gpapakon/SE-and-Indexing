<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to curable compositions,
especially curable coating compositions, particularly acrylic
compositions.Polyurethane compositions based on triisocyanurates for
coating and/or molding are well-known in the art. They provide a
number of desirable characteristics such as resistance to solvent,
salt, and other types of environmental attack.However, these polyurethanes do suffer some
disadvantages. An essential building block of these polyurethanes
is the triisocyanurate. Triisocyanurates are expensive and
difficult to handle. The NCO groups on the triisocyanurate are
highly reactive, so they must be chemically blocked if it is
desired to use the triisocyanurate in a one-pack coating
composition. The use of chemical blocking groups further increases
the expense of the material, results in increased VOC during cure,
introduces an additional component into the composition that can
have the potential for adverse side-effects such as yellowing, and
necessitates a high heat curing temperature on the order of 150°C.
If the NCO groups are not chemically blocked, the triisocyanurate
must be utilized as one part of a two-pack composition. With such
a composition, the highly-reactive triisocyanurate must be kept
isolated from the surrounding environment and from the other
component(s) of the composition until just before application to a
substrate or mold, further increasing the expense and complexity of
the process.It has thus long been desired to produce a composition
that exhibits the advantages of triisocyanurate-cured compositions
having an optimum mix of characteristics as described above,
especially etch resistance, but
without having to use isocyanates groups as the functional groups
for the curing reaction. EP-A-0 495 269 discloses a reactive resin mixture capable of
crosslinking on heating, which consists of polyepoxides as
crosslinkable resins and carbamates as crosslinkers, and can
be used inter alia for coatings. The problem of the resistance
of the coating to solvent, salt and other environmental
attack, especially an improved etch resistance, is neither
addressed nor solved by EP-A-0 495 269.US-Patent 4,588,783 describes coating compositions comprising
amide-containing hydroxyethyl carbamate with improved
toughness. Trifunctional carbamate compounds are not disclosed.
Again the problem of the resistance of the coating to
solvent, salt or other environmental attack is neither addressed
nor solved by US-Patent 4,588,783.In EP-A-0 152 820 carbamates having one or more further sencondary
