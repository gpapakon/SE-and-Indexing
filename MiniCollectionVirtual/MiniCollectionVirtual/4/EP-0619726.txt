<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an absorbent product, such as a sanitary napkin, a diaper, an incontinence guard or the like, comprising an absorbent body (1) enclosed between a liquid-impermeable bottom layer (3) and at least one liquid-permeable top layer (4) consisting of a net, a perforated film or a non-woven material. The purpose of the invention is to provide a product which combines the good re-wetting properties of the materials with an increased smoothness and comfort, and this has been solved by virtue of the fact that the liquid-permeable layer (4) terminates somewhat inside the longitudinal lateral edges of the product and that the longitudinal lateral edges of the top layer (4) are covered by and are fixed to a soft, skin-friendly material, e.g. a non-woven material or folded-in portions of the bottom layer (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent product,
such as a sanitary napkin, a diaper or an incontinence
guard or the like, comprising an absorbent body enclosed
between a liquid-impermeable bottom layer and at least
one liquid-permeable top layer, consisting of a net, a
perforated film or a non-woven material, which during use
of the product faces the user's body.Liquid-permeable top layers consisting of plastic nets or
perforated plastic film are previously known. The rewetting
properties of such top layers are good, and the
surface is thus felt to be dry and comfortable. One
disadvantage is, however, that the edge of the net or the
plastic film can rub sharply against the skin.The purpose of the present invention is, in a simple and
inexpensive manner, to solve the above problem and provide
a product which utilizes the good re-wetting properties
of these materials and at the same time provides
increased smoothness and comfort. This is achieved
by virtue of the fact that the
liquid-permeable top layer terminates somewhat inside the
longitudinal lateral edges of the product. Such a top sheet
terminating somewhat inside the longitudinal lateral edges of the
product is already known from SE-B-412508. According to 
the invention the longitudinal lateral edges of the
top layer are covered by and fixed to folds of a soft skin-friendly
material, e.g. a non-woven material which is
fixed to the bottom layer.
The soft skin-friendly material also extends across the
absorbent body between this body and the top layer, thus forming
together with the top layer a double upper covering layer for the
product.
The soft skin-friendly
material can consist of a less exclusive and thus cheaper
material than the material in the top layer.By virtue of the fact that the edges of the top layer are
covered, these edges will not rub against the user's
skin. According to the invention, the longitudinal
lateral edges of the top layer are covered by folds 
of a soft non-woven material, which is fixed to the
bottom layer. The edge of these folds forms the liquid
barrier against lateral leakage. These barriers can,
according to an additional variant of the invention, be
made higher with the aid of elastic threads or tapes laid
in the folds.The
soft skin-friendly material also extends across the
absorbent body inside the top layer and has portions
which extend outside the absorbent body and are joined to
the corresponding portions of the bottom layer extending
beyond the absorbent body. This provides a double surface-material,
a

<CLAIMS>
Absorbent product such as a sanitary napkin, a diaper or an incontinence guard
or the like, comprising an absorbent body (1) enclosed between a liquid-impermeable

bottom layer (3) and at least one liquid-permeable top layer (4),
consisting of a net, a perforated film or a non-woven material, which during use of

the product faces the user body and which terminates somewhat inside the
longitudinal lateral edges of the product, 
characterized
 in that the longitudinal
lateral edges of the top layer (4) are covered by and fixed to folds (5,6) of a soft,

skin-friendly material (2), e.g. a non-woven material which is fixed to the bottom
layer (3), and in that the soft skin-friendly material (2) also extends across the

absorbent body (1) between this body and the top layer (4), thus forming together
with the top layer a double upper covering layer for the product.
Product according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the top layer (4) is joined to
the soft skin-friendly material (2) not only at the lateral edges but otherwise as well.
Product according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that elastic threads
(9,10) in a stretched state are laid in the folds (5,6) and are fixed to the soft, skin-friendly

material (2), said elastic threads (9,10) in contracted state curve the
absorbent body (1) longitudinally and lift the central portions of the folds (5,6) so that

they form longitudinal liquid barriers.
