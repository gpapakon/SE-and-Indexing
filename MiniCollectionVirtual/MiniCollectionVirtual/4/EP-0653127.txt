<ABSTRACT>
Conventional Rake receivers for spread spectrum signals are typically restricted in the number of multipath components they can usefully combine. The present invention provides apparatus for combining all the useful multipath components in a received signal with modest complexity. Digital correlators are provided over the multipath delay spread of the signal at predetermined intervals and their outputs are maximal ratio combined. With close to rectangular transmission received filters, almost all the entire signal energy can be recovered at the output of the combiner even though no attempt is made to accurately align any of the correlators onto a specific multipath component.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RAKE Recei ver Combi n i ng al l the Useful Mul ti path Components of a Spread Spectrum Si gnalThe present invention relates to apparatus for use in equipment providing a digital radio link using direct sequence spread spectrum between a fixed and mobile radio unit.Equipment for providing such a radio link is described in GB Patent Application Number 9304901.3. This application describes the use of Wiener-like filters for providing good estimates of the amplitude of the inphase I, the quadrature phase Q, components of, for example, a spread spectrum pilot signal.Spread spectrum signals provide the possibility of obtaining excellent immunity to multipath fading through resolving the individual, time separated, multipath components and optimally combining them. The common approach for achieving this is to use a 'Rake' receiver as is familiar to those versed in the art. Such a receiver assigns de-spreading correlators to each of the dominant multipath components and synchronises them for maximum de-spread energy. For each of the Rake 'fingers' the phase and amplitude of the de- spread components is estimated and used to apply optimum amplitude weighting and phase alignment prior to addition (combining). The weighted sum of the multipath components will experience considerably less fading than any of the individual components so that a diversity gain is obtained. 

 One problem with the normal implementation of such a receiver is that the delay spread of the signal must be perpetually searched to determine whether a Rake finger should be assigned to a new, stronger, multipath component. If the channel is changing rapidly, significant loss in performance can result from there being too long a delay between a stronger multipath component appearing and it being assigned to a Rake finger.Additionally some channels may consist of a large number of quite small multipath components. If all or most of these are not assigned to a Rake finger then a significant amount of signal energy may be wasted for the purposes of reception although it will still appear as interference to the reception of the spread spectrum transmission sharing the carrier frequency in a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) sense. The problem with these low level components is that, unless they are being measured continuously, it is not possible to assess with adequate accuracy, when and at what level they should be included in the combining output. The requirement to allow inclusion of a large number of multipath components could lead to the
