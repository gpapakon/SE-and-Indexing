<ABSTRACT>
A chain conveyor is described having a pair of loops (40A,40B) of triple 
strand chains, frictionally driving pallets supported on upper 

advance runs, the pallets (56) linked together in subgroups to be able 
to support long length workpieces. The pallets (56) are driven around 

the chain loop sprockets (48A,48B) at either end of the conveyor (10), 
the linked 

connection allowing relative tilting of the pallets in the subgroup 
as each subgroup is driven around the sprocket axes. The pallets 

are held as they are swung around either sprocket axis by a split 
disc gripper mechanisms (70A,70B,72A,72B) which each grip a tapered 

edge gripper bar (68A,68B) 
mounted spaced below the pallet. A pair of ride bars (62A,62B) are also 

mounted below the pallet, each having a rounded shoulder at either 
end engaging a chain loop across the inside curvature of the chain 

loop when passing around the sprockets. The rounded shoulders 
nonpositively engage the chain link rollers so that the pallets are 

not positively fixed to the chain loops when swung around the 
sprocket axis at either end. An overhead form of the conveyor has 

workpiece hangers depending from each pallet during movement down 
the lower run, with workpiece suspended therefrom, the upper run 

being the return run in that embodiment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a chain conveyor
according to the generic part of the independent claim. A conveyor
of this type is described in EP-462 878 A1.Some of the prior conveyors
included an arrangement for wedging the pallets to the chains to
drive them around either curved end. In the arrangement of EP-462 878 A1
toothed discs engaged the pallets which were guided along curved
tracks. The wedging action relied on in some of those prior
conveyors could lead to wear of the chain and engaging portions of
the pallet. A disadvantage of many of the prior conveyors
is that the pallets are positively driven at the curved
ends of the conveyor. If the pallets encounter an obstruction,
damage to the pallet, the obstruction, or other conveyor components
would likely occur.Accordingly, it is the problem to be solved by the present invention 
to provide an
improved chain conveyor of the type described which does not
require a controlled stop arrangement nor involve a coordinating of
the pallet position with the rotative position of the pallet drive
discs used to swing the pallets around the sprocket axis at each
end of the conveyor.The above problem is solved by the features described in the independent
claim. Accordingly, the invention provides
a linked pallet arrangement, in which sub groups of
two or more pallets are connected together to form a combined
workpiece relatively long length supporting surface which is of
greater length than that of a single pallet while being able to be
driven around the curved ends by allowing the individual pallets in
each sub group to tip relative each other.The pallets may be linked by pairs of link bars or other
linking elements extending between linked pallets. The link bars
are able to pivot at each end to allow the pallets in each subgroup
to tip relative each other when passing around the curved conveyor
ends.The pallets are driven around the curved ends of the conveyor
by return means including at least one spring loaded split disc
gripper mechanism at each end of the conveyor. The gripper
mechanisms are driven with chain sprockets on each side of the
conveyor. The chain sprockets also drive a pair of triple link
conveyor chain loops on which the pallets rest to be frictionally
advanced along the conveyor.Each pallet has at least one tapered gripper bar mounted
beneath a workpiece supporting platform, the gripper bar aligned 
associated chain loops, so that the pallet is positioned against
the chain loops as it is gripped to be swung around by the disc
gripper mechanism
