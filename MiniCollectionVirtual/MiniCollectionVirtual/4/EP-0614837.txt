A longitudinal excavator 2 has an excavator boom 4 articulated pivotably on a carriage 12 via an articulation point 10 and having excavator means mounted movably thereon. The carriage 12 is movable on two rails 14, 16 arranged along a material store 28 for material 26 to be excavated. The delivery end of the excavator boom 4 is located above a discharge conveyor 32 arranged parallel to the rails. The rail 14 on the material side is arranged, as seen transversely to the direction of travel of the carriage 12, between the discharge conveyor 32 and a supporting wall 30 laterally limiting the material store 28.
