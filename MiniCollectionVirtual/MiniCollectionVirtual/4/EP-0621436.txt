<ABSTRACT>
A fitting for mounting an object, e.g. a 
loudspeaker, on a wall comprises two substantially 

identical saddle strip elements (2) that are laid together 
in intercrossing positions, top against top, and 

mutually fixed by means of a clamping bolt through 
longitudinally extending slots in both elements. The 

outer strip element, carrying the object to be mounted, 
may be adjusted in being displaced both in its 

directions and in the direction of the other element, 
whereby the object can be mounted with a variety of 

"directions of irradiation" from the wall and be fixed 
in a very easy and very stable manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fittings for a 
direction adjustable mounting of objects such as 
loudspeakers on a carrier surface such as a wall. 
Basically, for this purpose, it is possible to use a 
ball head fitting that will allow the object to be fixed 
in all possible directions on the ball head, not only 
with respect to the direction outwardly from the ball 
head, but also with respect to turning of the object in 
any actual plane tangential to the ball. In practice 
this type of mounting, however, is not too attractive, 
as it can be difficult to hold the object, guided in all 
directions, while arresting the fitting. Moreover, the 
ball head fittings are rather expensive to manufacture, 
if designed with a reasonably descrete appearance and a 
high total stiffness of the entire fitting. Probably in most cases it will be sufficient that 
the object to be mounted, e.g. a loudspeaker, can be 
secured with a desired direction of irradiation , i.e. 
pointing up/down and/or to one side, while it will not 
be desired that the object should also be fixable in 
different angular positions about this direction. Thus, 
the sides of a loudspeaker are preferred to be located 
in vertical planes irrespectively of the loudspeaker 
pointing upwardly or downwardly and perhaps also 
obliquely to one side or the other. On this background 
fittings have already been suggested, comprising only 
two pivot connections, for adjustment in the vertical 
and the horizontal plane, respectively. However, even 
these fittings, which comprise relatively many parts, 
are relatively expensive to manufacture with the desired 
high degree of rigidity, and the user has to tighten two 
connections, which will require some space at each of 
them, i.e. these fittings will normally appear as rather 
voluminous units between the object and the mounting 
surface.  
 In connection with the invention it has been 
realized that it is possible to provide a highly 
simplified and compact fitting, by means of which an 
object such as a loudspeaker can be mounted with a 
desired oblique direction relative to a planar support, 
but without changing its main orientation with respect 
to the vertical/horizontal disposition. According to the invention this is achievable by the features set out in claim 1. 
In particular, the fitting is made of two fitting parts, 
which may even be substantially identically shaped, 
namely as a plate strip element shaped with opposed co-planar 
end portions having mounting holes for receiving 
mounting bolts
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A fitting for direction adjustable mounting at 
an object on a carrier surface, characterized in 

comprising two rigid fitting parts each shaped as a 
saddle strip element curved in both longitudinal and transverse directions having mounting means 

at both ends, the strip elements being arrangeable in an 
intercrossing manner and fixable to each other in a 

variety of different mutual positions by clamping means 
operable a clamp the intercrossing areas together. 
A fitting according to claim 1, in which the 
clamping means is a clamping bolt extending through a 

longitudinally oriented slot in one of the elements and 
a hole in the other element. 
A fitting according to claim 2, in which the 
hole in the other element is also a longitudinally 

oriented slot. 
A fitting according to claim 3, in which the 
slots in the elements are placed at the middle thereof. 
A fitting according to claim 1, in which the 
longitudinal curvature of both of the two elements is 

either bigger or smaller than the cross sectional 
curvature thereof. 
A fitting according to claim 1, in which the two 
elements are each provided with co-planar end portions. 
A fitting according to claim 6, in which at 
least one of the elements is provided with 

keyhole-shaped holes in its planar end portions.  
 
A fitting according to claim 7, in which the 
keyholes are located with uniformly oblique directions 

relative the longitudinal and the cross direction of the 
element. 
A fitting according to claim 6, in which the 
edge areas of the stem portion of the keyholes are 

countersunk at the face opposite the mounting face so as 
to have increasing thickness towards the narrow end of 

the stem portion. 
A fitting according to claim 3, in which the 
two elements are shaped identically with respect to 

their basic shape and the slots therein.
