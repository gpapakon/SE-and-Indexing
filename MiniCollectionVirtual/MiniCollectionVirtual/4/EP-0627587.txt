<ABSTRACT>
Mount for supporting and guiding a line (C) in a curve, comprising a foot (B) which is designed for fastening on an underlying surface and is provided with a supporting-channel part extending over approximately a quarter-arc of a circle, characterized by a hollow elbow piece (A) in the form of two mutually parallel, approximately rectangular/triangular supporting walls which are connected to one another along the floating triangle side by a guide wall (5) formed in a complimentery manner on the supporting-channel part and which, furthermore, are also connected to one another along one of the rectangle sides (1) by a connecting wall (8) which at one end, in interaction with the guide wall (5), delimits a through-passage opening (3, 4) which is enclosed by a wall and is intended for the line (C), which elbow piece (A) can be fastened releasably over the foot (B), the free rectangle sides (2) of the two supporting walls projecting as far as the underlying surface.

<CLAIMS>
A mounting support for supporting and guiding a conduit (C) in 
a curve, comprising a base (B) which is designed to be fixed on a 

support and which is provided with a support channel portion (12, 13) 
extending over approximately a quarter-circle arc, characterised by a 

hollow arcuate portion (A) in the form of two mutually parallel, 
approximately right-triangular support walls which are connected 

together along the inclined side of the triangle by a guide wall (5) 
which is complementarily formed on the support channel portion (12, 

13), and which are also further connected together along one of the 
right-angled sides by a connecting wall (1a) which at one end in cooperation 

with the guide wall defines a through opening (3) for the 
conduit (C), which opening is enclosed therearound by a wall (3a), 

which arcuate portion (4) fits releasably over the base (B) and can be 
connected thereto, with the free right-angled sides of the two support 

walls projecting to the support. 
A mounting support according to claim 1 characterised in that 
provided at the other conduit passage end (4) of the guide wall (5) is 

a clamping clip which is normally open with its rotatable halves (7a, 
7b), the clip being of the type which closes automatically under the 

influence of the pressure of the bending conduit (C).
