<ABSTRACT>
A single layer film is deposited onto a substrate at room temperature from two sources, one source being a magnetic material, the other being a non-magnetic or weakly-magnetic material. The film is annealed for predetermined time in order to induce phase separation between the magnetic clusters and the non-magnetic matrix, and to form stable clusters of a size such that each magnetic particle, or cluster, comprises a single domain and has no dimensions greater than the mean free path within the particle.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GIANT MAGNETORESISTENT SINGLE FILM ALLOYSThis invention was made with Government support under Grant No. NSF-90-10908, awarded by the National Institute Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in this invention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe drive towards higher density data storage on magnetic media has imposed a significant demand on the size and sensitivity of magnetic heads. This demand has been met, in part, by thin film inductive and magnetoresistive heads which can be fabricated in very small sizes by deposition and lithographic techniques similar to those used in the semiconductor industry. Thin film inductive heads are subject to the same problems as their core-and- winding predecessors of extreme sensitivity to gap irregularities and stray fields which result in output signal losses. Thin film magnetoresistive heads, on the other hand, rely on changes in the material's resistance in response to flux from the recording media and do not require precise gap modeling. For these reasons, inter alia , magnetoresistive elements are increasingly preferred over inductive heads for reading data stored at high densities on magnetic media.A figure of merit for magnetoresistive (MR) elements is ΔR/R, which is the percent change in resistance of the element as the magnetization changes from parallel to perpendicular to the direction of the current. Current magnetoresistance elements are made from permalloy (81% Ni/19% Fe) , which, at room temperature has a ΔR/R of about 3%. For improved response, a higher value of ΔR/R is desirable.Recently, it has been found that magnetic layered structures with anti-ferromagnetic couplings exhibit giant magnetoresistahce (GMR) in which, in the presence of a magnetic field, ΔR/R can be as high as 50%. The GMR 

phenomenon is derived from the reorientation of the single domain magnetic layers. For optimum properties, the thickness of the multilayers must be less than 3 nm, and ΔR/R increases with the number of pairs of thin film layers. Thus, these multilayers provide significant challenges for production because of the precision with which the thicknesses and other features, such as interface roughness, must be maintained for the many iterations of the pairs of magnetic and non-magnetic films. Several studies have shown that MR oscillates in magnitude as a function of the thickness of the non-magnetic layers, increasing the concern about thickness control . These layered structures are also subject to output noise from magnetic domains, and, since their
