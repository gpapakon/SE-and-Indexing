<ABSTRACT>
Orthopedic casts which comprise a casting polymer of melting point Tm which is preferably from 40 to 60  DEG C. The casting polymer is preferably coated onto an elastically deformed fabric, so that the cast recovers when heated to a temperature above Tm. The cast preferably has an air flow permeability of 10 to 35 % resulting from the presence of apertures of area 0.01 to 0.08 cm
<

>
, so that it can be rapidly heated by means of a hot air gun. Preferred casting polymers comprise a side chain crystallizable (SCC) polymer, particularly one containing units derived from styrene or another high Tg monomer. The addition of certain other polymers, e.g. an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer, and/or certain inorganic fillers, e.g. calcium carbonate, wollastonite and talc, results in improved balance of tensile strength and elongation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to orthopedic casts.It is well known to make orthopedic casts, splints, supports, braces, shields,
wound covers, and like orthopedic devices (all of which are referred to herein simply as
"casts") from calcined gypsum (Plaster of Paris) or from a polymer which is formed into
shape while hot and hardens on cooling. The term "casting composition" is used herein
to denote a polymeric composition which can be formed into shape while hot and
hardens on cooling. The casting composition can comprise a single polymer or a
mixture of two or more polymers, and can contain additional ingredients such as
inorganic fillers. The known casts can contain a flexible support, which may be elastic,
for example a fabric or a foam sheet. Reference should be made for example to US
Patent Nos. 3,692,023 (Phillips), 3,728,206 (Buese), 3,809,600 (Larson), 4,231,356
(Usukura), 4,404,333 (Watanabe), 4,473,672 (Green), 4,668,563 (Buese), 4,784,123
(Robeson), 4,912,174 (Grouiller), and 4,946,726 (Sandvig), British Patent No,
1,522,399 (Hexcel) and European patent publication 0,110,860 (Luxilon). However,
the known casts do not provide an entirely satisfactory combination of moldability at
temperatures which are well tolerated by the recipient of the cast, rapid hardening, and,
after hardening, adequate strength, light weight, good breathability, water resistance,
and transparency to x-rays.We have discovered a number of important improvements in casting
compositions and in the construction, application and use of orthopedic casts, especially
on human patients, but also on animals. These discoveries can also be utilized in
equivalent and related fields, where the same or similar casts are applied to inanimate
substrates and where the casting compositions are used for molding generally.In a first aspect, the present invention provides a heat-recoverable cast which
comprises
(1) a recoverable fabric support which is in a stretched condition; and(2) a rigid casting composition which
(a) maintains the support in its stretched condition, and(b) comprises a casting polymer having a crystalline melting point
Tm; 
whereby the cast
(A) at temperatures below Tm, has a first stable configuration,(B) when heated to a temperature above Tm in the absence of restraint,
becomes moldable and recovers so that at least one dimension thereof
decreases from a first value x to a second value y which is at most 0.95
x, and(C) when cooled to a temperature below Tm after being molded, adopts a
second, stable configuration.In a second
