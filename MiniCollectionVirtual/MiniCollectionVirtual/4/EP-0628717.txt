<ABSTRACT>
- The invention relates to a device for vaporising fuel in an inlet port (2) emerging into a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine comprising a heating element (7) mounted downstream of the fuel injector (4) and onto which the fuel is sprayed. - According to the invention, the heating element (7) may consist of several conducting surfaces, all substantially parallel to the general direction of flow of the fluid in the inlet port (2).

A device for vaporising fuel in an intake pipe
(2) opening into a combustion chamber of an internal

combustion engine consisting of a heating element (7) of
a shape such that a diameter can be defined and being

mounted downstream of the fuel injector (4), the fuel
being projected onto the heating element (7),

characterised in that the heating element (7) is made up
of several conductive surfaces, all substantially

parallel with the general direction of the fluid flow
through the intake pipe (2), in that the heating element

(7) occupies between 6 and 7% of the total transverse
surface of the intake pipe (2) where it limits pressure

losses and in that the length of the heating element
measured in the direction of flow is approximately half

the diameter of the heating element (7) measured in a
plane perpendicular to the direction of flow.
A device for vaporising fuel as claimed in
claim 1, characterised in that it also has a control

element designed to activate the heating element if the
temperature in the intake pipe (2) is lower than a first

value and cut off the power supply to the heating element
if the temperature in said pipe (2) is greater than a

second value higher than the first.
A device as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the distance between two

adjacent parallel surfaces is not less than 1 mm.
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the heating element (7) is

operated by joule effect.
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the heating element (7) is

operated by conduction.
A vaporising device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the heating element (7) is made up

of a strip wound in a spiral, the axis of which is
parallel with the direction of fluid flow through the

intake pipe (2).
A vaporising device as claimed in one of claims
1 to 7, characterised in that the heating element (7) is

made up of a set of flat plates.
A vaporising device as claimed in claim 7,
characterised in that said plates are parallel with one

another.
A vaporising device as claimed in claim 7,
characterised in that said plates are perpendicular to

one another.
