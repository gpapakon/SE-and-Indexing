<ABSTRACT>
Shielding devices of this type are difficult to handle in the case of multiple assembly and disassembly. To remove this disadvantage, the shielding device has a flange (6) which is fastened to the vessel and leaves the opening cross-section of the vessel (1) free. The flange carries a rod (9) projecting parallel to the axis of the opening. Between the rod and the shielding body (4) there is arranged a connecting piece (11), by means of which the shielding body can be moved with its axis parallel to the rod or in a curve shape around the rod.

Shielding device whose shielding body (4) can be 
introduced into an opening (2) in a vessel (1) of a 

nuclear installation, characterized in that the shielding 
device has a flange (6) which is attached to the vessel 

(1) and leaves the opening cross-section of the vessel 
free, in that the flange bears a rod (9) which projects 

parallel to the axis (10) of the opening (2), in that a 
connection piece (11) is arranged between the rod and the 

shielding body, and in that the shielding body can be 
moved axially parallel to or in an arcuate manner around 

the rod. 
Shielding device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the rod (9) is provided with at least one 

guide groove (18) starting from its side facing the 
flange (6), which groove is designed in a helical manner 

at its end remote from the flange (6), and in that a 
region of the connection piece (11) engaging over the rod 

has a guide piece (19) which can be moved along the guide 
groove (18). 
Shielding device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the shielding body (4) is fitted on 

the circumferential side with ball rollers (24) which 
serve for guidance along the opening (2). 
Shielding device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the connection piece (11) is 

releasably connected to the vessel (1) by means of a 
dovetail guide extending parallel to the rod axis, the 

said dovetail guide being retainable in a predeterminable 
position.  

 
Shielding device according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the flange (6) is assigned a 

fixing device (31) which acts in relation to the shielding 
body (4). 
Shielding device according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the connection piece (11) has a 

fixing screw (27) which can be placed against the rod 
(9). 
Shielding device according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the shielding body (4) is 

assigned inlet (22) and outlet openings (23) for 
deionized water. 
Shielding device according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that supply, disposal and venting 

lines pass through the shielding body (4). 
Shielding device according to one of Claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that a lug (32) is attached to the 

flange (6), which lug bears a holding element (33) 
connected to the rod (9).
