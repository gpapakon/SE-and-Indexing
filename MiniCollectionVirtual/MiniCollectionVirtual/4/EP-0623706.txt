<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a switchgear (points) for overhead conveyors, comprising at least one so-called mobile rail section, which is intended to connect the ends of at least two stationary rails together mechanically. It is characterised in that the free end of the mobile section is supported substantially over its entire travel by a suspension element (25) connecting the said free end to at least one support point (26) which, located above the plane defined by the travel of the said mobile section in question, is substantially on the axis (24) of the articulation means of the mobile section, so as to form a triangulation.

<CLAIMS>
A switching device for suspended conveyors, comprising two rail sections (5, 6), referred
to as movable, intended to mechanically link together the ends of at least two fixed rails

(2, 7, 8), such as the ends of a main rail (2) and of two secondary rails (7, 8), which
movable section (5, 6) has:


on the one hand, one (5a, 6a) of its ends (5a, 5b, 6a, 6b) associated with one of the fixed
rails by an articulation (9, 10) and,
on the other hand, its other end (5b, 6b), referred to as free, able to assume two specific
positions, the one referred to as passage position in which this free end is opposite the

end face of a fixed rail so as to ensure continuity between two fixed rails, and the other
referred to as stand-by position in which this free end is located at a distance from the

above-mentioned end face,

this device being characterised in that the free end (5b, 6b) of at least one movable
section is supported over substantially its entire path by a suspension element (25)

connecting the said free end (5b, 6b) to at least one supporting point (26) which, located
above the plane defined by the path of the said movable section under consideration, is

substantially on the axis (24) of the articulation means (9, 10) of the movable section so
as to define a triangle.
A device in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the suspension element is of
fixed length.
A device in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the suspension element is of
the type whose length can vary according to the path of the end of the movable section,

and its variation is controlled as a function of the position of the movable section along
the path.
A device in accordance with Claim 1 to 3, characterised in that at least one of the ends of
the suspension element is associated by an articulation means (27) with one of the parts

constituting the supporting point and the movable section.
A device in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that the articulation means of the
suspension element can be of the type having several degrees of freedom. 
A device in accordance with Claim 4 or 5, characterised in that one (28) of the axes of
the articulation means connecting the supporting point (26) and the suspension element

(25) is collinear with the axis (24) of the articulation means of the movable section
associating the latter with the fixed part of the structure supporting it.
A device in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that, in relation to a substantially
horizontal plane, the articulation means (27) of the suspension element (25) and the

articulation means (9, 10) of the movable section are located on either side of the
structure portion supporting the said movable section.
