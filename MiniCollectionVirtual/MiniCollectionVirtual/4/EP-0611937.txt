<ABSTRACT>
A mixer-dryer has a basically cylindrical housing (1) in which a mixing unit (14) is arranged which can be driven in rotation. The housing (1) has at one end a material feed nozzle (18) and, at the other end, a material outlet nozzle (19) and is provided in its bottom region (33) with at least one drying-gas feed chamber (34, 35) which extends over an essential part of the length of the housing (1) and is connected to the interior (17) of the housing (1) via a gas-permeable bottom (36, 37). In the region of its top side, the housing (1) has a gas extractor which is designed as a filter box (44) which extends over an essential part of the length of the housing (1) and in which a plurality of filters (45) are arranged one after the other over the length of the housing (1), which filters are connected to a drying-gas extractor (47).

A mixer drier comprising a stationary, fundamentally cylindrical housing
(1), in which a mixing unit (14) continuously drivable in rotation about its

central longitudinal axis is disposed, which at one end referred to the central
longitudinal axis, is provided with a material supply connector (18) and

at the opposite end seen in the conveying direction and referred to the central
longitudinal axis, with a material outlet connector (19), which, in its

interior space (17), possesses a bed of material (26) to be dried and, in its
bottom area (33), is provided with at least one drying gas supply chamber

(34, 35) which extends over a substantial part of the length of the housing
(1) and is joined to a drying gas supply (39, 40) and connected with the

interior space (17) of the housing (1) by way of a gas-permeable bottom
(36, 37), and which, in the vicinity of its top side (42) is provided with a

gas outlet, 
characterized in that
 the gas outlet is an approximately cuboidal
filter box (44) which extends at least over a substantial part of the length of

the housing (1) in the direction of the central longitudinal axis and is connected
with the latter's interior space (17) and in which several filters (45)

are disposed one after the other over the length of the housing (1), the filters
(45) being connected with a drying gas outlet (47).
A mixer drier according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the filters (45)
are oblong and disposed approximately vertically and crosswise to the central

longitudinal axis (2) of the mixing unit (14).
A mixer drier according to one of the claims 1 to 2, 
characterized in that

it is a pusher or a shaker mixer. 
A mixer drier according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that

several drying gas supply chambers (34, 35) are provided one after the
other in the conveying direction (24).
A mixer drier according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the
at least one drying gas supply chamber (34, 35) is connected with the interior

space (17) of the housing (1) by way of a bottom (36, 37) in the form
of a perforated bottom.
A mixer drier according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 at
least one deagglomeration device (49) is provided.
A mixer drier according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the
gas-permeable bottom in the form of at least one perforated bottom (36, 37)

extends over 40° to 90°.
