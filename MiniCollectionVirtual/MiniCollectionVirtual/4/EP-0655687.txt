<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor memory device has a plurality of 
memory cell sub-arrays (22a-22d) selectively used as a data 

storage for prohibiting a defective memory cell sub-array 
from a data access, and a shifting circuit (26) couples the 

available memory cell sub-arrays to input and output data 
buffer circuits higher in a priority than another input and 

output data buffer circuit regardless of the location of 
the defective memory cell sub-array in the plurality of 

memory cell sub-arrays so as to share a printed circuit 
board between the semiconductor memory devices having the 

partially available memory cell sub-arrays.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor memory
device and, more particularly, to a semiconductor memory
device having a shifting circuit connected between data bus
lines and input/output data buffer circuits for steering
data bits from the input/output data buffer circuit to
available memory cell sub-arrays.A typical example of the semiconductor memory device
is illustrated in figure 1 of the drawings, and the prior
art semiconductor memory device comprises a regular memory
cell array 1 accompanied by a row of redundant memory
cells 1a and columns of redundant memory cells 1b. If a
row of regular memory cells contains a defective memory
cell, the defective row of regular memory cells is replaced
with the row of redundant memory cells. On the other hand,
if a defective memory cell is found in a column of regular
memory cells, the defective column of regular memory cells
and associated columns of regular memory cells are replaced
with the columns of redundant memory cells. The prior art semiconductor memory device further
comprises regular word lines WL0 to WLm shared between the
regular memory cell array 1 and the columns of redundant
memory cells 1b, a redundant word line RWL for replacing a
row of regular memory cells with the row of redundant
memory cells, a row address decoder/word line driver unit
2a coupled to the regular word lines WL0 to WLm and a
redundant word line driver unit 2b coupled to the redundant
word line RWL instead of the regular word lines WL0 to WLm.When row address predecoded signals ADR are supplied
to the row address decoder/ word line driver unit 2a, the
row address decoder/word line driver unit activates one of
the regular word lines WL0 to WLm insofar as the row
address predecoded signals does not indicate a row address
assigned to the defective row of regular memory cells.On the other hand, if the row address predecoded
signals are indicative of the row address of the defective
row of regular memory cells, the row address decoder/word
line driver unit 2a maintains the regular word lines WL0 to
WLm in inactive level, and the redundant word line driver
unit 2b activates the redundant word line RWL. Therefore,
the regular word lines WL0 to WLm and the row address
decoder/word line driver unit 2a make a row of the regular 
memory cells and one of the redundant memory cells 1b
accessible.The prior art semiconductor memory device further
comprises regular bit line pair groups BL0 to BLn shared
between the regular memory cell array 1 and the redundant
memory cells 1a, a redundant
