<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are strength loss resistant methods for treating cotton toweling with cellulase so as to impart permanent softening to the toweling. In particular, the methods disclosed herein involve the application of a specified amount of cellulase onto one or both of the surfaces of a cotton toweling so as to result in permanent softening of the toweling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to strength loss 
resistant methods for treating cotton toweling and 
related fabrics with cellulase so as to impart 
permanent softening to these fabrics. In particular, 
the methods of the present invention involve the 
application of a specified amount of cellulase onto the 
surface fibers of cotton toweling and related fabrics 
so as to result in permanent softening of such fabrics. 
On the other hand, since a specified amount of 
cellulase is applied only onto the surface fibers of 
such fabrics, the base fibers (i.e., the interior 
fibers) of the fabric are not exposed to significant 
quantities of cellulase. In turn, the interior fibers 
are not significantly degraded by cellulase and 
accordingly, strength loss in the treated fabric is 
reduced as compared to the strength loss arising from 
treating all of the fibers of the fabric with 
cellulase. The methods of the present invention are 
particularly suitable for use in both a continuous and 
batch process for treating cotton toweling and related 
fabrics with cellulase.  
 The use of cellulase to impart permanent softening 
properties to cotton toweling and related materials is 
well known in the art. For example, cotton toweling 
can be treated in a batch or continuous process whereby 
the treated fabric is washed (immersed) in a cellulase 
solution at specified conditions. Under such 
conditions, both the interior and the surface cotton 
fibers of the fabric are exposed to the cellulase 
solution. After treatment, the fabric is generally 
rinsed and dried. Under these conditions, such 
treatment with cellulase results in permanent softening 
for the fabric. However, there is a problem with the treatment of 
cotton toweling and related fabrics in the manner of 
the prior art. Specifically, when treated in 
heretofore known methods for imparting permanent 
softening, such fabrics experience undesirable weight 
loss, reduced tensile strength and reduced absorbency. 
These detrimental attributes can be so severe as to 
render the treated fabric a poorer quality product as 
compared to the fabric prior to treatment. In view of the above, methods for treating cotton 
toweling and related fabrics which impart permanent 
softening properties to such fabrics but which also 
result in reductions in the undesirable properties 
imparted by prior art processes would be particularly 
advantageous. The present invention is directed to new methods 
for treating cotton toweling and related fabrics with 
cellulase so as to

<CLAIMS>
A method for imparting a permanent softening property 
to cotton toweling by treatment with cellulase which method 

comprises: 

(a) applying onto the surfaces of said toweling an 
aqueous cellulase solution containing at least 0.2 

grams per liter cellulase wherein the weight amount of said 
aqueous cellulase solution applied onto the surface(s) of 

said toweling is between 10 to 50 percent of the 
weight of said toweling; and 
(b) maintaining the toweling under conditions 
sufficient to impart softening to said toweling, the 

conditions including a temperature between 20°C and 
65°C and for a period of time from 1 to 

16 hours. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the 
application of said aqueous cellulase solution to said 

toweling is by spraying. 
The method according to claim 2 wherein the spraying 
of the aqueous cellulase solution is over both surfaces of 

the toweling. 
The method according to claim 3 wherein both surfaces 
of said toweling are sprayed simultaneously. 
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
further comprising the step of treating the cotton toweling 

to remove and/or inactivate the cellulase enzyme. 
The method according to claim 5 wherein said cellulase 
enzyme is removed by washing the toweling with a cellulase 

free aqueous solution. 
The method according to claim 6 wherein after removal  
 

of said enzyme, the toweling is dried at a temperature 
sufficiently high to both dry the toweling and to 

inactivate any remaining cellulase enzyme. 
The method according to claim 5 wherein said cellulase 
enzyme is inactivated by heating the toweling at a 

temperature and time sufficient to inactivate said enzyme. 
The method according to claim 8 wherein said cellulase 
enzyme is inactivated by heating the cellulase containing 

cotton toweling to a temperature of at least 75°C for at 
least 10 minutes. 
The method according to claim 8 wherein after 
inactivation of said enzyme, the toweling is washed with a 

cellulase free aqueous solution and then dried. 
The method according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein said aqueous cellulase solution additionally 

contains from 0.1 to 5 weight percent of a 
surfactant based on the total weight of the aqueous 

cellulase solution. 
The method according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein said aqueous cellulase solution additionally 

contains a compatible buffer at a concentration of at least 
0.005 N. 
The method according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein said cellulase enzyme is derived from a 

fungal microorganism. 
Cotton toweling treated by the method of any one of 
claims 1 to 13.
