<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to secondary 
batteries, and more particularly, to an improvement of the 
performance of a lithium battery with a negative electrode 
containing graphite particles which can cause 
intercalation and de-intercalation of lithium ions. As miniaturization and power saving have proceeded in 
the field of electronics, secondary batteries using alkali 
metals such as lithium have attracted attention. A 
battery using alkali metal alone such as lithium for a 
negative electrode is encountered with a problem of short 
circuit in the battery by repetition of charge/discharge. 
More specifically, repetition of charge/discharge repeats 
dissolution and precipitation of the alkali metal, and a 
dendrite of the alkali metal grows on the surface of the 
negative electrode. The dendrite grows penetrating 
through the separator between the negative electrode and 
the positive electrode, and comes into contact with the 
positive electrode to form a short circuit. Use of an alkali metal alloy for the negative 
electrode of a secondary battery instead of an alkali  
 
metal decreases such growth of dendrite and improves 
charge/discharge cycle characteristic. Use of an alkali 
metal alloy for the negative electrode however cannot 
completely prevent the growth of dendrite and there is 
still a possibility of short circuit in the battery. In recent years, a negative electrode of carbon or a 
conductive organic polymer material has been developed 
taking advantage of insertion and desertion of alkali 
metal ions rather than metal dissolution, deposition, 
diffusion in solid or the like as practiced in the case of 
an alkali metal or an alloy thereof. In such a negative 
electrode of carbon or a conductive polymer material, 
dendrites which have been grown in the case of the 
negative electrode of an alkali metal or an alloy thereof 
are prevented and the problem of short circuit in the 
battery has been solved. Carbon which is a chemically stable substance and can 
be doped with either an electron-donor element or an 
electron-acceptor element is a preferable material for an 
electrode for a battery. When carbon is used for an active material for a 
negative electrode, lithium can be intercalated between 
layers of carbon in 1 lithium atom per 6 carbon atoms at 
maximum, in other words at most LiC6. At the upper limit, 
theoretical capacity only by a reaction between carbon and  
 
lithium is 372mAh/g (unit weight of carbon). Carbon can take various forms from amorphous carbon 
to
