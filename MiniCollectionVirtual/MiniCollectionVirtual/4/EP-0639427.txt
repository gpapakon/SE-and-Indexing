<ABSTRACT>
Shielding gas is continuously introduced adjacent to the electrode at the weld site, said gas being present at a concn. of 20-5000 vpm, pref. 50-3000 vpm (0.005-0.30 vol.%) and contg. principally Ar and/or He, plus heavy noble gases (e.g. Kr, Xe) and/or table, elementary diatomic or triatomic gases (e.g. H2, O2, CO2, CO, N2O and NO2) and/or gaseous, stable inorganic cpds., pref. C1-C4 hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H4) having ionisation energies of 8-17 eV, pref. 8-14.3 eV.

Gas-shielded-arc welding process in which a 
shielding-gas flow is continuously fed to the welding 

point, adjacent to the electrode, during the welding 
operation, the shielding gas being composed of substantial 

portions of argon or a mixture of argon and helium 
and also having an admixture of merely 50 to 1000 vpm 

(0.005 to 0.10 % by volume) of carbon dioxide and/or 
oxygen, characterized in that the shielding gas contains 

hydrogen in a range of 0.5 to 4 % by volume. 
Gas-shielded-arc welding process according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the shielding gas contains 

at least 40 % by volume of argon and 10 to 55 % by volume 
of helium. 
Gas-shielded-arc welding process according to 
Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the shielding gas is 

composed of 46.9 to 76.9 % by volume of argon, 20 to 50 % 
by volume of helium, 1 to 3 % by volume of hydrogen and 

also an admixture of 150 to 800 vpm of carbon dioxide 
and/or oxygen. 
Gas-shielded-arc welding process according to one 
of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the shielding gas 

is prepared as a mixture ready for use. 
Gas-shielded-arc welding process according to one 
of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the shielding gas 

is mixed from the relevant components at the place of use 
and while using a premix stage. 
Shielding gas for arc welding the most varied 
materials, but in particular for welding higher-alloy, 

corrosion-resistant steels, nickel and aluminium  
 

materials, the shielding gas being composed of substantial 
portions of argon or a mixture of argon and helium 

and having an admixture of 50 to 1000 vpm (0.005 to 
0.10 % by volume) of carbon dioxide and/or oxygen, 

characterized in that the shielding gas contains hydrogen 
in a range of 0.5 to 4 % by volume. 
Shielding gas for arc welding according to Claim 
6, characterized in that the shielding gas contains at 

least 40 % by volume of argon and 10 to 55 % by volume of 
helium. 
Shielding gas for arc welding according to Claim 
6 or 7, characterized in that the shielding gas is 

composed of 46.9 to 76.9 % by volume of argon, 20 to 50 % 
by volume of helium, 1 to 3 % by volume of hydrogen and 

also of 150 to 800 vpm of carbon dioxide and/or oxygen. 
Use of the process according to Claims 1 to 5 and 
of the shielding gases according to Claims 6 to 8 when 

welding in a constrained position, in particular in a 
horizontal-vertical position.
