<ABSTRACT>
The ignition key removal blocking device for ignition switches of motor vehices with automatic or manual transmission operates in a manner dependent on whether the transmission is in a "park" or "interlock" position in which the driven wheels of the vehicle are locked. Assigned to the ignition switch (2) or to a shaft (2a) which transmits the turning of the key to the ignition switch is an electromagnetic or electromechanical blocking device (3) which is connected to a switching contact (4) on the transmission and has a blocking extension (5) which interacts with a blocking step (6) on the ignition switch (2) or on the shaft (2a) and blocks the rotation of the ignition key into the withdrawal position depending on the position of the transmission. The blocking device (3) preferably consists of an electromagnet (7) with a spring-loaded armature (8) which, at its free end, carries the blocking extension (5) and, in the "ignition key locked" position, extends from outside with the said blocking extension into the path of motion of a rotor (9) with the blocking step (6) on the ignition switch (2) or on the shaft.

Withdrawal lockout for the ignition key in ignition 
switches of motor vehicles with automatic or shift 

transmission in dependence upon the transmission being in 
a "park" or "locking" position which locks the driving 

wheels of the vehicle, an electromagnetic or 
electromechanical locking device connected to a switching 

contact at the transmission cooperating with a locking 
step (6) and preventing rotation of the ignition switch 

(2) into the withdrawal position of the ignition key in 
dependence upon the position of the transmission, 


characterized in that
 the locking step 
(6) is formed on the rotor (9) of the ignition switch 

(2), and that the locking device (3) at the ignition 
switch (2) comprises an electromagnet (7) having a 

spring-loaded armature (8) or plunger core, which in the 
"ignition key locked" position engages with a locking 

extension (5) at its free end from the outside into the 
path of motion of the rotor (9) having the locking step 

(6). 
Withdrawal lockout according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the ignition switch (2) receiving the locking device 

(3) is wired up in such a way that the locking device may 
easily be subsequently added on or installed, the 

ignition switch (2) as such being capable of functioning 
with or without a withdrawal lockout. 
Withdrawal lockout according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the locking device (3) takes the 

form of a clapper-type relay or plunger core relay. 
Withdrawal lockout according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the locking extension (5) is 

supported by a lateral stop (10) in the OFF switching 
direction of the ignition switch (2).  

 
Withdrawal lockout according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the locking device (3) is wired up 

in such a way that the exciter circuit of the 
electromagnet (7) is interrupted in the "park" or 

"locking" position, which locks the driving wheels of the 
vehicle, and is closed in the operating positions of the 

transmission. 
Withdrawal lockout according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the locking device (3) is wired up 

in such a way that the exciter circuit of the 
electromagnet (7) is closed in the "park" or "locking" 

position, which locks the driving wheels of the vehicle, 
and is interrupted in the operating positions of the 

transmission. 
Withdrawal lockout according to one of claims 1 to 5 or 
6, characterized in that the locking device (3) locks at 

least when the ignition key is moved out of the "drive" 
position into the "key withdrawable" position and at the 

same time the transmission is not locking the driving 
wheels.
