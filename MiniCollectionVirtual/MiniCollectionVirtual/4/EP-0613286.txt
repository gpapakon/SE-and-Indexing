<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention relates to enhancement of 
the convenience of a communication apparatus (1) utilizing a 

public line (3). A facsimile apparatus (1) and a telephone 
set (2) are connected to a one telephone line (3) in 

parallel with each other. A voltage variation Î”V due to 
closing/opening of a DC circuit of the telephone set (2) is 

detected via a hook detector (6) of the facsimile apparatus 
(1) and the operation mode of the telephone set (2) is 

detected in response to an output from the hook detector 
(6). The detected operation mode of the telephone set (2) 

is stored in a RAM (14) and outputted by a printer (9) or on 
a display screen (10). A display is outputted in accordance 

with the closing/opening of the DC circuit of the telephone 
set (2) on the display screen (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication apparatus
comprising a telephone set connected to a single public telephone
line and a facsimile machine connected to said single
public telephone line. A communication apparatus of this kind
is known from US-A-4,432,020.Fig. 14 is a circuit diagram showing a line interface unit
(LIU) circuit 41 of a conventional facsimile apparatus. The
LIU circuit 41 is connected to a telephone line 43 via connection
jacks 48a, 48b. A telephone set 42 is connected to the
telephone line 43 in parallel with the facsimile apparatus.
Further, the LIU circuit 41 is connected to an external telephone
51 via connection jacks 50a, 50b.A transformer 44 is connected to a change-over switch 45 which
changes the connection of the telephone line 43 to a modem
side of the facsimile apparatus or to the external telephone
51 side. A hook detector 46 is connected between the
change-over switch 45 and the connection jack 48a and an 
arrester 47 is connected among the connection jacks 48a, 48b
and the change-over switch 45 in parallel with the change-over
switch 45 in order to protect a facsimile apparatus by
absorbing a surge voltage which might be generated on the
telephone line 43. The hook detector 46 comprises a
photocoupler PC2, a resistor R13, a capacitor C12, a varistor
VA1, and a resistor R14 being connected between the
transformer 44 and the resistor R13 in series. the photocoupler
PC2 comprises a phototransistor and a light emitting
diode which are connected in parallel with each other and
arranged in a direction contrary to each other, and
electrical continuity of the phototransistor is obtained by
emission of the light emitting diode caused by an input
signal. In addition, a resistor R15 is connected between the
transformer 44 and the change-over switch 45. The resistors
R13, R14, R15, the capacitor C12, and the varistor VA1
regulate frequency characteristics and signal levels from the
facsimile apparatus. A hook detector 49 is connected between
the change-over switch 45 and a connection jack 50b. The
hook detector 49 comprises a capacitor C11, a resistor R11,
a photocoupler PC1 which are connected in parallel with
each other, and a resistor R12 being connected between
the resistor R11 and the photocoupler PC1in series.
The working operation of the photocoupler PC1 in series.
The working operation of the photocoupler PC1 is the same
as that of the photocoupler PC2, and the capacitor
C11 and the resistors R11, R21 regulate frequency 
characteristics and signal levels from the
