<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microencapsulated oil or fat 
product containing at least one highly unsaturated fatty acid or a 
derivative thereof, a process of preparing the microcapsules and the 
use of the microencapsulated product in an infant formula and other 
functional foods. Fat and oil products containing significant amounts of highly 
unsaturated fatty acids have recently been shown to possess valuable 
nutritional properties. Thus, US patent No. 4,670,285 describes an 
aqueous infant formula and an edible fat product for incorporation 
into an infant formula comprising highly unsaturated C20 or C22, ω-6 
fatty acids and C20 or C22, ω-3 fatty acids which are considered to 
be of vital importance for the synthesis of structural lipids in the 
human brain. It also appears from said US 4 670 285 that infants and 
especially premature infants are unable to synthesize such unsaturated 
fatty acids in sufficient quantities. EP-B1-231904 discloses a method for preparation of a fat mixture for 
infant feeds containing arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid in a 
ratio of 2:1 to 3:1. According to the method various vegetable and 
animal fats or oils are heated, blended to obtain the desired fatty 
acid composition and stabilised by the addition of ascorbylic 
palmitate or alpha-tocopherol. The fat mixture can be used in the 
preparation of liquid or pulverized infant formulas. Lipids containing unsaturated fatty acids, such as C20:4 and C22:4, 
ω-6, C20:5, ω-3 and C22:3, ω-3, degrade easily under production of 
unpleasant tasting aldehydes (Pokorny, J. (1976) Effect of Non-lipidic 
Substances on Rancid Off Flavour of Lipids in Paoletti, R. 
et al. (eds.) Lipids, Vol. 2: Technology, p. 475-481, Raven Press, 
New York, 1976). Thus, it is necessary to protect such lipids in e.g. food products 
from oxygen, trace metals and other substances which attack the 
double bonds of the highly unsaturated fatty acids in order to avoid 
off-flavour and loss of physiological activity and to increase the 
shelf life of products containing them. More specifically, there is  
 
a need to provide microencapsulated fats or oils, such as vegetable 
and marine oils, wherein the highly unsaturated fatty acids are 
present in a digestible, shelf stable and undegradable form, 
preferably in a free flowing powdered form to be readily mixed with 
other dry or liquid components to form a nutritionally satisfying 
product, such as an infant formula, without the use of undesired 
additives. GB-A-2,240,702 discloses a process
