<DESCRIPTION>
 HUMAN INTERLEUKIN-13The present invention relates to compositions and methods for affecting the human immune system. In particular, it provides nucleic acids, proteins, and antibodies which regulate immune system response and development. Diagnostic and therapeutic uses of these materials are also disclosed.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFor some time, it has been known that the mammalian immune response is based on a series of complex cellular interactions, called the "immune network." Recent research has provided new insights into the inner workings of this network. While it remains clear that much of the response involves network-like interactions of lymphocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and other cells, immunologists now generally hold the opinion that soluble proteins, known as lymphokines, cytokines, or monokines, play a critical role in controlling these cellular interactions.In view of their importance, there is a need to identify and isolate new lymphokines.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention fills this need by providing one such new lymphokine. More particularly, this invention provides human interleukin-13 (IL-13), and methods for its use. This invention also provides nucleic acids coding for polypeptides themselves and methods for their production and use. The nucleic acids of the invention are characterized by their homology to cloned complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences enclosed herein, and/or by functional assays for IL-13 activity applied to the polypeptides, which are typically encoded by these nucleic acids. 

Methods for modulating or intervening in the control of an immune response are provided.The invention is based, in part, on the discovery and cloning of human cDNAs which are capable of expressing proteins having IL-13 activity. cDNA clones include human cDNA inserts of plasmid vectors pB21.2Bf and pA10.66, which contain partial and full length sequences, respectively. Equivalent vectors may be constructed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques and the sequences of the inserts. The present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid comprising a segment homologous to a sequence of human IL-13 disclosed in Table 1. Typically, the segment is at least about 50 nucleotides, and will often encode a protein exhibiting a biological activity characteristic of a human IL-13, e.g., an amino acid sequence of Table 1. In other embodiments, the segment is at least 80% homologous to the coding sequence disclosed in Table 1. In other embodiments, the nucleic acid will
