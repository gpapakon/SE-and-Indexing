<ABSTRACT>
Valve (27) for use with an introducer assembly (11) with a valve housing (19) for receiving the valve (27) to permit a medical instrument to be introduced therethrough. The valve (27) consisting of an elastic body (61) with a cylindrical wall (62) having an axially-extending bore (63). The body (61) is provided with a first planar wall (71) integral with one end of the cylindrical wall (62) and second wall (76) integral with the other end of the cylindrical wall (62). The first wall (71) has an opening (73) aligned with the bore (63) and a slit (81) in the second wall (76) extending diametrically of the bore (63) to provide first and second leaflets (82 and 83). The valve (27) permits a medical instrument to be introduced therethrough providing a seal between the valve (27) and the medical instrument. The second wall (76) has inner and outer surfaces (77 and 78) which are inclined outwardly from a plane extending perpendicular to the axis of the bore (63) to avoid prolapse of the leaflets (82 and 83) during removal of the instrument from the valve (27).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an introducer assembly and valve
construction for use therein.An introducer assembly is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
5,176,648 and a valve in U.S. Patent No. 5,141,498 for use
in the introducer assembly. A hemostasis valve having support
shoulders is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,092,857, issued
March 3, 1992. In the background of the invention, this
patent discusses a variety of devices designed to solve the
problem of various sizes of catheters introduced as part of
a surgical procedure and the attempts to seal against the back
pressure of blood in such cannula units. In using such a
valve in the introducer assembly it has been found in certain
instances that an electrocautery hook catches onto one or more
of the leaflets of the valve as the hook is being withdrawn
causing the valve to prolapse to and not maintain a good seal.
There is, therefore, a need for a new and improved introducer
assembly and a valve construction for use therein which will
overcome this difficulty.In general, it is an object of the present invention to
provide an introducer assembly and a valve construction for
use therein which can be utilized in various laparoscopic
procedures in which hooks are utilized.Another object of the present invention is to provide an
introducer assembly for which good seals are maintained during
introduction and withdrawal of laparoscopic instruments.Another object of the present invention is to provide an
introducer assembly and valve construction for use therein
in which the valve construction resists prolapse.Additional objects of the present invention will appear
from the defined description in which preferred embodiments
are set forth in detail in conjunction with the accompanying
drawings. FIG. 1 is an elevational view partially in cross-section
showing the introducer assembly with a valve construction for
use therein incorporating the present invention.FIG. 2 is an enlarged detail view partially in cross-section
of a portion of the introducer assembly shown in FIG.
1.FIG. 3 is a top plan view of the valve construction
utilized in the introducer assembly shown in FIG. 1.FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view taken along the line 4-4
of FIG. 3.FIG. 5 is a bottom plan view of the valve construction
looking along the line 5-5 in FIG. 4.FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view similar to FIG. 4 showing
an alternative construction for the valve construction shown
in FIGS. 3, 4 and 5.FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view similar to FIG. 6 and
showing another embodiment of the valve
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A valve construction (27) for use with an
introducer assembly (11) having a tubular member (13)

with a valve housing (19) at one end thereof for
receiving the valve construction (27) to permit a

medical instrument to be introduced therethrough,
comprising a body (61) formed of an elastic material,

said body (61) having a wall (62) enclosing an
axially-extending bore (63) which has first and second

ends (66,67), a first wall (71) formed integral with
the wall (62) of the body (61) and extending across

the first end (66) of the axially-extending bore (63),

said first wall (71) having a centrally-disposed
opening (73) therein aligned with said axially-extending

bore (63), a second wall (76) formed
integral with the wall (62) of the body (61) and

extending across the second end (67) of the axially-extending
bore (63), said second wall (76) having a

single slit (81) therein extending therethrough
diametrically of said axially-extending bore (63) to

provide first and second semicircular leaflets
(82,83), said axially-extending bore (63), said

opening (73) in said first wall (71) and said slit
(81) in the second wall (76) when seated in said

housing (19) permitting a medical instrument to be
introduced therethrough and through the tubular member

(13) with at least one seal being formed between the
valve construction (27) and the medical instrument,

said second wall (76) having inner and outer surfaces
(77,78), each of said leaflets (82,83) having an

arcuate base portion and a straight distal portion,
said distal portion having a thickness which is less

than the thickness of said base portion so as to
permit the leaflets (82,83) to flex and allow the 

instrument to pass therethrough, characterised in that
said axially-extending bore (63) is cylindrical and in

that said slit (81) extends diametrically of the
axially-extending cylindrical bore to said wall (62)

of the body (61), said inner and outer surfaces
(77,78) of said second wall (62) are inclined

outwardly across the axially-extending cylindrical
bore from a plane extending perpendicular to the axis

of the axially-extending cylindrical bore (63) and
inwardly towards the second end (67) of the axially-extending

bore (63), and said distal portions of said
leaflets (82,83) have a substantial thickness and abut

each other to provide a keystone-like seal so as to
avoid prolapse of the leaflets (82,83) during removal

of the instrument from the valve construction (27) and
also to provide a more positive seal as pressure is

applied to the outer surface (78) of the second wall
(76).
A valve construction as in claim 1 further
characterised in that a cylindrical reinforcing member

(92) is provided for reinforcing the same.
A valve construction as in claim 1 further
characterised in that said second wall has a

cylindrical slice formed therein to provide a
hinged region of reduced thickness for each of

the leaflets.
A valve construction as in claim 3, further
characterised in that said cylindrical slice has

a distal extremity and said second wall is
formed with a circular annular recess disposed

at the distal extremity of the cylindrical slice. 
A valve construction as in claim 1 further
characterised in that said body (61) has an inner

surface and is formed of a material having a
predetermined durometer together with a liner (143)

disposed within said bore (63) and covering said inner
surface (62), said liner (143) having a hardness

greater than that of the material forming the body
(61).
A valve construction as in claim 1 further
characterised in that the tubular member (13) has

proximal and distal extremities (17 and 18) and a
central bore (14) therein, in that a housing (19) is

provided which is mounted on the proximal extremity
(17) of the tubular member (13), in that said housing

(19) has a recess (23) therein in alignment with said
central bore (14) in said tubular member (13), in that

said valve construction (27) is disposed in said
housing (19) and in that a cap (26) is provided which

is mounted on said housing (19) which serves to retain
said valve construction (27) in said housing (19).
