<ABSTRACT>
The lymphoid surface antigen CD 30 (Ki-1) that appears during Hodgkin's disease, its protein sequence and corresponding nucleotide sequence, its production by genetic engineering, means for diagnosing and examining Hodgkin's disease, as well as the use of these nucleotide sequences to create transgenic animals are disclosed. The invention makes available means for examining and diagnosing anaplastic large-cell lymphomes that are not based on monoclonal antibodies.
