<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
process for treating water which comprises adjusting
the concentration of the polymer for water treatment in water for treatment.
More
particularly, the present invention relates to a process using a labeled polymer for water
treatment, the concentration of which in water can be measured
conveniently, accurately and quickly.Recently, various kinds of polymer are added to boiler water,
cooling water and the like for the purpose of preventing scale formation
and corrosion. As such polymers, for example, acrylic acid polymers,
maleic acid polymers and acrylamide polymers are used. For exhibiting
the effect, concentration of the polymer is generally about 1 to 100
mg/liter. When such polymers are used, it is desirable that 
the concentration of the polymer in water is kept at the minimum value
sufficient for exhibiting the effect. Addition of an excess amount of the
polymer is not only economically disadvantageous but also causes
problems that the load for waste water treatment is increased and that the
effect is even decreased depending on the kind of polymer. The
concentration of the polymer is decreased because the polymer in the water
is consumed in the system and, at the same time, lost together with the
waste water discharged from the system. Therefore, it is necessary that
the concentration of the polymer in the system is measured and the
polymer is added to the system in an amount adjusted to keep the
concentration at the optimum value.As methods of measuring the concentration of a polymer in water,
for example, the colorimetric method, turbidimetric method, lithium tracer
method and fluorescent tracer method are known. However, the
colorimetric method and the turbidimetric method are conducted by
manual operation because automatic operation is difficult with these
methods and have a drawback that the measurement requires a long
time. Measurement with the tracer methods can be conducted in a short
time and automatic operation is possible. However, they have a
drawback in that they cannot show consumption of the polymer in the
system because the measurement is made not with the polymer itself but
with another compound (a tracer) which is added simultaneously and
easily measured.As described above, the conventional methods of measurement
have a drawback in that they cannot achieve accurate and quick 
measurement of a polymer in water and, therefore, the amount of the
addition of the polymer to the system cannot be adjusted automatically in
response to changes
