<ABSTRACT>
A copier or printer producing a sequential stream of printed copy sheets with a 
limited space and time therebetween, and with compiling and finishing of those output sheets 

into plural collated finished sets on-line while subsequent sheets are being printed, an exit 
sheet feeder (16) normally feeding copy sheets downstream to a compiler tray (92) is selectably 

intermittently reversed to feed upstream the first copy sheet for the next set to be finished into 
an upstream diverter chute (30) branching off from the regular sheet output path, assisted by a 

diverter gate (24) there. The diverter chute (30) has a reversible sheet feeder (34) for feeding 
the first sheet into the diverter chute (30) and then reversing to feed the first sheet out of the 

diverter chute (30) in coordination with the passage past the diverter chute (30) of the next 
subsequent copy sheet, so that both these copy sheets are fed downstream to the exit sheet 

feeder (16) and into the compiler tray (92) together, overlapped and with a substantial increase 
in the time between the first copy sheet and the preceding copy sheets being operated on in 

the compiler tray (92). A preset difference in relative sheet edge overlapping is provided to 
insure better compiler registration. With an additional entrance gate the same diverter chute 

may alternatively be used as an inverter.

<DESCRIPTION>
There is disclosed herein an improvement for electrostatographic or other 
reproducing machines sequentially printing sheets for job sets, and more particularly an 
improved, low cost and simple system for avoiding inter-set printing delays with on-line job set 
compiling or finishing, by a system for selectably delaying sheet feeding to the compiler yet 
maintaining positive feeding control over the sheets. On-line set compiling and finishing is very desirable for the pre-collated sets of 
output copies printed and outputted sequentially by many modern high speed copiers and 
printers, for stacking and stapling or other finishing. However, the typical process of set 
collection of the printed output sheets (stacking with edge registration in a compiler tray or 
bin), and, especially, then stapling and ejecting that stapled set, takes a finite time period. The 
desired compiling and finishing time period for each collated set is often greater than the 
normal time period or pitch provided between the copy sheets, since the copy sheets are 
desirably being as rapidly sequentially printed and outputted by the copier or printer as 
possible. This has often necessitated a programmed "skipped pitch", or non-print cycle, in the 
print engine, for each set finished on-line, in many present reproduction systems. These non-print 
skipped pitches reduce overall productivity, especially for small job sets. Maximizing time between incoming sheet job sets being compiled is critical to 
desirably providing increased available compiling and finishing time. That includes the various 
times required for any active edge registration feeding or jogging, active clinching, stapling, 
and set ejection from the compiler, and other such typical sequential functions in a 
compiler/stapler unit. If the finisher is an adhesive bookbinder or thermal edge binder tape 
type, even more finishing time may be required or desired than for normal stapling. Likewise, 
for a plural staple finisher, e.g., an edge stapler, or a center spline saddle stapler or stitcher, in 
which the set is stapled more than once with the same stapler. Typically, there is also provided in a set compiler unit a driven flapper or other such 
sheet jogger for active positive registration acting on the top sheet of the stacks of sheets being 
compiled in the compiler tray. That presents additional problems if the subsequent sheet 
extends into the compiler too far before the preceding set can be removed. One prior partial solution to these problems has been to

A reproduction apparatus for producing a sequential stream of precollated 
outputted printed copy sheets into a sheet output path (12) with a limited space and time 

therebetween, and for compiling with edge registration and finishing said stream of output 
sheets into plural collated finished sets on line as subsequent said copy sheets are being printed 

and outputted by said sheet output path of said reproduction apparatus, by outputting said 
stream of copy sheets in said sheet output path downstream into a compiler tray for repeatedly 

sequentially stacking said copy sheets into collated printed sets; 

a reversible exit sheet feeder (16) upstream of said compiler tray (92) for normally 
feeding copy sheets downstream to said compiler tray (92), characterised by 
said reversible exit sheet feeder (16) being selectably intermittently reversed to 
reverse the feeding of a first copy sheet (18) therein upstream in coordination with the 

operation of said compiler tray (92) on preceding copy sheets; 
a sheet diverter chute path (30) upstream of said exit sheet feeder (16), branching off 
from said sheet output path; 
a diverter gate (24) operable for diverting said first copy sheet (18) out of said sheet 
output path into said diverter chute (30) when that first copy sheet (18) is reverse fed upstream 

by said reversible exit sheet feeder (16); 
said diverter chute (30) having another reversible sheet feeder (34) therein for, in use, first 
feeding said first sheet (18) into said diverter chute (30) and then reversing to feed said first 

sheet (18) out of said diverter chute (30) in coordination with the passage past said diverter 
chute (30) of a next subsequent second copy sheet (20), so that both said first and second copy 

sheets are fed downstream to said exit sheet feeder (16) together; 
said exit sheet feeder (16) then being operable to feed both said first and second 
sheets (18,20) together downstream to said compiler tray (92), with a substantial increase in

substantially planar and said diverter gate (16) is maintained out of said planar sheet output 

path whenever a sheet is moving downstream in said output path past said diverter gate, and 
wherein said diverter gate (16) is actuated into said output path for said deflecting of said first 

sheet (18) into said diverter chute (30) in the reverse upstream movement of said first sheet, 
and not for said second sheet.

An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, characterised by a second, differently actuated,
