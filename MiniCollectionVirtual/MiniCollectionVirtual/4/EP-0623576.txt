<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heterogeneous vanadium-phosphorus 
oxide catalyst system for the selective oxidation 

of hydrocarbons, which may or may not be saturated, comprising 
a support based on one or more metal oxides, and vanadium-phosphorus 

oxide in an amount of from 0.01 to 45 wt.%, based 
on the weight of the catalyst and calculated as (VO)₂P₂O₇, to a 

process for the selective oxidation of an organic compound in 
the presence of a vanadium-phosphorus oxide catalyst, which 

process comprises an oxidation and a reduction phase, wherein 
a hydrocarbon is contacted with said catalyst in the reduction 

phase and in oxidized or non-oxidized form is adsorbed to the 
catalyst, whereafter the thus loaded catalyst is brought into 

the oxidation phase, the desired product is formed in the 
presence of gaseous oxygen and subsequently separated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst for the selective
oxidation of hydrocarbons, which may or may not be saturated,
to oxygen-containing organic compounds. More particularly, the
invention relates to a catalyst for the selective oxidation of
hydrocarbons to oxygen-containing compounds, such as the
oxidation of n-butane to maleic acid anhydride.According to the prior art, n-butane is oxidized to
maleic acid anhydride with a good selectivity in the presence
of catalysts containing vanadium oxide and phosphate. Suitable
catalysts can be prepared in two different manners. In both
cases, the starting material is vanadium(V), whereafter the
vanadium(V) is reduced to vanadium(IV), whereafter phosphate
is added. According to the first method, hydrochloric acid is
added to the solution of vanadium(V), whereafter at elevated
temperature the vanadium is reduced with hydrogen chloride to
form chlorine. According to the second method, work is done in
an organic solvent, such as for instance i-butanol. At
elevated temperature the organic solvent reduces the dissolved
vanadium(V) which is subsequently stabilized by reaction with
the dissolved phosphate.In general the selective oxidation is carried out with an
excess of oxygen. To prevent the formation of explosive
mixtures, generally a content of 1.5 vol.% n-butane in air is
worked with. Typical is a conversion of about 90% of the
n-butane present in the feed, which is converted to maleic
acid anhydride with a selectivity of about 60%. To realize
such a conversion, the temperature of the catalyst bed must be
maintained at about 400°C. Naturally, with such an exothermic 
reaction the temperature in the catalyst bed will increase;
generally, a higher final temperature leads to a poorer
selectivity with a higher conversion. About 50% of the n-butane
supplied then becomes available as maleic acid
anhydride with the current technical implementation of the
process.Customarily, the oxidation reaction over the vanadium,
phosphorus and oxygen-containing catalysts is carried out by
passing the reactants through the reactor once, a so-called
'once through' process. One of the most important limitations
of this process, which uses a fixed catalyst bed, is that only
an n-butane concentration of 2 vol.% at most can be used;
higher n-butane contents may lead to explosions.To increase the yield of maleic acid anhydride, recently
other embodiments of the process have been proposed. One of
the successful newly proposed embodiments is a fluidized bed
reactor. It is then possible,
