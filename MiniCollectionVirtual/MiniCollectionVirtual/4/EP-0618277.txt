<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink especially
suitable for use in ink-jet printers, and more
particularly, to an ink suitable for use in conducting
recording by flying the ink out of an orifice of a
recording head by the action of thermal energy, an ink-jet
recording method and instruments making use of such an
ink.The present invention also relates to an ink
excellent in ejection stability and a production method
thereof.This invention further relates to a method of
stabilizing the fly of ink droplets.An ink-jet recording method is a recording method in
which recording is conducted by forming flying droplets of
an ink by one of various systems and applying the droplets
to a recording material such as paper.An ink-jet recording apparatus in which this kind of
recording method is adopted can conduct high-speed
printing and high-density recording with low noises. In 
addition, the apparatus itself can be miniaturized because
treatments such as development and fixing are unnecessary
to plain paper, and is good in productivity upon mass
production and produced inexpensively. Therefore, such an
apparatus has attracted special attention.In particular, an On-Demand type ink-jet recording
apparatus does not require a high-voltage generating
device and a useless-ink recovering device, which are said
to be necessary to a continuous type ink-jet recording
apparatus, and hence can be miniaturized. Therefore, its
application is promising.In particular, an ink-jet recording apparatus making
use of an ink-jet recording head described in Japanese
Patent Publication No. 61-59914, in which a part of a
liquid flow path filled with a liquid is heated to cause
the liquid to undergo pressure change attendant on volume
increase by rapid bubbling, thereby forming flying
droplets of the liquid to be ejected from an orifice
communicating with the liquid flow path, and the droplets
are than applied to a recording material to make a record
thereon, has attracted attention because it has such
advantages that since formation of a high-density multi-orifice
in the ink-jet recording head can be realized with
ease, printing speed can be enhanced by making the head
longer, and high-quality images can be provided.In the ink-jet recording head making good use of 
thermal energy for forming the flying droplets, a means
for heating an ink generally is equipped with an
electrothermal converter comprising a heating resistor
capable of generating heat by applying an electric signal
to heat the ink and an electrode for applying the
