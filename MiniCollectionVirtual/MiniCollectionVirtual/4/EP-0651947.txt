<ABSTRACT>
Esterified propoxylated glycerin compositions containing acyl groups derived 
from C₁₂-C₂₄ saturated linear fatty acids wherein at least 50 mole percent of the total 

acyl groups are derived from no more than two different such acids are useful as 
cocoa butter substitutes in the preparation of reduced calorie food products such as 

chocolate and other confectioneries. The cocoa butter substitutes closely mimic the 
desirable melting properties of natural cocoa butter, yet do not require tempering or 

conching to achieve highly satisfactory mouthfeel and appearance, and may be 
conveniently and inexpensively prepared using readily available starting materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fatty acid-esterified propoxylated glycerin
compositions which are useful as reduced calorie substitutes for cocoa butter in food
products such as chocolate and other confectioneries.Cocoa butter is a natural fat derived by hydraulic or expeller pressing or by
solvent extraction of cocoa beans. The unique melting behavior of cocoa butter
makes it highly desirable for use in chocolate and similar food products. Unlike
other triglycerides obtained from natural sources, cocoa butter exhibits a distinct
brittle fracture below 20°C (68°F), a fairly sharp and complete melting point at
about 35°C (95°F) with an incipient fusion or softening around 30-32°C (86-90°F).
A chocolate product comprising cocoa butter thus is solid at room temperature but
when consumed melts rapidly at body temperature to provide excellent non-waxy
mouthfeel and consistency.The unique physical properties of cocoa butter are attributable to the
particular combination and positional distribution of fatty acid acyl groups on the
three carbons of glycerol. Cocoa butter contains approximately equimolar
proportions of three major fatty acid acyl groups (palmitate, stearate, oleate), but
only three major molecular species despite the possibility of many additional
combinations of the dominant fatty acids. Apparently the enzymes present in the
maturing cocoa beans are capable of selectively producing these major species. As natural cocoa butter is relatively expensive compared to other more
readily available lipids, considerable effort has been devoted to developing
economical processes for synthesizing triglycerides having melting properties
analogous to cocoa butter. This objective has proven to be quite difficult to
accomplish owing to the inability of conventional esterification methods to position
the necessary fatty acid acyl groups regioselectively (i.e., at particular carbon atoms
of the glycerol).The processing of cocoa butter into acceptable confectionery products is
complicated by the fact that cocoa butter can exist in several different crystalline
forms. As certain of these crystalline forms are unstable, products containing cocoa
butter must be carefully tempered and/or seeded to give a smooth crystalline solid of
the desired firmness and mouthfeel which will keep satisfactorily without
discoloration or bloom.Bloom is a separation of fat crystals from the matrix of a cocoa butter-containing
composition, generally caused by the extrusion or recrystallization of the
cocoa butter to or on the surface with
