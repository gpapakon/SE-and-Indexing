<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of manufacturing a measuring device of the Fabry-Pérot resonator type. The invention likewise concerns a measuring device manufactured by means of the method. The measuring device is particularly intended for measurement of the pressures inside engine cylinders and comprises a cavity (6) and a first part (2) and a second part (3), said two parts sandwiching the cavity (6) between them. At least the first part (2), which consists of silicon, supports a spacer layer (4) of silicon dioxide formed through thermal oxidation. The spacer layer (4) which is partially removed through etching, is joined to the second part (3) using the technique known as direct bonding (SDB).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention concerns a method of manufacturing 
a measuring device of the kind defined in the 
preamble of claim 1. The invention also concerns a 
measuring device produced in accordance with the method. A principal application of a device in accordance 
with the present invention is to measure the pressure in 
combustion engine cylinders. To optimize the efficiency of 
the engine it is desirable to be able to instantaneously 
measure the pressure of the exhaust gases inside the 
cylinder compression space. It would be advantageous to 
incorporate a device designed for this purpose in the 
existing ignition and fuel injection system of the vehicle 
which, with the aid of electronic means of suitable 
configuration, could result in more carefully controlled 
fuel injection conditions and a more advantageous 
combustion process. Consequently, it would be possible 
to achieve a more optimized ignition point and to obtain 
more complete fuel combustion with consequential improvement 
of the engine efficiency. High pressures and temperatures and serious 
electrical disturbances are characteristic of the particularly 
extreme environmental conditions to which a 
pressure sensor that is positioned in the cylinder is 
exposed. In addition, pressure sensors of this type are to 
be installed in connection with the manufacturing process 
in a large number of vehicles produced in large series and 
thus be incorporated as one component of the electric 
system of the vehicle. A pressure sensor of this kind 
therefore must meet severe requirements with respect to 
accuracy, reliability and, not the least, low manufacturing 
costs and satisfactory reproducibility in the 
manufacturing process. In view of the environmental conditions in the 
cylinder it is difficult to effect pressure measurements 
based on direct- conversion to electrical quantities. A  
 
solution based on fibre optics according to which the 
sensor body consists mainly of silicon and the conversion 
of the signal is from pressure to a mechanical quantitiy 
which in turn is converted into an optical quantity 
transported by an optical fibre, would provide the 
advantages required to solve the measuring problem. 
However, to date no sensors exist that are able to withstand 
the environmental conditions at a cost that is 
acceptable from a production-economical point of view. Relevant devices in this aspect are pressure sensors 
based on the principle that the surrounding pressure 
affects the thickness of a cavity formed in the sensor and
