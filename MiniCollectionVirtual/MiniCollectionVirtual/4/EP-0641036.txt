<ABSTRACT>
A power divider (20) includes two orthomode tee to 
cylindrical waveguide adapters (26, 34) coupled by 

a phase shift unit (48) having a slow-wave 
structure (68) located in a sidewall (82) of a 

waveguide section (50) at a position located 45 
degrees between planes of rectangular ports of the 

adapters. The slow-wave structure includes a set 
of vanes (54) which are movable by means of a motor 

(58) to adjust their penetration through the 
sidewall of the waveguide section. Adjustment of 

the penetration provides for selection of an amount 
of differential phase lag introduced between 

components of electromagnetic waves propagating 
through the waveguide section between the two 

adapters. Pins (96) are formed integrally with the 
vanes by a notching of edge regions of the vanes. 

The pins introduced a relatively small amount of 
phase shift as compared to that introduced by the 

vanes. However, the phase dispersion of the pins 
counteracts a phase dispersion of the vanes for 

increased bandwidth of the power divider. 
Adjustment of the phase shift provides for rotation 

of an electric vector for switching an exit point 
of an electromagnetic wave between either one of 

two output ports (30, 32) or for a division among 
the two output ports in any desired average power 

ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electromagnetic
power divider according to the preamble of claim 1. More particularly, to a power
divider configured as a cylindrical waveguide
interconnecting two orthomode couplers, and having
a movable vane slow-wave structure disposed in a
sidewall of the cylindrical waveguide with pin-like protrusions (pins) in
the vanes to broaden a frequency pass band of the
power divider.An electromagnetic power divider with two orthomode couplers,
fixed relative to each other, is discribed by J. Clarke et al. (IEE, Proceedings,
Vol 130, Pt. H. No.5, August 1983, page 305-308). A central rotatable section
with a half-wave structure produces a differential phase shift along and perpenticular
to a particular longitudinal plane, causing a variable coupling of the two
orthomode couplers.One form of microwave circuit of interest
herein provides for a switching of power from any
one of two input ports to any one of two output
ports, as well as dividing the power of either of
the two input ports among the two output ports.
The circuit is to operate also in reciprocal
fashion to enable a combining of power received at
the two output ports to exit one of the input
ports.A problem arises in that previous attempts to
provide these functions have resulted in an
undesirably narrow bandwidth, as well as excessive
mechanical complexity in the provision of movement
among mechanical elements.The aforementioned problem is overcome and
other advantages are provided, in accordance with
the invention, by a microwave power divider according to claim 1. The power divide
preferably has two input ports and two output ports which are 
connected by a circular cylindrical waveguide
having a variable slow-wave structure. The
slow-wave structure is angled by 45 degrees
relative to an electric field of a TE propagating
in the circular waveguide so as to introduce a
relative delay between two orthogonal components of
the electric field. There results a change in the
orientation of the electric field by rotation of
the electric field vector about a central axis of
the circular waveguide. The two input ports are
provided by an input orthomode tee to cylindrical
waveguide adapter, and a similar output adapter
provides the two output ports.The construction of the power divider can be
visualized with the aid of an orthogonal XYZ
coordinate system wherein the Z axis coincides with
the longitudinal central axis of the circular
waveguide. Each orthomode tee has a first port,
and a second port which is perpendicular to the
f
