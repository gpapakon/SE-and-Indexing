<ABSTRACT>
Water-soluble fibre-reactive disazo compounds of the formula (1) given and defined below are described, which compounds serve as dyes for dyeing and printing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing material, in particular fibre material, such as wool and synthetic polyamide and, in particular, cellulose fibre materials, such as cotton.
