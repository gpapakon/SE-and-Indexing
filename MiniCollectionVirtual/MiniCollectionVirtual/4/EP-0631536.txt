<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing a composite material, in which a particulate carrier material is coated with uncured, possibly molten, thermosetting powder coatings, such as waste powder coatings, and the coated particles of the carrier material are heated in a mould to a temperature at which the powder coating coats of the individual particles melt and fuse together, forming a plastic matrix with the particulate carrier material distributed therein, whereupon thermal curing takes place with the formation of the composite material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for producing a composite material and 
a novel use of powder coating 
material, such as waste powder coatings. A general description of "powder coating", which may also be 
identified as "coating powder", is found in Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia 
of Chemical Technology, 3rd Edition, Vol. 19, pp. 1-27. The present invention in particular relates to the use of 
thermosetting powder coatings which melt, for example, between 100 
and 150째C and set, for example, between 150 and 200째C. During the 
application, said powders are charged electrostatically and are 
sprayed onto the object to be coated. The powder which does not land 
on the object is recovered with the aid of a recovery device, for 
example a cyclone. Sometimes this powder cannot be reused, for 
example towards the end of the treatment of a batch of objects. 
Waste powder is also produced when the colour is changed, because 
powder is formed with a contaminated colour, which is no longer 
usable as a coating. Furthermore, the manufacturer of powder 
coatings also has to face the powder coating waste problem because 
certain batches can no longer or must no longer be distributed 
commercially. Hitherto, waste powder from the powder coating industry has 
been destroyed in special combustion plants, causing considerable 
environmental problems. The invention is designed to overcome this problem, and it 
makes efficient use of the waste powder from the powder-coating 
production and processing industry. Attempts to find a solution for 
a useful application of this waste powder by mixing this powder with 
other (plastic) materials and melting it failed as it appeared that 
a uniform, homogeneous melt could not be obtained. The present invention is based on the surprising finding that 
a particulate carrier material may be coated first with a thermosetting 
powder coating and, subsequently, the individual particles 
are fused together. Although one would expect that such a technique 
would be suitable for thermoplastic powders, it is surprising that 
thermosetting powder coatings may find a useful application by such 
a technique.  
 Accordingly, it was surprisingly found that coating powder 
can be used for producing composite material. The invention therefore relates to a process for producing a 
composite material, in which a particulare carrier material is 
coated with uncured, possibly molten, thermosetting powder coatings, 
such as waste powder coatings, and the coated particles of the 
carrier material are heated

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing a composite material, in which a 
particulate carrier material is coated with uncured, possibly 

molten, thermosetting powder coatings, such as waste powder 
coatings,in which the carrier material is coated by heating the 

particles of the carrier material to a temperature above the melting 
point of the powder coating and dipping the heated carrier material 

particles into the powder coating, and the coated particles of the 
carrier material are heated in a mould to a temperature at which the 

powder coating coats of the individual particles melt and fuse together, 
forming a plastic matrix with the particulate carrier 

material distributed therein, whereupon thermal curing takes place 
with the formation of the composite material. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which the carrier 
material is used in the form of grains, beads or fibres. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
in which the carrier material is chosen from ceramic materials such 

as baked clay, (blast furnace) slags, lava (pumice), glass, 
naturally occurring materials such as gravel, sand and wood or other 

products such as paper, plastics, (sintered) fly ash or metal. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
in which the particles of the carrier material have dimensions of 

0.1 mm - 5 cm, preferably 1 mm - 2 cm. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
in which the powder coating is a polyester, for example triglycidyl 

isocyanurate (TGIC). 
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
in which the melting point range and the curing temperature range 

partially overlap each other, but in such a way that the centre of 
the melting range is below that of the curing range, and in  

 
particular the melting point of the powder coating is between 130 

and 150째C, and the curing temperature between 170 and 190째C. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
in which the coating of the carrier material is carried out by 

passing the carrier material, which has been heated to above the 
melting point of the powder coating, through a fluidised bed of the 

powder coating. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
in which the thickness of the uncured powder coating coat of the 

carrier material is 0.1-5 mm, preferably 1-3 mm. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
in which the powder coating material used as the coat is admixed 

with a blowing agent which boils or is decomposed at a temperature 
above the melting point of the powder coating. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
in which, in addition, reinforcing means such as glass fibres, 

carbon fibres or aramid fibres are used. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
in which the porosity of the composite material is controlled by 

adjusting the starting temperature of the particulate carrier 
material. 
Use of powder coatings, such as waste powder coatings, 
for producing composite material comprising a plastic matrix of 

cured powder coating material with particulate carrier material 
distributed therein.
