<ABSTRACT>
In a process for joining corrugated-tube pipe pieces (12, 13) to form a pipe, which is to be used in particular as a protective pipe for communication cables or optical waveguides, outer pipe sections (5a) are formed in the region of the outer pipe areas (5) by corresponding cutting off and these outer pipe sections are fitted into recesses (22, 23) of welding sleeves (16). These welding sleeves (16) have an outer ring (18) and an inner ring (17), the inner ring (17) not protruding into the pipe radially beyond the inner pipe sections (4). At least one of the rings (17, 18) is welded to the outer pipe sections (5a).

A method for welding two pipe pieces (12, 13) of corrugated pipes (1)
made of thermoplastics, which pipe pieces (12, 13) only consist of corrugated

portions (3) with internal pipe portions (4) and external pipe portions
(5) alternately succeeding in the direction of a central longitudinal axis (2)

and with substantially radial flanks (6, 7) interconnecting these two portions,
characterized by
 the following method steps

two pipe pieces (12, 13) are used, which end with one front surface
(14, 15) each in a cylindrical external pipe segment (5a) of an external

pipe portion (5) of a corrugated portion (3);
the pipe pieces (12, 13) are pushed with their external pipe segments
(5a) into annular recesses (22, 23; 22'', 23'') of a welding sleeve (16,

16', 16'', 16''') made of thermoplastics, the welding sleeve (16, 16', 16'',
16''') partially surrounding each external pipe segment (5a), received by

the sleeve, by means of an outer ring (18, 18'', 18''') and an inner ring
(17, 17', 17'', 17''') and containing electric heating elements adjacent to

the recesses (22, 23; 22'', 23''), and the inner ring (17, 17', 17'', 17''')
being located exclusively between the external pipe segment (5a) and

the internal pipe portion (4) radially to the central longitudinal axis (2);
the outer ring (18, 18'', 18''') and/or the inner ring (17, 17', 17'', 17''') on
the one hand and the external pipe segment (5a) on the other hand are

plastified at least in the region where they are adjacent to each other by
actuating the electric heating element with electric current;
during the plastifying process the pipe pieces (12, 13) are pressed towards
each other in the direction of the aligning axes (2) until the annular 

recesses (22, 23; 22'', 23'') are filled at least substantially with the
plastically deformed external pipe segments (5a); and
the electric current is cut off, and the external pipe segments (5a) are
connected with the welding sleeve (16, 16', 16'', 16''') by cooling down.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a welding sleeve
(16, 16', 16'', 16''') is used, the inner ring (17, 17', 17'', 17''') of which and

the outer ring (18, 18'', 18''') of which are interconnected by a middle web
(19) separating the two recesses (22, 23; 22'', 23'') from each other.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 a welding
sleeve (16, 16') is used, in the outer ring (18) of which an electric resistance

heating (24) is arranged.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 a welding
sleeve (16''') is used, in the inner ring (17''') of which an electric resistance

heating (24''') is arranged.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 a
welding sleeve (16') is used, the inner ring (17') of which is provided with a

stiffening inlay (29).
A method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 a resistance
heating (30) separated from the welding sleeve (16'') is used, which resistance

heating (30) is placed on an external pipe segment (5a) to be inserted
into the respective recess (22'', 23''). 
A method according to one of claims 2 to 6, 
characterized in that
 welding
sleeves (16, 16', 16'', 16''') are used, the annular recesses (22, 23; 22'',

23'') of which slightly taper from front faces (20, 21) of the welding sleeve
(16, 16', 16'', 16''') towards the middle web (19).
