<ABSTRACT>
A method of implanting an acetabular cup which 
includes preparing an acetabular socket to receive said cup, 

placing cement in said socket before or after locating a 
tube in line with said socket and inserting the acetabular 

cup through the tube and into said socket.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for implanting an 
acetabular cup which is to be held in place by cement. It is known, for example, from the Charnley (type) ogee Flanged 
Cup to provide a flange on the cup to pressurise the cement but this 
only occurs as the cup approaches its final position in the 
acetabulum. The flexible flange touches the acetabular margin ending 
to occlude cement flow. Another device for pressuring cement is known as the Exeter 
Acetabular Pressuriser. In this arrangement a water filled seal 
mounted on the end of a handle is used after the acetabulum has been 
filled with cement but before the cup is introduced, the seal covers 
the acetabulum and the surgeon pushes on the handle thereby forcing the 
doughy cement in the holes, ridges and trabeculae. When the instrument 
is removed and pressure is released blood flow can squeeze between the 
cement and the bone. It is also known to provide cup positioning instruments with 
long pointers (vertical, horizontal and at right angles to the 
patient's centre line of body symmetry) to enable the surgeon to 
control cup orientation reasonably well provided the pelvis does not 
move. Linear positioning of the cup is determined by eye in a 
medio-lateral and anterio-posterior sense. If the natural acetabulum 
is well formed a by-eye judgement can be acceptable but many acetabulae 
are deformed or eroded in which case by-eye judgement can be confused. A further method is to use what are usually referred to as 
acetabular spacers. These can be lugs fixed to the outside of the 
acetabular cup or can be press studs pushed into the bone base of the 
natural acetabulum. These prevent the cup from being pushed too 
deeply into the acetabular socket and can control medio-lateral and 
anterio-posterior positioning. However, they force some degree of 
centralisation of the cup. If the surgeon chooses to place the cup  
 
eccentrically to make use of a particular area of solid bone support, 
acetabular spacers do not help. WO-A-8504567 shows a construction in which a flexible plastic 
sleeve is attached to the bone around the acetabular recess so that 
when cement is deposited therein it does not spread to other bone 
surfaces. The sleeve is made from flexible material and its internal 
diameter is greater than the diameter of the cup to be inserted. 
However no guidance or control is provided and the cup can be inserted 
at any position or attitude in the cement. The present invention is intended to provide apparatus for 
overcoming some of the
