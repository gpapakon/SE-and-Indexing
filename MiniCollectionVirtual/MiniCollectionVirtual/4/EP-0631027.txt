<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to garage or store two-wheelers (12, 14, 16), such as bicycles, in an extremely constricted amount of space, the invention proposes a tower-like garaging facility (10) having a plurality of levels (18, 20) which are arranged one above the other and receive the two-wheelers (12, 14, 16) in garaging areas (22, 24). In order to permit garaging or removal of the two-wheelers automatically and in short access times, the two-wheelers can be conveyed to, or removed from, the levels via a lifting apparatus (26), said lifting apparatus carrying out lifting/lowering movements one after the other or in a superimposed manner and carrying out a rotational movement about an axis of rotation (54).
