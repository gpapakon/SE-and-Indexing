<ABSTRACT>
A tightening tool 1 including an elastic body 2 in the form of a 
belt, rope, tube, etc. for forming a tightening loop L adapted to 

surround a desired part of muscles and tighten it, and locking means 3 
for holding the tightening loop L at a desired size. A muscle training 

method for accelerating enlargement and strengthening of the muscles can 
be practiced by using the tightening tool to temporarily block the flow 

of blood to the desired part of the muscles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an accessory tool to
be used for muscle building and also to a muscle building
method using the accessory tool.In muscle building, muscular strength and/or size is
generally increased by applying a load to a desired muscle
or group of muscles using a weight such as a dumbbell or
barbell, or using resistance based on elasticity, for
example, of a spring, rubber, or other resilient material,
and by carrying out exercises to stretch and contract the
desired muscle in such a loaded condition to such a degree
as to obtain a given fatigue. Using this type of exercise,
the muscle building effect is improved only by increasing
the weight or the resistance of the training tool or by
increasing the number of exercises carried out. However,
even when the load to the desired muscle is unduly
increased, an increased quantity of the load is dispersed
to other muscles. As a result, the other muscles are
undesirably strengthened, and in some cases, the muscles or
joints may be damaged.Many studies on the effect of exercise on the muscles
have been made including studies of the determination of
causes of muscle fatigue, muscular growth and the
relationship between muscles and load. As a result of
these studies, it is known that muscles are fatigued as
soon as the flow of blood is restricted, that isometric
muscle contraction caused by lifting or supporting a heavy
object is more effective for enlargement of the muscles
than isotonic muscle contraction caused by running or
swimming, and that muscular strength is more effectively
developed by applying a load at a given level which can be
increased. In a publication from 1967, it was reported
that exercise with the flow of blood restricted remarkably
enhances muscular strength though a fundamental mechanism
thereof has not yet been clarified [see "Sports Medicine", 
ed. Eiichiro Hisamatsu and Michio Ikai, (K.K. Kyorin Shoin
and Taiiku-no-kagakusha, September 20, 1967) 4th ed., pp
203 and 206].The present inventor has long been concerned with the
study of muscle building to search for an effective
training tool and a training method using it. However, the
current thinking regarding sports and training is that it
is important that the flow of blood to the muscles should
be efficient and should be accelerated to supply oxygen to
the muscles and thereby prevent build up of lactic acid
which causes fatigue. Accordingly, the publication by
Hisamatsu and Ikai referenced above is directly opposed to
the presently accepted understanding of sports

<CLAIMS>
A tightening tool for sports training comprising an
elastic member (2) which is arranged to form a loop (L) of

variable circumference for encircling a selected part of a
limb, and locking means (3,6) for holding the loop formed

from the flexible member during use at a desired
circumference; characterised in that the tool comprises at

least a detecting portion of indicating means (10) for
detecting the force exerted by the loop on the encircled

part of a limb, in use.
A tool according to claim 1, additionally comprising
a lining (4), which, in use, is innermost along the

circumference of the loop formed from the elastic member
(2) .
A method for enlarging a muscle of a human being, the
method comprising encircling a selected part of a limb with

a loop of the tightening tool according to claim 1 or claim
2, and reducing the circumference of the loop to tighten

the loop thereby restricting flow of blood to the muscle to
be enlarged.
A method according to claim 3, wherein the reduced
circumference of the loop is maintained while the muscle is

exercised.
A method according to claim 4, wherein the exercise
involves contracting the muscle isometrically or

isotonically.
A method according to any one of claims 3 to 5, in
which the reduced circumference of the loop is maintained

for no greater than 30 minutes. 
A method according to claim 6, wherein the reduced
circumference of the loop is maintained for no greater than

15 minutes.
