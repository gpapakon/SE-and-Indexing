<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a silicone-based coating composition in the form 
of an aqueous dispersion of organopolysiloxanes suitable for the 

surface treatment of a rubber article to impart the surface with excellent 
lubricity and abrasion resistance so as to be useful for upgrading, 

for example, wind shields in automobiles. The coating 
composition comprises, as the effective ingredients, four organopolysiloxanes 

each in the form of an aqueous dispersion or solution 
including (a) an organopolysiloxane having a branched molecular 

structure consisting of two types of the siloxane units of the general 
formulas R¹₂SiO and R¹SiO
1.5
, in which R¹ is a monovalent 
hydrocarbon group, (b) a hydrolysis-condensation product of an 

epoxy group-containing dialkoxy silane compound, (c) a 
hydrolysis-condensation product of an aminoalkyl group-containing 

dialkoxy silane compound and (d) cured silicone rubber particles 
in a specified proportion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coating composition for the
surface treatment of a rubber article or, more particularly, to a
coating composition for the surface treatment of a rubber article
which can be imparted with improved abrasion resistance and
smoothness or lubricity on the surface by the treatment therewith.
The invention relates also to a method for the improvement of the
abrasion resistance and lubricity of the surface of a rubber article.Needless to say, the application fields of rubber articles are
so wide in the modern industries that some of the industries can no
longer exist without rubber articles indispensable in various parts.
Automobiles are built with a variety of rubber parts, of which
weather strips of a cured rubber are used for waterproof sealing in
the doors, windshields, rear windows, trunk room lids and elsewhere.
Rubber-made weather strips in automobiles are used sometimes
with rubbing on the surface or in contact with other parts in
a sliding movement so that weather strips are required to have
good abrasion resistance of the surface and good lubricity on the
surface in order to decrease the friction thereon. One of the methods
to meet this requirement is to coat the surface of the rubber article
with a urethane resin-based coating composition disclosed in,
for example, Japanese Patent Kokai No. 3-20376, No. 3-21675, No. 
3-21676, No. 3-86774, No. 3-252477, No. 4-8778, No. 4-8779, No. 4-25580,
No. 4-25581, No. 4-31474 and elsewhere or a silicone resin-based
coating composition disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai No.
54-90369, Japanese Patent Publications No. 56-47864 and No. 4-80072
and elsewhere.The above mentioned urethane resin-based coating compositions
are, however, not practically satisfactory for the purpose due
to the relatively poor weatherability of the coating film formed
therefrom so that the improvement in the surface properties of the
rubber articles coated therewith is not durable enough. Though
somewhat superior in the weatherability as compared with urethane
resin-based coating compositions, the silicone resin-based
coating compositions are also not quite satisfactory in respects of
the adhesion of the coating film to the rubber surface and the abrasion
resistance of the coating film. In addition, the surface lubricity
of the rubber articles such as weather strips coated with a silicone
resin-based coating composition is not so high that, when the
weather strips are used in automobiles, creaking noises are sometimes
generated from running automobiles due
