<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an expression system comprising a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide which has a biological activity of human  kappa -casein, the system comprising a 5'-flanking sequence capable of mediating expression of said DNA sequence. In preferred embodiments the 5'-flanking sequence is from a milk protein gene of a mammal such as a casein gene or whey acidic protein (WAP) gene and the DNA sequence contains at least one intron sequence. The invention further relates to DNA sequences, replicable expression vectors and cells harbouring said vectors, recombinant polypeptide e.g. in glycosylated form, and milk, infant formula or nutrient supplement comprising recombinant polypeptide. The invention also relates to a method for producing a transgenic non-human mammal comprising injecting an expression system as defined above and optionally a further DNA encoding  beta -casein or an analogue, variant or subsequence thereof into a fertilized egg or a cell of an embryo of a mammal so as to incorporate the expression system into the germline of the mammal and developing the resulting injected fertilized egg or embryo into an adult female mammal. In one embodiment, the endogenous polypeptide expressing capability of the mammal is destroyed and/or replaced with the expression system defined above. The invention further relates to a transgenic non-human mammal such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, pig, lama, camel or bovine species whose germ cells and somatic cells contain a DNA sequence as defined above as a result of chromosomal incorporation into the non-human mammalian genome, or into the genome of an ancestor of said non-human mammal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide
comprising amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:2 or analogue-or variant there of which
has at least 95% sequence identity with said polypeptide and a biological activity of human κ-casein. In a particular embodiment, the DNA sequence encodes a
polypeptide having the amino acid sequence 21-182 OF SEQ ID NO:2
below. The DNA sequence is advantageously used in the production of
recombinant human κ-casein or an analogue or variant thereof as described above, either
by means of a prokaryotic or an eukaryotic production system, or more
advantageously by means of production in transgenic non-human mammals
such as bovine species, e.g. cows. One main use of the recombinant
human κ-casein is as a constituent of infant formulae used for feeding
infants as a substitute for human milk. When used as a constituent
of infant formulae, it is contemplated that the recombinant human
κ-casein provides a substantial improvement of the nutritional and
biological value of the formulae in that a closer similarity to human
milk is obtained. It is contemplated that the recombinant proteins
can also be used in a number of other embodiments.due to the advantageous
properties of human κ-casein and can be used e.g. as pharmaceuticals.It is well known that human milk-feeding is considered superior to
formula-feeding for infants. Not only does human milk provide a well-balanced
supply of nutrients, but it is also easily digested by the
infant. Thus, several biologically active components which are known
to have physiological functions in the infant are either a constituent
of human milk or produced during the digestion thereof, including
components involved in the defense against infection and components
facilitating the uptake of nutrients from human milk.In spite of the great efforts which have been invested in preparing
infant formulae, it has not been possible to produce a formula which
to substantial extent has all the advantageous properties of human
milk. Thus, infant formula, often prepared on the basis of cow milk.
is generally incompletely digested by the infant and is lacking 
substances known to have effect on the physiological functions of the
infant. In order to obtain an infant formula with a nutritional value
similar to human milk, a number of additives including proteins,
protein fragments, vitamins, minerals etc., which are normally formed
or taken up during the infant's digestion of human milk, are included
in the formula with the consequent risk of
