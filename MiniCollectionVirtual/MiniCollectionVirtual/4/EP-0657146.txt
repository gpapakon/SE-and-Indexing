<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for supporting 
a flexible, biocompatible membrane (9) of the type which 

is arranged between the soft tissue (8) and the bone 
tissue, for example the jaw bone (7), of a human or an 

animal, so that a space (10) is formed between the 
membrane and the bone tissue for the purpose of 

establishing bone growth in this space. The device 
comprises a central annular part (1) for connection to an 

implant (4) which is anchored in the bone tissue, and a 
peripheral part (2, 2a) which is intended to extend out 

over the space in which bone growth is sought and to form 
a support for the flexible membrane (9). The peripheral 

part consists of one or more wire loops (2, 2a) in which 
the wire is made of a biocompatible material, preferably 

titanium, and can easily be bent by hand and shortened if 
necessary upon application, while being sufficiently 

stiff to maintain its shape after bending. The invention 
can also be used in conjunction with bone transplants, 

the transplant being held in place, during the 
incorporation period, by the peripheral wire loop which 

is bent over the transplant and clamps the latter 
securely against the existing bone tissue. It is 

therefore possible to dispense with the screws or pins 
previously used for the fixing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
promoting bone growth in connection with an implant
anchored in the bone tissue, for example in the jaw bone.The device comprises a central part for
connection to the implant, and a peripheral part intended
to extend out over the area where bone growth is sought
and to form a support either for a flexible,
biocompatible membrane of the type which is arranged
between the soft tissue and the bone tissue or for a bone
transplant applied in connection with the implant.A device comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1
is disclosed in WO-A-91/14404.A growth of bone tissue is especially desirable
in those cases where the jaw bone has been resorbed to
such a great extent that the existing bone volume is too
small to allow the use of releasable or firmly anchored
dental prostheses. In the case of dental bridges anchored
in the jaw bone, a certain minimum bone volume must be
left in order to permit sufficient anchoring of a number
of fixtures in the bone tissue.It is already known to regenerate bone tissue by
forming between the soft tissue and the bone tissue a
space in which bone tissue can then grow freely. In the
case where bone growth is sought in connection with a
fixture, the space can be formed for example by mounting
a dimensionally stable, cap-shaped element on the fixture
so that its peripheral part extends out over an area
around the fixture. A device of this type is described in
SE 468 339.Another method for creating good conditions for
bone growth is to place a flexible membrane of the GORE-TEX®
type over the area where the bone needs to be
strengthened. In this case too the membrane is placed
between the bone tissue and the soft tissue, i.e. the
gingival connective tissue, so that a space is formed
between the tissues and so that the connective tissue is
prevented from growing into the space. The GORE-TEX
membrane consists of a porous polytetrafluoroethylene
material (e-PTFE) which has been shown to have good 
biocompatibility and a microstructure which allows gas to
penetrate through the membrane but which prevents
undesired growth of cells through the membrane. The
membrane technique is described for example in
Generation of New Bone Around Titanium Implants
Using a Membrane Technique. The Int. Journal of
Oral & Maxillofacial Implants, Vol. 4, No. 1,
1989, p. 19 - 25, andGORE-TEX® Augmentation Material. c 1991 by W. L.
GORE & Associates Inc. 9/91.By virtue of its flexibility, the membrane is
easy to connect round the defective area. In order

<CLAIMS>
Device for promoting bone growth in connection
with an implant (4) anchored in bone tissue, for example

in the jaw bone (7), comprising a central part (1) for
connection to the implant, and a peripheral part (2, 2a)

intended to extend out over the area where bone growth is
sought and to form a support either for a flexible,

biocompatible membrane (9) of the type which is arranged
between the soft tissue (8) and the bone tissue or for a

bone transplant (18) applied in connection with the
implant (4), characterized in that the peripheral part

consists of one or more wire loops (2, 2a) in which the
wire is made of a biocompatible material, preferably

titanium, and can easily be bent by hand and if necessary
shortened upon application, but which is stiff enough to

maintain its shape after bending.
Device according to Patent Claim 1, characterized
in that the peripheral part is intended to form a base

for the membrane (9) and in this way maintain a space
(10) between the membrane (9) and the bone tissue in

order to permit bone growth in the said space.
Device according to Patent Claim 1, characterized
in that the peripheral part is intended to hold secure,

during an incorporation process, the bone transplant (18)
appl
ied in connection with the implant (4).
Device according to Patent Claim 1, characterized
in that its peripheral part (2, 2a) consists of two

opposite wire loops (2, 2a) which extend in a fan shape
out from the central part (1).
Device according to Patent Claim 2, characterized
in that the two opposite wire loops (2, 2a) are

asymmetrical, so that one wire loop is larger than the
other.
Device according to Patent Claim 3, characterized
in that the wire consists of titanium wire having a

thickness of the order of magnitude of 0.5 mm.
Device according to Patent Claim 1, characterized
in that the central part (1) is annular and is arranged, 

upon application, to bear against the flange (3) of the
implant anchored in the bone tissue with a lower end

surface (12) which has essentially the same external
diameter as the flange (3).
Device according to Patent Claim 7, characterized
in that the central annular part (1) is locked in the

correct position with respect to the implant (4) by means
of a locking screw (5) whose head (6) bears against the

upper end surface (13) of the annular part, and whose
threaded part engages with the internal thread of the

implant.
Device according to Patent Claim 8, characterized
in that the upper end surface (13) comprises two

essentially parallel grooves (14, 14a) in which the wire
loop (2, 2a) has been fixed, for example by press-fitting

or welding.
