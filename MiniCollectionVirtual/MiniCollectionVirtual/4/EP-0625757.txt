<ABSTRACT>
Method and system for storing and selectively retrieving information, such as words, 
from a document set. The method includes generating an image data set representative of the 

information contained in the document set. The method also involves generating a text data set 
representative of a text portion of the information contained in the document set. A text-image 

correspondence (TIC) table is generated that includes data representative of coordinates 
information corresponding to each phrase of the document set. A search phrase is identified in 

response to user-specified search criteria and the search phrase is identified in the text image 
data set. Then, the TIC table is used to identify the coordinates information corresponding to 

the search phrase identified in the text data set. A display of the portion of the page containing 
the search phrase is generated using the coordinates information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of document storage and retrieval
systems of the type used for multiple document manipulation. Specifically, the invention
relates to a method and system for storing documents as both text and graphics, searching a
document set for a search term, then generating a graphics display of the portion of a page from
the document set containing the search term.Electronic storage of documents has facilitated the handling of large volumes of
documents, such as those handled by hospitals, universities, government institutions, and the
like. Typically, the documents are entered into massive storage systems by use of a scanner
system that converts text into electronic data. Documents primarily containing text can readily
be scanned and stored in various electronic forms in this manner. It is also possible to both
scan a document and perform optical character recognition on the document to create stored text
and image versions of the document.Once the documents are stored, there is a need to retrieve selected documents, or
selected pages from the documents. For example, a hospital may choose to maintain all patient
charts in a computer storage system, and have the ability to selectively call up a document for
viewing and editing.Typical existing systems address the need for selectively retrieving a document by
assigning an index to the document as it is entered into storage. The index may be a system-generated
or a user-defined code. The code then is stored together with the document. To
retrieve a document, a user must enter the appropriate code associated with the desired
document. Other systems use predetermined key words extracted from the document which
the user may then use to subsequently retrieve a document. The problem encountered with such systems is that a user must know the index, or
code, associated with a desired document. If a user enters an inappropriate index or code, then
the target document may not be retrieved.In one presently available commercial system for document storage and retrieval,
documents are stored in both text and graphics form A user may enter a search term, which
may be any term in the document and is not limited to a predetermined index term. The
retrieved document may then be displayed in both text form and graphics form. However, the
system retrieves an entire page of the document containing the search word. Since most screen
displays do not have the capacity for full page text display, the user must search through the
text on
