<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a composite
laminate, more particularly a cross-ply laminate, in which process
unidirectionally oriented (UD) fibres provided with not yet
consolidated matrix material are passed through a laminating zone in
layers of at least two different orientational directions, and the
matrix material is consolidated. More particularly, the invention
relates to the manufacture of composite material which is
pre-eminently suited to be used as a substrate for a printed circuit,
i.e. a printed wire board, hereinafter referred to by the abbreviation
PWB.Such a method is known from EP 478 051. This document discloses the
continuous manufacture of a flat substrate from a fibre-reinforced
matrix, which process comprises the use of at least two moving layers
of parallel, rectilinearly extending reinforcing fibres not bonded in
the form of a woven fabric (UD fibres), providing said UD fibres,
which are positioned in at least two crossing directions, with matrix
material, and passing them through a laminating zone, for instance a
double belt press, to form a cross-ply laminate. By this process
laminates may be obtained which are pre-eminently suitable as PWB
substrate on account of, int. al., their good surface area quality,
their comparatively low linear thermal coefficient of expansion (TCE)
in the x and y directions, the option of incorporating a high content
of fibres, and their favourable dimensional stability.A drawback to the known method is that the laying of the fibres in two
directions and their being provided with matrix material before or
after said laying, prior to the curing of the matrix material provided
with fibres, requires a comparatively complex apparatus. Another
disadvantage is that in order to retain the desired orientation, 
generally 90°, the UD fibres must be kept under tension throughout the
entire process. Also, it is desired to increase the process's yield of
material.Another method of manufacturing a UD layer-reinforced composite
laminate, which likewise is intended to be used as a PWB substrate, is
known from US 4,943,334. In this process reinforcing filaments are
wound about a square flat mandrel in several layers crossing at an
angle of 90°, with the filaments being provided with curable matrix
material by means of injection and/or impregnation. The matrix, which
in consequence contains cross-wise applied UD fibre layers, is then
cured. An advantage of this method is the low coefficient of expansion
attainable in the thus manufactured
