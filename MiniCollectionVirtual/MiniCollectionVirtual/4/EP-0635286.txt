<ABSTRACT>
The sliding board, especially a snowboard, assembled from two skis (1) and a central part (2) by means of fixing parts (3, 4), has a clamping means (5) in the central region, by means of which the skis (1) can be clamped against each other with distortion in the transverse direction so that any desired radius of curvature at the waist of the sliding board can be set.

Sliding board, in particular snowboard, consisting of two 
skis (1), in particular cross-country skis, and fittings (3, 

4, 5) for joining the skis (1) together, characterised in 
that at least in the central region of the skis (1) is 

provided a clamping means (5) which connects the two skis 
and by which the two skis (1) can be clamped together in the 

transverse direction while being deformed, so that the 
sliding board in the braced state has a substantially 

smaller waist radius than the individual skis (1) in the 
unbraced state and in that at least in the region of the 

points of the skis and the ends of the skis, distances which 
can be fixed by fittings (3, 4) can be adjusted between the 

skis (1). 
Sliding board according to claim 1, characterised in that 
by the fittings (4) a selectable distance between the skis 

(1) can be adjusted and in that the waist of the sliding 
board can be adjusted with at least partially remaining 

distance between the skis (1). 
Sliding board according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the fittings (4) include clips (12) or sleeves (21) 

arranged in the region of the points of the skis and in the 
region of the ends of the skis, and connecting rods (13) 

passing through the clips or sleeves, wherein the connecting 
rods when they are inserted in the clips (12) or sleeves 

(21) prevent a difference in height between the skis (1) 
connected to each other, but allow the mutual distance 

between the individual skis to be adjusted freely. 
Sliding board according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that, to adjust a selectable distance 

between the skis (1), the clips are designed as clamping 

clips (12) and can be clamped fast on the connecting rods 
(13).  

 
Sliding board according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that, to adjust a distance between the skis 

(1), on the connecting rods (13) are provided fixed stops 
(13.3) or adjustable stops. 
Sliding board according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that between the two skis (1) can be 

inserted a single-piece or multi-piece, transversely or 
longitudinally split central portion (2) which, with the 

exception of the regions associated with the points of the 
skis and the ends of the skis, has a shaping on account of 

which, when the skis (1) are in contact with the two end 
regions on the central portion (2), a gap (18) widening from 

both ends towards the centre of the skis remains. 
Sliding board according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the central portion (2) in the front region is adapted to 

the shape of the points of the skis and in the rear region 
is adapted to the shape of the ends of the skis, and in that 

the region in between comprises boundaries (2.1) extending 
parallel to each other. 
Sliding board according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the central portion (2) in the front region is adapted to 

the shape of the points of the skis and in the rear region 
is adapted to the shape of the ends of the skis, and in that 

the region in between is waisted. 
Sliding board according to any of claims 6 to 8, 
characterised in that the central portion (2) comprises 

fittings (12) for receiving the connecting rods (13). 
Sliding board according to any of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that in the central region of the skis (1) 

and of the central portion (2) are provided socket-type 
connections (3) which in the assembled state prevent a 

difference in height between the portions connected to each  
 

other, but allow the mutual distance between skis (1) and 
central portion (2) to be freely adjusted. 
Sliding board according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the fittings (3, 4) are embedded in 

the skis (1) and/or in the central portion (2). 
Sliding board according to claim 11, characterised in 
that the connecting rods (13) are attached to the central 

portion (2). 
Sliding board according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the central portion (2) acts as a spacer for the skis 

(1). 
Sliding board according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the connecting rods (13) in the 

regions (13a) associated with the skis (1) are bent at an 
angle to their central region (13b). 
Sliding board according to any of claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that the clamping means (5) consists of a 

tension lock. 
Sliding board according to any of claims 1 to 15, 
characterised in that the skis (1) are offset from each 

other in the longitudinal direction.
