<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of proton-electron double-resonance magnetic resonance imaging in which a sample containing paramagnetic material is subjected to a polarizing magnetic field during a polarisation period, a subsequent evolution period and thereafter a detection period, and the sample is subjected during the evolution period to radio-frequency radiation, at a frequency appropriate to the polarizing magnetic field then appertaining, so as to excite EPR resonance in the paramagnetic material, wherein during the detection period the sample is subjected to a series of NMR interrogating signals to derive therefrom a corresponding series of NMR image signals for combination in a complete NMR image. Preferably, the method according to the invention incorporates the technique of field cycling and the polarizing magnetic field is reduced from a first steady value during the polarization period to have a second, lower, value during the evolution period, being thereafter increased to have a value greater than the second value (and preferably equal to or less than the first value) during the detection period.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of obtaining images representing the
distribution of paramagnetic material in solution, including free radicals. The
invention has application interalia in the determination of the distribution of free
radicals, which may have been previously injected, in living tissue.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging using methods analogous to
those employed in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging but at much higher
nutation frequencies is known. However, in view of the strong magnetic field
gradients necessary to achieve good spatial resolution, EPR imaging has so far been
restricted to small samples.It is also known that if nuclei of a solvent in which paramagnetic material is
dissolved are excited to nuclear magnetic resonance and the NMR resonance is
observed, a dramatic enhancement of the observed NMR signal may be obtained if the
paramagnetic material is simultaneously excited to EPR resonance. This
phenomenon, known as Proton-Electron Double-Resonance Imaging (PEDRI), may
be utilised to obtain image information regarding the spatial distribution of
paramagnetic material in solution, and our US Patent No. 4891593 discloses a method
of obtaining image information representing the distribution of paramagnetic material
in solution which comprises the steps of applying radio-frequency radiation to excite
EPR resonance in the solute and obtaining an NMR image signal of selected nuclei
(preferably protons) of the solvent, the signal from those selected nuclei which
interact with electrons excited by the rf radiation being enhanced.As will be understood, the solution to which this method is applied may be
inhomogenously distributed in a sample, of living tissue, for example, and the
enhanced parts of the obtained NMR image then represent the spatial distribution of
the paramagnetic material within the tissue sample.The NMR signal enhancement, which occurs in regions of the sample where
paramagnetic material is present and influences the NMR proton relaxation rate, and
which appears in the final image as a locally increased intensity of the image, may be 
defined as E = Az/Ao, where Az and Ao are the NMR signals with and without EPR
irradiation. It is known that E depends on the concentration of the paramagnetic
solute and on the square of the EPR irradiation radiofrequency magnetic field which
is in turn proportional to the power of the EPR irradiation. If the conductivity of the
sample is assumed to be constant, the power of the EPR irradiation required to
produce a
