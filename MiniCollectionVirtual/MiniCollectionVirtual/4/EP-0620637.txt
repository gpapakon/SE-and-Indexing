<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a very high speed precision
composite amplifier for use in, among others, oscilloscope
signal conditioning, according to the preamble of claim 1
where the open-loop high-speed precision amplifier can be a
degenerated long tail pair amplifier.Very high speed amplifiers (1-2 GHz frequency range) often use
open loop or local feedback architecture and the active
devices used require a high frequency gain (fT = 10-12 GHz).
These devices are of very small geometries in order to reduce
the high frequency parasitic components. The unfortunate
consequence of small geometries is that the thermal resistance
(junction to case) increases which means that self heating
effects (signal induced temperature changes) can create
thermal distortions of the response of the amplifier.The amplitude of the thermal distortion for a very high speed
open loop or local feedback amplifier can be as high as 5% of
the signal amplitude, a level which is unacceptable for a
precision measuring instrument. The thermal distortions appear 
as medium and low frequency changes in the gain or/and the
offset of the very high speed amplifier. These effects occur
well in the frequency band of modern operational or
transimpedance amplifiers. In addition, different types of
thermal drifts (as a result of ambient temperature changes)
will degrade the precision of such very high speed amplifiers.It is known in the art to implement various compensation
networks with fast amplifier. For example, in
US Pat. 4'132'958, a feed-beside network is proposed
comprising several adjustable filters to compensate the
thermal distortions of the amplifier. The problem is that it
requires many critical adjustments of the correcting filters,
and that a chosen specific compensation cannot take care of
global temperature drifts (See also US 4491802).Another common practice is to AC-couple the fast amplifier
and to add a DC-closed loop amplifier on its side (split path
amplifiers). The high frequency components of the signal pass
through the AC-coupled HF amplifier, while the low frequency
and DC components go through the DC amplifier. The problems
here are to ensure a good match of the dominant pole of the DC
amplifier with the low frequency cutoff of the high frequency
amplifier. This adjustment can be difficult and is subject to
drift with temperature, which results in loss of frequency
response flatness.In view of the problems of these state of the art techniques,
the goal of the present invention is to propose a solution
thereto, comprising
