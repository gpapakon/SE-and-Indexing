<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing hopper construction for a bank note processing machine 
for effectively pooling a number of bank notes transferred from a bank note 

transferring section inside the bank note processing machine in order in a dispensing 
hopper section even while dispensing bank notes to the recipient side, 

as well as for effectively dispensing bank notes one by one based on a feed-out 
signal so that bank notes are not dispensed in a superposed or chained state. 

The bank note processing machine is constructed such that bank notes (1) are 
fed one by one from the bank note transferring section (A) into the dispensing 

hopper section (2) where bank notes are pooled so that they are fed out from the 
lower part thereof to the recipient side one by one. In this bank note processing 

machine, an introduction plate (3) is mounted vertically movably at an upper 
portion of the dispensing hopper section (2) which is caused to communicate 

with the exit (a) of the bank note transferring section (A) at one end thereof so 
as to supportingly receive a bank note (1) at the lower opposite sides thereof, 

and a pressing plate (4) for pressing down a bank note (1) from above is mounted 
in such a manner as to vertically move above the introduction plate (3), the 

pressing plate (4) being able to be elastically pressed downwardly. In addition, 
in the bank note processing machine, a pay-out roller (21) is provided on a shaft 

on the bottom side (2a) of the dispensing hopper (2), the upper portion (21a) of 
the pay-out roller protruding above the bottom surface (2a), and two note-feeding 

rollers (50, 51) are vertically disposed on a shaft outwardly of the end of the 
dispensing side of the dispensing hopper (2). Moreover, a stopper (60) adapted 

to vertically move to change its upper surface (60a) to above or below the upper 
portion (21a) of the pay-out roller (21) is disposed adjacent to the pay-out roller 

(21).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the structur of a 
dispensing hopper for a bank note processing machine, for 
example a bank note changing machine, which is able to let 
out the stored bank note one by one to a dispensing side 
while storing the note. There is a prior money processing machine which can 
apply bank notes one by one from a bank note transferring 
section to a dispensing hopper which is able to let out 
the stored notes one by one from the lowest note to the 
dispensing side. As shown in Japanese Patent Publication 
No.4-4636, it is well known to the person skiled in the 
art to store bank notes, coming from a bank note 
transferring section, in a bank note strage section by 
catching them with guide boards mounted on an upper 
portion and a lower of the bank note strage section, and 
to transfer the notes being between the guide boards one 
by one to the dispensing side after lowering the guide 
boards. And it is well known to them to dispense the bank 
note, stored in the bank note strage section, by letting 
out the notes to the dispensing side with a letting-out 
roller under the bank note strage section and two note 
feeding rollers arranged in the dispensing side of the 
bank note strage section. In such construction, however, it is impossible that 
the dispensing hopper receives the bank notes from the  
 
bank note transferring section while the bank note is 
dispensing in the dispensing side. Furthermore, since the 
bank note storing capacity of the dispensing hopper is 
limited, the efficiency of processing the bank notes at 
the dispensing hopper is low. When the lowest bank note in 
the bank note storage section is let out by the letting-out 
roller, next note will be let out immediately by the 
roller after the lowest note becomes out of contact with 
the roller; therefore, often two sheets of bank note are 
let out or many notes are let out in succession, and so 
the bank note processing machine gets into impossible to 
count the note correctly and to dispense the note. To solve the above-mentioned problems, the present 
invention, the structur of dispensing hopper for the bank 
note processing machine, is devised for storing the bank 
notes efficiently in a bank note storage section and 
dispensing the note stably and correctly to the dispensing 
side. The present invention has an introducing means which 
can support the edge of the underside of the bank note and 
a pressing plate which can force down the note. The 
introducing means is provided movably in a vertical 
direction
