<ABSTRACT>
A single modular assembly (10) has two terminals (16) 
in housing cavities each with a pair of slots (46,48) 

for termination by rotary actuation to respective conductors 
of two cables (30,32), for crossconnecting or splicing the 

tip and ring lines of a customer's service line with those 
of a cable extending to the main distribution line. Each 

terminal (16) is in electrical engagement with one of the 
two active electrode leads (52,54) of a common protector 

unit (20) contained in a housing section (18) of the module. 
The protector unit (20) includes a ground electrode lead 

(50) grounded to a ground strap (70) which includes a 
contact section (72) extending from the module to be 

assuredly engaged with a ground circuit. Crossconnection of 
the tip and ring wires of service cables in the module 

simultaneously provides voltage and current surge protection 
for the circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of electrical connectors and 
more particularly to connectors for connecting pairs of 
signal wires together. In the telecommunications industry, telephone cable is 
introduced to individual telephone sites such as residences, 
mainly through use of a splice of the signal wires of the 
cable to respective house wires at a junction located 
outside or inside the house. The junction is housed within 
a protective enclosure which is mounted usually to an 
outside wall of the house. One example of an assembly of a 
splice terminal block and self-sealing enclosure therefor is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,219,302 and 5,145,388. 
Therein, a terminal block has a single-piece barrel-shaped 
terminal with connecting sections for both wires to be 
spliced, and the terminal is of the insulation piercing or 
displacement type which eliminates the need for stripping 
the insulation from the signal wire conductors. A 
dielectric housing includes an integrally molded center post 
within a tubular terminal-receiving housing section, both 
co-extending from a common base section and defining an 
annular cavity, the housing section providing wire-receiving 
openings through side walls and into the cavity aligned with 
an aperture through the center post, enabling insertion of 
wire ends during splicing. A barrel-shaped terminal and an associated lug-capped 
tubular actuator is then assembled to the housing, with the 
barrel terminal surrounding the center post within the 
cavity and having apertured insulation displacement contact 
sections which are initially aligned with the wire-receiving 
openings of the housing and center post, and the actuator 
also having profiled apertures therethrough extending 
partially around the circumference and also aligned with the 
wire-receiving openings of the housing, center post and 
terminal. The lug extends above the housing upon assembly  
 
to be accessible to tooling for rotation thereof to rotate 
the actuator and the terminal. During splicing the wire ends of both wires are 
inserted into respective openings and through the apertured 
contact sections until abutting stop surfaces of the housing 
which then holds the wire ends at two spaced locations, both 
outside and within the terminal wall; the actuator is then 
rotated through an angular distance of about a quarter turn 
in turn rotating the terminal, and the constricted edges of 
a precisely profiled slot extending from each of the 
terminal's apertures penetrate the wire insulation
