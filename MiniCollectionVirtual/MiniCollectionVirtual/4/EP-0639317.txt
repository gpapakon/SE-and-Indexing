<ABSTRACT>
A center channel loudspeaker system for use with a Dolby four channel sound system is presented. A first loudspeaker (18) is mounted at the front of an enclosure (10). Second and third loudspeakers (12, 14), each having a larger cone size than the first loudspeaker (18), and having a lower frequency range than the first loudspeaker (18), are mounted at the front of the enclosure (10) one on each side of the first loudspeaker (18), at an angle of approximately 40 degrees in the vertical plane back from the first loudspeaker (18). With this arrangement, destructive cancellation of the sound emanating from the closely spaced center channel loudspeakers is minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LOUDSPEAKER SYSTEMBACKGROUND The present invention relates to loudspeaker systems, and more particularly to a center channel loudspeaker system for a DOLBY PRO LOGIC home theater system.Briefly, the Dolby system is a stereophonic system which includes surround sound encoding based upon 4-2-4 matrix methods for four-channel recording devised in the early 1970's. The four original signals are mixed to make a two channel stereo recording which is decoded upon playback to recover an approximation of the original four channels, which are left, center, right, and surround. To produce a two-channel Dolby stereo recording, the center channel signal is added to the left and right channels as a monophonic in-phase signal. The surround channel signal is added to the left and right channel signals but as an out- of-phase signal. For playback, the total left and total right channels (L+R) are added together in a decoder to recover the center channel signal while the L-R subtraction extracts the out- of-phase surround channel signal. Logic steering circuitry is used upon decoding to increase the apparent separation of the left, center, right, and surround signal. The surround channel signal is delayed by about 20 milliseconds to prevent unwanted location of frontal sounds in the surround channel loudspeakers.The center channel provides most of the dialogue for a motion picture or a television program, and carries music and effects sounds as well. The purpose of the center channel is to insure that voices and other sounds originating from on-screen sources, will appear to come from the screen even when viewers are seated off-center. Thus, the requirements for the center loudspeaker system are different from the left and right channel loudspeakers which are concerned mainly with music and the directionality of stereophonic music. 

 The center channel loudspeaker system must be capable of generating the same acoustic output levels as the left and right loudspeakers over its operating frequency range. These output requirements demand that the center channel loudspeaker system have a minimum volume velocity capability, which translates into a minimum sound radiating area. Additionally, the center channel loudspeaker system should be located as physically close to the television screen as possible to maintain the fusion of the visual and auditory images. The most practical location to locate the center channel loudspeaker system in a typical living room is either on top of or underneath the television receiver. This

CLAIMS:
1. A loudspeaker system (10) for the center channel of a Dolby four channel sound system, comprising: a first loudspeaker (18) mounted on the front of an enclosure, a second loudspeaker (12,14), of a lower frequency range than the first loudspeaker (18), mounted at the front of the enclosure on one side of the first loudspeaker (18), at an angle of approximately 40 degrees in the vertical plane from the first loudspeaker (18), and a third loudspeaker (12,14), of a lower frequency range than the first loudspeaker (18), mounted at the front of the enclosure (10) on the other side of the first loudspeaker (18), at an angle of approximately 40 degrees in the vertical plane from the first loudspeaker (18).
2. A loudspeaker system (10) for a Dolby sound system, comprising: a first loudspeaker (L) including a first enclosure for providing left channel audio information, a second loudspeaker (R) including a second enclosure for providing right channel audio information, the first and second loudspeaker enclosures (L, R) being spaced apart, and a third loudspeaker enclosure (10) for providing a center audio sound channel information and disposed between the first and second loudspeaker enclosures (L, R), the third loudspeaker enclosure (10) comprising: a third loudspeaker (18) mounted on the front of the third loudspeaker enclosure(lÎ¸), a fourth loudspeaker (12,14), of a lower frequency range than the third loudspeaker (18), mounted at the front of the third loudspeaker enclosure (10) on one side of the third loudspeaker (18), at an angle of approximately 40 degrees in the vertical plane from the third loudspeaker(18), and 



 a fifth loudspeaker (12,14), of a lower frequency range than the third loudspeaker (18), mounted at the front of the third loudspeaker enclosure (10) on the other side of the third loudspeaker (18), at an angle of approximately 40 degrees in the vertical plane from the third loudspeaker (18).
3. A loudspeaker system comprising: a first loudspeaker (18) mounted on the front of an enclosure (10), a second loudspeaker (12,14), of a lower frequency range than the first loudspeaker (18), mounted at the front of the enclosure (10) on one side of the first loudspeaker (18), at an angle of approximately 40 degrees in the vertical plane from the first loudspeaker (18), and a third loudspeaker (12,14), of a lower frequency range than the first loudspeaker (18), mounted at the front of the enclosure (10) on the other side of the first loudspeaker (18), at an angle of approximately 40 degrees in the vertical plane from the first loudspeaker (18).
