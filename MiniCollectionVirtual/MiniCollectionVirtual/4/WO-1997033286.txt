<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS USEFUL IN ELECTRONIC ENCODERS HAVING A VOLTAGE LEVEL DETECTION CIRCUITBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the field of electronic encoding and decoding, and more particularly to encoders and decoders useful for transmitting and receiving secure signals for remotely controlling systems.Controlling systems and devices by remote control is becoming increasingly popular in many applications. Examples of such applications are numerous, some of the most common include security systems for buildings, security systems for vehicles, garage door and gate openers. These systems typically employ a transmitter to send an encoded signal to a receiver which decodes the signal and causes the desired operation to be performed. Of course, as these systems become more widely used, unscrupulous efforts to defeat them also increase.For example, in relatively unsophisticated systems, a single fixed code is transmitted to a receiver which has been configured to operate in response to only that particular code.However, a fixed code system is easily defeated by several methods. One method is to use a device called a code scanner which transmits all possible combinations of fixed codes. For example, in systems using eight DIP switches to select the code, there are only two hundred and fifty-six (256) possible fixed code combinations. A code scanner can typically transmit this number of combinations in less that thirty-two seconds. Even in systems using sixteen bit keys, yielding 65,536 combinations, only a little more than two hours would be required to try all possible combinations. Moreover, the scanner may gain access in far less than this maximum time, in fact, the average time would be half of the maximum time.Another way of gaining unauthorized access is to simply intercept and retransmit the signal. For example, a remote control transmitter of the type normally used in vehicle 

security and remote control systems includes a small radio transmitter that transmits a code number on a specific frequency. This code number is normally generated by an integrated circuit encoder. The transmission frequency is usually fixed by legislation within a particular country, therefore it is possible to build a receiver that can receive signals from all such transmitters. Such a receiver is used together with a circuit which records the transmissions captured by the intended receiver. Such a device is known as a code or key grabber and can be used to gain access to protected premises or to
