<ABSTRACT>
A lock system comprising an electromechanical lock and code generator, and an electronic code lock, which is connected to a code transportation medium. The electronic lock and code generator is a system, where the code medium includes both a mechanical and an electrical code, which both must be present with the correct code before the code transport transmitter can be activated. The transmission of the code takes place within a short time interval and at an individual transmission rate, and a timed blocking is built-in in case of an incorrect optical code, and a circuit counteracting voltage manipulation is built-in. The code transportation medium is electrical or optical. The electronic code lock is a system, where the correct code must be received twice successively. A built-in timed blocking of the analysis of the code is activated if an incorrect code is received, or if the code has not been received at the correct transmission rate, and an electronic circuit counteracting voltage manipulation is built-in.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic lock system 
of the type comprising a key with a key shaft having a 
specific mechanical profile symmetrical with respect to 
its longitudinal axis as well as a number of light 
passages centrered on its longitudinal axis and arranged 
in a specific code and a key operated lock cylinder arranged 
at an operation site and including a lock shell, 
a key-receiving lock core and a number of locking pins 
arranged in the lock shell and the lock core in a configuration 
matching said specific mechanical profile of 
the key shaft, the lock core being further provided with 
pairs of light signal transmitting channels opening at 
one of their ends at its central longitudinal axis, an 
electro optical arrangement being associated with said 
lock cylinder for reading said specific code, said 
arrangement including a number of light emitters and a 
corresponding number of light receivers located in the 
lock shell on one and the other side of the lock core, 
respectively, programmed code circuit means to receive 
signals representing said code from said code reading 
arrangement and generate an actuator energizing signal 
in response thereto and a lock actuator device to 
receive said energizing signal. From US Patent 4.868.559 a lock system is known 
which is primarily intended for use in connection with 
the theft proofing of motor vehicles, but may in 
addition be utilized for instance for the protection of 
rooms and offices, to which unautorhized persons are not 
to be admitted, safe deposit boxes and the like. In this prior art lock system, a flat key in 
combination with a light emitting diode and a photo 
diode for an analogue reading of the coded profile of 
the edge of the key are utilized. The light intensity  
 
received by the photo diode is in direct relation to the 
depth of the cuts in the key shaft, and the thus 
established analogue electrical signal reproduces the 
edge profile of the key shaft, when the key is inserted 
into the lock core. The electrical signal is then by 
wire sent from the lock shell to a circuit, which 
analyzes the signal, compares it to one or several 
reference signals in a memory bank, and determines 
whether the key can be accepted as valid. A drawback of this technique is that an analogue 
reading is employed, where this reading may be encumbered 
by errors caused for instance by wear, dirt, 
electrical noise, etc. In addition, there is only a 
relatively limited number of possible combinations of 
peaks and troughs in the key
