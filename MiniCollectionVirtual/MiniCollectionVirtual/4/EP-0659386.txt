<ABSTRACT>
A phantom for determining attenuation by a combination of materials 
of polychromatic X-rays comprises a number of tubes that can be 

positioned in between a source emitting said X-rays and an X-ray 
detector. The tubes are held in a position so that they are directed 

towards the position of a source of radiation.
 

In each tube a combination of thicknesses of said materials is 
provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phantom for determining 
attenuation of polychromatic X-rays by a combination of materials. When an object is positioned in a radiation beam emitted by a 
source of penetrating radiation, such as X-rays, the radiation beam 
is attenuated by the object. In case monochromatic X-radiation is absorbed by a known 
homogenous material, the relation between the attenuation T of X-rays 
by said material and the thickness D of the material is given 
by the following equation: 
T = -ln(N(E)/N0(E)) = µ(E).D,  
wherein µ(E) is the linear attenuation coefficient of the material 
and N0(E) is the number of photons of energy E before attenuation 
and N(E) is the number of photons of energy E after attenuation. If monochromatic X-radiation is successively attenuated by a 
sequence of materials, then the total attenuation by said sequence 
of materials is equal to the sum of the attenuation by the materials 
individually. This is not correct for polychromatic X-radiation. In case of 
an X-ray beam of a non-constant spectrum, the attenuation factor can 
be different in different locations of an object of a homogenous 
material as a consequence of different absorption of different wave 
lengths. In case of polychromatic irradiation the relation between 
attenuation T and material thickness D is not linear and the 
attenuation of the radiation by a number of materials is not equal 
to the sum of the attenuations by the materials individually. When the attenuation of polychromatic X-rays by a number of 
materials is to be assessed, and the spectrum of the emitted 
radiation is unknown, it is not possible to calculate said 
attenuation by a combination of materials.  
 In this case, the attenuation is determined experimentally by 
exposing a phantom to X-rays emitted by a X-radiation source and by 
detecting the attenuated radiation. In the state of the art phantoms for measurement of attenuation 
of polychromatic X-rays by a combination of materials (e.g. 2 
materials) exist. These phantoms commonly consist of a combination 
of (two) step wedges, one of each material, said wedges being 
positioned so that combinations are formed of a larger thicknesses 
of a first material combined with a smaller thicknesses of a second 
material and visa versa. This kind of wedges is not flexible and does not permit accurate 
measurement, for example because the distance towards the source of 
irradiation is not constant for every location in an element of the 
step wedge. The state of the art phantoms do
