<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to organopolysiloxanes having a silanol
group and a process of making them.Organopolysiloxanes having silanol groups at both molecular
terminals expressed by the chemical formula below, are
conventionally known:
These compounds are widely employed in many fields, for example, as
a room temperature curable liquid silicone rubber.Further, silanols expressed by the chemical formulae below are
known as compounds having one silanol group in a molecule:
(CH3)3SiOH, and
However, these silanols undergo a condensation through the
mechanism (A) shown below and, as a result, high purity
organopolysiloxanes may be obtained by distillation but only at a
disadvantageously low yield:
≡Si-OH + OH-Si≡ → ≡Si-O-Si≡ + H2OOn the other hand, an organopolysiloxane containing one silanol
group at one molecular end, expressed as below, is of interest:
This compound may be synthesized by the living polymerization of
cyclic organopolysiloxanes with silanols, as shown by the formula
below, which is described in, for example, European Patent
Specification, EP-A-0508490.
However, a complicated process is required to prepare such a
silanol terminated compound with a high precision by this method
and it also requires a high degree of technology. In addition; the
importance of compounds having one silanol group per molecule has
recently been recognized; therefore the development of methods
which enable one to prepare them easily at high purity and high
yield is strongly in demand. EP 0544 257 A2 discloses triorganosiloxydiphenylsilanols of the
following general formula

wherein C6H5 designates the phenyl radical and each of the radicals R is
individually selected from substituted and unsubstituted monovalent
hydrocarbon radicals. Said silicone compounds shall be useful as
plastizisers for silicone rubbers.It is the object of the present invention to provide alternative
organopolysiloxanes with one silanol group, said siloxanes having
improved properties such as a reduced tendency towards condensation
during preparation or isolation, and to provide a more simple and
advantageous manufacturing process for said organopolysiloxanes in
high purity and high yield. This object was solved by the 
organopolysiloxanes having a silanol group, expressed by the
formula (I) below, and the manufacturing method thereof:

wherein each of R2, R3, and R4 is
independently either a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent
hydrocarbon group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms or a siloxyl group of the
formula -OSiR5R6R7, wherein R5, R6, and R7 are
