<ABSTRACT>
An improved rolling mill comprising a roll-crossing 
device and a sleeve-roll type backup roll is 

disclosed herein, which can simultaneously control a sheet 
crown of a rolled sheet material and complex sheet configuration 

defects such as composite elongation. 
Upon rolling a sheet material S, upper and lower 
work rolls 11 having their axes disposed so as to cross 

with each other within a plane in parallel to a sheet 
surface of the sheet material to be rolled is rotationally 

driven, and roll support shafts 1 of upper and lower backup 
rolls 10 disposed similarly in a crossed arrangement are 

rotated by appropriate angles to form crown patterns 
respectively on the upper and lower work rolls 11. 
If a V-shaped crown in this crown pattern is 
insufficient, then the upper and lower work rolls 11 and 

backup rolls 10 are made to rotate further about their 
central portion in the axial direction by means of 

hydraulic cylinders 15 to make the upper and lower rolls 
further cross with each other, and by adjusting this cross 

angle, a sheet crown of the rolled sheet material S and 
sheet configuration defects such as composite elongation 

and the like are controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rolling mill
provided with a roll-crossing device as defined in the preamble
of claim 1.Fig. 8 shows a general concept of one example of
a cross-roll type rolling mill in the prior art, in which
upper and lower work rolls 11 and backup rolls 21 are made
to cross with each other by turning them in the opposite
directions to each other between the upper and lower rolls
about their central portions in the axial direction of the
rolls, and a sheet crown of a rolled material S is
controlled by adjusting this cross angle.In addition, Fig. 9 shows a backup roll in one
example of a sleeve roll type rolling mill in the prior art
in cross-section, and this backup roll 10 is composed of
a roll support shaft 1 which is provided with a central
eccentric portion 2, intermediate eccentric portions 3 and
opposite end eccentric portions 4 and is rotatable, outer
rings divided into 5 pieces along its axial direction and
respectively fitted around the respective eccentric
portions 2, 3 and 4 via rolling bearings 5 in a freely 
rotatable manner, that is, divided rolls 7, 8 and 9, and
a sleeve 6 accommodating these respective divided rolls 7,
8 and 9 and adapted to rotate jointly with the respective
divided rolls 7, 8 and 9 according to rotation of the work
rolls 11.Fig. 10 shows eccentric states of the centers C2,
C3 and C4 of the respective eccentric portions 2, 3 and 4
with respect to the axis C1 of the roll support shaft 1 and
rotation loci of the respective divided rolls 7, 8 and 9,
and crown patterns of the work roll 11 at the respective
rotation angles are as shown in Fig. 11. And, a sheet
configuration of a rolled material S is controlled by
depressing the work roll 11 with the roll support shaft 1
rotated to an appropriate angle.However, among the prior art as described above,
the heretofore known cross-roll type rolling mill shown in
Fig. 8 has a shortcoming that while a sheet crown such as
simple center elongation, end elongation or the like of a
rolled material can be controlled by gap adjustment between
the upper and lower work rolls which corresponds to a V-shaped
crown of a work roll caused by roll bending, complex
elongation in which center elongation, middle elongation,
end elongation and the like coexist cannot be controlled.Also, in the rolling mill having the sleeve roll
type backup rolls explained above with reference to Figs. 9 
to 11, there is a shortcoming that while it is possible to
control the above-described complex elongation by forming
a V-, W-, A- or M-shaped
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A rolling mill including a roll-crossing device for
making respective axes of upper and lower work rolls (11) and

upper and lower backup rolls (10) held in circumferential
contact with said work rolls cross with each other within a

plane in parallel to a rolled sheet surface;

   characterized in that said upper and/or said lower
backup roll (10) is/are constructed as a sleeve-roll type

backup roll, in which the backup roll is divided into three
or more rolls along its axial direction, said plurality of

divided rolls (2, 3, 4) are rotatably mounted as held
eccentric on one roll support shaft (1) whose rotary angle is

adjustable, and said plurality of divided rolls (2, 3, 4) are
all accommodated with one sleeve (6).
A rolling mill according to claim 1,

characterized in that said rolling mill includes drive means
for normally and reversely rotating said work rolls (11) and

making a rolled metal sheet material reciprocate between said
work rolls (11).
