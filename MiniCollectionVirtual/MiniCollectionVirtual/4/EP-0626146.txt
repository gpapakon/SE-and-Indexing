<ABSTRACT>
In a chair (1) having a backrest (4) which can be 
reclined backwardly against the action of spring means, 

the latter comprises a leaf spring (20) having its 
central portion operatively connected to the base 

structure (2) of the chair and its ends connected to 
two side arms (4a) which support the backrest (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chairs of the type 
comprising a base structure, a seat supported by the 
base structure and a backrest having a support 
structure which is pivotally mounted on the base 
structure around a transverse horizontal axis and 
movable between a relatively upright position and a 
backwardly reclined position, and torsion spring means 
biasing the backrest towards its upright position, said 
torsion spring means including a single torsion 
elongated element arranged along said articulation axis 
of the backrest support structure and having its 
central portion operatively connected to said base 
structure, and its ends connected to said backrest 
support structure. In recent years, there has been more and more 
research in order to provide chairs characterized by a 
sitting posture which is ergonomically proper and of 
maximum comfort even in the field of chairs to be used 
in public places, such as cinemas, theatres, 
auditoriums or meeting and conference rooms and the 
like. Naturally, the structure of a chair of this type 
must be necessarily simple and of low cost. Therefore, 
the designers have been compelled to seek for 
compromise solutions between the opposite needs which 
have been mentioned above, no completely satisfactory 
solution being found to date. The applicant started from considering that even a 
chair to be used in a public place must be provided, in 
a way similar to what usually happens for office 
chairs, with a tilting backrest biased elastically 
towards it upright position. A chair havinG the features indicated at the 
beginning of this description is known from EP-A 0 324 
546. However, in this known chair the elongated torsion  
 
element is a conventional torsion rod of square cross-section, 
which is secured at its center to a block 
welded to the chair seat support, so that it cannot 
rotate relative to this block. The resulting 
arrangement is bulky, heavy and difficult to be 
assembled. The two half-portions of the torsion rod 
which project from the central block are not covered by 
any housing. The object of the invention is that of providing a 
chair of the type indicated at the beginning of the 
present description which on one hand solves the above 
mentioned problems satisfactorily, so as to have a 
particularly advantageous application in the field of 
seats of chairs for public use and, on the other hand, 
is able to be used advantageously even in different 
fields, such as in the field of office chairs or house 
chairs. In view of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Chair, comprising a base structure (2), a 
seat (3) supported by the base structure (2) and a 

backrest (4) having a support structure (4a) which is 
pivotally mounted on the base structure (2) around a 

transverse horizontal axis (18) and movable between a 
relatively upright position and a backwardly reclined 

position, and torsion spring means (20) biasing the 
backrest (4) towards its upright position, said torsion 

spring means including a single torsion elongated 
element arranged along said articulation axis (18) of 

the backrest support structure (4a) and having its 
central portion operatively connected to said base 

structure, and its ends connected to said backrest 
support structure (4a),
 
   
characterized in that
 said base structure (2) 
includes a tubular cross member (13) arranged along 

said articulation axis (18) and said torsion spring 
means comprise a leaf spring (20) arranged within said 

tubular cross member (13), so that also said central 
portion of the leaf spring is free to rotate within the 

tubular cross member around said articulation axis, 
said tubular cross member having at its central portion 

at least an inner stop element (22) adapted to 
cooperate with said leaf spring (20) to limit rotation 

of the latter. 
Chair according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 said backrest support structure (4a) includes two 
side arms (4a) comprising two coaxial pins (14) which 

are rotatably mounted within the opposite ends of said 
tubular cross member (13) each said pin (14) and the 

respective end of said tubular cross member (13) being 
provided with stop means (16, 17) cooperating with each 

other to limit the angular tilting movement of said 
pins (14) with respect to the tubular cross member (13)  

 
between two end positions corresponding respectively to 

the upright position and the backwardly reclined 
position of said backrest, said arrangement being such 

that, when the backrest is in its upright position, 
each half portion of said leaf spring (20) is subject 

to a torsion load which tends to hold said backrest in 
said upright position. 
Chair according to claim 2, 
characterized in 
that
 said stop element (22) of the tubular cross member 
(13) comprises an inwardly radially defo
rmed portion 
(22) of the wall of the tubular cross member. 
Chair according to claim 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the tubular cross member (13) has at its centre 
two inwardly radially deformed portions (22), which are 

diametrically opposite to each other. 
Chair according to claim 3, 
characterized in 
that
 said stop means limiting rotation of said pins 
(14) with respect to said tubular cross member (13) 

comprises at least a transverse member (16) mounted on 
each pin (14) and having at least one end engaged 

within a circumferential slot (17) formed in said 
tubular cross member (13). 
Chair according to claim 5, 
characterized in 
that
 each of said pins (14) has an axial slot (21) 
which extends from its end surface within which there 

is received the respective end of said leaf spring 
(20).
