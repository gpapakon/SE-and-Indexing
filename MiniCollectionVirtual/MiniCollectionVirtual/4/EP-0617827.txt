<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to speech recognition and
more particularly to a method for adjusting the importance
or relative weight to be given to the scores provided by
each of a plurality of systems or comparative information
sources analyzing continuous speech. The scoring systems
or information sources are referred to herein as "experts".As is understood by those skilled in the art, the
accuracy of word recognition by an acoustic speech analyzer
can be improved by the application or utilization of
contextual knowledge. In other words, selection of a most
likely candidate from a predetermined vocabulary of word
models to match an unknown speech segment can be improved
by considering whether it is likely that a given candidate
would properly follow a previous word or words in the
sequence of speech being analyzed. Further, multiple
linguistic systems or analyses may be applied, e.g. a first
utilizing only the preceding word and another utilizing two
or three preceding words. Each of these systems in the
context of the present invention may be considered to be an
"expert". Likewise, since there are various ways of
performing acoustic analysis of input speech, there may be
more than one acoustic expert, e.g. the three so-called
codebooks utilized by the well known Sphinx recognizer
system. In general, it is conventional for each such
expert to return a score which represents the likelihood
that the unknown speech matches a given model in the 
vocabulary of the recognizer. These scores are commonly
presented as minus log probabilities.In order to combine the scores for the several expert
systems so as to arrive at an overall likelihood of match,
some estimate for determining the relative importance or
weighting for the different experts must be provided.
Often, this weighting is determined essentially
arbitrarily, based upon the system designer's experience.
If the scores were each good, independent probability
estimates, they could be combined simply by multiplication.
Typically, however, the scores are not independent but
rather are interrelated.In the case of an isolated word recognizer, statistical
methods can be applied to improve the relative weighting
provided there exists a training database containing
acoustic samples of the various individual words to be
recognized. As will be understood, however, spoken samples
generated in an isolated word context will not be most
accurate for continuous speech recognition since, in
continuous speech, there will be a substantial degree of
co-articulation or

<CLAIMS>
A method of adjusting the relative weighting
coefficients to be applied to respective scores generated in a

continuous speech recognizer which incorporates plural experts
including at least an acoustic expert and a linguistic expert, the

acoustic and linguistic experts generating respective scores for
each word postulated from the system's vocabulary; said method

comprising:

obtaining continuous speech training data utilizing the words to
be recognized in multiple word phrases;
submitting said multiple word phrases to at least one acoustic
expert thereby to determine, for each such phrase, plural multi-word

hypotheses each having a corresponding cumulative acoustic
score denoting likelihood of match;
submitting said hypotheses to at least one linguistic expert
thereby to determine for each hypothesis a corresponding

cumulative linguistic score denoting likelihood of match;
for each hypothesis, combining said acoustic and linguistic
cumulative scores using weighting coefficients initially

arbitrarily selected thereby to obtain a respective combined
hypothesis score;
for each submitted phrase, determining if any hypothesis is
correct and, if a correct hypothesis exists, computing an

objective function having a value which is variable as a function
of the difference between the combined score of the correct

hypothesis and that of at least one incorrect hypothesis; 
cumulating the objective function values over all phrases which
produced at least one correct hypothesis; and
calculating a vector direction of adjustment of said coefficients
which improves the cumulated objective function values; and
making an adjustment of said coefficients in that direction.
The method as set forth in claim 1, wherein said one
incorrect hypothesis is the hypothesis which has the best score

and is not the correct hypothesis.
The method as set forth in claim 1, wherein the
objective function corresponds to a summation over all words and

over the plural experts of the weighted scores for each word.
The method as set forth in claim 3, wherein the
cumulation of objective function values corresponds to a summation

over all test phrases of the difference between the objective
function value for the the correct hypothesis and the objective

function value for the hypothesis which has the best score and is
not the correct hypothesis.
The method as set forth in claim 4, wherein a sigmoidal
function is applied to each difference before summation.
The method as set forth in claim 5, wherein said sigmoidal
function is defined essentially as:


Sig (x) = 
1 
1 + e
-x
A method of adjusting the relative weighting
coefficients to be applied to respective scores generated in a

each word postulated from the system's vocabulary; said method

comprising:

a) submitting said multiple word phrases to at least one

plural multi-word hypotheses each having a corresponding

b) submitting said hypotheses to at least one linguistic expert

d) for each submitted phrase, determining if any hypothesis is
correct and, if a correct hypothesis exists, computing an

objective function having a value which is variable as a
function of the difference between the combined score of the 

correct hypothesis and the combined score of the hypothesis
that has the best combined score and is not the correct

hypothesis;
e) cumulating the objective function values over all
phrases which produced at least one correct

hypothesis; and
f) calculating a vector direction of adjustment of
said coefficients which improves the cumulated

objective function values;
g) making an adjustment of said coefficients in said
direction; and
repeating steps a) - g).
