<ABSTRACT>
A novel intermediate (II) for use in synthesis which is useful for the production of an amino acid derivative (I) having a 
renin-inhibiting activity, and a process for producing the derivative (I) which involves the reaction step represented by the figure, 

wherein R¹ represents lower alkyl, etc., which may be substituted by -NR⁷-CO-NR⁸R⁹ (wherein R⁷ represents hydrogen or 
lower alkyl, and R⁸ and R⁹ may be combined together with the adjacent nitrogen atom to represent an optionally substituted 

heterocyclic group), etc.; R² represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, etc., R³ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; R⁴ represents hydrogen 
or an N-protecting group; R⁵ represents hydrogen or a carboxyl-protecting group; and R¹⁰ represents lower alkyl. 

This process, proceeding via the intermediate (II), is industrially advantageous because the final product (I) can be obtained 
in a high yield from an inexpensive starting material as compared with the conventional processes and hence the production 

cost can be reduced remarkably.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel synthetic 
intermediate for preparing amino acid derivatives possessing 
renin-inhibitory activity, and to processes for preparing the 
amino acid derivatives using said synthetic intermediate. The amino acid derivative of the formula 
wherein R¹, R², R³, and R¹⁰ are as defined later, is known to 
have renin-inhibitory activity and to be useful for the 
treatment of hypertensions such as essential hypertension, renal 
hypertension, and malignant hypertention, heart failure, and 
the like. EP-A-300189 discloses the following synthetic method 
for preparing said compound. 
wherein R¹, R², R³, R⁴, and R¹⁰ are as defined later. The aforementioned method is, however, not entirely 
satisfactory as an industrial preparation method in that a 
starting material (VI) is relatively expensive and the total 
yield of the processes as a whole is as low as about 40-50%, 
thus rendering preparation cost of the object final product 
amino acid derivatives (I) considerably high. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to solve 
such problems of the conventional method by providing 
industrially advantageous processes for preparing the amino 
acid derivatives (I) at high yields from a less expensive 
starting material. Another object of the present invention is to provide an 
intermediate for the preparation of the amino acid derivatives 
(I), which is synthesized from a less expensive starting 
material.  The present inventors have found that the amino acid 
derivatives (I) can be obtained at high yields from a less 
expensive starting material via a compound (II) which is a 
novel intermediate to be mentioned later, and completed the 
present invention. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a compound 
(II) of the formula 
wherein
