<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rectangular battery according to 
the preamble of claim 1. The rectangular battery employed in such a device as a video 
camera has a structure in which cathode plates 101 and anode 
plates 102 are packed with separators 103 and alternately 
superposed, as shown in Fig.1 or has a structure according to Fig. 2 of US-PS-4,215,186. The first mentioned layered product formed by these cathode plates 101, 
anode plates 102 and separators 103 is inserted into a 
rectangular battery casing having one side open, and then a 
liquid electrolyte is filled therein, to serve as a battery as 
a whole. The cathode plate 101 is formed of a thin aluminum foil 
having both sides coated with a mixed cathode agent containing 
lithium. On the other hand, the anode plate 102 is formed of a 
thin copper film having both sides coated with a mixed anode 
agent containing carbon. It is a conventional practice to sandwich the plural cathode 
plates 101 or anode plates 102 arrayed at predetermined 
intervals, with the pair of separators 103 in the direction of 
the thickness of the plates, as shown in Fig.2, and then to bond 
portions between the electrode plates by heat melting so as to 
pack the plates. Fig.2 shows only the case in which the cathode  
 
plates 101 are packed. The heat melting is carried out by pressing with a 
temperature-controlled heater block. The packed electrode plates 
are separated at the fusing portions, as shown in Fig.3, and the 
cathode plates 101 and the anode plates 102 are alternately 
superposed, as shown in Fig.1. However, since the separator 103 is excessively melted by 
heat propagation due to the heater block which presses the 
separator 103, the fusing portions need to be wider. For this 
reason, the electrode plates must be narrowed by the wider fusing 
portions, consequently reducing the battery capacity. After the heat melting, the separator 103 may be crumpled 
by its contraction due to heat. This may conceivably cause 
deterioration in performance of the battery. Also, as a cutter 
is used to separate the electrode plates at the fusing portions, 
the fusing portion must be positioned correctly for each of the 
electrode plates. This raises a considerable problem in 
productivity. Document US-PS-4,215,186 shows that a plurality of negative and 
positive electrodes are separated by a separator, which is an additional member. In view of the above-described status of the art, it is an 
object of the present invention to provide a rectangular battery 
in which
