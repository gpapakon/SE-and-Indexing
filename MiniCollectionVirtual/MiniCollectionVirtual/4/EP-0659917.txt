<ABSTRACT>
A heddle frame (10) has a pair of laterally 
extending slats (12) and 

a pair of end braces (14) connected to the slats to 
form a rectangular 

heddle frame. Each of the connections between the 
slats and the end braces includes an elongated opening (16) 

defined within the end of the slat. The end brace includes an 
inwardly directed extension foot (18) configured on and extending 

essentially perpendicular from the end brace and having a 
width so as to be slidable within the elongated opening of 

the slat. A releasable locking member (24) is configured to lock 
the extension foot within the slat in a locked position and 

to release the end brace from the slat in a released position, 
the locking member is disposed through the extreme outward 

edge (22) of the slat and extends into the elongated opening of 
the slat. In one embodiment, the end brace is secured directly 

to the slat by a threaded bolt (24) extending through the extreme 
outward edge of the slat. In an alternative embodiment, 

the end brace is indirectly secured to the slat by a threaded 
bolt and clamp block which is received within the slat. 

The clamp block defines a recess for receiving the inwardly 
directed extension foot of the end brace.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to high speed weaving
machines or looms, and more particularly to the heddle
frames used in such high speed weaving machines.Typically, heddle frames used in high speed weaving
looms comprise a pair of end braces configured with a pair
of laterally extending rails or slats. The connection
between the end braces and slats is critical for proper
operation of the weaving machines and has been a source of
persistent problems in the field. In the past, the end
braces have been rigidly attached to the top and bottom of
the slates. The end braces were then free to slide in a
guiding groove on a support of the weaving machine to form a
shed during weaving operations. With the advent of high
speed weaving machines, which may make as many as six
hundred or more sheds per minute, the reciprocating motion
of the heddle frame was very rapid and the inertia of the
heddle frame, owing to its weight, was very great. This
caused frequent breaking of the heddle frames, particularly
at the connection between the end braces and top and bottom
slats.Conventionally, the top and bottom slats of the heddle
frame have been made of lightweight hollow aluminum beams.
The end braces are then fitted to the hollow aluminum beams.
However, the aluminum slats or rails are subjective to a
substantial amount of bending which exerts a flexing
movement on the connection between the end braces and the
slats. This flexing action results in fatigue of the
components comprising the connection between the end braces
and the slats, thereby causing frequent failure of the
heddle frames. Several attempts have been made to provide improved
heddle frames. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,750,526
describes a quick release connection provided between the
end braces and the laterally extending cross rails. This
device utilizes a connector which is fixed within an opening
in the cross rail having means for compressively gripping a
projection which extends at a right angle from the end
brace.Another attempt to overcome the problems with
conventional heddle frames is shown in U.S. Patent No.
4,022,252. In this patent, the end brace has a metal core,
a portion of which is covered with plastic to provide
additional strength. A pair of joining pieces project from
the strengthened portion of the core of the end brace as one
body and form a tapered groove there between. These
projections extend into the hollow body of the cross rail.The end brace is anchored to the cross rails by means of a
wedge shaped member which is attached to

<CLAIMS>
A heddle frame (10) having a pair of laterally extending slats (12) and a
pair of end braces (14) connected to said slats (12) to form a generally

rectangular frame, wherein each of the connections between said slats
(12) and said end braces (14) comprises:


an elongated opening (16) defined within the end of said slats (12);
an inwardly directed extension foot (18) configured on and extending
essentially perpendicular from said end brace (14),

said extension foot (18) having a width so as to be slidable within said
elongated opening of said slat (12);
and a single releasable locking member (20, 24) operably
configured to lock said extension foot (18) within said slat (12) in a

locked position and to release said end brace (14) from said slat (12) in
a released position,

said locking member (20,24) being disposed through an outward edge (22) of
said slat (12) and extending into said elongated opening of said slat

(12), said extension foot (18) comprising a hole (26) defined therein for receiving said locking member (20, 24),

characterized in that

said extension foot (18)
further comprises an insert

(28) carried therein, and in that
said locking member (20,24) extends through said hole (26) into said
insert (28) for threaded engagement with said insert (28) and is

configured to secure said extension foot (18) within said slat (12) by
drawing said insert (28) towards said slat outward

edge (22), wherein said end brace (14) is separable from said slat (12)
by removing said securing device (20, 24).
The heddle frame as in claim 1, further comprising a drive element (30)
configured at the extreme end of said end brace (14). 
A heddle frame (10) having a pair of laterally extending slats (12) and a
