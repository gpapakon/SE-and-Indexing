<ABSTRACT>
Fax machine configured to be linked to a data transmission line (19) which it shares with a terminal (18), comprising linking means (1, 20, 40) configured to be linked, at the input, to the line (19) and to transmit, to a data processing interface (80) of the fax machine, differential signalling signals of the line (19) in order, depending on these signals, directly to link the interface (80) to the line (19), in which the linking means (1, 20, 40) include a differential amplifier (20) linked to the line (19) through two high-impedance inputs.

<CLAIMS>
Facsimile machine arranged to be connected to a data
transmission line (19) which it shares with a terminal (18),

comprising connection means (1, 20, 40) arranged to be connected,
at the input, to the line (19) and to transmit, to a data

processing interface (80) of the facsimile machine, differential
indicating signals from the line (19) in order, depending on

these signals, to connect the interface (80) directly to the line
(19), characterised by the fact that the connection means (1, 20,

40) comprise a differential amplifier (20) connected to the line
(19) by two high impedance inputs.
Facsimile machine according to Claim 1, in which the
amplifier (20) comprises at the input two line amplifiers (10,

11), whereof the outputs are connected to the two inputs of a
differential output amplifier (22) arranged to supply the

indicating signals.
Facsimile machine according to Claim 2, in which a ringing
detector (60) is provided, comprising an amplifier (63) connected

at the input to the two outputs of the line amplifiers (10, 11)
in order to supply a ringing detection signal in response to the

presence of a ringing voltage on the line (19).
Facsimile machine according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in
which two capacitors (2, 3) are provided, respectively connected

to the two line wires (19), in order to ensure, for the direct
component of the current, an insulation between the line wires

(19) and the amplifier (20).
Facsimile machine according to Claim 4, in which a direct
current supply source (70) is provided, isolated from the line

(19), in order to supply the amplifier (20).
