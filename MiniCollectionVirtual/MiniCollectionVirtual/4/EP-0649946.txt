<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control system (10) for a subatmospheric-pressure-actuable shut-off valve, intended for a subatmospheric-pressure waste-water (sewage) system, comprising a first valve (14) which can be actuated by a dynamic pressure caused by accumulated wastewater, and a chamber (56) which can be pressure-adjusted via the first valve and in which, or adjacent to which, there is adjustably arranged a valve piston (24), acted upon by a spring (71), of a second valve (20) via which, in dependence on the pressure prevailing in the chamber, a subatmospheric pressure passes to the shut-off valve in order to open the same, wherein, in the absence of dynamic pressure, the first valve closes and a pressure change which is necessary for closing the second valve takes place in the chamber.

A process for controlling a shut-off valve actuatable
by reduced pressure, for a reduced pressure waste

water system, wherein

a first valve (14) is actuated by banking-up
pressure caused by accumulated waste water,
the pressure in a chamber (56) is adjusted by
means of the first valve, in or adjacent which

chamber there is displaceably arranged a valve
piston (24), optionally acted on by a spring

member (71, 72), of a second valve (20),
reduced pressure reaches the shut-off valve via
the second valve as a function of the pressure

prevailing in the chamber, in order to open said
shut-off valve, and
the first valve closes when the banking-up
pressure is absent and a pressure change

necessary for closure of the second valve occurs
in the chamber,

characterised in that

abruptly varying forces (30, 32, 38, 74, 76) act on
the second valve (20) in such a way that, in the event

of a given pressure change in the chamber (56) or in
the region thereof, the second valve closes sharply,

in order to shut off the shut-off valve with regard to
the reduced pressure.
A process according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the chamber (56) or the region thereof is acted upon
by reduced pressure to open the second valve (20),

which reduced pressure is reduced adjustably when the
banking-up pressure acting on the first valve (14) is

absent.
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2,

characterised in that
 
in the event of a given pressure change in the

chamber (56) or in the region thereof, the second
valve (20) is switched over sharply (CLOSED/OPEN or

OPEN/CLOSED) in such a way that reduced pressure
either reaches the shut-off valve or is blocked off

therefrom.
A process according to at least one of the preceding
claims,

characterised in that

the second valve (20) is held in its position blocking
off the reduced pressure from the shut-off valve by a

force which is overcome in the presence of a banking-up
pressure only when a reduced pressure necessary for

sucking off waste water prevails.
A control arrangement (10) for a shut-off valve
actuatable by reduced pressure, for a reduced pressure

waste water system, comprising a first valve (14)
actuatable by a banking-up pressure caused by

accumulated waste water, a chamber (56) whose pressure
may be adjusted via the first valve, in or adjacent

which chamber there is displaceably arranged a valve
piston (24), optionally acted on by a spring member

(71, 72), of a second valve (20), via which reduced
pressure reaches the shut-off valve as a function of

the pressure prevailing in the chamber, in order to
open said shut-off valve, the first valve closing and

a pressure change necessary for closure of the second
valve occurring in the chamber when the banking-up

pressure is absent,

characterised in that

abruptly varying forces (30, 32, 38) act on the second
valve (20), through at least one limiter (30, 32) or a

retaining member (74, 76), in such a way that, in the
event of a given pressure change in the chamber or in 

the region thereof, the second valve closes sharply
the connection to the shut-off valve.
A control arrangement according to claim 5,

characterised in that

the at least one limiter (30, 32) or retaining member
(74, 76) acts in such a way on the second valve (20)

that opening of the second valve proceeds only in the
event of reduced pressure allowing conveying of the

waste water through the shut-off valve.
A control arrangement according to at least one of
preceding claims 5-6,

characterised in that

the spring member (71) acting on the valve piston (24)
of the second valve (20) is arranged in the pressure-adjustable

chamber (56) or the region thereof.
A control arrangement according to at least one of
preceding claims 5-7,

characterised in that

the valve piston (24, 70), displaceable inside the
chamber (56), of the second valve (20) is held by a

diaphragm (72), which is in turn sealed with respect
to the region of the chamber in which the pressure

change necessary for sharp switching over of the

second valve occurs.
A control arrangement according to at least one of
preceding claims 5-8,

characterised in that

the first and second valves (14, 20) are arranged in a
preferably cylindrical housing (12) comprising

connections (18,44) for the banking-up pressure and
the reduced pressure and a connection (42) to the

shut-off valve and in that the valve piston (24) of
the second valve (20) is guided displaceably in a 

first housing portion (28), in that in the first
housing portion (28) accommodating the valve

piston (24) in axially displaceable manner there are
arranged as limiters members (30, 32) acting radially

on the valve piston and catching therein when the
valve is closed or open or in that the diaphragm (72)

connected with the valve piston (24) of the second
valve (20) is held in a first position by means of a

magnet (74) or may be moved, in the event of the given
pressure change in the chamber (56) or the region

thereof, sharply or extensively sharply from the first
position into a second position or vice versa, wherein

in the first position the second valve (20) blocks the
reduced pressure connection to the shut-off valve and

in the second position it opens the reduced pressure
connection to the shut-off valve.
A control arrangement according to claim 9,

preceding claims 5-10,
