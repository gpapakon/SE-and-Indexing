<ABSTRACT>
A door includes a door frame (20) and two skins (10,30) made of 
moldable material and forming two faces of the door by mounting on the 

door frame (20). Each of the two skins (10,30) is shaped by vacuum 
forming to provide depressed decorative patterns. Each of the two skins 

(10,30) is attached with a backing sheet (102,302) having cut-away 
portions corresponding to the depressed decorative patterns for 

receiving the same to maintain a sufficient rigidity of the door.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a door formed with a 
rigid frame and with two skins being molded to provide the 
door with decorative patterns. My U.S. Patent No. 5,003,745, issued April 2, 1991, 
discloses a door consisting of a solid board having 
opposed depressed portions in major opposed side walls and 
two moldable sheets made of P.V.C. or A.B.S. respectively 
attached to the major side walls of the solid board and 
having depressed portions, which are embossed with decorative 
patterns, to be fitted in the depressed portions of the 
solid board. The solid board is usually 3' X 7' x 2'' in size 
and heavy in weight rendering difficulties in machining of 
the depressed portions. An object of the present invention is therefore to 
provide an improved door in which the door can be provided 
very easily with a great variety of decorative patterns, and 
in which the assembling of the door requires only a few 
operations. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide an improved door which needs no foam material for 
filling into empty spaces between opposed door skins to 
maintain an essential rigidity of the door. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide an improved door with concave major surfaces for 
securing designs or patterns shaped therein from being 
fractured. It is yet a further object of the present invention to  
 
provide an improved door which is light in weight and formed 
with concave major surfaces for labour and space savings in 
packaging. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a door which comprises a door frame made or a rigid material 
a first skin made of a moldable material and shaped with 
depressed decorative patterns, a first backing sheet preferably 
of a plywood sheet attached to a bottom side of the 
first skin and formed with cut-away portions for firmly 
receiving the depressed decorative patterns and mounted on 
the door frame, a second skin also made of a moldable material 
and shaped with decorative patterns and a second backing 
sheet attached to a bottom side of the second skin and 
formed with cut-away portions for firmly receiving the 
depressed decorative patterns and mounted on the door frame. The present invention will now be described further hereinafter, 
by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings; in 
which: 
FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing a preferred embodiment 
of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a perspective exploded view showing the different 
non-assembled parts of the

<CLAIMS>
A door having first and second faces each being 
provided with depressed decorative patterns in their 

surface, comprising: 
a door frame 20 made of a rigid material; 

a first face means mounting on the door frame and having 
a first skin 10 with a first major side forming the 

first face of the door and made of a moldable material 
which is shaped by vacuum forming to produce the 

depressed decorative patterns, and a first backing sheet 
102 attached to a major side opposite to the first major 

side of the first skin and having reception portions 103 
corresponding to the depressed decorative patterns and 

adapted for firmly receiving the depressed decorative 
patterns; and 

a second face means mounting on the door frame and 
having a second skin 30 with a first major side forming 

the second face of the door and made of a moldable 
material which is shaped by vacuum forming to produce 

the depressed decorative patterns, and a second backing 
sheet 302 attached to a major side opposite to the first 

major side of the second skin and having reception 
portions 303 corresponding to the depressed decorative 

patterns and adapted for firmly receiving the decorative 
patterns.
