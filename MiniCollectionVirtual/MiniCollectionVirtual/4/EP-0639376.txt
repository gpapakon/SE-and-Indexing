<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is an aqueous liquid 
composition comprising an anti-allergic amide derivative 

of which the solubility has been increased by the presence 
of a nonionic surfactant and a pH adjusting agent so that 

the composition has a pH of from 4 to 5. Solubility of 
the amide is further increased if the amount of surfactant 

is at least 10 times that of the amide and its stability 
is improved if the amount of surfactant is 0.1 W/V % or 

more. The composition finds use as eye or nose drops in 
the treatment of allergic conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous liquid 
composition having a particular amide derivative stably 
dissolved therein. Amide derivatives described in US-A-4,795,752, are 
useful as active ingredients in anti-allergic agents. 
These are stated to be applicable to collunaria (nasal 
douches or sprays) and to eye drops for curing pollinosis 
(hay fever) etc. Those derivatives are of the formula (I): 
wherein R¹ represents a lower alkoxyl group or a lower 
alkoxycarbonyloxy group, R² represents a lower 
alkoxycarbonyloxy group, R³ represents a hydrogen atom, m 
represents an integer of 1 or 2, in which lower is defined 
as having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and Y represents a group 
represented by the formula (II):  wherein p represents an integer of from 2 to 4. Where the amide derivatives are to be administered 
to patients suffering from allergic rhinitis or allergic 
ophthalmia as liquid collunaria or eye drops, it is said 
that the concentration of the amide derivative in the 
liquid agents must be from 0.005 to 0.5 W/V %. However, the amide derivatives are virtually 
insoluble in water, and it was extremely difficult to 
prepare aqueous solutions having the necessary 
concentration of the derivative. In addition, since the 
amide derivatives are easily hydrolyzed in their aqueous 
solutions, there is a problem of how to stabilize them in 
aqueous solution. In consideration of the above-mentioned problems, 
the object of the present invention is to provide liquid 
compositions containing the amide derivatives where the 
amide derivatives are stable therein without losing their 
pharmaceutical properties.  The present inventors investigated the 
solubilities of the amide derivatives in various aqueous 
solutions by various means and, as a result, have found 
that their solubilities in aqueous solutions are 
noticeably increased when a nonionic surfactant having HLB 
of from 10 to 16, preferably from 13 to 16 is added 
thereto as a solubilizer along with an organic acid and/or 
an organic acid buffer while the pH value of the solutions 
is adjusted to within the range of from 4.0 to 5.0. In 
order to sufficiently dissolve the amide derivatives in 
the weight of the nonionic surfactant to be added thereto 
should be 10 times or more than the weight of the amide 
derivative therein. In order to obtain stable liquid 
compositions containing the amide derivatives where the 
hydrolysis of the amide derivatives is inhibited by the 
protective effect of micelles formed therein, the amount 
of the nonionic
