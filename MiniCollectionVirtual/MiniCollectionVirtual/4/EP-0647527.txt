<ABSTRACT>
An air communicating hole (2) and an opening (3) 
circular in cross section are formed in the wall 

portions of the housing (1) of the ink container. 
On the inner wall portion surrounding the opening 

(3) is formed an ink inductive portion which is 
shaped in the form of an almost solid circular 

cylinder. The projected end of the ink inductive 
portion is provided with a cartridge filter (6) as a 

first filter that forms a boundary with the porous 
material (5) that works as an ink holding means. 

The ink inductive portion is virtually solid as a 
whole and has at least one fine hole (7) formed in 

the solid portion (4) in such a way that it extends 
longitudinally to communicate the opening (3) to the 

interior of the housing (1) where the porous 
material (5) is installed. At the end of the solid 

portion (4) of the ink inductive portion is formed a 
recess as a bubble removing means that removes 

air bubbles from ink being supplied to the ink jet 
recording head by retaining the bubbles in the 

recess (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink
container for connection with a
recording head, to an ink jet cartridge having such
an ink container, and to an ink jet recording
apparatus capable of mounting such a cartridge.
More particularly, the present invention relates to
an ink container having a recording head connecting
portion capable of preventing ink from leaking out,
an ink jet cartridge having such an ink container,
and an ink jet recording apparatus that can mount
such a cartridge.Japanese Patent Application Publication No.
41351/1991 proposes an ink jet cartridge that
consists of an ink jet recording head that ejects
ink droplets (hereinafter referred to simply as a
recording head) and an ink container that supplies
ink to the recording head, both components being
integrally formed in one piece. The ink container
for such an ink jet cartridge generally has
installed compressed therein a porous material
absorbed with ink. An ink supply port of the ink
container is connected to an ink inducing port of
the recording head. The ink absorbed in the porous
material held in the ink container is led through a
common liquid chamber of the recording head to a 
plurality of ink ejection nozzles, from which the
ink is ejected. The ink contained in the ink
container is led to the recording head by capillary
action according to the amount of ink used by the
recording head.In such an ink jet cartridge, however, because
an energy generating section incorporated in the
recording head that produces energy for discharging
ink droplets is formed integral with the ink
container that supplies ink to the recording head,
when ink in the ink container is run out, the
recording head that is still usable has to be
replaced along with the empty container. To use the
recording head for as long a period as possible
necessitates increasing the capacity of the ink
container. These is the factor standing in the way
for reducing the overall size of the ink jet
cartridge.As a means to solve this problem, Japanese
Patent Application Laying-Open No. 3958/1988
proposes a construction, in which the recording head
and the ink container can be connected to and
disconnected from each other on a carriage of the
ink jet recording apparatus (hereinafter referred to
simply as a recording apparatus). This on-carriage
head-container separation type allows the full use
of the recording head to the end of its life by
repeatedly exchanging only the ink container, making
it possible for a single recording head to print a
large number of

<CLAIMS>
An ink container for connection with a recording head,
comprising:


a housing (1) accommodating a means to hold ink (5); and
an ink supply means (3, 4, 7) provided in a part of the
housing (1) to supply ink held in the ink holding means (5) to

an ink jet recording head,

wherein the ink supply means (3, 4, 7) includes an opening (3)
penetrating through a wall portion of the housing (1) and an ink

inductive portion provided between the opening (3) and the ink
holding means (5), the inductive portion including a solid

portion (4) projecting from the wall portion of the housing (1)
near the opening (3) toward the ink holding means (5), and at

least one hole provided in the solid portion (4) to communicate
the opening (3) with the interior of the housing (1),
characterized in that
 said at least one hole is at least one
fine h
ole (7), wherein in a disconnected state of the ink
container a continuous surface is formed between an inner

surface of the opening (3) and an inner surface of the at least
one fine hole (7) so that ink adhering in the inner surface of

the opening (3) and/or of the at least one fine hole (7) is
easily moved along said continuous surface to return into the

housing (1) by capillary attraction of said at least one fine
hole (7).
