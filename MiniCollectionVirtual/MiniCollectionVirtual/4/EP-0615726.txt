<ABSTRACT>
In a surgical needle (2), the surface of the puncture tip (6) 
and of the zone (8'') of the needle (2) adjoining same up to ca. 

50% of the needle length and/or the surface of the rear section 
(10'') of the needle (2) which can account for up to ca. 50% of 

the needle length, up to the thread attachment (12), is matt-finished 
or coloured, continuously or with small breaks, by 

chemical or electrolytic means or by a covering. The surface of 
the remaining section (14) of the needle (2) consists of bare or 

untreated metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a surgical needle with a suture
material or thread secured to the end opposite the puncture tip.Such surgical needles are generally known and in most cases
consist of a corrosion-resistant metal, preferably of chrome-nickel
steel. With such needles, whose whole length is bare or
has not been surface-treated, precise establishment of the
puncture point and estimation of the puncture depth is
frequently not unproblematical during an operation. In
addition, when pulling out the needle after the tissue has been
pierced, determination of how much further the needle must still
be pulled until its rear section with the thread attachment has
also emerged from the tissue is in many cases possible only with
difficulty.Known from U.S. Patent No. 3 840 015 is a surgical needle whose
tip is provided with a photoluminescent covering which, when
irradiated by a suitable source, is excited to light up.
Otherwise the needle is bare or untreated at the surface. The
photoluminescent covering improves the visibility of the needle
tip, which is a help in establishing the puncture point and
greatly facilitates the use of the needle. A disadvantage is
that an additional radiation source is necessary to cause the
photoluminescent covering to light up. Moreover, such a
covering is not unproblematical in terms of its toxicity. The object of the invention is to provide a surgical needle
which can be handled more easily and which makes more precise
operation possible.This object is achieved by a surgical needle with the features
of claim 1 and by a surgical needle with the features of claim
2. Advantageous versions result from the dependent claims.With the inventive surgical needle, the
surface of the puncture tip and of the zone of the needle
adjoining same is coloured, continuously or
with small breaks, by chemical or electrolytic means or by a
covering, for up to ca. 50% of the needle length, while the
surface of the remaining section of the needle up to the thread
attachment consists of bare or untreated metal. As a result of
the surface treatment, the zone of the puncture tip stands in
clear contrast to the rest of the needle, which can be of great
help to the surgeon in the precise establishment of the puncture
point. Surprisingly, it turns out that a suture can also be
created very precisely with such a needle according to the
invention, which differs from the existing view that the needle
zone which is to be emphasized must reflect light strongly or
even light up itself. The surgical needle

<CLAIMS>
Surgical needle with a suture material or thread (4)
secured to the end opposite the puncture tip (6), wherein

the surface of the puncture tip (6) and of the zone (8) of
the needle (2) adjoining same is surface-treated, while the

surface of the remaining section (10) of the needle up to
the thread attachment (12) consists of bare or untreated

metal, characterized in that the surface of the puncture
tip (6) and of the zone (8) of the needle (2) adjoining

same is coloured, continuously or with small breaks, by
chemical or electrolytic means or by a covering, and

without being photoluminescent, for up to ca. 50% of the
needle length.
Surgical needle with a suture material or thread (4)
secured to the end opposite the puncture tip (6), wherein

the surface of the puncture tip (6) and of the zone (8'') of

the needle (2) adjoining same is surface-treated,
characterized in that the surface of the puncture tip (6)

and of the zone (8'') of the needle (2) adjoining same up to
ca. 50% of the needle length as well as the surface of the

rear section (10'') of the needle (2) which can account for
up to ca. 50% of the needle length, up to the thread

attachment (12), is coloured, continuously or with small
breaks, by chemical or electrolytic means or by a covering,

and without being photoluminescent, while in the middle
section (14) of the needle (2) the surface consists of bare

or untreated metal.
Surgical needle according to claim 1, characterized in that
the zone (8) of the needle (2) whose surface is coloured,

continuously or with small breaks, by chemical or
electrolytic means or by a covering, and without being 

photoluminescent, accounts for less than 25% of the needle
length.
Surgical needle according to claim 2, characterized in that
the middle section (14) of the needle (2) whose surface

consists of bare or untreated metal accounts for at least
50% of the needle length.
Surgical needle according to one of the previous claims,
characterized in that the coloured zone or zones of the

needle are coloured in annular form (8'') or in speckled
form, the surface between the rings or speckles being bare

or untreated.
