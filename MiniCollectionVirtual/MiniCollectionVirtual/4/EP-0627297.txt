An arrangement for positioning a container or a container 
preform of thermoplastic material, having a neck (1) 

provided with a substantially circular cylindrical inside 
wall (2), in a predetermined angular position on a mandrel 

(11) inserted into said neck (1), 

characterized in that a surface selected from the inside 
wall (2) of the neck (1) or the outside wall (13) of the 

mandrel comprises at least one approximately radial projection 
(8), and in that a surface respectively selected from 

the outside wall (13) of the mandrel (11) or the inside wall 
(2) of the neck (1) comprises at least one thrust shoulder 

(14) facing respectively towards the free end of the mandrel 
or of the neck for the purpose of guiding said projection, 

said shoulder (14) extending on the wall while being 
inclined relative to the axis of the mandrel or of the neck, 

respectively, locking means being further provided to stop 
relative movement of the mandrel and of the neck when said 

neck is disposed in a predetermined angular orientation 
relative to the mandrel. 
An arrangement according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the inside wall (2) of the neck (1) includes at least 

one approximately radial projection (8) and in that the 
outside wall (13) of the mandrel (11) includes at least one 

thrust shoulder (14) facing towards the free end of the  
 

mandrel for the purpose of guiding said radial projection of 
the neck, said shoulder (14) extending on the outside wall 

(13) of the mandrel while being inclined relative to the 
axis (A) of the mandrel. 
An arrangement according to claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the locking means are axial locking means provided 

on the outside wall of the mandrel and are suitable for 
receiving in abutment the free end of the neck when the 

mandrel is inserted in the neck. 
An arrangement according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the axial locking means of the mandrel are further 

arranged to receive the free edge of the neck in sealed 
axial abutment.
