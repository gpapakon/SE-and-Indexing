Elastic mounting with a spring element (1) made of a 
rubber material for fixture of exhaust systems to the 

supporting structure of vehicles, wherein the spring 
element (1) takes the form of a disc-shaped solid body 

with assembly holes (3, 4) for accommodation of the 
fixing elements, characterised in that the spring element 

(1) is made of a closed-cell foamed rubber material. 
Mounting according to claim 1, characterised in that 
an ethylene-propylene-diene-terpolymer (EPDM) with a 

volumetric density of between 300 kg/m
3
 and 1000 kg/m
3
 is 
used as the rubber material. 
Mounting according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the spring element (1) is inserted in a loss-preventing 

retainer (2) at least partially surrounding 
the spring element (1). 
Mounting according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the loss-preventing retainer (2) is a high-tensile, 

flexurally elastic supporting band surrounding the spring 
element (1) circumferentially. 
Mounting according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the loss-preventing retainer (3) takes the form of a 

rigid supporting plate and can be screwed to the 
supporting structure.
