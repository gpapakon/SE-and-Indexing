<ABSTRACT>
A pair of links hangingly support a bearing plate which secures a 
winding shaft (3) of a shutter curtain. The dimension accommodating the 

links can be minimized. A first link is pivoted at one end to one end of 
the bearing plate, adjacent to a shutter guide (5), and at the base end 

swingably to a portion close to the body so as to project upward away 
from the shutter guide (5). A second link is pivoted at one end to the 

other end of the bearing plate, away from the shutter guide (5), 
and at the base end swingably to a portion 

close to the body so that the second link extends under the winding 
shaft (3) toward the shutter guide (5) such as to bypass the winding 

shaft (3). Thus, both the first and second links can be accommodated 
within the diameter of the winding wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for moving a 
winding shaft in a shutter used for a building in which the 
winding shaft can be automatically moved in accordance with 
the winding diameter varying depending on the winding and 
unwinding of the shutter curtain. In general, the winding diameter of the winding shaft 
varies in accordance with the winding and unwinding of the 
shutter curtain. Conventionally, since the winding shaft is 
attached to a portion adjacent to the body (hereinafter 
referred to as the body side), the movement of pulling out 
the shutter curtain from the winding shaft to the shutter 
guide is shifted as the winding diameter varies. In 
particular, when the shutter curtain approaches the closed 
state in which the winding diameter becomes smaller, the 
shutter curtain abuts against the shutter guide with impact, 
thus producing a nuisance such as a loud noise, damaging of 
slats, peeling-off of the paint, and accelerating the wear 
of a sound-deadening member, or the like, and further 
causing the shutter curtain to become rusty and its life to 
be shortened. In order to overcome the above drawbacks, the applicant 
of the present invention has disclosed a shutter in which  
 
the winding shaft moves in accordance with the winding 
diameter in Application No. 63-124423 (Japanese Utility 
Model Laid-Open No. 2-45293). Such a shutter is simply 
constructed such that a bearing plate pivoting the winding 
shaft is supported by a pair of links. With such a simple 
construction, in accordance with the change of the winding 
diameter, a quick response can be made to the winding shaft 
so as to move reliably, thereby solving the problems 
inherent in a conventional shaft secured to the body side. 
However, since it is constructed such that the pair of links 
extend upward through the outer circumference of the winding 
wheel, as shown in Fig. 8, a space for arranging the links 
must be ensured between the right and left ends of the 
winding wheel 4 and a side wall 2b secured to the body for 
swingably supporting the links 18b, thus enlarging the 
dimension accommodating the links 18b. This prevents the 
shutter case from being downsized, and the resulting shutter 
case is not suitable where space is limited. Accordingly, in view of the foregoing background, an 
object of the present invention is to provide a device for 
moving a winding shaft in a shutter used for a building, 
totally free from the above drawbacks. In order to achieve the above object, the present 
invention
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for moving a winding shaft (3) in a shutter 
used for a building,
 
   said device comprising an elongate bearing plate (7) having a first and a second end and 

integrally supporting said winding shaft (3), and 
linking means including first and second links attached 

at both ends of said bearing plate (7) for swinging said 
bearing plate (7) forward and backward to allow said 

winding shaft to be moved in dependence on the winding 
diameter of the shutter,
 
   characterised in that a first end of said first link 

(8a) is pivotally connected to the first end of said 
bearing plate and said first link (8a) projects upwards 

and outwards to connect at a second end of said first 
link to a first base end pivot (10a) which is close to 

said building
 
and that a first end of said second link (8b)is connected 

to the second end of said bearing plate and is curved so 
as to extend down and round said winding shaft to connect 

at a second end of said second link to a second base end 
pivot (10b) which is close to said building, the 

disposition of said linking means thereby accommodating the 
links within a cross-sectional area 

of a winding drum (4). 
A device according to Claim 1 characterised by a 
protecting link (11) intervening between said second ends  

 
of both of said first and second links; and
 
   a stopper (11a, 11b) arranged on said protecting 

link for controlling the swing range of said bearing 
plate.
