<ABSTRACT>
Positive-tone and negative-tone chemically amplified 
resist compositions comprising: (a-1) a blocked resin, 

(a-2) a combination of an alkali-soluble resin and a 
dissolution controlling agents, or (a-3) a combination of 

an alkali-soluble resin and a crosslinking agent, (b) a 
photoacid generator, and (c) specific kinds of solvents. 

The both positive-tone and negative-tone resist 
compositions exhibits superior sensitivity, high 

resolution capability, and excellent storage stability, 
and can be excellently applied especially to large sized 

substrates by spincoating for producing excellently 
shaped patterns by irradiation. The compositions can be 

used with advantage as a chemically amplified resist for 
the manufacture of semiconductor devices or integrated 

circuits (ICs).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chemically amplified resist composition, and, more particularly, to a chemically
amplified resist composition suitable for super-fine works using radiations, such as ultraviolet rays, deep ultraviolet
rays, X-rays, and charged particle rays.There is an increasing demand for miniaturization of processing sizes in lithography in the fields requiring fine
works such as manufacture of semiconductor devices or integrated circuits (ICs) in order to achieve high integrity in
ICs. Technologies capable of processing fine works even of a size of 0.5 µm or smaller in a stable manner are required
in recent years. Because of this, resists used in such a technology must have capability of forming patterns with a size
smaller than 0.5 µm at a high precision. Lithographic techniques using radiations with a shorter wavelength are also
being studied.Included in such radiations are ultraviolet rays (e.g. i-line (365 nm)), deep ultraviolet rays (e.g. KrF excimer laser
(248 nm)), X-rays (e.g. synchrotron radiation), and charged particle rays (e.g. electron beam). A number of resists to
which these radiations can be applied have been proposed in recent years.Among such resists, of particular interest are those of which the rate of dissolution in a developer can be changed
by an acid produced by irradiation. This kind of resists is generally called "chemically amplified resists" (Chemically
Amplified Resists, A. A. Lamola, et al., Lithography Materials & Processing. 53-60, 34, No 8, (1991)).In the manufacture of ICs using a chemically amplified resist, a resist solution is first prepared. Typically, this resist
solution comprises (a) a resin protected by a group decomposable by an acid (hereinafter referred to as "acid-decomposable
protective group"), which is converted into an alkali-soluble resin when the acid-decomposable protective
group is decomposed (such a protected resin is more specifically defined hereinafter and referred to as "blocked resin"),
(b) a compound which generates an acid by irradiation (hereinafter referred to as "photoacid generator"), and (c) a
solvent which dissolves the blocked resin and the photoacid generator. This resist solution is then applied to a substrate
by using a spin coater or a roll coater to form a resist coating. Adequate coatability and storage stability are thus
essential characteristics for the resist solutions in order to enable sophisticated fine works to be constantly implemented.
Irradiation to the resist coating produces patterns suitable for
