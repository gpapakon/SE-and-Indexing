<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for reading
from and/or writing to optical recording media having a

scanning unit (1), which is equipped with at least two
detector units (10, 20) each having a plurality of

detector elements (11-18, 21-28), and also an
evaluation unit (2), each of the detector elements (11-18,

21-28) being connected to the evaluation unit (2)
by means of a line (31-38).
The object of the present invention is to simplify the
structure of a device of this type.
This object is achieved by virtue of the fact that
detector elements (11, 21; 12, 22, ..., 18, 28) of

different detector units (10, 20) are each connected to
the evaluation unit (2) via a single line (31; 32; ...;

38).
The device according to the invention is advantageously
a device which can read from and/or write to not only

optical recording media which correspond to a CD
standard but also those which correspond to a DVD

standard.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for reading
from and/or writing to optical recording media which
has a scanning unit with at least two detector units.Devices of this type are employed for example when
different types of optical recording media are used, to
which the respective detector unit is adapted. A device according
to the preamble of claims 1 and 10 is known from EP-A-800 168.The object of the present invention is to simplify the
structure of a device of this type.This object is achieved by means of the features
specified in independent claims; advantageous
refinements of the invention are specified in the
dependent claims.The invention provides for detector elements of
different detector units each to be connected to an
evaluation unit via a single, common line. This has the
advantage that the number of lines required between
scanning unit and evaluation unit is reduced. If the
evaluation unit has two detector units, then it is
possible to halve the number of lines required. In the
case of three or more detector units, a reduction to a
third or less is possible. A further advantage consists
in the fact that the number of connection
possibilities, the so-called pins, on detector unit and
evaluation unit is also correspondingly reduced. Since
the space requirement of an integrated circuit is often
essentially determined by the number of its connection
pins, the invention advantageously enables a size
reduction. The scanning unit has two or more detector
units in order to be able to read from and/or write to,
for example, two or more different types of optical
recording media whose optical properties differ from 
one another in such a way that it is necessary or at
least practical to read them by way of differently
designed detector units. Even in the case of a single
type of recording medium, it may be practical to use
different detector units for reading and/or writing, in
order, for example, to take account of the different
reflection properties of the optical recording medium
during the writing operation and the reading operation.
In the case of the writing operation, too, a detector
unit is required in order to be able to operate
regulating circuits, such as track or focus regulating
circuit, if appropriate also in order to check the
recording directly. The evaluation unit serves to
condition the signals received from the detector
elements, for example pre-amplification, logic
combination of individual signals or the like. The
evaluation unit either itself serves to generate error
sign
