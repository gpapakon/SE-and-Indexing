<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packages for infusible 
substances such as tea and coffee, and to methods for their 
manufacture. Tea bags are sealed soft porous bags containing tea 
leaves which are placed in cups, mugs or teapots of boiling 
water to produce a drink of tea. The bags can 
theoretically be of any shape, but are generally either 
rectangular or round. When the bags are placed in cups or 
mugs of boiling water, they are usually removed prior to 
the tea being drunk - this can also, although not 
necessarily, be the case when the bags are placed in the 
teapot. When removing the bags either from the cup, mug 
or teapot, it is quite normal to squeeze the bags into a 
relatively dry state, usually by employing a kitchen 
utensil such as a teaspoon. Removal of excess liquid from 
the tea bag, in order to prevent the tea bag from dripping 
or leaving puddles of liquid on the surface with which it 
is in contact, is most desirable in view of the strongly 
staining nature of tea. However, a problem with using such 
kitchen utensils is that it is not easy to achieve 
efficient removal of excess liquid from the tea bag, and 
frequently the tea bag will have a tendency to drip even 
after it has been squeezed. One approach to this problem 
has been to provide a string harness around the tea bag, 
the string harness being tightened about the bag after use 
to squeeze liquid from the bag. However, a disadvantage of 
such an arrangement is that the string tends to exert a  
 
very localised squeezing effect, and consequently does not 
efficiently express fluid from the bag. Moreover, the 
complexity of such string harnesses means that as a 
practical matter, it would be extremely difficult to 
produce tea bags having such harnesses efficiently and 
economically on a large scale. A modification to this approach, which is disclosed in 
US-A-3,415,656, is to provide a drawstring arranged within 
a channel extending around the peripheral margins of the 
tea bag, the two ends of the drawstring emerging from 
opposite sides of the tea bag. Pulling the ends of the 
drawstrings in opposite directions constricts the tea bag 
and causes residual liquid to be expelled. Another approach is exemplified by WO-A-9113580 which 
discloses a tea bag having a string passing through the bag 
interior. In use, the tea bag is compressed to remove 
residual liquid by sliding the bag along the string towards 
the base of the bag. In order to assist compression, and 
to prevent scalding of the user's fingers, a sliding tag 
may be

An infusion package comprising a closed bag (1) 
containing an infusible substance for infusion in a 

liquid, the bag (1) being formed from panels (2, 3) of 
porous materials sealed together at their peripheral 

margins 4; and a pair of drawstrings (5, 6); 
each drawstring extending through 

a seal between the panels (2, 3), entering the 
interior of the bag at one point (9, 13) on the 

peripheral margins (4), and extending across the 
interior of the bag to an anchoring point (10, 11) at 

or adjacent the peripheral margins (4); wherein the 
length of that portion (14, 15) of each string which 

extends across the interior of the bag between the 
said one point (9, 13) and the anchoring point (10, 

11) is greater than the distance (D1, D2) between the 
said one point (9, 13) and the anchoring point (10, 

- 11), thereby providing a length of slack string (14, 
15) within the bag (1); the arrangement being such 

that pulling each drawstring (5, 6) initially causes 
withdrawal from the bag interior of the slack string 

length disposed therein without collapsing the bag 
(1), and whereby further pulling of the drawstrings 

(5, 6) in generally opposed directions causes the bag 
(1) to collapse thereby to express liquid absorbed by 

the infusible substance during infusion. 
An infusion package according to Claim 1 wherein the 
said anchoring point (10, 11) is at a location which 

is generally opposite said one point (9, 13). 
An infusion package according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 
wherein each drawstring (5, 6) is anchored by being 

held by two sealed-together portions of the panels.  
 
An infusion package according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3 wherein the length of that portion (14, 15) of 

each string which extends across the interior of the 
bag between the said entry point (9, 13) and the 

anchoring point (10, 11) is greater than one and a 
half times the distance (D1, D2) between the said 

entry point (9, 13) and the anchoring point (10, 11). 
An infusion package according to Claim 4 wherein the 
said length (14, 15) extending across the bag interior 

is greater than one and three quarters times the said 
distance (D1, D2) between the entry point (9, 13) and 

the anchoring point (10, 11). 
An infusion package according to any one of the 
preceding Claims wherein at least 60% of the total 

length of each string (5, 6) is disposed within the 
bag interior, prior to use of the infusion package. 
An infusion package according to any one of the 
preceding Claims wherein the length of that portion of 

each string disposed externally of the infusion 
package extending from said entry point (9, 13) on the 

peripheral margin (4) prior to use of the infusion 
package, is no greater than 30% of the total length of 

the or each string. 
An infusion package according to any one of the 
preceding Claims wherein the two drawstrings (5, 6) 

are constituted by the two ends of a single continuous 
length of string. 
An infusion package according to any one of the 
preceding Claims wherein each string (5, 6) has on an 

external end thereof a tag (7). 
An infusion package according to any one of the  
 

preceding Claims wherein a single tag (7) is employed 
to link both the drawstring ends (5, 6). 
An infusion package according to Claim 10 wherein the 
said single tag (7) is provided with a point of 

weakness (8) to enable the single tag to be torn or 
divided into two separate tags during use. 
An infusion package according to any one of Claims 9 
to 11 wherein the lengths of string or drawstring 

between the tag or tags (7) and the bag (1) are 
sufficiently short, prior to use, that the tag or tags 

(7) lies closely adjacent to the peripheral margins 
(4) of the infusion package. 
An infusion package according to any one of the 
preceding Claims wherein the two drawstrings (5, 6) 

extend into the interior of the bag through the sealed 
margins (4) at spaced apart locations (9, 13) on the 

margins. 
An infusion package according to Claim 13 wherein the 
two drawstrings (5, 6) are anchored at points (10, 11) 

spaced apart along an opposed location on the 
peripheral margins (4) of the bag. 
An infusion package according to any one of Claims 13 
and 14 where the arrangement of the drawstrings is 

symmetrical about a plane of symmetry passing through 
the centre of the bag. 
An infusion package according to any one of the 
preceding Claims wherein the two drawstrings (5, 6) 

are constituted by the two ends (5, 6) of a single 
continuous length of string, and a loop of the said 

continuous length of string is held at said anchoring 
point.  

 
An infusion package according to Claim 16 wherein the 
said loop is anchored within the peripheral margin. 
An infusion package according to Claim 16 wherein the 
said loop (12) is anchored inwardly of the peripheral 

margin. 
A method of preparing the infusion package defined in 
any one of Claims 1 to 18, the method comprising 

providing two panels (2, 3) of porous material and 
positioning the panels (2, 3) in mutually confronting 

relationship, providing a pair of drawstrings (5, 6) 
and arranging the drawstrings (5, 6) such that they 

are interposed between the two confronting panels (2, 
3); and sealing the panels (2, 3) together at their 

peripheral margins (4) so as to form a porous closed 
bag (1), an infusible substance being disposed between 

the panels (2, 3) prior to the final closure of the 
bag; wherein the drawstrings are 

arranged prior to sealing the panels (2, 3) together 
such that after said sealing each drawstring (5, 6) 

extends through a seal between the panels (2, 3), 
entering the interior of the bag at one point (9, 13) 

on the peripheral margins (4) and extending across the 
interior of the bag to an anchoring point (10, 11) at 

or adjacent the peripheral margins (4); wherein the 
length of that portion (14, 15) of each string (5, 6) 

which extends across the interior of the bag between
