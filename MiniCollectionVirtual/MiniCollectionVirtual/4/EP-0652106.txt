<ABSTRACT>
A drive method for an ink ejection device that 
cancels residual pressure fluctuations using a signal drive 

power source, wherein at time (b) a positive voltage V from 
a single power source is applied to an ink chamber 4bl and 

other ink chambers 4 are connected to ground. Therefore, the 
volume of ink chamber 4b1 increases from a natural volume. 

At time (c), voltage V applied to the ink chamber 4bl is 
stopped and a positive voltage V from the single power source 

is applied to the other ink chambers 4 so that the volume in 
the ink chamber 4bl is reduced from the increased volume to 

an extent beyond the natural volume that causes an ink 
droplet to be ejected from the nozzle 12 of ink chamber 4b1. 

At timing (d), application of positive voltage V to the ink 
chambers 4c0, 4a1, 4cl, 4a2, 4b2, and 4c2 is stopped so that 

all the ink chambers revert to the natural volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drive method for
a shear-mode ink ejection device, which is a type of drop-on-demand
ink ejection device.Non-impact type printers have largely replaced impact
type printers on today's printer market and their share of
the market is increasing. Ink jet printers are one type of
non-impact printer. Ink jet printers are based on a simple
theory and can be easily produced for printing tonal images
and color images. Drop-on-demand ink jet printers eject ink
only during printing so that ink is not wasted. This
effective use of ink in combination with low running costs
have rapidly brought drop-on-demand ink jet printers into
popular use.Several drop-on-demand ink jet printers are known in
the art. Japanese Patent Application Kokoku No. SHO 53-12138
describes a Kaiser printer. Japanese Patent Application
Kokoku No. SHO-61-59914 describes a thermal jet printer.
However, these ink jet printers have problems which are
difficult to overcome. For example, the Kaiser printer is
difficult to produce in a compact size. Thermal jet printers
eject ink by applying a high temperature to the ink.
Therefore, only heat-resistance ink can be used in thermal
jet printers.Shear-mode ink jet printers, such as described in
EP-A-0278590 and upon which the precharacterising portion of
appended claim 1 is based, are a new type of ink jet printer
which overcome the above-described problems.As shown in Fig. 1, the shear-mode ink jet printer
includes a piezoelectric ceramic plate 2, a cover plate 10,
a nozzle plate 14, and a substrate 41.A plurality of grooves 3 are cut into the piezoelectric
ceramic plate 2 using, for example, a diamond plate.
Partition walls 6, which form the sides of each groove 3, are
polarized in the direction indicated by arrow 5. The grooves
3 are formed to equal depth and in parallel with each other. The depth of each groove 3 gradually decreases with
increasing proximity to the back end 15 of the piezoelectric
ceramic plate 2. Shallow grooves 7 are formed adjacent to
the end 15. Metal electrodes 8 are formed to the upper half
of both side surfaces of each groove 3 by sputtering or other
technique. Metal electrodes 9 are formed to the floor and
side surfaces of the shallow grooves 7 by sputtering or other
technique. Therefore, the metal electrodes 8 formed to
either side of a groove 3 are brought into electrical
connection by the metal electrodes 9 formed to the floor and
the side surfaces of the shallow grooves 7.The cover plate 10 is made from a material such as a
ceramic or

A method for driving an ink ejection device
comprising a piezoelectric element (2) having a plurality of

partition walls (6) dividing a plurality of ink channels (4)
and having a plurality of respective electrode pairs (8),

each respective electrode pair (8) being connected together
and provided interiorly on opposite faces of adjacent

partition walls (6), the method comprising the steps of:

(a) applying a first voltage to an electrode pair
(8) of a first ink chamber (4b1) for a first duration of

time to deform corresponding partition walls (6a1,6b1) in
opposite directions, thereby ejecting an ink droplet from a

corresponding nozzle; and

electrode pair (8) of the first ink chamber (4b1) after

elapse of the first duration of time;
