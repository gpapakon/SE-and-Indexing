<ABSTRACT>
A stain-resist for polyamide textiles comprises blends of maleic anhydride/alpha-olefin polymers with sulfonated phenol-formaldehyde condensation products. The stain-resist blends are water-soluble at low pH, even in the absence of surfactant, and are strongly substantive and more resistant to yellowing than the condensation products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polymeric stain-resist compositions. Polyamide substrates, such as nylon carpeting, upholstery fabric and 
the like, are subject to staining by a variety of agents, e.g., foods and beverages. An 
especially troublesome staining agent is FD&C Red Dye No. 40, commonly found 
in soft drink preparations. Different types of treatments have been proposed to 
deal with staining problems. One approach is to apply a composition containing a 
sulfonated phenol-formaldehyde condensation product to the substrate. However, 
sulfonated phenolformaldehyde condensation products are themselves subject to 
discoloration; commonly they turn yellow. Yellowing problems are described by W. 
H. Hemmpel in a March 19, 1932 article in America's Textiles, entitled "Reversible 
Yellowing Not Finisher's Fault". Hemmpel attributes yellowing to exposure of a 
phenol-based finish to nitrogen oxides and/or ultraviolet radiation. To deal with 
the yellowing problem, the condensation products were modified by Liss et al. in 
US-A-4,963,409 by acylation or etherification of some of the 
phenolic hydroxyls. WO-A-92 10605 
discloses and claims 
polyamide fibrous substrates treated with water-soluble or water-dispersible maleic 
anhydride/alpha-olefin polymers to make them stain resistant and methods for 
preparing them. The present invention provides a composition useful for imparting 
stain resistance to a polyamide fibrous substrate comprising 
(i) a water-soluble or water-dispersible alpha-olefin/maleic 
anhydride copolymer or a mixture of said copolymers ; and  
 (ii) a sulfonated phenol-formaldehyde condensation product, which is 
useful as a dye resist agent, a dye fixing agent, a dye reserving agent or an agent 
which improves the wet-fastness of dyeing on polyamide fibers.   The compositions of the present invention show enhanced durability 
to shampoo washing of polyamide substrates treated with the compositions. In 
addition, the invention provides stain resists which are more resistant to yellowing 
when exposed to UV light or NOx gases than are the sulfonated 
phenol/formaldehyde condensates. At least some embodiments of the invention 
seek to provide a stain-resistant composition capable of imparting good stain 
resistance together with a low propensity to yellowing and having good substantive 
properties. A further problem associated with prior art compositions is that they 
have low solubility in water at the low pH preferably used to treat textile articles 
unless surfactant is used. At
