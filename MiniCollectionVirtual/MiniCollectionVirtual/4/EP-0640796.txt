<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, a baking oven having electric heating elements (12, 13) for top and bottom heat which are arranged in the ceiling and floor region of a muffle and having a circulation fan (14) which is assigned to the muffle is proposed, in which the heating elements and the circulation fan can be switched via a single combination rotary switch. For improvement and simplification, it is proposed according to the invention   a) that the rotary switch is arranged so as to be rotatable through 360 DEG  by means of a function knob (17) and is divided into two rotary regions (19', 20'), each adjustable through 180 DEG , b) that the switching functions of the top and bottom heat are assigned to both rotary regions in the same way so that in each case in the one end position (19c, 20c) only top heat can be supplied, in the mid-position (12b, 20b) top and bottom heat can be supplied equally, and in the other end position (19a, 20a) only bottom heat can be supplied and c) that one of the two rotary regions is additionally assigned the switching function of the circulation fan (14).

An oven with electric heating elements (12, 13), arranged in the cover- 
and base region of a muffle, for the upper and lower heat and with a circulating 

air fan (14), preferably individually heated, which is associated with the muffle, 
in which the heating elements (12, 13) and the circulating air fan (14) are able 

to be switched by means of a single combination rotary switch arranged on the 
front side,
 
characterised in that 


a) the rotary switch is arranged so as to be rotatable through 360° with its 
operating crosspiece (17) and is divided into two rotation zones (19', 20') which 

are adjustable in each case through 180°, 
b) the switching functions of the upper and lower heat are associated with 
both rotation zones in the same manner, such that in each case in the one end 

position (19c, 20c) only upper heat is able to be supplied, in the central position 
(19b, 20b) equally upper and lower heat is able to be supplied and in the other 

end position, adjusted through 180°, only lower heat is able to be supplied and 
c) in addition the switching function (21) of the circulating air fan (14) with 
associated heating function is associated with one (19') of the two rotation zones 

(19', 20'). 
An oven according to Claim 1, characterised in that the energy 
distribution between upper and lower heat is set so that the switch-on times of 

the upper and lower heat heating elements (12, 13) are in a fixed relationship 
to each other, which is directly associated with the setting of the 

operating crosspiece (17). 
An oven according to Claim 1, characterised in that the energy 
distribution between upper and lower heat is achieved in that both heating 

elements (12, 13) are operated continuously with accordingly regulated output.  
 

in which the ratio of the set outputs is associated directly with the setting of the 
operating crosspiece (17). 
An oven according to Claim 1, characterised in that the energy 
distribution between upper and lower heat is set so that in the oven a 

temperature drop (22) occurs, which is directly associated with the setting of the 
operating crosspiece (17), in which the oven temperature is determined by two 

sensors (15) in each case in the lower and upper part and is regulated so that 
the average temperature (23) corresponds to the temperature set by the user. 
An oven according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the one 
rotation zone (19') extends over a downwardly open semicircle, with which a 

downwardly open fixed semicircular shutter (19) is associated, that the other 
rotation zone (20') extends over an upwardly open semicircle, with which an 

upwardly open semicircular shutter (20) is associated, and that the two 
semicircular shutters (19, 20) complement each other into a shutter ring (18). 
An oven according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
operating crosspiece (17) is adjustable continuously. 
An oven according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
operating crosspiece (17) is adjustable in discrete stages. 
An oven according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that to set a 
grilling function, upper heat is set on the operating crosspiece (17) and a grilling 

temperature is set on a temperature adjustment crosspiece (16), which grilling 
temperature has associated with it its own temperature symbol.
