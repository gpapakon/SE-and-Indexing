<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method of making sway bars made of high strength steel for stabilizing
the bodies of motor vehicles.More particularly, the present invention relates to
a method of cold forming a blank of high strength steel
into a sway bar having a predetermined geometric
configuration (i.e. shape) and grains with a preferred
orientation or texture.Sway bars are used to stabilize the body of a motor
vehicle or the like. For example, sway bars are used to
prevent side sway caused by the inertia of 
a vehicle, as in going around a curve. In order for
it to properly perform this function, it is important
that the sway bar be made out of high strength steel
having a high modulus of elasticity, i.e., stiffness.
Known sway bars are described inter alia in U.S. Patents
2961253, 3218053 and 3315952.Steel sway bars have heretofore been formed by
hot forging steel blanks into the desired shape as set out
for example in U.S. Patent No. 4365824. Hot forging
techniques are well known in the art. In typical hot
forging, the steel blank used to make the sway bar is
initially heated well above the recrystallisation
temperature of the steel to about 1100°C (2000°F) and
higher. While at this temperature, the steel blank is
forged into a sway bar. Once the final shape of the
sway bar has been obtained, the mechanical properties
of the finished sway bar are produced either by
subsequent normalizing or a quench and temper procedure,
depending on the steel being used and the final
mechanical properties desired. Hot forging a steel
blank to the final shape produces a steel having
grains with a random orientation.In addition, at the temperature reached
during hot forging, substantial scale and decarburization
of the steel may occur. Since the scale and
decarburized surfaces must be removed to obtain the
finished part, some known hot forging techniques result in the
waste of a certain amount of material and result in increased costs
due to the additional processing steps required to remove the scale. Furthermore, hot forging is costly due to the energy
consumed in heating the steel blank to the forging
temperature. The manufacturing costs grow even higher when
quench and temper steps are performed due to the increased
energy consumption during austenitizing and tempering as
well as the costs associated with having additional
processing steps.US-A-4 365 824 discloses a method of manufacturing sway bars,
but the steel used is hot formed and is neither high-strength nor
has the compositional limitations of Claim

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a sway bar for use for
stabilizing the bodies of motor vehicles from high strength

steel comprising the steps of providing a blank of high
strength steel, the steel having a yield strength of at

least 621 MPa (90,000 psi), a tensile strength of at least
827 MPa (120,000 psi), a carbon content by weight of 0.30

to 1.0% and a vanadium content by weight of at least 0.03%,
and, permanently deforming a segment of the blank at

an ambient
temperature to provide a sway bar

having a predetermined geometric configuration with at
least one bend in the segment and having strained grains

with a preferred orientation along at least the segment
whereby the yield strength and tensile strength of

the segment of the sway
bar are substantially the same or greater than the blank

without the need for an additional strengthening step.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the high
strength steel of the blank has been subjected to hot

reducing and cold drawing.
A method as claimed in either Claim 1 or Claim 2,
wherein the high strength steel comprises, by weight

percent:

manganese
0.30 to 2.5%
vanadium
0.03 to 0.35%
iron
balance.
A method as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the steel
comprises 0.50 to 0.55% carbon, 2.0 to 2.5% manganese and

0.03 to 0.15% vanadium.
A method as claimed in either Claim 3 or Claim 4,
wherein the vanadium in excess of 0.03% is at least in part

replaced by niobium, silicon or aluminium.
