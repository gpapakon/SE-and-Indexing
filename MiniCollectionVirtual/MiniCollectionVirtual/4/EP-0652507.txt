<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a circuit for squaring a binary number X of n bits x0 to xn-1, comprising three processing circuits (30) for forming the set of products xixj of the bits of the number X, where i and j vary between 0 and n-1 such that i
<
/=j. The outputs of the preprocessing circuits deliver words (L0, L1...) such that each is formed by as complete as possible a succession of products chosen from those which remain of the said set after forming the previous word, each product xi,xj of this succession being classified with a rank i+j+1 of the word if i is different from j or with a rank 2i if i=j. Adders are connected to form the sum of the words by way of square of the number X.
