<ABSTRACT>
A cable-marking clip has a U-shaped clip stirrup (3) which receives a cable and whose two stirrup limbs (4, 5) are connected in each case to a rear strip (6 and 7, respectively), which rear strips together form a clip rear part. Linked to the one rear strip (6) is a window wing which can be connected, in a latching manner, to the other rear strip, two coupling pins (16), which are fitted on the window wing (9) and project out of the window plane, in each case engaging, in a latching manner, into a coupling recess (17) constructed in the other rear strip (7). The coupling recess is designed as a perforation (17) with a circumferential, closed border (18). The border has on its one inside (19) a resilient detent tongue (20) which is inclined towards the coupling pin (16) and which engages, in the latched state, in a locking manner behind an undercut lateral latching step (21) on the coupling pin (16).
