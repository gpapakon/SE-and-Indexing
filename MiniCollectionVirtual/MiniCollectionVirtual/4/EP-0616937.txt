<ABSTRACT>
A communication passage between the end sides, facing one another, of two vehicles (1,2), in particular rail vehicles, which are coupled in an articulated fashion has a communicating surface (3) which consists of at least two elements which can be walked on and a bellows (4) which is connected to the two vehicles and forms a pipe which is enclosed on all sides. In order to achieve a particularly simple design which is favourable in terms of costs the elements (3a,3b) of the communicating surface (3) are supported on the floor section (4') of the bellows (4).

<CLAIMS>
A through-communication between the facing ends of two vehicles (1, 2) coupled in an 
articulated manner, in particular rail vehicles, having a through-communication surface 

(3) made up of at least two traversable members, and having a bellows (4) which is 
joined to both vehicles and forms a closed annular tube, characterised in that the 

members (3a, 3b) of the through-communication surface (3) are supported on the floor 
portion (4') of the bellows (4). 
A through-communication in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that each of the 
members (3a, 3b) of the through-communication surface (3) is, via two downwardly-directed 

flanges (5), in a force-transferring connection with an upwardly-projecting fold 
(4a) of the bellows (4) or with a bellows supporting frame (4b) known per se and holding 

the folds (4a) together. 
A through-communication in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
members (3a, 3b) of the through-communication surface (3) are formed from a plastics 

or aluminium section. 
A through-communication in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the members (3a, 3b) of the through-communication surface (3) overlap one another, 

the upper member (3a) having bevels (6) directed towards the adjacent lower member 
(3b).
