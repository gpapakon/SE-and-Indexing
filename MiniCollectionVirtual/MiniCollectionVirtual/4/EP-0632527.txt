<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connection module having multiple contacts for the connection of cable conductors to an insulation-piercing terminal contact, comprising a pressure piece with a screw, an intermediate piece and a baseplate. The object of the invention, which is to develop a connection module of the generic type to which cable conductors having a different wire diameter and having a wide bandwidth can optionally be connected, is achieved in that a closed fork contact 6 is integrally connected via a connecting plate 21 to the insulation-piercing terminal contact 7 and to a pick-off 18, the insulation-piercing terminal contact 7 being positioned obliquely behind the fork contact 6.

<CLAIMS>
Connection module (1) having multiple contacts
(20) for the connection of cable conductors to an

insulation-piercing terminal contact (7), comprising a
pressure piece (2) with a screw (3), an intermediate

piece (4) and a baseplate (5), characterized in that
the multiple contact (20) is a closed fork contact (6),

which has an angle of 90째 with respect to the wire axis
(22) of the cable conductor and is integrally connected

via a connecting plate (21) to an insulation-piercing
terminal contact (7) positioned obliquely with respect

to the wire axis (22) of the cable conductor and to a
pick-off (18), the contact slots (23,24) of the two

contacts (6, 7) being arranged in parallel alignment
with respect to the wire axis (22) and the contact

regions of the contacts (6, 7) lying parallel to one
another in one plane, the cable conductors with a

relatively large wire diameter being wired only to the
fork contact (6) and the cable conductors with the

relatively small wire diameter being wired to the
insulation-piercing terminal contact (7) and secured in

position by the fork contact (6).
Connection module according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the closed fork contact (6) is

arranged in a 90째 position with respect to the wire axis
(22), the insulation-piercing terminal contact (7) is

arranged such that it is positioned obliquely by 30째 and
the pick-off (18) is arranged such that it is turned

through 90째 on the connecting plate (21). 
Connection module according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the pick-off (18) has a latching

lug (15).
Connection module according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the pressure piece (2) integrated

into the intermediate piece (4) has two separate
contact chambers (11, 12) for the outgoing conductors,

and in that, on the baseplate (5) with the intermediate
piece (4) fastened releasably thereupon by means of a

latching device (13), the contacts (8) for the incoming
conductors are arranged as insulation-piercing terminal

contacts (19).
Connection module according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the contacts (20) of the incoming

conductors and the contacts (8) of the outgoing
conductors are arranged in a spatially and electrically

separable manner.
Connection module according to Claims 4 and 5,
characterized in that functional elements can be fitted

onto the contacts (8) in the baseplate (5).
Connection module according to Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the connection module (1) can be

attached by means of a latching device (14) onto
commercially available profile rails.
