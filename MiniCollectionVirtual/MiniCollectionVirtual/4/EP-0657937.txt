<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of integrated circuits, and 
more particularly to a gate array architecture having improved 
reliability and increased immunity to charged particles, photon 
energy and electromagnetic radiation for deep space applications. In the semiconductor industry, gate arrays are employed as 
customized integrated circuit devices. Implementing electrical logic 
functions, gate arrays realize AND, NAND, OR, and NOR gates, as 
well as combinations of these gate functions to form latches, flip 
flops, and adders, for example. In order to customize specific electrical logic functions on a 
semiconductor substrate, complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor ("CMOS") gate arrays typically comprise a base 
array of a plurality of P type and a plurality of N type transistors. 
Both P and N type transistors are arranged in columns, enabling 
customization by intra and inter logical connections. These 
connections allow electrical current to pass between 
interconnected transistors. Further, these connectors are usually 
formed by one or more metal mask layers. Traditionally, gate arrays are formed on a semiconductor 
substrate having drain-source diffusion regions. It should be noted 
that for the purposes of the present invention, source and drain are 
interchangeable, particularly in light of the physics of field effect 
transistor ("FET") devices. These drain-source regions are 
sufficiently spaced apart and insulated from one another to enable  
 
the formation of a gate region. As disclosed in U.S. Patent 
4,620,270, commonly assigned with the present invention and 
incorporated herein by reference, by this arrangement, a chain of 
continuously electrically connected transistors can be formed. The 
drain of each transistor of the series is thus electrically coupled to 
the source of an adjacent transistor. As such, logical functions can 
be realized by electrical coupling selected transistors from the 
chain. Once customized, industry practice is to employ some 
means to increase the level of reliability of the customized IC. As 
such, positioned between each logically realized element is an 
isolation transistor. Isolation transistors functional purpose is to 
isolate each logical element from the IC's remaining components. 
Comprising a gate, source and drain, the isolation transistor's gate 
is coupled to a voltage source or ground, depending on the 
transistor type, and thereby made inactive. Thus, for example, if 
the isolation transistor is an N type, the gate is coupled to
