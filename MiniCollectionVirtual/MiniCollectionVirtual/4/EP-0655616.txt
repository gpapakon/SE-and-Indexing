<ABSTRACT>
A prescribed threshold level Dth for misfire 
judgment for each cylinder is recorded in a misfire 

judgment level retaining means 102 of a misfire judgment 
processing section 100. A combustion state parameter 

operation means 106 measures revolution speed of a multi-cylinder 
engine for each cylinder, and attains as a 

combustion state parameter a differential in revolution 
speed between a specific cylinder and other cylinders. 

In a misfire judgment level correction means 104, a 
plurality of combustion state parameters concerning the 

specific cylinder is attained, and the above-mentioned 
threshold level Dth is corrected as a function of the 

parameter. A misfire judgment processing means 108 
compares the combustion state parameter with the 

threshold level Dth and diagnoses a combustion state in 
the specific cylinder. Namely, the corresponding 

cylinder is judged to be misfire when the combustion 
state parameter of the specific cylinder exceeds the 

prescribed parameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for and
method of diagnosing a combustion state of multi-cylinder
engine with a change of revelation speed among the
cylinders.Abnormality of combustion in the engine such as
occurrence of misfire results in atmosphere contamination
because of exhausting unburnt gases. Further, in
catalyzer, etc. provided to purify the exhaust gas, when
the unburnt gas burns, an exhaust purifying apparatus
section thereof is heated to an abnormally high
temperature, and its performance is detracted. For
preventing this, it was necessary to detect misfire
occurrence to send an driver an alarm, and to stop fuel
supply to a cylinder in which misfire was occurring.There are many prior arts concerning diagnosis
apparatus of a combustion state such as misfire. Some
examples of them are a method of detecting it with change
in revelational speed of the engine, a method of
detecting it using combustion pressure, temperature, etc.
in a combustion chamber, a method of detecting a
combustion state using a change in revelation speed among
the cylinders, etc. Of the various methods, the method
of detecting abnormality of combustion state, using a 
change in revelation speed has a characteristic that the
combustion state can be detected with a relatively small
cost increase and irrespective of their causes (even if
deterioration in combustion state is caused by
abnormality in any of fuel line, ignition line and air
line). This method, as is disclosed in JP A 2-112646 and
JP A 1-30098, detects revelation speed at a particular
crank angle for each cylinder since the rotational speed
differs between at normal combustion and at abnormal
combustion, and diagnoses the combustion state on the
basis of a change in the revelation speed among the
cylinders.Further, in order to remove a change in revelation
speed due to outer disturbance factors such as a rough
road other than engine misfire, a method of
discriminating a specific operation state in which it is
predictable that many such outer disturbances are
inputted, on the basis of information of a remaining fuel
amount, a brake switch, automobile speed, etc., and not
executing misfire detection processing during such a
specific operation period is disclosed in JP A 4-203252.
Further, a method of using information of each wheel
speed, detecting whether or not there is outer
disturbance input on the basis of signals from an
acceleration meter mounted on a car body, and stopping
misfire judgment is disclosed in JP A 4-209950, JP A 4-295161,
etc.
