<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming silicon integrated circuits is disclosed. Ion 
implantation of polysilicon gates is accomplished by directing a dopant species (21) 

at a polysilicon layer (19) at an angle instead of normal incidence. The angularly 
directed dopant species cannot channel through the polysilicon layer and, 

furthermore, the dopant species "sees" a thicker effective polysilicon layer (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of integrated circuit fabrication. Typical silicon MOSFET integrated circuits utilize gates made from 
doped polysilicon. A popular method for doping the polysilicon material employed 
in gates is ion implantation. However, in ion implantation, typically, the ions strike 
the polysilicon surface at normal incidence. There is a danger that the ions may 
traverse the polysilicon (and the underlying gate oxide) and embed themselves in the 
silicon substrate. The embedded ions adversely affect the channel of the 
subsequently-formed transistor. Designers have attempted to alleviate this problem by making the 
polysilicon layer fairly thick, for example, between 300 and 500nm (3000 and 
5000Å), depending on the implant energy. (Another approach has been to lower the 
implant energy. However, this approach causes throughput problems.) However, 
the thick polysilicon layer produces a gate stack which is undesirably high for sub-micron 
integrated circuits. The high gate stack produces an undesirably variable 
topography. Furthermore, the columnar structure of the polysilicon in the gate 
permits implantation ions to pass through even a relatively thick polysilicon layer 
and embed in the underlying substrate (thereby adversely affecting transistor 
performance). This phenomenon is often termed "channeling". Lower gate stack heights are achievable with the present invention 
which illustratively includes forming a silicon layer upon a dielectric layer upon a 
substrate. Then a dopant species is directed at the silicon layer at a non-zero angle 
from normal. Then the gate is patterned. The figure is a cross-section of drawing useful in understanding an 
illustrative embodiment of the present invention. In the figure reference numeral 11 denotes a substrate which may, 
illustratively, be silicon, doped silicon, or epitaxial silicon. In general, the term 
substrate refers to a material upon which other material layers may be deposited or 
formed. Reference numerals 13 and 15 denote a field oxide which may, for example, 
be formed by the LOCOS or poly buffered LOCOS processes.  Reference numeral 17 denotes a gate oxide layer formed over surface 23 
of substrate 11. Reference numeral 19 denotes a polysilicon layer. It is desirable to implant polysilicon layer 19 with dopant ions to reduce 
its sheet resistance and achieve a desirable work function for the transistor gate. In 
previous practice, the thickness of layer 19 was typically between 300nm (3000Å) 
and 500nm (5000Å) (to
