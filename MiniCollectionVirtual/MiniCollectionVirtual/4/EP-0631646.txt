<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a well conduit
(tubing and/or casing) cutting and milling apparatus and
method for insertion in a wellbore to cut through a tubing
or casing section and to mill out a predetermined length of
tubing or casing.In subterranean well operations, it is
occasionally necessary to cut and remove a section of a
tubing string or well casing. To this end, several
configurations of tubing or casing cutting and milling
tools have been developed for use with conventional drill
rigs which must be brought on site over the well head.
However, the cost and time consumed in using conventional
rigs is disadvantageous and there has been a significant
increase in the use of so-called coiled tubing units for
certain well operations.Basically, known prior art types of cutting and
milling tools for use with conventional drill rigs are
configured for cutting through a tubing or casing section
and then mill away a portion of that section by moving the
tool in a generally downward direction. The operation of
these types of tools has several shortcomings when
attempted to be used with coiled tubing. Control over the
axial downward pressure on the tool is usually difficult to
maintain because of the flexibility of the tubing string to
which the tool is connected. Accordingly, the cutting or
milling tool may wear prematurely and the downward pressure
may also deflect the casing or tubing being cut resulting
in failure of the tool and/or the tubing or jamming of the
tool in the casing or tubing. Known types of casing, cutting and milling tools are also not adapted to being
inserted into the casing string through smaller diameter tubing strings. Known types
of tools require removal of the tubing string from the wellbore before the tool can be
inserted and operated to cut and mill away a section of casing.Still further, known types of tools are difficult to operate when cutting and
milling tubing since, in many instances, the tubing string may be forced "off center"
with respect to the central axis of a casing or larger diameter tubing string in which
the tubing string to be cut and milled is located. An example of conventional means
for stabilising a tubular string within a casing in a wellbore is disclosed in US-A-4
776 394. In essence, the stabiliser unit consists of a plurality of circumferentially
spaced pads, pivotally connected to the body of the apparatus. The pads are moved
into a working position with the use of hydraulic pressure and the housing of the
stabiliser unit is rotatably supported on
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for effecting cutting and removal of a section of well conduit and
the like in place within a wellbore comprising:


a cutter unit (22) including a body (23) and opposed cutters (30,34) mounted
on said body and operable to be radially extended from a retracted position to a

working position for engagement with an inner wall surface of a well conduit and
for cutting through said well conduit in response to rotation of said apparatus;
a first fluid pressure operated piston (64) for moving said cutters from a
retracted position to a working position;
stabiliser arms (38) moveable between a retracted position and a working
position including surfaces (42,44) thereon for engagement with a well conduit wall

to stabilise and centralise said apparatus within said well conduit; and
a fluid pressure operated piston (84) for moving said stabiliser arms to said
working position;
characterised in that said stabiliser arms are opposed stabiliser arms and in
that said apparatus further comprises a second fluid pressure operated piston (70) for

assisting said first piston to hold said cutters in said working position.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said stabiliser arms (38)
comprise a first stabilising unit and said apparatus further comprises at least a second

stabilising unit (24), spaced apart from said first stabilising unit and comprising
opposed stabiliser arms, and wherein the opposed stabilising arms of one stabilising

unit are moveable in a plane which intersects a plane in which the opposed stabilising
arms of the other stabilising unit are moveable.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein said cutters (30,34)
comprise a pair of opposed cutter arms (30) disposed on said apparatus being

moveable from a retracted position to a working position and cutting element means
(34) on said arms, said cutters being engageable with a wall surface of said conduit

for cutting through said conduit in response to rotation of said apparatus in said conduit. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that said
cutters are pivotally mounted on said cutter unit and are interchangeable with a set

of opposed milling arms (50) which are mountable on said cutter unit (22), said
milling arms each including cutters (34) mounted thereon for milling a downwardly

facing end of said conduit so that said apparatus is operable to remove a section of
well conduit by movement in a direction generally out of said well conduit.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that said milling arms (50)
each include a plurality of cutting elements (34) mounted thereon, respectively, for

engagement with a surface of said well conduit for milling away said well conduit to
effect removal of a section thereof. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 4 or Claim 5 wherein said milling arms (50)
each include at least one radially projecting support portion (102,104) for supporting

a plurality of cutting elements (34) forming cutting surfaces for milling an end of said
well conduit.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 6 wherein said support portion (102,104) is
disposed for supporting said cutting elements (34) to cut tangentially along a

cylindrical part of said well conduit.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7 wherein said radially projecting
support portions (102,104) on said milling arms are circumferentially spaced for

supporting separate sets of cutting elements (34) for milling said conduit, said support
portions forming a space (106) therebetween for breaking chips formed by said

cutting elements (34).
Apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 8 wherein said cutting
elements (34) comprise generally cylindrical, hard metal elements supported on said

arms (30) and forming a metal cutting surface.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 9 wherein said cutting elements (34) comprise
generally cylindrical members forming a circular cutting edge (110) delimited by a

chip relieving recess (114).
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 9 or Claim 10 wherein said cutting elements 
(34) include a circumferential relief surface formed thereon and delimited by said

cutting edge.
A method for removing a section of well conduit in a wellbore comprising the
steps of:


providing apparatus including first cutting means (22) mounted thereon for
cutting a generally circular cut in a well conduit;
providing a coiled tube injection unit (21) and coilable tubing (27) connected
to said apparatus by way of a fluid motor (29);
inserting said apparatus in said well conduit on said coilable tubing and
rotating said first cutting means to form a circular cut in said well conduit to sever

one portion of well conduit from another; and
moving said apparatus in a generally upward direction by said coilable tubing
to mill away a downwardly facing end of said well conduit to remove a section of

said well conduit from said well bore.
A method as claimed in Claim 12 including the steps of:

removing said apparatus from said well conduit and replacing said first cutting
means with milling cutter means;
re-inserting said apparatus into said well bore through said well conduit until
said well apparatus exits a lower end of said well conduit; and
