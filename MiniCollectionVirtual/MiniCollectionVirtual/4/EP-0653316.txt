<ABSTRACT>
In order to move equipment or containers (1) more easily, in each case pairs of rollers (2) are attached to their base areas. A roller which can be manufactured economically and has a large supporting force of this kind consists of a section, which is connected to a base structure, of a disc whose runner-like circumferential surface (12) points towards the underlying surface and is enclosed by a hollow roller (14) in the shape of an annular disc, the inner side of which hollow roller (14) is formed by a drawn-in edge in the shape of an annular disc. The disc section (9) is secured between the outer wall and the annular disc-shaped edge of the hollow roller and is supported with its circumferential face on the inner cylindrical circumferential face of the hollow roller, the two circumferential faces having approximately identical radii of curvature.
