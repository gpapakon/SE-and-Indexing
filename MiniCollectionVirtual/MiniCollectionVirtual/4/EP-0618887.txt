<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of dense polycrystalline silicon carbide shaped articles, includes the steps: (a) heating a powder compact containing silicon carbide and alumina or a precursor thereof together with a secondary sintering assist, to an intermediate temperature for an extended dwell, and then (b) heating the product of step (a) to a higher temperature for sufficient time to produce a dense polycrystalline silicon carbide product. The secondary sintering assist comprises one or more rare earths or their precursors, for example scandia, yttria or dysprosia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of dense polycrystalline silicon carbide shaped
articles and the superior shaped articles produced by the
process. In one aspect the invention provides a new firing
cycle for the production of dense polycrystalline silicon
carbide shaped articles. In accordance with this firing
cycle, powder compacts containing silicon carbide and
alumina or a precursor thereof, together with a secondary
sintering assist, are first heated to an intermediate
temperature, as will be explained in more detail below.
After an extended dwell at the intermediate temperature,
the temperature is raised in the second stage in an
atmosphere essentially of carbon monoxide to a higher
temperature to complete the densification process.The secondary sintering assist comprises at
least one of scandium, yttrium, rare earths, zirconium,
hafnium, thorium or their oxides or other precursors. Rare
earths include the oxide of elements 57 to 71 (La, Ce, Pr,
Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu).
Preferred secondary sintering assists are yttria,
dysprosia, and ceria.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the
first stage is carried out in an inert atmosphere such as
argon, and the atmosphere is changed after the intermediate
temperature dwell, for example by purging the furnace
chamber and introducing carbon monoxide for the remainder
of the firing cycle. Shaped articles comprising of polycrystalline
silicon carbide are well known. They are characterised by
excellent physical properties such as high resistance to
thermal shock, abrasion and oxidation together with high
levels of strength and thermal conductivity. It is this
combination of properties which makes silicon carbide
materials leading candidates for engineering applications.
However, the production of satisfactory high density bodies
is fraught with difficulties.Early workers (eg Alliegro, Coffin and Tinkepaugh
J. Amer. Ceram. Soc., 39 [11] 386-89 [1956]) showed that
silicon carbide could be hot pressed to high density bodies
with the aid of sintering aids such as aluminium and iron,
and aluminium plus one of the metals zirconium, boron or
iron. It was further disclosed that for the hot pressing
of silicon carbide, magnesium additions and magnesium and
aluminium additions were ineffective, and impaired the
densification process as compared to a control sample of
silicon carbide, hot pressed under identical conditions
with no additives or additions. Lange (J. Mater.
Sci.(10[1975]314-320) disclosed the hot pressing
