<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The weather-strip seal which can be plugged into the space between a glass pane and a glazing bar is intended to be configured such that it can be inserted, with a relatively low degree of force, into the space between the glass pane (2) and the glazing bar (3) and, nevertheless, a uniform contact pressure of all the sealing lips (10, 11, 12) on the glass pane can be achieved. 2.2 In order to achieve this object, the sealing lip (12) in the vicinity of the plug-in end (20) is of a shorter design than the other sealing lips. Furthermore, the basic body (13) tapers, towards the plug-in end (20), to a narrow end strip. After mounting the weather-strip seal (9), a continuation (21) of the sealing lip (10) engages into a receiving means (30) of the glazing bar (3). The outer surface (33) of the sealing lip (10) merges into the surface (34) of the glazing bar (3) without any offset. 2.3 The weather-strip seal is used for windows, doors and for facades.

<CLAIMS>
A sealing strip and associated glass holding strip wherein the 
sealing strip can be inserted into the space between a glass pane (2) of 

a window, a door or a facade and a limb, which is towards the glass pane 
(2), of a glass holding strip (3), and comprises a main body (13) and a 

plurality of sealing lips (10, 11, 12) which extend from the main body at 
the side which is towards the glass pane (2), wherein the free 

longitudinal edge (19) of the sealing lip (12) provided at the insertion 
side is set back towards the main body (13) with respect to the free 

longitudinal edges (16, 17) of the other sealing lips (10, 11), the main 
body (13) tapers towards the insertion end (20) to an end strip, the 

boundary surfaces (14, 15) of the main body (13) between the individual 
sealing lips (10, 11, 12) are aligned with each other or are disposed 

almost in one plane, the sealing lip (10) at the side remote from the 
insertion side has an extension portion (21) which projects beyond the 

main body (13) and which delimits a receiving groove (8) for a projecting 
strip (7) of the glass holding strip (3) at one side and the taper of the 

main body (13) to the insertion end (20) starts from the receiving groove 
(8), characterised in that the rearward surface (22) of the extension 

portion (21) extends inclinedly at an angle (β) and a projection 
dimension (c) of the extension portion corresponds to the structural 

depth of a receiving means (30) of the glass holding strip (2) for the 
extension portion (21), which receiving means is delimited by the strip 

(7) and is open forwardly and upwardly, the limb (6) of the glass holding 
strip (3) supporting the sealing strip (9) extends beneath the strip (7) 

inclinedly at an acute angle (γ) towards the glass pane (2) and the 
tapering main body (13) of the sealing strip (9) is supported against 

said limb (6) and the extension portion (21) bears against the 
respectively associated surfaces (31, 32) of the receiving means (30) 

along a respective line. 
A sealing strip and associated glass holding strip according to 
claim 1 characterised in that the outside surface (33) of the sealing lip 

(10) blends stepless or almost steplessly into the surface (34) of the 
glass holding strip (3).  

 
A sealing strip and associated glass holding strip according to 
claim 2 characterised in that the support line between the extension 

portion (21) and the surface (31) of the receiving means (30) is provided 
in the region of the transition between the outside surface (33) of the 

sealing lip (10) and the surface (34) of the glass holding strip (3).
