<ABSTRACT>
To provide a packing box for lead terminal type 
semiconductor products, including insulated gate type semiconductor 

devices such as MOSFETs and IGBTs, that enables the products in the 
box to be held securely in place, that allows packing and removal of 

the products to be done easily, and which prevents gate breakdown due 
to electrostatic voltages, there is provided a packing box (3) for 

single in-line lead terminal type semiconductor devices (4), 
including insulated gate type semiconductor devices, that comprises a 

box body (3a), internal partitions (3b), and a cover (3c). A 
conductive foam or sponge (6) also used as a cushioned packing 

material is attached to the internal surface of the cover (3c), and 
the semiconductor products (4) are placed in the packing box (3) with 

their lead terminals (2) directed upwardly. In this packed state, 
the conductive foam or sponge (6) is pressed against the lead 

terminals (2) to collectively hold the semiconductor products (4) 
securely in the box (3), thereby causing short-circuiting between the 

lead terminals (2) to prevent gate break down as a result of 
electrostatic voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packing method and a 
packing box for use with lead terminal type semiconductor devices, 
including insulated gate type semiconductor devices such as MOSFETs 
and IGBTs. The gates of insulated gate semiconductor devices such as a 
MOSFETs or IGBTs may break down if electrostatic voltage is applied 
between their terminals. Therefore, the inadvertent application of 
electrostatic voltages must be prevented when such semiconductor 
products are shipped or stored. The semiconductor products, the 
structure of conventional packing boxes, and the conventional packing 
procedure are explained with reference to Figures 4 and 5 of the 
accompanying drawings. Figure 4 is an outline drawing of a single 
in-line lead terminal semiconductor device, wherein reference numeral 
1 represents a resin package incorporating insulated gate 
semiconductor elements such as MOSFETs and IGBTs alone or in 
conjunction with other electronic elements, and reference numeral 2 
indicates one of a number of lead terminals extending out from 
package 1 in a parallel coplanar array. In order to pack such semiconductor products before 
shipment, a corrugated fibreboard packing box 3 as in Figure 5 has 
been proposed. The packing box 3 comprises a box body 3a, internal 
partitions 3b, and an upper cover 3c. When semiconductor products 4 
are packed in the packing box 3, each of them is placed in a 
conductive bag 5, which shields the products from the effects of 
static electricity. The products are then placed in the box 3 with 
their lead terminals 2, which have little mechanical strength, 
directed upwardly. The cover 3c is then placed on the body 3a of the 
box 3. It has also been proposed, instead of the conductive bag 5, 
to attach a strip of a conductive material such as metal ribbon 
across the lead terminals 2 of each semiconductor product to cause 
short-circuiting, thereby protecting the semiconductor product from 
breakdown due to electrostatic voltages.  The above conventional packing method is, however, not very 
efficient because at the packing location each semiconductor product 
4 must be individually either placed in a conductive bag, or have 
other measures taken to protect against breakdown due to 
electrostatic voltages, before the products can be packed in the 
packing box 3. This method is also troublesome when the packing box 
3 is opened at the destination to remove the semiconductor products 
4, because each product 4 must be withdrawn from between the inner 
partitions 3b of
