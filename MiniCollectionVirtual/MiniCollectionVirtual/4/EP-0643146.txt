<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydrogen absorption alloy 
for use in hydrogen storage and transportation and an 
electrode material for a nickel-hydrogen storage battery, and 
a hydrogen absorption electrode for use as a negative pole of 
a nickel-hydrogen storage battery. The following four types have been proposed as hydrogen 
absorption alloys: the AB5 type, represented by LaNi5 and 
MmNi5 (Mm is a misch metal); the AB2 type, represented by 
ZrMn2 and ZrV2; the AB type, represented by TiFe and TiCo; 
and the A2B type, represented by Mg2Ni. They are used in the 
manufacture of secondary batteries, heat pumps, actuators and 
fuel tanks for hydrogen automobiles as well as in hydrogen 
storage and transportation, which use depends on the 
properties of the alloy, such as the hydrogen absorption 
temperature and plateau pressure. In the field of electronic machinery, weight reduction 
has been in great demand. A battery, which is a part of the 
machinery, is no exception, and there is also a need for  
 
small-sized storage batteries having a higher energy density. 
As an example, at present, nickel-hydrogen storage batteries, 
which have a higher energy density than that of a nickel-cadmium 
batteries, are much sought after in the market place. 
AB5 type materials, such as LaNi5 and MmNi5, which can absorb 
and desorb hydrogen electrochemically, or AB2 type hydrogen 
absorption alloys having a Laves phase structure, such as 
ZrMn2, can be used as the negative pole material of this 
nickel hydrogen storage battery. At present, MmNi5 type 
hydrogen absorption alloys, for which early activation is 
easy, is put into practical use as a negative pole material 
for nickel-hydrogen storage batteries. However, in order to 
obtain higher capacity, further efforts have been made to 
place a storage battery utilizing an AB2 type alloy, in 
particular, a hydrogen absorption alloy having a Laves phase 
comprising ZrMn2 and so on into practical use. Conventional AB2 type alloys comprising ZrMn2 and so on, 
however, have a problem in that the discharge capacity at 
high rate discharging will decrease as a result of 
deterioration due to oxygen in the air. In order to prevent 
the hydrogen absorption alloy from experiencing atmosphere-induced 
deterioration, coating the surface of pulverized 
alloys with corrosion-resistant nickel or copper has been 
suggested (Japanese Patent Publications SHO 61-64069, SHO 61-101957).  
 Further, conventional hydrogen absorption alloys have a 
low hydrogen content when absorbing hydrogen.
