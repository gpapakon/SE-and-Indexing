<ABSTRACT>
The process includes 
depositing a polyimide precursor (1), then a silane (2) and finally a 

metal (4), after patterning the polyimide (1) and silane (2). The 
sandwich is heated to completely imidize the polyimide (1), 

crosslink the silane (2) and anneal the metal (4) simultaneously. The 
excess metal (4) overlying the p
olyimide (1) between the vias (3) is 
removed by chemical mechanical polishing using the crosslinked 

silane (2) as a polish stop.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for forming metallized vias
in a polyimide layer on a substrate. The process is useful
for the fabrication of semiconductor devices. The invention
also relates to semiconductor devices having metallized
polyimide layers and a silsesquioxane layer overlying them.In the later steps of IC chip fabrication, it is common to
wire the device by creating an appropriate pattern of metallic
conductors separated by a low dielectric insulator on the
surface of the chip. The lower the dielectric constant of the
insulator, the more densely the wiring can be packed without
compromising electrical integrity. Because of its low
dielectric constant and its convenience in fabrication
processes, polyimide has become a material of choice.A process for passivating a metal surface in a metal/polyimide
structure containing a pattern of metallization is
known from US-A-5 194 928.A particularly attractive process for metallization of the
preferred polyimide dielectric would include the deposition of
the polyimide layer and patterning with a series of trenches
followed by the deposition of a suitable highly conductive
metal in the trenches to form the connections. In a
particular and advantageous application of this process, the
metal would be copper or a copper alloy and would be deposited
by evaporation or sputtering. The excess metal overlying the
polyimide between the trenches would then be removed by
chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) back to the polyimide.
(See FIGS. 1 to 4.)Unfortunately, the theoretically attractive process described
above does not work in practice. There are two problems, both
of which arise from CMP: (1) the copper is pulled out of the 
trenches by the CMP and (2) the surface of the polyimide is
badly scored by the CMP. One way around the problems is to
replace polyimide by a different dielectric such as silicon
oxide or nitride. Copper is then less prone to being pulled
out of the trench because it adheres better, and the oxide or
nitride is less prone to mechanical damage by CMP. One
drawback is that the dielectric constants of oxide and nitride
are significantly higher than that of polyimide. This
drawback could possibly be overcome by depositing a layer of
polyimide and then coating the polyimide with oxide or
nitride, but the deposition of oxide or nitride is done at
temperatures that render polyimide an unattractive substrate
because of outgassing and decomposition in the deposition
tool. Moreover, there is very high stress between a polyimide
and an oxide or

A process for producing a plurality of metallized vias
(3) in a polyimide layer (1) on a substrate (8)

comprising the steps of:

(a) applying a solution of a polyimide precursor in an
inert solvent to said substrate (8);
(b) heating, in a first heating cycle, said solution of
polyimide precursor at a combination of temperature

and pressure sufficient to volatilize said inert
solvent but insufficient to completely convert said

polyimide precursor to polyimide; and
continuing said first heating cycle for a period of

time at least sufficient to provide a layer that
does not creep or alter dimension or release gases

on further processing;
(c) applying a solution containing a
polyaminoalkylalkoxysilane (PAAS) in an inert,

nonaqueous solvent to said layer of polyimide
precursor;
(d) heating, in a second heating cycle, said solution of
a PAAS at a combination of temperature and pressure

sufficient to volatilize said inert solvent but
insufficient to completely cure said polyimide

precursor and insufficient to cleave a significant
portion of amino functions in said PAAS, and

continuing said second heating cycle for a period of
time at least sufficient to provide a silane layer

that has sufficient integrity, for patterning

and metallization in the next steps;
