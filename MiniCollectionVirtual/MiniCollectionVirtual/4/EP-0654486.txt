<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a copolymer having 
succinimide units represented by general formula (I) is 

provided which comprises reaction of a copolymer constituted 
of 40 - 60 mole % of maleic anhydride units, 60 - 40 mole % 

of olefin units, and 0 - 20 mole % of another 
copolymerizable monomer units with an amine to convert the 

maleic anhydride units to the succinimide units, wherein the 
succinimide units are formed by ring-closing imidation in a 

slurry state in a poor solvent: 

where R₁ is a hydrogen atom, or an alkyl or cycloalkyl group 
of 1 to 6 carbons. The copolymer has low yellowness and 

high transparency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a copolymer which has low yellowness and high
transparency which is useful for transparent parts such
as optical parts, automobile parts, and electric and
electronic parts.In recent years, application of transparent plastics
has been actively investigated for optical parts such as
optical lenses, and optical fibres; automobile parts such
as headlight lenses and sunroofs, and the like for
productivity and light weight of the parts. With
progress of these investigations, the requirements for
the properties of the transparent plastics are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, improvement of the
heat resistance thereof is strongly demanded.Copolymers having succinimide units have been
investigated comprehensively because of their high heat
resistance. For example, copolymerisation of methyl
methacrylate with N-aromatic-substituted maleimide is
disclosed in JP-B-43-9753, JP-A-61-141715, JP-A-61-171708,
and JP-A-62-109811; incorporation of N-aromatic-substituted
maleimide into a styrene type resin by
copolymerisation is disclosed in JP-B-47-6891, JP-A-61-76512,
and JP-A-61-276807. At higher contents of the N-aromatic-substituted
maleimide, the resins obtained by
these methods have higher 
heat resistance, but involve disadvantages of
brittleness, poor processability, discoloration, and so
forth.On the contrary, copolymers constituted of
succinimide units and olefin units are superior in heat
resistance and mechanical properties.British Patent 815821 discloses a process for
producing a succinimide copolymer by reaction of a maleic
anhydride-olefin copolymer with a methylamine. In this
process, a maleic anhydride copolymer is amidated with
methylamine in benzene, then the solvent is removed, and
the residue is heated in an oven to convert the formed
amide to an imide to obtain a pale yellow resin. The
colour tone of the polymer is said to be improved by
eliminating the remaining maleic anhydride and conducting
the reaction in an inert atmosphere.Journal of Polymer Science, Part C, No. 16, p. 387
(1967) describes an imide-forming reaction (imidation) of
maleic anhydride copolymer with an alkylamine in acetic
acid or benzene.The copolymers obtained by the above methods,
however, are not sufficient yet to meet the demand for
transparent plastics although the yellowness is somewhat
mitigated.After comprehensive studies to solve the above
problems, it was found by the inventors of the present
invention that the above problems are solved by a
succinimide
