<ABSTRACT>
A device and a method are provided for the removal 
of liquid coolant or lubricant edge beads (8) from the 

side marginal edges of a moving web (1), such as metal 
sheet or strip. The device consists of two or more 

pairs of manifolds (9), wherein the individual 
manifolds of each pair are positioned above and below 

the main surfaces of the moving web and the manifolds 
also extend beyond the side edges of the web. The 

manifolds are arranged at an angle to the side marginal 
edges of the web and compressed gas is introduced to 

the manifolds. The introduction of the compressed gas, 
such as air, through the manifolds provides vertical 

curtains (10) of compressed gas parts of which impinge on 
the surfaces of the web and thus create turbulence at 

the side marginal edge portions where the liquid edge 
bead is located. Due to the turbulence created at the 

side marginal edge areas of the moving web effective 
removal of the liquid edge bead can be accomplished.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the removal of liquid
residues from the surfaces of a moving strip or sheet.
More particularly, this invention relates to a device and
a method for the removal of adhered liquid residues, such
as coolant and/or lubricant residues, from the side
marginal edges of a continuously moving metal strip or
sheet, for example aluminum strip or sheet.When liquid residues remain on the surfaces of metal
strips and/or sheet products, these liquid residues can
detrimentally affect the surface properties of the strip
and/or sheet. For example, moisture remaining on the
surfaces can stain and ultimately oxidize the surfaces,
while lubricant residues, particularly water-based
lubricant residues, can cause discoloration, oxidation
and other undesired effects when for example the strip is
coiled or the sheet product is stacked. Apart from the
undesired appearance, liquid residues can affect the
physical properties of the products. These detrimental
effects were long recognized and there are several
systems described in the prior art which were developed
for the removal of residual liquids from moving surfaces. 
Most of these systems remove the residual liquids from
the main surfaces of strips or sheet products, i.e. the
top and bottom surfaces of these. Representative prior
art liquid removal systems designed to remove residual
liquids from moving strip and sheet surfaces are
disclosed in the following U.S. patents: 3,192,752 (Dowd
et al), 4,477,287 (Kush et al) and 4,691,549 (Adair).While removal of the residual liquid from the top
and bottom surfaces of moving strips and sheet products
is very important, no lesser importance is attached to
the removal of liquid residue or edge bead from the side
marginal edges of moving strips and sheets. If the liquid
edge bead remains on the side marginal edges of strip and
sheet products, it is transferred to the top and bottom
surfaces by deflector rolls and by capillary flow after
stacking or coiling. The removal of the liquid edge bead
is of equal importance to the removal of residual liquid
from top and bottom surfaces in preserving the quality of
the rolled products.Some prior art systems were designed to attempt to
remove the residual liquid from both the top and bottom
surfaces of strips and sheets and also the liquid edge
bead on the side marginal surface. The combination of
these two functions is shown for example in U.S.
4,400,961 where air is used to blow liquid residues off
from both the upper and lower surfaces of a moving strip 
and also from

A device for the removal of liquid edge bead (8)
from the side edges of moving webs (1), comprising manifolds

(9) arranged in substantially parallel opposing relationship
to each other respectively above and below and substantially

equidistant from and parallel to the respective surfaces of
the web, the manifolds extending beyond the side edges of the

web and being adapted to discharge compressed gas (10) onto
the respective surfaces thereof, characterised in that the

manifolds comprise two pairs of manifolds (9), opposing each
other at respective opposite sides of the web (1) so that each

pair consists of a top and a bottom manifold positioned
respectively above and below the web and at an acute angle

relative to the respective side edge of the web, the manifolds
being arranged such that the compressed gas discharged from

each manifold forms a curtain (10) which impinges
normally on the respective top or bottom surface

of the web and the gas curtain portions produced from those sections
of the manifolds (9) which extend beyond the side edges of the

web collide with each other.
A device according to claim 1, wherein the angle of
the manifolds relative to the side edges of the web is within

the range from about 10째 to about 80째.
A device according to claim 2, wherein the range
from about 40째 to about 50째.
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein
the compressed gas is air, nitrogen or an inert gas.
A device according to claim 4, wherein the
compressed gas is air.
A method for removing liquid edge bead from the side
edges of a moving web which comprises:


(a) advancing through a device according to any
preceding claim a web (1) having on its side edges liquid edge 

bead (8) resulting from contact with liquid coolant or
lubricant applied to the surface of the web;
(b) introducing compressed gas to the manifolds (9) to
produce a gas curtain (10) from each manifold, which curtains

then impinge normally on the respective top or
bottom surfaces of the web so that at least a portion (13) of

each gas curtain is deflected towards the side edges and the
deflected gas curtain portions, in combination with the gas

curtain portions (11) produced by those sections of the
manifolds which extend beyond the side edges of the moving

web, collide with each other and create turbulence at the side
marginal edges of the moving web; and
(c) using the turbulence to dislocate and remove the
liquid edge bead from the side edges of the web.
A method according to claim 6, wherein the web is
a metal sheet or strip.
A method according to claim 7, wherein the metal is
aluminum.
A method according to any of claims 6 to 8, wherein
the compressed gas is air, nitrogen or an inert gas.
A method according to claim 9, wherein the
compressed gas is air.
