<ABSTRACT>
In a high speed video editing system, source video media are reproduced (21) 
and supplied to a storage device (22) at high speed, that is at n times the normal 

transfer rate. The storage device (22) is preferably a random access medium, such as 
a disc or silicon memory. The stored source video is edited at a normal transfer rate 

to produce edited video which is also stored in the storage device at a normal transfer 
rate. The stored edited video is then transferred (26) at n times the normal transfer 

rate for high speed recording on a broadcast video medium (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to editing systems and methods. More particularly, but
not exclusively, the invention relates to editing of a video signal, such as a system for
reproducing video from several sources, editing the reproduced video and recording
the edited video signal.Broadcasting stations have conventionally edited video from several sources,
referred to as source tapes, and recorded the result, referred to as a broadcast or
commercial (CM) tape, on a video tape cassette.Fig. 1 shows an example of a known edit system. Video tape cassette 1
serving as the source tape is loaded into and reproduced by reproducing VTR 2. The
reproduced signal is processed by digital multi-effector (DME) 7. Broadcasting video
tape cassette 13 is loaded into recording VTR 8 which serves to record an output from
DME 7 on the broadcasting video tape cassette 13. If special effects capabilities are
not required, instead of the DME 7, an editor may be used and the reproducing VTR
2 and the recording VTR 8 may be combined.In the reproducing-side VTR 2, a reproducing head 3 is connected to one fixed
contact 5a of a head change-over switch 5, and a reproducing head 4 is connected to
the other fixed contact 5b of the head change-over switch 5. The switch 5 selectively
connects its movable contact 5c to one or the other fixed contact 
5a or 5b based on a switching signal supplied to a VTR main body
6 from a system controller, not shown.If the reproducing VTR 2 is either an analog VTR or
digital VTR, then video and audio signals output from the
reproducing VTR 2 are supplied to the DME 7 at transfer rate of
60 fields/second when the video and audio signals are NTSC
signals, and are supplied thereto at transfer rate of 50
fields/seconds when the video and audio signals are PAL signals.The DME 7 includes analog video and audio input
terminals and digital video and audio input terminals. The DME 7
is adapted to perform special effect processing on the video
signal from the reproducing VTR 2, such as mosaic effect,
movement, reduction, magnification, rotation of image or the
like, based on the transfer rate of 60 fields/seconds if the
video signal is the NTSC video signal and based on the transfer
rate of 50 fields/second if the video signal is the PAL video
signal. An output of the DME 7 is supplied to the recording VTR
8.The recording VTR 8 includes a recording head 9
connected to one fixed contact 11a of a head change-over switch
11 and a recording head 10 connected to the other fixed contact
11a of the head change-over switch
