<ABSTRACT>
What is disclosed is a novel toxic waste remediation system designed to provide on-site destruction of a wide variety of hazardous organic volatile hydrocarbons, including but not limited to halogenated and aromatic hydrocarbons in the vapor phase. This invention utilizes a detoxification plenum (31) and radiation treatment which transforms hazardous organic compounds into non-hazardous substances. Said plenum is shielded by surrounding earth. An accelerator electron (32) is coupled to said plenum with a window (35, 36). Vapor passes through the plenum where it is exposed to an electron beam and exits through outlets (42, 43).

<DESCRIPTION>
Hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOC) in soils and
groundwater can pose significant health risks, particularly if
aquifers which feed the water supplies of population centers
are threatened. Current remediation methods for treatment of
soil and groundwater include air stripping, vacuum extracting,
carbon containment, incineration/oxidation and bio-remediation.Air stripping and vacuum extracting are dispersion
technologies which extract vapors (the words vapors, VOCs and
gases are generally used interchangeably throughout and, unless
clearly understood otherwise, are intended to have the same
meaning) from the soil and vent the contaminants to the
atmosphere. While these techniques are relatively inexpensive
and can prevent or reduce groundwater contamination threats,
they are environmentally undesirable because they merely
change the medium of the pollution (from soil to air). Venting
is controversial and its use in the future is likely to be limited
by stricter air quality regulations.Carbon containment is a collection technology in which vapors 
from vapour extraction wells or other VOC sources are passed
through carbon (or other adsorbent) filled canisters to adbsorb
the VOCs. Collection technologies prevent or limit groundwater
contamination by reducing the contaminant level and can be cost
effective for certain flowrates and contamination levels.
However, containment is not a destruction technology; the VOCs
collected require removal and subsequent disposal. Also,
containment is not universally effective, as some VOCs have low
adsorptivity.Incineration involves high temperature burning of waste streams
from soil or air-stripped ground water for destruction of VOCs.
Incineration is highly controversial, often achieving only
incomplete destruction, and is costly. Incomplete destruction
can produce products more hazardous than the original
contaminant and has the potential of releasing them to the
atmosphere.Although prior art references disclose the use of electron beams
to reduce emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx) and/or nitrogen oxides'
(NOx) from conventional power plant facilities, systems are not
described which are mobile and effective in destroying VOCs.
This prior art describes how effluent gas from power plants can
be diverted into a reaction chamber where it can be irradiated
by electron beams before exiting the power plant as stack gas.
If beam power is sufficiently high, irradiation from the
electron beams can substantially reduce (though not completely
eliminate) SOx and NOx emissions
