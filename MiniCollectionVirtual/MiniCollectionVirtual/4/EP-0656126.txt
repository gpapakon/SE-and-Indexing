<ABSTRACT>
An optical device, e.g. a signal generator adapted to provide an optical signal to a fibre tail or to a socket adapted to receive a fibre tail, is assembled by two thin films of adhesive. One film is normal to the beam path and, preferably 50-200(my) thick. The other film is parallel to the beam path, e.g. surrounding the beam path, and preferably 30-90(my) thick. Conveniently the device includes an intermediary component and end of said film adheres one of said components to said intermediary component.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICAL DEVICESThis invention relates to optical devices and more particularly to an assembly for optical devices comprising two components which are required to be positioned with respect to each other so as to provide for the efficient transmission of optical signals from one to the other.The invention has an important application in the manufacture of optical communications apparatus where, for example, accurate and stable relative positioning is required between two components. For the present purposes it is convenient to identify one of the components as a source component and the other as a receptor component. It is a common requirement in optical communications to juxtapose these so that the receptor component is accurately located so as to acquire optical signals provided by the source component. For example, one of the components may comprise a passive optical device in the form of optical fibre waveguide, and the other component an active optical device such as a laser, photo diode. Accurate and stable relative positioning between the source component and the receptor component is required to ensure optimal and stable optical alignment of the optical devices. Similarly, such accurate and stable relative positioning may be required between two components comprising active devices or two components comprising passive devices.It is now convenient to identify the various forms of optical device which source components and receptor components commonly comprise. The source component may comprise a signal generator, e.g. a semiconductor device which converts electric power into an optical signal. Examples of such semiconductor devices include light emitting diodes (LED), edge emitting LEDs (ELED), and a wide variety of semiconductor lasers. Many of these devices comprise waveguiding structures. The signal generator often provides a divergent beam which is inconvenient for forming an optical connection. In such circumstances it is usual for the source component to include lenses which either collimate the beam or to cause it to converge to a focus. 

The source component may also comprise a passive device, e.g. a passive optical waveguiding structure such as an optical fibre.The receptor component may be an optical detector, e.g. a semiconductor device which converts an optical signal into an electrical signal. Examples of such devices include photo diodes and PIN diodes. The receptor component may also comprise a waveguiding structure, e.g. a passive waveguiding structure such as an optical fibre,
