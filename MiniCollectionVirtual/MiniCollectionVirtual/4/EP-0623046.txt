<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process and a device for the separation and purification of gas from a fibre suspension, especially residual gas after ozone delignification or pulp suspension, wherein the suspension together with the gas is introduced into a cyclone (2) or similar in which essential separation of suspension takes place, after which the essentially gas-free suspension is drawn off downwards and the gas (5) containing residual fibre and/or other impurities is drawn off upwards, the gas stream (5), before it is conducted away, being led through a liquid bath for separation of residual fibres and/or other impurities from the gas stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The following invention relates to a 
device and a process for the separation and purification of 
residual gas after ozone delignification of pulp 
suspension, wherein the suspension together with the gas is 
introduced into a cyclone, in which an 
essential separation of the suspension takes 
place after which the essentially gas-free suspension is 
drawn off downwards and the gas containing residual fibre 
and other impurities is drawn off upwards. In the following the invention will be 
described by referring to a specific field, namely the pulp 
industry, where the problem which the invention is intended 
to solve is well-known cf. EP-A-0 492 039 and EP-A-0 309 998, 
which is not, however, to be seen 
as having any limiting effect on the scope of the invention, 
which is defined by the subsequent patent claims. 
In the pulp industry the fibre suspension is often treated 
with gas, for example with the intention of bleaching the 
pulp. Subsequently it is desirable to separate the residues 
of the added treatment gas from the pulp before the latter 
is subjected to further treatment. Recently it has become 
much more common to use ozone in connection with bleaching 
the pulp. Ozone is produced using air or oxygen. After 
ozone bleaching the major part of the air or oxygen remains 
as a residual gas. This residual gas also contains small 
quantities of ozone. The residual ozone remaining after the 
treatment of the pulp cannot, for environmental reasons, be 
released directly into the atmosphere but must first be 
neutralised, which most frequently is achieved in a so-called 
"ozone destroyer". However, in order that it should function 
properly an "ozone destroyer" requires a very high degree  
 
of purity in the gas that is to be treated. This implies 
that the gas which is separated from the pulp suspension 
must be purified from residual fibres and any other 
impurities, such as sulphur dioxide (SO2), sulphuric acid 
(H2SO4), etc., before it is introduced into an "ozone 
destroyer". One purpose of the invention is thus to 
present a process and a device for the separation of 
residual fibre, etc., from an above-mentioned gas stream. A further purpose of the present invention 
is to present a process and a device for the 
separation of gas from a fibre suspension comprising a 
cleaning device which requires relatively little maintenance 
and which preferably can be run continuously.  
 These objects are achieved by a process and an apparatus 
as delineated respectively in claims 1 and 6, with

<CLAIMS>
Process for the separation and purification of a 
residual gas after ozone delignification of pulp 

suspension, wherein the suspension together with the gas 
is introduced into a cyclone (2) in which an essential 

separation of suspension takes place, after which the 
essentially gas-free suspension is drawn off downwards 

and the gas (5) containing residual fibre and other 
impurities is drawn off upwards, characterised in that 

the gas stream (5), before it is conducted away to an 
ozo
ne destroyer, is forced through a receiving device 
(6, 7) located above the cyclone and containing a liquid 

bath for separation of residual fibres and other 
impurities from the gas stream, wherein the said liquid 

bath is replenished continuously, or intermittently. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
drainage of liquid from the liquid bath takes place in 

such a way that the drained liquid moves in the opposite 
direction in relation to the gas that is being supplied 

to the liquid bath. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said liquid bath comprises at least one, preferably 

several, waterseals (10). 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the inlet speed of said fibre suspension into the cyclone 

(2) is greater than 10 m/s, preferably is between 
15-20 m/s. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said liquid bath is replenished and drained continuously. 
Device for carrying out the process according to 
claim 1 for the separation and purification of a residual  

 
gas after ozone delignification of a pulp suspension, 

comprising an inlet conduit (1), which opens essentially 
tangentially inside a cyclone casing (2), a collecting 

device (3) for suspension and an outlet conduit (4) for 
gas (5), said outlet conduit (4) being arranged inside 

the cyclone casing (2) characterised in said outlet 
conduit (4) being arranged at least partly essentially 

vertically, and that the upstream end of the outlet 
conduit (4) opens inside the cyclone (2) and the 

downstream end thereof opens inside a liquid 
bath-containing receptacle (6, 7) to force the gas 

through said liquid bath, wherein said receptacle (6, 7) 
contains a plate (8) with a number of holes to each of 

which is attached an upwardly-orientated pipe (10A), 
whose upper and lower ends are open and whose upper end 

opens inside a vessel (10C, 10D) situated outside and 
about it, which vessel is only open at the bottom and 

whose lower edge forms a gap with said plate (8). 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in 
that said cyclone (2) is arranged above the said 

collecting receptacle (3), which in the preferred case 
consists of a storage tower. 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that 
said pipe (10A) and/or vessel (10C, 10D) is/are fitted 

with one or more vertically-orientated slits (10G, 10H). 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in a 
conduit (11) for drawn off gases, which conduit (11) 

leads to an ozone destroyer.
