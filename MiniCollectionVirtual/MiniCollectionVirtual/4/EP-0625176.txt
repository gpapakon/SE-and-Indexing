<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polysiloxane release coating 
compositions which cure rapidly and completely in atmospheric moisture in a 
controllable manner and which have a level of release which can easily be 
adjusted from premium to tight. In the manufacture of many tape and label products in which a 
pressure sensitive adhesive is coated on a substrate such as paper or film, an 
essential component of the construction is the release coating. When a release 
coating is applied on the non-adhesive side of a backing, as in a roll of tape, it 
is commonly referred to as a "low adhesion backsize". The low adhesion 
backsize allows the roll of tape to be unwound with a reasonable amount of 
force (about 5 to 15 N/dm). On the other hand, a separate release coated sheet 
which is contacted with an adhesive coated side of a tape or label is referred to 
as a "liner", and in such a case, the peel force required to remove the tape or 
label is usually very low - typically less than about 1 to 2 N/dm. For this level 
of release, which is referred to as premium to easy, the usual coating material 
employed is some form of cured polysiloxane. These polysiloxanes are, for 
the most part, polydimethylsiloxanes substituted with a minimum number of 
various reactive functional groups. These polysiloxanes are coated on a 
substrate and subsequently chemically crosslinked. Ideally, these polysiloxanes 
should provide complete coverage of the substrate, cure completely to an ultra 
thin film (about 1 micron), have reasonable strength, be resistant to abrasion, 
and strongly adhere to the substrate. Other desirable features of such systems 
would include long term shelf stability and pot life prior to coating, followed by 
rapid cure on web, as well as the ability to easily adjust the release to higher 
levels than premium, if necessary. Few polysiloxane release coatings possess 
all of these optimal attributes. Over the years, a number of polysiloxane materials having 
different curing chemistries were developed as release liner coatings for 
pressure sensitive adhesives. One of the first to find widespread acceptance was 
a composition comprising high molecular weight silanol terminal 
polydimethylsiloxane and a low molecular weight crosslinking copolymer of  
 
dimethyl and methyl siloxane. Cure was effected by heating the composition in 
the presence of organometallic catalysts. Although reliable premium release was 
provided, the polysiloxane coating suffered from a number of drawbacks; it was 
useful only on paper, it
