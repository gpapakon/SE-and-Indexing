<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a protective material, which is bullet proof and proof against stabbing weapons, for the production of items of clothing. Such protective materials are already known but it has been found that these materials do not offer adequate protection particularly when the stabbing weapon is contaminated by any substance, such as grease or blood for example, since the known layers which are resistant to stabbing weapons then do not offer sufficient resistance. For this reason, the invention proposes to add a layer to the protective material, which layer is made from a metal foil with a hexagonal crystal structure in an arrangement remote from the body. This layer results in the stabbing weapon being cleaned by stripping off the contamination. A protective material having an inserted metal foil is illustrated in Fig. 2.

<CLAIMS>
Multilayer protective material for tailoring bullet- and
stabbing-proof garments,

characterized in that

a metal foil (1) of hexagonal metal structure is added to
the protective assembly which consists of several layers

(7,8,9), this metal foil being applied to the garment-side
aloof from the body, the foil (1) having such a minimum

thickness that several hexagonal crystals are superposed.
Garment according to Claim 1

characterized in that

the metal foil is connected to the tailored piece by glueing,
welding or sewing.
Garment according to Claims 1 or 2,

characterized in that

the metal foil (1) is formed by a fabric or a plait of
narrow strips (2,3).
Garment according to Claim 3

characterized in that

the width of the strips (2,3) is approximately 2 cm.
Garment according to Claim 3,

characterized in that

the metal foil plait or fabric is inserted into a plastic
foil.
Garment according to Claim 5,

characterized in that the plastic foil (4) protrudes on
one or on several sides over the metal foil plait or

fabric.
Garment according to one or to several of the preceding
Claims,

characterized in that the metal foil plait or fabric (1)
is formed by titanium foil strips (2,3). 
Garment according to one or to several of the preceding
Claims,

characterized in that

two metal foil plaits or fabrics (1) are arranged in a
staggered way.
Garment according to one or several of the preceding
Claims,

characterized in that the protective material is formed by
a fibre-reinforced foil (7) aloof from the body, followed

by one or several staggered metal foil fabrics or plaits
(1), the latter being followed by one or several layers

(8) for stabbing protection, and, closest to the body, a
tightly fitting layer for bullet protection (9).
Garment according to Claim 9,

characterized in that

the individual layers are connected to each other only at
their edges.
