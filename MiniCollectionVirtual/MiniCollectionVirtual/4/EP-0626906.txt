<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns laminates incorporating plastic layers (3, 3') and cellulose fibre layers (2) and a method for the production thereof. The plastic layers (3, 3') and the cellulose fibre layers (2) incorporated in the laminates can be separated intact from each other in aqueous defibering by virtue of a water-soluble polymer layer (1) placed adjacent to the fibrous layer (2), whereby all components of the laminate become recyclable for reuse. The laminates can be produced using extrusion coating/laminating methods. The laminates according to the invention are suited to use as, e.g., wrapper and packaging materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
Laminate and production method thereofThe present invention is related to a laminate according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a laminate incorporates at least one first layer comprised of cellulose fibers, at least one second layer spaced apart the first layer, said second layer being comprised of a material which is at least substantially insoluble in water, and at least one third layer which is arranged between said first and said second layer and is capable of interbonding said layers.The invention also concerns a method according to the preamble of claim 14 for producing said laminate, and the use thereof.Growing environmental problems, limited capacities of dump sites and resultant constraints imposed by the tightening regulatory measures compel toward an increasing degree of recycling in all activities, including the packaging sector. Traditionally, paper and paperboard have been utilized in recycling by way of repulping, that is, defibering of an aqueous waste paper slush. The industry also makes use of repulping methods compatible with combination fiber/plastic systems. The goal has been to separate plastic from fibre to the highest degree so that the fibre fraction can be reused.Prior-art technology suffers, however, from a problem in that conventional combination plastic/fiber products frequently contain plastics of low molecular weight (e.g., hot-melt glues), which in aqueous defibering are easily carried through into the fiber reuse process and cause impairment of paperboard or paper product produced by such a process. Furthermore, detachment of a pure polymer coating or plastic layer from a laminate structure is extremely difficult in aqueous defibering due to the strong adherence of plastic on cellulose fibres. In pulping such combination materials must be treated so vigorously that the detached plastic is torn into small pieces that despite the long washing times employed still contain plenty of 

paper fibres. The resultant plastic scrap finds hardly any recycling use, and consequentiy, its typical fate is combustion or dumping. Finally, the fibre fragmentation into so-called fines is promoted by the elongated aqueous defibering and relatively high temperature employed in waste paper furnish preparation process.To overcome the above-described drawbacks, the plastics industry has developed polymers soluble in acid or basic conditions. Such polymers have also been used in different types of laminates and similar products.The EP Patent Specification No. 316,676 describes adhesive layers
