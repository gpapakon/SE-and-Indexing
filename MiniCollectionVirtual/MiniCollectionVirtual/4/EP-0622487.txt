<ABSTRACT>
An enzyme composition, use thereof in a method for reducing 
the stickiness of honeydew contaminated cotton is disclosed. The 

composition includes, and the method uses, enzymes such as 
transglucosidases and pectinases capable of hydrolyzing sugars 

that make-up honeydew, which are derived from fungal sources, 
such as fungi of the genus 
Aspergillus

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of "Sticky
Cotton" for the reduction of the stickiness on the cotton fibers
and, in particular, to enzyme compositions and methods using such
enzyme compositions for the treatment of "Sticky Cotton" fiber
in order to obtain a reduction of the stickiness thereof."Sticky cotton" is a term used to refer to cotton fiber that
has thereon sticky sugar deposits which have been excreted by
certain (homopteran) insects (mainly the sweet potato whitefly
Bemisia tabaci and the cotton aphid, Aphis gossyppi) which feed
on cotton leaves above open bolls. Sticky cotton causes severe
problems during the milling of cotton. It is a problem faced by
cotton growers all over the world.The sticky substance on the cotton fibers of "Sticky cotton"
is called "honeydew". Honeydew is a complex mixture of mono-,
di-, trisaccharides and small amounts of protein and organic
acids (1,2). A typical composition of the honeydew produced by
white flies is 29.5 % oligosaccharides (including melezitose),
10.1 % sucrose, 5.3 % glucose, 11.7 % fructose, and 43.1 % trehalulose
(3).Honeydew on cotton makes it difficult to process the cotton
in gins and textile mills. Furthermore, the presence of such
honeydew enhances the microbial fermentation of fiber staining
fungi which greatly deleteriously effects the fiber quality of
the cotton. In gins, sticky cotton interferes with trash removal
and requires gin blades to be cleaned more frequently, slowing
the ginning operation. This can significantly reduce productivity.
In textile mills, honeydew interferes with the major
processing steps including carding, drawing, roving and spinning 
operations. Because of the adaptation of high speed technology,
sticky cotton is a major threat to cotton production in many
countries and plays an important quality consideration in the
textile industry.There seems to be limited work reported in reducing the
stickiness of infected cotton. Heating the sticky cotton to
130-140 °C for a short time was reported to caramelize the sugars
in honeydew to avoid stickiness during spinning (4). The application
of a hydrocarbon and surfactant additive to the cotton was
reported to eliminate the sticking problem in yarn manufacturing
(5). Another approach which has been reported is to spray
contaminated cotton bales with dilute solutions of ammonium
hydroxide or ammonium nitrate to enhance microbial breakdown of
the sugars in honeydew (2). Others have indicated the use of
insecticides to control cotton stickiness (6,7). The use of

<CLAIMS>
Use of at least one enzyme which is a
transglucosidase, a pectinase or an α-galactosidase for the

reduction of honeydew on sticky cotton contaminated with
honeydew.
The use of claim 1, wherein the enzymes include an
enzyme derived from a fungal source.
The use of claim 2, wherein the fungal source is a
fungus of the genus Aspergillus.
The use of claim 3, wherein the fungal source is a
fungus of the species Aspergillus niger.
The use of any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the
enzymes include a transglucosidase.
The use of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the
enzymes include a pectinase.
A method for the treatment of cotton fiber having
honeydew thereon, said method comprising contacting said

cotton fiber with an enzymatic composition including at
least one enzyme which is transglucosidase, a pectinase or

an α-galactosidase and is capable of hydrolyzing at least
one of the honeydew sugars of contaminated sticky cotton,

whereby the honeydew is at least partially hydrolyzed and
a reduction of the honeydew on the contaminated cotton is

provided.
The method of claim 7, wherein the enzymes include an
enzyme derived from a fungal source.
The method of claim 8, wherein the fungal source is a
fungus of the genus Aspergillus. 
The method of claim 9, wherein the fungal source is a
fungus of the species Aspergillus niger.
The method of any one of claims 7 to 10, wherein the
enzymes include a transglucosidase.
The method of any one of claims 7 to 11, wherein the
enzymes include a pectinase.
The method of any one of claims 7 to 12, wherein the
cotton has a percent moisture content of at least about

5.6% after application of the enzyme.
