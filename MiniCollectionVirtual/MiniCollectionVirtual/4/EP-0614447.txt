<ABSTRACT>
In a process for precipitating alumina hydrate from a stream of Bayer process liquor, wherein the stream (12) is first divided into a major (16) portion and a minor (14) portion, the minor portion fed to an agglomeration stage (18) and seeded (36) with fine seed to induce precipitation and formation of a slurry (38), and the major portion cooled (20) and charged with coarse seed and directed to a growth stage to induce formation of alumina hydrate product, the steps of: separating solids from the minor portion (40) after formation of the slurry; cooling, to a temperature of between about 45  DEG C and about 60  DEG C (46), the liquid remaining after separating solids from the slurry formed in the agglomeration stage; adding an amount of coarse seed (50) to the remaining liquid to generate a slurry of fresh hydrate nuclei (48); and recombining the slurry of fresh hydrate nuclei (36) with the major portion of the stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved processes 
for precipitating alumina hydrate from pregnant Bayer 
process liquor, and more particularly to a process for 
reducing the sodium content of alumina trihydrate produced 
by the Bayer process. Constant efforts have been made to improve the Bayer 
process in the more than hundred years since its 
invention. Some of those efforts have focused on attempts 
to increase the yield, particle size, and particle 
strength of the alumina recovered from Bayer process 
liquors. These attempts have included modifying various 
aspects of the process including dividing the incoming 
pregnant liquor stream into more than one part and feeding 
one part to a series of tanks known as the agglomeration 
section, while directing the remainder of the stream to a 
second series of tanks known as the growth section. For 
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,311,486 (Yamada) proposes 
dividing the incoming flow into two portions, and adding 
from 30-150 grams/litre of seed having a particle size of 
less than 10 µm to the agglomeration section. The patent 
also proposes adding from 30-150 grams/litre of coarse 
seed to the growth section. U.S. Patent No. 4,614,642 (Cristol) also divides the 
incoming pregnant liquor stream into two parts. According 
to that patent, 700 grams/litre of seed should be added to 
the agglomeration stage, and no seed should be added to 
the growth stage of the process. Other improvements in the Bayer process have also 
been disclosed for instance in U.S. Patent No. 5,102,426. 
They involve: (1) dividing the incoming Bayer process 
pregnant liquor stream into a major portion and a minor 
portion and adding to the minor portion a first particle  
 
size of seed to induce precipitation of alumina; and (2) 
passing the minor portion containing the first seed 
fraction through an agglomeration stage. The particles 
precipitated in the agglomeration stage are carried from 
the first circuit and reunited with the major portion of 
the stream. A second larger particle size seed is added 
to induce precipitation of alumina in the recombined 
stream in the growth stage. While the above improvements represent a major step 
forward in the Bayer process, in most instances it may be 
desirable to obtain alumina particles with even lower soda 
content than result from the practice of the above 
processes. As those of ordinary skill in the art know, an 
important objective in any design of a Bayer process 
improvement includes an attempt to obtain alumina product 
with as
