<ABSTRACT>
In a process for testing reusable plastic bottles for leakage the bottle (2) mouth is sealed and pressure inside the bottle (2) is adjusted. Recorded pressure data is stored and compared with a second measurement made after a variable time period. If the variation in pressure exceeds prescribed limits a signal is given to reject the bottle (2). Process appts. includes an inspection unit with a testing station having a controllable magnetic valve (3) for pressure adjustment, a pressure transducer (1) and a microprocessor for data storage and comparison.
