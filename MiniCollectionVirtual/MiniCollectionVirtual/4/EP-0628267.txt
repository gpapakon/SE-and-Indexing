<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a portable easel and is more particularly
directed to such an easel which may be easily handled, and collapsed for
convenient storage and transportation, but which is also sturdy and able to stand up
to heavy use and is very durable.Prior art documents US 3,195,849 and US 4,042,203 each disclose a
portable easel according to the pre-characterising portion of the appended claims.
Each of said portable easels comprises a base pedestal portion telescopically
engaged with a display portion upon which display materials may be removably
secured. The telescopic engagement of the base and display portions is such that
both easels may be moved between extended and collapsed configurations. In
order to move each easel between these configurations, interlocking means for
securing said portions in a selected position and leg means mounted on the base
portion must be independently manipulated. In each case, the interlocking means
generates a friction force between the base and display portions so as to secure said
portions together. This interlocking means is operated by a user acting on either a
spring biased stopper or a wing bolt. The leg means of each easel is foldably
mounted on the base pedestal portion and is hingedly rotated away from said
portion so as to provide a stable base for the easel when in an extended position.Although the friction type of interlocking means used in the
aforementioned prior art is adequate for light use, said interlocking means does not
provide an easel with a sturdy and durable frame capable of withstanding heavy
use. A third prior art easel is disclosed in US 2,680,932. This easel is
described as incorporating interlocking means of the friction type discussed above.
As an alternative, said easel is also described as incorporating interlocking means
employing a ratchet system. Although this alternative may be more robust than a
friction system, the ratchet mechanism is an unduly complex option which can be
awkward to use and may suffer from wear.A first aspect of the present invention provides a portable easel
comprising a base pedestal portion having leg means pivotally mounted on and
foldable toward and away from said base pedestal portion for securing said base
pedestal portion upright on a surface; a display portion telescopically engaged with
said base pedestal portion and having means for removably securing thereon
display materials; said portions being movable relative to one another into
extended and collapsed positions; said portions having
