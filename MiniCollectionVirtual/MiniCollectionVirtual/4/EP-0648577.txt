<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for shaping bars of reinforced concrete 
(3) comprises means for automatically loading the bars 

(19) adapted to pick up the bars (3) to be shaped from 
support slots (12a, 13a, 14a) and to unload them on two 

automated bending machines (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for 
shaping bars, particularly bars of reinforced concrete, 
of the type indicated in the pre-characterizing portion of Claim 1. 
An apparatus of this type is known from EP-A-0 419 441. Another known 
apparatus is 
described and shown for example in Italian patent 
application No. 53304-B/87 filed on 11 May 1987 and 
laid open to public inspection on 11 November 1988. 
This apparatus has been produced and marketed by the 
applicant for a long time. In this known apparatus, the bars to be shaped are 
fed above the bed and then subsequently picked up 
therefrom and positioned with their end portions 
resting on the two horizontal rotatable disks of the 
two bending machines. The position in the longitudinal 
direction of the bar to be shaped with respect to the 
two bending machines is determined by the abutment of 
one end of the bar against a fixed stop element 
provided on one of the two bending machines. The two 
machines are located at a distance from each other 
corresponding to the position of the bends to be 
carried out on the bar. In the case for example of a 
bar which is to have a single bend at 90 degrees at 
each one of its end portions, the two machines are 
positioned so that when the bar is laid down on the two 
rotatable disks of the bending machines, the two 
central pins of these disks are located at the bending  
 
regions. The two disks are then activated 
simultaneously so as to carry out the two end bendings 
by the offset pins, whereas the portion of the bar 
adjacent to each end portion is prevented from moving 
by the central pin and said support element, which are 
in contact with the bar on opposite sides thereof and 
at two regions thereof which are spaced apart from each 
other. In case the bar must be subjected to a second 
operation for a 90 degrees bend at some distance from 
the first one, so as to assume a C-shaped configuration 
at each end thereof, the two machines are located at 
the corresponding distance (once the rotatable disks 
are returned to their starting positions) and the two 
disks are again activated to carry out the second bend. 
In the apparatus produced and marketed by the 
applicant, the whole cycle of operations which has been 
described above is automated with the aid of a computer 
which automatically controls the displacement of the 
bending machines and the rotation of their rotatable 
disks as a function of a predetermined program, 
corresponding to the specific geometry of the shaped 
bar which is to

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for shaping bars, particularly bars 
of reinforced concrete (3), comprising: 


an elongated bed (1) for supporting the bars (3), 
a first and a second bending machines (4) movable 
relative to each other along a direction parallel to 

the longitudinal direction of the bed (1), adjacent to 
one side (11) thereof, each bending machine (4) having 

a bending device comprising a driven rotatable 
disk (7), having a central pin (8) and an 

offset pin (9), 
bar supporting means arranged on the side of the 
bed (1) facing towards the two bending machines (4) at 

a height not above the planar surface of the bed (1) 
and defining bar containing slots (12a, 13a, 14a), 

opened upwardly, adapted to contain more bars (3) 
superimposed on each other in a vertical plane parallel 

to the longitudinal direction of the bed, and 
means for automatically loading the bars on the 
bending machines (4), comprising at least one gripping 

member (19) associated with each bending machine (4) and 
displaceable between a position for picking 

up the bars (3) from said supporting means (12a, 13a, 
14a) and a position for unloading the bars (3) on the 

bending machines (4), 
 
   characterized in that said apparatus further comprises: 


a support element (10) provided on each 
bending machine (4) able to assume two different 

operating positions located on opposite sides with 
respect to a plane including the axes of the two 

rotatable disks (7) of the bending machines, said disks (7) being 
horizontal each 

operating position being on its turn adjustable in the 
direction transverse to said plane, and in that  

 
said gripping member 

being comprised of a slide (19) vertically movable on a 
carriage (16) which is horizontally movable with 

respect to a support structure (15) which is fixed to 
the bed (1), said slide (19) being provided at its 

upper part with a vertical slot (20) opened upwardly 
which is for receiving and supporting the bars (3) and 

provided with a jaw (21) for locking the bars in said 
slot (20). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said supporting means comprise at least two 

support brackets (12, 13) adjustable in position along 
the longitudinal direction of the bed (1) and having 

respective slots (12a, 13a), which are to receive and 
support the bars, said support brackets (12, 13) having 

their upper surfaces located not above the upper planar 
surface of the bed (2), so that the bars (3) may be 

loaded within said slots (12a, 13a) by making them roll 
on the upper planar surface (2) of the bed (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said supporting means comprises two pairs of 

support brackets (12, 13) adjustable in position and a 
support bracket (14) fixed to the bed (1) in a central 

position with respect to its longitudinal direction. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized 
in that one of said supporting bracket
s (12, 13) which 
are arranged adjacent to one end of the bed (1) is 

provided with a reference plate (13b) transverse to the 
longitudinal direction of the bed which is to act as a 

stop element for one end of the bars thus defining a 
reference for the proper positioning of the latter 

along the longitudinal direction.  
 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that a further gripping member is supported by a 

support structure (30) fixed to the bed (1) in a 
central position with respect to its longitudinal 

direction, said further gripping member being also 
comprised of a slide (19) vertically movable with 

respect to a carriage (16) guided horizontally on said 
fixed support structure (30), said slide (19) being 

also provided at its upper part with a slot (20) opened 
upwardly and provided with a locking jaw (21).
