arrangement. A magnetic field measuring equipment composed of the 

optical magnetic field sensor has a linearity error of ±1.0% or

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magneto-optical element 
having the Faraday effect and an optical magnetic field sensor 
composed by the use of the element. Recently, in particular, in the field of power industry, there 
has been proposed and commercially applied a magnetic field measuring 
equipment combining a magneto-optical element having the Faraday 
effect with an optical fiber, as a method of measuring a magnetic 
field intensity developing around an electric wire by the use of a 
light. The method of measuring a magnetic field intensity around a 
conductor through which a current flows to detect the current is 
characterized in that, for example, the method has good insulation 
properties because it uses the light as a medium, and is not 
subjected to an electromagnetic induction noise, so that the method 
is considered to be used for transmission/distribution facilities. Fig. 3 shows a principle diagram of a method of measuring a 
magnetic field by the use of the Faraday effect. In Fig. 3, a  
 
magneto-optical element 14 is arranged in a magnetic field H. An 
incident light 8a turned to a linearly polarized light by a polarizer 
13 is caused to pass through the magneto-optical element 14. The 
plane of polarization thereof is rotated in proportion to the 
magnetic field intensity H by the Faraday effect. Fig. 3 shows a 
case where the Faraday rotation exhibits a negative code. The 
linearly polarized light having been rotated passes through an 
analyzer 15 whose transmission-polarization direction is made 
different by 45 degrees from that of the polarizer 13, and then 
converted in the magnitude of the rotation angle ϑ thereof to a 
change in the intensity of an emitted light 8b. In order to 
compose this magneto-optical converting section, there is generally 
used an optical magnetic field sensor composed as shown in Fig. 2 
(see National Technical Report Vol. 38, No. 2, P. 127, 1992). In the optical magnetic field sensor composed as shown in Fig. 
2, an optical fiber 9 employs multi-node fibers having a core size 
80 µm, and a lens 12 employs self-focussing rod lens having a pitch 
0.25. The polarizer 13 and the analyzer 15 employ polarization 
beam splitters; and a full-reflecting mirror 16 is used to bend an 
optical path by 90 degrees. The polarization beam splitters and the 
full-reflecting mirror are cubes whose side each is 5 mm. The 
magneto-optical element 14 employs a rare-earth iron garnet crystal.  A system using the magnetic field measuring equipment to which
