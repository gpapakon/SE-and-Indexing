<ABSTRACT>
Oil distribution device consists of hollow rolls (15,16) having openings (18) for the oil and square-shaped end sections (23,24) which fit into corresp. shaped groove (25,26) of the roll frame (13,14). The oiling roll (11,12) fits over the rolls (15,16) and can freely rotate. The sections (23,24) are held in the frames by screw device (27).

Apparatus (10) for greasing strip- or board-shaped
workpieces, having a plurality of hollow greasing rollers

(11, 12) provided with grease-permeable material, aligned
parallel to one another and rotatably mounted in each

case on a hollow axle (15, 16), which is disposed in a
frame (13, 14) and through which the greasing agent may

be supplied to the interior of the greasing rollers (11,
12) via a plurality of closable, radial grease outlet

openings (18) disposed in the longitudinal direction of
said greasing rollers, each hollow axle (15, 16) being

provided at either end with a shaped piece (23, 24),
which is insertable positively into a correspondingly

configured recess (25, 26) in the frame (13, 14) and is
held releasably therein by means of a locking device

(27), 
characterized in
 that the hollow axle (15, 16) is
insertable in feed direction (arrow 28) or counter to

feed direction in a plane (29, 30) extending parallel to
the plane of passage (21) of the workpiece or in a plane

extending obliquely relative to the plane of passage (21)
of the workpieces into the recesses (25, 26) in the frame

(13, 14), the hollow axle (15, 16) with its shaped pieces
(23, 24) being exchangeable in the manner of a drawer for

another hollow axle.
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the
shaped pieces (23, 24) at either end of the hollow axle

(15, 16) and the corresponding recesses (25, 26) in the
frame (13, 14) are cuboidal or cube-shaped.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or according to claim 2,

characterized in
 that the shaped pieces (23, 24) and the
corresponding recesses (25, 26) in the frame (13, 14) are

made semi-circular at one end and provided with
continuously adjoining, plane surfaces, which are

parallel to one another. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in
 that the locking device (27) comprises
hexagon head or hexagon socket or slotted head screws

(31, 32), which extend through bores (35) in the frame
(13, 14), engage with their external thread (33) into a

corresponding internal thread (34) of the bores (35) and
clampingly lock the shaped piece (23, 24) at at least one

surface (38).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in
 that the screws (31, 32) comprise hollow
screws with a ball (36), which is preloaded by a spring

and in the locking position engages into a spherical
recess (37) provided in the shaped piece (23, 24).
Apparatus according to claim 5, 
characterized in
 that the
initial tension of the spring is advantageously high

enough to preclude independent loosening of the hollow
screws (31, 32) under the influence of all conceivable

external forces, including vibrational forces.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in
 that the screws (31, 32) at their head
are locked against unintentional rotation by spring

washers and at their free end are provided with a cutting
ring or a centring cone, which in the locking position

engage into an annular or conical recess provided in the
shaped piece (23, 24).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9,

characterized in
 that the shaped pieces (23, 24) and
their corresponding recesses (25, 26), for definite

association of the grease outlet openings (18), are
designed differently and so as to allow only one

insertion possibility.
