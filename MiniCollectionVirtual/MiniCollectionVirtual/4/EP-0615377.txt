<ABSTRACT>
Currently arranging a reliable delivery for facsimile messages is a problem in local area 
network environment because further deliveries are not possible when facsimile messages 

have been received and thus manual interventions are required to make sure that the 
facsimile message reaches it's intended recipien
t. The invention subject to this patent 
provides a way of accomplishing an 
automatic
 facsimile delivery in a local area network 
environment. 
The Originator of the Facsimile (OF) sends a Facsimile Message (FM)to a predefined 
Telephone Number (TN). This Telephone Number (TN) belongs to a set of numbers 

which are located in a Facsimile Delivery System (FDS). The Facsimile Delivery System 
(FDS), which is connected to Switched Telephone Network (STN), then receives the 

Facsimile Message (FM) and after having received and stored the Facsimile Message 
(FM) the Facsimile Delivery System (FDS) forwards the same Facsimile Message (FM) 

together with the Telephone Number (TN) to the Local Area Network Server (LANS). 
The Local Area Network Server (LANS) extracts the Telephone Number (TN) from the 

Facsimile Message (FM) and forwards the Facsimile Message (FM) to the Intended 
Recipient (IR) by means of an Electronic Mail System (EMS).

<DESCRIPTION>
Facsimile communication is a necessity in business today and facsimile has 
been accepted as an important tool by all businesses because it provides a 
quick and reliable way to get the message accross. Together with the proliferation of facsimile messaging a rapid increase in 
the number of local area network installations has been experienced. Thus 
a workstation of some kind can be found from almost any desk and local 
area networks linking thousands of them are in place making it possible 
for people to share information. Communication within a group of people 
having access to workstations within a network is quick and easy: 
electronic mail systems make a good backbone for efficient 
communication. Workstation to workstation, or people to people, 
communication can be easily accomplished by means of the wide variety 
of electronic mail systems available on the market today. Recent trend has been to replace existing facsimile machines with an 
electronic facsimile board attached to a server within a local area network. 
The facsimile board can serve for a gateway to the workstations within 
the network. A facsimile message originated by a workstation user can be 
transferred to the facsimile board to be forwarded to the intended 
destination facsimile machine. Electronic mail systems can be utilized to 
make those transfers taking place conveniently and transparently for the 
user and thus the scheme works excellently as far as outgoing faxes are 
concerned. Typically the electronic facsimile boards available for local area network 
servers have capability for receiving facsimile messages in addition to 
being able to send them. However, the delivery of the received facsimile 
can not usually be arranged in a straightforward manner as it is necessary 
that a human operator will read the name located in the message cover 
sheet in order to decide who is the intended recipient. A lot of efforts 
have been put to design various different types of devices and software 
modules which could somehow intercept and decode the names in the first 
few pages in the facsimile, but due to the fact that facsimiles can be 
received from hundreds if not thousands originators it is almost impossible 
to devise any general purpose methodologies to accomplish the said task. 
Therefore this identification of intended recipients of incoming facsimile 
messages is an issue which has seriously slowed down the proliferation of 
local area network and facsimile integration. The invention subject to this 
patent addresses

<CLAIMS>
A method for arranging deliveries of facsimile messages (FM) in a 
computer system, for example in local area network (LAN) 

environment, characterized in that facsimile messages can be 
forwarded automatically, without human intervention, by allocating 

Unique Telephone Numbers (UTN) to users and allowing 
Originating Facsimiles (OF) to send Facsimile Messages (FM) to 

Facsimile Delivery Systems (FDS) using the Unique Telephone 
Number (UTN) and allowing the Facsimile Delivery System (FDS) 

to forward the same message together with identification of the user 
to the Local Area Network Server (LANS) which, based on the user 

identification information, can further forward the message to the 
Intended Recipient (IR).
