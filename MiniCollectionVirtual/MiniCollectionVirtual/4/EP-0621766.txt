<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to an organ equivalent of the cornea part of the eye made using tissue culturing systems. The method of constructing the cornea equivalent results in a structure analogous to the eye cornea in vivo. The cornea equivalent is an in vitro model of the eye, which can be used for transplantation or implantation in vivo or for screening compounds in vitro.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of tissue culture
systems and is directed to an organ equivalent of the cornea
of the eye: a cornea equivalent model. The tissue culture
method of constructing the cornea equivalent model results
in a construct analogous to the eye cornea in vivo. The
cornea equivalent is an in vitro model of the eye, which can
be used for transplantation or implantation in vivo or for
screening compounds in vitro.Tissue culture techniques are being successfully
used in developing tissue and organ equivalents. The basis
for these techniques involve collagen matrix structures,
which are capable of being remodeled into functional tissue
and organs by the right combination of living cells,
nutrients, and culturing conditions. Tissue equivalents
have been described extensively in many patents, including
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,485,096; 4,485,097; 4,539,716; 4,546,500;
4,604,346; and 4,837,379.One successful application of the
tissue equivalent is the living skin equivalent, which has a
morphology similar to actual human skin. The living skin
equivalent is composed of two layers: the upper portion is
made of differentiated and stratified human epidermal 
keratocytes that cover a thicker, lower layer of human
dermal fibroblasts in a collagen matrix. Bell, et al.,
"Recipes for Reconstituting Skin," J.ofBiochemical
Engineering, 113: 113-119 (1991).Studies have been done on culturing corneal
epithelial and endothelial cells. Xie, et al., "A
simplified technique for the short-term tissue culture of
rabbit corneal cells," InVitroCellular&Developmental
Biology, 25: 20-22 (1989), and Simmons, et al., "Corneal
Epithelial Wound Closure in Tissue Culture: An in vitro
Model of Ocular Irritancy," ToxicologyandApplied
Pharmacology, 88: 13-23 (1987). Developing an in vitro
organ equivalent of the cornea of the eye is of particular
interest for use in in vitro toxicity assays to serve as
accurate and inexpensive non-animal predictive models of in
vivo ocular and dermal irritation potential for many types
of products and raw materials.
Insler et al (Current Eye Research,5(12), 967-972 (1986))
describe a process in which the endothelium is removed from an
eyebank cornea, following which the cornea is seeded with a
suspension of cultivated neonatal endothelial cells.US 4,760,020 relates to an in vitro method for testing
substances for biocompatibility. The method comprises treating
cells, for example corneal endothelial cells, so as to provide
a repeatable disruption of the cells, contacting the cells with
the test
