<ABSTRACT>
An olefin polymerization catalyst is provided 
which is composed of an olefin-prepolymerized catalyst 

prepared by prepolymerizing an olefin on a catalyst 
formed from (a) a carrier, (c) an organoaluminumoxy 

compound, and (d) a metallocene compound; (e) an 
organoaluminum compound, and (f) an ionizing ionic 

compound. The olefin-prepolymerized catalyst may be 
prepared with an organoaluminum compound as an additional 

component of the catalyst. A process for producing a 
polyolefin is also provided polymerizes or 

copolymerize olefin in the presence of the above olefin 
polymerization catalyst. This catalyst exhibits high 

catalyst activity in olefin polymerization even when the 
catalyst contains a smaller amount of an 

organoaluminumoxy compound, and the polyolefin production 
process gives a polymer having excellent particle 

properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an olefin 
polymerization catalyst which is constituted of a 
prepolymerized catalyst formed by prepolymerizing an 
olefin, an ionizing ionic compound, and an organoaluminum 
compound, or the catalyst further containing a Lewis base 
compound. The present invention also relates to an 
olefin polymerization process employing the above 
catalyst. More specifically, the present invention is 
characterized in that a prepolymerized catalyst obtained 
by prepolymerization of olefin with a small amount (compared to the 
prior art) of an organoaluminumoxy compound and a metallocene compound is 
activated with an organoaluminum compound and an ionizing 
ionic compound, which is capable of causing other compounds 
to ionize. In production of polyolefins, catalysts are 
known which are constituted of a combination of a 
transition metal compound and an organometallic compound. 
Kaminsky, et al. disclosed that a catalyst formed from a 
metallocene and methylaluminoxane has high activity in 
polymerization of olefin including propylene (Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-open No. 58-19309). The catalyst systems employed in the above 
patent publications, although they have excellent 
activity for polymerization, are used in most cases in 
solution polymerization owing to the solubility thereof  
 
in the reaction systems. In addition to the limitation 
of the polymerization process, the relatively expensive 
aluminoxane have to be used in a large quantity to 
produce a polymer having industrially useful properties, 
which involve the disadvantages of high production cost 
and excessive aluminum residue in the resulting polymer. On the other hand, Japanese Patent Application 
Laid-Open No. 60-35006 discloses catalyst systems 
which comprise the aforementioned soluble catalyst system 
supported on an inorganic oxide carrier like silica, and 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 63-152608 discloses a 
catalyst system comprising an olefin-prepolymerized 
component to improve properties of the resulting polymer 
particles formed by gas-phase polymerization. Such 
catalysts, however, do not have sufficient polymerization 
activity per unit weight of methylaluminoxane. To improve the activity per unit weight of 
methylaluminoxane, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
Nos. 4-8704, 4-11604, and 4-213305, for example, disclose 
a catalyst system containing less methylaluminoxane and 
modified by prepolymerization for gas phase 
polymerization which gives a polymer having satisfactory 
particle
