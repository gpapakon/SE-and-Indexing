<ABSTRACT>
A process for the substantial reduction or 
complete elimination of ammonium sulfate generated during 

the production of acrylonitrile by the direct ammoxidation 
of propylene/propane, ammonia and an oxygen containing gas 

(e.g. air) over a fluid bed catalyst wherein the 
improvement comprises introducing methanol into said 

reactor in the upper portion of the reactor at a location 
where the methanol reacts with at least a portion if not 

substantially all of the excess ammonia without affecting 
the acrylonitrile yield. Preferably, methanol is 

introduced into the reactor at below its coking 
temperature. In particular, when an oxygen lean fluid bed 

catalyst is utilized, an additional oxygen containing gas 
is introduced into the reaction at a distance between 

about 8 to 14 inches from the methanol feed location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to substantial
reduction of unreacted ammonia and the corresponding
reduction in ammonium sulfate and resulting waste products
produced from the unreacted ammonia during the manufacture
of acrylonitrile by the direct ammoxidation of an
unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon, preferably propylene
or propane, ammonia and oxygen in a fluid bed reactor
containing an ammoxidation catalyst. In particular, the
present invention is directed to the addition of at least
one oxygen containing compound, preferably methanol, at a
specific location in the fluidized bed reactor during the
manufacture of acrylonitrile to reduce substantially the
amount of ammonia remaining in the gaseous effluents
exiting the fluidized bed reactor which translates into a
substantial reduction of the production of ammonium
sulfate during the recovery and purification of the
acrylonitrile so produced. This substantial reduction or
complete elimination in the generation of ammonium sulfate
during the practice of the manufacture of acrylonitrile
leads to significant environmental and economic
advantages. In another embodiment of the practice of the
present invention the amount of unreacted ammonia can
completely be eliminated leading to complete elimination
of the production of ammonium sulfate during the recovery
and purification of acrylonitrile.There are several patents which address the
issue of the injection of methanol into a fluid bed
reactor to produce hydrogen cyanide. In addition, these
references further disclose the injection of methanol into
an acrylonitrile fluid bed reactor to produce hydrogen
cyanide while manufacturing acrylonitrile. For example, 
U.S. Patents 3,911,089 and 4,485,079 each teach the
ammoxidation of methanol to produce hydrogen cyanide by
injection of methanol into a fluid bed reactor containing
an ammoxidation catalyst suitable for the manufacture of
acrylonitrile. In addition, each of these references
teach that the methanol injection can be made
simultaneously with the manufacture of acrylonitrile.
Moreover, Japanese Patent Applications 74-87,474, 79-08655
and 78-35232 all are related to similar methods of
increasing or making hydrogen cyanide during the
manufacture of acrylonitrile. Japanese Patent
Application 74-87,874 also suggests that a secondary
effect of their procedure is the decrease of the amount of
sulfuric acid used for neutralization. All of these
patents are primarily concerned with the production of
additional hydrogen cyanide.The present invention is
