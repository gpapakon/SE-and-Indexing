<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ionomers, as well as to methods of using 
such ionomers, and cements formed with such ionomers. The materials known as dental ionomer cements have many 
applications in dentistry including use as filling materials for restoring teeth and 
for cementing inlays and crowns into place in the tooth, providing a base or a 
lining in a tooth cavity, id as adhesives or sealants. An ionomer cement is 
formed by reacting 1) an ionomer polymer with 2) a reactive glass. This 
reaction is typically done in water. Ionomer polymers traditionally have been copolymers of two or 
more monomers. For example, itaconic acid and acrylic acid have often been 
copolymerized to form such an ionomer polymer. The polymer is formed by 
reacting the two monomers together using a free radical polymerization 
mechanism. The ionomer polymer is called such because of its inherent acidity 
resulting from the numerous acid pendant groups. After the polymer is made it is often dissolved in water for later 
mixing with the reactive glass. The reactive glass used in the ionomer cement is 
often an ion-leachable glass, such as those based on calcium aluminosilicate 
glasses, or more recently, borate glasses. For a general discussion, see Prosser 
et al., Polyelectrolyte Cements, Wilson and Prosser, eds., Developments in 
Ionic Polymers - 1, Chapter 5, Applied Science Publishers (London and New 
York, 1983). The glass is finely ground into a powder to facilitate mixing with 
the ionomer polymer solution. In the setting reaction, the glass powder behaves like a base and 
reacts with the acidic polyelectrolyte, i.e., ionomer polymer, releasing metal 
ions to form a metal polysalt which acts as the binding matrix. Water serves as 
the reaction medium and allows the transport of ions in what is essentially an 
ionic reaction. The setting reaction is therefore characterized as a chemical 
cure system that proceeds automatically upon mixing the ionomer polymer and 
glass powder in the presence of water. The cements set to a gel-like state within 
a few minutes and rapidly harden to develop strength. See, e.g., Prosser et al., 
J. Chem. Tech. Biotechnol., 29, 69-87 (1979). Chelating agents, such as tartaric acid, have been described as 
useful for modifying the rate of setting, e.g., to provide longer working times  
 
for the cements. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,089,830, 4,209,434, 4,317,681, 
4,374,936, and 4,758,612. Longer working times afford the dentist more time 
to mix the cement and apply the cement to the tooth.
