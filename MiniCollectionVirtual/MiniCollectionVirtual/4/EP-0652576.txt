According to a method of manufacturing a solid 
electrolytic capacitor of the present invention, a 

surface of an anode consisting of a valve metal and 
having a lead (7) extending therefrom is oxidized to form a 

dielectric layer (2). A chemical oxidation and 
polymerization process is performed using an oxidant, 

and a first conductive polymer compound layer (3) is formed 
on the dielectric layer (2). An undoped polymer compound 

layer is formed on the first conductive polymer compound 
layer (3) using a solution containing a polymer compound 

polymerized in advance and soluble in an organic 
solvent, and then proton acid is doped in the undoped 

polymer compound layer to make the undoped polymer 
compound l

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a solid electrolytic capacitor and, more 
particularly, to a method of manufacturing a solid 
electrolytic capacitor using a conductive polymer 
compound as a solid electrolyte. A general solid electrolytic capacitor has a 
structure in which a molded porous body consisting of a 
valve metal such as tantalum or aluminum is used as an 
anode, an oxide coating of the valve metal is used as a 
dielectric, and a solid electrolyte such as manganese 
dioxide or a 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) 
complex salt serves as part of a cathode. In this case, 
although the solid electrolyte has a function of 
electrically connecting the entire surface of the 
dielectric in the molded porous body to an electrode 
lead, the solid electrolyte desirably has a function of 
repairing electrical short-circuiting caused by the 
dielectric oxide coating defect. For this reason, a 
metal having a high electrical conductivity but having 
no dielectric repair function is not suitable as the 
solid electrolyte. Therefore, manganese dioxide or the  
 
like which is changed into an insulator due to heat 
generated by a short-circuiting current has been used as 
the solid electrolyte. However, when manganese dioxide is used as 
part of an electrode, the impedance is high in a 
high-frequency range because the conductivity of the 
manganese dioxide is not satisfactorily high. On the 
other hand, when the TCNQ complex salt is used as part 
of an electrode, heat resistance is lowered because the 
TCNQ complex salt tends to be thermally decomposed. 
Therefore, solid electrolytic capacitors using the above 
materials have various problems left unsolved. In recent years, new solid electrolyte 
materials have been developed in the field of polymers. 
As a result, various solid electrolytic capacitors 
using, as solid electrolytes, conductive polymer 
compounds obtained by doping electron donor or acceptor 
compounds (dopants) in conjugated polymer compounds such 
as polypyrrole, polythiophene, and polyaniline are 
proposed. For example, a method of forming a 
polyaniline film by polymerizing an aniline monomer on a 
dielectric oxide coating using an oxidant is proposed. 
However, according to this method, only a polyaniline 
film having a small thickness can be formed. For this 
reason, this polyaniline film may be removed from the 
dielectric oxide coating by thermal stress generated 
when a solid electrolytic capacitor is mounted. At this  
 
time, the oxide coating may
