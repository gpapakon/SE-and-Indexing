<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for use in determining the position of an 
object such as a sash door of a laboratory fume hood which has 

an elongated base member for attachment to the fume hood 
adjacent the sash doors. It includes an electrical switching 

means having an elongated electrical resistance means that 
provides a signal indicative of the position of a sash door, 

and an actuator means associated with each sash door adapted 
to move when the sash door is moved. The actuator means 

includes an actuator assembly positioned to operate the 
switching means at a switch location that varies as the sash 

door is moved. The actuator means includes a linkage means 
that permits accurate operation even though there is undesirable 

movement of the door relative to the base member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
apparatus which determines the position of one or more 
structures that are generally moveable along a predetermined 
path. The present invention is particularly suited for use in 
determining the position of moveable doors, such as sash doors 
that are moveable in associated tracks of a laboratory fume 
hood. Fume hoods are utilized in various laboratory 
environments for providing a work place where potentially 
dangerous chemicals are used, with the hoods comprising an 
enclosure having moveable doors at the front portion thereof 
which can be opened in various amounts to permit a person to 
gain access to the interior of the enclosure. The enclosure 
is typically connected to an exhaust system for removing any 
noxious fumes so that the person will not be exposed to them 
while performing work in the hood. Fume hood controllers which control the flow of air 
through the fume hood have become more sophisticated in recent 
years, and are now able to more accurately maintain the 
desired flow characteristics to efficiently exhaust the fumes 
from the enclosure as a function of the desired average face 
velocity of the opening of the fume hood. The average face 
velocity is generally defined as the flow of air into the fume 
hood per square foot of open face area of the fume hood, and 
the controller must have an accurate indication of this open 
face value to attain the desired average face velocity.  
 The sash doors of fume hoods can be opened by 
raising them vertically, often referred to as the sash 
position, or some fume hoods have a number of doors that are 
mounted for horizontal sliding movement in typically two sets 
of tracks. Prior art fume hood controllers have included 
sensing means for measuring the absolute position of vertical 
doors or the relative positions of horizontal doors and then 
using a signal proportional to the sensed position to thereby 
vary the speed of the blowers or to vary the position of the 
dampers. One system for determining the position of a 
moveable structure such as sash doors of a fume hood is disclosed 
in U.S. Patent 5,090,304 by Egbers et al. The system 
disclosed therein includes electrical circuitry for providing 
signals indicating the position of the sash doors, and 
includes an electrical switching means to generate the 
signals. EP-A-559 634 which is prior art within the meaning of Article 54(3) EPC 
describes a measuring member fixed to a housing. The measuring member 
includes an elongated resistance
