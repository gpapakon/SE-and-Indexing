<ABSTRACT>
In an appearance examination apparatus for solid 
article such as capsules, tablets and the like, the solid 

articles are all oriented in the horizontal direction in the 
same manner in a plurality of feeding lines while they are 

transferred from a hopper (12) to a feeding drum (10), a 
first restriction drum (20) and a second restriction drum 

(30). The solid articles (1) are continuously supplied to 
an examination drum (40) which intermittently rotates at 

predetermined time intervals. The solid articles (1) are 
held in predetermined positions between first and second 

examination rollers (41, 42) and are always rotated. An 
image pick-up device (60) observes the entire surface of the 

solid articles (1) and the inferior articles are removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an appearance examination 
apparatus for solid articles which have a rotationally 
symmetrical shape such as a hard-type or soft-type capsule, 
a Rugby ball shaped or sphere tablet, and the like. A conventional appearance examination apparatus for 
solid articles, which is shown in Publication Gazette of 
Examined Japanese Patent Application Sho 54-18955 is 
described referring to FIG.5. In FIG.5, an examination head 
200 is intermittently rotated around its rotation axis on a 
horizontal plane. A plurality of rollers 201 are provided 
in the vicinity of an outer periphery of the examination 
head 200. The rollers 201 are rotated in the 
counterclockwise direction around their rotation axes 202 as 
shown by arrow B. Solid articles 1 are conveyed in the 
vertical direction by buckets 220 which are driven by a 
chain mechanism. When bucket 220, which conveys the solid 
article 1, reaches the same horizontal plane as the 
examination head 200, a plunger 221 pushes the solid article 
1 in the direction shown by arrow D. Thus, the solid 
article 1 is transferred to the examination head 200 from 
the bucket 220. In the examination head 200, air is removed 
by a vacuum in the direction shown by arrow A; so that the  
 
solid article 1 is held between two adjacent rollers 201. 
Since the rollers 201 rotate in the counterclockwise 
direction as shown by arrow B, the solid article 1 receives 
reaction forces from the rollers 201. Thereby, the solid 
article 1 rotates in the clockwise direction as shown by 
arrow C. When the solid article 1 reaches predetermined 
position X, a light beam is emitted from a light source 203. 
Reflected light 204 from the solid article 1 is input to a 
photocell 208 through a slit 207 which has a predetermined 
shape corresponding to the basic shape of the solid articles 
1. Suspended time of the examination head 200 is set to be 
longer than the time that the solid article 1 needs for at 
least one rotation. Thus, the photocell 208 receives the 
reflected light from entire outer surface of the solid 
article. When the solid article 1 has no defect on its 
surface, the output level of the photocell 208 does not 
change. However, when an extraneous material is adhered to 
the surface of the solid article 1, or when the surface of 
the solid article 1 is uneven, the light reflected from 
these parts will change. Thus, the output of the photocell 
208 will change. By detecting the change in the output of 
the photocell 208, the defective article can be found.
