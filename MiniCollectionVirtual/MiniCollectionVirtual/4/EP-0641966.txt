<ABSTRACT>
The installation according to the invention comprises a supporting structure (5) which can be moved vertically, a horizontal table (6) able to pivot relative to the supporting structure about a vertical axis (7), a carriage (8) which can move along the table, two anvils (10) suspended from the carriage and able to come into engagement with the valve (1) in the region of the square fitting (2), a gas feeding head (12) suspended from the table (6) and able to be moved relative to the carriage (8) to allow sealed coupling of its connector piece with the filling/draining adaptor of the valve when the anvils (10) are tightened and a screwing/unscrewing bell (14) borne by the supporting structure (5) and able to come into engagement with the operating knob (3) for opening the valve after the connection between the connector piece (13) and the filling/draining adaptor (4) has been made, and for closing the valve after the bottle (cylinder) has been filled.

Installation for automatically filling gas
cylinders which are provided with a tap (1) including a

square base (2) at its lower part, a hand wheel (3) at
its upper part and a filling/emptying end (4) extending

horizontally between the square base and the hand wheel,
said installation comprising, on a supporting structure

(5) which is movable vertically, a gas supply head (12)
including a horizontal connecting end (13) facing towards

the filling/emptying end (4) of the tap (1) of the gas
cylinder to be filled, and a screwing/unscrewing device

(14) which is movable vertically into engagement with the
hand wheel (3) of said tap and capable of rotationally

driving the latter in order to open or close it,
characterized in that it further comprises a horizontal

table (6) suspended from the supporting structure (5) and
pivotable with respect to the latter about a vertical

axis (7), a carriage (8) mounted on table (6) and movable
with respect to the latter in two predetermined opposite

directions (9), and two jaws (10) suspended from the
carriage (8) and movable in the opposite direction with

respect to the latter, said jaws facing towards one
another and being engagable with the tap (1), at the

square base (2) and in a region diametrically opposite
the filling/emptying end (4), the gas supply head (12)

being suspended from the table (6) and movable with
respect to the carriage (8) to allow a tight coupling of

its connecting end with the filling/emptying end when the
jaws (10) are engaged with the tap (1), while the

screwing/unscrewing device (14) is carried by the
supporting structure (5) and is rotatably mounted about

the pivot axis (7) of the table (6).
Installation according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the table (6) is suspended from the supporting

structure (5) through the use of a hollow post (16)
extending vertically, said post being fixed to the table

at its lower end and rotatably mounted in a horizontal
bearing (17) provided on the supporting structure

adjacent its upper end. 
Installation according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the jaws (10) are disposed symmetrically

with respect to the vertical plane (P
1
) containing the
pivot axis (7) of the table (6) and extending parallel to

the opposite directions of movement (9) of the carriage
(8).
Installation according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the jaws (10) each comprise

a first, a second and a third active surface (18, 19a,
19b), the first active surfaces (18) being capable of

interacting with the two sides of the square base which
are parallel to the filling/emptying end (4), while the

second and third active surfaces (19a, 19b) are capable
of interacting respectively with the upper face of the

square base (2) and with the region of the tap (1) which
is diametrically opposite the filling/emptying end (4),

wherein the longitudinal axis of the connecting end (13)
of the gas supply head (12) and the longitudinal axis of

the filling/emptying end (4) of the tap are coincident
when the jaws (10) are clamped onto the tap (1).
Installation according to any of the preceding

claims, characterized in that the jaws (10) are situated
at the lower end of two vertical arms (20) secured to two

horizontal guide members (21) which are movable in
opposite directions in two elongate openings (22) formed

in the carriage (8) perpendicularly to the opposite
directions of movement (9) of the latter.
Installation according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the horizontal guide members (21) each carry a

flange (23) projecting above the table (6) and are
movable under the control of at least one cylinder (24)

and of at least one tension spring (25) connecting the
flanges (23), the cylinder and the spring being

perpendicular to the opposite directions of movement (9)
of the carriage (8).
Installation according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the gas supply head (12)

includes a body extending vertically and is symmetrical
with respect to the vertical plane (P
1
) containing the 
pivot axis (7) of the table (6) and extending parallel to

the opposite directions of movement (9) of the carriage
(8).
Installation according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the gas supply head (12) is

secured to a horizontal base plate (26) carried by the
table (6) and movable with respect to the carriage (8) in

the two opposite directions of movement (9) of the
latter.
Installation according to Claim 8, characterized
in that the horizontal base plate (26) and the carriage

(8) each carry a flange (27, 28) projecting above the
table (6), the flanges (27, 28) being connected by at

least one cylinder (29) and at least one tension spring
(30) extending parallel to the opposite directions of

movement (9) of the carriage (8).
Installation according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the screwing/unscrewing

device (14) is formed by a bell mounted at the lower end
of a vertical rod (31) passing through orifices provided

in the table (6) and the carriage (8), and the
longitudinal axis of which is coincident with the pivot

axis (7) of the table (6).
Installation according to Claim 10, characterized
in that the vertical rod (31) carrying the

screwing/unscrewing bell (14) extends partially into the
hollow post (16) connecting the table (6) to the

supporting structure (5).
Installation according to Claim 10 or 11, characterized
in that the rod (31) is movable vertically under

the control of a cylinder (34) carried by the supporting
structure (5).
Installation according to Claim 10 or 12,
characterized in that the rod (31) is rotatably secured

to a horizontal gear (36) through which it passes and
