A refrigerator door (1) with a bowl-shaped inner wall (2) is, on the inside of its vertical web-shaped edges (3), provided with, at a distance from one another, catch recesses (16) or knob-like projections for catching on the side parts (4, 4') of compartments (5) held on the [lacuna]. In order to produce particularly simply installed and economically manufacturable compartments (5), the side parts (4, 4') are, in their lower edge regions on their mutually facing sides, provided with grooves, into which the edges (40, 41) of a glass plate (6) forming the compartment bottom are inserted.
