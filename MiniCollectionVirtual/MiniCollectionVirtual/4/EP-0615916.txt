<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing container, primarily for motor oil, includes a 
conventionally-shaped container (10) which has an upwardly-tapered top 

surface. A valve (13) is provided at the outlet and a valve stem (12) is 
axially disposed in the container. The valve and valve stem have a 

bellowed actuating member (16) which is disposed in a cavity (19) at the 
container bottom and which, when depressed, opens the valve (13). A 

safety stem (11) is provided on the valve stem which engage said tapered 
top surface to prevent the valve and valve stem from falling out of the 

container after the container has been inverted and opened.
 

An alternate embodiment includes an upwardly extending neck 
incorporating a swivel valve which is actuated by a handle attached to 

the pivotable part of the neck.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dispensers for liquids, and is 
primarily intended for use by motorists in 'topping-up' the 
engine oil in motor cars. It has become customary for motorists to purchase containers 
of motor oil in single numbers, and maintain proper oil level 
in the crank case by adding oil when necessary. When it was 
necessary to add oil when no funnel or other tools were 
available, it was commonplace to spill oil on the motor, or on 
the hands. In accordance with the present invention, this 
spillage is avoided since, after removing a threadably engaged 
closure cap on the container, a secondary closure will prevent 
oil from escaping the container while it is being turned 
upside down and placed in the oil filler opening of the 
engine. The oil will only flow into the engine after the 
secondary closure is opened, thus preventing the chance of any 
hazardous and unwanted spill. As a result, funnels or other 
tools will not be required to dispense oil into the motor. The present invention relates to a new and spill-proof way of 
dispensing oil and other liquids using a conventionally-shaped 
container, and further using a threadably-engaged closure cap 
about the container opening, a secondary closure under the 
cap, functioning as a plug-shaped valve head attached to a 
push rod extending from the top to the bottom of the 
container. This valve can be extended out of the opening, 
thereby allowing for free flow of the liquid from the 
container, or by having a twist top container neck with 
slotted openings inside, so when the slots are aligned, the 
fluid will flow from the container. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:  Figure 1 is a full cut-a-way vertical side view of a 
first embodiment of the present invention, in which the 
internal hull of an oil container is exposed; Figure 2 is a view from beneath of the container of Fig. 
1; Figure 3 is a full cut-a-way vertical side view of a 
second embodiment in which the internal hull of the 
container is exposed, showing two sections of the 
container, and where they are connected; Figure 4 is an enlarged detail view of the circled part 
of Fig. 3, showing how the two sections are connected; 
and, Figure 5 is a plan view corresponding to Fig. 3, showing 
the internal openings, or slots, of the twist top 
container neck, and showing how the quadrant shaped 
openings can be twisted into open or closed positions by 
aligning the two openings so a through

<CLAIMS>
A dispenser for dispensing liquids, comprising: 

a) a container having an outlet opening; 
b) a valve stem disposed in said container, said 
valve stem at a first end having a valve which normally closes 

said outlet opening and at a second end being connected to the 
container; and 
c) means for flexibly connecting said second end 
to the container at a location remote from said outlet opening 

and having interior portions thereof which hold said second end 
of said valve stem, said flexibly connecting means serving as an 

actuator, when moved, for moving said valve via said valve stem 
to a position in which the outlet opening is at least partially 

unobstructed by said valve to permit dispensing from the 
container. 
The dispenser according to Claim 1, further 
including means for preventing said valve and valve stem from 

falling out of the container after the container has been 
inverted and opened, said means comprising a safety stem 

angularly disposed on said valve stem in a direction toward an 
upwardly tapered top wall of the container and spaced therefrom 

when the valve is in a closed position, such that upon moving 
the valve to an open position the safety stem engages said 

tapered top wall and prevents said valve and stem from falling 
out of the container when the container is inverted. 
The dispenser according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein said second end of said valve stem is located within a 

recess in said container, said recess being outwardly open at an 
access position. 
The dispenser according to Claim 3, further 
comprising a seal disposed over said access opening. 
The dispenser according to Claim 4, further 
comprising a pull tab on said seal. 
The dispenser according to any preceding Claim, 
wherein said means for flexibly connecting said second end of 

said valve stem to said container comprises a bellows formed at 
said location. 
The dispenser according to Claim 7, further 
comprising grooves on said second end of said valve stem which 

are engaged by interior portions of said bellows. 
A dispenser for dispensing liquids, comprising: 

a) a container having an outlet opening at the 
outer end of an upwardly-extending swivel neck; 
b) a valve in said swivel neck, said valve 
usually being closed and comprising a pair of apertured plates 

across said neck; and 
c) an actuator accessible from outside the 
container and movable to swivel said neck which carries one of 

 
said apertured plates to align the apertures and so open said 

valve to permit dispensing from the container. 
The dispenser according to any preceding Claim, 
further comprising a threaded cap and threads surrounding said 

outlet opening to receive said cap. 
The features herein described, or their 
equivalents, in any patentably novel selection.
