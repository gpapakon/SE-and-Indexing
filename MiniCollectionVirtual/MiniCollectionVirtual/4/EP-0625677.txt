<ABSTRACT>
A smoke and vapour-exhausting apparatus in particular 
for cooking stoves comprises a collecting element for 

smokes and vapours and means for supporting and moving 
the collecting element in a vertical direction, said 

means being adapted to enable the collection element to 
be selectively located for operation at variable-height 

positions within predetermined minimum and maximum 
heights.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a smoke and vapour-exhausting
apparatus, in particular for cooking stoves,
of the kind comprising the features recited in the preamble of claim 1.It is known that cooking of food on stoves gives rise to
the formation of smokes or vapours (also referred to as
fumes) which are sometimes very disagreeable and the
elimination of which is usually attempted through the
use of collecting and exhausting appliances of different
types.For example, hoods or coverings disposed over the area
where said smokes and vapours are produced may be
provided, said coverings involving a natural or forced
suction action by means of appropriate fans conveying
all fumes towards a dicharge pipe or a flue. The use of
forced-suction collecting elements provided with filters
is also known, said elements reintroducing the filtered
air into the inner environment, which will present the
use of exhaust tubes discharging the fumes to the
surrounding atmosphere.The above described apparatuses however, are not always
quite efficient because, as they are located over the
cooking stoves at a rather important distance therefrom
in order to leave an appropriate working region above
the stove itself, said apparatuses sometimes enable
smokes and vapours to escape to a greater or lesser
degree outside the region included between the
collecting elements or hoods and the area where said
smokes and vapours are produced.Patent documents EP 521 810, EP 146 722 and DE-U-91 01
894 disclose each a vapour extracting hood provided with
supporting and moving means adapted to enable said
collecting hood to be selectively disposed for operation
and varable-hight locations above the area where the
smokes and vapours are produced.However, in the known art it often happens that a
regular smoke and vapour flow towards the hood and the
discharge pipe is hardly created, while, on the
contrary, there is the occurrence of vortices, irregular  
and return flows of smokes and vapours that therefore
invade the whole room where the stove is located.Under this situation the technical task underlying the
present invention is to provide a smoke and vapour-exhausting
apparatus, in particular for cooking stoves,
capable of substantially eliminating the above
drawbacks. Within the scope of this technical task it is
an important aim of the invention to devise an apparatus
capable of upwardly drawing and evacuating smokes and
vapours with the greatest efficiency.The technical task mentioned and the aim specified are
substantially achieved by an
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A smoke and vapour-exhausting apparatus, in
particular for cooking stoves, comprising a hood (2) for collecting

said smokes and vapours, a
pipe length (5) for conveying said smokes and vapours,

located uppermost with respect to said hood (2),
means (3) for supporting and moving

said collecting hood (2) in a vertical direction,
which support and movement means (3) is adapted to

enable said collecting hood (2) to be selectively
disposed for operation at variable-height locations

between predetermined minimum and maximum heights above
the area (4) where said smokes and vapours are produced,

characterized in that at least
one division element (15) for said smokes and vapours

is provided between said hood (2) and conveying pipe
length (5), which division element comprises a plurality

of conveying channels (15b)
substantially extending parallel to one another and

adapted to divide the overall flow of said fumes into a
plurality of partial flows.
An apparatus according to claim 1, in which said
support and movement means (3) comprises a plurality of

supporting cables (8) engaged at one end thereof to said
collecting element (2), idler pulleys (9) for said

supporting cables (8), and at least one counterweight
(11) engaged to a second end of said supporting cables

(8).
An apparatus according to claim 1, in which said
support and movement means (3) comprises:


at least one pair of fixed guide rails (12), directed
vertically;
coupling members (13) to be slidably coupled to said
guide rails (12), integral with said collecting element

(2); and
engaging elements (14a) interposed between said guide
rails (12) and slidable coupling members (13) for

selectively locking the coupling members themselves to
said guide rails.
An apparatus according to claim 1, in which said
support and movement means (3) comprises:


at least one pair of fixed guide rails (12), directed
vertically;
coupling members (13) to be slidably coupled to said 
guide rails (12), integral with said collecting element

(2);
a plurality of supporting cables (8) engaged at one
end thereof to said collecting element (2);
idler pulleys (9) for said supporting cables (8); and
at least one counterweight (11) engaged to a second
end of said supporting cables (8).
An apparatus according to claim 1, in which
provision in made for

a discharge pipe (7) exhibiting an end portion (6)
slidably coupled to said pipe length (5) to enable said

hood (2) to be displaced between said predetermined
minimum and maximum heights.
An apparatus according to claim 5, in which said conveying channels (15b) are
defined by partitions (15a) provided within the division element (15).
An apparatus according to claim 6, in which a
substantially funnel-shaped interconnecting pipe

portion (5a) is provided between said division element
(15) and conveying pipe length (5).
An apparatus according to claim 5, in which a
plurality of dividing webs (16) is provided within said

hood (2), which webs (16) define conveying channels
adapted to divide the overall flow of said fumes into a

plurality of partial flows.
