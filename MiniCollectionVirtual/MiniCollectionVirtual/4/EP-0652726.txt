<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a process for imaging the interior of bodies, consisting of the following steps: provision of an optical imaging system consisting of a camera (20, 51) and a monitor (25); allocation of a spatial data field to the body (52) in a given position; continuous detection of the spatial position of the camera (20, 51); continuous calculation of a display of the data field corresponding to the current viewing angle of the camera (20, 51); simultaneous or alternate display of the optical image and the data field on the monitor (25). The process is characterized in that an endoscope (21, 61) is fitted upstream of the camera (20, 51) and a calibration process is repeated, consisting in causing one or more characteristic points on the data field to correspond to the appurtenant optical display on the screen (25) by means of a user input operation. The invention also pertains to a device for implementing the process.

Method for the representation of the interior 
of bodies, having the following steps: 


preparation of an optical imaging system 
comprising a camera (20) and a monitor (25); 
association of a spatial data field with the body 
which is in a specific location; 
continuous detection of the spatial position of 
the camera (20); 
continual computation of a representation of the 
data field that corresponds to the respective 

current viewing angle of the camera; 
simultaneous or alternative representation of the 
optical image and of the data field on the monitor 

(25); 
 
characterised in that an endoscope (21) is connected in 

relation to the camera (20), in that calibration is 
carried out repeatedly, the calibration consisting in 

bringing one or more characteristic dots of the data 
field into line with the associated optical 

representation on the screen by means of an inputting 
process carried out by the user. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a representation obtained from an image-forming 

method, such as X-ray tomography, nuclear spin 
tomography, ultrasonic representation or the like, is 

used as the data field. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a three-dimensional reconstruction, which is 

obtained from video images taken previously, is used as 
the data field. 
Method according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the three-dimensional reconstruction is obtained 

from one single video image, associated with which 
there is a distance measurement, for example, using 

ultrasound.  
 
Method according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the three-dimensional reconstruction consisting of 

a plurality of video images is obtained by means of 
stereometric analysis. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the inputting process consists in 

freezing the combined representation of the optical 
image and the data field at an instant which is 

determined by the user and in that individual dots of 
the data field can be displaced on the screen in this 

representation which is held fast. 
Method according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the displacement of the dots is effected by means 

of a computer mouse. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that electronic elimination of 

distortion of the optical system of the endoscope (21) 
is effected by directing the endoscope at a test image 

which consists of regularly arranged dots or lines, in 
that an evaluation is carried out with a pattern-identification 

procedure and in that a distortion-elimination 
function for the optical system of the 

endoscope is calculated from the data thus obtained. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the endoscope is used to examine 

a patient to whom a location sensor is secured in order 
to compensate for changes in location of the patient. 
Arrangement for carrying out a method 
according to one of the claims 1 to 9, having the 

following elements: 

a camera (20) having an endoscope (21) secured 
thereto; 
a location sensor (22) secured to the camera (20) 
or to the endoscope (21) respectively; 
a monitor (25) for the representation of the 
optical image, taken by the camera (20), together  

 
with a spatial data field; 
a computer (24) having a memory for the data field 
and means for detecting the position of the 

location sensor (22); 
means for determining the location of the body in 
space; 
 
characterised in that means are provided that make it 

possible for the user to bring dots of the data field 
into line with corresponding dots of the optical image 

by displacement of at least one dot of the data field 
on the screen and thus to improve the correspondence 

between the rest of the representation of the data 
field and the optical image. 
Arrangement according to claim 10, 
characterised in that a further location sensor (72) is 

provided that is fixedly attached to a patient who is 
to be examined.
