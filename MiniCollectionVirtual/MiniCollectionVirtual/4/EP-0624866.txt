Frequency analysis method

in which window functions are used to extract overlappingly
succeeding blocks of sampled values from

an input signal present in a time-discrete fashion
in the form of sampled values, whereupon the blocks

thus evaluated using the window functions are
subjected to Fourier transformation for the purpose

of generating a set of coefficients,
wherein such a block of the input signal is
respectively evaluated using a set of different,

symmetrical window functions of identical length to

generate a set of blocks of sampled values weighted
with the respective window functions, the window

functions differing from one another in such a way
that their Fourier transforms have different

bandwidths, and

characterized that each of the simultaneously
generated blocks of windowed sampled values of a set

is subjected to a dedicated Fourier transformation
in such a way that


for each of the simultaneously generated blocks
at least one coefficient is calculated which is

assigned the bandwidth of the Fourier transforms of
this window function, and
that the coefficients are chosen such that with
reference to their bandwidth the frequency bands 

bands assigned to them overlap one another only
slightly or are separated from one another only

slightly.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that

the window functions are sinx/x functions whose zero
crossings are situated at sampling instants of

sampled values, resulting in a temporal resolution
corresponding to the mutual spacing of the zero

crossings, the temporal resolution being inversely
proportional to twice the bandwidth of the Fourier

transforms.
Frequency analysis method according to Claim 2,
characterized in that


the Fourier transformation is a discrete fast
Fourier transformation (FFT) which delivers in the

frequency range a number of coefficients
corresponding to the number of input values in the

temporal range and whose distance on the frequency
axis corresponds to the sampling frequency divided

by the length of the transformation and whose
bandwidth is prescribed by the window function, and
in that of these only those coefficients are
selected by means of which it is possible, in

conjunction with coefficients available in a time-parallel
fashion from the set of further fast

Fourier transformations on the same block of sampled
values using different window functions, to

construct a cascade of band filters in the case of
other centre frequencies, so that the resulting

frequency bands adjoin one another essentially 
without gaps.
Frequency analysis method according to Claim 2,
characterized in that


in order to improve the selection properties of the
cascade of band filters thus produced, the length of

the different window functions of a set can also be
a multiple of the transformation length,
it being the case that before the transformation the
multiplicity of input values is reduced again to the

transformation length by division and additive
superposition of the already windowed input values

(polyphase addition).
Frequency analysis method according to Claim 2,
characterized in that


the selected coefficients are calculated from the
input signal by means of a second order Goertzel

algorithm.
Frequency analysis method according to one of Claims
1 to 5, characterized by


an iterative method for determining the discrete
centre frequencies and band limits for the purpose

of defining the window functions, which method
comprises the following steps:


setting a running frequency variable (f
centre
) to a
start frequency (f
top
) which lies on the frequency
raster chosen by the length of the Fourier

transformation; 
displacing the running frequency variable (f
centre
)
by one step (df) on the frequency raster;
determining the bandwidth resulting from a given,
nonlinear function of the centre frequency; and
repeating the iteration until a band limit of the
band belonging to the running frequency variable

(f
centre
) coincides with a band limit of a previously
determined band.
Frequency analysis method according to Claim 6,
characterized in that


the given, nonlinear function is the relationship
between the centre frequency and the frequency group

width.
