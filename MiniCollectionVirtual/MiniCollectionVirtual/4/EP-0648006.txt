<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ac electric machines 
and more specifically to a stator of an ac electric 
machine. Widely known in the prior art at present is a 
stator of an ac electric machine (EP 0271604), having a 
cylindrical magnetic circuit which occupies a set phase 
zone and the slots of which internally accommodate coil 
groups of two three-phase windings which are star 
and delta-connected and provided with three leads designed 
for connection to an external mains. In a known stator a star-connected three-phase 
winding is a main one, while a delta-connected three-phase 
winding being an auxiliary one has a substantially 
lesser power (of up to two orders of magnitude). Both 
windings are connected in parallel to a supply source 
and are accommodated in common slots of the magnetic 
circuit. The coil groups of like phases of the three-phase 
windings are displaced relative to one another 
in the cross-section of the stator through 90 electrical 
degrees and their like leads are connected to different 
bus bars of a three-phase mains, that is the time-phase 
displacement comprises 120 deg. The embodiment and disposition of the three-phase 
windings described hereinbefore is mainly intended 
for compensating odd harmonics of an electromagnetic 
field of the electric machine stator. From this standpoint 
the characteristics of the stator electromagnetic field 
are upgraded, however this known design solution has 
no effect on the process of conversion of the electric 
energy into mechanical energy (operation in motor mode)  
 
and vice versa (operation in generator mode), as well as 
it also has no effect on such functions of an electric 
machine as speed-torque characteristics, torque ratio, 
current ratio, etc. It is known that the electromagnetic force F in an 
ac electric machine applied to bus bars of the rotor 
depends on a magnitude of the vector of current I 
passing through the rotor bus bar and induced according 
to the electromagnetic induction law by the magnetic 
flux of one phase of the stator on a magnitude of the 
vector of the magnetic induction B of the magnetic 
field of another phase of the stator, as well as on a 
geometric angle between said vectors which follows 
from Ampere's formula: 
 
where l is an active length of the rotor bus bar. Thus, the optimum conditions for conversion of 
electric energy into mechanical energy and vice versa 
will take place with the availability of geometric 
orthogonality and phase coincidence of vectors of the 
rotor current and stator
