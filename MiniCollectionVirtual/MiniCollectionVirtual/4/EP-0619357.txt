<DESCRIPTION>
As modern electronic circuit boards evolve 
toward increased circuit and component densities, 
thorough board cleaning after soldering becomes a more 
important criterion. Current industrial processes for 
soldering electronic components to circuit boards 
involve coating the entire circuit side of the board 
with flux and thereafter passing the flux-coated board 
over preheaters and through molten solder. The flux 
cleans the conductive metal parts and promotes solder 
fusion. Commonly used solder fluxes generally consist 
of rosin, either used alone or with activating 
additives, such as amine hydrochlorides or oxalic acid 
derivatives. After soldering, which thermally degrades part of 
the rosin, the flux-residues are often removed from the 
circuit boards with an organic solvent. The 
requirements for such solvents are very stringent. 
Defluxing solvents should have the following 
characteristics: a low boiling point, be nonflammable, 
have low toxicity and have high solvency power, so that 
flux and flux-residues can be removed without damaging 
the substrate being cleaned. While boiling point, flammability and solvent 
power characteristics can often be adjusted by 
preparing solvent mixtures, these mixtures are often  
 
unsatisfactory because they fractionate to an 
undesirable degree during use. Such solvent mixtures 
also fractionate during solvent distillation, which 
makes it virtually impossible to recover a solvent 
mixture with the original composition. On the other hand, azeotropic mixtures, with 
their constant boiling points and constant compositions, 
have been found to be very useful for these 
applications. Azeotropic mixtures exhibit either a 
maximum or minimum boiling point and they do not 
fractionate on boiling. These characteristics are also 
important when using solvent compositions to remove 
solder fluxes and flux-residues from printed circuit 
boards. Preferential evaporation of the more volatile 
solvent mixture components would occur, if the mixtures 
were not azeotropic and would result in mixtures with 
changed compositions, and with attendant less-desirable 
solvency properties, such as lower rosin flux solvency 
and lower inertness toward the electrical components 
being cleaned. The azeotropic character is also 
desirable in vapor degreasing operations, where 
redistilled solvent is generally employed for final 
rinse cleaning. In summary, vapor defluxing and degreasing systems 
act as a still. Unless the solvent composition 
exhibits a constant boiling point, i.e.,
