<ABSTRACT>
Modified polyethylene terephthalate polymers, particularly suitable for making carbonated drinks or mineral water bottles by injection (stretch) blow moulding, include a small proportion (from 0.007 to 0.08 mole %) of residues of a polyfunctional hydroxyl compound such as pentaerythritol as a chain branching agent and have (after solid phase polymerisation processing) melt viscosity values of from 300 to 1050 Pa.s (3000 to 10500 Poise) at 295  DEG C (approximately Intrinsic Viscosity 0.6 to 0.9). The polymers also preferably include from 0.5 to 5 mole % of residues derived from a chain orientation disrupting monomer such as i

<DESCRIPTION>
 Modified Polyester PolymersThis invention relates to modified polyethylene terephthalate polymers and copolymers, to a method of making such polymers and copolymers, in particular which enables an improved manufacturing process, to the use of such polymers in the manufacture of bottles and bottle preforms, particularly as made by and in injection blow moulding processes, and to carbonated soft drinks and mineral water bottles and preforms for such bottles made using such polymers.Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is made by the condensation polymerisation of a terephthalate material with an ethylene glycol material, with the net elimination of a low molecular weight hydroxylic species. The simplest chemistry is the direct polyesterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with the elimination of water. Other routes, differing in the detail of the chemistry include those starting from dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol, with the elimination of methanol initially and subsequently ethylene glycol and water or from low molecular weight oligomers compositionally approximating to bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate with the elimination of ethylene glycol and water. Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate is nominally the diester of one mole of terephthalic acid with two moles of ethylene glycol. The material typically used in PET manufacture is made by esterifying terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol at a molar ratio of about 1:1.05 to 1:1.7, typically 1:1.15 to 1:3 - and removing from about 1.5 to 2 molar parts of water. This yields a mixture of compounds believed to include mono-esters the true bis(2-hydroxy- ethyl) terephthalate diester and low molecular weight oligomers. The mean degree of polymerisation (here referring to the number of ethylene terephthalate residues in the oligomer) of the mixture is typically from 2.5 to 5. This oligomer is commonly referred to as bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate as if it were a true monomer or simply using the term 'monomer'.Although water may be nominally absent, in fact, it will usually be present as residual moisture in the starting materials 

or as generated by reactions. Current techniques for the manufacture of high molecular weight polyethylene terephthalate polymers e.g. for use in the manufacture of carbonated drinksy (CSD) bottles, carbonated or still mineral water bottles, or highly oriented film products, use a polymerisation method which includes an initial melt phase polymerisation, which usually generates an intermediate
