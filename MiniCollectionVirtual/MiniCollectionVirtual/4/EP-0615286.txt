<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device is provided in which a contact is 
very simply formed on conductive material for capacitive 

coupling prevention. Two silicon substrates are bonded 
through a silicon oxide film. And a trench extending to the 

silicon oxide film is formed in one of silicon substrates so 
as to isolate between plural circuit elements from each other, 

and islands for circuit element formation are compartmently 
formed by the trench. A silicon oxide film is formed on an 

outer periphery portion of the islands for circuit element 
formation. Furthermore, an island for capacitive coupling 

prevention is formed by the silicon substrate between the 
islands for circuit element formation and is applied thereto 

to be maintained in an electric potential of constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device provided with a region for isolation between
semiconductor elements, particularly a isolation region given
by an insulator or dielectric material.Conventionally, there is a dielectric isolation method
given by a trench in a bipolar integrated circuit integrating
bipolar transistors. In this method, a dielectric isolation
portion is given by a capacitor structure in construction.
Thus, interference between circuits often becomes an issue.
Accordingly, there is offered a method in which conductive
material is buried in a trench so as to fix an electric
potential of constant thereby to prevent capacitive coupling
and to prevent interference between circuits (for instance,
Japanese Patent Publication Laid-open No. 3-148852).Incidentally, for an isolation region in the trench
portion flatness of an upper portion of the trench must be
originally ensured. However, an electrode drawing portion
becomes necessary because a contact may not be directly formed
on the buried conductive material in the trench. Thus, it is
difficult to ensure the flatness. In addition, it is
considered to form the trench portion widely. However, it 
takes an hour to fully bury the trench portion with conductive
material. It is undesirable that a surplus amount of
conductive material accumulated on the semiconductor substrate
is also increased to facilitate lowering of flatness of the
trench upper portion more and more and to increase etching
time. Furthermore, it has been required to increase masking
process for forming a contact on the buried conductive
material. There has been a semiconductor device in which a
plurality of islands are isolated by trenches having an insulation
layer and semiconductor layer buried therein
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 4-239154). However,
in this semiconductor device, since the bottom side
of the semiconductor layer buried in the insulating layer
has a low concentration, potentials of both the semiconductor
layer and the adjacent island are influenced by each
other.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
semiconductor device capable of very easily forming a contact
on conductive material for capacitive coupling prevention.According to the present invention, this object is
solved by the advantageous measures indicated in claim 1. It is an advantage of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device in which plural circuit
elements are formed in a monocrystalline semiconductor layer
provided on an insulation film,
