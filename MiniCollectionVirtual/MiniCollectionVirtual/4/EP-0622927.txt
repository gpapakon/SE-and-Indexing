<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a local 
area network including a data transmission apparatus and a 
communication path management method therefor. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus 
for and a method of generating communication protocol for 
establishing a communication path between a main system and 
a plurality of peripheral devices. The present invention 
has particular applicability in an Open Systems 
Interconnection (OSI) communication protocol system. In conventional communication networks, the transfer 
of data from one location to another over a communication 
path occurs in one of two manners. The first manner 
requires that a communication path be established as data 
is about to be transferred and the second manner requires 
no communication path be established because a path has 
been established well beforehand. A conventional 
communication control mode for a communication network 
system of the former data transmission type is disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 49540/1986. This system 
will be described with reference to Figs. 6 to 8. Fig. 6 illustrates a block diagram of a conventional 
communication network system including a data transmission  
 
apparatus 1, a communication network 2 connected to the 
data transmission apparatus 1, task program devices 3a, 3b 
which exist as or execute task programs in the data 
transmission apparatus 1, and a communication protocol 
processor 6 coupled to the task program devices 3a and 3b 
and the communication network 2 for processing the 
communication protocol of the network 2. Peripheral 
devices or systems 7a, 7b (which may be either hardware or 
software) are coupled to the other end of the communication 
network 2 for communicating with the data transmission 
apparatus 1. In this specification, the terms "task 
program" and "task program device" are interchangeable and 
are defined simply as sources of data communications. For 
example, the task program devices may simply be software or 
may be hardware units capable of executing software. The network 2 is physically connected to the data 
transmission apparatus 1 and the peripheral devices 7a, 7b 
by, for example, a pair of cables or a single optical 
cable. Software initializes the communication path which 
links the data transmission apparatus 1 and the peripheral 
devices 7a, 7b via the network 2. The transmission of data 
between the data transmission apparatus 1 and the 
peripheral devices 7a, 7b is made after establishing a 
comm
