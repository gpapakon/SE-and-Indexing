<ABSTRACT>
A multi-speed transmission has a hydraulic 
control system for establishing a plurality of forward 

drive ratios and a reverse drive ratio. Each drive ratio 
is established by the engagement of a fluid operated 

friction device (22,24,26,40,52), such as a clutch or 
brake. The engagement timing of each friction device is 

controlled in part by an accumulator (112,114,116). Each 
accumulator is disposed to accommodate friction devices, 

such that five forward speed and one reverse speed 
require only a maximum of three accumulators.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transmissions and 
controls. More particularly, this invention relates to 
transmissions having fluid operated friction devices and 
to a hydraulic control system therefor including 
accumulators for establishing the engagement time of each 
friction device. Automatic shifting power transmissions, both 
planetary and countershaft type, have hydraulic controls 
systems for effecting the establishment and disestablishment 
of power paths through the gearing in the transmission. The 
power paths include fluid operated friction devices, such as 
clutches and brakes, for connecting the appropriate gear 
components to the power source; that is, the prime mover, or 
to ground; that is, transmission housing. When a ratio interchange is being made, at 
least one friction device is being engaged to establish 
the power path. Hydraulic timing devices are used to 
control the engagement rate of the on-coming friction 
device. The timing devices include accumulators which 
are filled with hydraulic fluid simultaneously with a 
fluid motor of the friction device. These accumulators 
require space within the transmission and the 
installation of pistons, springs and covers at assembly. There are accumulators in the form of self-contained 
assemblies that can reduce the assembly time and cost. These 
devices do not reduce the number of accumulators nor the space 
required. As a general rule, each friction device has an 
accumulator, such that six friction devices require six 
accumulators. DE-A-1530645 describes a system in accordance 
with the preamble of claim 1. A hydraulic control system in accordance with 
the present invention is characterised over DE-A-1530645 
by the features specified in the characterising portion 
of Claim 1.  
 In order to improve the space utilisation in 
power transmissions, the present invention uses each 
accumulator at least twice. The accumulators are used to 
provide timing control during friction device engagement. 
The reuse of the accumulator is separated by at least one 
ratio step or ratio interchange, and the same accumulator 
is not used for both forward and reverse drive 
initiation. For example, one accumulator is filled 
during the initiation of forward drive and again during a 
4-5 ratio interchange. Another accumulator is filled 
during the initiation of reverse drive and again during a 
2-3 ratio interchange. Yet another accumulator is filled 
during both a 1-2 ratio interchange and a 3-4 ratio 
interchange. Other combinations are possible, as
