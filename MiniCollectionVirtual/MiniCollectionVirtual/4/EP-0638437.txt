<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for discharging sets of copies or parts of such sets in 
stapled or unstapled condition.

 
Those sets of copies or parts of such sets which are made from one and the same set of 

originals and which are required to be stapled are stapled only if the measured thickness 
of the first collected set of copies or part of such set is thinner than a predetermined 

thickness measurement X₁ and if the measured thickness of subsequent collected sets 
of copies or parts of such sets is thinner than a predetermined thickness measurement 

X
v
 which is greater than the first thickness measurement X₁.
 

Parts of sets of copies made from one and the same original set and required to be 
unstapled are discharged when the measured thickness of collected parts of the first 

collected set of copies is equal to a predetermined thickness measurement Y₁ and when 
the measured thickness of collected corresponding parts of subsequent sets of copies is 

thinner than a predetermined thickness measurement Y
v
 which is greater than the first 
thickness measurement Y₁.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of processing sets of copies each corresponding 
to a set of originals, wherein successively a number of copy sheets associated with a set 
of copies is stacked at a collection point and wherein said stack of copies can be 
processed in a first manner in accordance with a first criterion when said stack has a 
thickness less than a first predetermined thickness measurement and in a second 
manner when said stack has a thickness equal to said first predetermined thickness 
measurement. 
The invention also relates to apparatus for processing sets of copies successively 
delivered by a copying machine from a set of originals, comprising measuring means for 
measuring the thickness of delivered sets of copies, and control means which set the 
processing means to a first procedure in response to a thickness measured by the 
measuring means less than a predetermined first thickness measurement and which set 
the processing means to a second procedure in response to a thickness measured by 
the measuring means equal to or greater than said predetermined first thickness 
measurement. 
A method and apparatus of this kind are known from US patent 4 878 656, which 
describes an apparatus for stapling a stack of copy sheets, which operates in 
dependence on the measured thickness of the stack of copy sheets for stapling, in such 
manner that stacks which are too thick are not stapled. Since the measured thicknesses 
of different sets of copies made from one and the same set of originals may differ from 
one another, e.g. due to tolerance differences in respect of the thicknesses of the copy 
sheets and 
errors occurring during measurement, this known apparatus has the disadvantage that 
these sets of copies sometimes are stapled and sometimes are not stapled if the 
thickness of the stacks of copy sheets for stapling is in the region of the thickness below 
which stapling is carried out and above which it is not. The object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus of the type 
referred to in the preamble without such disadvantage. 
In a method of the type referred to in the preamble, to this end, according to the 
invention, the successively formed stacks of copies each corresponding to the same set 
of originals are processed in the first manner in accordance with a second 
supplementary criterion when the stack of copies first formed in succession is as thick as 
or thinner than a second predetermined thickness measurement, which second  
 
thickness measurement is

comprises stapling the copies stacked at the collection point (21) and then removing the 

stapled copies from the collection point (21) and in that the second manner comprises 
removing the collected copies (67') from the collecting point (21) unstapled.
