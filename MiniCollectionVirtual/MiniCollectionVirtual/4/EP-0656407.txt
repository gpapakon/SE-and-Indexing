<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording liquid. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a recording
liquid of a black color type suitable for ink-jet recording.A so-called ink-jet recording method has been put
into practical use in which liquid droplets of a recording
liquid containing a water-soluble colorant, e.g., a direct
dye or an acid dye, are issued from a minute ejection orifice
to conduct recording.With respect to the recording liquid, it is required
to be stably ejectable over a long period of time and to
rapidly fix to recording papers for general business use,
e.g., paper for PPCs (plain-paper copiers) such as
electrophotographic paper, and fanfold paper (continuous
paper for computers, etc.), to give a print in which the
printed characters are of good quality, that is, the printed
characters should be free of blurring and have clear
contours. The recording liquid is also required to have an
excellent storage stability. Therefore, solvents usable in
the recording liquid are severely restricted.Colorants used for the recording liquid are necessary
to meet the requirements such that they have sufficient
solubility in the solvents which are restricted as described 
above, that they are capable of stably ejecting the recording
liquid over a long period of time, that they are stable even
when they are stored for a long period of time, that they can
provide printed images having a high density, and that they
have excellent water-resistance and light-resistance.
However, it has been difficult to satisfy these various
requirements at the same time.In order to meet the above requirements, various
methods have been proposed in, for example, EP-A-0 290 384, EP-A-0 495 520, JP-A-55-144067,
JP-A-55-152747, JP-A-57-207660, JP-A-59-226072, JP-A-61-2776,

"JP-A" as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese
patent application), but recording liquids which sufficiently
meet commercial requirements have not been developed.The object of the present invention is to provide a
black recording liquid of a black color type (1) which is
capable of providing a good print quality when used in the
ink-jet recording
