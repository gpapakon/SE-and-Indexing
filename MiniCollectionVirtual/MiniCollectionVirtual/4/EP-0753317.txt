<ABSTRACT>
A needle point guard (10) assembly includes inner (12) and outer (14) 
housings disposed in nested relationship to one another to permit 

relative rotation therebetween. The proximal end walls of the inner and 
outer housings have apertures (34,35) each of which is dimensioned to 

slidably receive a needle (84). The apertures are disposed in the housings 
such that they are registered in one rotational orientation of 

the housings relative to one another to define a first opening that 
allows a needle to pass therethrough. The needle point guard assembly 

further includes a spring (58) for rotatably driving the housings 
relative to one another and a trigger (68) for selectively holding 

the inner housing with respect to the outer housing in a rotational 
orientation where the apertures define the first opening. The trigger 

moves out of interfering relationship between the inner housing and the 
outer housing when the sharp distal tip of the needle is withdrawn into the 

needle point guard assembly. In this condition, the spring will rotatably 
drive the housings into orientations where the apertures will not be 

substantially aligned so that the overlapping area is smaller than the first 
opening. The edges of the apertures will thus bind against the needle 

and prevent further movement of the needle point guard assembly either 
proximally or distally along the needle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a needle point guard assembly
that can be slid relative to the needle so the sharp distal tip of the needle
point is safely shielded inside the needle point guard assembly. When
the sharp distal tip of the needle is safely shielded inside the needle point
guard assembly, the needle point guard assembly lockingly engages the
needle to prevent re-exposure of the sharp distal needle tip.Sharp pointed needles are prevalent in health care institutions as
part of, e.g., a syringe or intravenous (IV) catheter. The point at the distal
end of the needle is used to penetrate tissue of a patient for administering
drugs, extracting body fluids or placing an IV catheter in the patient.
Accidental sticks of healthcare workers with a used needle may occur in
certain emergency or other situations where a used needle is not properly
disposed of. Such accidental needlesticks have become of greater
concern recently because of diseases such as acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, i.e. AIDS, and hepatitis that can be transmitted by
the body fluids of an infected patient. As a result, a number of devices
have been developed that purport to cover the sharp distal tip of a needle
after use. Although some of these needle shielding devices work, there is
still a need for needle shielding devices that are simple to use and
effectively lock the sharp distal tip of the needle in the shield (See in particular document WO 90/08564).It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a needle
shielding device that is simple to use and that effectively locks the sharp
distal tip of the needle in the shield.The needle point guard assembly of this invention includes nested
inner and outer housings each having a generally tubular cross-section
and a proximal end wall. The proximal end walls have apertures that
slidably engage the outer cylindrical surface of the needle. However, the
apertures are eccentrically disposed. The eccentricities of the apertures
in the proximal end walls are such that in a first rotational orientation of
the housings, the apertures register with one another. However, in a
second rotational orientation of the housing, the apertures only partly
register with one another. The needle point guard assembly further
includes a trigger for releasably holding the inner and outer housings in a
relative rotational position where the eccentric apertures are registered
with one another. The trigger may be moved out of interfering relationship
between the inner and outer housings to permit

A needle point guard assembly (10), comprising:

an outer housing (14) having a proximal end wall (52) defining a first aperture
(54) extending through said proximal end wall (52);
an inner housing (12) supported within the outer housing (14) and having a
proximal end wall (32) defining a second aperture extending therethrough,
a spring (58) operably connected to the inner housing (12) and the outer housing
(14);
characterised in that
an inner housing (12) rotatably supported within the outer housing (14) and
having a proximal end wall (32) defining a second aperture (34) extending therethrough,

such that in a first rotational orientation of the inner housing (12) and the outer housing
(14), the first aperture (54) and the second aperture (34) are in substantial alignment to

define a first opening, and such that in other rotational orientations of the inner housing
(12) and the outer housing (14), the first aperture (54) and the second aperture (34) define

an overlapping portion smaller than the first opening;
a trigger (68, 100, 200) is disposed in the inner housing (12) and movable
between a first position where the trigger (68, 100, 200) prevents relative rotation

between the outer housing (14) and the inner housing (12) in the first rotational
orientation, and a second position where the trigger (68, 100, 200) allows relative

rotation between the inner housing (12) and the outer housing (14).
The needle point guard assembly (10) of Claim 1, wherein the outer housing (14)
has a first longitudinal axis and the first aperture is aligned with the first longitudinal

axis. 
The needle point guard assembly (10) of Claim 2, wherein the inner housing (12)
has a second longitudinal axis and the first aperture (34) is offset from the second

longitudinal axis.
The needle point guard assembly of Claim 1 wherein the inner housing (12)
defines a third aperture (30) in the outer wall, the outer housing (14) defines a cut out

(150) in the outer wall and the trigger (100, 200) includes a trigger tang (101) that
extends through the third aperture (30) and into the cut out (150) in the first rotational

orientation.
The needle point guard assembly of Claim 4 wherein the trigger (100, 200)
includes a needle sensing tang (102) and a pivot tang (103) both of which are axially

offset from the trigger tang (101).
The needle point guard assembly of Claim 4 wherein the cut out (150) has a

having a radius of curvature which is the same as or less than the radius of curvature of
the cut out (150) surface.
