<ABSTRACT>
A developer station for an electro-photographic printer or copier has a developer chamber (12), a mixing chamber (13) and a developer station basin (14) connected to both chambers. Two developer mixture circuits are generated in the developer station, viz: one circuit to accept fresh toner and one for the actual development in a developer slit (18). A paddle roller (37) arranged in the developer station basin (14) generates a vortex in the mixture in the outlet region of the mixing chamber (13) which is enriched with fresh toner and is taken from the continuous developer mixture for the development process. The vortex essentially acts as a buffer store to compensate for heavy toner requirements in development and, in conjunction with the mixing chamber (13), for the tribo-electric activation of the developer mixture.

Developer station for an electrophotographic 
printing or copying machine for the development of charge 

images generated on a photoconductor (10), with 

a developer chamber (12) which is arranged in the 
region of the photoconductor (10),
 
the developer chamber (12) having: 


at least one developer roller (15/1, 15/2) with 
a clearance relative to the photoconductor (12), 

said clearance forming a developer gap (18); 
an access region (21) receiving developer mixture 
(11) having the printing-toner concentration; 
metering means (22, 23) for the developer mixture 
(11), the metered developer mixture being fed to 

the developer gap (18) via at least one of the 
developer rollers (15/1, 15/2) and excess 

developer divided off during metering being 
diverted out of the developer chamber (12) via an 

overflow channel (30); 
an outlet region (26) for diverting the developer 
mixture depleted as a result of the development 

out of the developer chamber (12), 
a mixing chamber (13) which is coupled to the overflow 
channel (30) and which has an access region 

(31) for fresh toner, the mixing chamber (13) 
containing means (33) which mix the excess developer 

with fresh toner and which thus produce an enriched 
developer mixture, 
a developer-station sump (14) which receives the 
enriched developer mixture from the mixing chamber  

 
(13) and which is coupled to the access region (21) 

and to the outlet region (26) of the developer 
chamber (12) and contains vortex-generating means 

(33, 37) via which a vortex swirling the depleted 
developer mixture together with the enriched 

developer mixture and intermediately storing it is 
generated in a space which is not occupied by the 

means (33, 37) and from which developer mixture 
having the printing-toner concentration is extracted 

and is fed to the developer chamber. 
Developer station according to Claim 1, with 
developer rollers which are designed as magnetic rollers 

(15/1, 15/2) having a direction of run in the developer 
gap (18) which is opposite to the direction of movement 

of the photoconductor (10). 
Developer station according to one of Claims 1 or 
2, with a shielding plate (19) separating the developer 

chamber (12) from the mixing chamber (13) and consisting 
of ferromagnetic material. 
Developer station according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, with lateral stripping elements (22) and a metering 

roller (23) which are arranged as metering means in a 
region of feed of the developer mixture to the developer 

gap (18). 
Developer station according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, with guide elements (34, 35) arranged in the mixing 

chamber (13) for the transverse intermixing of excess 
developer and fresh toner. 
Developer station according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, with guide elements (28), arranged in the outlet 

region (26) of the developer chamber (12), for the 
transverse intermixing of the depleted developer mixture, 

and with a stripping element (27) for the associated 

developer roller (15/1). 
Developer station according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, with a paddle roller (37), arranged in the developer-station 

sump (14), as a vortex and transport means, with 
paddle elements (39) arranged on its circumference.  

 
Developer station according to Claim 7, with a 
paddle roller (37) having an internal transport helix, 

which is designed in such a way that the developer 
mixture in the paddle roller (37) is moved in the axial 

direction relative to the paddle-roller middle. 
Developer station according to one of Claims 1 to 
8, with a device (32) sealing off the mixing chamber (13) 

relative to the photoconductor (10). 
Developer station according to one of Claims 1 to 
9, with a suck-off device (42) for toner dust. 
Developer station according to one of Claims 1 to 
10, with an electrically conductive two-component 

developer mixture (11) of toner particles with 
ferromagnetic carrier particles, which has a 

predetermined breakdown field-strength value. 
Developer station according to Claim 11, with 
means for generating in the developer gap (18) an 

electrical field, the field strength of which exceeds the 
breakdown field-strength value of the developer mixture. 
Process for the development of charge images 
generated on a photoconductor in an electrophotographic 

printing or copying machine, having the following 
features: 


in a developer-station sump (14), a mixture vortex 
(36) serving as a developer-mixture buffer store is 

generated by vortex-generating means (33, 37), in a 
space not occupied by the means (33, 37), from a 

developer mixture enriched with fresh toner and from 
a developer mixture depleted as a result of the 

development process, 
developer mixture is extracted continuously from the 
mixture vortex (36), 
the extracted developer mixture is transformed by 
metering (22, 23) into a mixture carpet of 

predetermined width and thickness, 
the mixture carpet is guided through a developer gap 
(18) adjacent to the photoconductor (10) and is 

introduced as a depleted developer mixture into the  
 

developer-station sump (14), 
if appropriate, the excess developer mixture 
separated during the metering (22, 23) is enriched 

with fresh toner in dependence on the toner consumption 
and is fed to the developer-station sump (14).
