<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a method and an installation for the production of pourable filling or cushioning material for packaging purposes, consisting of a hollow body (10) formed by folding and gluing a corrugated board, in which, in five process steps, a strip (2) stamped out from corrugated board is transported by means of a belt conveyor (3) to guiding means (12, 13) arranged one after another in series above the conveyor belt, to form-giving constructions (14) for forcible folding of the strip (2), to an adhesive-preparation installation (15) and to a guide (18) corresponding to the contour of the hollow body (10) to be produced, a hollow body (10) formed from two separately adjacent hollow spaces (11) being formed as end product.
