<ABSTRACT>
Stepwise magnetic device for the treatment of water flowing in a pipe capable, during a triaxial calcium carbonate crystallisation, of causing its at least partial conversion into nonscaling uniaxial aragonite crystal, including two pairs of permanent magnets arranged side by side on the pipe, one downstream of the other and both held by a magnetically insulated securing stirrup, the magnets of each pair being arranged facing on either side of the pipe along the same magnetic axis coinciding with a diameter of the said pipe so that the facing poles are of the same name, characterised in that the magnetic polarity of the facing magnets of the second pair is the opposite of that of the first pair upstream on the pipe.

Staged magnetic device for the treatment of
calcium carbonate molecules in water circulating in a

pipe (C) comprising two pairs of permanent magnets (2,
3) placed on the pipe (C), one at a sufficient distance

downstream from the other to create inverse
electrodynamic effects on the calcium carbonate atoms

and held in place by an attachment clamp (4), the
magnets on each pair (2, 3) being placed facing each

other on each side of the pipe (C) along the same
magnetic axis coincident with a diameter of the pipe

(C), such that the poles facing each other are of the
same type, the magnetic polarity of the magnets facing

the second pair (3) being opposite to the polarity of
the first pair (2) upstream on the pipe (C),

characterized in that the clamp (4) is magnetically
insulated.
Device according to the previous claim,
characterized in that the spacing along the pipe (C)

between the two pairs of magnets (2, 3) is at least a
few centimeters.
Device according to any one of the previous
claims, characterized in that the faces of the magnets

(2, 3) are concave to adapt to the radius of the said
pipe (C).
Device according to any one of the previous
claims, characterized in that each magnet (2, 3) in a

pair consists of a stack of magnetized strips, the
polarities of which are in series and in which the

stacking height is not less than one third of the width
of the magnets, and not more than this width.
Device according to any one of the previous
claims characterized in that the magnets (2, 3) are 

coated with an electrically insulating material
avoiding at least direct contact with the pipe (C).
Device according to any one of the previous
claims, characterized in that the magnets (2, 3) are

anisotropic ferrites.
Device according to the previous claim,
characterized in that the ferrites are of the oxonyte

290 type.
