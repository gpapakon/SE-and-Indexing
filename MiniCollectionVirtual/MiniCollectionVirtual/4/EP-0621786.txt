<ABSTRACT>
The invention features medicaments designed to lengthen the time an implanted organ (a xenograft) from a donor mammal survives in a recipient mammal of a discordant species prior to rejection. One such medicament is prepared by admixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substance hematopoietic stem cells, of the donor mammal for introduction into the recipient mammal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to organ transplantation.Organ procurement currently poses one of the major
problems in organ transplantation, as the number of
patients requiring transplants far exceeds the number of
organs available. Xenotransplantation may provide a
solution to this problem. Phylogenetically, non-human
primates are the most closely related species to humans
and might therefore represent the first choice as donors.
In 1969, Reemtsma et al., achieved the first successful
kidney human xenograft from a chimpanzee (Reetsma, K. et
al., 1964, Ann. Surg.160:384). However, the potential
utilization of primate donors is limited by insufficient
numbers, legal and ethical considerations, and the
potential for transmitting dangerous viral diseases.
Swine represent one of the few large animal species in
which breeding characteristics make genetic experiments
possible, making it possible to develop MHC homozygous
lines of miniature swine. Miniature swine can be
maintained at maximum adult weights of 200 to 300 lbs (about 440 to 660 kg) and
are anatomically and physiologically close to humans.
Therefore the organs of miniature swine might be
appropriate for use as xenografts for human beings of all
ages.Tolerance to self major histocompatibility (MHC)
antigens occurs during T cell maturation in the thymus
(McDuffie et al., 1988, J. Immunol.141:1840). Exposure
of the immune system to MHC antigens during ontogeny can
cause the immune system to lose reactivity to those
antigens, thus leaving the animal specifically tolerant
into adult life (Billingham et al., 1953, Nature172:603). Transplantation immunologists have sought
means of inducing tolerance in adult animals by 
production of lymphohematopoietic chimeras. The
induction of tolerance across MHC barriers in adult mice
by whole body irradiation (WBI) and bone marrow
transplantation (BMT) has been studied extensively in
murine models (Rayfield et al., 1983, Transplan. 36:183;
Mayumi et al., 1989, J. Exp. Med.169:213; Sykes et al.,
1988, Immunol. Today9:23).The use of MHC mismatched BMT as a means of
inducing tolerance to organ grafts can be accompanied by
several major disadvantages: the preparative regimen
involves lethal irradiation, with its inherent risks and
toxicities; clinical applicability is limited by the fact
that most potential recipients do not have an appropriate
MHC-matched donor, and BMT across MHC barriers causes
severe graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD). Removing the T
lymphocytes in allogeneic bone marrow inocula (Rodt et
al., 1971, Eur. J.

<CLAIMS>
Use of hematopoietic stem cells from a mammal of a second species in the
preparation of a medicament to be introduced into a recipient mammal of a first,

discordant species for inducing tolerance in said recipient mammal to a graft obtained
from a mammal of said second species, wherein, prior to introducing said hematopoietic

stem cells, an antibody capable of binding to natural killer cells of said recipient
mammal is introduced into said recipient mammal, wherein said mammal of a second

discordant species is swine.
Use of an antibody capable of binding to natural killer cells of a recipient
mammal of a first species in the preparation of a medicament to be introduced into said

recipient mammal for inducing tolerance in said recipient mammal to a graft obtained
from a mammal of a second, discordant donor species, wherein, subsequent to

introducing said antibody, hematopoietic stem cells of a mammal of said second species

are introduced into the recipient mammal so that said hematopoietic stem cells home to
a site in said recipient mammal, wherein said mammal of a second discordant species is

swine.
The use of any claim 1 or 2, further comprising use of donor species-specific
stromal tissue in the preparation of a medicament for administration to said mammal

before the introduction of said hematopoietic stem cells.
The use of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said swine is a miniature swine.
Use of donor species-specific stromal tissue of a primate of a second species in
the preparation of a medicament for inducing tolerance in a recipient primate of a first,

discordant species to a graft obtained from a primate of said second species, wherein, in
addition to stromal tissue, there are introduced into the recipient primate hematopoietic

stem cells of said second species, and an antibody capable of binding to natural killer
cells of said recipient primate. 
Use of donor species-specific hematopoietic stromal tissue in the preparation of
a medicament to be introduced into a primate for inducing tolerance in said primate to a

graft obtained from a mammal of a second species, wherein, additionally, primate bone
marrow cells of the second species are introduced into the primate so that said bone

marrow cells home to a site in said primate, and a graft obtained from said mammal of
said second species is introduced into said primate.
The use of any of claims 3 to 6, wherein said stromal tissue is fetal liver or
thymus.

stem cells.

claims 1 to 5, wherein said hematopoietic stem cells comprise bone marrow cells.
The use of any preceding claim, wherein the same mammal of the second
