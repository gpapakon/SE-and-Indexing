<ABSTRACT>
A security system to detect unauthorised removal of articles e.g. from a retail store, each article carrying a read/write tag, the security system comprising at least one point-of-sale apparatus (30) arranged to write specific data into (or erase specific data from) the tag to indicate that the article has been paid for, and a detector apparatus (40) for the or each exit of the store and arranged to read each tag to determine if the specific data has been written into (or erased from) the tag, and otherwise to initiate an alarm. The system also includes a refunds/returns detector apparatus (50) to read the tag of each article presented to it, to determine if the specific data has been written into (or erased from) the tag, and to erase (or write in) that data so that the article can be returned to stock.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Security SystemThis invention relates to a security system to detect unauthorised removal of articles from a restricted area, such as a retail store.Various systems have been adopted in retail outlets to combat fraud. In one type of system, a tag is attached to each article of clothing or other merchandise, and must be removed before the article is taken out of the store, otherwise a detector at the exit door senses the tag and sets off a general audible alarm. However, another form of fraud which is developing consists of the fraudster removing an article from one part of the store, then taking it to the "returns" desk and claiming a cash refund.We have now devised a security system of improved effectiveness and which is able to counter the above-described form of fraud.In accordance with this invention, there is provided a security system to detect unauthorised removal of articles from a restricted area such as a retail store, in which each article carries a read/write tag, the security system comprising at least one-point-of-sale or point-of-authorisation apparatus arranged to write specific data into (or erase specific data from) the tag to indicate that the article has been paid or its removal has otherwise been authorised, and a detector apparatus for the or each exit of said restricted area, said detector apparatus being arranged to read each tag to determine if said specific data has been written into (or erased from) the tag and otherwise to initiate an alarm.The security system preferably further comprises a refunds/returns detector apparatus arranged to read the tag of each article presented to it and to determine if said specific data has been written into (or erased from) the tag, and to erase (or write in) said data so that the article can be returned to stock.For example the point-of-sale apparatus may write into the tag data representing the date of sale and the actual price paid for the article. Then the refunds/returns detector erases 

the data and price-paid data.Preferably the security system also includes detector equipment for installing internally of the store (for example at passageways between departments or at stairways or escalators between floors) , this detector equipment being arranged to read the tags of articles passing them to determine whether any of those articles has not yet been paid for: preferably each such detector equipment is arranged to initiate a low level or discrete alarm, which is available to staff but not to customers. Such a detector may also be

<CLAIMS>
 CLAIMS
1) A security system to detect unauthorised removal of articles from a restricted area such as a retail store, in which each article carries a read/write tag, the security system comprising at least one point-of-sale or point-of- authorisation apparatus arranged to write specific data into (or erase specific data from) the tag to indicate that the article has been paid for, or its removal has otherwise been authorised, and a detector apparatus for the or each exit of said restricted area, said detector apparatus being arranged to read each tag to determine if said specific data has been written into (or erased from) the tag and otherwise to initiate an alarm.
2) A security system as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a refunds/returns detector apparatus arranged to read the tag of each article presented to it and to determine if said specific data has been written into (or erased from) the tag, and to erase (or write in) said data so that the article can be returned to stock.
3) A security system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the point-of-sale apparatus is arranged to write into each tag data representing the date of sale and the actual price paid.
4) A security system as claimed in claim 3, in which the refunds/returns detector apparatus is arranged to erase the date of sale and price-paid data from each tag.
5) A security system as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising at least one detector apparatus for installing internally of the restricted area and arranged to read each tag passing it to determine if said specific data has been written into (or erased from) the tag and otherwise to initiate a discrete alarm.
6) A security system as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising at least one detector apparatus arranged to be carried or worn by a number of staff and to read each nearby 


tag to determine if said specific data has been written into (or erased from) the tag and otherwise to initiate a discrete alarm.
7) A security system as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the or each exit or internal fixed detector apparatus comprises at least one ferrite core aerial arranged to act in a scanning mode.
8) A security system as claimed in claim 7, in which each said fixed-location detector comprises a plurality of ferrite core aerials for spacing apart along one transverse dimension of an exit or other passageway, and means for switching the aerials one-by-one in scanning mode.
9) A security system as claimed in claim 7, in which each fixed-location detector comprises a ferrite core aerial mounted to a drive apparatus which is arranged to displace the aerial in scanning mode across an exit or other passageway.
10) A detector apparatus comprising at least one ferrite core aerial arranged to act in a scanning mode relative to an exit or other passageway, to inductively couple with a tag passing through the exit or other passageway and read data from the tag.
