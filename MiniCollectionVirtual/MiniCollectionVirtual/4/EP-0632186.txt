<ABSTRACT>
Set retarding additives for hydraulic cement, for 
downhole use, are graft copolymers or terpolymers comprised 

of the condensation polymer product of a ketone, an aldehyde 
and a compound which introduces acid groups into the 

polymer, having grafted thereto acrylic acid, vinyl 
phosphonic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid or itaconic 

acid monomer, or one of the foregoing monomers and a second 
monomer of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to set retarded 
hydraulic cement compositions and their use for cementing 
subterranean zones in oil, gas and water wells. Hydraulic cement compositions are utilized for 
carrying out a variety of operations in oil, gas and water 
wells including, but not limited to, completion operations 
such as primary cementing and remedial operations such as 
squeeze cementing. Primary cementing involves the placement 
of a hydraulic cement composition into the annular space 
between the walls of a well bore and the exterior of a pipe 
such as casing disposed therein. The cement composition is 
pumped into the annular space and allowed to set into an 
annular cement sheath therein whereby the pipe is bonded to 
the walls of the well bore by the set cement. Squeeze cementing techniques usually involve the 
undesirable movement of oil, gas or water through small 
holes or cracks in pipe disposed in the well bore; holes, 
cracks, voids or channels in the annular cement sheath 
between the pipe and the well bore; annular spaces between 
the cement sheath and the pipe or the walls of the well bore 
and permeable zones or fractures in subterranean formations. 
Such holes, cracks, etc. are plugged by squeezing hydraulic 
cement compositions therein which harden and form 
impermeable plugs. Frequently, high temperatures are encountered in 
deep subterranean zones to be cemented which can cause  
 
premature setting of cement compositions, i.e. the 
compositions begin to set before there has been time to pump 
them to the zones to be cemented. In such cases, set 
retarding additives are included in the cement compositions 
to extend the setting times of the compositions so that 
adequate pumping time is provided in which to place or 
displace the compositions in desired subterranean zones. While a variety of cement set retarding additives 
have heretofore been developed and utilized, the additive 
frequently produce erratic results in cement compositions of 
different component make-up and/or cause premature gelation 
of cement compositions in the hostile high temperatures 
environments to which the cement compositions are subjected. 
The high temperatures referred to herein are temperature up 
to 250°F (121°C) and higher, and the gelation referred to is 
the abnormal increase in viscosity of a cement composition 
without a significant increase in compressive strength. The 
increase in viscosity makes the cement composition difficult 
or impossible to pump even though the cement composition
