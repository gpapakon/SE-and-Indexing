<DESCRIPTION>
Method of moulding a non-metallic component onto a metal barThis invention relates to a method of manufacturing a bushed bar by the moulding onto a prepared bar at one or more predefined moulding positions integral non-metallic collar or bush components.The term 'bar' is used in this specification for convenience of expression and unless specified as otherwise may, in its most general sense, mean not only an elongate solid object of round cross-section but also any non solid object, such as a tube or pipe, of any cross-sectional shape. Bars having such integrally moulded non-metallic components are often employed in situations where the bar is mounted on, and required to undertake restricted movements relative to, a body and the moulded non-metall c components may be required to permit the bar to undergo unlimited or restricted movement in one direction relative 

 to the body whilst restraining it from motion in another direction, often against considerable force. Such a non- metallic component may form a mounting bush for the bar and/or simply provide a collar for limiting axial motion relative to the body. Such restraint is due entirely to the strength of moulding bond between the non-metallic part and the bar but other manufacturing operations which require to be performed for technical and/or commercial reasons may conflict with and point towards compromising of an optimum bond.Although the uses of bushed bars are manifold and any may benefit from the method to be described herein this method is particularly applicable to, and will be described in relation to, a stabiliser bar of the type used in motor vehicles to counter body roll.Such a stabiliser, or anti-roll, bar is formed from steel rod having suitable torsion characteristics and mounted to the chassis of the vehicle by non-metallic components such as bushes of rubber or plastics material which are moulded integrally onto the bar at at least one, and usually a plurality of, predefined moulding positions along the bar.Such bushes serve to permit rotational motion of the bar about its longitudinal axis relative to the chassis, 

differential rotation along its length deriving torsional reaction forces to counter chassis roll.Such a stabiliser bar having at least one non-metallic component integrally moulded thereto is described in British Patent specification No. 2,239,440. In both the present and this aforementioned specifications, the term integrally is used in relation to the moulding to mean that the component is formed to its final shape

CLAIMS
1. A method of manufacturing a metal bar (20) having at least on non-metallic component (27) integrally moulded onto the bar a an individual moulding position (21, 21', 26) along the ba comprising cleaning the surface (24) of the bar, depositin surface protection material (25) on the bar, and moulding o the bar at each moulding position a said non-metalli component, and characterised by masking the surface of th cleaned bar, at each moulding position, about its peripher for an axial distance along the bar with a meltable materia (22, 22') prior to depositing said surface protection materia on the bar, and subjecting the bar and deposited surfac protection material to a temperature above the melting poin of the mask material to expose the unprotected bar surface a each moulding position (26) prior to moulding on the bar sai non-metallic component.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 characterised by masking th surface (24) of the cleaned bar (20) at each moulding positio (21) by a substantially complete loop (22) of self-adhesiv tape of the meltable material, the width of the tape definin the axial length of the moulding position.
3. A method as claimed in claim 2 characterised by masking th surface with a tape having a fiase of polyvinyl chloride film. 


 4. A method as claimed in claim 3 characterised by masking the surface with a tape bearing a low tack thermoplastic pressure sensitive adhesive.
5. A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised by depositing the surface protection material as a fusible powder onto the masked bar and subjecting the bar to a temperature both to fuse the powder material into an integral coating and to remove, by melting, the masking material.
6. A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised by masking the surface of the cleaned bar at each of a plurality of moulding positions (21, 21') simultaneously.
7. A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised by moulding onto the bar (20) at each moulding position (26) a thermoplastics component (27) having an upper temperature tolerance less than the temperature to which the bar is subjected prior to the moulding.
8. A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised by moulding onto the bar (20) the non-metallic component (27) with an axial length (X) greater than the unprotected surface at the moulding position (x) such that the end portions of the component are moulded onto the surface 


 protection material (25) at each side of the unprotecte surface (26) .
8. A bar (20) having a surface coating (25) of protectiv material bonded thereto and, at at least one moulding positio (21) along the bar, a non-metallic component (27) moulde integrally onto the bar, characterised in that each sai moulding position comprises an axially extending uncoate portion (26) of the bar and each said component has a centr portion thereof moulded onto the uncoated bar portion.and the end portions thereof moulded onto the coated bar portions eac side of the uncoated moulding position.
