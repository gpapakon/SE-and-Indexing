<ABSTRACT>
An emulsion polymerization process for making a low molecular weight 
alkali-soluble copolymer of a water insoluble monoethylenically unsaturated 

aromatic monomer and methacrylic acid, includes heating an aqueous reaction 
mixture, said reaction mixture having a pH of less than or equal to 4.5 and including 

from 25 to 75 parts by weight of the water insoluble monoethylenically unsaturated 
aromatic monomer; from 25 parts to 75 parts by weight methacrylic acid; a 

polymerization initiator; a reducing agent; a catalyst effective for promoting 
decomposition of the polymerization initiator in the presence of the reducing agent; 

and an amount of a chain transfer agent effective to limit copolymer weight average 
molecular weight to a range of 2,000 to 40,000; to a temperature greater than or 

equal to 75°C; and maintaining the reaction mixture at a temperature greater than or 
equal to 75°C for a period of time effective to allow formation of the copolymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to emulsion copolymers, more particularly 
to low molecular weight alkali-soluble emulsion copolymers, and to methods for 
making such copolymers. Low molecular weight, alkali-soluble copolymers are used in inks, floor 
finishes, paper coatings, paints and adhesives. The copolymers are produced by 
bulk or solution copolymerization of a water insoluble monomer and a water soluble 
monomer. Acrylic acid and methacrylic acid are commonly used to introduce 
solubilizing functionality into such copolymers. Emulsion polymerization offers a particularly desirable process for making 
such polymers because the process is free of residual solvents and the polymer 
produced can be solubilized directly from the emulsion by addition of base. 
However, the emulsion route presents a significant problem with respect to 
maintaining a high polymerization rate when using high levels of chain transfer 
agent to obtain a product having a low molecular weight. US-A-4,628,071 discloses an aqueous emulsion process for preparing a low 
molecular weight alkali-soluble resin from a water insoluble vinylic monomer and 
acrylic acid. However, substitution of methacrylic acid for acrylic acid in the method 
disclosed in the '071 patent is said to produce an unsatisfactory product. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an emulsion 
polymerization process for making a low molecular weight alkali-soluble copolymer 
of a water insoluble mono-ethylenically unsaturated aromatic monomer and 
methacrylic acid, comprising: 
heating an aqueous reaction mixture having a pH of less than or equal to 4.5, 
preferably from 1.5 to 3, and even more preferably from 1.7 to 2.3, and comprising: 
from 25 to 75, preferably from 40 to 60, parts by weight of the water 
insoluble mono-ethylenically unsaturated aromatic monomer; from 25 to 75, preferably from 40 to 60, parts by weight of methacrylic 
acid; a polymerization initiator, preferably in an amount of from 0.4 to 2.0 
parts by weight of the water insoluble ethylenically unsaturated monomer and 
methacrylic acid combined; a reducing agent, preferably in an amount of from 10 to 100 parts by 
weight reducing agent per 100 parts by weight polymerization initiator;  
 a catalyst effective for promoting decomposition of the polymerization 
initiator in the presence of the reducing agent, the catalyst preferably being present 
in an amount of from 0.06 to 0.25 parts by weight catalyst per 100 parts by weight 
polymerization initiator; and an amount
