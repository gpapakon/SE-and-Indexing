<ABSTRACT>
1. The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for the digital sampling rate conversion of a digital input signal of a first sampling rate to a digital output signal of a second sampling rate. 2.1. The invention is based on the object of providing both for the use of a low intermediate conversion frequency and the conversion of different sampling rate ratios for universal applications with little expenditure. 2.2. According to the invention, the digital output signal of the second sampling rate is formed with first intermediate values (X) of the first sampling rate and second intermediate values, forming the digital output signal, between two first intermediate values (X), a control signal, which is both used for generating a clock of the second sampling frequency (Fs2) and for controlling a linear interpolator (LIP), being formed from a ratio between a second sampling frequency (Fs2) of the second sampling rate and a first sampling frequency (Fsa) of the first sampling rate. To implement the linear interpolator (LIP), a serial multiplier can thus be advantageously used by combining the last stage of the digital interpolation filter (DIF) with the linear interpolator (LIP). It is possible to select any ratios between output and input clock and, respectively, output sampling rate and input sampling rate. 2.3. The digital sampling rate converter can be advantageously used as connecting element in digital audio interfaces with different sampling frequency.

Method for the digital conversion of the sampling
rate of a digital input signal having a first sampling rate

(Fsa) into a digital output signal having a second sampling
rate (Fs2), wherein the following steps are executed:


first of all first intermediate values (X) are
generated for the sampling values of the input signal by

means of a digital interpolation filter (DIF), said
intermediate values (X) appearing with a rate being by an

Nth-multiple higher than said first sampling rate (Fsa),
wherein N is a natural number higher than 1, and then a

sampling value for the second scanning raster is determined
from two adjacent intermediate values by means of a linear

interpolator (LIP) by using a spacing factor (?) indicating
the spacing of the sampling value within the second raster

with respect to one of the adjacent intermediate values,
wherein the calculated sampling value is provided in correct

time at the output by means of a clock generator (CG) for a
selected output clock and a selected target frequency,

respectively,

   
characterized in that
,

   the spacing factor (?) is calculated within an
interpolator control (IPC) from the ratio between the second

sampling rate (Fs2) and the Nth-multiple of the first
sampling rate (Fsa) as input value by means of an accumulator

(A10, R11) and a downstream connected multiplier stage (M10).
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

a control signal (P) is formed from the ratio between a
second sampling frequency (Fs2) having the second sampling

rate and a first sampling frequency (Fsa) having the first
sampling rate, said control signal being used both for

generating a clock having the second sampling rate (Fs2) and
for controlling the linear interpolator (LIP). 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 within the multiplier stage (M10) the value within the
accumulator (A10, R11) is linked with a value corresponding

to the ratio of the Nth-multiple of the first sampling rate
(Fsa) with respect to the second sampling rate (Fs2).
Method according to anyone of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 an integer multiple of 128 is used as
integer predetermined number (N) of first intermediate values

(X).
Arrangement for the digital conversion of the
sampling rate of a digital input signal having a first

sampling rate (Fsa) into a digital output signal having a
second sampling rate (Fs2), wherein a first digital

interpolation filter (DIF) is provided generating first
intermediate values (X) for the sampling values of the input

signal appearing at an Nth-multiple higher rate than the
first sampling rate (Fsa), N being a natural number higher

than 1, wherein furthermore an interpolator control (IPC) is
provided, wherein a spacing factor (?) is determined for the

position of a sampling value within the second sampling
raster indicating the spacing of the sampling value within

the second raster with respect to one of the adjacent
intermediate values, that a linear interpolator (LIP) is

provided which is fed by the calculated intermediate values
(X) and which interpolates from two adjacent intermediate

values a sampling value within the second raster by means of
the spacing factor (?) supplied by the interpolator control

(IPC), wherein a clock generator (CG) is provided for
providing the output clock for the second sampling rate in

order to output the interpolated sampling values within the
second sampling raster in correct time, 
characterized in that

an accumulator (A10, R11) is provided within the interpolator
control (IPC) for calculating the spacing factor (?) with is

fed by the ratio between the second sampling rate (Fs2) and 
the Nth-multiple of the first sampling rate (Fsa) as input

value, and that a multiplier stage (M10) is provided
downstream to the accumulator (A10, R11), wherein the value

of the accumulator is multiplied by the inversed ratio
between the second sampling rate (Fs2) and the Nth-multiple

of the first sampling rate (Fsa).
