<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the following pending
and commonly owned European Patent Applications: 93309242.1
and 92107065.2.This invention relates generally to the field of thermal
inkjet printers and more particularly to controlling the ejected
ink drop volume of thermal inkjet printheads by controlling the
temperature of the printhead substrate.Thermal inkjet printers have gained wide acceptance. These
printers are described by W.J. Lloyd and H.T. Taub in "Ink Jet
Devices," Chapter 13 of Output Hardcopy Devices (Ed. R.C. Durbeck
and S. Sherr, San Diego: Academic Press, 1988) and U.S. Patents
4,490,728 and 4,313,684. Thermal inkjet printers produce high
quality print, are compact and portable, and print quickly and
quietly because only ink strikes the paper. An inkjet printer forms a printed image by printing a
pattern of individual dots at particular locations of an array
defined for the printing medium. The locations are conveniently
visualized as being small dots in a rectilinear array. The
locations are sometimes "dot locations", "dot positions", or
pixels". Thus, the printing operation can be viewed as the
filling of a pattern of dot locations with dots of ink.Inkjet printers print dots by ejecting very small drops of
ink onto the print medium, and typically include a movable
carriage that supports one or more printheads each having ink
ejecting nozzles. The carriage traverses over the surface of the
print medium, and the nozzles are controlled to eject drops of
ink at appropriate times pursuant to command of a microcomputer
or other controller, wherein the timing of the application of the
ink drops is intended to correspond to the pattern of pixels of
the image being printed.Color thermal inkjet printers commonly employ a plurality
of printheads, for example four, mounted in the print carriage
to produce different colors. Each printhead contains ink of a
different color, with the commonly used colors being cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black. These base colors are produced by
depositing a drop of the required color onto a dot location,
while secondary or shaded colors are formed by depositing
multiple drops of different base color inks onto the same dot
location, with the overprinting of two or more base colors
producing secondary colors according to well established optical
principles.The typical thermal inkjet printhead (i.e., the silicon
substrate, structures built on the substrate, and connections to
the substrate) uses liquid ink (i.e., colorants dissolved or
dispersed in a solvent).

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling print quality in an ink printer that
includes a printhead having a printhead substrate (40) and ink firing

resistors (38) disposed on the printhead substrate, comprising the steps
of:


selecting a reference temperature;
measuring a temperature of the printhead substrate;
comparing the printhead substrate temperature with the reference
temperature to determine if the substrate temperature is below the

reference temperature; and if so, then
heating the printhead substrate to the reference temperature
periodically during print firing operations by delivering synchronized

heating pulses or printing pulses to the ink firing resistors during
selected print firing periods wherein either said heating pulses or said

printing pulses, but not both, occur during such a selected print firing
period,wherein the step of heating includes the steps of:
generating a heating signal that includes non-firing heating pulses;
generating a print signal that contains printing pulses; and
logically OR-ing the heating signal and the print signal to produce
the synchronizing heating pulses and printing pulses.
An inkjet printer comprising:

an inkjet printhead including a substrate (40) and ink firing
resistors (38) formed in an array of firing chambers on said substrate;
a printhead substrate temperature sensor (22) to monitor an
operating temperature of ink in said firing chambers of said firing

resistors in order to determine an operating temperature output;
means (26) for generating a reference temperature which
constitutes a preferred predetermined minimum value for said operating

temperature; and
pulse generating means (28, 30, 32,34) responsive to said output
of said printhead temperature sensor and to said reference temperature

for driving each of said ink firing resistors with a print signal during a
plurality of print periods, said print signal containing during each of

selected print periods when said operating temperature output is below 
said reference temperature a single pulse that is either an ink firing

print pulse or a non-firing heating pulse, wherein said pulse generating
means comprises:
means (32) for generating a heating signal that includes non-firing
heating pulses;
means (34) for generating a print signal that includes print pulses;
and
means (30,32) for logically OR-ing said heating signal and said
print signal to produce said single pulse.

means includes a controller for synchronizing said non-firing heating

pulses and said print pulses.

heating pulses have a first predetermined pulse width; and which printer

a processing device (28) to change said first predetermined pulse
width of said non-firing heating pulses.
The inkjet printer of Claim 4 wherein said print pulses have
a second predetermined pulse width which is greater than said first

predetermined pulse width.
The inkjet printer of Claim 5 wherein said print pulses have
a second predetermined pulse width which is more than two times

greater than said first predetermined pulse width.

control (25) coupled to said reference temperature generator

to change the reference temperature.

The method of Claim 12 which further includes providing a
variable predetermined pulse width for said heating pulses.
The method of Claim 13 wherein said variable
