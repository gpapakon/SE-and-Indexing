<ABSTRACT>
A cardioplegia system for delivering cardioplegic 
solution to the heart during open heart surgery in 

cooperation with an extracorporeal blood circuit 

employing a heart/lung machine, includes a conduit (12) 
diverting a portion of the blood flow from the heart/lung 

machine to a cardioplegia delivery line (28). A heat 
exchanger (31) for controlling fluid temperature is provided 

in the cardioplegia delivery line. A first pump (30,26) combines 
the blood from the conduit with a second fluid (32) and 

delivers the combined flow into the delivery line (28) leading 
to the heat exchanger (31). A control panel (52) is operatively 

connected for adjusting the ratio of blood (14) and second 
fluid (32) delivered by the first pump (30,26) and for adjusting the 

total volumetric rate of flow from the first pump (30,26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluid delivery systems,
and more particularly to systems for the delivery of
multiple fluids in a cardioplegia circuit to support a
patient's heart during open heart surgery. In the performance of open heart surgery, the
patient is supported by an extracorporeal blood circuit
employing a heart/lung machine. The heart is isolated
from the vascular system, and venous blood is diverted
into the extracorporeal blood circuit where it is
oxygenated, temperature-controlled and returned to the
patient's arterial side. A separate circuit is
established for supplying a cardioplegic solution to the
heart as the surgery proceeds.The cardioplegia circuit functions to still the
heart, lower the metabolic requirements of the heart,
protect the heart during periods of ischemia, and,
finally, prepare the heart for reperfusion at the end of
the procedure. Operation of the extracorporeal blood
circuit as well as the cardioplegia delivery is performed
by a trained perfusionist under the direction of the
surgeon. The principal elements of cardioplegia solution
are blood, representing a small fraction diverted from
the output of the heart/lung machine, combined with a
crystalloid solution. In addition, a minor but critical
amount of potassium solution is added to the cardioplegic
flow to still the heart.Depending upon the requirements of the particular
surgery, the cardioplegia solution may be cooled or
warmed, and may be delivered in antegrade fashion to the
aortic root or coronary ostia, or in a retrograde mode to
the coronary sinus. The requirements placed upon the
cardioplegic solution vary as the surgery proceeds, and
are subject to the clinical judgment of individual
surgeons.A typical cardioplegia delivery system employs two
tubes routed through a single rotary peristaltic pump to 
forward both the separate blood and crystalloid solutions
to a Y combining the two into a single flow. The ratio
between the blood and crystalloid solution is determined
simply by the relative diameters of the tubing carrying
the two solutions, since each is mounted on the same
rotary peristaltic mechanism and thus is forwarded by the
same action. The tubing is usually provided in a 4:1
ratio of blood to crystalloid cross-sectional flow area,
so that the rotary peristaltic pump is delivering blood
and crystalloid to the delivery line in a ratio of
approximately 4:1. Potassium is typically provided to
the delivery line upstream of the pump from two alternate
crystalloid solutions containing potassium, one having a
