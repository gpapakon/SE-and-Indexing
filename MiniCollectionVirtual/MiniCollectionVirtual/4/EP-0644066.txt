<ABSTRACT>
A back for binding a file is described, formed by a C shaped body 
comprising a central zone (5) and two lateral zones (or wings) 

(1,4): one of the wings (1), both of which are movable with respect 
to the central zone, has first connecting means (2), which are 

protruding and can be inserted in corresponding holes in the 
documents constituting the file before being reversibly locked by 

second connecting means (3), of a complementary shape, in the other 
wing (4). 
Preferably, the back binding has also a pair of suspending arms 
(pivotably mounted on said connection means) protruding from the 

extremities of the C shaped body, to be hooked to the sides 
of a file cabinet structure, consenting to file the file without 

needing suspended folders or the like .

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention consists in a back for binding a file, formed by a C 
shaped body whose lateral sides (hereinafter: wings), both movable 
with respect to a central zone, have connecting means which can be 
inserted in holes in the documents constituting the file, and 
thereafter locked to one another; the back binding has also a pair 
of suspending arms which, when protruding from the extremities of 
the C shaped body, can be hooked to the sides of the file cabinet 
structure, consenting to file the file without needing suspended 
folders or the like. Sorting and preserving (hereinafter: binding) paper documents 
constituting a single file and filing the bound files, represented 
and still represent an important economic and organizational problem 
for any institution, even if small. With the exception of microfilm systems and the filing methods 
using fileholders, envelops and the like in which the documents are 
inserted without being in some way bound, the presently known and 
used filing methods are: 
binding the documents usually bearing two holes in folders, 
provided with a foldable blade (usually metallic and preferably 
plastified), in which the same documents are held by means of said 
holes: the file can be easily updated, but its inspection is not 
always easy and in the long term there is the risk to tear the  
 
documents at the holes; binding the documents bearing two or more holes in binders, having 
opening metal rings, to which the documents are bound by means of 
said holes: the file can be easily updated and generally easily 
inspected, but in the long term there is the risk to tear the 
documents at the holes; binding the documents, holed in a plurality of points by suitable 
devices, using a metallic spiral (preferably plastified) or a 
plastic back which binds the documents by inserting itself in said 
holes: the file can be updated and filed with great difficulty; binding the documents by back glueing by means of specific 
binding machines: the file cannot be updated. One of the most used methods for filing a file requires inserting 
each file in a suspended folder (or equivalent means), hanging on 
supports placed under the shelves of racks and/or cabinets or on the 
edges of a drawer: such filing method consents to easily find a 
file, but it is costly, in that it requires to frequently buy new 
suspended folders to receive new documents and/or to replace the 
folders torn or anyway damaged by consulting the files. The back according to present invention refers to a simple and

<CLAIMS>
Back to bind a file, characterized by the fact of being formed by 
a body in plastic material comprising a central zone (5) and two 

lateral zones (or wings) (1, 4) foldable with respect to said 
central zone (5) to obtain a C shaped body, one of said wings (1) 

bearing first connecting means (2) which can be inserted in holes 
punched in the documents forming said file, and to be coupled to a 

corresponding second connecting means (3) born by the other of said 
wings (4). 
Back for binding according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
further comprises a pair of suspending arms (10), protruding from 

the sides of said C shaped body, to suspend said back to means for 
filing said file. 
Back according to claim 2, characterized in that said sus-pending 
arms (10) rotate around said connecting means (2, 3) placed at the 

extremities of said C shaped body, said connecting means (2, 3) 
being inserted in a hole (11) punched at one of the extremities of 

said suspending arms (10), in that when at working position said 
arms (10) protrude from the sides of said C shaped body while, when 

at rest position, the same are folded within said C shaped body, 
from which only partially protrude at the extremity bearing said 

hole (11), and in that said extremity of said suspending arms (10), 
protruding from said C shaped body, has a groove (13) allowing an 

easy rotation of said suspending arms (10) from said rest position 
to said working position. 
Back according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that said first 

 
and second connection means (2, 3) are reversibly coupled to one 

another. 
Back according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that on the 
internal surface of at least one of said wings (1, 4) reference 

marks (8) are engraved to permit the use of punchers having fewer 
punches than said connecting means (2, 3). 
Back according to claims 1 or 2, for binding, at choice, 
documents having two different normalized formats, characterized in 

that on the internal surface of at least one of said wings (1, 4) 
there is at least one further reference mark (9) defining the 

portion of said back to be detached to bind said documents 
presenting said lesser format.
