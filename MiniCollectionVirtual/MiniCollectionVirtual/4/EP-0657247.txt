<ABSTRACT>
The end face of an optical fiber assembly consisting of an 
optical fiber s and a ferrule f is polished to form a conical 

surface with oblique faces Fp1 and Fp2 such that, central axis 
Ap of said conical surface makes an inclination of 8° with 

respect to the optical axis L of said optical fiber s, top Ft 
of said conical surface coincides with the optical axis L of 

said optical fiber s, and has a taper angle of 2°. 
Thereafter, said optical fiber assembly is further polished to 

form an oblique convex spherical surface at the end face such 
that, central axis of said oblique convex spherical surface 

makes an inclination of 8° with respect to the optical axis L 
of said optical fiber s. Due to this, insertion loss and light 

reflected back to the source is stabilized and minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to a method for manufacturing
optical fiber assembly with polished end face, an end face
polishing apparatus
for improving the
connection characteristics of optical fibers in assemblies of
the sort used in analog image communications like CATV (CAble
TeleVision), very high speed communications and optical
amplifiers, or optical fiber assemblies having isolator
functions.The prior art for connecting two optical fibers with a small 
connection loss and little light reflected back to the source
has been proposed in U.S.P. 5245684 and Laid-open Japanese
Patent Application Nos. 87111/1986 and 121805/1989. The
objective is achieved by polishing the ferrule tips of both the
fibers to an oblique convex spherical surface and connecting
said fibers by bringing these oblique convex spherical surfaces
in contact with each other.For example, referring to FIG. 16, to connect the optical
fibers s and s', the end faces of the ferrules f and f' of
these optical fibers are polished to form oblique spherical
surfaces q and q' in such a way that, the line joining the
centers of curvature C and C' of the said oblique spherical
surfaces q and q' makes an angle of 8° with respect to the
optical axes L and L' of said optical fibers.The foregoing method improves the coincidence of the optical
axes of the fibers s and s' and enables light reflected back to
the source to be minimized.In conventional optical connector end-face polishing methods,
the convex spherical surface q is formed according to the
procedure mentioned below.In the beginning, as shown in FIG. 17(a), the optical fiber s
and the ferrule f with a conically tapered tip Ft are bonded by
reinforced adhesive.Next, as shown in FIG. 17(b), the ferrule f is rotated around 
a vertical axis of rotation after inclining it by an angle of
8° on a polishing disc (not shown in the figure), thereby
forming an oblique horizontal surface F at the tip of the
ferrule f. Because the ferrule f has a conically tapered tip,
the center Ft of the oblique horizontal surface F is offset
from the point P where the optical axis of the optical fiber s
intersects with the surface F.Hereafter, as shown in FIG. 17(c), the ferrule f in its
inclined position is rotated around a vertical axis of rotation
on a polishing disc with an elastic abrasive disc mounted (not
shown in the figure) on it, thereby forming a oblique convex
spherical surface q at the tip of it.In the aforementioned conventional method for polishing the
end face of the optical connector, the center qt of
