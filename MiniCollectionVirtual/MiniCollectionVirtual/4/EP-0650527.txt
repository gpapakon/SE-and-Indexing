<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to valuable and useful developments
in diagnostics of and vaccines against Borrelia
burgdorferi based upon new findings about new classes of
Borrelia burgdorferi (from now on B. burgdorferi) and
especially about DNA and peptide sequences from the B.
burgdorferi strains ACA1 and Ip90 (the same as Iper90) and
their relationship to B. burgdorferi strain B31, including
special sequences from the three different strains of B.
burgdorferi useful as primers in the PCR-DNA detection of
B. burgdorferi in specimens from animals, including humans,
a diagnostic kit for diagnosing Lyme disease in animals,
including humans, DNA sequences from B. burgdorferi strains
ACA1 and Ip90 encoding polypeptides related to the outer
membrane protein OspA and OspB, a polypeptide encoded from
ACA1 and Ip90, epitopes from OspA and OspB, and a vaccine
against Lyme disease comprising one or more epitopes from
OspA and OspB.Lyme disease is a zoonosis caused by the tick-borne spirochaete
B. burgdorferi. When a susceptible host is bitten by
an ixodid tick, B. burgdorferi organisms enter the skin. In
humans the initial skin manifestation is termed erythema
chronicum migrans (ECM) whereas a long-standing infection
of the skin produces acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans.
The Borrelia organisms also enter the circulatory system of
the host and are distributed to various organs, including
the brain and joints. A secondary spread of the pathogens
produces a variety of clinical syndromes, including lymphocytic
meningoradiculitis, myocarditis and chronic arthritis.
In many patients the infection of some tissues,
particularly the brain and joints, persists for years and
can be severely disabling. These forms of chronic Lyme
disease are a consequence of the host's inability to rid 
itself of the infectious agent and perhaps the development
of an autoimmune reaction.Diagnosis of Lyme disease has chiefly been based on clinical
evidence. The best marker during the primary stage of
infection has conventionally been the presence of erythema
chronicum migrans (ECM) but these skin lesions may not
always develop or they may manifest atypically. Moreover,
Lyme disease can be confused with other illnesses characterized
by neurologic or arthritic manifestations. When
clinical histories are incomplete, serologic testing with
determination of antibody titers is the best conventionally
laboratory method of diagnosis. Indirect fluorescent antibody
(IFC) staining tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISA) are used to

<CLAIMS>
A method for detecting the presence of a 
B. burgdorferi
 organism in animals, including
humans, the method comprising subjecting a specimen from the animal, such as a body

fluid, such as blood, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid or urine, or
a tissue biopsy, to PCR-DNA analysis which


A) comprises using a nucleotide primer sequence which comprises at least 11
nucleotides, the primer sequence being identical to a part of a sequence of OspA

and OspB DNA from one of the B. burgdorferi strains B31, lp90 and ACA1, which
part of the sequence is different from any part of the sequence of the two other

species, the difference being such that the sequence will not anneal to DNA from
the two other species, and, upon completion of the PCR DNA-analysis, identifying

the detected 
B. burgdorferi
 organism as belonging to one of the classes I, II and III
of 
B. burgdorferi
, of which classes B31, Ip90 and ACA1 are reference strains, or
B) comprises using a combination of at least two nucleotide primer sequences, each of
which comprises at least 11 nucleotides, one sequence being identical to a part of a

sequence from the OspA and OspB DNA from a first 
B. burgdorferi
 strain B31,
another sequence being identical to a part of a sequence from the OspA and OspB

DNA from another 
B. burgdorferi
 strain Ip90, and optionally a third sequence which
is identical to a part of a sequence from the third 
B. burgdorferi
 strain species ACA1
and, upon completion of the PCR DNA-analysis, identifying the detected 
B. burgdorferi

organism as belonging to one of the classes I, II and III of 
B. burgdorferi
 of
which classes strains B31, Ip90 and ACA1 are reference strains, or
C) comprises using a nucleotide primer sequence which comprises at least 11
nucleotides, the primer sequence being identical to a part of a sequence of at least

two of three OspA and OspB DNA sequences derived from 
B. burgdorferi
 strains
B31, lp90 and ACA1, and, upon completion of the PCR DNA-analysis, identifying

the detected 
B. burgdorferi
 organism as belonging to a group consisting of at least
two of the classes I, II and III of 
B. burgdorferi
, of which classes strains B31, Ip90
and ACA1 are reference strains.
A diagnostic PCR kit for detecting the presence of a 
B. burgdorferi
 organism in a
specimen from an animal, including a human, substantially independently of the individual

strain of the 
B. burgdorferi
 potentially being present in the specimen, and for identifying
the detected 
B. burgdorferi
 organism as belonging to one of the classes I, II and III of 
B.
burgdorferi
, of which classes B31, Ip90 and ACA1 are reference strains, the kit comprising
the following primers or primer combinations


A) a nucleotide primer sequence which comprises at least 11 nucleotides, the primer
sequence being identical to a part of a sequence of OspA and OspB DNA from one

of the B. burgdorferi strains B31, Ip90 and ACA1, which part of the sequence is
different from any part of the sequence of the two other species, the difference

being such that the sequence will not anneal to DNA from the two other species, or
B) a combination of at least two nucleotide primer sequences, each of which comprises
at least 11 nucleotides, one sequence being identical to a part of a sequence from

the OspA and OspB DNA from a first 
B. burgdorferi
 strain B31, another sequence
being identical to a part of a sequence from the OspA and OspB DNA from another


B. burgdorferi
 strain Ip90, and optionally a third sequence which is identical to a part
of a sequence from the third 
B. burgdorferi
 strain species ACA1, or
C) a nucleotide primer sequence which comprises at least 11 nucleotides, the primer
sequence being identical to a part of a sequence of at least two of three OspA and

OspB DNA sequences derived from 
B. burgdorferi
 strains B31, Ip90 and ACA1.
A method according to claim 1C) wherein the primer comprises a sequence which is
identical to one of the following sequences (or one of their complementary sequences):


A PCR kit according to claim 2C) wherein the primer comprises a sequence which is
identical to one of the following sequences (or one of their complementary sequences):
