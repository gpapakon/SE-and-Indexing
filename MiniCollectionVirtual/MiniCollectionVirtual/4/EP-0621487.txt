<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high voltage phasing
detector, namely an instrument to determine whether the
voltages on two conductors are in phase.Such instruments are used, for example, to check
phasing across switchgear and bus-bars after maintenance.
Instruments are known which comprise two resistors contained
in insulating rods: one end of each rod has a contact probe,
for contact with the conductors to be tested. The other ends
of the rods are connected together via an insulated conductor
and a detector, either in the form of an analog meter or an
indicator such as a neon or light emitting diode. If the two
conductors which the two probes contact are in phase, then no
current flows and the detector reads zero (if it is an analog
meter), or does not illuminate (if it is a neon or LED).
However, if the two conductors are out of phase, the detector
will give a reading (if it is an analog meter) or it will
illuminate (if it is a neon or LED).FR-A-2,498,333 discloses a detector having two inputs
for connection to respective probes for contacting a pair of
conductors to be tested, a rectifier circuit to which said
inputs are connected, threshold means for providing an output
signal when the output voltage of said rectifier circuit
exceeds a predetermined value, and indicator means responsive
to said output signal.Under new standards to be introduced, a current of only
0.75mA is available when the two conductors under test are out
of phase. This current is sufficient to illuminate neons, but
generally neons give poor illumination and are not particularly
reliable. Light emitting diodes give good illumination, but
require a relatively high current, typically 10mA. Neither
neons nor LED's have a precise switching point. It is possible
to include a battery-driven arrangement in the instrument to
provide a precise switching point, but this has the
disadvantage that the battery must be replaced when discharged
and further a circuit is required to detect when the battery
is discharged.We have now devised a high voltage phasing detector 
which overcomes these difficulties.In accordance with this invention, there is provided a
detector having to inputs for connection to respective probes
for contacting a pair of conductors to be tested, a rectifier
circuit to which said inputs are connected, threshold means for
providing an output signal when the output voltage of said
rectifier circuit exceeds a predetermined value, and indicator
means responsive to said output signal, the detector being
characterised in that a
