<ABSTRACT>
Raw starch which has been treated with an 
emulsifying agent during refining is alkali treated, 

washed to remove flavor, crosslinked, neutralized, 
gelatinized and treated with an emulsifying agent to 

give instant starch useful for instant puddings and 
mixes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processing starch materials
and products and is particularly useful for upgrading the
quality of pregelatinized waxy maize starch for use in
desserts.An alkali treatment, wash, neutralization, and spray
drying of starch using a two fluid nozzle is taught in US-A-4477480.
Two fluid nozzles for cooking starch are taught in
US-A-4280851. EP-A-0011479 relates to a method for preparing
pregelatinized modified starch, the modifier being sodium or
calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate or a combination of a protein
and an emulsifier.The prior art, however, has not discovered how to make
deflavored cereal starch of good viscosity and flavor without
a hydroxypropylation step which produces undesired propylene
chlorohydrin. Crosslinked tapioca starch is presently used
when good, high viscosity, pregelatinized starch is required
for puddings. Hydroxypropylated, deflavored, crosslinked,
pregelatinized dent cornstarch has also been used.The present invention provides a process for preparing
a deflavored, non-hydroxypropylated crosslinked, pre-gelatinized
cereal starch comprising:
a) obtaining raw starch from cereal grain, by means of
a refining process;b) washing the raw starch with water which
contains an emulsifier having an HLB value greater
than 1.0;c) dispersing and agitating the raw cereal starch 
in water to form a homogeneous slurry containing at
least 25% starch; d) adding a base to adjust the slurry pH to at least
11.0; e) washing the starch solids of step (c) with water to
remove flavor while maintaining the starch pH above
11.0 and while maintaining the starch solids
concentration at at least 25% or more; f) crosslinking the deflavored starch using any food-acceptable
procedure; g) neutralizing the starch to a pH of from 5.0 to 9.0,
then gelatinizing and drying the neutralized starch
using a process selected from the group consisting
of spray-drying using a two-fluid nozzle, drum
drying, and cooking in a water-miscible solvent at
high temperature and pressure followed by drying,
with the proviso that the starch is not
hydroxypropylated.We have discovered a process that can be used to upgrade
cereal starches such as waxy maize starch and other
applicable cereal starches, including corn hybrids and corn
genetic varieties, such as amylo maize starch and dull waxy
starch, that need deflavoring so that they may be used in
instant puddings without the need for hydroxypropylation. We
have discovered that for waxy maize starch deflavoring must
be done before crosslinking. We have also discovered
