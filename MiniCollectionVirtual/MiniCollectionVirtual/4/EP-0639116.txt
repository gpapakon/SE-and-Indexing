<ABSTRACT>
A pattern (1) from which cast nodes can be produced, the pattern including a central ring or disc (2) against which one or more stubs (3) abut at selected stations to enable nodes of differing annular geometries and/or stub diameter to be produced from the same pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pattern for casting nodes.Steel node structures are conventionally formed with welded plate
node points typically at the intersection of tubular or box members.
See e.g. the hub employed for interconnecting straight, elongate members disclosed in
US-A-3 461 635. Cast
steel nodes have been developed to improve the performance of such node
points in relation to stress flow and fatigue during use.One object of this invention is to reduce the cost and weight of such
nodes by minimising the size of the node and by making savings in pattern
making costs. Nodes in accordance with the invention are one piece
castings whose stubs are formed onto a central ring or disc.According to the present invention in one aspect, there is provided
a pattern from which a node can be cast as a single integral piece, the
pattern being characterised in that a pattern from which a steel node can be 
cast as a single integral piece, the pattern being characterised in that it
comprises a central ring and a plurality of separate stubs, each stub capable
of being positioned at one of a plurality of stations around a periphery of the
central ring and in abutment therewith to enable a plurality of steel cast
nodes, to be produced from the same pattern, each node having a differing
angular geometry.The axis of the ring is generally, but not always normal to the axes of the
main stubs. The ring is preferably of circular form, other configurations may,
however, be employed. The presence of the ring also allows the adoption
of standardised pattern equipment in which stub pattern pieces may be
positioned at selected stations around the circumference of the central ring
to allow for differences in stub spacings and angles.The weight of nodes in accordance with the invention is also minimised
when compared with more conventional cast or fabricated nodes by
intersecting the stubs onto a disc, preferably of annular construction. The
node stubs may be wholly or partly conical or necked in shape at their point
of connection with the central ring or disc, the whole then making up a
single piece integrated casting. Nodes in accordance with the present
invention differ from those proposed previously in that:-
(a) the stubs connect to a central ring or disc whose axis is usually
normal to the axes of the main stubs.(b) the stubs need only to reduce in diameter for part of their
circumference because they meet at the centre, i.e. the
"pinching in" of the diameter need not be uniform around the
circumference; (c) the

<CLAIMS>
A pattern from which a steel node can be cast as a single integral
piece, the pattern being characterised in that it comprises a central

ring (2) and a plurality of separate stubs (3), each stub capable of being
positioned at one of a plurality of stations around a periphery of the

central ring and in abutment therewith to enable a plurality of steel
cast nodes, to be produced from the same pattern, each node having

a differing angular geometry.
A pattern as claimed in claim 1 wherein the ring is of circular form.
A cast steel node constructed from a pattern as claimed in claim 1 or claim
2 and characterised by a central ring from the circumference of which

extend two or more stubs, the axis of the central ring lying generally
normal to the axis of each stub.
A node as claimed in claim 3 characterised in that the depth of the
central ring is less than the depth of each stub.
