<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is provided for crushing a portion of a corrugated plate in a selected area of the corrugations without blocking the grooves (14, 14'). In accordance with the method teeth are inserted into grooves on opposite sides of the corrugated plate and the corrugation ridges associated with such grooves are, axially adjacent such insertion, crushed to a predetermined thickness (CT). The teeth are then withdrawn, the corrugated plate is indexed a desired number of ridges/grooves and the die members are again engaged with the opposite sides of the plate (10). The apparatus for crushing a plate (10) includes a frame for supporting the plate, a feed apparatus for moving the plate at the desired time in the desired direction, and a forming apparatus for crushing plate ridges in a zone (B') and obstructing, in a transition zone (C) between the crushed ridges and the uncrushed ridges, ridge transverse movement into adjacent grooves.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionMethod and Apparatus For Flattening Portions Of A Corrugated PlateTechnical FieldThis invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for forming a metal plate and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for crushing to a predetermined extent selected ridge portions on a corrugated plate while maintaining the associated grooves in an open configuration in the zone between the crushed and uncrushed ridge portions.Background Art Thin, corrugated metal plate is used in a variety of applications and, depending upon the application, may require a portion of the corrugation ridges to be flattened or crushed. An example of an application where such selective corrugation crushing is useful is heat recovery apparatus such as primary surface recuperators. The corrugation grooves on opposite sides of a metal plate serve to direct the flow of relatively warm and cool fluids with heat being transferred directly through the plate between the fluids. Peripheral portions of several such plates are suitably welded together to prevent the relatively warm and cool fluids from intermixing.Before the plates are assembled, selected portions of the plates' ridges are crushed to provide flattened header sections which will facilitate the manifolding of fluids and render their handling more feasible. These header or manifolds sections at each end of the plate receive or deliver the fluid from or to an appropriate passage of the recuperator assembly. 

 A stacked plate heat exchanger of the type described herein is illustrated in U.S. Patent 3,759,323. In fabricating heat exchangers of that type, difficulties have been encountered in flattening the header sections. Such header sections extend transversely to the corrugation ridges/grooves, and as the ridges in the header sections are flattened, the ridges expand transversely and often completely or at least partially block the transversely adjacent corrugation grooves which act as fluid passageways. Various attempts to mitigate this problem have been attempted but each have, in some respect, been found to be less than totally satisfactory. U.S. Patent 4,434,637 has two, inter- engaging die members of desired axial length to maintain the corrugation grooves in a substantially open configuration while crushing the associated ridges to the desired thickness for an axial length equal to the die's axial length. Subsequently, when the ridge portions which are axially adjacent the previously crushed ridge portions are, in turn, crushed, the crushed thicknesses
