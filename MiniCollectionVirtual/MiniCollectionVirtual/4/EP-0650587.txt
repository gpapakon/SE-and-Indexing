<ABSTRACT>
A process for detecting misfiring in an internal combustion engine in which: uneven running values are detected giving a measure of changes in the crankshaft speed of the engine caused by misfiring; the distance between bands of uneven running values is calculated; a check is made to discover whether the calculated band distance is greater than a preset threshold and, if so, the information is used as an indication that there is misfiring and not irregularities in the crankshaft speed; if there is no significant band distance greater than the threshold and, in addition, irregular running lies below a preset negative threshold, this is used as an indication of the presence of irregularities in the crankshaft speed and misfiring detection is stopped. This process makes it possible to distinguish reliably between major running irregularities caused by misfiring and corresponding values caused by irregularities which may be transmitted to the engine from the drive train.

Method for detecting misfires in an internal 
combustion engine, in which 


lack-of-smoothness values (LU) are recorded, these 
being a measure of changes in the crankshaft speed of the 

engine due to misfires, characterized in that 
the spacing (W) between bands of lack-of-smoothness 
values is calculated and 
a check is performed as to whether the calculated band 
spacing is greater than a specified threshold spacing 

(W_SW), and, if this is the case, this information is 
used as an indication that misfires are present rather 

than disturbances of the crankshaft speed. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the step of calculating the spacing between two 

bands of lack-of-smoothness values has the following 
substeps: 


a positive lack-of-smoothness threshold value (SW_P) is 
specified; 
the lowest lack-of-smoothness value that appears to be 
reliable above this threshold value is determined; 
the highest lack-of-smoothness value that appears 
reliable below this threshold value is determined, and 
the difference between the two values determined is 
formed and used as a measure of the band spacing around 

the positive lack-of-smoothness threshold value. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the calculated band spacing is compared with a 

threshold spacing (W_SW_P) and, if the band spacing is 
smaller than the threshold spacing, the procedure  

 
continues as follows: 


the lack-of-smoothness threshold value zero (SW_0) is 
specified; 
the lowest positive lack-of-smoothness value that 
appears reliable is determined; 
the highest negative lack-of-smoothness value that 
appears reliable is determined; 
the difference between the two values determined is 
formed and used as a measure for the band spacing around 

the lack-of-smoothness threshold value zero, and 
this calculated band spacing is compared with a threshold 
spacing (W_SW_O). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that if no band spacing larger than the 

threshold spacing assigned to it is detected, the procedure 
continues as follows: 


a negative lack-of-smoothness threshold value (SW_N) is 
specified; 
an investigation is performed as to whether a lack-of-smoothness 
value that appears reliable is below this 

threshold value and 
if this condition is met, this information is used as 
an indication that there is a disturbance of the crankshaft 

speed due to drive-line oscillations, and misfire 
detection is interrupted. 
Apparatus for suppressing interference in the 
detection of misfires in an internal combustion engine 

(14) with 

a device (11) for calculating lack-of-smoothness 
values, which are a measure of changes in the crankshaft 

speed of the engine due to misfires; characterized by: 
a device (15) which calculates the spacing between 
bands of lack-of-smoothness values; 
a memory (17) which specifies a lack-of-smoothness 
threshold value (SW_P or SW_O), a threshold spacing 

(W_SW_P or W_SW_0) and a negative lack-of-smoothness 
threshold value (SW_N), these values generally being 

dependant on the instantaneous engine operating state, 
and  

 
a comparison device (16) which compares the calculated 
band spacing with the specified threshold spacing and, in 

the case of a significant band spacing, emits an indication 
that misfires are present, while, otherwise, given 

simultaneous undershooting of the negative lack-of-smoothness 
threshold value by the lack-of-smoothness 

values, it diagnoses a disturbance of the crankshaft 
speed and interrupts misfire detection.
