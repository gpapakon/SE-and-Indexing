<ABSTRACT>
The system and process involves a multimedia display system 
for displaying a file such as a defect file with defect 

data and also the graphic data which shows an electronic 
picture of the defect on a computer monitor. The system 

simplifies the updating of a menu, defect description 
files, and photos by means of a seamless interface between 

a host computer and the personal computers used as 
terminals by the users. A host based system provides 

defect descriptions and data distribution together with the 
capability of viewing high resolution photos on a personal 

computer via a seamless interface between it and the host 
which provides access through use of the personal computer 

to the defect description file on the host and to the photo 
reference on the host.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data processing networks and more 
particularly to multimedia display of graphic and text 
information in a data processing system. Multimedia as employed herein refers to the use of 
different forms of communication (media) within a computer 
setting: including text, and images (photographs) as well 
as video, audio, etc. There has been an ongoing problem of describing 
semiconductor and substrate component defects using 
electronic media. Written descriptions are not adequate to 
describe the immense variety of visually identifiable 
defects. Terminals connected to a host computer are 
typically capable of displaying only line drawings, which 
are insufficient to describe the defects in such components 
accurately. What is needed is the capability of rapidly viewing a 
detailed, clear, high resolution picture of the defect that 
is being described verbally. Current solutions to this problem require special 
stand-alone equipment to view the photos, with nothing that 
combines a host based computer system of written 
descriptions of defects with photos that are viewable on 
off-the-shelf personal computers. "Providing the Ability for PS/2 Users to View Photo Images 
Through the Intersite Line Comparison System", IBM 
Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 34, No. 6, p. 140 (Nov. 
1991) describes a photo imaging system for use in 
connection with the above ILC system where each photo is 
treated separately, and which can be viewed independently.  An object of this invention is to simplify the process of 
updating the menu, the defect description files, and the 
photos by means of a seamless interface between the host 
and the personal computer. In accordance with this 
invention a host based system provides defect descriptions 
and data distribution together with the capability of 
viewing high resolution photos on a personal computer via a 
seamless interface between it and the host which provides 
access through use of the personal computer to the defect 
description file on the host and to the photo reference on 
the host. As employed herein the term "host" may refer to a server or 
mainframe CPU. As employed herein, the term "seamless" refers to a 
sequence of steps as follows: 
1. the user loads an image into a directory on the PC hard 
drive 2. On the host the user consults the defect definition 
file while editing, 3. The user moves the cursor to photo name and hits a 
function key F2. As a result without issuing any 
upload commands or any data base transaction commands,

<CLAIMS>
A host based, multimedia, distributed processor data 
processing system including 


a) a host, 
b) defect description means for providing defect 
descriptions files on said host, 
c) means for providing high resolution photographs on said 
host, 
d) means for viewing said high resolution photographs on a 
workstation computer, 
 
   means for providing data distribution together with the 

capability via a seamless interface between said 
workstation and said host which provides access through use 

of said workstation computer to said defect description 
file on the host and to the photo reference on the host. 
A host based, multimedia, distributed processor data 
processing system including 


a) a host and a data processing work station storing an 
image file therein, said host storing a plurality of 

defect description files, 
b) input means at said intelligent terminal whereby a user 
enters the identification of an image file anywhere in 

a said defect description file. 
c) function selection means at said work station for 
reception of user entry of a function selection to said 

system, 
d) means for uploading said image file to said host. 
A system in accordance with claim 1 or 2 including a 
network of data processing devices linked to said host, 

and wherein operation of said function selection means 
to upload said image file to said host distributes said 

image file to the network. 
A system in accordance with any of the preceding claims 
wherein deletion of the photo from said host and said 

network is accomplished by operation of another 
function selection means. 
A system in accordance with any of the preceding claims 
wherein said host comprises a distributed network of 

host computers.
