<ABSTRACT>
The present invention envisions a headlamp calibration 
assembly (42) for use with an adjustable headlamp assembly 

(22). The headlamp assembly (22) includes a housing (30), a 
moveable headlamp component (32), such as a reflector, 

adjustably retained in the housing (30) and horizontal and 
vertical aiming devices (36,34). The housing (30) has a 

viewing port (46) formed therethrough for viewing inside of 
the housing (30) for observing the movable component. The 

calibration assembly (42) includes an adjustably mounted 
lens (44) positioned over the viewing port (46), horizontal 

position indicia (62) on the reflector (32) positioned for 
viewing through the lens (44) and viewing port (46) 

including a zero adjustment indicator (80) represented by a 
selected one of the horizontal position indicia (62), and 

sight means (66) on the lens (44) in the form of indicia or 
the like for sighting and alignment with the horizontal 

position indicia (62) to attain zero adjustment. The 
sighting device (66) on the lens (44) includes two pairs of 

spaced apart parallel lines (68) on either side of the lens 
(44) to minimize parallax when viewing the horizontal 

position indicia (62). Additionally, a magnifying prism 
(64) may be formed in the lens (44) so that smaller indicia 

may be used to thereby increase the precision of the 
horizontal adjustment. The horizontal position indicia (62) 

may be positionable on or proximate to a vertical position 
indicating device (50) such as a spirit level (54). The 

vertical position indicating device (50) may be positioned 
for viewing through the lens (44) and viewing port (46).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to calibration means for
use with an adjustable headlamp which is capable of
indicating a desired predetermined setting as well as
variations from said predetermined setting. The calibration
means retain the indication of the settings so that when the
headlamp becomes misaligned, the headlamp can be readjusted
to the desired predetermined setting.Headlamp assemblies for vehicles, and more
particularly, automobiles, have been studied, engineered,
and designed to be less expensive and more aerodynamically
efficient. In terms of aerodynamic efficiency, since a
headlamp is positioned at the front of a vehicle wind drag
on the vehicle can be affected by the shape of the headlamp.
As such, headlamps have been aerodynamically designed to
reduce the wind drag on the vehicle. Aerodynamic headlamp
designs have resulted in sealed headlamp assemblies whereby
each headlamp assembly includes a housing which is a sealed
unit containing an adjustable reflector and an illuminating
device or bulb mounted to the reflector.Another design change that has been evolving in the
automotive industry is the reduction of the overall vehicle
size and the more efficient utilization of the space within 
the vehicle. Space within the engine compartment of the
vehicle is utilized under close scrutiny in order to
maximize the efficient use of the limited amount of space.The sealed housing headlamp assemblies extend into the
engine compartment. As previously mentioned, the reflector
is adjustably retained within the housing of the headlamp
assembly. Devices have been developed which are mounted to
and extend through the housing and cooperate with the
reflector to remotely adjust the horizontal and vertical
orientation of the reflector. In this regard, each headlamp
assembly typically uses a vertical and horizontal adjusting
mechanism to adjust the reflector.Several U.S. patents are listed below to provide
examples of sealed housing headlamp assemblies including
vertical and horizontal adjustment devices.
U.S. Patent No. 5,067,052, 11/19/91 to Suzuki et al.; U.S. Patent No. 5,077,642, 12/31/91 to Lisak;U.S. Patent No. 5,121,303, 6/9/92 to Shirai et al.;U.S. Patent No. 5,140,503, 8/18/92 to Lisak.The disclosures of the above patents are incorporated
herein by reference and teach devices which include a single
pivot point attached between the reflector and the housing.
The pivot point provides a fixed reference from which the
vertical and horizontal aiming adjustments are made. When a
