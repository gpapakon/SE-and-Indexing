<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vortex pneumatic classifier to be 
used for the object of classifying granular or powdered raw material, 
such as cement, calcium carbonate, ceramics, etc. A conventional vortex pneumatic classifier disperses with air 
flow particulate raw material, for example, granular or powdered 
material such as limestone dust, classifies the said granular or 
powdered material into coarse powder and fine powder employing the 
balance between centrifugal force and drag force, and at the same time, 
discharges the said fine powder to the exterior of the machine, which 
then becomes product. (See Japanese Patent Publication No. 57-24189.) As is generally known, in the event that the theoretical 
classifying particle diameter Dp(th) [m] is where the particle Reynolds 
number 
Rep = Dp(th) Vrρf/µ<2  
, it can be obtained by the general 
formula described below.

Dp(th) = (1/Vt) √18µ(D/2)Vr/ρp


 
   In this general formula, Vt indicates the peripheral speed 
(m/s) of the tip of the vortex flow adjusting vanes, µ indicates the 
viscosity coefficient of the air (Pa·s), D indicates the rotor  
 
diameter (m), Vr indicates the speed of the inwardly flowing air (m/s) 
at the tip of the vortex flow adjusting vanes, and ρp indicates the 
density of the air. However, upon comparison of the theoretical classifying 
particle diameter Dp(th) obtained from the said general formula and the 
classifying particle diameter obtained from actual classifying Dp(obs), 
it has been found that the following relationship exists between 
the two, and these two do not necessarily agree.

Dp(obs) ≧ Dp(th) 


 
That is to say, the smaller that the target classifying particle 
diameter becomes, the larger the classifying particle diameter actually 
obtained Dp(obs) becomes as compared to the theoretical classifying 
particle diameter Dp(th). This inventor has found the following to be true, upon studying 
the cause of the said relationship between the particule diameter Dp(th) 
and the particule diameter Dp(obs). As shown in Fig. 6, the tangential direction flow speed 
distribution of the flow within the vortex-type pneumatic classifier 
which is provided with guide vanes A8 and vortex flow adjusting vanes 
(rotor blades) A6 which are opposed across the classifying chamber A7 
is described as W in Fig. 6. The classifying particle diameter Dp is 
determined by the balance between; centrifugal forces FCA and FCB which 
are dependent on tangential direction flow speeds VtA and VtB, 
and drag forces FdA and FdB which are
