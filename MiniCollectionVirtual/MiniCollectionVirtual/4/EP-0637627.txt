<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to detergent formulations which contain     (a) 3 to 70 % by weight of surfactants,   (b) 1 to 60 % by weight of copolymers of at least three monomers,   (c) 0 to 60 % by weight of detergent alkalis,   (d) 0 to 70 % by weight of fillers and   (e) difference from 100 % by weight other functional auxiliaries.   The formulations according to the invention are distinguished by biodegradability and result in distinctly less sewage sludge compared with conventional formulations.

<CLAIMS>
Detergent formulations which are free of zeolites
and crystalline layer silicates and include


a) from 3 to 70 wt.-% of surfactants,
b) from 1 to 60 wt.-% of readily biodegradable copolymers
which have a degradation level of â‰¥60% as

determined according to the modified OECD Sturm
test and are obtained from


A. monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids
and/or salts thereof,
B. monoethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic
acids and/or salts thereof,
C. monounsaturated monomers, and
D. from 0 to 15 wt.-% of other monomers capable of
undergoing free-radical copolymerization

by free-radical polymerization in an aqueous medium,
and have one or more hydroxyl groups on the

C-C polymer carbon chain as a result of subsequent
hydrolysis or saponification of the monomer units

C., and
c) from 0 to 60 wt.-% of washing alkalis, with the exception
of 5 wt.-% sodium metasilicate,
d) from 0 to 70 wt.-% of fillers, and
e) other functional auxiliary agents to make
100 wt.-%.
The detergent formulations according to claim
1, characterized in that the components a) are included

with 5 to 40 wt.-%.
The detergent formulations according to claim
1, characterized in that the components a) are included

with 7 to 25 wt.-%. 
The detergent formulations according to claim
1, characterized in that the components b) are included

with 5 to 40 wt.-%.
The detergent formulations according to claim
1, characterized in that the components b) are included

with 5 to 20 wt.-%.
The detergent formulations according to claim
1, characterized in that from 5 to 50 wt.-% of washing

alkalis are included.
The detergent formulations according to claim
1, characterized in that from 5 to 60 wt.-% of fillers

are included.
Use of the formulations according to claim 1 as
detergents for textiles.
