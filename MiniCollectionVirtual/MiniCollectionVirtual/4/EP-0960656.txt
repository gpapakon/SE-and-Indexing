<ABSTRACT>
The wetting mechanism has several nozzle units arranged side by side in a first direction across the work direction and each having a controlled fluid supply. Each nozzle unit (4) has at least two nozzles (8,9) set behind each other in a second direction and attached by a pressure compensating device to the fluid supply (12). The pressure compensating device has a throttle arrangement (17) producing a drop in pressure which is greater than the sum of the remaining pressure drops in the nozzle unit.
