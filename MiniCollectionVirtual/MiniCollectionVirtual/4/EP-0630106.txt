<ABSTRACT>
An automatic gain control apparatus comprises a variable 
gain amplifier 5 amplifying a signal with an amplification 

factor and a gain controller 6 controlling the amplification 
factor of the variable gain amplifier 5. A gain limiter 7 is 

provided for restricting the magnitude of said amplification 
factor within a predetermined range. The amplification factor 

therefore does not vary largely, even immediately after the 
input signal level is suddenly changed due to switching of 

transmitter antenna or carrier frequency. Thus, it becomes 
possible to quickly respond to the change of input signal 

without requiring a large dynamic range in the circuit 
following the automatic gain control apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic gain
controller (AGC), preferably used for radio communication
receivers, and more particularly to an automatic gain
controller (AGC) which is capable of performing an adequate
gain control on an input signal whose amplitude changes steeply.The land mobile communication, such as portable
telephones and automobile telephones, is generally subjected
to severe electric field environment. To assure stable
communication under such severe conditions, digital modulation
systems and time division multiplexing (TDM) systems have been
recently adopted. Furthermore, employment of transmitter
antenna hopping and frequency hopping is now examined.The transmitter antenna hopping is characterized by
antenna extraction among a plurality of antennas provided on
a transmitter by which an optimum resultant signal is always
obtained even if communication conditions are changed or
worsened. Similarly, the frequency hopping is characterized
by frequency extraction among a plurality of carrier
frequencies for optimization of signal receiving condition. Meanwhile, radio communication receivers are equipped
with automatic gain controllers to adequately respond to the
change of input signal derived from variations of electric
field environment etc.A typical conventional radio communication receiver, to
perform automatic gain control, comprises, as shown in Fig. 3,
a receiver antenna 1 detecting a radio frequency band signal,
a receiver filter 2 extracting a desired frequency band signal
from the detected radio frequency band signal, a first-stage
amplifier 3 amplifying the extracted signal, a frequency
converter 4 converting an input signal from radio frequency
band to intermediate frequency band, a variable gain amplifier
5 amplifying an intermediate frequency band signal, and a gain
controller 6 controlling the variable gain amplifier 5.According to above-described conventional receiver, the
antenna 1 receives the radio frequency band signal A sent from
a transmitter (not shown), and outputs this radio frequency
band signal A to the receiver filter 2. The receiver filter
2 extracts a desired radio frequency band signal B from the
input radio frequency band signal A, and outputs this desired
radio frequency band signal B to the first-stage amplifier 3.
The first-stage amplifier 3 amplifies the extracted radio
frequency band signal B, and outputs an amplified signal C to
the frequency converter 4. The frequency converter 4 converts 
the radio frequency band signal C to an
