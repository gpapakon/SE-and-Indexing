<ABSTRACT>
The clean air issuing via the floor (5) of the cleaned room (1) is drawn in by a blower (9) which supplies the clean air via an inflow duct (11). Via the latter, the clean air passes through filters (3) in the ceiling region (2) and back into the clean room (1). The blower is an axial fan (9) designed for low pressure, towards which the clean air issuing from the clean room (1) flows. A preliminary filter is not required in the flow region between the clean room (1) and the blower (9). As a result, pressure losses caused by built-in components are considerably reduced in the flow region. Axial fans designed for low pressure and having a large flow cross-section and thus low dynamic pressure are therefore sufficient for the air circulation.

A clean-room installation comprising at least one clean room (1),
through which cle
an air flows, the clean air flowing through a floor
(5) of the clean room (1) and being drawn off by at least one fan

(9) supplying the clean air by means of at least one flow channel
(11), via which the clean air enters the clean room (1), passing

through filters (3) in the region of a ceiling (2), characterised in that
the fan (9) is an axial fan designed for low pressure, towards which

the clean air flows on leaving the clean room (1).
A clean-room installation according to claim 1, characterised in
that at least one flap device (12) is arranged upstream of the axial

fan (9) preferably housed in an adjoining room (10) of the clean-room
installation.
A clean-room installation according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that a sound reflector (31), preferably a ceiling, faces the

pressure side of the axial fan (9) at a distance therefrom
substantially at right angles to the flow direction of the clean air.
A clean-room installation according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the flow channel (11) is arranged at an

angle, preferably a right angle to the axis of the axial fan (9). 
A clean-room installation according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that at least one sound absorber (16) is arranged

upstream of the axial fan (9) and preferably comprises at least two
spaced plates (19 to 21) extending parallel to one another and

preferably arranged in the axial direction of the axial fan (9).
A clean-room installation according to claim 5, characterised in
that the plates (19 to 21) are of different lengths and/or different

thicknesses in the flow direction of the clean air.
A clean-room installation according to claim 5 or 6, characterised
in that the plates (19 to 21) comprise sound-absorbing material.
A clean-room installation according to claim 5 or 6, characterised
in that the plates (19 to 21) are each formed by at least one

membrane absorber.
A clean-room installation according to any one of claims 5 to 8,
characterised in that the ends of the plates (19 to 21), facing the

axial fan (9), are arranged at the same height.
A clean-room installation according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that at least one sound absorber (17) is arranged

on the pressure side of the axial fan (9) and preferably comprises
at least two spaced plates (28 to 30) extending parallel to one

another. 
A clean-room installation according to claim 10, characterised in
that the plates (28 to 30) are of different lengths and/or different

thicknesses in the flow direction of the clean air.

characterised in that the plates (28 to 30) are arranged at an

angle, preferably perpendicularly to the axial direction of the axial
fan (9).
A clean-room installation according to any one of claims 10 to 12,
characterised in that the plates (28 to 30) comprise sound-absorbing

material.
A clean-room installation according to any one of claims 10 to 12,
characterised in that the plates (28 to 30) are each formed by at

least one membrane absorber.
