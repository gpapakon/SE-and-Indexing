<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for ultrasonic sealing, comprising a 
drive unit connected to an A.C. current source, and a horn. Conventional devices for ultrasonic sealing normally consists of a converter a 
booster and a horn. In the converter, an electric oscillation is converted into a 
mechanical oscillation, the booster is employed to fix the system mechanically and 
boost the amplitude. In the horn, further amplitude boosting takes place, at the same 
time as the horn provides the desired sealing surface. These conventional, thoroughly 
well-tested ultrasonic sealing devices suffer, however, from the disadvantage of being 
relatively bulky. For certain practical applications, it is desirable to realize an ultrasonic 
sealing device which requires considerably less space. Within the packaging industry which deals with packages of the single-use 
disposable type, it is common to seal laminates with thermoplastic or pure 
thermoplastic material. These seals are normally carried out using heat or, when the 
laminate includes an aluminium foil, using induction heat. However it is desirable to be 
able to employ ultrasonic sealing, since this method does not require a laminate which 
includes a metal foil. The conventional ultrasonic sealing devices have however, proved 
to be far too bulky. A device for ultrasonic sealing, is known from US-A-4 995 938, 
disclosing an assembly consisting of an ultrasonic vibrator generating ultrasonic 
vibration and is shaped as a column. An ultrasonic vibration transmitter is coupled to 
the bottom of the ultrasonic vibrator coaxially thereto. A tool 3 is coupled to the bottom 
of the transmitter so as to perform machining by using ultrasonic vibration. However, 
this assembly constitutes one wave length or longer. Small-scale ultrasonic device sealing equipment has already been produced. 
However, these are rotation-symmetric and can only carry out spot-sealing. In the 
above-outlined application within the packaging industry, it is desirable to carry out 
transverse sealings of a certain length, i.e. a long and narrow seal.  
 One object of the present invention is to realize an ultrasonic sealing device 
which is of considerably smaller dimensions than conventional equipment and which is 
capable of executing a long and narrow sealing joint.  
 This and other objects have been attained according to the 
present invention in that the device of the type described by way of 
introduction has been given the characterizing features 
of claim 1. Preferred
