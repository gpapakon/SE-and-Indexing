<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to electrochromic 
polymeric solid films, manufacturing electrochromic 

devices using such solid films and processes for making 
such solid films and devices. The electrochromic 

polymeric solid films of the present invention exhibit 
beneficial properties and characteristics, especially 

when compared to known electrochromic media. The 
electrochromic polymeric solid films are transformed 
in 
situ
 from a low viscosity electrochromic monomer 
composition by exposure to electromagnetic radiation, 

and in so doing minimum shrinkage occurs. The 
electrochromic polymeric solid films of the present 

invention also perform well under prolonged coloration, 
outdoor weathering and all-climate exposure, and 

provide an inherent safety aspect not known to 
electrochromic media heretofore.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reversibly variable
electrochromic devices for varying the transmittance to
light, such as electrochromic rearview mirrors, windows
and sun roofs for motor vehicles, reversibly variable
electrochromic elements therefor and processes for
making such devices and elements.Reversibly variable electrochromic devices are known in
the art. In such devices, the intensity of light 
(e.g., visible, infrared, ultraviolet or other distinct
or overlapping electromagnetic radiation) is modulated
by passing the light through an electrochromic medium.
The electrochromic medium is disposed between two
conductive electrodes, at least one of which is
typically transparent, which causes the medium to
undergo reversible electrochemical reactions when
potential differences are applied across the two
electrodes. Some examples of these prior art devices
are described in United States Patents 3,280,701
(Donnelly); 3,451,741 (Manos); 3,806,229 (Schoot);
4,712,879 (Lynam) ("Lynam I); 4,902,108 (Byker)
("Byker I"); and I.F. Chang, "Electrochromic and
Electrochemichromic Materials and Phenomena", in
Nonemissive Electrooptic Displays, 155-96, A.R. Kmetz
and F.K. von Willisen, eds., Plenum Press, New York
(1976).Reversibly variable electrochromic media include those
wherein the electrochemical reaction takes place in a
solid film or occurs entirely in a liquid solution.
See e.g., Chang.Numerous devices using an electrochromic medium,
wherein the electrochemical reaction takes place
entirely in a solution, are known in the art. Some
examples are described in United States Patents
3,453,038 (Kissa); 5,128,799 (Byker) ("Byker II");
Donnelly; Manos; Schoot; Byker I; and commonly assigned
United States Patents 5,073,012 (Lynam) ("Lynam II");
5,115,346 (Lynam) ("Lynam III"); 5,140,455 (Varaprasad)
("Varaprasad I"); 5,142,407 (Varaprasad)
("Varaprasad II"); 5,151,816 (Varaprasad)
("Varaprasad III") and 5,239,405 (Varaprasad)
("Varaprasad IV"); and commonly assigned co-pending 
United States patent application Serial No. 07/935,784
(filed August 27, 1992)]. Typically, these
electrochromic devices, sometimes referred to as
electrochemichromic devices, are single-compartment,
self-erasing, solution-phase electrochromic devices.
See e.g., Manos, Byker I and Byker II.In single-compartment, self-erasing, solution-phase
electrochromic devices, the intensity of the
electromagnetic radiation is modulated by passing
through a solution held in a compartment. The solution
often includes a solvent, at least one anodic
