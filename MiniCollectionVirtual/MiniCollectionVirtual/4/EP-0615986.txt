<ABSTRACT>
Natural resin acid esters which have been modified by means of phenolic resins are obtained by reacting     A) natural resins or natural resin acids, B) monocyclic or polycyclic phenols which can be alkylolated (alkoxylated),   C) aldehydes or aldehyde acetals,   D) aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or araliphatic polyols,   E) magnesium compounds,   F) optionally fatty acids or fatty acid compounds, and   G) optionally ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbon resins, at a temperature of from 100 to 250 @C, and subsequently removing the water by azeotropic distillation by means of an entrainer at from 200 to 300 @C.

<CLAIMS>
A phenolic-resin-modified natural resin acid
ester, preparable by reaction of in each case at

least one compound from the substance groups

A) natural resins or natural resin acids,
B) mononuclear or polynuclear alkylolizable
phenols,
C) aldehydes or aldehyde acetals and
D) aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or araliphatic
alcohols having at least two hydroxyl groups

in the presence of
E) 0.01 to 1% by weight, calculated as MgO, of
magnesium compounds

   and if appropriate compounds from the substance
groups


F) fatty acids or fatty acid compounds and
G) ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbon resins
at a temperature of 100 to 250°C and subsequent

azeotropic removal of the water by distillation by
means of an entraining agent at 200 to 300°C.
A process for the preparation of a phenolic-resin-modified
natural resin acid ester as claimed in

claim 1 by reaction of

20 to 80% by weight of natural resins or natural
resin acids from substance group A), 
10 to 45% by weight of phenolic components from
substance group B),
2 to 20% by weight of aldehyde components from
substance group C),

   or, instead of the components from substance
groups B) and C) or as a proportion with these,

condensation products in a phenol-resol form
prepared separately from compounds of substance

groups B) and C),

1 to 20% by weight of polyol components from
substance group D),
0.01 to 1% by weight, calculated as MgO, of
magnesium compounds from substance group E),
0 to 30% by weight of fatty acid components from
substance group F),
0 to 30% by weight of hydrocarbon resin components
from substance group G)

together with
0.01 to 20% by weight of an inert entraining
agent,

   in each case based on the total amount of the
components employed.
A binder for printing inks comprising a reaction
product as claimed in claim 1, which is diluted

with mineral oil in a ratio of 1 part of resin to
99 parts of mineral oil, to 99 parts of resin to

1 part of mineral oil.
A binder for printing inks comprising a phenolic-resin-modified

natural resin acid ester as claimed
in claim 1, and additives chosen from colophony,

colophony esters, vegetable oils, alkyd resins,
phenolic resins and polystyrene.
The use of a phenolic-resin-modified natural resin
acid ester as claimed in claim 1 as a binder resin

in printing inks for offset printing and
letterpress printing.
