<ABSTRACT>
In a portable electrocardiograph (1) according to 
the present invention, a first measuring electrode (3) that 

is to be held by a hand during measurement and comes 
into contact with the palm is provided on a body case 

(1A). A second measuring electrode (6) that to be 
pressed against the chest is provided on an arm member 2 

provided on the body case (1A) in foldable manner. The 
arm member (2) is placed on the surface facing the body 

case (1A) when the arm member is folded onto the body 
case (1A). Therefore, to measure electrocardiographic 

waves with this electrocardiograph, the user has only to 
slide the arm member (2) into the opening between 

buttons on the front of his or her clothes or the 
opening in the shirt at the armpit, and then contacts 

the second measuring electrode (6) with his chest for 
measurement. Therefore, it is not necessary to apply 

the apparatus perpendicularly to the chest. The user 
has only to place the apparatus almost in parallel to 

the chest and press the second measuring electrode (6) 
against the left side of the heart in the chest. As a 

result, the user need not take off his or her clothes 
and can measure electrocardiographic waves easily and 

make quick measurement in case of heart attack. 
Furthermore, accurate measurement can also be effected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrocardiograph according to the preamble part of
claim 1.Such an electrocardiograph is known from FR-A1-2 666 977. This document
teaches a portable electrocardiograph which comprises a cabinet to which four arms
are pivot-mounted. At the end of each arm a sensor comprising a sucker and an
electrode is fixed.Since portable electrocardiographs are convenient
for keeping track of the state of electrocardiographic
waves in the cardiopath's everyday life, various types
have been developed.FIGS. 20 and 21 illustrate a conventional portable
electrocardiographic-wave measuring apparatus as known from US-A-4844090.
This electrocardiographic-wave measuring apparatus 100 has a
case body 110 formed into the shape of a pencil. For
portability, it can be put in and hung on a pocket with
a clip 120 at one end of the case body 110. A first
electrode 130 is provided on one end of the case body
110, and a second electrode 140 is provided on the
surface of the middle portion of the case body 110. A
press-button switch 150 is provided on the other end.
Inside the case body 110, the electronic circuitry that
measures electrocardiographic waves on the basis of the
signals from the first and second electrodes 130 and 140
and a battery are housed.FIG. 21 is an illustration to help explain how to
use the electrocardiographic-wave measuring apparatus
100. Electrocardiographic waves are measured by 
pressing the first electrode 130 against the chest to
the left side of the heart and pressing the switch 150,
with the second electrode 140 on the surface of the body
case 110 gripped with the right hand, for example. In
this way, electrocardiographic waves can be measured
whenever necessary.However, the conventional electrocardiographic-wave
measuring apparatus must have a relatively long body so
that the user can hold it with his or her right hand and
press the first electrode 130 against the chest. The
conventional apparatus has another problem: depending
on which part of the chest the first electrode 13 is
pressed against and how the electrode is pressed
against the chest, its contact resistance varies, and
consequently the change in the contact resistance causes
not only variations in the potential of the heart and
noise, but also myoelectric noise attributable to
muscular strain, preventing an accurate measurement of
electrocardiographic waves. To solve this problem, as
shown in FIG. 21, the electrocardiographic-wave
measuring apparatus 100 must be pressed perpendicularly
against the chest 170 to
