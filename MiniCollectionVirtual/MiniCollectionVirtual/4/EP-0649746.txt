<ABSTRACT>
A method of halftone printing with a thermal inkjet 
printer having a thermal inkjet printhead (19). The 

method includes the steps of determining a first pulse 
width and voltage that will cause the thermal inkjet 

printhead to deposit an ink drop having a first selected 
drop volume, operating the thermal inkjet printhead with 

said first pulse width and voltage to deposit an ink 
drop having the first selected drop volume, determining 

a second pulse width and voltage to produce a second 
selected drop volume that is different from said first 

selected drop volume, and operating the thermal inkjet 
printhead with said second pulse width and voltage to 

deposit an ink drop having the second selected drop 
volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of thermal 
inkjet printers and more particularly to controlling the 
ejected ink drop volume of thermal inkjet printheads. Thermal inkjet printers have gained wide acceptance. These 
printers are described by W.J. Lloyd and H.T. Taub in "Ink 
Jet Devices, " Chapter 13 of Output Hardcopy Devices 
(Ed. R.C. Durbeck and S. Sherr, San Diego: Academic Press, 
1988) and U.S. Patents 4,490,728 and 4,313,684. Thermal 
inkjet printers produce high quality print, are compact 
and  
 
portable, and print quickly and quietly because only ink 
strikes the paper. An inkjet printer forms a printed image by printing a 
pattern of individual dots at particular locations of an 
array defined for the printing medium. The locations are 
conveniently visualized as being small dots in a 
rectilinear array. The locations are sometimes "dot 
locations", "dot positions", or pixels". Thus, the 
printing operation can be viewed as the filling of a 
pattern of dot locations with dots of ink. Inkjet printers print dots by ejecting very small 
drops of ink onto the print medium, and typically include 
a movable carriage that supports one or more printheads 
each having ink ejecting nozzles. The carriage traverses 
over the surface of the print medium, and the nozzles are 
controlled to eject drops of ink at appropriate times 
pursuant to command of a microcomputer or other controller, 
wherein the timing of the application of the ink drops is 
intended to correspond to the pattern of pixels of the 
image being printed. Color thermal inkjet printers commonly employ a 
plurality of printheads, for example four, mounted in the 
print carriage to produce different colors. Each printhead 
contains ink of a different color, with the commonly used 
colors being cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. These base 
colors are produced by depositing a drop of the required 
color onto a dot location, while secondary or shaded colors 
are formed by depositing multiple drops of different base 
color inks onto the same dot location, with the 
overprinting of two or more base colors producing secondary 
colors according to well established optical principles. The typical thermal inkjet printhead (i.e., the 
silicon substrate, structures built on the substrate, and 
connections to the substrate) uses liquid ink (i.e., 
colorants dissolved or dispersed in a solvent). It has an 
array of precisely formed nozzles attached to a printhead  
 
substrate that incorporates an array of firing chambers 
which receive

A method of halftone printing with a thermal inkjet 
printer having a thermal inkjet printhead (19), 

comprising the steps of: 
Determining a first pulse width and voltage that will 

cause the thermal inkjet printhead to deposit ink drops 
having a first selected drop volume; 

controlling a voltage supply (13, 15) to provide said 
first pulse width and voltage; 

operating the thermal inkjet printhead with said first 
pulse width and voltage to deposit on a predetermined 

pixel array first ink drops each having the selected 
first drop volume; 

determining a second pulse width and voltage to produce 
a second selected drop volume; 

controlling the voltage supply to provide said second 
pulse width and voltage; and 

operating the thermal inkjet printhead with said second 
pulse width and voltage to deposit on the predetermined 

pixel array second ink drops each having the selected 
second drop volume; 

whereby a single thermal inkjet printhead is controlled 
to deposit ink drops of different drop volumes. 
A method of halftone printing with a thermal inkjet 
printer having a thermal inkjet printhead (19), 

comprising the steps of: 
determining a first pulse width and voltage that will 

cause the thermal inkjet printhead to deposit an ink 
drop having a first selected drop volume; 

operating the thermal inkjet printhead with said first 
pulse width and voltage to deposit an ink drop having 

 
the first selected drop volume; 

determining a secod pulse width and voltage to produce 
a second selected drop volume that is different from 

said first selected drop volume; 
operating the thermal inkjet printhead with said second 

pulse width and voltage to deposit an ink drop having 
the second selected drop volume; 

whereby a single thermal inkjet printhead is controlled 
to deposit ink drops of different drop volumes.

determining a third pulse width and voltage to produce 

a third selected drop volume which is different from 
the first selected drop volume and the second selected

operating the thermal inkjet printhead with said third 

pulse width and voltage to deposit an ink drop having 
the third selected drop volume.
