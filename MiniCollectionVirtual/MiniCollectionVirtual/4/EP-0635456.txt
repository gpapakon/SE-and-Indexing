<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for supplying nitrogen to at least two user sites, the requirements of which as regards nitrogen purity are different, according to which the following stages are carried out:   a) compressed air, originating from an air compressor (12), is passed over at least one air conditioning station (13) which makes it possible to carry out at least one of the following treatments:     - deoiling the air;   - filtering most of the particles from the air;   - drying the air; - optionally bringing the temperature of the air to the desired temperature;   b) the air resulting from Stage A) is conveyed to a first centralised gas separating unit (14), so as to produce, at the unit outlet, impure nitrogen of intermediate purity; c) the gas resulting from the centralised separating unit feeds a distribution line, to which are connected at least two use lines (3, 4), each containing a local gas separating unit (6, 7) on which the said gas is treated, so as to obtain, at the outlet of each local separating unit, nitrogen with a purity suited to the requirements of each of the user sites (9, 10) at the end of the line.

Method for providing nitrogen to at least two 
work stations whose needs in terms of nitrogen purity 

are different, which method includes the following 
steps: 


a) compressed air from an air compressor (12) 
is passed into at least one air conditioning 

station (13) which carries out at least one of the 
following treatments: 


removal of oil; 
filtering out of the majority of the 
particles; 
drying; 
optionally, setting of the temperature of the 
air to the desired temperature; 
b) the conditioned compressed air obtained at 
the end of step a) is conveyed to a centralized gas 

separation unit (14), so as to produce impure nitrogen 
of intermediate purity at the outlet of the unit; 
c) the gas obtained from the centralized separation 
unit (14) is directed to at least two lines of 

use (3 - 5), each containing a local gas separation 
unit (6 - 8), in which the said gas is again treated, 

so as to obtain at the outlet of each local separation 
unit nitrogen of a purity suited to the needs of each 

of the work stations (9, 10) at the end of the line. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the nitrogen produced by the end of the step b) 

contains a residual oxygen concentration which is 
within the range [1 %, 12 %]
, preferably within the 
range [3 %, 7 %]
. 
Method according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the nitrogen obtained at the outlet 

of each of the local separation units (6 - 8) contains 
a residual oxygen concentration which is within 

the range [500 ppm, 5 %]. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that at least one of the gas separation 

units (14; 6 - 8) used in step b) or c) is of the 

membrane type, the rest of the gas separation units 
then being of the adsorption type. 
Method according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that at least one of the gas separation 

units (14; 6 - 8) used in step b) or c) is of the 
adsorption type, the rest of the gas separation units 

then being of the membrane type. 
Method according to either of Claims 4 and 5, 
characterized in that the gas separation unit or units 

of membrane type respectively use membranes of variable 
characteristics. 
Method according to one of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that at least one of the membranes is 

of polyimide type. 
Method according to one of Claims 4 to 7, 
characterized in that the gas treated in each membrane 

separation unit is, if necessary, preheated, above room 
temperature, or cooled. 
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the temperature applied to the gas, if necessary, 

is different depending on whether it concerns the centralized 
separation unit of step b) or one of the local 

separation units of step c). 
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that: 


for the centralized separation unit, the  
 

temperature of the gas is maintained within the range 
[20°C, 90°C]
, preferably within the range [40°C, 60°C]; 
for a local separation unit, the temperature 
of the gas is maintained within the range [-60°C, 90°C]
 
and preferably within the range [15°C, 50°C]
.
