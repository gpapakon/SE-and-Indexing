<ABSTRACT>
Device for aerating and/or mixing water in a basin, 
using a means to impart a rotational motion to the water 

and having guide means (57) which convert the rotational 
motion into a combined horizontal and vertical motion of 

the water. 
Said guide means can be screw-shaped or plate-shaped 
elements of suitable shape and dimensions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method and a device for 
controlling the water motion in water basins and in particular 
in waste water basins. Aerators and/or mixers of various types have been 
described by the applicant in various documents. For 
example, Belgian patent 884.216 describes an aerator 
consisting of a power source mounted on a float and driving 
a shaft to which is attached a stirring organ consisting 
of a propeller with fixed or rotating diffusion 
head. According to another embodiment (Belgian patent 
893.687), the stirring organ consists of a combined impeller 
organ, consisting of a centrifugal impeller and a 
screw (screw pump). According to Belgian patent 88.01233 (publication 
1002575A5), the device is equipped with a second float, 
and the degree of submersion can be altered so that the 
device can be used either as an aerator or as a mixer. Surface aerators with a screw wheel or impeller 
organ normally make use of a suction cone without any  
 
guidance system, in order to lead the water to the pump 
housing. Since in addition to giving an upwards motion to the 
water sucked in, the impeller also gives the water a 
rotation motion in the pump housing, a vortex is freely 
induced underneath said suction cone. This vortex propagates 
itself as a result of friction between the different 
liquid layers, finally giving a horizontal rotation 
motion (fig. 1) to the entire basin. This favourably 
influences the mixing of the bottom layer, but the 
exchange between the oxygen-rich surface layer and the 
bottom layer is insufficient, so that the oxygen input 
performance is negatively influenced. For this reason, a cross is placed underneath the 
suction cone, consisting of one or more flat, vertical 
plates. Under the influence of this cross, a rotation 
motion is given to the water in each vertical plane 
through the vertical axis of the aerator, extending from 
the aerator to the wall, then to the bottom and back to 
the aerator (fig. 2). This gives maximum renewal of the 
surface and thus maximum oxygen input. However, the 
horizontal rotation motion which the vortex gives to the 
water in the basin is almost lost, so that mixing of the 
bottom layer is reduced. Since the horizontal motion is 
disturbed, the liquid must rise steeply from the bottom 
back to the device under the influence of the suction 
force, with the result that precipitable components - 
such as active sludge - cannot follow this motion completely, 
so that there is settling on the bottom. The 
input of oxygen is
