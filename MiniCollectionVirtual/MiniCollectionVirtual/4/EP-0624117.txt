<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a powered grinding tool primarily for 
effecting, for example, the sharpening, smoothing, cutting, abrading, 
honing etc., of implements, such as drill bits, scissors, knives, chisels, 
planar blades and the like. Whilst attachments for an electric drill are known which can 
carry out one or more of the various operations referred to above, their 
major disadvantage is of course that the drill cannot be used for its 
intended purpose whilst the attachment is fitted. Such a grinding device 
accessory is disclosed in U.K. Patent No. 1,233,340. U.K. Patent Specification No. 543,094 relates to a knife 
sharpening machine having a casing in which is housed an electric 
motor, a spindle driven by the motor extending to an outer end of the 
casing, at which it is fitted with an abrading wheel. A fixed guide part is 
secured to the casing to enclose the top of the abrading wheel, whilst a 
selected one of a number of interchangeable guide plates is releasably 
secured in place to complete the two-part guide which provides a slot 
into which a knife blade to be sharpened by the abrading wheel is 
introduced. The different guide plates determine the width of the slot 
and thereby the thickness of the knife blade to be introduced.  
 An object of the invention is to provide a powered grinding tool 
in an efficient and convenient manner. According to the invention there is provided a powered grinding 
tool comprising a casing, a motor within the casing, the motor adapted 
to be driven by power supply means, a rotatable shaft in drivable 
engagement with the motor, a rotatable grinding wheel to which drive is 
transmitted, in use, from said shaft, and the casing providing engagement 
means for temporarily securing a selected one of a number of adapters to 
the tool at a work station thereof, each adapter providing a location 
which, when the adapter is fitted to the tool at said work station, is 
disposed relative to the grinding wheel so that, in use, there is correct 
positioning between part of an implement at said location and said 
grinding wheel for said part to be worked by the wheel, characterised in 
that the engagement means are adapted to secure said selected adapter 
by guided sliding, so that said selected adapter is secured as an 
automatic snap-fit to the tool, in that there is manually operable catch 
means of the snap-fit allowing subsequent removal of the adapter from 
the tool, and in that the engagement means comprise a pair of spaced 
grooves or projections at the

<CLAIMS>
A powered grinding tool (10) comprising a casing (16), a motor 
(40) within the casing, the motor adapted to be driven by power supply 

means, a rotatable shaft (39) in drivable engagement with the motor, a 
rotatable grinding wheel (20) to which drive is transmitted, in use, from 

said shaft, and the casing providing engagement means for temporarily 
securing a selected one of a number of adapters (11, 12, 1 3) to the tool 

at a work station thereof, each adapter providing a location which, when 
the adapter is fitted to the tool at said work station, is disposed relative to 

the grinding wheel so that, in use, there is correct positioning between 
part of an implement at said location and said grinding wheel for said 

part to be worked by the wheel, characterised in that the engagement 
means are adapted to secure said selected adapter by guided sliding, so 

that said selected adapter is secured as an automatic snap-fit to the tool, 
in that there is manually operable catch means (1 7) of the snap-fit 

allowing subsequent removal of the adapter from the tool, and in that the 
engagement means comprise a pair of spaced grooves (24) or projections 

at the casing with which a pair of spaced complementary projections (25) 
or grooves respectively of a selected adapter (11, 12, 13) engages, in use. 
A tool as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the casing (16) has 
storage means for releasably storing at least one of said adapters (11, 12, 

13) when the or each adapter is not fitted to the tool at said work station. 
A tool as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the location provided by 
each of said adapters is intended for use with part of a specific 

implement or respective parts of specific implements only, so that by  
 

means of said number of adapters, a number of different implements are 
intended to be used with the tool. 
A tool as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein each 
adapter (11, 12, 13) has a lower portion (93) extending from its location, 

the lower portion being of generally channel shape having spaced sides, 
respective means (25) at said sides being engageable, in use, with 

respective co-operating means (24) at the casing to retain the adapter at 
said work station against lateral movement. 
A tool as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the lower portion (93) of 
each adapter and a base (14) of the tool have respective releasable interengaging 

parts (48, 18) to prevent longitudinal movement of the adapter 
when it is fitted at said work station. 
A tool as claimed in Claim 4, wherein said engagement means 
at the sides of an adapter and at the casing are projections (25) and 

complementary undercut slots (24) respectively or vice versa. 
A tool as claimed in Claim 6, wherein said casing is four sided, 
having said undercut slots (24) or said complementary projections (25) at 

one side defining said work station, and also at least one other side. 
A tool as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the casing (16) is snap-fittingly engaged with a base (14) of the tool. 
A tool as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
said shaft (39) is directly driven by the motor (40), in use, one end of the  

 
shaft projecting out of the casing at said work station and having said 

grinding wheel (20) attached thereto. 
A tool as claimed in Claim 9, wherein the other end of the shaft 
(39) is disposed in the casing and upon rotation of the shaft, in use, 

drives a fan (46) in the casing. 
A tool as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the power supply means is mains power. 
A tool as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the power supply is battery power.
