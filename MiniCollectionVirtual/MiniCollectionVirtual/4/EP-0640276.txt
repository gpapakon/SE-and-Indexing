<ABSTRACT>
Method for the combine-harvesting of cereals, for simultaneous soil-working, for the simultaneous sowing of seed into or onto the soil, for the simultaneous covering of the seed with soil and for the simultaneous re-consolidation of the soil in the same operation and a machine/implement combination for carrying out the method, formed from a combine harvester (1), a soil-working appliance (4) with seed-introducing and soil-reconsolidating implements, and a seed drill (5), the soil-working appliance (4) with associated working implements being arranged preferably in the region underneath the reaper table (1.1) and/or the reapings conveyor channel (1.2) of the combine harvester (1) and so as to be vertically raiseable and lowerable together with the former by the lifting device specific to the combine harvester, by means of appropriately designed and mounted brackets (2) and coupling parts (3), and extending approximately over the entire cutting width of the combine harvester (1), and, furthermore, the seed drill (5) being arranged preferably between the front and the rear row of working implements of the soil-working appliance (4) on the latter by means of connecting members (42).
