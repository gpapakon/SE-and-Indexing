<ABSTRACT>
Buckle comprising a lever/tensioner (4) articulated on a base (1) and having a longitudinal notch (6) in which a tie (7) connected to an attaching member (10) is articulated. The notch (6) and the tie (7) are offset laterally with respect to the median longitudinal axis of the lever/tensioner in the direction of the side of the buckle intended to be arranged towards the rear of the boot, whilst the other side of the lever/tensioner has a decreasing height forming a ramp (16, 16a) on which the slalom poles encountered by the boot can slide without risk of catching or opening the buckle.

<CLAIMS>
A buckle for a ski boot, comprising a tensioning lever (4) 
which is articulated onto a base (1) and has a longitudinal 

notch (6) in which a link rod (7), which is also connected to a 
fastening member (10), is articulated, characterised in that 

the notch (6) of the tensioning lever, and consequently also 
the link rod (7), are laterally offset relative to the 

longitudinal mid-axis of the tensioning lever (4), toward the 
side of the buckle which is intended to be arranged toward the 

rear of the boot, and in that the part of the tensioning lever 
located on the side opposite the notch has, over at least a 

part of its width, a height which decreases toward the side 
intended to be arranged toward the front of the boot. 
The buckle as claimed in claim in 1, characterised in that 
the decreasing height is given by a chamfer (16). 
The buckle as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the fastening member (10) also has a height which decreases 

from its side (17) corresponding to the side of the tensioning 
lever having decreasing height.
