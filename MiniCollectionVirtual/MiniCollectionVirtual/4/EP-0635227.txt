<ABSTRACT>
A chair has a chair column (4) on which a front seat carrier part (6) is fixedly arranged. To the latter there is attached, by means of a pivot shaft (8), a rear seat carrier part (7) which in turn carries a backrest carrier (14) for a backrest. A seat (10) is supported on the two seat carrier parts (6, 7). The seat (10) is supported in relation to the rear seat carrier part (7) via a supporting shaft (12') which is adjustable in height relative to the rear seat carrier (7) by means of a seat inclination-adjusting device (13). The seat inclination-adjusting device (13) may be in the form of a retrofit kit.
