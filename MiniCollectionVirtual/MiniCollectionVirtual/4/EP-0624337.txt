<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a dispenser for a fluid from a toilet paper dispenser (holder) (10) with an integrated fluid container. Previous dispensing devices required, for continuously variable metering of fluid, a construction which, due to a larger number of individual parts, was too complex in terms of production and ergonomics. Essentially, the dispenser comprises a valve part (1) which is composed of a ring with three plastic lips (3) and a vertical rod (2). The lips act resiliently on the rod. The rod has at the upper end a thickened portion (4) which closes the channel (6) in the middle part (5). When the end unit (7) is pushed up, the latter acts on the lower end of the rod (2) and thereby opens the channel (6). All of the parts of this dispenser are of the plug-in type and are produced from polyethylene. The entire dispenser in turn can be fitted into the base of the toilet paper dispenser (10).
