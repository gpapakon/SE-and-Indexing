<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inverter circuit for use
with a discharge tube or lamp such as a cold-cathod
fluorescent lamp, a hot-cathod fluorescent lamp, a mercury arc
lamp, a metal halide lamp, a neon lamp or the like.It is necessary for turning on such a discharge tube or lamp
to use a commercial AC power supply or a high-voltage power
supply utilizing a commercial AC power supply and a lighting
or starting circuit comprising a ballast for limiting a
current. Recently, for the sake of miniaturizing such
starting circuits and also of popularizing portable type
devices or apparatus such as small size liquid crystal display
devices each utilizing a discharge lamp, for example, as a
back lighting source, various inverter circuits have been used
for obtaining a high-voltage power supply from a low-voltage
DC power source thereby turning on a discharge tube.A capacitive ballast or an inductive ballast may be used in
such an inverter circuit for a discharge tube, and a
capacitive capacitor has generally been used as a ballast. While an inverter cirucit for a discharge tube of smaller size
is required because of making portable equipments small in
size and light in weight, it is known in general that
peripheral components or parts such as a step-up transformer,
capacitor and the like can be miniaturized by making a driving
frequency for an inverter circuit higher so that the whole of
an inverter circuit can be miniaturized in size.However, as the driving frequency becomes higher, the
influence of a parasitic or stray capacitance caused by a
secondary winding of a step-up transformer, wiring or the like
cannot be ignored.In addition, in many cases, a closed magnetic flux type core,
namely, an EI type core consisting of two magnetic pieces of E
and I shapes or an EE type core consisting of two magnetic
pieces of E and E shapes has been adopted as that of a step-up
transformer used in an inverter circuit for a discharge tube
on the basis of fundamental circuit design or plan in which a
leakage of magnetic flux is considered to be harmful in
efficiency.It is a step-up transformer that occupies the largest space in
an inverter circuit for a discharge tube, and the difficulty
of miniaturization in size of the step-up transformer makes it
impossible to miniaturize the whole inverter circuit in size.Hence in order to reduce the step-up transformer in size, as 
the driving frequency for the inverter circuit for a
discharge tube is made higher, a parasitic or stray
capacitance or capacitances caused in a
