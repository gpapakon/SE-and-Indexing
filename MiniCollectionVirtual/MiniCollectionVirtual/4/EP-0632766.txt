<ABSTRACT>
There is described, in thermograhic recording films, the use of a compound containing at least two epoxide moieties in the protective layer and/or in a layer on top of the protective layer of thermographic recording films to reduce gouging and streaking of the printed image film and to reduce head build-up on the thermal printhead.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermographic
recording films, and more specifically, it relates to
the use of a crosslinking compound containing at least
two epoxide moieties in a protective layer and/or in a
layer on top of the protective layer of certain
thermographic recording films which are to be imaged
with a thermal printhead. The crosslinking compound
helps to prevent gouging, to reduce head build-up on the
thermal printhead, enhance print performance and to
improve the image quality of the printed image.There are disclosed in the art a number of
image-forming systems for use in thermographic recording 
films. One of these image-forming systems utilizes
color-forming di- and triarylmethane compounds
possessing certain S-containing ring closing moieties,
namely a thiolactone, dithiolactone or thioether ring
closing moiety as are disclosed in European Patent No.
250,558 and U.S. Patent No. 5,196,297 of E.J.
Dombrowski, Jr. etal. These dye precursors undergo
coloration by contacting with a Lewis acid material,
preferably a metal ion of a heavy metal, particularly
silver, capable of opening the S-containing ring moiety
to form a colored metal complex.As disclosed in the above-cited patents, the
ability of these dye precursors to form a colored dye
almost instantaneously when contacted with Ag+ renders
them eminently suitable for use as color formers in
thermal imaging systems employing organic silver salts,
such as silver behenate. These thermographic recording
films preferably include a heat-fusible organic acid
material. U.S. Patent No. 4,904,572 of E.J. Dombrowski,
Jr. etal, issued February 27, 1990, discloses 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid as a preferred heat-fusible
organic acid.The above described thermal color-forming
system preferably employs a thermoplastic binder, e.g.
polyvinylbutyral. When imagewise heating is
accomplished by means of a thermal printhead, the
thermoplastic binder is in direct contact with the
thermal printhead during imaging. Since thermoplastic
binders soften upon the application of heat, they tend
to stick to the thermal printhead during imaging. This
"sticking" interferes with the printing, adversely
affects image quality, and can cause damage to the
printhead. A number of ways to prevent sticking between a
binder and a thermal printhead during printing have been
suggested for various thermographic recording films.
Many of these employ a protective or anti-stick topcoat
comprising silica over the thermographic color-forming
layer. These topcoats contact the thermal
