<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit device (10) for 
comparing (at C1 to C96) the state of a large number 

of inputs (1 to 32), i.e. "discretes", against any 
one of a plurality of selectable voltage levels. 

The compared data is examined in a 3x3 matrix format 
(CH1 FFD-1 to FFD-3, CH2 FFD-1 to FFD-3, CH# FFD-1 

to FFD-3). In a redundant mode, comparators are 
utilized in a triple-redundant configuration to 

obtain a consensus on input states, at three 
successive time intervals, raising a flag when 

consensus fails. Inputs, whether in a redundant or 
non-redundant mode are distributed along three 

different sides of a rectangular-shaped substrate to 
prevent catastrophic mechanical failures. In the 

redundant mode, discretes are compared using a 
voting technique (V1) such that when all three 

levels are the same, an error free status is 
provided, whereas a two-out-of-three vote is 

interpreted as correct but with an indication that 
the discrete being monitored requires further 

checking. Data, fault and self-test results are 
made available to the outside world by a 

parallel/serial transmitter (SPC-1) and in parallel 
form by discrete output terminals (DATA {15:0}). 

Output data is compared with data inputted for 
further assuring integrity of the device (FAULT). 

Output data is selectable in either an eight bit or 
sixteen bit tri-state port (TS-1 to TS-12), which is 

addressable for channel data, status, bounds, 
mismatch, built-in self-test and major fault 

information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
monitoring device and more particularly to a multichannel 
discrete to digital interface for monitoring 
a plurality of discretes at a selectable variety of 
monitoring rates and capable of checking data 
accuracy, switched states and a plurality of test 
conditions, consensus information being provided 
when operating in a redundant mode. A number of applications exists wherein it 
is desirable to provide monitoring capabilities for 
monitoring the states of a plurality of devices, 
such as, for example, the states of relays, switches 
and the like. For example, some very severe restrictions 
exist in the avionics field in which it is desired 
to monitor a plurality of discretes, a discrete 
being defined as "a separate, complete and distinct 
signal". Such signals are typically binary, on or 
off, 28 V-based signals, typically: open/ground, 28 
V/open or 28 V/ground and with a very, low band 
width, typically of the order of DC to 200 Hz.  Although the translation of such signals 
to TTL-levels, which are compatible with digital 
avionics may seem simple, lightning and high 
intensity radiated fields (HIRF) and RTCA DO-160C 
power complicate the ability to translate such 
signals to TTL-levels. Present day, conventional systems utilize 
tailored circuits for an interface, each interface 
being typically comprised of R-C input filters, 
divider networks, diode isolation and a comparator. 
Multi-channel interface to a processor requires 
still additional logic and latches. It is further 
desirable to provide a standardized, addressable and 
reliable interface. The resulting designs generally 
lack built-in test capabilities consume considerable 
space, typically up to one square inch per channel 
and offer no chip-level redundancy. The present invention achieves all of the 
desired objectives set forth hereinabove as well as 
eliminating or significantly reducing the 
disadvantages of conventional tailored circuitry and 
is characterized by comprising a multi-channel 
discrete interface with universal HIRF-isolated 
inputs having the capability of handling 28 V/open, 
open/ground and 28 V/ground signals. Comparators 
are arranged in a triple redundant configuration and 
are coupled to input pads arranged about three sides 
of a substantially rectangular-shaped substrate to 
reduce the effect of a catastrophic hardware fault. The interface, in a redundancy mode takes 
a consensus of input states and raises a flag when 
consensus fails.  The interface provides a
