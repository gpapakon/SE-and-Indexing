<ABSTRACT>
A transport network with an annular layout and objects which can be moved automatically on this layout is disclosed. The transport network is designed for transporting uniform freight containers at constant speed. It has loading and unloading points at which freight containers can be inserted into or removed from the transport flow without other freight containers having to be braked or stopped in order to permit this. The transport lines run preferably in elevated fashion over existing railway lines or motorways or in underground pipes and cover heavily populated areas or entire states or parts of states. In relatively large layout rings, subrings which shorten the transport paths can be provided by means of crossconnections.
