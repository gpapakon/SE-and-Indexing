<ABSTRACT>
The ceramo-metallic composite material includes a ceramic phase with particles of alumina or of an alumina-based solid solution, a refractory phase comprising titanium nitride and/or carbonitride, and a metallic matrix based on Ni, Co, Fe. The interface between the alumina particles or alumina solid solution and the metallic matrix is rich in nitrogen and in titanium or in compounds thereof.

Process for manufacturing a sintered ceramo metallic composite
material comprising a ceramic phase with particles of alumina or of a

solid solution based on alumina, a refractory phase including titanium
nitride and/or carbonitride, and a metallic matrix based on Ni, Co, Fe,

the interface between the particles of alumina or of solid solution of
alumina and the metallic matrix being rich in nitrogen and in titanium or

in compounds thereof, characterised by the fact that it comprises the

nitrogen, at a temperature of 1300 to 1600°C and under a pressure of 1
to 2000 Mpa, and by the fact that said interface rich in nitrogen and

titanium or in compounds thereof is formed in situ during the sintering

alumina, at a temperature comprised between 950 to 1600°C and in the
presence of carbon.
A process according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that said
interface is formed by a continuous layer which is rich in TiN around the

and 50 µm, or of whiskers or filaments.
A process according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that the
volume content of the ceramic phase is comprised between 10 and

80%, preferably 20 and 50%, that of the refractory phase between 10
and 70% and that of the metallic matrix between 3 and 50%.
A process according to claim 4, characterized by the fact that the
volume content of the ceramic phase is comprised between 5 and 30%,
