<ABSTRACT>
An ascending and descending device for lowering and raising persons or loads on a rope, having an abseil pulley (2) around which a rope (1) is wound and which is arranged on a supporting pin (5) so as to be freely rotatable in the one direction of rotation and locked in the other direction by means of a free-wheel and non-reversing lock in such a way that, when the load to be lowered on the rope acts on one end of the rope, the rope slides on the locked abseil pulley and the frictional force developing here brakes the load and, when a tensile force acts on the other end of the rope, the abseil pulley runs freely. The ascending and descending device is to be designed in such a way that incorrect positions of the rope windings can be eliminated so that the functional reliability of the device is improved. This is brought about by the rope pulley being enclosed by an essentially tubular component (3), the distance between the tubular component and the rope being less than the rope diameter, and the tubular component having two slot-like openings (7, 8) through which the two ends of the rope run. Here, the rope guide surfaces (9a, 9b) are conveniently arranged on the inside of the tubular component. In addition, the tubular component can contain a viewing slot which enables the number of rope windings to be checked. It is especially advantageous to form the tubular component from a transparent material.

Rope guiding device for the pulling up and letting down 
of persons or loads with a letting-down pulley (2) around 

which a rope (1) is wound and which is disposed on a 
support bolt (5) so as to be freely rotatable in one 

direction and blocked in the other direction by means of 
freewheeling and back stop in such a way that when the 

load (L) to be let down engages with one end of the rope, 
said rope slides on the blocked letting-down pulley and 

due to the friction force thereby created a braking of 
the load takes place, and when a
 tensile force (H) 
engages with the other end of the rope (1) the letting-down 

pulley moves freely in sympathy, wherein the rope 
pulley is surrounded by an essentially tube-shaped 

component whose inner spacing from the rope (1) is less 
than the rope diameter,
 
characterised in that
 
the tube-shaped component (3) has two slot-type openings 

(7, 8) through which the two ends (H, L) of the rope (1) 
run, wherein the slot (7) for the hand-side end (H) of 

the rope (1) extends in the peripheral direction of the 
tube-shaped component (3). 
Rope guiding device according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the slot (7) for the hand-side end (H) of the 

rope (1) bears a rounding (7a). 
Rope guiding device according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that rope guiding surfaces (9a, 9b) are 

disposed on the inside of the tube-shaped component (3). 
Rope guiding device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the tube-shaped component 

(3) bears a viewing slot extending in the axial direction 
of the latter.  

 
Rope guiding device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the tube-shaped component (3) 

consists of a transparent material.
