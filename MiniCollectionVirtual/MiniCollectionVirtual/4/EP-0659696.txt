<ABSTRACT>
Method for reducing pollutant and ammonium contents, also chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), of waste water from composting comprises:(a) sepg. solids and sludge from the water;(b) allowing the water to trickle down, at least once, under gravity, through a heap of biomass( from composting) of particle size 
>
25mm; (c) collecting the water at the bottom of the heap and freeing it of solids and sludge; and (d) discharging part of the water; (e) passing the off- air from the composting operation upwards through the heap to provide conditions for aerobic fermentation and to keep the water at 25-35 deg C; (f) purifying the gas in a biofertiliser before discharging it into the environment.

A process of reducing the content of noxious substances
and of lowering the ammonium content as well as the CSB

and BSB
5
 values in the composting effluent, wherein

a) the composting effluent is separated from solids,
b) the effluent is liberated from sludge and is subsequently
at least once applied from to the top onto a

filling formed of the biomass from the composting
with a particle size 
>
 25 mm and under the influence
of gravity seeps through between the particles of the

filling and flows out to the bottom, the effluent
loaded with sludge and solids is separated from solids

and sludge, and part of the amount of water is
discharged,
c) for achieving an aerobic fermentation, the exhaust
air from the composting is passed as an air stream

from the bottom to the top through the filling in accordance
with process stage (b), and the effluent is

adjusted to a temperature of 25째C to 35째C by means of
the exhaust air,
d) the exhaust air from the purification in accordance
with process stage (b) is purified in a biofilter and

discharged to the environment.
The process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
the pH value in process stage (b) is adjusted to 8 to 11

by adding lime milk or sodium hydroxide solution. 
The process as claimed in claims 1 or 2, characterized in
that the effluent in accordance with process stage (c) is

adjusted to a temperature of 28째C to 32째C.
The process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the application of the effluent onto the filling in

accordance with process stage (b) is effected in a closed
insulated container.
The process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the amount of the composting effluent separated from

solids in accordance with process stage (a) is adjusted
to be smaller than or equal to the amount of the effluent

discharged in accordance with process stage (b).
The process as claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the introduction and discharge as well as the recirculation

of the effluent in accordance with process stage
(b) is effected continuously.
The process as claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the used filling in accordance with process stage

(b) is transferred to the composting.
Use of the biomass from the composting with a particle
size 
>
 25 mm as filling for the process as claimed in
claims 1 to 7.
