An equipment having a heatable pressure-drum (1) and an endless
metallic pressure-belt (2) which is led over guiderolls and encloses

the pressure-drum (1) over part of its circumference to form a pressure
section (P) for the material to be compressed, the latter being heated

above the setting temperature of the binder and at least one hydraulic
pressure equipment in the shape of at least one pressure-shoe being provided,

which acts with a certain superficial pressure upon the pressure
belt (1) over part of the circumference of the pressure-drum (1), whilst

the pressure-shoe or shoes (10, 13, 14, 15) exhibit bearing areas (11)
lubricated hydrostatically by lubricant at a certain pressure so that the

pressure-belt (2) is capable of sliding almost without friction over the
pressure-shoe or shoes (10, 13, 14, 15), characterized in that

for the continuous production of chipboard, fibreboard, or the like
from comminuted lignocellulose- or cellulose-containing raw material (5)

mixed with a pressure-setting and/or thermo-setting binder, the pressure
shoe or shoes form with the pressure-drum (1) a gradually narrowing entry

zone (E) and a succeeding region extending as the pressure section (P)
over a certain arc of the pressure-drum (1) at approximately uniform

pressure and/or distance from the pressure-drum.
An equipment as in Claim 1, characterized in that

   in the pressure section (P) directly adjacent to the first pressure-shoe
(10) at least one further pressure-shoe (13, 14, 15) is arranged,

having a hydrostatic bearing area with adjustable pressure.
An equipment as in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that

   by means of an adjuster device (23) the pressure-shoe is or shoes are
adjustable in their direction of pressure against the pressure-drum (1).
An equipment as in Claim 3, characterized in that

   the adjuster device (23) exhibits a pressure-chamber supplied with
pressure medium so that the pressure-shoe (10, 13, 14, 15) is movable

over it.
An equipment as in one of the Claims 1 - 4, characterized in that

   the pressure-shoe (10) exhibits at its front end (25) before the
entry zone (E) a preheat zone (C) in which the pressure-belt (2) slides

over a surface exhibiting a hydrostatic bearing pocket (26) supplied with 
hot pressure medium, and thus becomes heated.
An equipment as in one of the Claims 1 - 5, characterized in that

   in the pressure section (P) after the last pressure-shoe (15) a
shaper-roll (16) is arranged, which exerts upon the pressure-belt (2)

a higher pressure than the last pressure-shoe (15).
An equipment as in one of the Claims 1 - 6, characterized in that

   the shaper-roll (6) and/or the pressure-drum (1) exhibits a non-rotating
bearer (16, 19) and a jacket (17, 20) rotatable with respect to the

latter and supported by at least one supporting element (18, 21) with
adjustable supporting force.
An equipment as in Claim 7, characterized in that

   the shaper-roll (6) and/or the pressure-drum (1) exhibits a number of
supporting elements (18) arranged side by side in the axial direction and

having individually adjustable supporting force.
An equipment as in Claim 7, characterized in that

   the shaper-roll (6) is adjustable in the direction of motion of the
pressure-belt (2).
An equipment as in one of the Claims 1 - 4, characterized in that

   the shaper-roll (6) and/or the pressure-drum (1) exhibits at its
pressure side a part-space, especially a half-space (h, H) which is

sealed by sealing strips (24) and may be filled with pressure fluid.
