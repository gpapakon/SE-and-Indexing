<ABSTRACT>
A polyimide varnish which is a solution having a 
polyimide and/or a polyimide precursor dissolved in an 

organic solvent and which is useful for forming a 
polyimide coating film on a substrate by coating the 

solution on the substrate followed by heat treatment, 
wherein from 5 wt% to 60 wt% of the organic solvent is a 

lactic acid derivative of the formula (I): 

wherein each of R¹ and R² which are independent of each 
other, is hydrogen, a C₁₋₅ alkyl group or a C₁₋₅ alkenyl 

group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyimide varnish. 
More particularly, it relates to a polyimide varnish 
which is a solution having a polyimide and/or a polyimide 
precursor dissolved in an organic solvent and which is 
useful for forming a smooth polyimide coating film on a 
substrate by coating the solution on the substrate 
followed by heat treatment. By virtue of their characteristic high mechanical 
strength, heat resistance and solvent resistance, 
polyimides are widely used as protecting materials or 
insulating materials in the electric and electronic 
fields. They are usually used to form thin polyimide 
coating films on various substrates. Specifically, when 
they are used as insulating films for semiconductors, 
they are usually used to form polyimide coating films of 
from 1 µm to 10 µm on silicon substrates having wirings 
applied thereto, and when they are used as liquid crystal 
alignment films, they are usually used to form polyimide 
coating films of from 0.05 µm to 0.2 µm on transparent  
 
substrates provided with transparent electrodes. To form 
such a polyimide coating film, it is common to coat on a 
substrate a polyimide varnish obtained by dissolving a 
polyimide or a polyimide precursor in a suitable organic 
solvent, by a method such as spin coating, offset 
printing or gravure printing, followed by heat treatment. When a polyimide coating film is formed on a 
substrate, fluidity of the solution after coating is 
important to form a smooth film, since the irregularities 
on the coating film surface will be smoothed by the flow 
of the solution. However, conventional solvents for polyimides usually 
have a high surface tension, whereby the fluidity is 
rather poor. Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 
81167/1992 proposes a method of incorporating butyl 
cellosolve to lower the surface tension of the solution. 
However, butyl cellosolve is not preferred from the 
practical viewpoint, since its toxicity is pointed out. Under the circumstances, it is an object of the 
present invention to provide a polyimide varnish which is 
a solution of a polyimide and/or a polyimide precursor 
and which is useful for forming a polyimide coating film 
to be used, for example, as an insulating film or a 
protective film for an electrical or electronic device or 
as a liquid crystal alignment film, by coating the 
solution on a substrate, whereby a smooth polyimide 
coating film can be formed.  
 Thus, the present invention provides a polyimide 
varnish having a polyimide and/or a
