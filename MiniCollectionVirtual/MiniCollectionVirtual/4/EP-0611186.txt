<ABSTRACT>
Shoulder weapon, with a long recoil travel, for firing high impulse ammunition, comprising a gun closed by a movable breech, a recoil damping system, and an automatic or semi-automatic reloading device, characterised in that:   - the assembly consisting of the gun (1), its movable breach (2) and the part (3) for driving this movable breach slides, by means of runners (9), on a cradle (7) which is integral with the stock (8); and in that it includes: - a shoulder safety plate (22) which, at rest, locks the percussion mechanism, the latter being released by pushing in this plate when the firer supports the weapon against his shoulder and; - an actuator (37) positioned in the front handle (14) of the weapon in order to control the starting of the firing sequence after sighting, this actuator, when it is not operated, locking the striker (23).

<CLAIMS>
Shoulder-held weapon with long recoil, for firing high-impulse 
munitions, comprising a barrel closed by a movable breech, a 

recoil damping system, and an automatic or semiautomatic 
reloading device, in which the assembly constituted of the 

barrel (1), its movable breech (2) and the operating piece (4) 
for this movable breech, slides, by means of skids (9), on a 

cradle (7) integral with the stock (8), the weapon comprising in 
addition a safety plate (22) which when at rest locks the 

percussion mechanism, the latter being released by pushing-in of 
this plate by the firer, characterized in that said safety plate 

(22) is positioned in such a way as to release the percussion 
mechanism comprising a striking pin (23) when the firer rests 

the weapon against his shoulder, pushing in said plate, and in 
that said weapon comprises an actuator (37) positioned in the 

front grip (14) of the weapon for operating the starting-up of 
the firing sequence after aiming, this actuator, when it is not 

operated, locking the striking pin (23). 
Weapon according to claim 1, characterized in that the shoulder 
safety plate (22) is mounted on a shoulder plate (21) provided 

in the stock, and faced with an energy-absorbing material. 
Weapon according to claim 2, characterized in that said shoulder 
plate (21) is faced with a material that not only absorbs energy 

but also automatically adapts to the body shape of the firer. 
Weapon according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the operating piece (4) of the movable 

breech (2) is connected to the damping system, this connection 
being so designed as to ensure the locking or unlocking of the 

breech by displacement of the barrel (1) once the weapon is in 
counter-recoil.  

 
Weapon according to Claim 4, characterized in that a restoring 
spring (16) is provided, acting on the barrel to ensure automatic 

reloading of the weapon when the breech is released after counter-recoil, 
by the forward movement of the barrel resulting from the 

counter-recoil energy of the weapon. 
Weapon according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that the recoil damping system is of the cylindrical type with 

friction acting in the sense of the recoil and free in the opposite 
sense, this system comprising a damping and friction braking 

cylinder (10) sliding on a guide rod (7), the backward return being 
assured by a helical spring (12) bearing against the damping 

cylinder (10) and against the stock (8), this spring being positioned 
on the guide rod (7). 
Weapon according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the recoil damping system comprises a fixed cylinder mounted 

on a movable rod connected to the breech, a restoring means, notably 
of pneumatic type, assuring the forward return of the rod entraining 

the breech. 
Weapon according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that the firing mechanism is constituted of a floating striking 

pin (23) with spring return, situated in the movable breech (2), 
this striking pin being actuated by a hammer (25) provided with a 

spring (27), this hammer being capable of engaging into a double 
escapement system (28, 28') connected to the trigger (31), said 

hammer articulated on the cradle (7) being locked in the armed 
position by a cam (33) governed by the shoulder safety plate (22). 
Weapon according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that it is of the automatic loading type and it comprises a 

magazine (18) provided with several munitions (19), this magazine 
being positioned at the rear of the weapon, at the location at 

which the recoil of the barrel-breech assembly takes place, which  
 

assembly, being able to recoil through an opening provided in the 
magazine, the feed of a new cartridge into the firing chamber 

taking place during the counter-recoil of the barrel after extraction 
and ejection of the empty cartridge case. 
Weapon according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that it is equipped with an aiming system which contains a 

brilliant viewfinder with projected reticle (34), a laser rangefinder 
(35), a goniometer, preferably operating by magnetic flux 

variation, and a computer (36) containing a memory, into which the 
ballistic data of the munitions are fed, the fire control being 

started by actuating said contacter (37). 
Weapon according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that it uses munitions each provided with a ballistic identification 

code such as, notably, an optically read barcode, the 
information of which is transmitted to said computer (36) during 

the aiming operations. 
Weapon according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that the movable safety plate is connected to the trigger by 

means of a cam and a cable, the connection being such that the 
trigger, having no pivot axis, uses this cam as pivot axis, in such 

a way that said trigger shall be retracted and inoperative in the 
at-rest position, when the weapon is not placed at the shoulder, 

and that it shall be in the active position when the weapon is 
placed at the shoulder, the cam then serving as pivot axis. 
Weapon according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that said actuator (37) is constructed in such a manner 

as to act upon a safety bolt for the striking pin (23).
