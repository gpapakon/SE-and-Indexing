<ABSTRACT>
Vegetable foodstuffs such as potatoes, beetroot, carrots and other root vegetables, are preserved by treating with a non-toxic food acid solution of pH 3.8 or less, and then sealing in a container, the treated foodstuff having been sterilised by heat and having been blanched. The pH of the treated foodstuff is no more than about 4.8.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TREATMENT OF VEGETABLE FOODSTUFFS FOR PRESERVATIONThis invention relates to a method of treating vegetable foodstuffs to preserve them, and to hermetically sealed containers of vegetable so treated.Raw vegetables are usually preserved by freezing or chilling, in which case the foodstuff is not sterile, or by canning which involves sterilization by heat and leaves the product in a more or less cooked state. These methods are all energy intensive, and freezing or canning may require high initial expenditure on equipment. The generally preferred method, freezing, not only requires initial expenditure and a great deal of energy for the preliminary treatment, but the frozen product must be transported and stored in a frozen condition. This requires a continual energy input which is expensive. In the canning of vegetables, it is necessary to add a covering liquid, usually brine, to the vegetables before processing. This represents approximately 35% of the volume and weight of the container, which adds to storage and distribution costs. The brine is of no value to the consumer of the vegetables.A number of methods of treating vegetable foodstuffs have been proposed. For example. United States patents nos. 2620277, 3959501, 4097612 and 4579743, European patent specification no. 0 006 067, French patents nos. 72.23697 and 75.14327, Belgian patent no. 545875. and U.K. patents nos. 2059248 and 2174588 all include the use of sulphur dioxide in the treatment for its anti-oxidant and 

bactercidal properties. The use of sulphur dioxide in foodstuffs is not permitted in Japan and is rigorously controlled in most other countries. There is growing public concern about possible ill effects on health arising from the consumption of foodstuffs containing sulphur dioxide, so a preservation process which did not require the inclusion of sulphur dioxide would be advantageous.As a result of continuing research, we have now made the surprising discovery that it is not necessary to use a sulphur dioxide preservative for vegetable foodstuffs and, furthermore, we have found ways of improving the flavour of the preserved product.According to the present invention, there is provided a method of treating a vegetable foodstuff to preserve it, which method comprises treating the foodstuff in an acid solution of pH 3.8 or less containing one or more non-toxic food acids or other organoleptically acceptable non-toxic acids, the treated foodstuff having a pH of no more than about 4.8, and then sealing the treated foodstuff in a

CLAIMS :
1. A method of treating a vegetable foodstuff to preserve it, which method comprises treating the foodstuff in an acid solution of pH 3.8 or less which solution contains one or more non-toxic food or other organoleptically acceptable acids, the treated foodstuff having a pH of no more than about 4.8, and then sealing the treated foodstuff in a container, the foodstuff having been sterilised by heat and having been blanched.
2. A method according to claim 1, which is effected without using any sulphur dioxide preservative.
3. A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the acid solution is a mixture of acids containing one or more of acetic, alginic, tartaric, malic, fumaric, adipic, ascorbic, citric, hydrochloric and phosphoric acid.
4. A method according to claim 3, wherein the acid solution contains tartaric acid and phosphoric acid.
5. A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the acid solution also contains salt.
6. A method according to any of claims 1 to 5 , wherein the vegetable foodstuff is blanched in the acid solution.
7. A method according to claim 6, wherein the acid solution is heated to from about 90
*
C to less than 100
Î²
C and the vegetable foodstuff is blanched therein for from 7 to 40 minutes, the pH of the solution being maintained at from 2.2 to 3.8 throughout the period. 


8. A method according to claim 4, wherein the vegetable foodstuff is raw potato and the acid solution comprises by weight 15 parts tartaric acid, 15 parts citric acid, 3 parts phosphoric acid and 20 parts salt in 100 parts water.
9. A method according to any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the vegetable foodstuff is raw potato and the potato is first blanched at a low temperature and then blanched in the acid solution at a higher temperature.
10. A method according to claim 7, wherein the vegetable foodstuff is beetroot.
11. A method according to claim 10, wherein the beetroot is first cooked by steaming, and is then treated in heated acid solution.
12. A method according to any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the treated foodstuff is hermetically sealed in a thermoplastic material container.
13. A method according to any of claims 1 to 12, wherein the container is evacuated and then flushed with an inert gas before sealing the treated foodstuff therein.
14. A hermetically sealed container having therein a vegetable foodstuff which has been treated by the method of any preceding claim.
15. A hermetically sealed container within which is a sterile blanched vegetable foodstuff selected from potatoes, carrots, beetroot, parsnips, swede turnips, cauliflowers, asparagus, artichokes, broccoli, cabbage, corn, celery, peppers, broad beans, haricot beans and butter beans; the said foodstuff having a pH 4.8 or less and having an extended shelf life, and whose flavour is substantially the same as the blanched but otherwise untreated fresh vegetable . 


16. A hermetically sealed con'ta
r
iner within which is a sterile blanched vegetable foodstuff of pH 4.8 or less having an extended shelf life, which foodstuff has been treated in an acid solution, the foodstuff and acid being selected from:
potato tartaric/citric/phosphoric acid mixture potato tartaric/citric/acetic acid mixture potato tartaric/citric/malic/orthophosphoric acid mixture
carrot malic/tartaric/phosphoric acid mixture parsnip malic/tartaric/phosphoric acid mixture swede turnip malic/tartaric/phosphoric acid mixture
cauliflower malic/tartaric acid mixture beetroot tartaric/phosphoric acid mixture
