<ABSTRACT>
Equipment and process for the preparation of immunoinsulating polymeric 
microcapsules containing cells producing hormones. Said equipment 

comprises two coaxial tubes vertically disposed of which the inner tube 
(1) is provided for the oxygen feeding and the outer tube (2) is provided 

for the feeding of a cells suspension in a polymeric material. The 
product coming out from the two tubes system is picked up in the 

underlying basin (3) containing a solution suitable to induce the 
gelification of the polymeric material. Microcapsules of diameter between 

10 and 500 µm according to the encapsulated cellular structures 
dimensions and having a ratio by volume with polymeric material and cells 

between 5:1 and 10:1 are obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
Microcapsules formed by polymeric materials containing cells producing 
hormones are known. Microcapsules of such a kind are produced for example by Darman Biotech 
(Boston) and commercialized with the name Encapcell. Their features allow the protection of the cells contained in them 
against possible rejection phenomena, a correct metabolic activity and 
the release of the hormones secreted by the cells themselves. However, the introduction of said microcapsules in the human body implies 
some problems among which the following ones can be pointed out: 
1) The microcapsules introduced in the human body are wrapped up by a 
connective reactive tissue preventing whether the metabolic supply to the 
cells or the emission of the hormones produced by them; 2) The microcapsules, injected in a cavity such as peritoneum, tend to 
deposit in the cavity bottom concentrating in a restricted zone and 
determining a lively reaction of connective kind wrapping them up. These problems could be solved making suitable vascular protheses 
enclosing in their walls, of semipermeable kind, the microcapsules. These 
protheses, planted in the recipient in order to form some arterial-venous 
fistulas, would allow the microcapsules exposition to the hematic flux 
carrying out in this way a correct metabolism of the cells contained in 
the microcapsules and the release in circle of hormones secreted by the 
cells themselves. However, this solution turns out to be impossible with the use of 
microcapsules obtainable with the prior art as the protheses would result  
 
too voluminous in order to be applied. In fact the volume of the polymeric material needed to encapsulate the 
cells turns out to be from 60 to 100 times the volume of the cells 
themselves and this makes impossible the realization of vascular 
protheses of acceptable dimensions. Possible protheses made with the 
microcapsules of the prior art would have a minumum length of 600 mm and 
a minimum diameter of 12 mm. Now it has been surprisingly found that it is possible to prepare 
immunoinsulating microcapsules containing cells producing hormones using 
a polymeric material volume between 5 and 10 times the volume of the 
cells themselves. This result has been possible thanks to the equipment and process of the 
present invention. The equipment comprises a system of two coaxial tubes vertically disposed 
and an underlying basin. The inner tube is connected to a system for the oxygen feeding and shows 
the lower end retracted with respect to the same end of the outer
