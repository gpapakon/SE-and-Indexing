<ABSTRACT>
In a clarifier, control of liquid flow in flow 
channels is done by arcuate flow control members so as 

to minimize flow rate variations from one channel to 
another channel. Such control is provided while: (1) 

reducing the weight of lamina (61) through the use of 
light-weight sheets (119); (2) allowing lamina 

settling angles to be varied by connecting the lamina 
to an adjustment mechanism (63); (3) permitting 

individual lamina (61) to be removed from rails 
separately from all of the other lamina; (4) 

avoiding sagging of individual lamina positioned at a 
selected settling angle by using a compression column 

(116); and (5) allowing the flow to be controlled in 
a non-linear manner relative to the settling angle by 

using the arcuate flow control members (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for promoting settling of
solids from waste water, and more particularly to a deck and
lamina for a settler in which the lamina are light weight and
easily removable from the settler, and wherein the lamina may
have the angle thereof varied relative to the surface of the
waste water while making preset changes to the area of outlets
defined by the deck, where the outlets are from flow channels
formed by two adjacent lamina.Clarifiers are used to remove certain materials and particles
from liquid. These materials are generally suspended in the
liquid and can be removed under the force of gravity when the
flow of the liquid is substantially reduced, as when there is a
very low rate of flow, such as in a quiescent zone (or flow
channel) in the clarifier. Since these materials are generally
solid and are said to "settle" out of the liquid, they are referred
to as "settleable solids". Such settleable solids may 
include naturally occurring materials (e.g., clay, silt, sand
and dirt), chemical precipitants and biological solids. The
word "solids" as used herein to describe the present invention
refers to such settleable solids.Clarifiers are used, for example, in water and waste water
treatment plants. In water treatment, the water drawn from a
water supply has various non-settleable colloidal solids
therein. When mixed with chemicals, the colloidal solids and
chemicals agglomerate to form settleable solids. In waste water
treatment, the solids include organic solids, among other
wastes. Water and waste water are treated in clarifiers to
remove such solids, thereby making the water clear and suitable
for use, reuse, or for further treatment, such as tertiary
treatment. The word "liquid" as used herein to describe the
present invention refers to water and waste water.An object of water and waste water clarifiers is to create a
low flow rate, such as in flow channels. Low flow rates promote
maximum settlement of the settleable solids to the bottom
of the clarifiers. Clarifiers typically include a large detention
basin where the settlement of the solids occurs. Tubes or
flat plates mounted at fixed angles relative to the surface of
the liquid have been used to form multiple thin liquid flow
channels within the detention basin in an attempt to promote
settling of solids in less time using less space. Such plates
have been constructed out of relatively heavy, single sheets of
metal or plastic that are supported on their sides and connected
to the side walls of self-contained
