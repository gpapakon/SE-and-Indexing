<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile apparatus is provided which having a 
memory of small capacity and a low speed printer. When 

printing of received data is late owing to a print 
speed lower than a reception rate, a time period 

required for printing is calculated and some operations 
are executed according to the calculated time period. 

When the calculated time period is short for printing a 
flow control according to the recommendation CCITT T39 

is conducted, while when it is longer the data amount 
corresponding to the time period is calculated and resend 

of the number of frames corresponding to the 
calculated data amount is requested to a sending 

station. Thereby, received data is printed with 
adequate printing time period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a small image 
communication apparatus which can request error 
retransmission (i.e., which has an error correction 
function, or, an ECM function). A conventional facsimile apparatus having an error 
retransmission request function (ECM reception) 
comprises a large-capacity storage means and a high-speed 
reproducing (printing) means. Such a facsimile apparatus uses a memory properly 
for reception and printing of image signals as needed. With this arrangement, while image signals are 
being written in the memory for reception, a previous 
page (or previous block) received in advance is 
printed. Since the storage capacity of the storage means is 
large, even if there is an error at the beginning of a 
page, the error portion is retransmitted. The error 
portion is then reproduced during reception of the next 
page, or at the end of communication. Even when the memory becomes full, one page (one 
block) or more can be reproduced and printed at a high 
speed, while flow control is performed, thereby setting  
 
reception of the next page (block) within a recommended 
predetermined time. Furthermore, when printing is not completed within 
a time upon reception of an elongated original or the 
like, the latest page (block) is requested to be 
retransmitted in units of pages (blocks), and a 
previous page is printed during retransmission of this 
page (block). In a small facsimile apparatus such as a portable 
one, the ECM function is necessary for performing 
normal communication through the connection with a 
portable telephone or the like. A conventional facsimile apparatus having the 
large-capacity storage means and the high-speed 
reproducing means results in high cost. At the same 
time, this results in a larger and complex apparatus 
using a high energy. For this reason, in order to arrange a small, 
light weight, and energy-saving facsimile apparatus 
having the ECM function at low cost, the ECM reception 
must be performed using a storage means with a minimum 
capacity and a low-speed reproducing means. In addition, a communication time must be 
minimized to reduce the load of a user. It is an object of the present invention to  
 
improve a communication apparatus. It is another object of the present invention to 
improve a facsimile apparatus. It is still another object of the present 
invention to realize smooth ECM reception using a 
storage means with a minimum capacity and a low-speed 
reproducing means. Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the arrangement 
of

<CLAIMS>
An image communication apparatus having a 
function of requesting a sending station to re-send 

data for ECM communication, comprising means for 
reproducing received data and memory means for storing 

communication information and print data, wherein said 
apparatus has a function of ECM reception, and when it 

is decided in ECM reception that the received data 
cannot be reproduced owing to a shortage of time period 

even when a flow control is executed, said apparatus 
sends to the sending station a signal PPR in reply to a 

signal PPS-Q from the sending station so as to request 
the sending station to re-send, while reproducing the 

received image data. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the 
decision that image data cannot be reproduced owing to a 

shortage of time period even when a flow control is 
executed, is effected on the basis of a memory size for 

data not printed in view of the number of frames or a 
frame size of the data not printed. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the 
decision that image data cannot be rep
roduced owing to a 
shortage of time period even when a flow control is 

executed, is effected by calculating a time period 
required for decoding and printing the data not 

 
reproduced on the basis of a decoding time period, the 

number of lines not printed or a printing time for one 
line. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the 
decision that image data cannot be reproduced owing to a 

shortage of time period even when a flow control is 
executed, is effected by calculating a capacity of a 

free area of the memory means. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the 
request of re-sending is effected by requesting the 

sending station to re-send the sum of the number of 
received error frames and a predetermined number of 

frames, or to re-send some frames calculating a time 
period required for a flow control after re-sending 

when frames to be re-sent requested is set. 
An apparatus according to any of Claims 2 to 
5, wherein frames to be re-sent requested are set in 

such a manner that the end portion of received blocks 
corresponsing to the calculated number of frames may be 

re-sent. 
An apparatus according to any of Claims 2 to 
5, wherein frames to be re-sent requested corresponding 

to the calculated number of frames are set after the 
 

frames not printed. 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein re-sent 
frames other than frames re-sent owing to 

reception error are only checked without overwriting 
correct frames stored in the memory means. 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein all 
of re-sent frames are written in the memory means and 

are checked.
