<ABSTRACT>
A graph display apparatus according to this 
invention has the following arrangement. A dynamic 

graph key in a key input unit (11) is operated, and a 
functional formula subjected to graph calculation and a 

change range and a change pitch of a coefficient value 
present in the functional formula input using 

numeric Â· ysymbol keys (13) are stored in a formula 
register (23a) in a RAM (23). When an execution key 

(EXE) is operated in a state wherein a coefficient 
change speed is stored in an SP register (23c), the 

coefficient value of the functional formula is 
sequentially replaced within the change range at the 

change pitch. Graphic data of the functional formula 
and corresponding graph formulas with the changes in 

coefficients are sequentially stored in a plurality of 
video memory areas (24a, 24b,...) in a VRAM (24), and 

graphs and corresponding graph formulas for the changes 
in coefficients are sequentially read out in accordance 

with the coefficient change speed to be sequentially 
switched and displayed on a display unit (12). When 

the coefficient present in the formula is changed as a 

parameter, the graphs corresponding to the formulas are 
sequentially displayed, thus easily grasping the graph 

change state with the change in coefficient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a graph display
apparatus
which can display the graphs of a functional
formula depending on coefficients of the
functional formula.Electronic calculators which have a
functional calculation function and also have a graph
display function for calculating and displaying the
graph of an input functional formula have been
commercially available.More specifically, a functional formula to be
displayed is input in advance, and X-coordinate values
in units of display dots on a dot-matrix display
apparatus are also substituted in the input functional
formula by inputting X- and Y-coordinate ranges (Xmin,
Xmax) and (Ymin, Ymax) of the functional formula. With
this operation, calculated Y-coordinate values are
sequentially written on a VRAM (video memory), thus
displaying the graph of the functional formula. Such a
graph display technique is described in, e.g., US
4,794,553, US 4,794,554, and the like. Therefore, in
the conventional graph display apparatus, both a
functional formula to be displayed and X- and 
Y-coordinate ranges must be input with keys, resulting
in very cumbersome operations. T. W. Beers et al., "HP 48SX Interfaces and Applications", Hewlett-Packard Journal,
42 (1991) June, No. 3, pages 13 to 21 discloses a scientific expandable calculator
which provides support for multiple applications with customised user interfaces.
The calculator has an equation-writer and interactive plotting built in.DE 37 35 167 A1 discloses an electronic calculator capable of graphically displaying
functions. The display region may be shifted in order to reveal portions of the graph
not currently visible to the user.It is the object of the invention to provide an improved graph display apparatus which
allows a user to investigate the effect of changes in a coefficient value in the form of
a graph.This object is solved by the invention as claimed in independent claim 1.Preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent claims. In order to achieve the above object, according to
the present invention, a graph display apparatus
comprises: formula storage means for storing formula
data consisting of at least coefficient data and
variable data; coefficient range storage means for

graph display means for changing a coefficient for the
formula data stored in the formula storage means
within the change range data stored in the coefficient
range storage means to display a graph.With this arrangement, according to the present
invention, the
