An applicator for applying heat-fusible substances, in particular
depilatory wax, said applicator comprising a housing (1) forming

grasping means, a reservoir (2) for the substance to be applied,
which reservoir is thermally connected to heater means (4), and a

head (11) constituted by at least one applicator roller (15) disposed
in the vicinity of an outlet orifice of the reservoir (2), said

roller including a core (16) surrounded by an applicator layer (18)
of a plastics material, said applicator being characterized in that:


the reservoir (2) is made of a material that is a good
conductor of heat, and is preferably made of aluminium;
said core (16) is made of a material that is a good conductor
of heat; and
said core (16) is solid, and both of its ends are provided with
thermal bridges providing heat conduction between the roller (15) and

the reservoir (2).
An applicator according to claim 1, characterized in that the
thermal bridges are constituted by stub axles (17).
An applicator according to claim 2, characterized in that said
stub axles (17) are shaped from the mass proper of the core (16), and

they form the pins on which the roller (15) rotates.
An applicator according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the applicator layer (18) has a given thickness 
e
 and the
core (16) has a radius R, the ratio e/R lying in the range 0.3 to

0.5, and preferably substantially equal to 0.4.
An applicator according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the applicator roller (15) is removably mounted on the

reservoir (2).
An applicator according to claim 5, characterized in that the top
portion of the reservoir (2) is provided with two slots (20) open at

their top ends, disposed facing each other on the faces of the
housing (1), and on the bottoms of which respective ones of the stub 

axles (17) rest, each slot (20) being associated with locking means
for locking the stub axles (17) in position, said means being

suitable for moving out of the way so to make the roller (15)
removable.
An applicator according to claim 6, characterized in that each
locking means is constituted by a U-shaped clip (21) mounted in fixed

manner against each slot (20) and in the same direction, each clip
(21) having side arms forming a neck (22) between them so as to lock

the stub axles (17) at the bottom of each slot (20), the side arms
further being resilient enough to be deformed and to enable the stub

axles (17) to pass through the necks (22).
An applicator according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that the
slots (20) are provided in a separate head (11) forming the top

portion of the reservoir (2) and defining the outlet orifice of the
reservoir (2).
An applicator according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the applicator roller (15) is mounted on the housing (1) to

be displaceable between a working position in the outlet orifice
(11b) of the reservoir (2), and a disengagement position in which

said orifice is unobstructed to enable said reservoir (2) to be
filled.
An applicator according to claim 9, characterized in that the
applicator roller (15) is secured to a slider (50) mounted to be

displaceable by sliding longitudinally on the housing (1), and
preferably on the top portion of the reservoir (2).
An applicator according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the applicator roller (15) is provided with

grasping latches (40) on both of its ends, enabling it to be
removable. 
An applicator according to claim 11, characterized in that the
grasping latches (40) are constituted by circular lips forming

surplus thicknesses on the ends of the roller (15).
An applicator according to claim 12, characterized in that the
circular lips are provided in the thickness 
e
 of the applicator layer
(18).
