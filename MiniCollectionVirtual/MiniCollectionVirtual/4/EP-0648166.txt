<ABSTRACT>
Control signals for electric consumers in vehicle doors and AF signals for loudspeakers in vehicle doors are transmitted to a door module (20, 30) by a controller (1) located away from the door over a common data line (42, 43). For that purpose, the binary coded control signals are modulated in the controller (1) on a carrier signal and the AF audio signal is equally modulated on the same carrier signal. The signals are demodulated and separated according to their frequency in the door module (20, 30). The AF signals are amplified and supplied to a loudspeaker (4, 5). The control signals are evaluated by a micro-controller (24, 34) and control adjusting elements (6, 7) provided in the door via switching stages (23, 33). It is also possible to transmit data in the reverse direction from the door module (20, 30) to the controller (1).
