<ABSTRACT>
A pattern recognition apparatus includes a
plurality of net structure dictionaries, reconstruction

section, a first storage section, and a pattern matching
section. Each of the net structure dictionaries has a

net structure formed by connecting, through a node, a
parent arc representing a common portion of a plurality

of standard patterns as recognition units of a
recognition target to a child arc representing a

remaining portion. The reconstruction section extracts
a common structure from the net structure dictionaries

and reconstructs them to generate a reconstructed
dictionary. The first storage section stores original

dictionary connecting information representing the
relationship between the extracted common structure and

the net structure dictionaries.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pattern
recognition apparatus which performs pattern matching
between an input pattern as a recognition target and
standard patterns described in a plurality of net
structure dictionaries using beam search, thereby
obtaining a recognition candidate.Conventionally, when the number of objects to
be recognized is very large in voice recognition or the
like, pattern matching using beam search is used with
which pattern recognition using a small-capacity RAM
(Random Access Memory) and a small quantity of
calculation is enabled, as disclosed in H. Sakoe et al.,
"A High Speed DP-Matching Algorithm Based on
Synchronization, Beam Search and Vector Quantization",
THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF COMMUNICATION
ENGINEERS, Vol. J71-D, No. 9, pp. 1650 - 1659, September
1988 (reference 1).Beam search is a technique of removing
matching paths that do not affect the recognition result
using a net structure dictionary. To avoid influence on
the recognition result, many paths must be left at the
initial stage, as pointed out in Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open No. 10-153999 (reference 2). However, when
the standard patterns of the recognition target are
described in the net structure dictionary, the number of
matching paths to be searched is small by itself, and
the number of paths to be left can also be relatively
small. Hence, when a recognition apparatus is formed
using a net structure dictionary, the capacity of a
storage means for storing paths can be small.For pattern recognition, the recognition rate
becomes high when the number of recognition targets is
small. For this reason, preferably, the use conditions
are finely sorted, and a small number of targets are
recognized in units of finely sorted conditions. On the
other hand, in some cases, recognition targets under
different use conditions, e.g., place names in each
administrative district and nationwide place names may
be simultaneously recognized. If it is known that only
a place name in a specific administrative district is to
be recognized, a net structure dictionary related to
this specific administrative district is used as a
recognition target, thereby improving the recognition
rate. If a nationwide place name is to be recognized,
the place name dictionary for each administrative
district is simultaneously used together as a
recognition target.In this case, the dictionary for the
nationwide place names is unnecessary. Unlike a case 
wherein nationwide and administrative district
dictionaries are independently prepared, the
