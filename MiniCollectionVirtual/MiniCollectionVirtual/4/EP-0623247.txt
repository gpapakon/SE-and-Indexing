<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the fabrication of dielectric material suitable for dielectric antennas such as Luneburg-type lens antennas and to an according antenna system. It is an object of the present invention to produce dielectric material with a low weight and the possibility of adjusting a dielectric constant quite easily. According to the invention dielectric pieces, which collectively form the dielectric material, have a hollow shape. By the variation of the thickness, the effective dielectric constant can be varied. The antenna system according to the invention includes a virtuel lens antenna with extended reflecting means. The material produced according to this invention can preferably be used for the production of Luneburg-type lenses.

<DESCRIPTION>
 _.i§i___--_li_.__3_i_L_.li_.i_.Ϊ2I__lD_-_.DD§_.The present invention relates to a production method of dielectric material suitable for dielectric antennas such as Luneburg-type lens antennas and to an according antenna.Dielectric antennas are well known, e . g from US 4 531 129. In this patent the use of Luneburg antennas and appropriate feed's are described for the use a satellite broadcasting receiver system to receive microwave signals. Such antennas can also be used as part of a transmitter system.Several combinations of di electrical antennas with different kinds of feeders are descr bed in the European patent applica¬ tion 91400179.9.Several methods for the fabrication of Luneburg-type lenses have been described in the European patent applications 90403051.7 and 91401444.4.Vi rtual dielectric antennas, e.g. Luneburg-t pe antennas are known from the article "Vi rtual Source Luneburg Lenses"; G. D. PI. Peeler et al., IRE TRANSACTIONS - ANTENNAS AND PROPAGA¬ TION, July 1954. In this article there are also vi rtual source lenses described, in which reflecting means, realized as one or more reflectors, are arranged.D electric lenses can be produced by dielectric material e.g. with voids, which are created in solid plas c material by he ispherical indentations in plastic sheets which are verti¬ cally stacked and fixed together. Such a method is known from the article "Artif cial dielectrics uti lizing cyl ndrical and spherical voids"; Proceedings of the IRE, Vol. 44, pp 171 - 174, 1956. 

 It is an object of the present invention to provide a new method for the fabrication of dielectric antennas with re¬ duced production costs.This can be realised by the method according to claim 1.Dielectric antennas can be e.g. Luneburg-type lens antennas homogenous-type lens antennas, Eaton-Lippmann lens antennas, or thelike. The said antennas may be shaped e.g. spherical, hemispherical, quarter sphere, cylindrical or the like.The present invention is based on the following principle.A dielectric material composed of individual pieces will appear essentially homogeneous (contin ous) to signals whose frequency is such that their wavelength is greater than, the dimension of the pieces. This means, that at microwave fre¬ quencies of about 10 Ghz, normally used for direct broadcast¬ ing from a satellite (wavelength is in the range of about 2.5 cm), pieces of several mi Iimeters in di ens on may be used to fabricate the dielectric material.By changing their packing density by adjustment cf the piece shape the dielectric
