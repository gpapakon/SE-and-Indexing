<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a composite article in which a ceramic component and a metal component are bonded to one another by means of internal soldering. The internal soldering is effected by means of soldering composition in a recess (2) within a component (1) of the one material in which there is arranged a component (3), which is shaped so as to fit accurately, of the other material. The recess (2) is surrounded on at least one end-face opening by a chamfer (5) whose angle  phi  is less than 35 DEG C, while the wetting angle (contact angle) ss between the soldering composition and the plane of the component surface in which the recess is located is less than 40 DEG C.

A composite body in which a ceramic component is 
bonded to a metal component by internal soldering wherein 

the internal soldering is effected with soldering composition 
in a recess within a component of the one material 

in which there is arranged a component of the other 
material which is shaped to fit accurately, the recess 

is, at at least one end-face opening, surrounded by a 
chamfer having an angle smaller than 35°, preferably 

smaller than 20°, and the wetting angle β between the 
soldering composition and the plane of the component 

surface in which the recess is located is smaller than 
40°, preferably smaller than 20°.

containing at least 80 % by weight, preferably at least 

94 % by weight, of Al
2
O
3
, or, as nonoxidic ceramic, SiC, 
SiSiC, Si
3
N
4
 or AlN. 
A composite body as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein a ceramic component is provided with a recess, 

metallization being applied in the region of the contact 
surface of the recess and, if desired, also on the 

chamfer. 
A composite body as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the metallization layer has applied to it an additional 

nickel coating which possesses a thickness in the range 
from 0.5 to 5 µm. 
A composite body as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 4, wherein the soldering composition comprises a 

copper/silver alloy having a copper content in the range 
from 10 to 80 % by weight, preferably from 15 to 60 % by 

weight, based on the total weight of silver and copper, 
where one or more elements such as Zn, Sn, Cd, Pd, Mn, 

Ni, Au, Si, In, Pt, Ti or Hf can be additionally present 
in the soldering composition. 
A process for producing a composite body as 
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, in which an  

 
accurately fitting metal component coated with soldering 

composition is arranged inside a recess in a ceramic 
component and is subsequently thermally treated, which 

comprises carrying out the thermal treatment at temperatures 
in the range from 600 to 1300°C, preferably from 

750 to 850°C, in vacuo or under a protective gas atmosphere. 
The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the 
application of the solder composition of copper and 

silver to the component arranged in the recess is carried 
out by the electrolytic method. 
The process as claimed in claim 6 or 7, wherein 
the layer of solder which is arranged on the component 

arranged in the recess is applied in a thickness of less 
than 100 µm, preferably less than 50 µm, particularly 

preferably less than 25 µm. 
Use of a composite body as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 5 as a duct, rectifier housing, seal, sliding 

element, bearing element, piezoelectric element, pump 
piston, thyristor housing, surge arresters, vacuum 

chamber, switching tube, ignition element, diode, rock 
top or spacer block for components subjected to chemical, 

mechanical and/or thermal stresses.
