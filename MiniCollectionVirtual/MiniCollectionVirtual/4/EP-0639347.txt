<ABSTRACT>
A digital phase shifter capable of shifting the phases of data row by steps shorter than the sampling period even though the 
sampling signal the phase of which is fixed or a clock signal is used. This phase shifter comprises : a memory for storing consecutively 

time series data sampled at given periods in addresses corresponding to the sampling times ; reading means for reading 
from this memory consecutively the data at sampling times earlier than the current sampling time by a desired period of time in 

synchronism with the sampling of the time series data ; a register for holding several consecutive pieces of data including the latest 
one with respect to those read from the memory ; and means for generating interpolated data in desired divided positions at 

the sampling intervals of a plurality of pieces of data held in this register by adding weights to the plural pieces of data held in it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital
phase shifting apparatus. To put it in more detail, the
present invention relates to a digital phase shifting
apparatus which is capable of shifting the phase of
digital data by a fine step shorter than the sampling
period of an A/D converter. The digital phase shifting
apparatus is implemented as delay circuits and useful
typically for an ultrasonic diagnosing apparatus.An example of the conventional digital phase
shifting apparatus which is capable of shifting the
phase of digital data by a fine step shorter than the
sampling period of an A/D converter is disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 63-222745. A block
diagram showing the configuration of an ultrasonic
diagnosing apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open
No. 63-222745 is shown in Fig. 7.In this ultrasonic diagnosing apparatus 51, a
signal received from a probe 2 undergoes phase
adjustment for all channels by a number of delay 
circuits (or phase shifting circuits): a first-channel
delay circuit 81 to an nth-channel delay circuit 8n.
The outputs of the delay circuits are then summed up by
an adder 5. The adder 5 carries out a beam forming
process for generating a sound-ray reception signal.
Based on all the sound-ray reception signals, a scan
converter 6 produces pictures to be displayed on a
display apparatus 7.A detailed block diagram of the first-channel
delay circuit 81 is shown in Fig. 8. The delay circuits
of the other channels each have entirely the same
configuration. A signal received by the first-channel
delay circuit 81 is supplied to an A/D converter 82. A
clock signal having a predetermined period ΔT is fed to
a sampling signal delay means 83. A synchronization
signal also having the predetermined period ΔT is
supplied to a synchronization means 84. The
synchronization means 83 delays the clock signal by a
time rl shorter than the period ΔT, producing a sampling
signal output to the A/D converter 82.The A/D converter 82 samples the signal
received by the first-channel delay circuit 81 at
sampling intervals equal to ΔT by using the sampling
signal, converting the received signal into digital
data. The signal received by the first-channel delay 
circuit 81 is denoted by notations D and D' in Figs. 9
and 10 respectively. Digital data obtained by using
sampling signals with delay times different from each
other is, on the other hand, denoted by symbols  and ○
in Figs. 9 and 10 respectively. For a sampling interval
ΔT of 100 ns, the symbols  and ○ denote sampled
digital data for
