<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to silver-metal 
oxide materials that are suitable for use as electrical 
contacts. Silver-metal oxide materials are used as contacts in 
a variety of electrical devices, such as relays, because 
of their high conductivity and resistance to welding that 
can occur between contacts. The silver provides high 
conductivity. The metal oxide provides resistance to 
welding. Currently, the contact material of choice is 
silver-cadmium oxide because it has the desired 
conductivity and weld resistance and is easy to make. 
Silver-cadmium oxide contact materials typically contain 
about 7 weight percent (wt%) to about 13 wt% oxide. Recently, concerns about the toxicity of airborne 
cadmium and cadmium oxide particles have led some 
jurisdictions to propose regulations to lower the amount 
of such particles permitted in manufacturing 
environments. Complying with these regulations will 
require process changes that will make silver-cadmium 
oxide materials too expensive for use in many commercial 
applications. As a result, silver-cadmium oxide is 
likely to be phased out as a contact material. If that 
happens, silver-tin oxide is a logical successor. 
Silver-tin oxide does not present the same toxicity 
concerns as silver-cadmium oxide and can have superior 
contact properties. For some applications, silver-tin  
 
oxide materials with 7 wt% to 10 wt% oxide are suitable. 
Many applications, however, require tin oxide contents of 
at least about 10 wt% to provide adequate weld 
resistance. Several methods for making silver-tin oxide contact 
materials are available. The most straightforward method 
is to oxidize tin in a silver-tin alloy. When exposed to 
oxidizing conditions, however, the silver-tin alloy forms 
an undesirable, tenacious, protective oxide scale that 
inhibits internal oxidation. As a result, this method 
cannot make materials with more than about 8 wt% tin 
oxide. Efforts to overcome this limitation by oxidizing 
silver-tin alloys in high pressure, pure oxygen 
atmospheres have been unsuccessful. US-A-4 472 211 discloses a method of internally 
oxidizing a silver-tin alloy by first exposing the alloy 
to a vacuum, or a non-oxidizing or reducing atmosphere, 
such as a hydrogen or argon atmosphere, at an elevated 
temperature to decrease the concentration of the solute 
metals or oxides at the surface of the alloy by partial 
sublimation, reduction, or extraction. The alloy is then 
internally oxidized in an oxygen atmosphere at an 
elevated temperature.
