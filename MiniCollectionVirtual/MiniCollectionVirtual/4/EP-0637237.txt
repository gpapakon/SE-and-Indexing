<ABSTRACT>
Method and composition useful for treating a patient having a disease characterized by an abnormal level of one or more components, the activity of which is regulated or affected by activity of one or more inorganic-ion receptor. Novel compounds useful in these methods and compositions are also provided. The method includes administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a molecule active at one or more inorganic-ion receptors as an agent or antagonist. Preferably, the molecule is able to act as either a selective agonist or antagonist at a Ca

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the design, development,
composition and use of novel calcimimetic molecules able to
act in a manner analogous to extracellular calcium ions on
cells, to calcilytic molecules which block the activity of
extracellular calcium ions on cells, and to methods for
their use and identification.It also relates to a novel superfamily of inorganic-ion
receptors which includes, among others, calcium receptors,
nucleic acids encoding such receptors, cells, tissues and
animals containing such nucleic acids, antibodies to
receptors, assays utilizing receptors, and methods relating
to all of the foregoing.The following description provides a summary of
information relevant to the present invention. It is not an
admission that any of the information provided herein is
prior art to the presently claimed invention, nor that any
of the publications specifically or implicitly referenced 
are prior art to that invention.Certain cells in the body respond not only to
chemical signals, but also to ions such as extracellular
calcium ions (Ca2+). Changes in the concentration of
extracellular Ca2+ (referred to herein as "[Ca2+]")
alter the functional responses of these cells. One such
specialized cell is the parathyroid cell which secretes
parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is the principal endocrine
factor regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in the blood and
extracellular fluids.PTH, by acting on bone and kidney cells, increases
the level of Ca2+ in the blood. This increase in [Ca2+]
then acts as a negative feedback signal,depressing PTH
secretion. The reciprocal relationship between [Ca2+] and
PTH secretion forms the essential mechanism maintaining
bodily Ca2+ homeostasis.Extracellular Ca2+ acts directly on the parathy
roid cell to regulate PTH secretion. The existence of a
parathyroid cell surface protein which detects changes in
[Ca2+] has been suggested. This protein acts as a
receptor for extracellular Ca2+ ("the Ca2+ receptor"),
and is suggested to detect changes in [Ca2+] and to
initiate a functional cellular response, PTH secretion. For
example, the role of Ca2+ receptors and extracellular
Ca2+ in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ and cell
function is reviewed in Nemeth et al., 11 Cell Calcium 319,
1990; the role of Ca2+ receptors in parafollicular and
parathyroid cells is discussed in Nemeth, 11 Cell Calcium
323, 1990; and the role of Ca2+ receptors on bone
osteoclasts is discussed by Zaidi, 10 Bioscience Reports
493, 1990. Other cells in the body, specifically the
osteoclast in bone, the
