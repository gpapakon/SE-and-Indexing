<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device to allow access of a medical sensor probe (3) to a selected location within a patient's body. A disposable elongated tubular sheath (2) is releasably attached at its closed distal end (10) to the wall of a blood vessel (1) during surgery. The sheath leads out of the patient's body and provides an access path through which a sensor probe, such as an ultrasound probe (3), can be introduced in order to allow monitoring of blood flow within the vessel. The probe can be easily removed and replaced without contamination. When monitoring is complete, the releasable attachment means (6, 7) are operated and the sheath can be pulled out of the patient's body without further surgery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The use of implantable probes or sensors to monitor the 
operation of organs within the human body has become considerably 
more common in recent years and, in particular, the continuous 
post-operative measurement of blood flow in vessels is frequently 
required in order to evaluate the results of medical procedures. 
A common and convenient type of probe for this purpose is of 
ultrasound Doppler form, such a probe being used as a blood flow 
velocity sensor. In the case of heart operations the ability to 
monitor post-operatively cardiac performance is required and this 
can be done by measuring the blood volume flow through the 
ascending aorta. The probe is located adjacent to the aorta 
during cardiac surgery and can be connected to monitoring 
equipment in the operating theatre. Subsequent to the operation 
the connecting leads can be unplugged and the patient moved to, 
say, an intensive care unit where similar monitoring equipment is 
available. The probe can then be connected again for continued 
monitoring over the required period of investigation. To achieve accurate flow velocity measurements the Doppler 
probe must be attached firmly to the vessel under investigation. 
This is to ensure correct orientation of the probe and to ensure 
that the probe is not free to move relative to the wall of the 
vessel. However, in order to avoid a further operation to remove 
the probe from the vessel the probe must be extractable from 
outside the body of the patient without causing damage to the 
vessel or to the surrounding tissue. Known methods proposed for 
attaching the probe include suturing it to the vessel, or 
embedding a part of the probe directly in the vessel wall. The 
non-surgical removal is subsequently achieved by pulling the 
leads connected to the probe in order to withdraw it from the 
vessel and from the patient's body. Such removal can clearly be 
traumatic to the vessel and, because the probe is likely to 
present an irregular surface, damage can also be caused to other 
internal organs as it is withdrawn.  
 An implantable Doppler probe which is removable after use 
through a small opening in the patient's chest is described in 
WO-90/02519. The probe can be attached adjacent to the vessel or 
body under investigation by means of a suturing release feature. The probe used for such medical purpose is naturally required 
to be completely sterile and this presents a number of problems, 
with no guarantee of complete sterility unless autoclaving is 
used. Common practice is to discard

<CLAIMS>
A device to allow access of a medical sensor probe (3) to a blood vessel within a 
patient's body comprising an elongated tubular sheath (2) having a first portion and a 

second portion, the two portions to be positioned respectively inside and outside the 
patient's body, the sheath being closed to the exterior except for at least one opening in the 

second portion to allow access and removal of the medical sensor probe therethrough 
whilst said sheath remains indwelling within the patient's body, and the sheath having 

releasable attachment means (6,7) for securing the sheath to the wall of said blood vessel. 
A device according to Claim 1 wherein the first portion of the sheath has an internal 
form adapted to accommodate a probe of predetermined shape in a prescribed orientation 

in the sheath. 
A device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the first portion of the sheath has 
a distal end portion provided with a partially concave external surface (12) to fit against a 

blood vessel wall (1). 
A device according to any preceding claim wherein the releasable attachment 
means (6,7) is adapted to be operable from outside the patient's body. 
A device according to Claim 4 wherein the releasable attachment means comprises 
fixing means securable to the selected location, and a tractable element (6) co-operable 

with the fixing means, the tractable element being guidable in use by guide means 
associated with the sheath (2). 
A device according to Claim 5 wherein the fixing means comprises one or more 
sutures (7), the guide means is a bore (8) within the wall of the sheath and the tractable 

element is a wire (6).
