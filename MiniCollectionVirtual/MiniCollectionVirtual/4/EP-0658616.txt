<ABSTRACT>
Process for recovering and moving highly viscous 
petroleum products, by the use of aqueous dispersions 

in the presence of sulphonate dispersers prepared: 

a) by increasing the molecular weight of steam 
cracking fuel oil by its oligomerization in the 

presence of a catalyst selected from BF₃ and 
complexes thereof with strong acids; 
b) sulphonating the compound obtained from step (a) 
by reaction with a sulphonating agent, preferably 

SO₃; 
c) neutralizing the sulphonate obtained from step (b) 
by treatment with hydroxides selected from the 

hydroxides of alkaline or earth alkaline metals or 
ammonium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
moving highly viscous petroleum residues.Moving through pipes highly viscous petroleum
products or residues, particularly those with an API
grade of less than 15, is difficult owing to their high
viscosity and therefore low mobility.A method for improving the movement and recovery
of these highly viscous products consists in adding
hydrocarbons or lighter crude products thereto. This
mixing diminishes the viscosity of the system and
consequently increases the mobility, but has the
disadvantage of requiring considerable investments and
is therefore very costly. In addition light fractions
or crude products are not often available.Another method for improving the fluidity of
highly viscous products in pipes, consists in installing
heating elements at frequent intervals along the 
pipe; in this way the crude or petroleum product thus
heated has a lower viscosity and is therefore easier to
transport. These heating elements can be operated using
part of the transported product as fuel. This technique
can give a loss of 15-20% of the transported product.Another method for moving heavy petroleum products
or residues consists in pumping them through the pipe
in the form of more or less fluid aqueous emulsions.
These emulsions are of the oil in water type and are
therefore much more fluid to move than the crude
product.The oil in water emulsions, prepared by adding
water and emulsifying agent under stirring to the oil
to be moved, are then pumped into the pipe.The emulsifying agent must produce a stable and
fluid oil in water emulsion with a high percentage of
oil.To ensure that the process is advantageous, the
emulsifying agent must not be expensive and must give
stable emulsions during the pumping period.The emulsifying agents proposed so far do not
completely satisfy the above requisites.For example, US-A-4.246.920, US-A-4.285.356,
US-A-4.265.264, and US-A-4.249.554 describe emulsions
having only a 50% content of oil in water; under these 
conditions this means that half of the volume of the
pipe is not available for the transport of petroleum.On the other hand Canadian patents 1.108.205,
1.113.529 and 1.117.568 and also US-A-4.246.919 describe
quite low reductions in viscosity, in spite of
the relatively low proportion of oil.US-A-4.770.199 discloses emulsifying agents
consisting of complex mixtures of non-ionic alkoxylate
surface-active agents with ethoxylate-propoxylate
carboxylates. The non-ionic surface-active agent of the
above mixture is obviously
