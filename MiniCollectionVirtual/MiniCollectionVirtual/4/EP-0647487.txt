<ABSTRACT>
A machine comprising a tool-holder head (12) carrying 
a plurality of rollers (22) each having a curling groove 

(23), the rollers having their axes approximately coplanar 
and cutting the axis of rotation (13) of the tool-holder 

head at the same point. The arrangement of rollers makes 
it possible to form a curl of small diameter at the end of 

a cylindrical element such as a can body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a machine for forming a curl 
at the end of a metal cylindrical element, for example a 
can body. In particular the machine enables a curl of 
small size to be formed on such a cylindrical element, 
even if the latter is made from thin sheet steel which is 
typically difficult to work, such as for example "double 
reduced" steel. In order to form a curl at the end of a metal can 
body, it is known to use a tool comprising an annular 
shaping groove presenting the appropriate curling radii. 
With this technique, the force necessary to form the 
groove is considerable and is all the greater the smaller 
the curl is. This force, which has to be able to 
be supported axially by the can body does not therefore 
allow a curl of any desired diameter to be realised on a 
can body of given thickness. The invention concerns a new curling technique 
allowing the force necessary for realising the curl to be 
reduced very considerably. It thus allows a curl of much 
smaller diameter to be obtained. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a machine for forming a curl at the end of a metal 
cylindrical element such as, for example, a can body, 
comprising a base onto which in use the element fits and a 
tool-holder head for covering the end of the element end, 
the base and the tool-holder head assuming a common axis 
and being spaced from one another, and means for bringing 
about a controlled axial drawing together of the base and 
the tool-holder head, characterised in that the machine 
further comprises rotating means for driving the 
tool-holder head or the base around the common axis and in 
that the tool-holder head is provided with a plurality of 
rollers arranged in a circle and concentrically to the 
common axis, each provided with a curling groove and 
mounted in free rotation along approximately coplanar 
axes, perpendicular to and cutting the common axis.  According to another advantageous characteristic of 
the invention, each roller is mounted so as to be moveable 
along the direction of its own axis of rotation within a 
predetermined clearance of the order of a tenth of a 
millimetre. This clearance allows a self-centering of the 
rollers when these enter into contact with the edge to be 
curled. In a preferred embodiment, the rollers are 
distributed unevenly in a circle. This particular feature 
makes it possible to prevent the cylindrical element 
losing its cylindrical shape (which would result in a 
shape presenting faintly delineated longitudinal facettes)
