<ABSTRACT>
A cassette, comprising at least two parts, for recording carriers is distinguished by high resistance to breaking if the walls, of the parts, which are to be connected are connected by means of pinch-off edge welding with the welding areas additionally of a tongue-and-groove design. The invention can be used advantageously for every type of cassettes for recording carriers, such as magnetic-tape, film, ink-ribbon and other cassettes or cartridges.

<CLAIMS>
A cartridge for recording media in tape form, in
particular a single-reel cartridge for data recording,

having a plastic housing, comprising at least two housing
parts (1, 2) with bottom and top and side walls (3-6 and

7-10), at least the side walls being welded to one
another, wherein, to increase the strength and fracture

resistance of the housing, a tongue-and-groove formation
(17 and 19, 21 and 22) of the side walls (3-6 and 7-10)

to be welded, and, if appropriate, of the inner walls
(11A and 20), is provided and the tongue-and-groove

regions (17 and 19, 21 and 22) of the side walls (3-6 and
7-10) to be welded, and, if appropriate, of the inner

walls (11A and 20), are welded to one another by the
pinched-edge principle.
A cartridge as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
insertion region of the groove part (19, 22) of the walls

(3-6, 7-10, 11A, 20) to be welded is designed with
rounded-off edges.
A cartridge as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
the tongue part (17, 21) of the walls (3-6, 7-10, 11A,

20) to be welded is designed with a beveled surface (18,
25) on the end face.
A cartridge as claimed in claim 1 and one or more
of claims 2 and 3, wherein there are no additional

ejector elevations on the housing parts (1, 2).
A cartridge as claimed in claim 1 and one or more
of claims 2 to 4, wherein the cartridge is a single-reel

magnetic tape cartridge (M).
