<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to electrochemical devices comprise at least a 
pair of electrodes and a lithium ion conductive electrolyte provided between 

the pair of electrodes. At least one of the electrodes comprises a lithium 
nitride-metal compound having a one-dimensional chain structure. By this, 

the number of end groups which greatly take part in characteristic 
degradation of the device can be reduced significantly, ensuring good 

characteristic properties. The devices include lithium secondary cells, 
electric double-layer capacitors, and electrochemical display devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrochemical devices including, for
example, lithium secondary cells and more particularly, to
electrochemical devices which make use of lithium nitride-metal
compounds as at least one electrode thereof.Investigations have been hitherto made on transition metal oxides
such as, for example, LixCoO2, LixNiO2, LixMnO2 and the like, for use as
an active material for the positive electrode of lithium secondary cells.
Likewise, substances having various types of layered structures, such
as graphite, have been studied for use as an active substance for the
negative electrode.Where these substances are, respectively, employed as the active
substance for the electrodes, their crystal structures greatly influence
the electrochemical oxidation and reduction cycles of the cell. For
instance, the crystal structure of the transition metal oxide such as
LiNiO2 is a kind of layered structure wherein infinite chains of edge- or
apex-sharing tetrahedra or octahedra, in which transition metal
element ions are bonded with oxygen ions through six or four
coordinations, extend two-dimensionally. In the layered structure,
lithium elements are intercalated. When a substance having such a 
layered structure as mentioned above is subjected to electrochemical
polarization, lithium ions are intercalated in or de-intercalated from the
layered structure and act as an active substance for the electrode.In case where substances having the layered structure as
mentioned above are used as an active substance for electrode, the
electrochemical reaction which takes place will be a so-called
topochemical reaction wherein ions are merely intercalated in or de-intercalated
from the crystal layers of the layered structure. As a
consequence, any appreciable change in the crystal structure does not
take place, so that high reversibility is ensured with respect to the
repetition of the electrochemical redox reaction cycles.However, the use of the transition metal oxides as the active
substance has the following problems to solve.The crystals of transition metal oxides and graphite have such a
two-dimensional structure as set out hereinabove. The materials used
as the active substance have a limited, finite dimension. The two-dimensional
structure breaks off on the surface of the material. With
transition metal oxides such as LiNiO2, the oxygen ions become
"terminated", for example, in the form of -OH, -OLi or other end groups.If these materials are used as the active substance, the
electrochemical reactions include
