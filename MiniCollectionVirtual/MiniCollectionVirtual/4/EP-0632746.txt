<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to water sterilization equipment, and more
particularly, to an electrolytic cell for generating oxidant solutions that include
ozone.Maintaining the sterility of drinking water supplies is a major factor in
reducing the health risks to the human population. While large metropolitan water
systems can make use of highly toxic chlorine gas for sterilizing drinking water,
such systems are impractical in remote locations which lack highly trained
personnel and the equipment to maintain the systems. To be effective in rural
settings, a system must be capable of running for long periods of time with little or
no maintenance. In addition, the raw materials required by the system must be
readily available.Systems based on the electrolytic production of chlorine and ozone based
germicidal agents are particularly attractive. These systems require only
electricity and common salt as raw materials. One such system is described in
U.S. Patent 4,761,208 to Gram, et al.
This system utilizes an electrolytical cell to generate a mixed stream of oxidants
including chlorine compounds, ozone, and H2O2 from common salt. This oxidant
stream may be added directly to the drinking water at a high dilution ratio, thereby
sterilizing the drinking water without causing the water to become unpalatable.
This system is particularly attractive because of its simplicity and long
maintenance free operation time.While this system represents a major improvement over the prior systems,
it is less than optimal. For example, the most effective mixed oxidant stream has
been found to be an oxidant stream in which the ratio of ozone and H2O2 to the
chlorine based compounds is maximized. In addition to providing more effective 
sterilization, the ozone and H2O2 oxidants provide a more palatable drinking water supply.Broadly, it is the object of the present invention to provide an improved mixed oxidant
generating system.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a mixed oxidant generating a system
with increased ratios of ozone to chlorine based compounds.These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the
art from the following detailed description of the invention and the accompanying drawings.The present invention comprises an apparatus for generating a mixed oxidant stream including
ozone, said apparatus comprising: anode means comprising a substantially planar first surface;
cathode means comprising a substantially planar second surface, said second
