<ABSTRACT>
A cascaded amplifier is comprised of a number of amplifying 
stages connected in cascade such as the dual emitter-coupled 

amplifier shown. A first pair of transistors (14,20) provides 
limiting amplification and a second pair of transistors (16,18) 

with degeneration (22,24) provide linear amplification. Each 
pair of transistors is driven by a current source (28,26) which 

supplies a current (IT, IT2) proportional to absolute temperature 
(PTAT). The small signal amplification is then substantially 

independent of temperature and the value of the limited output is 
proportional to absolute temperature. This latter effect is 

countered by including a translinear variable current gain 
amplifier (54,56,58,60) in the last dual-gain stage of the 

cascaded amplifier to modify the output voltage in a manner 
inversely proportional to absolute temperature. A transfer 

function may thus be provided which is substantially independent 
of temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cascaded amplifier with
temperature compensation having particular, but not exclusive,
application for use as a logarithmic amplifier for dynamic range
reduction in radio receiver applications.Piecewise approximations to logarithmic transfer functions
are known to be provided by cascaded amplifiers comprising
several amplifying stages. A true logarithmic amplifier is the
name given to a logarithmic amplifier whose output retains
information about the sign of the input signal as opposed to
amplifiers which rectify the input signal to provide an output
which is logarithmically proportional to the magnitude of the
input signal only. Such an amplifier is described in "A True
Logarithmic Amplifier for Radar IF Applications" by William L.
Barber and Edmund R. Brown in the IEEE Journal of Solid-State
Circuits, Vol. SC-15, No. 3, June 1980. The paper describes a
logarithmic amplifier which consists of a cascade of dual gain
amplifying stages. Each stage comprises a limiting amplifier
designed to be driven into limiting at a given input voltage and
a unity gain amplifier arranged in parallel with the limiting
amplifier. As the input level to the cascaded amplifier rises,
the limiting amplifiers in consecutive dual gain stages are
driven into limiting, starting with the last one in the chain.
The overall gain of the amplifier decreases as the input voltage
level rises and a piecewise approximation to a logarithmic
function results. The larger the number of amplifier stages, the
more accurate is the approximation to the function and/or the
greater the input dynamic range with which the amplifier can
operate. The small signal gain of each amplifier stage in a
typical logarithmic amplifier might be 10dB.The amplifier stages described in the above-mentioned 
article each comprise two long-tailed pair transistor amplifiers
driving a common load resistor. One of the long-tailed pairs has
degeneration to provide a unity gain amplifier with no limiting
and the other has no degeneration (other than that inherent in
the transistors) to provide an amplifier having a high gain for
small-signal inputs but which limits at larger signal inputs. A
cascaded chain of such amplifier stages can be arranged to give a
good approximation to a logarithmic transfer function.The main drawback of this known design of cascaded amplifier
is that the amplitude transfer characteristics vary widely with
variations in temperature.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
cascaded amplifier with
