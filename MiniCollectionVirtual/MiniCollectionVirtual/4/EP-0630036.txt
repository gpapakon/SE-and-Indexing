<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and methods for reducing 
electric field emissions of a cathode ray tube (CRT) display by the 
addition of cancellation fields. A conventional raster scanned CRT display such as a television 
receiver or a computer visual display unit comprises circuitry that can 
generate electric fields of sufficient strength to radiate beyond the 
display. Various studies have raised public concern about these electric 
fields and the possible health hazards associated with them. As a result 
of these concerns various standards have been introduced defining maximum 
emission levels which products claiming to meet these standards can emit. 
In Northern Europe, products can be tested to a standard developed and 
administered by TCO, the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees. 
To meet this standard, true rms values of emissions in the frequency band 
from 2 kHz to 400 kHz are measured and must be less than 1 volt/metre. A CRT display typically comprises horizontal and vertical 
electromagnetic deflection coils arranged on a yoke mounted around the 
neck of the CRT. In operation, currents having a sawtooth shaped 
waveform flow through the deflection coils to scan the electron beam or 
beams across the CRT screen in a raster pattern. The voltages across the 
deflection coils reach a peak during the retrace or flyback period of the 
sawtooth currents. The peak voltage signals have a large component of 
harmonics of the corresponding deflection frequencies. The electron beam or beams are accelerated from the neck of the CRT 
to the screen by a "final anode" or Extra High Tension (EHT) voltage of 
typically 25 kV for a colour display. The flow of electrons is referred 
to as "beam current". The EHT voltage is typically generated from a step 
up transformer synchronised to the line scan. In displays having 
integrated EHT generation and horizontal deflection circuits, the voltage 
pulse signal driving the primary of the transformer is derived from the 
peak voltage across the horizontal deflection coil. In displays having  
 
separate EHT generation and horizontal deflection circuits, the voltage 
pulse signal is generated separately from the line scan signal, but may 
be synchronised with it, although not necessarily in phase. The output impedance of the EHT generator is sufficiently high that 
changes in beam current loading through screen content cause modulation 
of the EHT voltage. This is the primary source of radiated electric 
fields in front of the display. This
