<ABSTRACT>
The carousel according to the invention comprises a table (1) carrying a series of rockers (2) intended to support the bottles (cylinders), means for making the table turn in order to transfer the bottles from a loading station (A) to an unloading station (B), robots (automatons) (3) for introducing controlled quantities of gas into the bottles while they are being transferred from the loading station to the unloading station, and a rotating joint (4) to allow the robots to be supplied with gas and with compressed air. The table (1) supports a pneumatic motor (5) supplied with compressed air from the rotating joint (4), an electric-current generator (6) intended to be driven by the pneumatic motor (5) and an electric circuit with intrinsic safety housed in an anti-explosion box (12) and connected to the generator (6) in order to supply the robots (3) with electrical current.

A carousel for filling gas bottles, of the type 
comprising a supporting plate (1) provided with a number 

of tilting devices (2) uniformly spaced along its 
periphery and intended to support the bottles, with means 

enabling the plate to turn in order to transfer the 
bottles from a loading station (A) to an unloading 

station (B), with automatic devices (3) associated with 
the tilting devices for introducing controlled quantities 

of gas into the bottles during their journey from the 
loading station to the unloading station, and with a 

rotatable joint (4) placed in the centre of the plate to 
enable the supply of gas and compressed air to the 

automatic devices, characterised in that the plate (1) 
supports a pneumatic motor (5) fed with compressed air 

originating from the rotatable joint(4), an electric 
current generator (6) intended to be driven by the 

pneumatic motor (5) and a total security electrical 
circuit (7) connected to the generator (6) and intended 

to feed the automatic devices (3) with electric current. 
A carousel according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the electrical circuit (7) is disposed in an 

explosion proof enclosure (12) and comprises a voltage 
regulator (13) whose input is connected to the the 

generator output (6), a battery (14) whose end terminals 
are connected to the output of the voltage regulator 

(13), a converter (15) whose input is connected to the 
end terminals of the battery (14) and total security 

barriers (16) whose inputs are connected to the output of 
the converter (15) and whose outputs (17) are 

respectively connected to the automatic devices (3). 
A carousel according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the generator (6) is explosion prooof. 
A carousel according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the generator (6) is located inside an explosion 

proof enclosure (12). 
A carousel according to any one of claims 2 to 4,  
 

characterised in that the generator (6) is conceived 
to produce a continuous 24V electric current, at 4 to 8 

A. 
A carousel according to any one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the battery (14) is capable of 

delivering a continuous 24V current, at 4 to 8A. 
A carousel according to any one of claims 2 to 6, 
characterised in that the total security barriers (16) 

are capable of delivering an electric current of the 
order of ± 5 to ± 10V and at 100 mA.
