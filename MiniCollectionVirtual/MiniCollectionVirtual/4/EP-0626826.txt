<ABSTRACT>
A handpiece for use in transmyocardial revascularization heart-synchronized pulsed laser system includes a barrel (24) having a passage (62) for transmitting a laser beam; a surface (32) at the distal end of the barrel for contacting the wall of the heart (66); an aperture (26) located at the distal end of the barrel in the enlarged surface (32) for transmitting the laser beam; and means for focusing (42) the laser beam proximate to the aperture to vaporize the tissue of the heart wall and create a hole to the interior heart chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a handpiece for use in a
transmyocardial vascularization heart-synchronized pulsed
laser system, and more particularly to such a handpiece whose
contact surface avoids destabilization of the beating heart.Transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) is an alternative
technique to bypass surgery for increasing blood flow to the
heart muscle. It involves the puncturing of the heart wall
with a laser to form a plurality of holes which heal on the
outside but remain open on the inside of the heart, to provide
an alternative source of blood to the heart muscle. This
technique has been employed on a stilled, by-passed heart
using a CO2 laser with a hand-piece which rests on the heart in
order to ensure that the laser beam focus occurs at the
correct point on the heart. Recently, a dramatic improvement
in TMR has enabled this technique to be used on a beating
heart without the need to slow or still it. This has been
accomplished with an innovative synchronizing approach. 
However, this has introduced new problems. A beating heart is electrically active;
the contact of a handpiece against the heart wall disrupts that electrical activity and interferes
with the heart function. Arrhythmia and fibrillation can occur and can result in heart failure.
Further, any interference with the electrical field of the heart interrupts the synchronous
operation of the laser so that the laser is no longer constrained to fire at the optimum moment
in the beating heart cycle. The current handpieces used with CO2 lasers have a relatively sharp
tip on a gauge rod extending from the end of the handpiece used to consistently position the
handpiece at the proper distance from the stilled heart wall for accurate laser beam focusing
and impingement. Such a tip creates increased pressure on the heart, which can cuase
arrhythmia, fibrillation, and can even puncture the wall of the heart. Further, with these
handpieces it is difficult to maintain the laser beam perpendicular with the wall of a beating
heart as is necessary to effect clean, correctly placed holes in the heart wall.US specification 4,850,352 discloses a laser-surgical instrument with a barrel, a passage for
transmitting the laser beam, a focusing system and an evacuation tip. A sheath surrounds the
tip and is spaced apart from it to allow passage of purge gas. The sheath can be extended
beyond the tip to permit evacuation.According to the invention there is provided a handpiece for use in a pulsed laser surgical
system comprising: means for focusing a

<CLAIMS>
A handpiece for use in a pulsed laser surgical system comprising:

means for focusing (22) a laser beam and a barrel (24) having a passage (62) for transmitting
the laser beam, the barrel terminating at a distal end (30) having an aperture (26) for exit of

the laser beam 
characterised in that
 the distal end of the barrel has an enlarged end surface (32)
surrounding the aperture adapted for stable contact with a beating heart in a heart-synchronised

transmyocardial revascularisation procedure, said enlarged end surface being smooth, flat
and extending continuously from the aperture so as to provide a stable contact platform for

maintaining perpendicularity between the beam and the heart, and the means for
focusing is adapted to focus the laser beam proximate the aperture to vapourise the

tissue of the heart wall and create a hole to the interior heart chamber.
A handpiece according to claim 1 in which the enlarged end surface (32) is thermally insulating.
A handpiece according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which the means for focusing comprises a

lens or lens unit that enables the laser to be focused at, near or beyond the aperture.
A handpiece according to any preceding claim further including means (44) for introducing
a gas to purge the passage (42) between the aperture and the means for focusing of debris produced by vaporisation of the heart wall.
A handpiece according to claim 4 further including exhaust means (70, 72) in
communication with the passage (62) for venting debris purged by the gas.
A handpiece according to claim 5 in which the exhaust means (70, 72) is located proximate
the aperture (26).
A handpiece according to any preceding claim in which the end surface (32) is greater than
0.01 metres in diameter.
A handpiece according to any preceding claim in which the end surface (32) is in the form
of a flange extending from the barrel (24) and has rounded edges. 
A handpiece according to any preceding claim in which the barrel (24) is straight.
A handpiece according to any of claims 1 to 8 in which the barrel (24) is angled and
includes deflecting means (80) for directing the laser beam along the angled barrel.
A handpiece according to claim 10 in which the deflecting means includes a mirror (82).
