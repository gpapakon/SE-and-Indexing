<ABSTRACT>
System for preparing liquids from at least one solid and from at least one liquid phase. The system comprises a vessel in which the solid or solids are situated and a dry chamber which is connected to the vessel or can be connected to the vessel. The dry chamber is separated from the vessel interior by a separating means which is permeable to water vapour but is impermeable to liquids. The system is suitable for the production of liquids from moisture-sensitive solids. These solids can be stored in the vessel, since the atmospheric humidity in the interior is decreased by the desiccant. The liquid can be prepared in one and the same vessel by addition of a liquid phase, since the desiccant is separated off from the vessel interior.

System for the preparation of a liquid from at
least one solid and at least one liquid phase

characterized by the combination of the following
elements:


a vessel which contains at least the said one
solid and has a volume which is sufficient to

receive at least the one solid and the at least
one liquid phase;
a desiccant chamber (4) coupled to the vessel which
contains a desiccant;
a separating element (6) permeable to water
vapour which closes the desiccant chamber and

which has a critical surface tension for wetting
which is less than 70 mN/m

in such a way that the desiccant can exchange water
vapour at any time with the contents of the vessel

and direct contact of liquid or solid contents of
the vessel with the desiccant is essentially

impossible.
System as claimed in claim 1, wherein the chamber
containing desiccant serves to close the vessel. 
System as claimed in one of the previous claims,
wherein the vessel is composed of a material which

is at least partially permeable to water vapour.
System as claimed in claim 3, wherein cardboard is
used as the material for the separating element.
System as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4,
wherein a material is used as the separating

element which has a critical surface tension for
the wetting which is in the range of 25 to 65 mN/m

and preferably in the range of 30 to 40 mN/m.
Use of a preparation system as claimed in one of
the claims 1 to 5 for the production of reagent

solutions.
Process for the production of a liquid using a
preparation system as claimed in one of the claims

1 to 5 comprising the following steps:

a) storage of the solid in a closed vessel
b) opening the vessel
c) addition of liquid phase to the solid in the
vessel
d) mixing solid and liquid phase so that a
solution, suspension or emulsion is formed.
Process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the chamber
containing the desiccant is used to close the

vessel before as well as after addition of the
liquid.
Process as claimed in one of the claims 7 and 8,
wherein the vessel is filled with the solid in an

atmosphere containing water vapour.
Process as claimed in one of the claims 7 to 9,
wherein filling of the vessel with the liquid phase

is carried out automatically by a device.
Process as claimed in one of the claims 7 to 10,
wherein prepared liquid is withdrawn automatically

from the vessel by a device.
Process as claimed in one of the claims 7 to 11,
wherein the preparation of the liquid as well as

its use is achieved by a device.
Process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the storage
of the solid component in the closed vessel serves

to dry it or/and maintain dryness.
Process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the opening
of the vessel in step b) is achieved by piercing

with a cannula.
Process as claimed in claim 7, in which the vessel
is closed after addition of the liquid phase.
