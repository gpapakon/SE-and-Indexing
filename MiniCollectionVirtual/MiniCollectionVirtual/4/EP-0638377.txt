Punch head (10) in a corner joining machine for the
joining of hollow section pieces (1), which have several

corner angles (6,7) staggered with respect to each other
perpendicularly to the surface in which the hollow section

pieces (1) lie, in which

a) the punch head (10) contains a first punch body (13)
which is arranged so as to be displaceable parallel to a first

shank of a corner angle (6, 7) connecting the hollow section
piece (1),
b) tools (9) are able to be inserted into the punch body
(13) which act at given points of the hollow section piece (1)

thereon from the exterior,
c) the punch head (10) has at least a second punch body (14)
arranged so as to be displaceable and arrestable with respect

to the first punch body (13) and with an insertable tool (8),
d) the second punch body (14) is arranged so as to be
displaceable with respect to the first punch body (13)

parallel to the surface in which the hollow section pieces (1)
lie, and
e) the second punch body (14) is arranged on the first punch
body (13), so that the tools (8, 9) of both punch bodies (13,

14) act on the hollow section piece (1) simultaneously at
several points lying staggered perpendicularly to the surface

in which the hollow section pieces (1) lie.
Punch head according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the second punch body (14) with the aid of a mechanical guide

(18) is arranged on the first punch body (13) and so as to be
transversely displaceable at a given angle. 
Punch head according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the two punch bodies (13, 14) are connected with each

other with a form fit by means of a mechanical guide (18).
Punch head according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
