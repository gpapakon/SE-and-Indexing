<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
manufacturing device and more particularly to a polishing 
apparatus for polishing a semiconductor substrate to 
be flattened. FIG. 10 shows a conventional polishing apparatus. 
A guide ring 12 is provided around the back face of a 
top plate 11, and an interlayer material 13 is provided 
on the back face of the top plate 11, which is positioned 
at the inside of the guide ring 12. The 
interlayer material 13 is a cloth to which water 
penetrates, for example. A semiconductor substrate 
(wafer) 14 is attracted to the back face of the top 
plate 11 by the interlayer material 13. As a method 
for absorbing the wafer 14 to the top plate 11, wax or 
vacuum chuck can be used. In the case where wax is 
used, wax is applied on the back surface of the top 
plate 11, whereby the wafer is attracted to the top 
plate 11. In the case where vacuum chuck is used, a 
plurality of intake paths are provided. The wafer, 
which is attracted to the top plate 11, has a diameter 
larger than the top plate 11, and is mounted on a 
polishing plate (not shown) having a polishing cloth is 
provided on its surface. The polishing plate and the 
top plate 11 are rotated in a fixed direction, and the 
wafer is polished by polishing material, which is 
applied on the polishing cloth.  
 According to the conventional polishing apparatus, 
it was difficult to control the temperature of the wafer 
when polishing. In other words, the temperature of the 
wafer is increased by friction of the polishing cloth 
on the wafer and a chemical reaction between the wafer 
and the polishing material. Due to this, each surface 
temperature of respective portions of the wafer is not 
constant. Moreover, a plurality of the wafers are 
mounted on the polishing plate at one time, and polished 
simultaneously. However, each temperature of the 
respective wafers, which are simultaneously polished, 
was not able to set to be constant. The polishing rate 
(film thickness/minute: nm/min) depends on the temperature 
at the time of polishing. Due to this, the polishing 
rate of each surface of the respective portions of 
the wafer cannot be equalized. Moreover, the polishing 
rate of each of the wafers, which are simultaneously 
polished, and the polishing rate of each batch were not 
able to be equalized. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
polishing apparatus, which can equalize a polishing rate 
of each surface of the respective portion of a semiconductor 
substrate, and which can equalize a
