<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a seal, to a method for manufacturing it, and to a method for hermetic closure employing such a seal. A seal (6) according to the invention includes a scraper (7, 7') or wiper which, at the moment of insertion, cleans the contact surface. The shape of the scraper (7, 7') is adapted to the space available for the insertion of the seal (6) so as to prevent incorrect fitting or damage of the seal (6). The invention applies to the sealed assembly of tubular pipes and/or rods, as well as to the hermetic closure of containers containing a heavy material, especially a powder.

<CLAIMS>
A method of securely assembling a seal (6) of resilient material to a tube
(2), said seal presenting first and second ends, and an annular scraper (7)

disposed on its outside face at a certain distance from the first end, said
method being 
characterized in that
 it consists in engaging, in the tube (2) of
inside diameter d4, the seal (6) of outside diameter d3 that is substantially

equal to or less than d4, via its second end so that said scraper (7) of outside
diameter d6, greater than d4, ensures that the inside surface (5) of the tube

(2) intended to be in fixed contact with the seal (6) is cleaned by crushing,
over a length corresponding substantially to the distance between the scraper

and said first end of the seal.
A method of securely assembling a seal (6) of resilient material to a tube
(1), said seal presenting first and second ends, and an annular scraper (7')

disposed on its inside face at a certain distance from the first end, said
method being 
characterized in that
 it consists in engaging, around the tube (1)
of outside diameter d1, the seal (6) of inside diameter d2 that is substantially

equal to or greater than d1, via its second end so that said scraper (7') of
inside diameter d5, smaller than said d1, ensures that the outside surface (5)

of the tube (1) intended to be in fixed contact with the seal (6) is cleaned by
crushing, over a length corresponding substantially to the distance between

the scraper and the second end of the seal.
A method according to claim 1 and claim 2, 
characterized in that
 it consists
in securely assembling a tubular seal (6) between a first tube (2) and a

second tube (1), said seal (6) thus presenting two annular scrapers (7, 7')
respectively situated on its outside and inside faces.
A method according to claim 1 or 3, 
characterized in that
 it consists in
completing assembly with a clamping operation in order to perfect the sealing

between the tube (2) and the seal (6).
The secure assembly of a seal (6) of resilient material to a tube (2), said
seal presenting an annular scraper (7) disposed on its outside face and

housed inside said tube (2), said assembly being 
characterized in that
 the
diameter d3 of the outside surface of the seal (6) is substantially equal to or 

less than the inside diameter d4 of the tube (2), the scraper presenting with
assembly an outside diameter d6 that is greater than said diameter d4.
The secure assembly of a tubular seal (6) of resilient material to a tube (1),
said seal presenting an annular scraper (7') disposed on its inside
 face and
being mounted around said tube, said assembly being 
characterized in that

the diameter d2 of the inside surface of the tubular seal is substantially equal
to or greater than the outside diameter d1 of the tube, the annular scraper (7')

presenting before assembly an inside diameter d5 that is smaller than the
diameter d1.
An assembly according to claim 5 and claim 6, 
characterized in that
 it
includes two tubes (1, 2), the tubular seal (6) thus being mounted between the

tubes and presenting both the annular scraper (7) disposed on the outside
face, and the annular scraper (7') disposed on the inside face.
An assembly according to claim 5 or 7, 
characterized in that
 the tube (2) is
also clamped on the seal (6).
An assembly according to any one of claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that

the seal is made of a material having hardness lying in the range 65 to 90 on
the Shore A scale, and preferably substantially equal to 75 on the Shore A

scale.
An assembly according to any one of claims 5 to 9, 
characterized in that

the seal is manufactured in a two-part mold.
