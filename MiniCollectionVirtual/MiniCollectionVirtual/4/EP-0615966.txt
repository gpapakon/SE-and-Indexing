<ABSTRACT>
Metal matrix composite articles are produced by coating ceramic 
fibres (21) with alternating layers of dissimilar matrix materials (8,9) 

to an aggregate thickness sufficient to yield the intended matrix volume 
fraction in the consolidated product. Fibre coating is by vapour phase 

deposition methods such as vapour condensation, sputtering or chemical 
vapour reaction. Fibres are given an aggregate coating of at least 5% of 

fibre radius, preferably at least 20%. Articles are obtained from coated 
fibres by consolidation of an assembly of the fibres under conditions of 

elevated temperature and pressure to cause inter-fibre matrix flow and 
bonding between adjacent coatings. Coated fibres are reaction treated to 

cause the respective matrix materials to combine to form intermetallic 
species as strata between layers of unreacted matrix material. This 

reaction treatment may be performed concurrently with consolidation or 
may be carried out in a separate step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for making articles 
from metal matrix composite materials using matrix coated ceramic 
fibres, and in particular to a process for making such articles to 
near net shape for use in applications requiring improved damage 
tolerance compared with current metal matrix composites. Ceramic fibre reinforcements are used in metal matrix composites 
for structural applications in order to add strength or stiffness to 
the matrix metal. Such materials are of potential interest in a wide 
variety of aerospace applications embracing both airframe and engine 
components. Aluminium, titanium and nickel based alloys could all be 
used for the matrix material in appropriate applications where some 
improvement is sought over the properties offered by unreinforced 
monolithic material. Typical material targets might be high 
temperature titanium alloy turbine blades, and high stiffness 
lightweight aluminium alloy airframe components or aircraft skins. Conventionally, long fibre reinforced metal matrix composites for 
structural applications are produced either by consolidation of a 
fibre/foil or fibre/powder preproduct or else by liquid metal 
infiltration of a fibre preproduct. These production routes do not 
lend themselves to the production of metal matrix composites with 
complex geometry. It is known to use a barrier layer or layers upon 
ceramic fibres to limit reaction with a matrix metal such as titanium. 
The prior art also includes proposals to place a single layer of 
dissimilar material between reinforcement and matrix to achieve a 
better sharing of load between the two. Neither reaction barrier 
layers nor load transfer layers are intended to impart any structural 
attribute to the composite other than the effect which they exert on 
the reinforcement/matrix interface. They do not alter in any way the 
damage tolerance properties of the matrix as the present invention 
seeks to do. In some prior art materials, sheets of monolithic-matrix 
composites are laminated on a macroscopic scale with sheets of 
unreinforced materials or dissimilar sheets of metal composites so  
 
that the completed laminate has attributes traceable to both 
constituent sheets. Such laminates have significantly greater 
interlayer distances than might be desirable for structural 
considerations alone and they are significantly anisotropic, being the 
product of laminated sheets. It is an object of this invention to provide a process for 
producing near net shape metal matrix composite

<CLAIMS>
A process for making articles from metal matrix composite 
materials using matrix-coated ceramic fibres, comprising the steps of: 


(a) depositing upon the ceramic fibres a first layer of a first 
matrix material; 
(b) depositing upon the first layer coated fibres a second layer of a 
second matrix material, said second layer being thin relative to 

the thickness of the first layer; 
(c) depositing upon the second layer coated fibres a further layer of 
said first matrix material, said further layer being of comparable 

thickness to said first layer; 
(d) optionally depositing additional layers of said second and first 
matrix materials in alternating sequence and in comparable relative 

thicknesses to corresponding preceding layers, and 
(e) consolidating under heat and pressure an assembly of fibres coated 
in accordance with steps (a) to (d) above, 
 
characterised in that the coated fibres are subjected to a reaction 

treatment which causes the first and second matrix materials to 
combine to form intermetallic species in strata between successive 

layers of unreacted first matrix material. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 further characterised in that the 
coated fibres additionally include layers of a third or further 

materials deposited as interlayers between the respective layers of 
said first and second matrix materials. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 further characterised 
in that the consolidation step (e) is carried out at a sufficient 

temperature and for a sufficiently long duration to effect the desired 
reaction between the first and second matrix materials.  

 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim further characterised 
in that the combined thickness of the successive first and second 

matrix material amounts to at least 5% of the fibre radius. 
A process as claimed in cliam 4 further characterised in that the 
combined thickness of the successive first and second matrix material 

amounts to at least 20% of the fibre radius. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim further characterised 
in that the first matrix material is selected from the group 

comprising titanium, aluminium, titanium alloys or aluminium alloys. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim further characterised 
in that the strata of intermetallic material formed in the reaction 

step are sufficiently thick to prevent unifying diffusion bonding 
between adjacent layers of unreacted first matrix material.
