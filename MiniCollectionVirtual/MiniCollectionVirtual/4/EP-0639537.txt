<ABSTRACT>
Material selected from the group consisting 
essentially of molybdenum, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, copper, 

silver, potassium dichromate and iron chromite, is added 
during the manufacture of soda-lime-silica float glass to 

reduce the occurrences of nickel sulfide stone defects. 
Material is added in sufficient amounts such that the 

resulting glass is at least 0.010 wt. % of the selected 
material. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, 

molybdenum is added in the form of sodium molybdate such that 
the resulting glass is at least 0.015 wt. % molybdenum.

<DESCRIPTION>
Small particles of nickel sulfide (NiS) usually known 
as nickel sulfide "stones" sometimes occur in glass and result 
in severe degradation of the glass quality. Nickel sulfide 
stones are usually too small to be seen by the unaided eye and 
are very difficult to be detected by optical inspection means. 
Nickel sulfide stones as small as 40 microns may cause 
spontaneous breakage in tempered glass parts. This breakage 
is related, in part, to the slow phase change in the nickel 
sulfide stones which create localized stresses. Increased 
temperature may accelerate the phase change. In addition, 
there is a large difference between the coefficient of thermal 
expansion of nickel sulfide stones and that of glass. As a 
result, change in temperature of a glass product, such as a 
glass sheet installed in a building or a vehicle, that 
includes a nickel sulfide stone may further cause intense 
localized stresses in the vicinity of the stone which may be 
of sufficient magnitude to spontaneously fracture the sheet. 
Because it is difficult to detect the presence of nickel 
sulfide stones in glass, and because their effects may not be 
exhibited until long after the glass sheets have been 
installed, prevention of nickel sulfide stones is an important 
objective for glass makers. The most straight forward approach to avoiding nickel 
sulfide stones is to prevent any source of nickel from 
entering the glass melting furnace; however trace amounts of 
nickel may appear as naturally occurring impurities in the raw 
materials used for making glass. Also, the common presence of 
nickel in stainless steel alloys used in equipment associated  
 
with the raw materials mining and handling and other machinery 
associated with a glass melting operation may lead to the 
inadvertent introduction of small amounts of nickel into the 
glass melting furnace, even when strenuous efforts are made to 
avoid its deliberate introduction. In addition, in some glass 
compositions, quantities of nickel are added to the batch as a 
colorant. Nickel may also be found in glass cullet used to 
make the glass. It would be desirable if formation of nickel sulfide 
stones could be prevented in the output from a glass melting 
furnace in which nickel is present. U.S. Patent No. 4,919,698 reduces the occurrence of 
nickel sulfide stones in glass by electrically imposing 
oxidizing conditions near the bottom of a melting furnace and 
at least at a portion of the region between the inlet end and 
spring zone of the furnace to prevent the
