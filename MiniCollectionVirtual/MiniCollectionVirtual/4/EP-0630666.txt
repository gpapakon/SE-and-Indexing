<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyurea compositions,
methods for manufacture thereof, and to products
formed of those compositions. The invention
particularly relates to golf balls which employ covers
formed of polyurea compositions.There are only a few materials which are
considered suitable for golf ball covers. Balata, a
naturally occurring material which can also be made
synthetically, was the material of choice until the
mid-1960's. Balata was known for its great "click"
and "feel". In the 1960's, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &
Company came out with a new plastic product, an
ionomer which was sold under the name SURLYN®.
SURLYN®, however, is hard as compared to balata and
many golfers continue to prefer balata because of its
"click" and "feel".The search has continued for a golf ball cover
material with the durability of SURLYN® and the "click"
and "feel" of balata. Polyurethanes have been
considered for quite a few years because they meet the
requirements of both durability and good "click" and
"feel"; a disadvantage of polyurethanes, however, has
been processability.Examples of such polyurethanes are described in EP-A-467622.Although polyureas, such as those described in EP-A-279376, are
known in the art, these compounds have not been used for making
golf balls.A need therefore continues to exist for golf ball
cover materials which have improved click and feel, as
well as improved shear and cut resistance. Polyurea compositions comprising the reaction
product of an organic isocyanate and an organic amine,
each having at least two functional groups are
disclosed. Golf balls employing covers formed of
those polyurea compositions also are disclosed.In accordance with the invention, polyureas are
produced by reacting an isocyanate and an amine curing
agent. The amine curing agent is an organic di-functional
amine. Optionally, a tri-functional amine
may be employed. Polyureas manufactured by reacting
isocyanates and the amine curing agents in accordance
with the invention can be processed over a wide
temperature range.The method of the invention entails reacting an
amine curing agent and an isocyanate in a mole
equivalent ratio sufficient to form a polyurea. The
mole equivalent ratio of amine groups to isocyanate
groups may vary over a wide range.
The mole equivalent ratio of amine groups to isocyanate groups may
vary from 5.47:1 to 2.97:1.
Additional materials such as colorants, ultraviolet
light absorbers, plasticizers, and the like may be
included in the polyurea compositions of the
invention.The polyureas
