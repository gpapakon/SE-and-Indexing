<ABSTRACT>
A water suction device for scrubbing machines and the like having a non-rotatable frame, a rotatable scrubbing disc or brush (1a) and a rotatably driven holder (1) therefor, a number of nozzles (2) and a number of lips (5) which move dirty scrubbing water to the nozzles, said nozzles and lips being mounted on said brush, disc or holder at the periphery thereof with their lower ends in contact with or at a short distance from the floor, the outlets of the nozzles discharging in a rotating first ring-shaped channel (8) sealingly connected to a non-rotating second ring-shaped channel (4) on said frame, the second channel being connected to a water separator or the like. Said channels form a common channel located radially inside the periphery of the brush (1a) or disc and preferably close to the rotation axis thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a water suction device for scrubbing, 
shampooing and polishing machines as described in the introductory portion of 
claim 1. Water suction devices of the kind mentioned above are previously known, see 
WO 92/16139. The device disclosed in that document is efficient and simple but 
has some disadvantages. One disadvantage is that elements protrude radially 
from the brush or scrubbing disc so that the accessibility to narrow spaces and 
areas close to the walls enclosing the floor to be cleaned will be limited. Another 
disadvantage is that said elements, which i.e. consist of sealing rings, are large 
and must have different diameters for different brush or disc dimensions. It is an object of the present invention to simplify and improve known water 
suctions devices for scrubbing machines and the like. This object is achieved by 
the invention having the features described in the characterizing portion of the 
main claim. Fig. 1 is a vertical section along line I-I in Fig. 2 of a water suction device 
according to the invention for a scrubbing machine, Fig. 2 is a view from below of the water suction device in Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 is a sectional view showing a modification of details in Figs. 1 and 2. Numeral 1 designates a circular holder for a circular scrubbing brush 1a. Instead 
of the brush 1a the holder may be provided with a scrubbing disc. The brush 1a 
rotates in the same direction and at the same speed as the holder 1. Around the 
circumference of the holder 1 are attached a number of nozzles 2 which rotate 
together with the brush holder when the machine is in use. All the nozzles 2 are 
attached on and pass through a ring 7 which is formed or mounted on the 
circumference of the holder 1. The nozzles 2, which are formed as pipes, tubes 
or hoses, consists of durable elastic or flexible material, such as plastics or 
rubber. The nozzles are obliquely oriented in relation to the floor, which can be 
seen in Fig. 2, and the lower ends thereof are positioned just above or in contact 
with the floor. The lower openings of the nozzles are flush with the floor and 
glide on or move just above the floor when the machine is in use. On the underside of the ring 7 there are attached a number of obliquely angled, 
flexible flaps or lips 5 which are in contact with the floor. In order to regulate or 
adjust the pressure of the lips 5 towards the floor and/or the distance between 
the lower ends of the lips and the brush 1a, respectively, each lip 5 is mounted 
on a member

<CLAIMS>
A water suction device for scrubbing machines and the 
like having a non-rotatable frame, a rotatable scrubbing 
disc 
or brush (1a) and a rotatably driving holder (1) therefor, a 

number of individual nozzles (2) and a number of lips (5) 
which each forms an angle to the tangent to the periphery of 

the holder (1) and which move dirty scubbing water to the 
nozzles, said nozzles and lips being mounted on said brush, 

disc or holder at the periphery thereof with their lower ends 
in contact with or at a short distance from the floor, the 

outlets of the nozzles discharging in a rotating first ring-shaped 
channel 
(8) sealingly connected to a non-rotating 
second ring-shaped channel
 (4) on said frame, the second 
channel being connected to a water separator or the like , 

characterized in that said channels (4, 8) form a common 
channel located radially inside the periphery of the brush 

(1a) or disc and preferably close to the rotation axis 
thereof, and in that tubes (10) located on the holder (1) or 

passages (11) in the holder connect each nozzle (2) to the 
first channel (8).  

 
A water suction device according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
tubes (10) or passages (11) each forms an angle with the tangent to the periphery 

of the holder which is less than 90Â° so that the dirty scrubbing water will be 
discharged to the channel with a reduced centrifugal force acting on the water 

during rotation of the machine. 
A water suction device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized by means 
(12,13; 15,16) adjusting the axial distance between the brush (1a) or disc and the 

lips (5). 
A water suction device according to claim 3, characterized in that the lips 
(5) are mounted on a ring (7) which is movable in relation to the brush or disc by 

said adjusting means (15,16). 
A water suction device according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
adjusting means comprises threads (15,16) on the ring (7) and on the brush (1a) or 

disc. 
A water suction device according to claim 3, characaterized in that each lip 
(5) is mounted on a member (12) which is movable on the holder (1) and lockable 

thereto in different positions.
