<ABSTRACT>
The object to be achieved by the invention is to manage with only one drive motor (16) and a winding band (1), to avoid damage in that region of the winding core (3) which has no winding band (1) looped around it, and to achieve a more compact construction. The winding band (1) which is to be unwound from a band-supply roll (2) is fed to a winding core (3), around which it loops through virtually 360 degrees. It is then guided away from the winding core (3) again via various rollers in order thereafter, in conjunction with the winding-band part (1) running to the winding core (3), to run into the winding core (3) again and to be fastened on the winding core (3). Between them, the winding-band parts (1) guide the product stream (15) into the roll. The small region of the winding core (3) which has no winding band looped around it is covered by a bridging band (30), whereby virtually full covering of the roll-surface circumference is achieved. The associated apparatus, from the band-supply roll (2) to the winding core (3), is arranged on a framework (23) and can thus be supplied in its entirety to a subsequent machine for further processing. For this purpose, the drive system, which starts from the drive motor (16), is designed for a reversal in the drive direction for unwinding. The invention can be used in order to store, for example, printed products from rotary offset machines, folding machines, etc. and to feed said printed products to a subsequent further-processing machine, but also in order to sieze book blocks coming from a collating machine and likewise to feed these to a further-processing machine. The winding core with the stored printed products may, however, also be stored or changed separately.

Method for roll-up accumulation of printed products involving continuous winding up/unwinding 
with a single winding tape (1) spooled from a supply reel (2) onto a core (3), where the 

winding tape (1) also drives the core (3) acting first as the bottom strand and, after one 
revolution of the core (3), as the top strand for the next layer to be wound. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the winding tape (1) is unwound from the 
supply reel (2) by means of a drive tape (5) moved by a drive (6), guided over a return reel 

(13) and a feed reel (7) moved by a tape driving mechanism (8) toward the core (3) which is to 
be rotated anticlockwise, and then away from the core (3) around which it forms a loop of 

almost 360Â° and over an opposite reel (11) and deflection reel (10) moved by a tape drive (9) 
toward a reversing reel (12) from where it runs bark almost in parallel with the length of 

winding tape (1) receiving the product stream (15) and running off the return reel (13), to the 
core (3) and a fastening device (14) attaching it to the latter. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the winding tape (1) unwound from the 
supply reel (2) is fed directly via the feed reel (7) to the core (3) which is to be rotated 

anticlockwise and around which it forms a loop, and then to the opposite reel (11) away from 
the core (3) and over the deflection reel (10) and reversing reel (12) back to the core (3) to 

which it is permanently attached by the fastening device (14), with the length of winding tape 
(1) on the core (3) supplied from the reel (2) serving as the bottom strand for the printed 

products to be accumulated (15), the length of winding tape (1) newly entering the core (3) 
from the reversing reel (12) acting as the top winding strand (31), a bypass tape (30) bridging 

the non-looped region of the core (3) between the reversing reel (12) and the opposite reel 
(11) and a sheet guide (29) guiding the printed products (15) in the area of product feed to the 

product roll.  
 
Method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that winding tape (1) unwound from the 
supply reel (2) by the drive (6) is fed directly via the drive reel (36) to the core (3) to be 

rotated clockwise and around which it forms a loop, and then to the opposite reel (11), the 
deflection reel (10) and the reversing reel (12) and back from the latter to the core (3) to which 

it is permanently attached by the fastening device (14), with the length of winding tape (1) 
from the reversing reel (12) serving as the bottom strand for the printed products to be 

accumulated, the length of winding tape (1) supplied via the drive reel (36) from the reel (2) 
acting as a top strand for almost one loop and a bypass tape (30) continuously bridging the 

non-looped region of the core (3) between the opposite reel (11) and the reversing reel (12). 
Method as claimed in claims 1 and 2, or 3, or 4, characterized in that the drive (6), tape driving 
mechanism (8) and tape drive (9) operated by a common drive motor (16) are so designed 

that, when winding up, the drive speed of the tape drive (9) exceeds that of the tape driving 
mechanism (8) which in turn runs at a greater speed than the drive (6). 
Method as claimed in claims 1 and 2, or 3, or 4, characterized in that, when unwinding, the 
drive speed of drive (6) exceeds that of the tape driving mechanism (8) which in turn runs at a

relative to the frame (23). 
Method as claimed in claims 2, or 3, or 4, characterized in that the drive motor (16) is 
provided with a stepless control facility for adjusting the winding-up speed to the speed of the 

product stream. 
Method as claimed in claims 3 or 4, characterized in that a sheet guide (29) interacts with a 
feed opening of a size slightly larger than the thickness of the product stream (15) entering 

the feeding mechanism which in turn comprises a bottom strand (27) and top strand (28) in 
the intake region of the core (3), to ensure a reliable feed of the product stream (15) to the 

core (3), and also characterized in that the drive is synchronized with the drive of the feed reel 
(7; 36). 
Method as claimed in claims 1 and 2, or 3, or 4, characterized in that the length of winding
