<ABSTRACT>
A low gloss thermoplastic composition with good physical 

properties comprises a polyester, a polyether polyester or blends 
thereof. The thermoplastic composition is blended with a gloss 

reducing amount of a glycidyl (meth)acrylate copolymer to effect the 
desired low gloss properties. The thermoplastic composition may 

also include rubber modified vinyl polymers, as well as additional 
thermoplastic polymers such as polycarbonates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to low-gloss thermoplastic compositions 
comprising polyester resin, copolyether polyester resin, or resin 
blends thereof. More particularly, this invention provides low gloss 
polyester, copolyether polyester, or blends thereof, comprising 
certain glycidyl methacrylate polymers in amounts effective for gloss 
reduction. Molded products are often made from thermoplastic polymers 
(resins) which frequently exhibit glossy surfaces. For some 
purposes, a glossy surface is desirable. However, a matte or non-glossy 
surface is often preferable for products such as housings for 
computer terminals, typewriters, miscellaneous electrical appliances 
and certain automotive parts. Surface embossing is one method which has been practiced to 
reduce or eliminate the surface gloss which is exhibited by polymer 
compositions. Surface embossing, however, requires a separate 
manufacturing step and adds cost to the final product. Moreover, 
subsequent abrasion may remove the embossed surface, thereby 
causing the gloss to reappear. The addition of delustering agents such as finely-divided silica, 
silicate, alumina, or other mineral filler also has been employed to 
reduce surface gloss. Such agents, however, can have a serious 
detrimental effect on the physical properties of the molded article, 
e.g., impact strength. Polymeric delustering agents also frequently 
have deleterious effects on physical properties. The polymeric 
agents not only can detrimentally affect impact strength, but also can  
 
detrimentally affect heat distortion temperature, weathering, and 
light stability. U.S. Pat. No. 4,460,742 describes delustering additives with a 
core-shell rubber structure based on alkyl acrylate-styrene 
copolymers which are partially cross-linked. Low gloss materials have previously been prepared from 
blends of polycarbonates or copolyester carbonates with an 
acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate interpolymer and a gloss-reducing 
amount of glycidyl methacrylate polymer. See U.S. Pat. No. 
4,885,335. These polycarbonate blends, however, do not have the 
solvent resistance and higher melting points of polyesters or 
copolyether polyesters and thus are not appropriate for many 
commercial applications. Moreover, as illustrated later below, 
blends of certain polycarbonates and glycidyl methacrylate 
copolymers still exhibit high gloss surfaces which would be 
unsuitable for certain applications discussed above. Low gloss thermoplastic blends also have been prepared from 
a blend of
