<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions and
methods for treating inflammation and other pathological
conditions mediated by intercellular adhesion. In particular,
it relates to inhibition of cellular adhesion using novel
immunoglobulins reactive with functional epitopes on a cell
surface receptor P-selectin (CD62, granule membrane protein-140
[GMP-140] /platelet activation-dependent granule external
membrane [PADGEM]/LECCAM-3, involved in intercellular adhesion.A specialized cell surface receptor P-selectin, also
known as GMP-140, is involved in the recognition of various
circulating cells by vascular endothelial cells and platelets.
P-selectin is a surface glycoprotein with a lectin-like domain,
a region with homology to epidermal growth factor, and a region
with homology to complement regulatory proteins (see, McEver
Blood Cells 16:73-83 [1990]).The structure of P-selectin is similar to two other
vascular cell surface receptors, endothelial leukocyte adhesion
molecule (ELAM-1) and lymphocyte homing receptor (LHR). The
term "selectin" has been suggested for this general class of
receptors, because of their lectin-like domain and the selective
nature of their adhesive functions.These cell surface receptors are expressed on a
variety of cells. P-selectin is present on the surface of
platelets and endothelial cells in response to a variety of
stimuli, where it mediates platelet-leukocyte and endotheliumleukocyte
interactions. ELAM-1 is expressed only on endothelial
cells and LHR is expressed on a variety of leukocytes in
endothelial venules of peripheral lymph nodes.The role of selectins in inflammation indicates that
compounds capable of inhibiting their action may be useful as
anti-inflammatory agents. Antibodies to P-selectin have been
reported (See e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,783,330, PCT Application 
No. US90/06101, PCT Application No. FR90/00565, and McEver et
al., J. Biol. Chem. 259:9799-9804 [1984]). In addition, an
antibody to P-selectin has been described in presentations at
the Scripps Institute, La Jolla California and at a Keystone
Colloquium held January 16, 1992. Certain of these antibodies
which block P-selectin mediated adhesion are Ca++ dependent.P-selectin is expressed on endothelial cells and on
platelets. Expression of P-selectin is inducible and it is not
expressed on unactivated endothelial cells or platelets. P-selectin
expression does not require denovo synthesis since it
is stored in secretory granules (or Weibel-Palade bodies) in
both platelets and endothelial cells. Thus,
