<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a punch press capable of
carrying out various processing with few tools, and the exchanging of the

cartridges efficiently. The punch frame (2) including the upper and lower
transferring and loading paths (17,18) wherein the upper and lower cartridges (7)

loaded with punch tool and die tool respectively can move-in or move-out freely,
is employed. The ram (38) is employed for driving the punch tool of the upper

cartridge (7). The transferring and loading paths (17,18) are employed wherein the
upper and lower cartridges (7) are capable of being stored and discharged to the

inside and the outside of the press frame (2) independently. The upper and lower
transferring and loading paths (17,18) are capable of storing at least two

cartridges (7) to the front and the back of the moving-in and moving-out
direction. The cartridge transferring and loading means (19,20) are capable of

transferring independently the front and back cartridges (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cartridge-type punch press adopting the
cartridge for the means to support the tool.The cartridge-type punch press freely exchanges the cartridge loaded with
tool in the press frame, and by increasing the number of cartridges to be
prepared, the number of tools capable of being used increases in a great deal.
As a result, various kinds of processing can be carried out.In the cartridge-type punch press, for the cartridge, there are an upper
cartridge loaded with punch tool and a lower cartridge loaded with die tool.
These upper and lower cartridges are always made in a pair, and for example, an
employment to the working position inside the press frame, or a transfer, a
storage into the cartridge magazine can be carried out.Likewise, since the upper and lower cartridges are always handled in a
pair, the punch tool and the die tool to be loaded on these cartridges are
required to be employed as a pair in the cartridge. Therefore, even in the
case the punch tool and the die tool are capable of being used by being
combined to one another, the punch tool and the die tool cannot be combined to
the punch tool and the die tool of the cartridge which is not the other half of 
the pair. As a result, a great number of punch tools and die tools are needed
to be prepared, and the equipment expenses are prone to be high.For example, in the punch processing, the appropriate clearance between the
punch tool and the die tool differs according to the sheet thickness or
material quality. Therefore, when processing the work sheet of various kinds
of sheet thickness or material quality, in the hole processing of the same
radius, a pair of the punch tool and the die tool of which the clearance differs
a little is prepared, and is used separately according to the object. Such
hole processing of the same radius of which the clearance differs, can be
carried out by differentiating either one of the punch tool or the die tool,
and applying the same tool for the other. However, since the upper and lower
cartridges are always handled in a pair, the common use cannot be carried out.
Moreover, the same pair of the punch tool and the die tool to be used frequently
are prepared in a plurality, and when the life ends, the spare pair is made to
be used so that the machine can be kept operating without being stopped, even
when the tool reaches the end of the life as a result of abrasion, for example.
In this case, even if the difference in the length of the life of the punch
tool and the die tool is

<CLAIMS>
A punch press comprising:

a press frame including an upper transferring and loading path and a
lower transferring and loading path wherein a cartridge capable of loading a

punch tool and a cartridge capable of loading the die tool corresponding to the
punch tool, can freely move-in or move-out;
a ram for driving the punch tool loaded on the upper cartridge employed
in the press frame; and
a cartridge transferring and loading means for enabling the storing and
the discharging of the upper and lower cartridges independently to the inside

and outside of the press frame.
The punch press according to claim 1 wherein said upper and lower
transferring and loading paths can store at least two cartridges in the front

and back of the moving-in and moving-out direction, and the cartridge
transferring and loading means can transfer the front and back cartridges

independently.
The punch press according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the cartridge
transferring and loading means transfers the cartridge by the transferring of

the engaging member engaged to the cartridge freely engaging and disengaging
along the transferring and loading path, and the transferring and loading path,

and the transferring path of the engaging and disengaging member are straight
lined path.
