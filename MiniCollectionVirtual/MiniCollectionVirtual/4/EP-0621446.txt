A lamp assembly in which a lampshade is connected with an
adaptor sleeve (14) which encloses a bulb holder, whereby an open

stirrup (15) is constructed having free ends (16, 17) which
engage into a cylinder (34) or the adaptor sleeve (14) by means

of fastening clasps (18, 19), characterised in that recesses
(24', 24, 25, 26) for the fastening clasps (18, 19) on the free

ends (16, 17) of the stirrup component, which is in the form of
a tension-fitted stirrup, are arranged within an inner cylinder

(34) of the adaptor sleeve (14) enclosing the bulb holder and are
matched with the stirrup component ends (16, 17) in such a way

that the bulb holder, which is serewed into the inner threading
(12) by means of its outer thread, locks the ends of the stirrup

within the recesses.
A light assembly according to claim 1, characterised in that
outward-facing angled stirrup ends (16, 17) serve as fastening

clasps (19, 20) which are so constructed as to engage into
reccesses (24', 25) of the adaptor sleeve (14) and that the inner

shanks (21, 22) of the stirrup ends (16, 17) are supported on the
outer cylinder of the bulb holder.
A light assembly according to one of the claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the adaptor sleeve (14) comprises a

cylindrical end (29) which extende via a truncated cone (30),
into an adaptor sleeve body (31) which is provided with an inner

thread (12) and which continues in an outward direction and
serves as a lampshade support (33).
A light assembly according to claim 3, characterised in that,
in diametrical arrangement beneath the truncated cone (30) of the

adaptor sleeve (14) and at the point of contact of the
cylindrical end of the adaptor sleeve, one recess (24' to 26) in

cach case is provided into which a stirrup end (16, 17) then
engages and locks. 
A light assembly according to one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that, for the inner shanks (27, 28) of the

angled pieces (18, 19) of the stirrup ends (16, 17) there are
recesses (25, 26) provided on the inner cylinder (34) of the

adaptor sleeve (14).
A light assembly according to one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the stirrup ends (16, 17) comprise a

profile which is between rectangular and square.
