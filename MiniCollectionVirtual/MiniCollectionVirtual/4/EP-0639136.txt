<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clip attachment 
apparatus of the type for attaching 
U-shaped, metal clips about gathered material. Various mechanisms have been devised for the 
attachment of U-shaped, metal clips about gathered 
material. Typically, such mechanisms include, a frame 
with a clip channel passing vertically through the 
frame. A window is provided for feeding clips one at a 
time into the channel so that the clip may be engaged by 
a reciprocating punch. The punch is operated to drive 
the clips down the channel and against a die to thereby 
form the clip about gathered material positioned in the 
path of the clip. A gate mechanism is typically 
provided to define a portion of one side of the channel. 
The gate mechanism is typically pivotally attached to 
the frame so that the channel may be opened or exposed 
and then gathered material may be placed in the channel 
in the path of a descending clip. Various mechanisms have been suggested for 
operation of the gate. For example, US-A-3,543,378 
discloses opposed sliding plates or gate members which 
are spaced one from the other for insertion of material 
to be clipped. The gate members then slidably approach 
one another to compress and form the material. A clip 
is then driven down a channel defined in one of the gate 
members for forming about the gathered material. US-A-4,109,363 
discloses yet another gate mechanism. In this 
document a gate is pivotally mounted on the frame and is 
connected by a linkage to the drive piston which also 
operates the punch for driving the clip. The linkage 
ensures that the gate will be rotated to a closed 
position to form the channel before a clip is driven 
down the channel against a die. Conversely, when the  
 
punch has been retracted from engagement with a clip, 
the gate is swung open to reveal a throat for receipt of 
gathered material. US-A-4,675,945 discloses a pivotal or movable gate 
which pivots out of position to expose a throat for 
receipt of gathered material. The gate is pivoted by 
actuation of a separate control cylinder unassociated 
with the cylinder for driving the punch. Us-A-3,783,583 
also discloses a gate mechanism which is associated with 
a separate cylinder actuator and which opens when the 
cylinder is in a retracted position and is closed to 
form the channel and gather material when the cylinder 
is in its extended position. US-A-4,766,713 also 
discloses a gate mechanism which pivots in response to 
cylinder actuation. In US-A-4,993,135 there is 
disclosed a gate

<CLAIMS>
Clip attachment apparatus of the type 
including a support frame (10), a clip channel (16) for 

receipt of a U-shaped metal clip, a window (65) for 
feeding a clip into the channel, a die (66) for forming 

the clip about gathered material, said die positioned at 
the end of the channel, a punch (14) for driving a clip 

in the channel against the die, at least one gate 
member (40,44) pivotally attached to the frame, said 

gate member forming a part of the channel when pivoted 
to a closed position and defining a throat for receipt 

of gathered material when pivoted to an open position, 
and a gate driving means (50,54,84,86) for reciprocating 

the gate member between the open and closed positions, 
characterized in that said apparatus further comprises: 


said gate driving means including a follower yoke (50,54) linked to the gate member; 
an eccentric (84,86) cooperatively engaging the 
yoke and defining a cam for driving the yoke as a 

follower, said eccentric mounted for rotation on the 
frame; and 
means (88,90) for rotating the eccentric to drive 
the yoke and the gate member from a fully open position 

to a fully closed position, said eccentric and yoke 
cooperative to impart substantially no rotational 

velocity to the gate member in the fully open and fully 
closed positions. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, comprising 
first and second gate members (40,44) one of said gate 

members (44) supporting the die (66) and one side of the 
channel (16), the other gate member (40) supporting the 

other side of the channel. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
other gate member (40) includes a cutting knife (94) 

which may be actuated to sever material gathered by the  
 

gate members (40,44). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein the yoke (50,54) comprises a cylindrical 

follower and the eccentric (84,86) comprises a circular 
cam rotatable about an eccentric rotational axis. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim 
including stops (112,114,116) to limit the relative 

rotation of the yoke (50,54) and eccentric (84,86). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim 
including a rotary actuator for the eccentric (84,86). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6 including 
means (12) for driving the punch and including 

independent means (101) for driving the actuator 
(58,60).
