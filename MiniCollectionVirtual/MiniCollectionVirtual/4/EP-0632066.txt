<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to copolymers of ethylene with propylene, optionally with a minor amount of polyenes,
and to the process for their preparation.Copolymers of ethylene with one or more α-olefins and optionally a minor amount of polyenes are known which,
after vulcanisation exhibit elastomeric type properties. The most common of these are copolymers of ethylene with propylene
(EPR), which can contain small amounts of a non-conjugated diene monomer (EPDM).Thanks to their good resistance to high temperatures, chemical and atmospheric agents, and their dielectric properties,
these elastomers find uses in various application fields. Principally they can be used as additives for lubricating
oils, covering materials in building, electric insulators, components in the automotive industry or modifiers in mixtures
with thermoplastic polymers.The above mentioned ethylene copolymers are generally prepared in the presence of Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The
copolymers so obtained have a high tendency to produce blocks of propylenic units in the chain, and this gives rise to
crystallinity negatively influencing the final characteristic of the product. Therefore, in order to obtain vulcanised copolymers
which are endowed with good elastomeric properties, it is important that the distribution of the propylenic units
within the chain is as homogenous as possible.More recently, these ethylene copolymers have been prepared in the presence of homogeneous catalysts obtained
from metallocenes and aluminoxane compounds.U.S. Patent No. 5,001,205, for example, describes a process for the preparation of elastomeric copolymers of ethylene
with an α-olefin, particularly with propylene, in which the product obtained from the reaction of methylaluminoxane
(MAO) with a bis cyclopentadiene of Zr, Ti, or Hf, such as bis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride, ethylene- bis
(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride, or dimethylsilandiyl-bis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride is used as a catalyst.The homogeneity of the distribution of the propylenic units in the copolymer that is obtained operating in the presence
of these types of catalyst, although turning out improved with respect to the copolymers obtained from Ziegler-Natta
catalysts, is still not totally satisfactory.In Makromol. Chem Rapid Commun. 14, 109-114 (1993) are disclosed ethylene/ propylene copolymers obtained
by polymerizing ethylene and propylene in the presence of a catalyst system comprising rac-ethylenebis (indenyl) ethyl-zirconium
species or in the
