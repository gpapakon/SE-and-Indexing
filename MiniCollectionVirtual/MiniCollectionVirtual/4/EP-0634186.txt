<ABSTRACT>
A combination mouth and nasal mask (40) for assisted respiration 
or CPAP is disclosed. 
The combination mask (40) has a frame (42) to the rear side of 
which is mounted a separate nasal cushion (44) and mouth cushion (46). 

Both the nasal cushion (44) and the mouth cushion (46) separately form 
a rolled edge seal around the patient's face in the vicinity of the 

nose and in the vicinity of the lips. Inlet air is communicated from 
within the housing (48) to the mouth chamber, circumscribed by the 

mouth cushion (46) by means of one or more interconnecting tubes (62). 
The proportion of air communicated to the mouth chamber (48) is 
controlled by the sizing and number of the tube(s), thus providing for 

free flow of air, restricted flow of air and pressure equalisation, or 
zero flow of air. 
A mouth mask (10) for assisted respiration or CPAP also is 
disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The delivery of pressurised air or gas to the respiratory system
of a patient is a requirement in several widely accepted medical
treatments. These treatments include continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) for people suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
and other breathing disorders during sleep, and for ventilation for
people with various neuromuscular disorders that impede breathing.
CPAP is also used in the treatment of lung disorders and in intensive
care hospital use.A description of CPAP treatment can be obtained from Australian
Patent No. 560360.It has become increasingly popular to apply pressurised air or
gas to the respiratory system through a nasal mask or nasal cannulae,
in preference to a full face mask, although the passage of gas or air
by the mouth would be a useful alternative in some circumstances. The
increase in popularity of nasal masks is partly due to the ability to
obtain a relatively airtight seal with a nasal mask, as less of the
face has to be covered than with a full face mask, and there is less
relative movement around the nose than around the mouth where the mouth
can open and the lower jaw droop. An example of a nasal mask, and cf
nasal CPAP treatment, is disclosed in published Australian Application
No. 77110/91.Whilst the majority of patients who regularly use nasal CPAP when
sleeping tolerate the nose mask quite well, there is a substantial
minority who experience significant mouth leaks. There are other
patients who are inveterate mouth breathers and for whom nasal CPAP
simply is ineffective. These patients require CPAP treatment via the
mouth in addition to, or instead of, the nose.Mouth leaks may be partially a function of the treatment
pressure, and may also relate to mouth and throat anatomical features
of patients. Mouth leaks are undesirable for a number of reasons.
They reduce the effect of pressure that is available to drive air into
the lungs or to splint open the upper airway at the site of
obstruction. This means that higher pressures have to be applied at 
the nose mask to compensate for the leak for the treatment to be
effective. Mouth leaks also place an increased load on the nasal
passages in drying the mucosal surfaces in the presence of a biased
one-way flow, with some of the air entering through the nose passing
straight out of the mouth. This can lead to unpleasant side effects
including nasal obstruction, or a condition ranging from a runny to dry
and stuffy nose and mouth after several hours of use. These side
effects are often so

<CLAIMS>
A combination mouth and nose mask for use in ventilation or CPAP
of the nose and mouth of a patient, the mask (40) comprises a separate nasal

cushion (44) and mouth cushion (46), the nasal cushion shaped to form a rolled edge
seal circumscribing a region surrounding the patient's nose, the mouth cushion (46)

shaped to form a rolled edge seal circumscribing a region surrounding the patient's lips,
the nasal cushion (44) defining a nasal air supply chamber (52) and the mouth cushion

defining a mouth air supply chamber (54), the said nasal and mouth air supply
chambers (52,54) being commonly in fluid communication, and further in fluid

communication with an inlet supply (50) of pressurised air or gas, and expiration means
(30), and wherein the mask (40) is operable to supply pressurised air or gas for

inspiration by the inlet (50) to the said nasal and mouth chambers (52,54), and the
expiration means (30) provides for expiration by a route of either the mouth chamber

(54) in fluid communication with the nasal chamber (52), or by both chambers (54,52)
directly.
A combination nose and mouth mask as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the chambers (52,54) are interconnected by communication means (57,59,62,64) is

sized either to allow the free passage of inlet air between the two chambers (52,54) or
to allow only enough air to pass to the mouth chamber (54) as would be required for

pressure equalisation of the mouth chamber (54) in the absence of breathing through the
mouth.
A combination mouth and nose mask as claimed in claim 2, wherein
the communication means is either a duct (57) or one or more tubes (62). 
A combination mouth and nose mask as claimed in claim 3, wherein
the nasal cushion (44) and the mouth cushion (46) are carried on separate body

portions.
A combination mouth and nose mask as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the mouth cushion (46) is shaped to seal the patient's mouth

such that expiration
is provided only from the nasal chamber (52).
A combination nose and mouth mask as claimed in any preceding claim, further
comprising a safety valve (80), the safety valve including a stretchable membrane (82)

formed within a valve chamber (84), said valve chamber (84) having one or more
openings (86) to allow free passage of air from the atmosphere and an exiting opening

(88) in fluid communication with said mouth chamber (54), said membrane (82) being
in fluid communication with a port means (90) which, in use, is in fluid communication

with a source of air or gas, and the pressure of air or gas at said port means (90) being
greater than the pressure in said valve chamber (84), whereby said membrane (82) is

elastically displaced to seal said exiting opening (88), and further operable to open said
exiting opening (88) to a flow of air from the atmosphere by elastic restoration when

the pressure at said port means (90) and the pressure in said valve chamber (84) both
fall to or below atmospheric pressure. 
A combination nose and mouth mask as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein each of said nasal cushion (44) and said mouth cushion (46)

have a first region constructed of a material having a thickness that enables ready
deformation, and a second region constructed of the same material as said first region

but having a thickness that is resilient to avoid collapse of each respective said cushion
in the absence of supplied pressurized air.
A combination nose and mouth mask as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, further comprising attachment means for releasably fastening the

mask to a patient's head.
A system for administering CPAP treatment comprising:

a motor driven pump;
means for controlling the delivery pressure of pressurised gas or air supplied

thereby;
a delivery pipe (50) for delivery of pressurised gas or air from the pump; and
characterised by
a combination mouth and nose mask (40) as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8.
