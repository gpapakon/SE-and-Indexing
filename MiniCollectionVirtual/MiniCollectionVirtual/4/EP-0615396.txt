<ABSTRACT>
Method for the realization of the so-called "seamless 
handover", that is the time slot change without solution of 

continuity in the vocal signal in a digital private 
cordless telephony system, in particular in the DECT 

system. 
The radio fixed part for the implementation of this 
method provides for the use of a digital signal processor 

(DSP) comprising as many ring buffers (RB) as the number of 
time slots of the DECT half frame. These ring buffers (RB) 

contain in any moment the ADPCM samples relative to 10 msec 
of the vocal signal, where each sample is written 

cancelling the oldest previous sample so that in any moment 
each one of the ring buffers (RB) contains the most recent 

samples.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
realization of the so-called "seamless handover", that is 
the time slot change without solution of continuity in the 
vocal signal in a digital system of private or cordless 
telephony. The invention will be preferably applied in the 
system known as DECT (Digital European Cordless Telephone). The systems of private telephony comprise a plurality 
of radio fixed parts in order to cover the interested area 
and connected to a switching network which may be the 
public one or a so-called PAXB, and portable subscriber 
parts able to be connected to the radio fixed parts through 
a radio link, and therefore the portable parts are able to 
communicate with each other and with other fixed subscriber 
equipments connected to the public telephone network. The 
connections may be of the vocal type or they may allow the 
exchange of data occupying the equivalent of one or more 
vocal "channels". The area covered by a base station or cell is 
generally rather reduced covering sometimes just the radius 
of some tens or hundreds of meters. Typical application of 
cordless telephony systems can be found in industrial 
plants where they may replace the installation of a wired 
network, in commercial or urban centres where they may 
advantageously replace public telephone boxes, and others 
more. The telecommunication network for the cordless 
telephony is a digital one. The radio access belongs to the 
category FDMA - TDMA - TDD. The system is a TDD one as the transmission and the 
reception do not occur simultaneously. More exactly, as  
 
illustrated in figure 1, the basic frame of 10 milliseconds 
is divided in two halves, and during the first 5 ms the 
base station emits and the portable phones receive a half 
frame (half frame TX DECT) , and in the following 5 ms 
occurs the contrary (half frame RX DECT). Each half frame 
is set up by 12 channels (1, 2,..., 12) or time slots 
(TDMA), each one of which is set up by 420 (or according to 
the cases by 424) bits. The channels are transmitted or 
received using 10 different frequencies (FDMA) for a total 
of 120 channels available to the system, which are 
naturally reassigned to cells sufficiently distant one from 
the other in order not to create any interference problems. 
Each time slot is subdivided in a synchronism field S of 32 
bits, in a field A of 8 + 40 bits with relative 16 control 
bits, and in a field B of 320 bits where the bits are 
allocated which are obtained by coding the vocal samples of 
a

Method for the seamless handover in a cordless DECT 
system wherein the vocal samples of each one of the active 

subscribers are codified on four bits and inserted in an 
ADPCM frame in order to be grouped and transferred into 

corresponding time slots of a half frame DECT and vice 
versa, characterized by the following steps: 


memorising, for each one of the active channels of the 
DECT half frame in at least one corresponding ring buffer a 

sequence of four bits samples relative to 10 msec. of vocal 
signal, where each sample is written cancelling the 

previous older sample so that always the most recent 
samples are contained in each one of the ring buffers; 
linking, in the absence of a handover request, to each 
ring buffer a first time slot of the DECT half frame 

commanding therefore the transfer of the content of each 
memory to the interested subscriber at the moment defined 

by the synchronism pulse of said first DECT slot; 
linking, in the presence of a handover request related 
to a generic channel, to the ring buffer corresponding to 

that channel either said first time slot or a second time 
slot of the DECT half frame commanding so the transfer of 

the content of the relative ring buffer to the subscriber 
having started off the handover procedure in correspondence 

to the synchronism pulse of the first or second time slot 
of the DECT half frame. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
in presence of a handover request the vocal samples of the 

ADPCM frame related to the subscriber interested by said 
request are grouped in a first and in a second ring buffer 

and the interested subscriber receives the samples 
allocated in the second ring buffer in correspondence of 

the synchronism pulse of the second channel of the DECT 
half frame. 
Radio fixed part for the seamless handover in 
a cordless DECT system wherein the vocal samples of each 

active subscriber are codified on four bits and inserted in 
a ADPCM frame for being grouped and transferred into the 

available time slots of a transmission half frame DECT, 
characterized in that it comprises: 


an analog/digital converter (A/D) suitable to convert 
a line code (HDB3) into binary signals; 
a PCM signal reception unit (PCM_D) connected to the 
output of the analog/digital converter (A/D) and suitable 

to render available: 

i) on a first output the data allocated in the ADPCM 
frame; 
ii) on a second output a synchronous clock with the 
above-mentioned data; 
iii) on a third output a synchronism pulse defining 
the beginning of the ADPCM frame; 
a digital signal processor (DSP) connected to said PCM 
signal reception unit (PCM_D); 
a radio frequency unit (RF) connected to said 
processor (DSP) and to an antenna (A); 
a PCM signal transmission unit (PCM_U) connected to 
said second and third output of the PCM signal reception 

unit (PCM_D) as well as to said processor (DSP); 
a digital/analog converter (D/A) suitable to convert 
the digital signals available at the output of the PCM 

signal transmission unit in a line code (HDB3). 
Radio fixed part according to claim 3, 
characterized in that said processor (DSP) comprises as 

many ring buffers (RB1, ..., RB12) as the numbers of time 
slot contained in a DECT half frame, these ring buffers 

being suitable to memorize a sequence of four bits samples 
corresponding to 10 msec of vocal signal, where each sample 

being written cancelling the preceding older sample so that 
at any moment there are the most recent samples are 

contained in each one of the ring buffer,
 

   characterized moreover in that said ring buffers (RB) 
are, in absence of a handover request, linked to at least 

one first time slot of the DECT half frame, and they are 
read at the moment defined by the synchronism pulse (S) of 

the channel linked to them, 
   characterized further in that, in presence of a 

handover request relative to a generic time slot, said ring 
buffers (RB) are linked either to said first time slot of 

the DECT half frame and to a second time slot always of the 
DECT half frame, commanding so the transfer of the content 

of the relative ring buffer to the subscriber having 
started off the handover procedure in correspondence of the 

synchronism pulse of said first or second time slot. 
Radio fixed part according to claim 4, 
characterized in that in presence of a handover request the 

vocal samples of the ADPCM frame related to the subscriber 
interested by such request are grouped in a first and in a 

second ring buffer (RB), and the interested subscriber
