<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a substrate structure with 
improved heat dissipation is provided. A semiconductor 

wafer (14) is provided. A diamond layer (12) is formed 
on the back (20) of the wafer (14). The diamond layer 

(12) provides structural support and heat dissipation. 
In certain embodiments, the diamond layer may be an 

amorphous diamond substrate (12) bonded to the 
semiconductor wafer (14). In certain other embodiments 

the diamond layer (12) may be a thin film layer (12) 
deposited on the back of the semiconductor wafer (14). 

The semiconductor wafer (14) is thinned to a minimum 
thickness necessary for forming an electronic device in a 

surface (22) of the wafer (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to
substrate structures, and more particularly, to substrate
structures having improved heat dissipation capabilities.Conventionally, electronic solid-state devices are
formed in semiconductor substrates such as disk-shaped
silicon wafers. Typically, many identical devices are
formed in the surface of a wafer. After the devices are
formed, the wafer is typically cut into individual die,
each die comprising a single device.Modern applications for the solid-state devices
formed in wafers require increasingly higher power
devices. For example, applications in telecommunications
require high power radio frequency amplifiers.
Additionally, as digital microprocessors become more
complex they require higher power.The higher power of the modern devices directly
results in an increase in the creation of heat during the
operation of the devices. The heat created by the
devices must be dissipated in order for the devices to
maintain acceptable operating temperatures.A typical approach to dissipating heat from a
semiconductor device is attachment to a heat sink which
can efficiently conduct heat away from the device.
Common heat sinks comprise metal such as copper, which is
naturally a good heat conductor. Unfortunately, the
typical semiconductor device will not operate properly if
an electrical conducting material such as copper is
directly attached to it. Consequently, in the past, 
individual die comprising individual semiconductor devices have been
attached to ceramic substrates which are then attached to a metal heat sink.
The ceramic substrate provides electrical isolation (insulation) between the
semiconductor device and the metal heat sink. Unfortunately, the ceramic
substrates are not particularly efficient in conducting heat away from the
semiconductor device to the heat sink.An additional approach which has been taken is to thin the
semiconductor substrate in which the electronic device is formed in order to
minimize the amount of semiconductor material through which the heat must
pass, since the heat is generated at the surface of the substrate where the
device is formed. The thinned substrate may then be separated into
individual die and attached to ceramic insulators and heat sinks as discussed
above. Unfortunately, the substrates can not be thinned as much as desirable
because they become subject to breaking during further processing.Another approach to dissipating heat from a semiconductor device is
described in IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and
