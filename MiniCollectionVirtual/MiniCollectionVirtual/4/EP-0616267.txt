oscillating voltage, Vf (Hz) is the frequency of the 

oscillating voltage, Vcont (V) is a potential 
difference between a voltage of a DC component of the 

oscillating voltage and a potential of an image 
portion on the image bearing member when a maximum 

image density is provided, Q (c/kg) is an average 
triboelectric charge amount of the toner particles,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
forming apparatus such as a copying machine, printer
or the like, more particularly to an image forming
apparatus in which an electrostatic latent image is
formed on a photosensitive member by selective
actuation of the laser beam.Recently, digital image formation are noted
in the field of a copying machine or printer as a
result of demand for full-color image or systematic
arrangement. For example, a laser beam printer has
been widely used in which a latent image bearing
member is scanned with a laser beam, and a desired
image is formed in the latent image bearing member in
the form of a photosensitive drum or the like by
selective actuation of the laser beam.The typical usage of such laser beam printers
are for binary level recording of characters, graphics
or the like. In this case, the recording of dots,
characters, graphics or the like does not require
halftone level recording, and therefore, the structure
of the printer is simple.On the other hand, a printer capable of 
forming tone images is also known. Such a
printer uses a dither method, a density pattern method
or the like . However, as is well known, a
high resolution image can not be obtained using the
dithering method or the density pattern method.Under the circumstances, a proposal has been
made recently in which a halftone level dot is formed
for each pixel without reducing the high recording
density. This is done by modulating a pulse width
(PWM) of the laser beam in accordance with the image
signal. Using this method, high resolution and high
tone reproduction image can be produced.However, in a halftone region having a
reflection density of not more than 0.3 in such an
apparatus, roughness or white stripes appear in the
image. The defects are not so notable in the case of
characters, but they are much notable in a low density
region in the case of photographic image or the like.The investigations have been made as to the
causes of the roughness.In the case of using two component developer:When a high light portion latent image is
formed by latent image dots, the latent image on the
photosensitive member is not a broad image as in
analog latent image, if it is seen microscopically,
but it is rather local images. If the density is
further reduced, the latent image becomes dull because 
of the influence of the film thickness of the
photosensitive member with the result of gradual
decrease of the maximum contrast potential V0, as
shown in Figure 5. For example, if an attempt is made
to reproduce an
