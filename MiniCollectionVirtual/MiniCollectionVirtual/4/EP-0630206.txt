<ABSTRACT>
A neurological pin comprises a shaft (2) formed with a sphere (4) at one end and a point (6) at the other. The point (6) is partially protected by an enlarged section (8) which has an annular surface (10) in a plane which traverses the shaft axis, and from which the point (6) will normally project.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to neurological pins. They
are used for testing objective sensation; for example,
awareness of the difference between sharp (pain) and
blunt by comparison between a sharp point and a rounded
end on the patient's skin.Normally, the sharp point and rounded element of a
neurological pin are provided at opposite ends of a
shaft or handle. However, U.S.-A-4,865,045 discloses a
different arrangement in which both components are
provided at the same end of a handle. This enables the
other end of the handle to serve a different purpose,
and in this prior specification this other end is
fashioned to form a shoehorn.The most commonly used neurological pin consists of
a relatively narrow rod, of which one end is sharpened
to provide the point, and the other end carriers a
spherical body for providing the rounded end for blunt
sensation. It is used by grasping it between thumb and
forefinger, pincer like, halfway between its two ends
and applying one or the other to the patient's, asking
the patient, whose eyes are closed or at least is not
watching, to identify which end is being used. The
clinician's hand has to invert or switch the pin through
180Â° to change ends. Pressure is applied manually and
may vary. Although not as sharp as a needle, the sharp
end of the pin is still easily capable of penetrating
skin, especially in the hands of the inexperienced, the
fatigued or the over zealous.The traditional neurological pin has been looked
upon as a permanent piece of equipment, traditionally to
be found in the lapel of the hospital doctor's coat and
the consultant's jacket or in the family doctor's bag.
It would be used from patient to patient as the hospital
practitioner moves form bed to bed, or as the GP moves
from house to house. The pin is placed back in its
place of storage with as much afterthought as the
stethoscope. It may be used by the practitioner on 
multiple occasions in one day. There are obvious risks
involved in such multiple utilisation of the same piece
of equipment. The multiple use of an item which can
potentially puncture the skin involves a particular risk
of cross-infection. The present invention is directed at a neurological
pin, broadly of the traditional type as described above,
but adapted to minimise the risk of the patients' skin
being puncture during its use. According to the
invention, a neurological pin comprises a shaft with a
sharp end and a blunt end wherein the sharp end is
surrounded by an element defining an annular surface
traversing the axis of the

<CLAIMS>
A neurological pin comprising a shaft (2) with a
sharp end (6) and a blunt end (4), both for testing objective

sensation, wherein the sharp end (6) is surrounded by an
element (8) defining an annular surface (10) traversing the axis

of the shaft (2), which element (8) determines the extent to
which the sharp end (6) can impress the skin of a patient

under a given force.
A neurological pin according to Claim 1
wherein the annular surface (10) defines a plane

substantially containing the point at the sharp end (6) of
the shaft (2).
A neurological pin according to Claim 1
wherein the annular surface defines a plane from which

the sharp end (6) of the shaft (2) projects.
A neurological pin according to Claim 3
wherein the annular surface (10) is substantially circular,

and the sharp end (6) projects beyond the plane of the
annulus by a distance not exceeding the radius thereof.
A pin according to Claim 3 or Claim 4 wherein
the annular surface (10) is the boundary of a substantially

planar surface perpendicular to the shaft (2) and from which
the sharp end (6) of the shaft projects.
A neurological pin according to Claim 1
wherein the annular surface (10) defines a plane traversing

the axis of the shaft (2) beyond the sharp end thereof.
A neurological pin according to any preceding
Claim wherein the surrounding element (8) is substantially

rigid.
A neurological pin according to any preceding
Claim wherein the surrounding element (8) is fixed to the

shaft.
A neurological pin according to Claim 8
wherein the surrounding element (8) is formed integral with

the shaft. 
A neurological pin according to any of Claims
1 to 7 wherein the surrounding element (8) is mounted on the

shaft (2) for axial movement therealong.
A neurological pin according to any preceding
Claim wherein the surrounding element (8) is substantially

conical, and convergent towards the blunt end (4) of the
shaft.
A neurological pin according to any preceding
Claim wherein the blunt end (4) of the shaft comprises a

spherical body.
A neurological pin according to any preceding
Claim wherein the tip at the sharp end of the shaft

defines a substantially flat surface (24) traversing the
shaft axis.
A neurological pin according to Claim 13
wherein the shape of the flat surface (24) is square.
A neurological pin according to any preceding
Claim moulded in a plastics material.
