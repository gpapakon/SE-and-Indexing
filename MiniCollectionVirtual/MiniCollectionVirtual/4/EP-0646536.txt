<ABSTRACT>
A method of winding coils of filamentary material in a 
figure-8 configuration with a radially positioned payout hole of 

uniform width or diameter, thereby reducing or eliminating "valleys" 
and the accompanying "lumpiness" of wound coils. In one embodiment 

of the invention, sensors control the size of the payout hole. In a 
modified embodiment of the invention, the sensors are mounted to be 

moved in conjunction with the increase in the diameter of the coil 
as it is being wound. In a third embodiment of the invention, and 

one that is adapted to the use of microprocessor control of the 
winding operation, the location and size of the payout hole is 

calculated and the proper winding parameters to control the winding 
process are programmed into the memory of the microprocessor with 

provision for entry of key variables by means of a key pad, 
thumbwheel switches or a key board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the winding of filamentary
material in a figure 8 configuration with a radial payout hole
extending from the inside to the outside of the wind, and more
particularly to such winding in which a uniform radial payout hole
is produced regardless of the diameter or thickness of the wind.Method and apparatus for producing a figure 8 wind with a
radial payout hole extending through the wall of the wind is
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,406,419, entitled: "Method and
Apparatus for Winding Flexible Material" and assigned to the same
assignee as the subject application.
This document represents the closest prior art.
The winding techniques
disclosed in the the aforesaid patent are used by the assignee,
Windings, Inc., along with other winding techniques, to produce
winds of the aforementioned kind in accordance with the REELEX
system, which is licensed in the United States and foreign
countries.In accordance with the currently used REELEX system a
coil of filamentary material is wound on a mandrel 20 having a
radius r2, and with a radial payout hole 22 in the form of a wedge
of essentially constant angle A along the radius of the wind 24, as
shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that the generation of a payout hole
22 using a constant angle A results in an increasing circumferential
distance in direct proportion to the radius of the wind. This 
difference in circumferential distance is evident from a
consideration of a wind having a radius r1 which results in the
distance B being subtended as ,for example, the radius r2 of the
mandrel itelf (in effect a zero radius wind) which subtends a
distance C. Thus if the coil is wound with an initial size of the
payout hole 22 equal to allow a payout tube to be inserted therein
after the wind is completed, it is apparent that the size of the
payout hole 22 will be too large when the wind is finished with a
radius of r1. It is therefore desirable to provide a technique for
modifying or adjusting the size of the payout hole during the
winding of a coil, and especially for larger diameter coils where
the inner and outer size of the payout holes have greater disparity
(for example, compare distances B and C of Fig. 1).The problems caused by such a payout hole are as follows:
(1) When producing coils in accordance with the REELEX system,
a "valley" is generated where there are no crossovers. This causes
the coil to become lumpy due to the varying densities of the wound
filamentary material. The valleys extend outwardly from the payout
hole, around the
