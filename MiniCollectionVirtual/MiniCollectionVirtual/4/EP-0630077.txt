<ABSTRACT>
A grounding spring clip for modular jacks includes a 
stamped or etched plate having an opening substantially 

coextensive with the plug receiving opening in a modular jack 
and a bent tab to provide at least one springy finger 

extending out from the plate adjacent the opening and 
partially occluding the opening. Two opposite edges of the 

plate are bent backward to provide curls which wrap around 
corresponding edges of the face plate of a snap- in modular 

jack. One edge of the plate is bent to provide a tab stop and 
the edge opposite the tab stop is left straight. The 

grounding spring clip is slid onto the face plate of a snap-in 
modular jack before the jack is mounted in a chassis panel. 

When the jack is snapped into the chassis panel, the curled 
edges of the spring clip are biased between the face plate of 

the jack and the surface of the chassis panel thereby making a 
good electrical connection with the chassis. When a shielded 

modular plug is inserted into the jack, the springy finger 
adjacent the opening in the spring clip engages the outer 

sheath of the plug thereby making a good electrical connection 
with the shielding of the shielded cable carrying the plug. 

The integrity of the coupling is easily visually inspected and 
the spring clip can be quickly and inexpensively replaced if 

necessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to modular jacks such as 
those commonly used in telecommunications and computer 
networking. More particularly, this invention relates to a 
spring clip attachable to a snap-in panel modular jack where 
the spring clip provides the jack with a grounded shield for 
electromagnetic interference (EMI) isolation adn suppression 
when used with a shielded modular plug. Modular plugs and jacks are widely used in 
telecommunications. In recent years they have also been used 
extensively in computer networking. These plugs and jacks are 
durable, reliable, and are inexpensive to manufacture with 
copper conductors held inside a molded plastic body. The 
jacks usually include a rectangular opening with at least one 
upper keyway. A plurality of springy copper "finger" contacts 
extend upward and rearward from the bottom side of the jack 
into the rectangular opening. A plug having a rectangular 
cross section, lower surface contacts bounded in channels and 
an upper springy key lock is insertable into the jack. The 
upper springy key lock on the plug engages the upper keyway in 
the jack while the lower surface contacts on the plug are 
engaged by the springy finger contacts in the jack which are 
maintained in proper alignment by the channels in the plug. 
When the plug is fully inserted into the jack, the upper 
springy key lock snaps into a locking position with the upper 
keyway of the back. The upper springy lock of the plug 
extends outside the jack so that it can be pressed down 
against the plug to disengage the key lock from the keyway to 
permit the plug to be removed from the jack.  Prior art Figures 1a - 1d show side elevation views of 
the open plug receiving end of four slightly different modular 
jacks such as those supplied by AW Industries, Inc., 6788 NW 
17th Avenue, Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33309. Each of the jacks has 
a face plate 5 with a generally rectangular opening 10, an 
upper keyway 12 and a plurality of finger contacts 14. The 
number of finger contacts, the size of the rectangular opening 
and the number of keyways may vary according to different 
applications, but all of these jacks have the same general 
configuration as described above. Beyond the face plate 5, 
these jacks assume a substantially cubic or box-like shape and 
are provided with electrical edge card contacts 16 (Figure 2a) 
at a rear portion for coupling the contacts with the gold 
plated fingersof a printed circuit board. Prior art Figures 2a - 2c show rear, top and side views 
of a

A grounding coupling for use with a modular jack to couple 
the conductive sheath of a shielded modular plug with an 

electrical ground, the modular jack having a plug receiving 
opening, said coupling comprising: 


a) jack engaging means embracing at least a portion of an outer 
surface of the modular jack; 
b) conductive plug engaging means coupled to said jack engaging 
means and extending from said jack engaging means in a direction 

which does not enter the plug receiving opening when said 
coupling is attached to the jack and such that when the shielded 

plug is inserted into the jack, the plug engaging means makes a 
biased contact with the conductive sheath of the plug; and 
c) ground connecting means electrically coupled to said jack 
engaging means and electrically coupled to electrical ground. 
A grounding coupling according to claim 1 where the jack is a 
snap-in panel mounted jack having a face plate with a lip, 

wherein: 
   said jack engaging means comprises an electrically 

conductive plate with an opposed pair of bent edges, said bent 
edges embracing the lip of the face plate. 
A grounding coupling according to claim 2 where the shielded 
modular plug is coupled to a grounded chassis panel, wherein; 

   said ground connecting means comprises an end of at least 
one of said bent edges which resides between the face plate lip 

and the grounded chassis panel when the snap-in panel mounted 
jack is snapped-in the grounded chassis panel.
