An electrode consisting of an electrically
conductive core essentially comprising iron and an

electrically conductive single-layer coating comprising
lead and from 0.3 to 3.5% by weight of copper and, if

required, further elements selected from the group
consisting of silver, selenium, tellurium, bismuth and

antimony.

electrode as claimed in claim 1 or 2 which is connected

as the cathode.
A process for the production of an electrode as
claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the electrically

conductive coating is applied to the electrically conductive
core by electroplating or by a physical deposition

method selected from the group consisting of vapor
deposition, sputtering and arc coating.
A process for the reductive coupling of olefinic
reactants by electrohydrodimerization in a conventional
