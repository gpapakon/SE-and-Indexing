<DESCRIPTION>
This application discloses a linear methacrylic ABC 
triblock polymer, having at least one hydrophobic block 
and one hydrophilic block, in which the composition of 
each of the three blocks is different. A variety of ABC triblock polymers, in which the 
chemical constitution of each polymeric block differs 
from the other two, have been described in the 
literature. Generally, they have been prepared by 
anionic polymerization. The ABC triblock polymers of 
the art have been found to be useful as elastomeric 
materials, for example in design of automobile bumpers. 
Some of these ABC triblock polymers contain a 
hydrophilic block but, of these, none are prepared 
exclusively with methacrylates. Int. Application No. PCT/Fr90/00514, published on 
January 24, 1991 as WO 91/00874 (same as European Patent 
Application EP 408429, January 16, 1991), discloses 
triblock ABC copolymers wherein A and C can be an 
acrylic, vinyl aromatic, methacrylic, or maleimide 
block, where B is an acrylic, vinyl aromatic or 
methacrylic block, and where at least one of A and C is 
selected from a different class from that of the B 
block. Thus, all three blocks cannot be methacrylic. U.S. 4,417,034, which is incorporated herein by 
reference, covers the GTP process of preparing block 
polymers generically; the composition claim is to 
"living" (silyl ketene acetal-ended) polymers, not the 
"quenched" block polymers of this invention.
