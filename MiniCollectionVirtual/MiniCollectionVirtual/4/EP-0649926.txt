<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for continuously pressing, decatising and fixing sheet-like textile material, such as woven or knitted fabric or the like, a pressure band being guided over a heated effect roller and deflecting rollers, in such a way that it loops round a part of the circumference of the effect roller, and, in this region, pressure forces are exerted on the textile material guided between it and the effect roller. The object on which the invention is based is, in devices for continuously pressing, decatising and fixing sheet-like textile material, to provide constructive measures which bring about an increase in the life of the pressure band and, at the same time, reduce the investment costs for devices of this type. This object is achieved, according to the invention, in that, in order to apply the necessary pressure forces to the textile material (6), the effect roller (4) and/or at least one of the deflecting rollers (2, 3), necessary in any case, can be pressed against the pressure band (1) by means of a tension device (5).

Apparatus for the continuous pressing, decatizing
and setting of web-like textile material (6), such as

woven or knitted fabric or the like, a pressure band (1)
being led over a heated effect roller (4) and over

deflecting rollers, in such a way that the said pressure
band loops round part of the circumference of the effect

roller (4), and a tension device (5) being provided for
tensioning the pressure band (1), so that pressure forces

are exerted on the textile material (6) led between the
pressure band (1) and the effect roller (4), characterized

in that the pressure band (1) is led over an
effect roller (4) and two deflecting rollers (2, 3) which

have a substantially larger diameter than the effect
roller (4) which is arranged between the deflecting

rollers (2, 3) within their diametral range, the effect
roller (4) or one of the deflecting rollers (2, 3) being

displaceable by means of the tension device (5) for
tensioning the pressure band (1).
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the diameter of the deflecting rollers (2, 3), which

are arranged upstream and downstream of the effect roller
(4) in the direction of rotation of the pressure band

(1), is dimensioned in such a way that the pressure band
(1) can run off tangentially from the deflecting roller

(2) to the deflecting roller (3), and in the region of
the effect roller (4) there is sufficient room for the

tensioning travel of the pressure band (1).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, in order to control the 

pressure band (1), the deflecting roller (3) can be
adjusted to rotation which is always in centre and in

track.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the deflecting roller (3)

can be heated independently of the effect roller (4).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the press-treatment zone is

preceded by at least one dampening device (7, 7a) and a
steam sluice (8).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the press-treatment zone is

followed by a cooling device (13) for the textile
material (6).
