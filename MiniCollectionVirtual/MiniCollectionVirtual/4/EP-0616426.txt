<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface
acoustic wave device used as a filter or a resonator.Advancements in mobile communication technologies
in recent years have been causing communication
equipment to become much more compact and operate at
higher frequencies. Such equipment requires oscillators
and high-frequency filters as indispensable components,
and often includes surface acoustic wave devices.Conventional surface acoustic wave devices,
such as surface acoustic wave filters and surface
acoustic wave resonators, are made by forming interdigital
transducers on a piezoelectric substrate such as
lithium niobate or lithium tantalate, whereon the
surface acoustic wave is generated by applying an
alternate electric field to the interdigital transducers.
A surface acoustic wave device used in mobile
communication equipment must have good operational
characteristics in the high frequency range. High-frequency
characteristics of a surface acoustic wave is
evaluated as an insertion loss and the temperature
dependence thereof in the case of a filter. In the
case of a resonator, high-frequency characteristics are
evaluated as a resonation Q value which corresponds to
the inverse of loss, a ratio of resonance to antiresonance
(capacity ratio), and the temperature dependances
thereof. The capacity ratio has a direct effect on 
frequency pass-band. The insertion loss, the resonation
Q, and the capacity ratio depend on the electromechanical
coupling factor of the piezoelectric material.
The temperature dependence of these parameters have a
relation to the temperature dependence of the acoustic
velocity of the piezoelectric material to be used.With respect to the production process of
surface acoustic wave devices, the line width of an
interdigital transducer depends on the sound velocity
of a piezoelectric substrate, therefore the sound
velocity of the piezoelectric substrate is also important
in order to facilitate a fine patterning process
such as photolithography.The electromechanical coupling factor, the
temperature dependence, and the sound velocity are
largely dependent on the type and crystal orientation
of the material used. In the case of lithium niobate,
under the conditions of 64-degree Y-cut and X-propagation,
the electromechanical coupling factor is 11.3%,
the temperature dependence is 70 ppm/°C, and the sound
velocity is 4,742 m/sec. Under the conditions of
128-degree Y-cut and X-propagation, the electromechanical
coupling factor is 5.5%, the temperature dependence
is 75 ppm/°C, and the sound
