<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an alkaline liquid cleaning agent containing alkali solution, anionic and/or non-ionic surfactants, solubilizers plus other usual components of cleaning agents, characterized in that the solubilizer used in the cleaning agent is a mixture of di-salts of sulphooleic acids and a solubilizer which is compatible with such di-salts of sulphooleic acids. The invention also concerns the use of the cleaning agent.

A liquid alkaline cleaning formulation containing alkali metal hydroxide, 
anionic and/or nonionic surfactants, solubilizers and other typical ingredients 

of cleaning formulations selected from complexing agents, salts, thresholdactive 
substances, corrosion inhibitors and oxidizing agents, characterized 

in that the cleaning formulation has a content of 5 to 80% by weight of alkali 
metal hydroxide selected from 50% NaOH or 45% KOH and contains as 

solubilizers a mixture of sulfooleic acid disalts and 0.1 to 10% by weight of a 
solubilizer compatible with the sulfooleic acid disalts, the compatible 

solubilizers being selected from salts of aromatic sulfonic acids corresponding 
to the following formula: 


 
in which R is hydrogen or C
1-4
 alkyl,
 
and a mixture of caprylic acid and triethanolamine in a ratio by weight of 1:1. 
A cleaning formulation as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that it

of sulfooleic acid disalts and in that the sulfooleic acid disalts are potassium 
salts. 
A cleaning formulation as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 
cleaning formulation contains 0.5 to 5% by weight of solubilizers compatible 

with sulfooleic acid disalts. 
A cleaning formulation as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 
aromatic sulfonic acids are 4-alkyl sulfonic acids, R is a C
1-2
 alkyl group and 
the salts are sodium salts. 
A cleaning formulation as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that it contains 10 to 40% by weight and, more particularly,

A cleaning formulation as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it contains 2 to 20% by weight and, more particularly, 5 

to 10% by weight of anionic and/or nonionic surfactants and in that the 
surfactants are selected from fatty alkyl sulfates, fatty alkyl ether sulfates, 

fatty alkyl glucosides, fatty acid alkanolamides, alkyl sulfonates, alkylaryl 
sulfonates and amphoteric surfactants, more particularly acylamidopropyl 

dimethyl ammonium betaine and N,N-dialkyl fatty amine N-oxides. 
A cleaning formulation as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the content of complexing agents in the cleaning 

formulation is from 0.5 to 30% by weight and, more particularly, from 1 to 20%

salts are selected from carbonates, silicates, phosphates; in that the content 
of oxidizing agent in the cleaning formulation is from 0 to 40% by weight and, 

more particularly, from 15 to 35% by weight and in that the oxidizing agent is 
preferably a preparation containing active chlorine, the active chlorine content 

of the cleaning formulation being up to 10% by weight and, more particularly, 
up to 5% by weight. 
A cleaning formulation as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that it has a dynamic viscosity below 400 mPa·s, preferably 

below 100 mPa·s and more preferably below 50 mPa·s.
