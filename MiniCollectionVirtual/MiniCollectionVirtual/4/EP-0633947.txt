A method of processing pourable or free-flowing material
mixed with additives, in particular filter dusts from the

metallurgical industry and refuse incineration plants, in a
low-shaft furnace filled with melt consisting of metal and

slag and operated with direct or alternating current, in
which furnace the material is applied, via the bore in at

least one hollow electrode immersed at its head end in the
slag located in the vessel, to the surface of the slag

located in the bore of the hollow electrode, the following
steps being provided:


a) the pourable or free-flowing material is mixed in the
dry state with a carbon source acting as reducing agent
b) the bore in the hollow electrode is closed at the stem
end by immersion of the head of the electrode in the

slag and the mixture is conveyed pneumatically in
batches into the molten slag by increasing the gas

pressure prevailing in the bore,
c) during the reaction between the mixture and the slag,
thermal energy is fed thereinto to a predeterminable

extent,
d) the constituents of the mixture which vaporise or are
entrained by the combustion gas are sucked off above

slag level and fed to a filter and/or condensation
plant,
e) the constituents of the mixture which are completely or
partially melted and have a specific weight which is

greater than that of the slag sink down and are tapped
with the melt,
 
the other constituents of the mixture remain in the slag and

discharged therewith.
A method according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the pourable or free-flowing material is additionally mixed
with additives which comprise constituents intended to

influence favourably the melt composition and the course of
the process, e.g. quartz or lime.
A method according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the pourable or free-flowing material is mixed with a carbon
source having a grain size at least three times larger.
A method according to claim 2 or claim 3,

characterised in that

the mixture of pourable or free-flowing material and the
carbon sources and the additives is prepared in pellet form.
A method according to claim 1,

characterised in that

application of the mixture inside the bore of the hollow
electrode is effected in batches.
A method according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the slag is covered with a layer consisting of a reducing
agent.
A method according to claim 1,

characterised in that the supply of heat is controlled by
changing the ratios of electric power to feed rate and feed

rhythm of the mixture.
A method according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 
the individual temperatures of the metal, slag and gas are

adjusted by changing the slag height and/or the immersion
depth of the electrode in the slag.
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 8,

characterised in that

the reaction activity of the constituents of the mixture
remaining in the slag is promoted by increasing the slag

temperature.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that,

during removal by suction, the volatilised constituents of
the mixture and those entrained by the flue gas are brought

into contact with oxidising agents in the furnace chamber
above the covered slag surface.
A method according to claim 10,

characterised in that

the exhaust gas undergoes afterburning in an installation
arranged downstream in order to process any poisonous, high

temperature-resistant constituents of the mixture present in
the exhaust gas.
