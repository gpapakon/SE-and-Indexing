<DESCRIPTION>
 AUTOMATED CONTINUOUS AND RANDOM ACCESS ANALYTICAL SYSTEMField of the InventionThe present invention relates to an automated analytical system and methods for the analysis of liquid test samples. In another aspect, the invention is related to a continuous and random access system which is capable of simultaneously performing a plurality of assays, particularly heterogeneous and/or homogeneous immunoassays.Background of the InventionAlthough various known clinical analyzers for chemical, immunochemical and biological testing of samples are available, clinical technology is rapidly changing due to increasing demands in the clinical laboratory to provide new levels of service. These new levels of service must be more cost effective to decrease the operating expenditures such as labor cost and the like, and must provide shorter turnaround time of test results to reduce the patient's length of stay in the hospital as well as improve efficiency of outpatient treatment. Modernization of analytical apparatus and procedures demands consolidation of work stations to meet the growing challenge placed on clinical laboratories. Generally, analysis of a test sample involves the reaction of test samples with one or more reagents with respect to one or more analytes wherein it is frequently desired that the analysis be performed on a selective basis with respect to each test sample. However, due to the high demands placed on clinical laboratories regarding not only volume throughput but also the number and frequency of various analyses, there is a need to provide an automated 

analysis system which is capable of combining accurate analytical results, high throughput, multiple test menu versatility as well as low reagent consumption.Typically, analysis of a test sample involves forming a reaction mixture comprising the test sample and one or more reagents, and the reaction mixture is then analyzed by an apparatus for one or more characteristics of the test sample. â€¢ Reliance on automated clinical analyzers improves the efficiency of the laboratory procedures inasmuch as the technician has fewer tasks to performed. Automated clinical analyzers provide results much more rapidly while frequently avoiding operator or technician error, thus placing emphasis on accuracy and repeatability of a variety of tests. Automated clinical analyzers presently available for routine* laboratory tests include a transport or conveyor system designed to transport containers of sample liquids between various operating stations. For example,
