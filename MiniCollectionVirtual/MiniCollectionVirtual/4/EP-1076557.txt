<DESCRIPTION>
 CCR-3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the use of phenylalanine sulfonamide derivatives, and pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds as Chemokιne/CCR-3 receptor antagonistsChemokines are a superfamily of small secreted proteins There are approximately 30 distinct chemokines known with many others being characteπzed See Oppenheim et al , Properties of the Novel Promflammatory Supergene "Intercπne" Cytokine Family. Ann Rev Immun , 9, 617- 648 (1991), and Baggiolini, et al , Interleukιn-8 and Related Chemotactic Cytokmes-CXC and CC Chemokines, Ad\ Immun . 55, 97-179 (1994) The properties of the chemokines suggest that they are essential for leukocyte trafficking and inflammatory processes, and are thus important components in a number of disease states See Kita et al , Chemokines Active on Eosinophils Potential Roles in Allergic Inflammation, J_ Exp_ ed . 183, 2421 -2426 ( 1996) , Stπeter et al "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" The Role of Chemokines in Models of Human Diseases, J_ Immun . 157, 3583-3586 (1996), and Baggiolini, Eotaxm a VIC (Very Important Chemokine) of Allergic Inflammation, J_ Chn Invest . 97, 587 (1996)Chemokines mediate their effects via interactions with 7TM-G-protem coupled receptors on the surface of immune and inflammatory cells Eosinophils are promflammatory granulocytes that play a major role in allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, pruπtis and atopic dermatitis Upon activation, eosinophils release hpid mediators, cytotoxic proteins, oxygen metabolites and cytokines, all of which have the potential to produce pathophysiology Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of eosinophils or eosmophil-specific products in inflamed tissues in human diseasesThe mechanisms responsible for the selective infiltration of eosinophils in allergic diseases have yet to be clarified Recently, a CC chemokine, Eotaxm, was identified in guinea pigs and demonstrated to be present in a guinea pig model of allergic airway inflammation See Jose, et al , Eotaxm A Potent Eosmophil Chemoattractant Cytokine Detected in Guinea Pig Model of Allergic Airways Inflammation, J_ Exp Med , 179, 881-887 (1994), and Jose, et al , Eotaxm Cloning of an Eosmophil Chemoattractant Cytokine and Increased mRNA Expression in Allergen-challenged Guinea-pig Lungs. Biochem Biophys Res Comm . 205. 788-794 (1994) T e human homologue of Guinea-pig eotaxm has been expressed and has been shown to induce eosmophil infiltration when injected into
