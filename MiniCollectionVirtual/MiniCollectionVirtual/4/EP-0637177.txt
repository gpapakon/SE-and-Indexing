<ABSTRACT>
The distributor frame column includes a profiled bearer on which connection blocks and accessory equipment are mounted, especially equipment for guiding jumper leads and for fixing the profiled section. It is characterised in that this accessory equipment consists of identical rings (2), fixed directly horizontally onto the rear face (1B) of the profiled section (1) and vertically on at least one of the end parts of the front face (1A) simultaneously providing the fixing of the profiled section to the ground and/or to a wall. Application: telephony distributing frame.

A column for a telephone distribution frame, said column being referred to
as a "single column of a single-face distribution frame", and including a

"vertical" load-bearing section member constituted by a linear rail having

longitudinal channels in two opposite faces referred to as the "front" face and
the "rear" face, and two opposite side fins (8, 9) parallel to said front and rear

faces, on which section member terminal blocks (4) are mounted that are
retained on the front face of the section member, that are connected to

telephone lines, and that receive jumpers, and on which section member
items of accessory equipment are mounted comprising first items of

accessory equipment for "vertically" guiding the jumpers, at least one second
item of accessory equipment for "horizontally" guiding the jumpers, and third

items of accessory equipment for fixing the section member to a fixed
structure, said column being characterized in that said first, second, and third

items of accessory equipment are constituted by identical rings (2) fixed at will
horizontally along the rear face (1B) of the section member and vertically to at

least one of the end portions of the front face (1A) of the section member (1),
for providing rear vertical jumper-guiding and front horizontal jumper-guiding,

and simultaneously enabling the section member to be fixed to the fixed
structure, and in that each ring (2) includes an "outer" wall (11) having a plane

first portion (11B) opposite a jumper inlet/outlet (14) in the ring and assigned
to fixing the ring vertically to the section member by means of at least one

clamping first screw (25) which engages an associated rhombus-shaped end
nut (26) received in one of the channels (6) in the face of the section member,

and a first plane side segment (11D) transverse to said first portion (11B) and
assigned selectively firstly to fixing the ring horizontally to the section member

by means of at least one clamping second screw (30) that engages another
associated rhombus-shaped end nut (32) received in one of the channels in

the rear face of the section member, and secondly to fixing the section
member to the fixed structure, which is then horizontal, by means of an

anchoring third screw (27) passing through said first side segment of the ring
fixed vertically to the section member.
A column according to claim 1, characterized in that said first portion (11B)
of the outer wall (11) is provided with a guide finger (17) projecting outwardly

and being received in another channel in the front face (1A) of the section
member. 
A column according to claim 2, characterized in that said first portion (11B)
of said outer wall is provided with two holes (15A, 15B) through which two

clamping first screws (25) pass into their associated nuts (26) received in
respective ones of two of the channels (6) in the front face of the section

member.
A column according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said
first side segment (11D) is provided with an outwardly-projecting guide tab

(23) received in one of the channels (6) in the rear face of the section
member.
A column according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that said
first side segment (11D) is connected directly to said first portion (11A)

substantially at a first end of said first portion, said first end forming an end
tooth (16) projecting from the rear face of said first side segment, for guiding

and fastening in another of the channels (6) in the rear face of the section
member.
A column according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that said
outer wall is provided with a second plane side segment (11C) parallel to and

opposite from the first side segment, and assigned to fixing the section
member (1) to the fixed structure, which is then vertical, by means of the ring

fixed horizontally to the section member and of at least one anchoring screw
(35) passing through said second side segment (11C).
A column according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that it is
provided with a longitudinal recess (21) extending substantially from one of

the sides of said inlet/outlet (14) to said first portion on the outside face of
said outer wall, which recess serves to hold a label (29) for identifying the

column and the lines serving said column.
A column according to any one of claims 1 to 7 and including fourth items
of accessory equipment for holding the lines along the section member, said

column being characterized in that said fourth items of accessory equipment
are constituted by said first portions (11B) of the outer walls of the 

horizontally-fixed rings, against which portions said lines are retained by
means of holding collars.
A column according to any one of claims 1 to 7, further including a fifth item
of accessory equipment referred to as a "duct", for guiding the telephone lines

along said section member, said column being characterized in that said duct
is fixed by means of screws (34) against said first portions (11B) of the outer

walls (11) of the rings (2A) fixed horizontally to the section member (1).
A column according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that each
ring (2) is provided with an inner wall (10) connected to said outer wall (11)

via a middle spacer web (12), and delimiting an inside space (13) for
receiving the jumpers.
A column according to claim 10, characterized in that said inner wall (10)
is arcuate over its periphery, and said outer wall (11) is provided with a

second portion (11A) of arcuate shape, surrounding substantially a first half of
said inner wall (10), said inlet/outlet of said inner wall and said second portion

(11A) of the outer wall.
A column according to claim 11, characterized in that said inlet/outlet (14)
is defined by a first opening (14B) that is substantially off-center on said first

half of said inner wall (10) and by a second opening (14A) provided in the
outer wall (11) and slightly offset relative to the first opening.
A column according to any one of claims 1 to 11 and made double for a
two-face distribution frame, said column being characterized in that it includes

two single columns, mounted symmetrically facing each other and assembled
together via their rings (2A) fixed horizontally, the pairs of same-level

horizontal rings touching each other and being assembled together by screws
(40) and nuts (41) associated with respective ones of the screws (40).
A column according to any one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that
said rings (2A) are made of plastic.
