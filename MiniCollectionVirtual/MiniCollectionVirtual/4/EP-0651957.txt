<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to 
a recline-locking apparatus for a 

passenger's seat in which shoulder 
harness (12) is provided on 

a seat back (1) for a vehicle, a 
ship or an aircraft. In a base 

frame (5), a pair of left and right 
spreaders (6) are formed each of 

which is provided with a front 
support (6a) extending substantially 

horizontally between front 
and rear beams (3, 4), and a rear 

support (6b) projecting from the 
rear portion of the front support 

(6a) so as to be inclined in the 
rearward upward direction, a seat 

back frame (2) being supported 
pivotably at its lower end portion 

on the rear support (6b) of 
the spreader (6), a bearing being 

formed on the portion of the 
seat back frame (2) which is on 

the upper side of a pivotably supported 
portion thereof with respect 

to the rear support (6b) of 
the spreader (6), and which is on the side of the base frame (5), as arm (13) being fixed to the rear end portion of 

the front support (6a) of the spreader (6), a guide bore (14) opposed to the bearing formed on the seat back frame (2) 
being made in the upper portion of the arm (13), a buffer structure (16) being formed in the guide bore (14), a lower 

end portion (15b) of a lock bar (15) fixed pivotably at its upper end portion to the bearing (2b) of the seat back frame 
(2) being fitted firmly in the guide bore (14) via the buffer structure (16) so that the lower end portion (15b) of the 

lock bar (15) can be moved slidingly in the axial direction in the guide bore (14) in the arm (13) in accordance with 
a reclining movement of the seat back frame (2), an impact load of not lower than a predetermined level imparted to 

the seat back (1) due to the loss of mechanical energy occurring when the buffer structure (16) is deformed or buckled 

being damped and absorbed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tilt lock device for a
passenger seat having a seat back mounting a shoulder harness
which is applicable for a vehicle, ship or airplane, and
particularly to a shock energy absorbing mechanism in a tilt
lock device capable of damping and absorbing a shock load
applied to a seat back according to the features of the
preamble of claim 1.Conventionally, in a passenger seat for a vehicle, ship or air
plane, a reclining device has been provided in order that a
passenger suitably-tilts a seat back rearward, and a seat belt
has been mounted to keep the safety of a passenger from a
shock applied to the seat. In general, in the reclining device
of this type, seat back frames are rotatably fixed on rear
side supporting portions of spreaders forming a base frame,
and seat lock devices are linked with the lower end portions
of the seat back frames, so that the seat back frames are
reclined back and forth by extension/contraction of the seat
lock devices. In particular, the so-called shoulder harness
(hanging type seat belt) is mounted on a passenger seat
disposed on the front row for enhancing the safety of a
passenger. In the passenger seat mounting the shoulder harness 
of this type, a load applied to a passenger upon generation of
the shock is supported by the seat back itself through the
shoulder harness.Further, the above seat lock devices constituting the
reclining device of the seat can support a large load in the
compression direction, that is, in the direction of turning
and tilting the seat back rearward; however, can only a small
load in the extension direction, that is, in the direction of
raising and turning the seat back forward. In particular, in a
seat forming brake over arms, the seat back is folded forward
in such a state that the seat back frames are fixed by the
seat lock devices only by applying of a small load such as 31
lbs (13,6 kg) to the seat back, and thus a large load in the
forward direction cannot be supported. In the case that the
shoulder harness is mounted on the seat back having such a
structure, since the seat back itself cannot support a forward
load, the seat back is simply tilted or folded forward by a
forward load applied from the shoulder harness to the seat
back, which brings about a problem in losing the significance
of the mounting of the shoulder harness on the seat back.A tilt lock device is diclosed in JP-A-48-83523 and in JP-A-63-291800,
and from the JP-A-64-4234 a shock energy absorbing
mechanism is known which comprises a base frame
