<ABSTRACT>
A method of reducing the effects of interference on a radio receiver 
having access to multiple transmission sources including the steps 

of monitoring the signals received from available sources (10, Fig. 
4), utilising information derived from the received signals from each 

source to compute (12, 14, Fig.4) the most likely frequency band of 
the interference, determining from said most likely frequency (18, 

Fig. 4) in conjunction with known ephemeris for the receiver and the 
current Doppler shift of the source signals which sources are least 

susceptible to interference at said most likely frequency, and 
passing the identities of said least susceptible sources to the 

receiver acquisition software.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and means for reducing the 
effects of interference on radio receivers having access to multiple 
transmission sources, such as systems accessing multiple 
satellites. It has long been known that GPS, which is a multiple source 
system, is vulnerable to interference. For defence purposes, even 
the PPS GPS receivers are therefore often integrated with INS, or 
with adaptive antennas to lessen their vulnerability. In civil aviation, 
however, only SPS is available with the more vulnerable C/A code 
and jamming resistant techniques are less common. Of late there 
have been proposals for multiple source telecomunication systems 
for mobile radiotelephones using satellites instead of terrestrial 
base stations. In the case of GPS a key aspect of the problem caused by jamming 
is the way the correlator, which de-spreads the wide band GPS 
signals to a narrow band signal, simultaneously spreads the narrow 
band jammer signal to a wide band signal, thus lessening its effect. 
The correlator in the GPS receiver multiplies the received RF signal 
with a local replica of the relevant PRN code sequence. When the 
locally generated code is phase aligned with the received satellite 
signal then the code sequence is effectively stripped from the 
unwanted signal, collapsing its bandwidth from 2.046 MHz between 
nulls to the region of 100 Hz associated with the data modulation. 
The same process will spread a CW jammer over a null to null  
 
bandwidth of 2.046 MHz corresponding to the spectrum of the 
relevant code. Since the GPS C/A code repeats every 1 mS, the 
spectrum so generated in the receiver is not a continuous spectrum 
but a line spectrum with the lines separated by 1 kHz (the inverse of 
1 mS). Since the GPS receiver has a narrow post correlation bandwidth 
adequate only to pass the 50 bit per second data, in general only 
one such spectral line will interfere with the wanted signal at any 
one time. The magnitude of the power in each spectral line with 
respect to the original received jamming power is determined by the 
spectrum of the relevant PRN code, and the frequency offset (i.e. 
which spectral line). On average the power per spectral line is 'Za' given by:

Za = 10 * log 10 [2*10⁶/1*10³] = 33 dB 


 
which is the ratio of the 2 MHz controlled by the switching rate in 
the code, and the 1 kHz controlled by the code repetition rate. But since the switching gives rise to a 
sin(x)/x  
 type voltage 
spectrum, the spectral density is some 3 dB stronger near the 
cent

A method of reducing the effects of interference on a radio 
receiver having access to multiple transmission sources,including 

the steps of monitoring the signals received from available sources 
being tracked by the receiver, characterised in that the method 

includes the steps of deriving information from the received signals 
from each source (10, Fig. 4), computing the most likely frequency 

band of the interference (12, 14, Fig. 4), determining from said most 
likely frequency in conjunction with known current ephemeris data 

of the receiver and the current Doppler shift of the source signals 
which sources are least susceptible to interference at said most 

likely frequency (16, 18, Fig. 4), and passing the identity of said 
least susceptible sources to the receiver acquisition software. 
A method of reducing the effects of interference on a radio 
receiver having access to multiple transmission sources including 

the steps of measuring the signal level and Doppler shift of the 
signal frequency, characterised in that the method includes the 

steps of recording the signal history (10, Fig. 4) for each source 
being tracked by the receiver over a predetermined period of time, 

analysing the recorded histories of the signals (12, Fig. 4) to 
calculate signal degradation profiles describing the actual 

deterioration of the signals with respect to time and Doppler shift of 
all the sources being tracked, shifting the spectrum of each source 

by its Doppler shift frequency and computing the signal degradation 
for that frequency (14, Fig. 4), comparing the computed signal 

degradation with the actual degradation to identify the most likely 
frequency band of interference and determining (18, Fig. 4) from 

said most likely frequency in conjunction with the known current 
ephemeris data for the receiver and the current Doppler shift of the 

source signals which available sources are least susceptible to 
interference at said most likely frequency, and passing the identity 

of said least susceptible sources to the receiver acquisition 
software. 
A method according to claim 2 wherein the signal history for 
each source is recorded periodically in a cyclic multistage buffer 

means.
