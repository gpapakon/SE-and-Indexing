<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor relay has two output MOSFET pairs (60,61), 
each of which is series-connected with the other. Each 

MOSFET pair is comprised of two MOSFETs series-connected 
oppositely to each other, and these MOSFETs are controlled 

to turn on or off simultaneously. The semiconductor relay 
further includes a switch (8), which is inserted between the 

ground and the junction of the two MOSFET pairs. When 
these MOSFETs are in an off condition, said switch is 

closed in order to release electric charges accumulated on 
said MOSFETs and to increase the off-resistance of this 

semiconductor relay. On the other hand, when the MOSFETs 
are in an on condition, said switch is opened so as to 

connect both MOSFET pairs in series. As a result, a 
semiconductor relay having a high off-resistance can be 

obtained without increasing the on-resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor relay, and 
more specifically to a semiconductor relay for transmitting 
high frequency signals. From US-A-5 146 100 it is known to provide a 
semiconductor ralay comprising two MOS FET pairs, each of 
which including two MOS FETs series-connected oppositely, said 
MOS FET pairs being connected in series with each other, means 
for simultaneously turning on or turning off said two MOS FET 
pairs, and a switch inserted between the junction of said two 
MOS FET pairs and a Zener diode, and operated for 
substantially minimizing the drain to gate capacitances. 
During the turned-off condition, a reverse voltage is 
generated across said Zener diode so that the junction of the 
two MOS FET pairs is relatively pulled up. The publication "Electronic Engineering", May 1971, pages 
33-35, and JP-A-63 093 217 each disclose a T-switch design. 
Therein, when a junction between transistors is grounded for 
limiting high frequency, such grounding also serves to turn-off 
the switch. A conventional semiconductor relay is described in more 
detail hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 1 to 4 of the 
drawings. As shown in Fig. 1, this conventional semiconductor 
relay  
 
has a light emitting diode (referred to as LED, below) 101 
in its primary side. The secondary side of this relay is 
comprised of a photo diode array 102 for generating 
electromotive force on the reception of light emitted by 
LED 101, a resistor 103, a diode array 104 parallel-connected 
with resistor 103, an p-channel junction FET 
(referred to as J-FET, below) 105, and one pair of MOSFETs 
106a and 106b series-connected oppositely to each other. 
Diode array 104 and J-FET 105 form a circuit for 
discharging the gates of MOSFETs 106a and 106b. According to the above mentioned structure, photo 
diode array 102 does not generate a voltage unless LED 101 
emits light. In this case, J-FET 105 is held "on" so that 
the respective substrates and gates of MOSFETs 106a and 
106b conduct. This makes both MOSFETs 106 to be "off". On the contrary, once a current flows through LED 101 
and it emits light, photo diode array 102 generates an 
electromotive force in a forward direction. This makes J-FET 
105 to turn off and a positive voltage is applied to 
the respective gates of MOSFETs 106a and 106b. As a 
result, both MOSFETs 106a and 106b turn on to connect  
 
output terminal 108a with output terminal 108b. The prior art semiconductor relay mentioned above has 
the following disadvantage. As far as the relay is in an
