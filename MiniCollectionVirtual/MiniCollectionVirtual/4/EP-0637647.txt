<ABSTRACT>
The metal girder element (5, 6) comprises a web section (7, 10) fixed along its longitudinal edges respectively to an upper base section (8) and a lower base section (9). Each base section (8, 9) of this element (1, 2) comprises, on its outer surface which is opposite the web (7, 10), connection elements (12, 13), the number, dimensions and positions of which are predetermined so that the said connection elements (12, 13) are capable of withstanding the thrust (drive) forces on the said base section (8, 9) by concrete during the deformations intended for the structure thus formed.

<CLAIMS>
A structural element (1, 2) to achieve, by 
means of successive structural elements (1, 2), a hybrid 

elongate structure with a box-shaped type cross section 
including a concrete upper slab and a concrete lower slab 

connected to each other over their entire length by at 
least two metal girders, characterised in that the 

structural element includes at least two metal girder 
elements (5, 6), an upper slab section (3) and a lower 

slab section (4), in that each metal girder element (5, 
6) includes a web section (7, 10) fixed along its 

longitudinal edges to a upper flange section (8) and to a 
lower flange section (9), respectively, the upper (8) and 

lower (9) flange sections being fixed to the upper slab 
section (3) and lower slab section (4), respectively, and 

in that each flange section (8, 9) of said metal girder 
element (5, 6) includes, on its outer surface (8a, 9a) 

opposite to the web section (7, 10), connection elements 
(12, 13, 28) adapted to be imbedded in concrete and 

connecting the flange sections to the concrete of the 
corresponding slab, the number, dimensions and positions 

of said connection elements of a flange section (8, 9) 
being predetermined such that said elements are capable 

of withstanding the tensile stresses exerted on said 
flange section (8, 9) by the concrete of the 

corresponding slab section (3, 4) of the same structural 
element (1, 2) in the course of the deformations 

anticipated for said structure. 
A structural element according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the connection elements (12, 13, 

28) comprise angle sections (12) welded on the outer 
surface (8a, 9a) of each fla
nge (8, 9).  
 
A structural element according to claim 1 or 
2, characterised in that the connection elements (12, 13, 

28) comprise head bolts (12) welded at their end opposite 
to the head on the outer surface (8a, 9a) of each flange 

(8, 9). 
A structural element according to one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the web section (7) 

is a flat plate. 
A structural element according to one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the web section (10) 

is a folded plate. 
A structural element according to one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the length of each 

of the flange sections (8, 9) is substantially inferior 
to the corresponding length of said metal girder element 

(5, 6). 
A method to implement the structural element

hybrid elongate structure with a box-shaped type cross 
section by means of successive structural elements (1, 2)

4), on the one hand, and the web sections (7, 10), on the 

other hand, of said structural elements (1, 2) are 
connected together, characterised in that the flange 

sections (8, 9) are left separated from one another, and 
in that the slab sections (3, 4) are linked together 

using predetermined linkage means (35, 36, 37, 38) 
adapted to transmit, from one structural element (1, 2) 

to an adjacent structural element (1, 2), all the 
longitudinal stresses generated within the elongate 

structure during its use. 
A method according to claim 7, to build a 
structure by assembling prefabricated hybrid structural 

elements one after the other, characterised in that first  
 

the upper and lower slab sections (3, 4) of an element 
(N) are linked to the upper and lower slab sections (3, 

4) of the previous element (N-1), and then the web 
sections (7, 10) of the element (N) are linked to those 

of the previous element (N-1). 
A method according to claim 7, to build a 
structure by means of successive, cantilevered structural 

elements (1, 2) assembled and built on-site, 
characterised in that it includes the following steps: 


pouring the concrete of the lower (4) and

finishing linking the WEB sections (7, 10) of 
the element (N) to those of the previous element (N-1); 
pouring the concrete of the lower (4) and
