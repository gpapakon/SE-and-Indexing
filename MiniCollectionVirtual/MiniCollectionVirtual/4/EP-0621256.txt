<ABSTRACT>
Chloroformyloxy-substituted isophthaloyl chlorides are 
made by forming a mixture of hydroxy-substituted isophthalic 

acid, or salt thereof, catalyst, phosgene and solvent, 
heating the mixture in a pressure vessel under autogeneous 

pressure, treating the mixture to remove the solvent, and 
distilling the mixture to yield the chloroformyloxy-substituted 

isophthaloyl chloride. The preferred 
chloroformyloxy-substituted isophthaloyl chloride is 

5-chloroformyloxyisophthaloyl chloride and the preferred 
catalyst is imidazole.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of 
chloroformyloxy isophthaloyl chlorides. According to this invention haloformyloxy-substituted 
isophthaloyl chlorides are prepared by reacting an hydroxy-substituted 
isophthalic acid, or a salt of hydroxy-substituted 
isophthalic acid, phosgene, and a solvent in the 
presence of a catalyst, under autogenous pressure at an 
elevated temperature, e.g. in a pressure vessel. The 
preferred hydroxy-substituted isophthalic acid is 5-hydroxyisophthalic 
acid and the preferred solvent is 
chlorinated benzene. Examples of chloroformyloxy-substituted 
isophthaloyl chlorides are 
4-chloroformyloxyisophthaloyl chloride, 
2-chloroformyloxyisophthaloyl chloride, and 
5-chloroformyloxyisophthaloyl chloride. 5-chloroformyloxyisophthaloyl chloride (CFIC) also may 
be produced by using alternatives to the preferred reactants 
mentioned above. For example, salts of 5-hydroxyisophthalic 
acid such as disodium 5-hydroxyisophthalate or trisodium 5-hydroxyisophthalate 
may be substituted for 5-hydroxyisophthalic 
acid. Similarly, the catalyst imidazole, 
may be replaced with other heteroatom-containing compounds 
capable of complexing phosgene. Examples of such catalysts 
include, but are not limited to, pyridine, N,N-dimethylformamide 
(DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and 
the like. Likewise, solvents such as dioxane and methylene 
chloride may be employed, so long as the solvent is 
reasonably unreactive with the reactants and products. The chloroformyl substituted isophthaloyl chlorides made 
by the process of the invention may be used in solution in 
a solvent to treat polyfunctional amine impregnated 
substrates which treated substrates may be used as reverse 
osmosis membranes. The specification of copending 
EP 91307999.2 describes a method of making reverse osmosis 
membranes wherein a polyfunctional amine treated substrate  
 
is treated with a haloformyloxy-substituted acyl halide. 5-chloroformyloxyisophthaloyl chloride (CFIC) was 
prepared by heating a mixture of 25g of 5-hydroxyisophthalic 
acid, 0.3g of imidazole, 70g of phosgene, and 100ml of 
chlorobenzene solvent in a pressure vessel at 160°C for 18 
hours under autogeneous pressure. Removal of the solvent, 
followed by distillation of the product at 143-151°C and 1mm 
Hg yielded 12.6g of (CFIC) (white solid, mp: 55.5-56.5°C).
