<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a mixing device for highly viscous to stiff substances. It consists of a plastic pipe (2) in which is fitted a specially designed stationary mixing rod (1). For the purposes of mixing, the material is pressed through the plastic pipe (2). The mixing rod (1) consists of some twelve components (3) taking the form of a double screw. The screw channels (4) are turned through 180  inside a component (3). Each component (3) is offset by 90  in relation to the two bordering components (3). There are deflecting wings (12) in the channels (4) which divert the viscous to stiff material from the pipe wall (10) towards the centre of the pipe. Thus, despite the large diameter of the pipe, the material is properly rotated to be uniformly mixed. The low production costs make the device suitable for once-only use.
