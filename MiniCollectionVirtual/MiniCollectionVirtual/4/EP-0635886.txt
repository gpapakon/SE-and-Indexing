A monolithic component, incorporating a
protection diode in parallel with each pair of diodes

of a plurality of pairs of diodes, the diodes of each
pair being connected in series and oriented so as to

have the same polarity as the protection diode,
comprising a semiconductor substrate (1) of a first

conductivity type, having an upper surface and a lower
surface, including:


first regions (P'1, P'2, P'3...) of the second
conductivity type that are formed in a first portion of

the substrate and extending from the upper surface of
the substrate;
second regions (N1, N2, N3...) constituted by
upper portions of the substrate separated from the

first portion and whose lateral surfaces are delineated
by an insulating wall (2) of the second conductivity

type, and whose bottoms are adjacent to a third region
(3) of the second conductivity type;
a fourth highly doped region (4) of the second
conductivity type extending from the lower surface in

the third region (3);
a fifth highly doped region (5) of the first
conductivity type on all the lower surface of the substrate;
first metallizations (M1, M2, M3... ), each of
which connecting a respective first region (P'1, P'2,

P'3...) to a respective second region (N1, N2, N3...);
and
a second metallization (10) on at least one
portion of the insulating wall (2), each pair of diodes

being formed by the first portion of the substrate, a
first region, a second region connected to the first 

region of the pair of diodes through a first
metallization, and by the third region, the protection

diode being formed by the fourth region and the fifth
region.
The monolithic component of claim 1,
characterized in that it further includes a third

metallization (11) coating the lower surface of the
substrate.
The monolithic component of claim 1,
characterized in that the thickness of the first

regions, of the insulating walls and of the third
region is larger than half the thickness of the

substrate.
Utilization of a monolithic component
according to any of claims 1 to 3 as a protection diode

array, in which each of the first metallizations (M1,
M2, M3...) is connected to a line to be protected and

wherein the second metallization (10) is connected to a
reference voltage (REF).
The utilization of a monolithic
component according to claim 4, wherein the reference

voltage is the ground.
The utilization of a monolithic
component according to claim 4, when dependent upon

claim 2, wherein the second and third metallizations
(10, 11) are connected to a d.c. power supply source

(Val) in series with a resistor (R), the voltage of the
power supply source being lower than the avalanche

voltage of the protection diode.
Utilization of the monolithic component
of claim 2 as a self-protected rectifying bridge for an

n- phase power supply, including n first regions and n
second regions, wherein each i-th (i being comprised 

between 1 and n) first metallization (Mi) connecting
the i-th first region (P'i) to the i-th second region

(Ni) is connected to an i-th a.c. supply terminal, the
second metallization (10) constitutes a d.c. supply

terminal, and the third metallization (11) constitutes
the other d.c. supply terminal.
