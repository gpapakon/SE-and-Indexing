<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing polyolefins having a controllable broadened molecular weight distribution utilizing transition metal metallocene catalyst systems, wherein the metallocene has at least one cyclopentadienyl ring which is substituted by a substituent having a 2 DEG  or 3 DEG  carbon atom through which it is covalently bonded to the cyclopentadienyl ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for olefin
polymerization and to the resultant polyolefin product,
particularly those having broadened molecular weight
distribution. Particularly, but not exclusively, this
invention also relates to the use of mixed
polymerization catalysts for controlling the molecular
weight distribution of a polymer.Olefin polymerization catalysts comprising a
metallocene and an aluminum alkyl component have long
been known. See, for example, AU-A-2436/88, DE-A-2,608,863
published September 9, 1977, DE-A-2,608,933
published September 9, 1977, EP-A-0035242 published
September 9, 1991 and EP-A-129368 published September
9, 1991 which disclose catalyst systems which are
commercially useful for the polymerization of ethylene.
The molecular weight of the polymer product can be
controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature or the
amount of cocatalyst, or by the addition of hydrogen. The later publications require use of alumoxane or
cocatalyst, which is produced by reacting an aluminum
alkyl with water. Such reaction is very rapid and
highly exothermic.Alumoxanes may be prepared, for example, by adding
extremely finely divided water, such as in the form of
a humid solvent, to a solution of aluminum alkyl in
benzene, other aromatics, or aliphatic hydrocarbons; or
by reacting aluminum alkyl with a hydrated salt, such
as hydrated copper sulfate.See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,912,075, 4,937,301,
4,925,821, 4,937,217, 4,935,397 and 5,006,500 for
teachings on alumoxane production.U.S. Patent No. 5,006,500 describes procedures by
which an alumoxane is produced directly on a silica
support by reacting an alkyl aluminum with water-containing
silica. Such alumoxane-silica product is
then reacted with a metallocene to yield a supported
metallocene-alumoxane catalyst useful in the
polymerization of olefins.Catalyst components comprising titanium and
zirconium metallocenes produce polymers having a
typically narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD),
i.e. Mw/Mn. Although there are many commercial
applications for polyolefins with a narrow MWD as a
desirable property, it is often desirable to have a
polyolefin with a broader MWD, for example to ease the
processability of polyolefins into finished form. The
above cited publications neither disclose polyethylenes
having a broad MWD nor how to obtain such
polyethylenes.A method of broadening the molecular weight
distribution of polyolefins has long been desired by
and needed in the industry. For many applications, such 
as extrusion and molding processes, it
