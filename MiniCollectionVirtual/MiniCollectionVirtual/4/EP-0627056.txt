<ABSTRACT>
A hose protector (1) for placing around a hose (3) with even intervals, which reduces friction and wear on the hose (3). Hose protectors (1) will not be caught on the base when they are made of a central portion (4) with a greatest diameter and two end portions (5, 6) having an evenly declining diameter away from the central portion (4). As the outermost edges (5', 6') of the two end portions (5, 6) are in sealing engagement against the outer side of the hose (3), the hose is especially suitable for use within the food industry where slots, unevenness, and the like must not occur in which bacterial growth may occur. A hose (3) provided with hose protectors may be made by casting the hose protectors around a hose (3) made in advance or by wedging in two halves around a hose (3). The hose has such a stiffness and such a number of hose protectors that the hose does not deflect to such an extent that it touches a base (12), onto which the hose protectors (1) rest.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTECTOR FOR A HOSE AND A HOSE PROVIDED WITH SUCH PROTECTOR. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION.The present invention relates to a protector for a hose for placing around a hose with even intervals along the length thereof in order to 5 reduce friction and wear, and provided in the form of an annular mem¬ ber which is solid or substantially solid, is mounted firmly around the hose, and which has an inner diameter corresponding to the outer diameter of the hose.10 From US Patent No. 1,372,629 a hose protector is known. In said patent a hose protector is described, which is intended for reducing the friction and the wear on the hoses in large vacuum cleaner systems. With due regard thereto, hose protectors are placed with mutual dis¬ tances in the form of annular members which are tubular, and which en-15 circle the hose to be protected. Furthermore, the hose protectors com¬ prise an anchorage band which is connected to an end of the tubular member, and which is fastened around the hose in order to prevent dis¬ placement of the tubular protecting members.20 Such a construction is difficult to use in buildings or in areas, where the base is uneven as there will be a great risk of the hose being caught on the hose protectors. Furthermore, the hose protectors described will not be suited for use within the food industry because of the risk of bacterial growth in the tubular hose protectors.25From British Patent No. 1,327,659 hose protectors of the above-men¬ tioned type are known, said protectors remedy a part of the above-men¬ tioned drawbacks. Said patent discloses the method of using annular, solid rings of synthetic material as hose protectors.30Such a construction is still difficult to use in buildings or in areas, where the base is uneven as there will be a great risk of the hose being caught on the edged hose protectors. Furthermore, the hose protectors described will not be suited for use within the food indus- 35 try because the of risk of bacterial growth in the slot-shaped spaces*4 between the hose and the hose protectors used.Within the food industry, e.g. bakeries, butchers, slaughterhouses, the fishing industry, and the ice-cream industry, wear on the wash 

down hoses will be a large problem as such hoses have to be discarded due to the risk of bacterial growth. When an outer protecting layer on a wash down hose is thoroughly worn, and a wire reinforcement is cleared, it is thereby necessary to discard the hose.It is the object of the present invention to provide a hose protector of the

CLAIMS.
1. Protector for a hose for placing around a hose with even intervals along the length thereof in order to reduce friction and wear, and provided in the form of an annular member which is solid or substanti¬ ally solid, is mounted firmly around the hose, and which has an inner diameter corresponding to the outer diameter of the hose, c h a - r a c t e r i z e d in that the annular member has a central portion having a greatest diameter and two end portions having an evenly de- clining diameter which at each end declines to the outer diameter of the hose, and that at least the outermost edges of the end portions of the annular member are in sealing engagement against the outer side of the hose.
2. Protector for a hose according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that the annular member is constituted by a barrel-shaped member, in which the central portion is substantially cylindrical, and in which the two end portions are substantially truncated cone-shaped, and that said barrel-shaped member is casted in one piece around the hose.
3. Protector for a hose according to claims 1 or 2, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the annular member is made of two halves, which are provided with means for locking the halves together in a wedged state around the hose.
4. Protector for a hose according to claim 3, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that the two halves are identical.
5. Protector for a hose according to any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the annular member is made of a solid plastic material in a strong, conspicuous colour.
6. Protector for a hose according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r - i z e d in that the generatrix for the outer side of the two end por¬ tions together with the central axis of the hose form an angle, which is between approximately 10° and 45°.
7. Hose, preferably a water hose, which is provided with hose protec- 


tors according to any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that the hose has such a stiffness, and is provided with such a number of hose protectors that the deflection of the hose be¬ tween two subsequent hose protectors is less than half of the differ- ence between the outer diameter of the hose protectors and the hose.
8. Hose according to claim 7, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that hose protectors are made of another plastic material than the outer layer of the hose.
