<ABSTRACT>
The device for separating RF signals in at least a first and a second frequency range comprises a first electrode (10) for supplying the RF signals and a second electrode (16) for supplying the RF signals in the first frequency range. The first electrode (10) is coupled to the second electrode (16) via a first impedance element (12). The second electrode (16) is coupled to a reference point (18) via a second impedance element (14). A first impedance value of the first impedance element (12) is high for the RF signals in the second frequency range, whereas this first impedance value is comparatively low for the RF signals in the first frequency range. A second impedance value of the second impedance element (14) is substantially equal to zero for the RF signals in the second frequency range, and this second impedance value is unequal to zero for the RF signals in the first frequency range.

<DESCRIPTION>
Device for separating RF signals.The invention relates to a device for separating RF signals in at least a first and a second frequency range, which device comprises a first electrode for supplying the RF signals and also a second electrode for supplying the RF signals in the first frequency range. The invention also relates to an assembly of an antenna and such a device.A device as described in the opening paragraph is currently often used in motorcars which are equipped with an antenna suitable for receiving both radio and telephony signals and is also suitable for transmitting telephony signals. Examples of such radio signals are AM and FM signals. GSM signals are examples of telephony signals. The radio signals received by such an antenna can be processed and reproduced by a radio receiver. For satisfactorily processing these radio signals, it is necessary that the telephony signals in a device as described in the opening paragraph are separated from the radio signals. However, the use of the known devices leads to a considerable decrease of the sensitivity of the radio reception because the radio signals are also attenuated by these devices. This is a great problem, notably for the reception of AM signals.It is an object of the invention to provide a device for separating RF signals of the type described in the opening paragraph, leaving the amplitude of the RF signals in the first frequency range substantially unchanged.To this end, the device according to the invention is characterized in that the first electrode is coupled to the second electrode via a first impedance element, the second electrode is coupled to a reference point via a second impedance element, and the first impedance element has a first impedance value which is comparatively high for the RF signals in the second frequency range and comparatively low for the RF signals in the first frequency range, the second impedance element having a second impedance value which is substantially equal to zero for the RF signals in the second frequency range and unequal to 

zero for the RF signals in the first frequency range.The invention is based on the recognition that, in the known devices, the attenuation of the RF signals in the first frequency range is caused by the fact that the known devices are provided with one or more capacitors coupled between the signal path and ground. The use of such capacitors follows from the application of one of the conventional methods of designing filters.In the device according to the invention, the use
