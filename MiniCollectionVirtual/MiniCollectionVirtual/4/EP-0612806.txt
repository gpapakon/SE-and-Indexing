<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flame retarding 
resin composition containing organo-phosphorus compound 
as a flame retarding agent, having high impact 
resistance, excellent heat resistance, and a superior 
self-fire-extinguishing characteristic. Conventionally, thermoplastic resins of which the 
impact resistance have been promoted by a rubbery polymer 
are known as resins generally called ABS resins. Such 
thermoplastic resins must have flame retardancy depending 
on use to which they are directed. This is particularly 
applicable when thermoplastic resins are used for 
household products, electrical appliances, OA equipment, 
automotive products, and building materials. A commonly 
known method of imparting flame retardancy to 
thermoplastic resins, such as ABS resins, consists of 
blending a flame retarding agent. In many cases, flame 
retarding agents comprise a halogen-containing compound 
such as a brominated diphenyl oxide compound, a 
brominated polycarbonate compound, or the like. A 
superior flame retarding effect is demonstrated when 
these flame retarding agents are blended together with  
 
antimony trioxide. However, the addition of said 
halogen-containing compound to resin compositions causes 
generation of noxious compounds, when the resin 
compositions are molded or burnt. In particular, 
generation of dioxin and furan which are fatally 
poisonous to human causes a serious problem. As a solution to this type of problem, the addition 
of a compound containing phosphorus and/or nitrogen to 
the rubber-reinforced thermoplastic resin material, 
including ABS resins, as a flame retarding agent in place 
of a halogen-containing compound has been proposed. 
These compounds, however, are less effective in the 
flame-retarding effect than halogen-containing compounds. 
In addition, the flame-retarding effect of these 
compounds is especially low when they are used for 
styrene-type rubber-reinforced thermoplastic resins, such 
as ABS resin, so that a large amount of these compounds 
must be added in order to achieve an adequate flame-retarding 
effect. The addition of a large amount of the 
compounds containing phosphorus and/or nitrogen, however, 
conspicuously impairs impact resistance and heat 
resistance of the resin. In an effort in eliminating this drawback, German 
Patent 3,401,835 A proposed a blend of a thermoplastic 
graft copolymer, a char-forming novolac resin, a  
 
phosphorus compound, and a melamine, as a polymer 
composition having a high flame retardancy. This polymer
