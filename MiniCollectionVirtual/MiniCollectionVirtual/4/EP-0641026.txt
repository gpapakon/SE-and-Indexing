plurality of photoelectric converting sections, vertical

charge transfer sections each comprising first and second
vertical charge transfer electrodes (26a, 26b) and a

vertical charge transfer region (23), and power feeding
sections, each of the power feeding sections is divided

into first through fourth metal wires (28a, 28b, 28c,
28d). The first through the third metal wires (28a, 28b,

28c) are formed in a first layer of a conductive film.
The fourth metal wire (28d) is formed in a second layer

of the conductive film. The first and the third metal
wires (28a, 28c) are alternately connected to the first

vertical charge transfer electrodes (26a) via contact
holes (27). The second and the fourth metal wires (28b,

28d) are alternately connected to the second vertical
charge transfer electrodes (26b) via contact holes (27).

The first through the fourth metal wires (28a, 28b, 28c,
28d) are applied with first through fourth clock pulse

signals (1, 2, 3, 4), respectively, which are
different in phase from one another. The first and the

third metal wires (28a, 28c) only light-shield areas

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid-state image 
pickup device for use in picking up image and, more 
particularly, to a solid-state image pickup device 
comprising power feeding wires, which serve as 
light-shield films, for supplying clock pulses to charge 
transfer electrodes provided along columns of 
photoelectric converting sections. In comparison with image pickup tubes generally 
used in prior art, solid-state image pickup devices are 
superior in small-sized, lightweight, high durability, 
low power consumption, low afterimage, low burning, and 
so on. As a result, the solid-state image pickup devices 
already surpass the image pickup tubes in a camera field 
for public use where movie cameras have small image size. 
Furthermore, the solid-state image pickup devices replace 
in a camera field for business use where cameras have 
relatively large image size. Solid-state image pickup devices for a 
high-definition television (HDTV) are typical of the 
solid-state image pickup devices having the relatively 
large image size, for example, solid-state image pickup  
 
devices having an optical size of one inch or two-thirds 
inches. In such solid-state image pickup devices, 
driving pulses are generally supplied to transfer 
electrodes of polysilicon in both sides of an image 
region. The transfer electrodes of polysilicon are 
commonly disposed in all of one horizontal line. In the 
solid-state image pickup devices of such a driving pulse 
supplying method, the transfer electrodes of polysilicon 
have relatively high resistance and relatively high 
capacitance. As a result, such solid-state image pickup 
devices are disadvantageous in that pulse amplitude of 
the driving pulses remarkably decreases in a central 
portion of the image region and the amount of maximum 
transferring charges decreases especially when a transfer 
speed is fast. In order to overcome the above-mentioned 
disadvantage, proposal has been made by Toshihida 
Nobusada et al in a paper submitted to "1989 IEEE 
International Solid-State Circuits Conference" as Paper 
No. WPM 8.1, pages 88-89, February 15, 1989 under the 
title of "Frame Interline Transfer CCD Sensor for HDTV 
Camera." The solid-state image pickup device of an 
interline transfer type generally comprises photoelectric 
converting sections for converting incident light into 
signal charges, vertical charge transfer sections for 
reading the signal charges out of the photoelectric 
converting sections as read charges to transfer the read  
 
charges along a vertical
