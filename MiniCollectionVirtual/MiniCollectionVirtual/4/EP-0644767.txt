<ABSTRACT>
A composition for the treatment of livestock suffering from disorders such as fluid depletion, acidosis, and imbalances or loss of essential electrolytes, same to be made up in water at point of use as an oral rehydration formulation, comprises an intimate mixture of an energy source, electrolytes, and bicarbonate precursors, which precursors are provided as physiologically acceptable carboxylic acid anions with corresponding physiologically acceptable cations including sodium, the yield of bicarbonate being in excess of 30 millimole/litre (mmol/1) of final formulation, and the concentration of sodium being in excess of 80 mmol/1 of final formulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to veterinary products for the 
treatment of livestock suffering from disorders which may 
arise from nutritional, bacterial, viral or protozoal causes 
and lead to fluid depletion, acidosis, and imbalances or 
loss of essential electrolytes. These problems typically 
arise in immature animals such as calves and lambs. The intestinal losses of water and electrolytes, 
including bicarbonate, are major factors in the pathogenesis 
of diarrhoea in calves. Calf scour continues to represent a 
major financial loss to the farmer and also a great deal of 
concern to the veterinary profession. Thus this invention 
is primarily intended to be applied in rehabilitating calves 
suffering from scour and description of the invention herein 
will be related thereto. However it will be appreciated 
that other animals may also suffer from abnormal conditions 
leading to similar dehydration, acidosis and electrolyte 
loss. Thus it could be used for promoting recovery of 
competition horses severely stressed from fluid loss after a 
vigorous event. The causes of dehydration have been well researched and 
although many interacting factors have to be considered it 
is observed that severe dehydration includes reduced fluid 
absorption as well as increased excretion and is accompanied 
by loss of sodium and other electrolytes from the 
extracellular fluids. Acidosis, where blood pH drops from 
about 7.34 - 7.40 to a lower range of perhaps 6.85 - 7.15, 
is mainly attributable to increases in loss of bicarbonate 
ion, increases in lactic acid which dissociates to the 
lactate and hydrogen ions, and additional factors such as 
increases in other organic acid levels produced by infecting 
bacteria. Losses of sodium and bicarbonate ions are considered to 
be the most serious aspects of diarrhoea but losses of 
potassium and calcium are also observed. There are already many veterinary products currently 
available which have varying degrees of efficacy with 
respect to replacement of electrolytes, correction of 
acidosis and provision of an energy source. The Applicant's 
own Life Aid P (trade mark) is one such rehydration product,  
 
whilst another is Lectade Plus (trade mark), of SmithKline 
Beecham Animal Health. Whereas rehydration products may be administered 
intravenously, orally, or subcutaneously, the oral route is 
much preferred unless dehydration has already progressed to 
a serious level (perhaps 6 to 10% or above) when a 
combination of parenteral and oral administration is 
employed. An
