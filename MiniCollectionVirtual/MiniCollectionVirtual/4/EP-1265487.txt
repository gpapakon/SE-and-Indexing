<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid compositions, and in particular to liquid compositions containing bread improver agents, and methods for their preparations.Bread improvers, more correctly known as dough conditioners, are now widely used in the baking industry. Bread improvers are typically added to improve one or more characteristics of a baked bread product, for example the crumb structure or degree of aeration of the bread. The precise manner in which bread improvers exert their effect is not well understood, but it is known that bread improvers can act by means of a variety of different chemical mechanisms. Thus, bread improvers can be categorized according to their mode of action, and examples of categories of bread improvers include oxidants, reducing agents, and enzymic agents.Examples of commonly used oxidizing agents include ascorbic acid, and alkaline metal bromates and iodates such as potassium bromate and potassium iodate. Although the use of bromates and iodates is no longer allowed in the UK, these substances are still used in many other countries. In the UK, at least, ascorbic acid has become the bread improver of choice.Oxidizing bread improving agents are believed to act by bringing about cross-linking between protein chains thereby assisting the building of a three-dimensional protein network within the dough. The three-dimensional protein network provides a structure to the dough thereby enabling the maintenance of an aerated structure typical of many modem breads. The cross-linking effect is believed to arise by virtue of the oxidation and linking of cystine thiol groups to form cysteine containing disulphide bridges between adjacent chains.Examples of other bread improving agents include L-cysteine and inorganic reducing agents such as alkaline metal metabisulphites, for example sodium and potassium metabisulphites.A wide variety of enzymes can be incorporated into bread improver compositions and these include amylases such a-amylase, hemicellulase, lipases, lipoxygenases, peroxidases, glucose oxidases, transglutaminases, by way of example.Hitherto, bread improver compositions have generally been provided in the form of solid, e.g. powdered, compositions. However, the use of high speed bread baking and processing machinery, and the high through-put production lines now in use require accurate and rapid measurement and dispensing of improving agents into the dough mix. The provision of liquid compositions would enable the measurement and dispensing of required amounts of bread
