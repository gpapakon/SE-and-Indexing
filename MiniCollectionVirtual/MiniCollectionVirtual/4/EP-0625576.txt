<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a DNA fragment which 
contains a gene responsible for the function of autonomous 

replication of plasmid in a Coryneform, said gene being 
obtained from plasmid pBY503 held in 
Brevibacterium stationis
, 
and in which at least one point mutation capable of increasing 

the copy number of plasmid exists on said gene region. By 
using a Coryneform transformed with the vector constructed 

using said DNA fragment and an industrially useful gene such as 
aspartase gene or tryptophan synthase gene, production of the 

useful product occurs with higher efficiency than conventional 
methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to DNA fragment containing a 
gene which imparts the ability to autonomously replicate to a 
plasmid vector containing it. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to a DNA fragment containing such a gene in a 
plasmid held in a Coryneform. The DNA fragment of the present 
invention contains at least one point mutation in the gene 
region such that a plasmid vector containing it has an 
increased copy number per Coryneform. The present invention 
also provides a method for producing a useful biologically 
product using such a plasmid vector. Coryneforms, including the genus Brevibacterium, are 
extremely useful in industry because of their ability to 
produce amino acids, organic acids, purine nucleotides, etc. 
In order to enhance the productivity of fermentative products 
by these Coryneforms, plasmid vectors which employ Coryneforms 
as host microorganisms have been developed using recombinant 
DNA techniques. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,185,262 describes plasmid 
pCRY3 which comprises (1) a DNA region isolated from plasmid 
pBY503 held in Brevibacterium stationis IFO 12144 (FERM BP-2515) 
which encodes a gene useful for autonomous replication of 
a plasmid in a Coryneform; (2) a DNA region containing a drug 
resistance gene which can be used as a plasmid marker; and (3)  
 
a DNA region encoding a gene required for replication in 
Escherichia coli. Unfortunately, when a gene encoding a useful 
biological product is inserted into pCRY3 and the plasmid is 
subsequently inserted into a Coryneform, the biologically 
useful product is not produced in high levels. Production is low because the amount of biological product 
produced is approximately proportional to the copy number of 
the plasmid vector and the copy number of pCRY3 in a Coryneform 
is only 4 to 6. Accordingly, a plasmid which exhibits a high copy number in 
a Coryneform is desirabe so that when a gene encoding a 
biologically useful product is inserted into the plasmid 
vector, higher gene dosage effect (in other words, higher 
expression) of the useful gene can be expected. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to 
provide a DNA fragment which encodes a gene which allows said 
plasmid to replicate autonomously in a Coryneform such that 
when said DNA fragment is incorporated into a plasmid, it 
imparts the ability for said plasmid to exist in a Coryneform 
in high copy number. A second object of the present invention is to provide a 
plasmid containing said DNA fragment. A third
