<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electronically commutated electrical machine, in particular, a motor, with a stator (30), comprising main teeth (34), divided by grooves (33) and with a stator winding (37), produced with insulated winding wire (38), comprising k winding phases (41 - 44) each with l parallel branches (45) of m coils (40) in series, wound around the main teeth (34) and inserted in the grooves (33). The invention further comprises contact hooks (39), connected to the l parallel branches of each winding phase (41 - 44), which form the phase terminals (B1, B2, A2, A1) and star points (SB, SA) for each of the winding phases (41 - 44). According to the invention, the winding wire path around the winding support may be optimised, whereby a part of the l parallel branches (45) of the one winding phase (41 - 44) makes contact with the star point (SA, SB) of another winding phase (44 - 41).
