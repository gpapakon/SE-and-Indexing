<ABSTRACT>
To prevent the oscillation which often occurs in an over current protection device for an 
insulated gate controlled transistor, an over current protection device is provided which 

improves the response in current detection to prevent the oscillation and improves protection 
speed against over current by 


separating the gates of a main transistor (10) and a current detector transistor (20); 
setting the time constant for the gate circuit of the detector transistor (20) shorter than that 
of the gate circuit of the main transistor (10); 
feeding a detection signal (Vd), obtained with current detecting means (Rd) which detects the 
current (i) of the detector transistor (20) proportional to the current (l) flowing through the 

main transistor (10), to control means (50); and 
 
controlling the transistors (10, 20) to protect the transistor (10) from the over current by 

feeding the comparison output Sd from a comparator circuit (30), which compares the voltage 
of the detection signal (Vd) with a reference voltage (Vr), to the control circuit (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an over current protection device for an insulated gate
controlled transistor such as a power MOS transistor, an insulated gate bipolar transistor, etc..Since the input impedance of insulated gate controlled transistors is very high, since power
MOS transistors are applicable in a high frequency range and since insulated gate bipolar
transistors, the output impedance of which is very low, are well suited for large current
applications, these insulated gate controlled transistors are widely used in a form of a vertical
element in a switching power supply, an inverter for controlling a motor, etc..However, a power transistor requires some protection measures against an over current since
the power transistor is damaged or broken down rather easily by an over current caused by an
abnormality on the load side. In these days, the protection measures have been incorporated
into an integrated circuit together with related circuits. A protection scheme has been known
which incorporates a current detector transistor as an over current protection means with a
main transistor and executes protection by detecting an over current flowing through the main
transistor on the basis of the principle of the Miller's current circuit. This protection scheme is
described, for example, in Electro mini/micro Northeast Conf. Rec. E 10.4.1-10.4.4., 1986 by
D. L. Zaremba Jr. and in the US Patent No. 4,783,690. Figure 6 schematically shows the
protection technique according to this prior art.In Fig. 6, a load power supply 2 supplies voltage of typically several hundreds of volts to a load
1. A main transistor 10 which controls a current flowing through the load 1 is a power MOS
transistor, the drain terminal D of which is connected with the load 1 and the source terminal S
of which is grounded. The main transistor 10 is usually comprised of many unit structures
connected in parallel with each other and incorporated into a semiconductor device. A current
detector transistor 20 is comprised of from one to several unit structures, assigned to the
current detection purpose, having the same unit structure with the unit structure of the main
transistor 10 and being incorporated into the semiconductor device. As Fig. 6 shows, the drain
and the gate of the current detector transistor 20 are connected in common to the drain
and the gate of the main transistor 10, respectively. The common gate receives a drive
command Ss from a drive circuit 3. Usually, a gate resistor Rg is connected as shown in Fig. 6
