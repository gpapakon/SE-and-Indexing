<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alloy which can
electrochemically absorb and desorb hydrogen in a reversible
manner. It also relates to an electrode using said alloy.Storage batteries, which are widely used as power
sources in a variety of applications, are typically classified
into two general groups: lead storage batteries and alkaline
storage batteries. Between the two groups, alkaline storage
batteries tend to be more reliable, and can be made smaller
and lighter. Small alkaline batteries are generally favored
for portable electric appliances, while large alkaline
batteries have been used mainly in conjunction with industrial
equipment.While some alkaline storage batteries use, for
example, silver oxide or simply air for their positive
electrode, more commonly the positive electrode is nickel.
Nickel electrodes have been particularly popular since they
were reconfigured from a pocket type to a sintered type, and
became even more popular with the development of hermetic-sealing.
Cadmium is most commonly used to form the negative
electrode of alkaline storage batteries, however other
materials, including zinc, iron, hydrogen, and the like have
also been employed. There is considerable commercial interest in storage
batteries that have a higher energy density than batteries
currently available. By "energy density" is meant the product
of the battery capacity and the battery voltage per unit
weight or volume, usually represented by Wh/kg or Wh/l.
Toward achieving this goal, researchers have investigated
nickel-hydrogen storage batteries which incorporate hydrogen
storage electrodes. The alloys in these electrodes, or the
hydride form of such alloys which form upon the absorption of
hydrogen by the alloys, can absorb and desorb hydrogen in a
reversible manner, and thus the alloys and the electrodes made
from these alloys have come to be known as hydrogen storage
alloys and hydrogen storage electrodes (or hydrogen storage
alloy electrodes), respectively.Batteries made with hydrogen storage electrodes have
a larger theoretical capacity density compared to batteries
formed with cadmium electrodes. By "capacity density" is
meant the discharge capacity per unit weight or unit volume of
an alloy, usually represented by mAh/g or mAh/cc. Also,
batteries that employ hydrogen storage electrodes are not
susceptible to the formation of dendrites, which is a problem
with zinc electrodes that can cause a battery to short-circuit.
These advantageous properties, as well as the
promise of a longer cycle life and a
