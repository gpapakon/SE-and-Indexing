<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interframe 
adaptive vector quantization encoding apparatus which 
performs encoding of video signals at high efficiency 
using vector quantization, and also to a video encoding 
transmission apparatus which transmits the encoding 
signals. First, principle of the vector quantization 
will be described briefly. The input signal series of K 
in number are brought together into input vector 
X = {x₁, x₂, ... xK}. Then, the K-dimensional Euclidean 
signal space Rk(X∈Rk) has the representative points of 
N in number (i.e., output vector) yi = {yi1, yi2, ... yik}, 
and set of the representative points is made  
 
Y = [y₁, y₂, ... yN]. The vector quantizer determines 
output vector yi as hereinafter described from the set of 
output vectors, and retrieves it. The output vector yi 
is in the minimum distance (minimum distortion) to the 
input vector, and it follows that:

if, d(X,yi)<d(X,yj) for alljX → yi


 
wherein, d(X, yi) represents distance (distortion) between 
input/output vectors. Then, the input vector X is 
transmitted or recorded in index i of the output vector. 
At reproduction, set Y of the output vector yi can be 
determined by clustering using the video signal series 
being the training model (repetition of the selection of 
the representative points and the quantization of the 
training model into each representative point until the 
total distortion becoming minimum). Furthermore, in 
order to improve efficiency of the vector quantization 
and versatility of the output vector set, the vector 
quantization may be performed at separation of the mean 
value of vectors and the normalization in amplitude. An interframe adaptive vector quantization 
apparatus in the prior art will be described. Fig. 2 is a block diagram of an interframe  
 
adaptive vector quantization apparatus in the prior art 
illustrating a constitution example of an encoding 
member thereof. In Fig. 2, numeral 1 designates an A/D 
converter, numeral 2 a raster/block scan conversion 
circuit where digital video signals in raster form by the 
A/D conversion are made a block per every m picture 
elements x n lines (m, n: integer), numeral 3 a vector 
quantization encoder which encodes the block data at high 
efficiency by means of vector quantization, numeral 4 a 
transmission data buffer where the encoded data at high 
efficiency is stored and transmitted to the transmission 
path at constant speed, numeral 5 a movement detection 
control circuit which controls threshold value of movement 
det
