<ABSTRACT>
The invention includes a method and apparatus 
for applying a single or multiple layer coating material 

to a substrate (30) using a generally cylindrical 
application roller (26). First and second coating 

materials are extruded and join together to form a 
multiple layer coating material. Additional layers may be 

similarly provided if desired. The multiple layer coating 
material may then be transferred on the peripheral surface 

(24) of the application roller to a substrate, such as 
paper. The application roller may be rotated to produce a 

surface velocity that is greater than the velocity of the 
extruded multiple layer coating material, to draw the 

material and provide a thin multiple coating layer. 
Furthermore, the substrate may be conveyed past the 

application interface at a velocity greater than the 
surface velocity of the application roller, to provide 

further drawing of the multiple layer coating material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
coating two or more layers of a coating material onto a receiving surface, 
such as a substrate. Coating materials such as hot-melt adhesives and radiation curable 
adhesives may be applied to a substrate, such as paper, by one of several 
different methods. For example, direct die coating is a method that involves 
the extrusion of a flowable coating material through one or more die 
openings onto a substrate. As shown in Figure 1, a substrate 1 is driven from 
supply roll 2 past die coater 3 and to takeup roll 4. The die coater applies one 
or more layers of coating material (two, in the illustrated embodiment) 
directly onto the substrate. Such a method may be used to provide an adhesive 
layer onto a web of paper or polymeric film. Additionally, JP 4027462 describes a method of coating a web with a 
desired amount of a coating liquid with a uniform profile by dropping the 
coating liquid on the surface of a rotating roll in the form of a curtain and 
bringing the web into contact with a uniform layer of the coating liquid 
formed on the surface of the roll. FR-A-1 359 975 describes a method of preparing a complex sheet 
made of a substrate, an intermediate thermoplastic layer, a thermoplastic 
coating layer both intermediate and coating layers are continuously applied 
in a liquid form on the substrate. EP-A-31 301 describes a method wherein a continuous strip of 
photographic material is coated with a photographic layer by passing the 
strip between two rollers. One roller has a flexible surface whilst the other 
has a highly burnished surface. The two rollers are pressed together with a 
force of between 5 and 50 kg per cm of width. The burnished roller is driven 
by a motor and drives the strip whilst the flexible roller is free running. The viscous photographic coating material is supplied from an 
extruder in a thin band directed towards the point where the film strip 
contacts the burnished roller, which is cooled to between 0°C and 10°C to  
 
prevent adhesion of the coating. The film strip travels at between twice and 
fifty times the speed of the extruded coating so that the coating is stretched 
and reduced in thickness from 300 to only 2 micrometres. Gravure coating is another known method of applying a coating 
material to a substrate. In gravure coating, an applicator roller is used to 
receive and transfer the coating material to a substrate. The applicator roller 
includes a predetermined pattern of engraved depressions, or cells, formed
