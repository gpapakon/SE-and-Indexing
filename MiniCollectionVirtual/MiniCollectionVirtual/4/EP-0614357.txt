<DESCRIPTION>
 IMMUNOPOTENTIATORY AGENTSThis invention relates to the use of a class of compounds as immunopotentiators, compositions containing such compounds and their manufacture, combinations of such compounds with anti-tumour or anti-infective drugs and the use of such combinations in the prophylaxis or treatment of such diseases associated with tumours or infections.The principal protective function of the immune system relates to resistance to invasion by pathogens, including viruses, rickettsia, mycoplasma, bacteria, fimgi and parasites of all types. Thus, improvement of immune response, particularly when depressed, enhances resistance to infection or infestation by any of the above pathogens.A second protective function of the immune system is to resist engraftment of foreign tissue, either natural or in a foetal-maternal relationship; or unnatural as performed by the transplant physician.A further protective function of the immune system is thought to be resistance to malignant cell development as in cancer. Immunopotentiators are used in cancer to enhance tumour rejection and to inhibit tumour recurrences following other forms of therapy.Yet another protective function involves maintaining non-reactivity to self by positive suppressor mechanisms. In auto-immune and related disorders, immune reactivity, directed at self-antigens or exaggerated, elevated responses, are apparent and self destructive.Each of the protective functions of the immune system can be modified by nonspecific therapy with immunopotentiators alone or in combination with other agents employed to improve resistance to or to kill the invading pathogen. In addition, specific resistance can be augmented by use of immunopotentiators in conjunction with an antigen as in a vaccine employing, for example, a virus, tumour cells, etc. This use can be to induce either specific immunity or tolerance. The latter is exemplified by use with an antigen in allergy or an auto-immune disease. Use of immunopotentiators may be either therapeutic or prophylactic; the latter is used particularly in aging, where infection, auto-immunity, and cancer are more common. The timing and route ofSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

administration are critical in determining whether a positive or negative response results. Any agent capable of augmenting an immune response may inhibit it depending on timing and dose; thus, under certain circumstances an immunopotentiator could be used as an immunosuppressive agent for use in allergy, auto-immunity and transplantation.By immunopotentiator
