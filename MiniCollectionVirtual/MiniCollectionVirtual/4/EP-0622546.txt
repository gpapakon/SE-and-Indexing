<ABSTRACT>
In a high side rotary compressor (10), 
interior shell pressure is used to force lubricant from 

the sump (36) into the compression chamber. The 
lubricant is delivered only after the suction port has 

closed and before chamber pressure exceeds shell 
pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
In a fixed vane or rolling piston compressor, the 
vane is biased into contact with the roller or piston. The 
roller or piston is carried by an eccentric on the 
crankshaft and tracks along the cylinder in a line contact 
such that the piston and cylinder coact to define a 
crescent shaped space. The space rotates about the axis of 
the crankshaft and is divided into a suction chamber and a 
compression chamber by the vane coacting with the piston. 
In a vertical, high side compressor an oil pickup tube 
extends into the oil sump and is rotated with the 
crankshaft thereby causing oil to be distributed to the 
locations requiring lubricant. A rolling compressor of the 
above type on which the two-part form of independent claim 
1 is based is disclosed in US-A-3,565,552. The known 
compressor has means for supplying lubricant from the oil 
sump which is at compressor discharge pressure into the 
vane slot formed in the cylinder body of the compressor. In 
one embodiment lubricant is supplied from the oil sump to 
lubricant ducts on opposite sides of the vane and in 
another embodiment to a spring chamber at the radial outer 
end of the vane. In the case of variable speed operation, 
for example, there may be an inadequate distribution of 
oil. An area of sensitivity to inadequate lubrication is 
the line contact between the vane and piston and can cause 
excessive wear. Reference is also made to US-A-4,331,002 which 
discloses injection of uncondensed gaseous refrigerant from 
the inlet end of an evaporator into the compression chamber 
through an injection port covered and uncovered by the 
piston during rotation thereof. This lowers the evaporator 
inlet pressure resulting in a more efficient evaporator and 
provides a more efficient or larger displacement compressor 
for the same compression chamber volume. In a high side vertical rolling piston compressor 
the interior of the shell is at discharge pressure and 
therefore the pressure over the oil sump is at discharge  
 
pressure. Between the beginning of the compression stroke 
and the beginning of the discharge stroke, the trapped 
volume defined by the cylinder, piston and vane goes from 
suction pressure to discharge pressure. Particularly in the 
case of variable speed compressors, the lubrication 
provided by the conventional centrifugal pump structure can 
vary with operating conditions. It is an object of this invention to maintain a 
stable oil film between the piston and vane. It is a further object of this invention to provide 
auxiliary
