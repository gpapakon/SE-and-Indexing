<ABSTRACT>
The tube framework of the piece of furniture exhibits visible surfaces which are formed exclusively by tubes (1) and, if appropriate, filling bodies (2), which do not exhibit any open joints, depressions or holes in which dirt can collect and which are difficult to clean. The piece of furniture is thus suitable especially for purposes in which a particular degree of cleanliness and hygiene is required, for example for furniture for doctors or for laboratory furniture. Filling panels (12) are inserted into the tube framework of the piece of furniture, likewise without open joints and/or with seals (13, 14, 15).
