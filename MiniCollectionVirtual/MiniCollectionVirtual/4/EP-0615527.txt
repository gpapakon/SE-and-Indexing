<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns aramid block copolymers
containing two different types of blocks of aramids, one
that is crystalline and one that is noncrystalline after
drawing, both blocks being flexible in solution and
before drawing, but becoming relatively rigid after
drawing. Also disclosed is a process for making such
aramid block copolymers.Block copolymers in general are known to those
skilled in the art, and have been made using many
different types of polymers for the blocks. Block
copolymers are often made in the hope of obtaining a
combination of the desirable properties characteristic
of each block, but the outcome is usually not
predictable. Some aramid block copolymers have been
previously reported.A. Ya. Yakubovich, et al., Vysokomol. Soyed.,
vol. A14, p. 1838-184 (1972), report the synthesis of
various aramid block copolymers. It is believed all of
these blocks remain flexible whether drawn or not. Most
of these block copolymers were made by preforming both
types of blocks and then reacting to combine them into a
block copolymer.In a series of papers, W. R. Krigbaum and coworkers
investigated the synthesis and properties of several
aramid block copolymers. All of these block copolymer
contained one type of block that was always flexible,
and another type of block that was rigid in solution
and/or without drawing. The first of these papers
[J. Polym. Sci., Part A, Polym. Chem., vol. 25,
p. 653-667 (1987)] describes the synthesis of the 
polymers, and in all of the methods used, the authors
report varying amounts of homopolymer due to inability
to completely couple the blocks into a block copolymer.
The second [J. Polym. Sci., Part B, Polym. Phy.,
vol. 25, p. 1043-1055 (1987)] and third [Polym. J.,
vol. 20, p. 83-91 (1988)] papers describe properties of
these aramid block copolymers. The fourth paper
[J. Polym. Sci., Part C, Polym. Lett., vol. 27 p. 59-63
(1989)] reports an improved synthesis using a
phosphorylation reaction, which gives more efficient
coupling of the aramid blocks.Japanese Patent Application 51/041097 describes the
preparation of aramid block copolymers. None of these
is believed to contain an aramid block that contains
flexible chains in solution and the undrawn state, that
become rigid upon drawing. The polymers are reported to
be made by preforming one block as a suspension of a
solid in liquid, and then adding the monomers that form
the second block.This invention concerns an aramid block copolymer
derived from aromatic diacid(s) and aromatic diamine(s)
comprising two or
