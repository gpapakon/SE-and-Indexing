<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a device for obtaining the skin from fish fillets. The device comprises a driven delivery surface (6, 8, 10) and a skinning cutter with a press-on surface (11) arranged behind the cutting edge (4). The delivery surface (6, 8, 10) is provided with a granular corundum coating, which, due to the multiplicity of points of contact between the delivery surface and the skin, ensures a separating operation which is gentle on the surface of the skin.

<CLAIMS>
Device for obtaining the skin of fish fillets comprising a driven conveying surface (6,
8, 10) supporting the skin side, a skinning knife with cutting a edge (4) arranged at a

spacing relative to the skinning surface, as well as a presser surface (11) disposed behind
the cutting edge (4) in the movement direction of the conveying surface (6, 8, 10) and

leaving a gap to the conveying surface, characterised thereby that the conveying surface
(6, 8, 10) is formed by a grained mineral structure.
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the conveying surface (6,
8, 10) is formed by a corundum deposit.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the conveying surface
(6) is formed by the circumferential surface of a roller (2).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the conveying surface
(8) is formed by an endless belt which is driven to circulate and is deflected around at least

two deflecting rollers (2, 9), wherein the skinning knife and the presser surface (11) are
arranged in the looping region of the deflecting roller (2).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the conveying surface

(10) is formed by an endless conveyor belt which simultaneously serves as a feed
conveyor (1) and which is deflected around the deflecting roller (2), wherein the skinning

knife and the presser surface (11) are arranged in the looping region of the deflecting roller
(2).
