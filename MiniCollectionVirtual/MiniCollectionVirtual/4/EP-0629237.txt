A device for the mass culture of cells, especially 
hepatocytes, on cell culture slides, at least a 

part of the surface of the cell culture slides 
being gas-permeable,
 
characterised in that oxygen can be introduced inside 

the plate-like cell culture slides (1), and 
in that a collagen layer (5,7) covering the cells 

is applied to the cell culture slide (1), the next 
cell culture slide (1) being disposed directly or 

a slight distance above the collagen layer (5,7) 
and it being possibl
e to introduce culture medium 
into the collagen layer (5,7) or into the space 

between the collagen layer (5,7) and the next cell 
culture slide (1). 
A device according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the cell culture (6) is disposed 

on a first collagen layer (5), and in that a 
second, upper collagen layer (7) lies over the 

cell culture (6). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that a space (9) for the supply 

of culture medium is provided between two collagen 
layers (7,7') or between a collagen layer (5') and 

the under side of a cell culture slide (1').  
 
A device according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
 
characterised in that a second cell culture (8) is 

disposed on the first cell culture (6). 
A device according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that the second cell culture (8) 

is formed from non-parenchymal cells. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that the cell culture slides (1) 

are formed from sintered metal. 
A device according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that each cell culture slide (1) 

is formed from an upper and a lower gas-permeable 
layer or strip (1A), which are separated from one 

another by spacers. 
A device according to claim 7,
 
characterised in that the layer (1A) is formed 

from sintered metal. 
A device according to claim 7,
 
characterised in that the cell culture slides (1) 

are formed from a gas-permeable plastic or comprise 
a gas-permeable plastic. 
A device according to claim 9,
 
characterised in that the cell culture slides (1) 

are formed from a supporting frame (24,25,26), 
on or over which a gas-permeable membrane is 

stretched. 
A device according to claim 10,
  
 

characterised in that the supporting frame consists 
of an outer annular member (24) and an inner 

annular member (25) surrounding the central bore 
(3), both annular members (24,25) being connected 

to one another by spoke-shaped ribs (26). 
A device according to claim 11,
 
characterised in that the supply appertures (4) 

for oxygen are disposed in at least a part of the 
ribs (26), and in that air ducts (27) are provided 

in the ribs (26). 
A device according to one of claims 9 to 12,
 
characterised in that the gas-permeable surfaces 

are formed by a silicon or polypropylene film. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 13,
 
characterised in that sealing rings (10) used as 

spacers and/or for sealing are disposed between 
the individual cell culture slides (1). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 14,
 
characterised in that it is constructed in modular 

fashion with a plurality of cell culture slides 
(1) disposed above one another in a housing, 

having at least one supply line (23) for oxygen 
and having at least one inlet line (18) and at 

least one outlet line (17) for culture medium. 
A device according to claim 15,
 
characterised in that the cell culture slides (1) 

have at least roughly a disc shape, the supply of 
culture medium occurring on the peripheral side 

and the discharge occurring from the central region  
 

of the cell culture slides (1) provided with 
a free space at this place, and in that each cell 

culture slide (1) is provided with at least two 
supply apertures (4) for oxygen disposed uniformly 

over the circumference of the cell culture slides 
(1). 
A device according to claim 15 or 16,
 
characterised in that each cell culture slide (1) 

is provided with a central bore (3), and in that a 
cone (15) tapering in the discharge direction, 

which has such a diameter that an annular space to 
the walls of the central bores (3) of the cell 

culture slides (1) remains, is disposed through 
the central bores. 
A device according to one of claims 15 to 17,
 
characterised in that the cell culture slides (1) 

are connected to one another to form a unit by a 
tensioning device (12,13) extending through the 

oxygen supply apertures (4). 
A device according to claim 18,
 
characterised in that the oxygen supply apertures 

(4) have a circular construction and the tensioning 
device has a guide rod (12) deviating from 

the circular shape, through the interior of which 
a straining screw is placed. 
A device according to one of claims 15 to 19,
 
characterised in that several towers formed from 

cell culture slides (1) are disposed in cloverleaf 
fashion next to one another.  

 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 20,
 
characterised in that the nutrient medium is circulated 

via a collecting basin (19) and a pump 
(20). 
A device according to claim 21,
 
characterised in that a filter device is provided 

in the circulation for substances to be collected.
