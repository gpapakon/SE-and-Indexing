<ABSTRACT>
A monolithic switching regulator includes an operational 
amplifier which is provided with a small frequency 

compensation capacitor, which determines the amplifiers 
unity gain frequency. The non-inverting input is driven at 

a frequency that is below its unity gain frequency and 
presents a capacitance having a value of the order of 

nanofarads, which value would ordinarily require an 
excessive chip area if fabricated as an actual capacitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to switching voltage regulators
constituted as integrated circuits.A capacitance multiplier circuit is known from EP-A-0,139,230 (Villinger) in which an operational amplifier connected as a voltage follower also has a complex impedance connected in series with the input. The overall capacitance of the circuit is much greater than the value of the capacitor used in the complex impedance.It is an object of the invention to incorporate the
frequency compensation components of a switching regulator
within the integrated circuit.It is a further or alternative object of the invention to
create a virtual compensation capacitor in an integrated
circuit in which a capacitance multiplier produces a large
effective capacitance which can serve as a switching
regulator frequency compensation element. The invention provides a capacitance multiplying circuit for
use on an integrated circuit chip for providing a relatively
large on-chip capacitance useful in loop frequency
compensation functions, said circuit comprising an
operational amplifier having inverting and non-inverting
inputs, a single ended output and an open-loop unity gain at
a particular frequency; a resistive connection between the
inverting and non-inverting inputs; means for coupling the
output of the operational amplifier to its inverting input;
and means for driving the non-inverting input at a frequency
that is below the said particular frequency whereby a
relatively large equivalent shunt capacitance is present at
the said non-inverting input. In a preferred embodiment, a switching regulator is operated
at a relatively high switching frequency and incorporates an
error amplifier that requires a relatively large
compensation capacitor. An operational amplifier has its
output connected to its inverting input and includes a first
resistor connected across its input terminals. A second
resistor couples the non-inverting input of the operational
amplifier to the regulator's error amplifier output. The
non-inverting input presents an equivalent capacitance
inversely proportional to the value of the first resistor
multiplied by unity gain frequency of the operational
amplifier. This produces a substantial capacitance as an
on-chip component and the second resistor provides a series
resistor loop compensation component. The equivalent
capacitor and the second resistor in series represent the
frequency compensating element of the whole switching
regulator. Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram of one example of a
known voltage
