<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the production of 
an aluminum nitride sintered body and, more particularly, 
relates to an unsintered aluminum nitride body and a method 
for forming such body followed by sintering so as to produce 
an aluminum nitride sintered body having a high density and 
satisfactory thermal conductivity by sintering at a 
temperature lower than that in conventional techniques. Aluminum nitride has been of interest recently for 
electronic packaging applications because of its high thermal 
conductivity, thermal expansion matching with silicon, low 
dielectric constant (8.5) and high electrical resistivity. Production of an aluminum nitride sintered body having 
excellent thermal conductivity requires forming of aluminum 
nitride powder followed by sintering to achieve a dense body. Since aluminum nitride by itself is difficult to sinter 
under atmospheric pressure, pressureless sintering of 
aluminum nitride has conventionally been carried out with the 
aid of additive sintering aids. For example, Takeshima et al. Japanese Kokai J04-154,670 
discloses dense, sintered aluminum nitride bodies which have 
been achieved by the use of alumina and calcia additions. Most of the additives proposed previously are highly 
refractory materials, and remain in the solid state during  
 
the early stage of sintering. During the course of 
sintering, some of them eventually form a liquid phase by 
reacting with any aluminum oxide present, either by 
intentional addition or with the aluminum oxide impurity in 
aluminum nitride. The liquid phase thus formed has been 
reported to aid densification of aluminum nitride. 
However, because of the refractory nature of these additives, 
the temperature required for sintering aluminum nitride has 
been exceptionally high (1800-2000 degrees Centigrade) 
compared to the sintering temperature of 1500-1600 degrees 
Centigrade for alumina. Others have proposed lower melting additives such as 
boria in addition to calcia and alumina. Nakano et al. 
Japanese Kokai J02-275,769 discloses adding additions of 
aluminum, calcia and boria to aluminum nitride powder, 
followed by sintering at 1400-2000 degrees Centigrade. 
However, to achieve a fully dense body having a thermal 
conductivity of 192 W/m-K, the compositions were sintered at 
1800 degrees Centigrade for 4 hours. Sawamura, et al., 
Japanese Kokai J62-176,961 discloses additions or mixtures of 
alumina, calcia and boria (as well as others) to aluminum 
nitride to achieve a sintered body. In one
