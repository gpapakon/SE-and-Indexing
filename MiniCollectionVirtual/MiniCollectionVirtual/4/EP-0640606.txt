<ABSTRACT>
A thienopyrimidie derivative of the formula: 

wherein each of R¹ and R² is hydrogen or an optionally-substituted 
hydrocarbon residue; R³ is hydrogen or a group which 

is bonded through a carbon atom or nitrogen atom; R⁴ is an 
optionally-substituted hydrocarbon residue; W is a chemical bond 

or a connecting group and n is an integer of 1-3, or a salt 
thereof has potent endothelin antagonist activity, thus being used 

for treating or preventing acute renal insufficiency, myocardial 
infarction, liver insufficiency, angina pectoris, cerebral 

infarction, sub-arachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), hypertension, renal 
insufficiency, asthma, variant form of angina, Raynaud's syndrome, 

pulmonary hypertension, surgery shock, chronic cardiac 
insufficiency, cardiac hypertrophy, arteriosclerosis, migraine and 

the like, furthermore, for treating or preventing a hypofunction 
of an organ (e.g. liver, etc.) caused by its surgery or 

transplant, insufficient microcirculation, still fruthermore, for 
preventing restenosis after PTCA.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to endothelin antagonists
containing thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives, to thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine
derivatives and to methods of manufacturing them.The participation of endothelin has been suggested in adult
diseases which have been increasing in recent years, particularly
in those which are caused by ischemia such as cerebral infarction,
angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and renal insufficiency.
Endothelin is a peptide comprising 21 amino acids produced by
endothelial cells and endothelin-1, endothelin-2 from which
endothelin-3 have been obtained. In this specification, a group
comprising these endothelins will be referred to as "endothelin".It has been reported that endothelin exhibits the most
powerful and long-lasting vasoconstrictive action, hypertensive
activity and potentiating action for contraction of heart muscles
among the natural and synthetic substances which were known
hitherto. Such actions of the peptide have been thought to be due
to the endothelin receptors which are thought to be present in
smooth muscle membranes of the blood vessel and others. With
regard to the endothelin receptors, endothelin-A receptor and
endothelin-B receptor have been known. Hereinafter, they will be
referred to as "endothelin receptors".Accordingly, compounds having affinity for endothelin
receptors while showing endothelin antagonistic activity have
prophylactic and therapeutic effects against diseases which are 
caused by ischemia such as cerebral infarction, angina pectoris,
myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency and liver insufficiency
and thus development of these compounds has been greatly expected.
With respect to compounds having an endothelin antagonistic
action prepared by means of synthesis, those which are disclosed
in the EP-A-510526 and 526708 and the WO-A-93/08799 have
been known. However, the degree of endothelin antagonistic action
of these compounds has not been satisfactory.
EP 0 404 525 relates to sulfur-containing fused pyrimidine
derivatives, their production and use.An object of the present invention is to offer endothelin
antagonists containing thienopyrimidine derivatives exhibiting an
excellent endothelin antago3nistic action, novel thienopyrimidine
derivatives and methods of manufacturing them.Under the above-mentioned circumstances, the present
inventors have carried out extensive investigations in order to
find novel compounds which can be used as endothelin antagonists
and found that the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives exhibit an
