<ABSTRACT>
A pilot signal is superposed and recorded on data at 
the beginning of each track. The beginning part of the 

track is constituted by using only codewords of which disparity 
in every 10 bits is +2, 0 or -2. The beginning part 

of track is also constituted so that the cumulative value of 
the disparities of ev
ery 10 bits may increase or decrease in 
the period of the pilot signal to be superposed. Therefore, 

the frequency spectrum in the beginning part of the track 
has a peak at the frequency of pilot signal, and using this 

peak as pilot signal, tracking is controlled in reproduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording method in
high density magnetic recording apparatus such as a digital
recording video cassette recorder (digital VCR).Presently is promoted the study on the digital VCR for
recording sound and picture by digital signals of 0 and 1
for the purpose of higher picture quality and higher sound
quality. In particular, video signals contain plenty of
information, and to record them for a long time, high density
recording for recording plenty of information on a tape
is indispensable. Two methods are attempted at present for
high density recording. A first method is to shorten a
length necessary for recording one bit,which is a method of
enhancing a so-called line density. A second method is to 
narrow a track width.To enhance the line density, hitherto, improvement was
promoted from a viewpoint of recording material and signal
processing, and about 0.25 µm of the line density is realized
for recording one bit. On the other hand, the tracking
width is said to be limited around 10 µm in a VCR from a
viewpoint of mechanical precision in recording and reproducing,
and tracking control for obtaining a stable reproduced
output. In an 8 mm VCR, a pilot signal is superposed and
recorded in video signals and audio signals for the purpose
of tracking control.In the case of the digital VCR for recording video signals
and audio signals by digital signals, a quantity of
information to be recorded is very large as compared with
that of an analog VCR. That is, the technology of high
density recording is more required than that of the analog
VCR.In the digital VCR, a recording signal band is much
wider than in the analog VCR, and it is difficult to assign
a frequency for pilot signals in other frequency band than a 
signal to be recorded as in the 8 mm VCR. It is thus required
to assign a pilot signal frequency within the frequency
band of signal to be recorded. Besides, to realize a
narrow track width, it is needed to raise a ratio of a
amplification level of the pilot signal to a noise level of
the pilot signal.However, when the amplification level of the pilot
signal is increased, an amplitude of other signal than an
original signal to be recorded is also increased, and the
pilot signal disturbs when reproducing, and an error rate of
judging each bit whether 1 or 0 becomes higher. Accordingly,
if attempted to superpose other signal than a signal to
be recorded as the pilot signal, an amplitude of the pilot
signal cannot be increased. If the amplitude of the pilot
signal cannot

A data recording method for recording digital data on a plurality of
parallel tracks formed on a recording medium (412), each of said tracks having an

insert information recording region provided at the beginning of the track and
audio and video data recording regions, said method comprising the steps of:


recording (411) at least one of audio data and video data on said audio
and video recording regions of a track on the recording medium (412);
generating (406) a plurality of ID codewords such that the cumulative
value of the disparity which is defined as a difference in the number of 1's and 0's

in every n bits varies periodically to generate a pilot signal which will be used for
tracking control;
recording (411) the generated ID codewords into the insert information
recording region of the track on the recording medium,

   characterized in that the step of generating the plurality of ID codewords
includes the step of:


converting an m-bit data block into a 2m-bit data block by once
repeating each bit of the m-bit data block,
2T pre-coding the m-bit data block with an initial bit value of 01 or 10
to obtain a (2m+2)-bit data block beginning with said initial bit value, and
adding k dummy bits to the (2m+2)-bit data block to obtain an ID
codeword having 2m+2+k bits, wherein the k dummy bits have a disparity

between a total number of 1 bits and a total number of 0 bits which is +i, 0, or -i.
A data recording method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a cumulative
value of the disparity of each 2m+2+k; bits of the insert information varies from

zero to a peak value and back to zero in a period which corresponds to a period of
the pilot signal. 
A data recording method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein a
frequency of the pilot signal is 1/90, 1/60 or 1/40 of a recording frequency of the

audio data and the video data.
A data recording method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein
2m+2+k equals 10, and wherein the period of the cumulative value of the

disparities of the insert information is 90 bits, 60 bits or 40 bits.
