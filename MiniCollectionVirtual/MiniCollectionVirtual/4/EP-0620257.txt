<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiation curable 
poly(α-olefin) compositions providing adhesives having 
a superior balance of peel adhesion and cohesive 
strength at both ambient and elevated temperatures. A continuing need in the pressure-sensitive 
adhesive (PSA) art is the achievement of better control 
over various mechanical and process properties so that 
adhesives can be made specifically for highly demanding 
end use applications such as packaging, medical, and 
masking tapes. These applications require a proper 
balance of properties that changes with the particular 
end use. Among the earliest polymers to provide a 
reasonable balance of the properties required for 
satisfactory PSA performance were the natural and 
synthetic rubbers. However, these PSAs had poor aging 
properties, and the art quickly recognized the need to 
eliminate ethylenically unsaturated groups from the 
polymer backbone of rubber adhesives in order to 
improve their oxidative stability. The discovery of Ziegler-Natta (ZN) catalysts made 
possible polymerization of α-olefin monomers to high 
molecular weights. The homopolymers of the C6-C10 
α-olefins were naturally tacky and also had low 
toxicity, good aging and favorable environmental 
stability (i.e., low oxidation). These homopolymers 
were chemically inert, resistant to plasticizer 
migration, and relatively inexpensive. However, they 
had poor cohesive strength and therefore, lacked the 
shear adhesion necessary for high performance PSAs. 
Use of ZN catalysts to make homopolymers from α-olefin 
monomers and to make copolymers from mixtures of α-olefin 
and nonconjugated polyene monomers is known in  
 
the art and is succinctly summarized in Odian, G., 
"Principles of Polymerization", Ch. 8.4 (Second Edition 
J. Wiley & Sons, New York, 1981). For a more detailed 
discussion of the polymerization of α-olefins, see 
Boor, J., "Ziegler-Natta Catalysts and 
Polymerizations", Ch. 19 (Academic Press, NY, 1979). Adhesives derived primarily from C6 or higher 
α-olefins are also known. U.S. Patent No. 3,542,717 
describes poly(α-olefin) adhesive compositions 
comprising mixtures of polyolefin copolymers derived 
from olefin monomers with different molecular weights 
(i.e., copolymers from one α-olefin monomer having 11 
to 20 carbon atoms and another having 4 to 20 carbon 
atoms.) U.S. Patent No. 3,635,755 describes polyolefin 
PSAs suitable for use as a single component PSA for 
surgical tapes that are substantially non-allergenic. 
Such adhesives can be made from
