<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a process for the 
preparation of hydrolyzable β-cyanoalkylsilanes. More 

particularly, this invention relates to the catalytic 
addition of trichlorosilane to α,β-unsaturated olefinic 

nitriles to form β-cyanoalkylsilanes. The present process 
employs a catalyst comprising a ruthenium compound. The 

preferred catalyst for the present process is a ruthenium 
compound having at least one tertiary phosphine ligand. The 

process is conducted at a temperature within a range of 50°C. 
to 300°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a process for the
preparation of hydrolyzable β-cyanoalkylsilanes. More
particularly, this invention relates to the catalytic
addition of trichlorosilane to α,β-unsaturated olefinic
nitriles to form β-cyanoalkylsilanes. The present process
employs a catalyst comprising a ruthenium compound. The
preferred catalyst for the present process is a ruthenium
compound having at least one tertiary phosphine ligand.
The process is conducted at a temperature within a range of
50 to 300°C.Beta-cyanoalkylsilanes having hydrolyzable
chlorines bonded to the silicon atom are useful for the
production of polyorganosiloxanes containing the β-cyanoalkyl
substituent. The silicon-bonded β-cyanoalkyl substituent is
extremely resistant to hydrolysis and cleavage under hot,
humid conditions and imparts these characteristics to the
polyorganosiloxane of which they are a substituent. The
presence of the silicon bonded β-cyanoalkyl substituent on
polyorganosiloxanes also tends to stabilize the
polyorganosiloxanes against swelling induced by liquid
hydrocarbons. In addition, β-cyanoalkylsilanes having
hydrolyzable chlorines are useful reactive intermediates for
forming, for example, gamma-organoaminotrialkoxysilanes which
are useful as surface treating agents.It is known that when trichlorosilane is contacted
with an olefinic nitrile, as exemplified by acrylonitrile, at
a sufficient temperature a mixture of α-cyanoalkylsilanes and
β-cyanoalkylsilanes is formed. In addition other reactions
such as the formation of both silicon and non-silicon-containing
complexes, homopolymerization of the starting 
nitrile and the disproportionation of the starting silane can
occur. The α-cyanoalkylsilanes are hydrolytically unstable.
Therefore, the β-cyanoalkylsilanes generally have more
commercial utility than the α-cyanoalkylsilanes and processes
for producing high yields of β-cyanoalkysilanes are
desirable.A number of catalysts have been reported in patents
as useful in the preparation of β-cyanoalkylsilanes. See,
for example, U.S. Patents 2,860,153, 2,906,764, 2,907,784,
2,971,970, 5,126,468 and 5,126,469. Useful catalysts are
also described in the article Rajkumar et al.,
Organometallics 8:549 (1989).Our earlier application, EP 0 525 997 A, describes
a process for the preparation of β-cyanoalkylsilanes
comprising contacting a silicon hydride with an
unsaturated olefinic nitrile in the presence of a
catalyst comprising a diamine and non-activated copper
or a copper compound.Journal of Organometallic Chemistry III
