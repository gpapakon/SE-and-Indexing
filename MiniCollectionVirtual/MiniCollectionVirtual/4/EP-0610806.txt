<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an absolute pressure sensor of the capacitive type, comprising a first element (2) in which a mobile electrode (4) is made, a second element (6) in which a fixed electrode (8) is made, which fixed electrode is located facing the said mobile electrode (4) and is insulated therefrom, a linkage frame (10) interposed within the first and second elements in order to define an enclosure (12) which is insulated from the external medium and in which a substantially zero pressure prevails, and a reference volume (14) connected with the said enclosure, the said sensor being characterised in that the first element (2) has the configuration of a membrane with substantially constant thickness and in that the said reference volume (14) is made at least partially in the second element (6).

Method of manufacturing of a plurality of
capacitive absolute pressure measuring sensors each

comprising a mobile electrode (4) and a fixed electrode
(8), comprising the following steps of:


supplying a first substrate (30) of a
semiconductor material,
supplying a second substrate (32) of a
semiconductor material,
forming a connecting insulating layer (34) on at
least one first face (36) of one (32) of said first and

second substrates,
structuring the connecting layer (34) to expose a
part of said first face to form at least one connecting

frame (10),
structuring the exposed part of said first face
(36) to define the fixed electrode (8) and a reference

volume (14),
assembling by soldering under vacuum said first
(30) and second (32) substrates using the connecting frame

(10) in such a way that a first face of said second
substrate is situated facing said first substrate and so

as to define a chamber (12), insulated from the external
environment, and inside which the pressure is substantially

zero, said chamber being in contact with said
reference volume (14), characterized in that it further

comprises the steps of :
thinning the other said substrate to produce a
membrane forming the mobile electrode (6),
structuring the other said substrate by
anisotropic etching to define the outline of said

membrane, and for each of the sensors,
forming an electrical contact (16a, 16b) for each
of the fixed electrode (8) and the mobile electrode (4),

and in that the connecting layer (34) comprises a lower
layer (38) of a first material which reacts essentially to 

a first etchant and an upper layer (40) of a second
material which reacts essentially to a second etchant.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the structuring step of said connecting layer (34)

consists of defining one part of the connecting layer
intended to serve as an etching mask for the structuring

step of the first face (36).
Method according to claim 2, characterized in
that said part of the connecting layer (34) forming the

etching mask substantially extends in the centre of said
connecting frame (10) and above the fixed electrode (8).
Method according to claim 3, characterized in
that the structuring step of the first face (36) comprises

the formation by etching of a groove (14) which extends
around the fixed electrode (8).
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the thinning step comprises a uniform etching of

the exposed surface of said first substrate to a specific
thickness.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the structuring step of the

second substrate (32) comprises a simultaneous separation
of the membranes (4) from one another.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that it also comprises, after the contact (16a, 16b)

formation step, a separation step of the individual
sensors by sawing of the second substrate (32).
