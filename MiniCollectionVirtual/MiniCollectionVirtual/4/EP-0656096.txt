<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to an ignition system for internal combustion engines with means for detecting misfirings. This ignition system makes it possible to detect the combustion voltage transformed on the primary side and to assess the spark duration and/or ignition combustion voltage through comparison with limit values for a proper ignition. The limit values for a proper ignition are derived from the measured values of a reference firing. The reference firing is the ignition triggered by the energy potential of the same ignition coil.

<CLAIMS>
Ignition system for internal combustion engines 
having at least one ignition coil (11) and one controllable 

switch (12) which is connected in series with the 
primary winding (10) and one sparking plug connected to 

the high-voltage-side end of the secondary winding and 
one tap (13), located between the primary winding and 

switch (12), for detecting the firing voltage transformed 
onto the primary side, and a downstream evaluation 

circuit (17, 18) for comparing the detected firing 
voltage with limit values for a correct combustion, 

characterized in that the ignition coil is a double spark 
coil and a sparking plug (ZK1, ZK2) is connected to each 

end of the secondary winding, and the limit values for a 
correct combustion are identified from the detected 

firing voltage of at least one preceding combustion 
cycle. 
Ignition system according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a prescribable number of past values is 

used for identifying the limit value. 
Ignition system according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the detected values of the firing 

voltage for ignition spark firing duration and/or ignition 
spark firing voltage may deviate from the limit 

values for a correct combustion by a specific value (T), 
without the ignition being evaluated as being faulty.
