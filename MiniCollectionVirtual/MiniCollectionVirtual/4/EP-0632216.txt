<ABSTRACT>
An automatic transmission (1) with five forward speeds comprises a 
main transmission unit (2) and an auxiliary transmission unit (5). 

The auxiliary transmission unit (5) comprises a first planetary gear 
(s3) and a second planetary gear (s4) which is located on the side 

of the rear casing. The ring gear (r3) of the first planetary gear 
(s3,25) is connected to the output element (23) of the main 

transmission unit (2), the carrier (cr3) is directly connected to the 
transmission output (1
2) and also to the sun gear (s3) via a 
multi-disc clutch (c3), which is located on the side of the rear 

casing. 
The hydraulic servo of the multidisc clutch (c3) is connected to an 
integral casing through a band brake (b4), arranged around the outer 

circumference of the servo. The ring gear (r4) of the second 
planetary gear (s4) is connected to the transmission output (12), the 

carrier (cr4) is connected to the integral casing through a 
multi-disc brake (b5), the sun gear (s4) is connected to the first 

sun gear (s3). The multi-disc brake (b5) and related hydraulic servo 
arranged on the rear casing side of the secondary planetary gear 

(s4). The rear casing forms part of the hydraulic servo for the 
multidisc brake. 
The auxiliary transmission unit (5) can be given a compact 
three-speed construction to establish five forward speeds while 

retaining a feasible mount on a vehicle, or it can be easily modified 
into a two-speed version by removing the second planetary gear (s4) 

and the brake (b5) for the 1st speed. This at a reasonable cost by 
making most of the component parts common.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic
transmission having a planetary gear especially suitable
if applied to an FF (i.e., Front-engine Front
drive type) automobile and, more particularly, to a
five-speed automatic transmission which is enabled to
construct a four-speed automatic transmission by a
slight change.In an automatic transmission, generally speaking,
an auxiliary transmission mechanism having one planetary
gear is added to a main transmission mechanism
having two planetary gears to establish four forward
speeds and one rear speed. The application of this
automatic transmission to the FF automobile is exemplified
by our U.S.P. No. 4,722,242 proposing a
four-speed automatic transmission, in which a first
shaft is arranged with a three-speed automatic transmission 
mechanism having a combination of two planetary
gears as the main transmission mechanism whereas a
second shaft is arranged with an under drive (UD)
mechanism having one planetary gear as the auxiliary
transmission mechanism.Incidentally, in recent years there has been a demand for an automatic transmission
having an increased number of forward
speeds, such as five, to improve
mileage and running performance. Therefore, we
have proposed an automatic transmission in which the
first shaft is arranged with a main transmission
mechanism having a combination of a single planetary
gear and a dual planetary gear whereas the second
shaft is arranged with a Simpson type auxiliary transmission
mechanism, as disclosed in U.S.P. No. 4,914,
978. Thus, the main transmission mechanism can
establish three or four forward speeds by a
slight change and, combined with a three-speed auxiliary
transmission mechanism, establish five or six
forward speeds in the entire automatic transmission
(as will be called the "multi-speed" automatic
transmission A).Generally the automatic transmission can be
classified into remarkably many kinds so as to correspond to
various kinds of vehicle and various needs. It 
would lead to a drastic increase in the production
cost to manufacture such various kinds of automatic
transmissions with correspondingly different parts and
on correspondingly different assembly lines. Hence,
it is an important target of the automatic transmission
to harmonize the various parts and the various assembly
lines. It is not exceptional to the
target to change the four-speed automatic transmission
into a five-speed one.In the aforementioned multi-speed automatic
transmission A, however, the auxiliary transmission
mechanism has its two
