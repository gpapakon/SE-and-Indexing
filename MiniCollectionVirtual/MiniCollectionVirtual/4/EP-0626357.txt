<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vitreous 
carbon-active carbon composite material, a process for producing 
said composite material, and a polarizable electrode 
using said composite material for use in electric double layer 
capacitor. Various proposals were made on the polarizable 
electrodes using active carbon or the like for use in electric 
double layer capacitor. That is, there were proposed, for 
example, a paste-like polarizable electrode obtained by mixing 
an active carbon powder with an electrolyte [Japanese Patent 
Application Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 102914/1989], a polarizable 
electrode obtained by activating an active carbon fiber 
[Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 19271 
6/1991], a polarizable electrode obtained by activating a 
carbon block [Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-Open) 
No. 1416291/1991], and a polarizable electrode obtained by 
treating an active carbon with a binder such as polyethylene, 
polypropylene or the like [Japanese Patent Application Kokai  
 
(Laid-Open) No. 22062/1992]. The polarizable electrodes using an active carbon or an active carbon fiber, however, 
have drawbacks of high internal resistance owing to the insufficient contact between 
active carbon particles, or of capacitance reduction owing to the detachment of powder or 
fiber. The polarizable electrode obtained by activating a carbon block is free from the drawbacks 
of high intemal resistance and powder detachment, but is unable to have a large 
electric capacitance per unit volume or unit weight because said activation is conducted only 
on the surface of carbon block and is not conducted in the interior. The polarizable electrode 
using a binder such as polyethylene, polypropylene or the like has a drawback of low adsorbability 
and accordingly low capability. From EP-A-0 036 601 a double layer capacitor using a foil derived from polyimids 
is known. The objects of the present invention are to provide a polarizable electrode which 
is free from the drawbacks of prior art, which has a low intemal resistance, which causes a 
low degree of powder detachment, which has large electric capacitance per unit weight and 
per unit volume, and which can be produced easily, quickly and inexpensively; and a vitreous 
carbon-active carbon composite material suitably used in production of said polarizable 
electrode. The present inventors made a study in order to achieve the above objects, based 
on the following idea. That is, since the vitreous carbon derived from a polycarbodiimide 
resin
