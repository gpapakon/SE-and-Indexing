<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vibration isolators and
in particular to such an isolator having fluid-filled
elastomeric isolation elements.Vibration isolators are well known and are commonly
used to mount engines to a frame. For example, in an
automobile, an elastomeric or other vibration isolator
mounts the engine to the frame to curtail the
transmission of vibrations from the engine to the frame.
Similarly, aircraft engines are mounted to the air frame
using vibration isolation mounts.It is desirable for vibration isolation mounts to
be strong and stiff when they are statically loaded so
as to support the weight of the engine or other element
they support and to counteract other static forces. As
an engine is accelerated, it will typically resonate at
a certain speed, which is known as the resonant
frequency. At the resonant frequency, the vibrations
generated by the engine are at their highest amplitude
and it is desirable to curtail their transmission to the
automotive, aircraft or other frame to which the engine
is mounted.It is a characteristic of elastomeric isolators
that they become stiffer when they are subjected to
higher frequency vibrations. Thus, at the resonant
frequency of an engine, an elastomeric isolator is
stiffer than when the engine is static, which is exactly
the opposite of the desired characteristic of the
isolator.Elasto-hydraulic isolators have also been developed
in which fluid filled elastomeric isolation elements are
employed in an effort to reduce the stiffness of the
vibration isolator at the resonant frequency of the 
engine. Typically, one or two elastomeric chambers are
provided and are filled with an incompressible fluid.
In the single chamber type, fluid is pumped by the
chamber as it is subjected to vibrations through an
inertia fluid track, which is usually in communication
with another variable volume chamber of a significantly
lower volume stiffness. In the two chamber type, the
fluid is pumped in an inertia fluid track which
communicates with both chambers and the chambers are
arranged so that as the volume of one increases, the
volume of the other diminishes, and vice versa. The
pumping of the fluid in the fluid track dissipates the
energy of the vibrations, and the fluid track can be
tuned, for example by varying its area and/or length, so
that the energy dissipation is maximized at the
vibration frequency sought to be isolated.The frequency at which the stiffness of the
vibration isolator is reduced is known as the notch
frequency, because on a plot of stiffness
