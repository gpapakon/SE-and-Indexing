heat consumers, comprising the following features: 


1.1 the multi-purpose storage is formed of a process water tank (1) and a buffer tank 
(2); 
1.2 the buffer tank (2) contains a heat exchanger (3) provided with forward and return 
flow connections (4,5) and includes an additional forward and return flow 

connection (6,7); 
1.3 the process water tank (1) provided with cold water supply and hot water discharge 
connections (8,9) is furnished with forward and return flow connections (10,11) for 

the heating fluid, 
 
characterized by the following combination: 


1.4 the return flow connection (7) of the buffer tank (2) is in communication with the 
heating fluid forward flow connection (10) of the process water tank (1); 
1.5 the forward flow connection (6) of the buffer tank (2) is in communication with the 
return flow connection (11) of the process water tank (1), and 
1.6 the process water tank (1) is arranged on the buffer tank (2) and the connecting 
points (S) between the connections (6,11;7,10) of the tanks (1,2) are detachably. 

designed. 
A storage according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the two tanks (1,2) are arranged within a common enclosure casing 

(12). 
A storage according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that the connecting points (S) are designed as T-pieces (T) capable of 

being coupled to the connection (6,7,10,11) externally of the enclosure casing (12).
