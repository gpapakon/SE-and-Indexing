 is H or alkyl; and R
<
2

-O-R
<
4
>
 wherein R
<

 and R
<

>
 are both straight or branched chain alkylene, and salts and esters thereof. These compounds are structurally similar to organophosphate pesticides, but may be conjugated to antigenic macromolecules. The invention therefore also provides immunoconjugates for use in preparing antibodies or fragments thereof which are capable of binding to ''parent'' organophosphate compounds and also the antibodies thus prepared. Such antibodies can be polyclonal or monoclonal with monoclonal antibodies being preferred. A method for detecting the presence of an organophosphate in a sample, and assay kits therefor are also provided, the method comprising the step of assaying the sample with an antibody or fragment thereof as provided by the invention. For such methods, the antibody can optionally be labelled or bound to a support or both. The methods of the invention are applicable to all classes of organophosphates.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMMUNO OGICAL DETECTION OF ORGANOPHOSPHATESTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to novel organophosphate compounds suitable for use as haptens, processes and novel intermediates for preparing the same, antibodies which are capable of binding to specific organophosphates, methods for preparing such antibodies, immunological assays employing such antibodies and assay kits including the antibodies.BACKGROUND ARTOrganophosphate pesticides are a large class of compounds commonly used as insecticides in the production of agricultural and horticultural produce. Legal maximum residue limits are stipulated by both national and international regulatory agencies for many of these compounds in most food crops and products. Increasingly, these levels are being monitored by the international and domestic agencies.Accordingly, there is a need for internationally acceptable, simple, rapid, reliable, portable, sensitive and cost-effective assay systems for determining the presence of these organophosphate compounds. Immunoassay- based tests fulfil all these requirements. Modern immunoassays are based on two important phenomena: (i) the extraordinary discriminatory power of antibodies; (ii) detection systems that allow the reaction of the antibody with its hapten to be quan itated at low concentrations of the reactants (antibody and hapten) . A plethora of labels has been applied as detecting agents in immunoassays such as enzymes, radioactive tracers, chemiluminescent and fluorescent labels, metal atom and sols, stable free radicals, latexes and bacteriophage.The use of enzymes, enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and solid phase technology has brought about widespread use of these techniques. An excellent review of enzyme immunoassay is provided by Tijssen P, "Practice and theory of enzyme immunoassays " in Laboratory techniques in biochemistry and molecular biology, Elsevier Amsterdam, New York, Oxford ISBN 0-7204-4200-1 (1990).Antibodies have proven useful reagents for the detection, quantitation and purification of large antigenic molecules and small biological and synthetic organic molecules. The former group can be injected into animals without further modification ,and providing a suitable immune response is evoked will result in antibodies that recognise the antigen. 

 Small molecules (MR < 1,000) are usually unable to invoke an immune response when injected into animals. These molecules therefore have to be conjugated to larger immunogenic molecules (carriers) . The small molecules then behave as an array of
