<ABSTRACT>
A pipe connecting structure is provided to mutually 
join tubes (1,2), and includes a pair of flanges (1a,2a) formed at end 

surfaces of a pair of pipes to be connected so as to be 
opposed to one another, a back-up ring (10) interposed between 

the pair of flanges, a projection of the back-up ring 
into which the pair of flanges are fitted, and a rubber 

packing (20) provided for an inner periphery of the back-up 
ring to be expanded and deformed in response to internal 

pressure of the tubes. In the pipe connecting structure, 
the pair of flanges are brought into pressure contact 

with the rubber packing and the pair of pipes are 
coaxially supported by clamping a housing by clamping 

measures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pipe connecting 
structure to mutually join pipes. There are known various methods of joining pipes 
mutually. For example, steel pipes are mutually 
connected by employing a screwed joint method, a flange 
joint method, a welded joint method, and so forth. In the screwed joint method, pipe ends of both of 
pipes to be connected are machined by a thread cutting 
device so as to form external threads, and seal material 
(a joint seal or the like) is applied to the external 
threads. Thereafter, the external threads are screwed 
into a coupling having internal threads, thereby mutually 
joining the pipes. The method is chiefly effective in 
mutually connecting steel pipes having small diameters. In the flange joint method, as in the case of the 
screwed joint method, the pipe ends of both the pipes to 
be connected are machined to form the external threads, 
and the external threads of the pipes are respectively 
screwed into flanges having an internal thread. Further, 
a packing is interposed between the flanges, and the 
flanges are mutually clamped by a bolt and a nut, thereby 
mutually joining the pipes. The method is chiefly 
effective in mutually connecting steel pipes having large 
diameters. In the welded joint method, edge preparation is 
applied by a beveling machine to the pipe ends of both  
 
the pipes to be connected, and brazing material is 
temporarily tacked into a V-shaped groove defined by the 
mutually butted pipe ends. Further, after centering, an 
electric welder is used to melt the brazing material so 
as to join the pipes forming the V-shaped groove. The 
method is chiefly effective in mutually connecting the 
steel pipes having the large diameters. A brazing joint method is also employed to mutually 
connect the steel pipes. In the brazing joint method, 
sealant (flux) is applied to the steel pipe and a steel 
joint, and a pipe end is inserted into the joint which is 
preheated by a heater such as torch lamp. After 
preheating, steel pipe brazing material is poured into a 
gap between the pipe and the joint, thereby joining the 
pipes. Alternatively, stainless pipes are mutually 
connected by employing a mechanical joint method, or the 
welded joint method. In the mechanical joint method, a 
diameter of a pipe end is extended or reduced by a 
dedicated jig, and a packing formed according to a shape 
of the pipe end is mounted to the extended or reduced 
pipe end, thereafter clamping by a threaded cap nut. The 
method is effective in mutually
