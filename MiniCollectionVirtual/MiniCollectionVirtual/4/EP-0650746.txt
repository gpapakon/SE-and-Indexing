<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a golf-like game, the playing surface of which consists of mutually independent individual playing fields (greens) and which can be set up on virtually any solid base (including roads, car parks etc.). The greens are characterised in that they consist of a sanded-in artificial lawn which, as a result of the dead weight of the sand, requires no further fastening to the ground, but can be made transportable again by sucking off the sand. By means of standardising the prefabricated playing fields and uniform rules derived from golf, even international tournaments are possible in this type of sport, which, with the designation "Putting Golf International", stands apart from conventional golf. Thanks to the absence of the drives of traditional golf, "Putting Golf International" offers a version of the game of golf which, although closely related to golf, is space-saving, weather-resistant, easy-care and can even be played indoors.
