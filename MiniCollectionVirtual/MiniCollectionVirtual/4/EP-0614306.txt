<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of image processing resources (214,216,218,200) including a finishing 
station (220) provides an image on a copy sheet during a given cyclical time period and a 

controller sequencer (212) electrically interconnected (215,217,219,221) to each of the 
resources directs the operation of the image processing resources, wherein the sequencer 

provides concurrent ready request signals to each of the resources including the finishing 
stations, each of the resources provide ready or not ready response signals to the sequencer, 

and dependent upon the ready or not ready signals of each of the resources the controller 
periodically skips cyclical time periods or pitches to allow the resources to synchronously reach a 

ready state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a controller, an image processing resource and a
method of operating an electronic image processing apparatus. More specifically, the
invention relates to distributed job scheduling, and, in particular, to job scheduling in an
electronic image processing apparatus with modular components such as distinct
finisher stations.In order to attach a piece of finishing equipment made for one print engine on
another print engine that operates at a different speed, the second print engine's
control software must be modified to allow for the finishing equipment's operation at
the new speed by adding skipped pitches. For instance, to add the Xerox 5090
machine finisher/binder to the Xerox 4090 machine print engine, a very extensive
change to the Xerox 4090 machine print engine control software would be required to
allow for interrupting the copy flow with skipped pitches (liming adjustments) for the
stitching or binding operations. This change would be required even though the exit
height and speed of the 4090 machine print engine is compatible with the 5090
machine finisher entrance height and speed.Also, in order to attach a finishing device to a copier/printer without modifying
the printer control software by adding the ability to skip pitches as needed, the only
option available is to add buffer trays in the finishing equipment. The buffer trays would
buffer the next set of copy sheets entering the finisher while the finishing operation is
continuing on the current set of copy sheets . This method adds cost, complexity, and
size unnecessarily to finishing equipment. The current method of scheduling copy
paper feeds is not very efficient for customers who may want to link or adapt finishing
modules to a variety of copiers/printers.EP 0 478 341 A2 describes an electronic printer having a controller and a
finisher connected. The printer utilizes software to calculate and predict the minimum
delay in successive jobs requiring finishing activities. Additional software innovations
allow job scheduling. The delays associated with the movement of various finishing
hardware components are calculated and analyzed by the job scheduler and system
controller. A. M. Lister, "Fundamentals of Operating Systems", the Macmillan Press Ltd.,
1979, pages 91 to 113 relates to operating systems and describes necessary and
sufficient conditions for deadlock in operating systems and methods for denying these
conditions. In order to deny the condition that processors hold the resources they
have already been

<CLAIMS>
A controller (7, 203, 205, 207, 209, 212) to be connected to a plurality of image
processing resources (6, 8, 107, 120, 204, 206, 208, 214, 216, 218, 220) of an

electronic image processing apparatus, the controller scheduling the timing of
operations to be executed based on a given repetitive time period, the controller

comprising:

means for generating and sending status ready requests for one of said operations
to a predetermined number of image processing resources;
means for receiving ready or not ready response signals from each of said
predetermined number of image processing resources;
means for deciding whether from each of said image processing resources a ready
response signal has been received;
means for executing said operation if from each of said image processing resources
a ready response signal has been received; and
means for skipping the current repetitive time period if from at least one of said
image processing resources a not ready response signal has been received.

be connected to a controller (7, 203, 205, 207, 209, 212) of an electronic image

processing apparatus, the image processing resource comprising: 

means for receiving status ready requests from the controller; and
means for generating and sending ready or not ready response signals to the
controller.
The image processing resource according to claim 2 wherein the image processing
resource is a finishing means.
The image processing resource according to claim 2 wherein the image processing
resource is a copy sheet source means.
The image processing resource according to claim 2 wherein the image processing
resource is a marking means.
The image processing resource according to claim 2 wherein the image processing
resource is a image input means.
An electronic image processing apparatus for providing an image on a copy sheet,
the apparatus comprising:


a controller (7, 203, 205, 207, 209, 212) according to claim 1; and

218, 220) according to one of claims 2 to 6.
A method of operating an electronic image processing apparatus having a plurality of
image processing resources (6, 8, 107, 120, 204, 206, 208. 214, 216, 218, 220) and

on a given repetitive time period for providing an image on a copy sheet, the method
comprising the steps of:


generating and sending (256) status ready requests for one of said operations from
