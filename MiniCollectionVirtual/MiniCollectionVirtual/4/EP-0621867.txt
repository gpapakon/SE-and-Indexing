<DESCRIPTION>
More particularly, it relates to new peptide compound
and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which have
pharmacological activities such as endotheline
antagonistic activity, to processes for its
preparation, to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the
same, and to a method of using the same therapeutically in
the treatment and the prevention of endothelin mediated
diseases such as hypertension.In the state of art several peptide compounds having
pharmaceutical activity are disclosed.In EP-A-0 333 174 a compound of the formula R1-A-D-Trp(R2)-Phe-
R3 is disclosed, which may be used as a medicament, especially
as a tachykinin antagonist and for the therapeutic treatment of
asthma. In the disclosed formula R1 is hydrogen or an amino
protective group, R2 is hydrogen, an amino protective group,
carbamoyl(lower)alkyl, carboxy(lower)alkyl or protected
carboxy(lower)alkyl, R3 is ar(lower)alkyl, a group of the
formula: -NR4R5, wherein R4 and R5 are each hydrogen, aryl or
lower alkyl which may have suitable substituent(s), or R4 and R5
are linked together to form benzene condensed lower alkylene,
or a group of the formula: -OR6, wherein R6 is hydrogen, aryl
or lower alkyl which may have suitable substituent(s), and A is
a single bond or one or two amino acid(s) residue, provided
that when A is one amino acid residue of -D-Trp-, then R4 is
not hydrogen.In EP-A-O 515 681 a peptide compound is disclosed which is a
tachykinin-antagonistic compound and has the following general
formula or its salt: R1-A1-D-Trp(R2)-A2-R3, wherein R1 represents 
hydrogen or an amino protective group, R2 represents an amino
protective group, R3 represents an aryl-lower alkoxy, N-(lower)
alkyl amino group, A1 represents a single bond or a single
amino acid residue, and A2 represents a single amino residue
other than Phe.European Patent Application EP-A-0 475 195 is a state of art
document according to Art. 54 (3) EPC for contracting states
AT, BE, CH/LI, DE, DK, DS, FR, BE, GR, IT, LU, NL, and SE. In
that patent application peptides having endothelin antagonist
activity are disclosed. The disclosed peptide compound has the
following general formula: R1-A-R2-CONR7-R3-CONR6-R4R5, in which R1
is hydrogen or acyl, R2 is lower alkyl, optionally substituted
ar(lower)alkyl, cyclo(lower)alkyl(lower)alkyl or optionally
substituted heterocyclic(lower)alkyl, R3 is optionally
substituted heterocyclic(lower)alkyl or optionally substituted
ar(lower)alkyl, R4 is hydrogen or optionally substituted lower
