<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides an improved system for monitoring and recording cell cultures. An improved lid (10) for the system includes pin sockets (28) interposed between traces (24) on a printed circuit board (22) and elongated, electrically conductive pins (38). A method for measuring a delay period for an alternating current voltage applied across a pair of pins (38) improves the stability of measurements made with the improved system. A method for applying a voltage across a pair of pins (38) which avoids exceeding a pre-established voltage avoids the possibility of damaging and/or destroying cells while monitoring their culture. Subtracting electrical conductivity measured for a reference well (16) that holds only cell growth media without cells from the electrical conductivity measured for other wells (16) during analysis of recorded data improves the presentation of test results obtained by monitoring and recording cell cultures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to systems for
monitoring the growth of cells while being cultured and, more
particularly, to such systems that employ an electrical current
for monitoring the culture.Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") patent application no.
PCT/US91/02320 filed 3 April 1991, published 17 October 1991,
and entitled "An Electronic Technique of Identifying an Effective
Drug for Treating a Cancer Patient" discloses a system for
monitoring and recording cell cultures. This PCT patent
application claims priority from a similarly titled United States
patent application no. 07/503,791 filed 3 April 1990, that
discloses a similar cell culture monitoring and recording system.The system disclosed in these patent applications monitors
and records cells being cultured in a conventional laboratory
tray. The tray has a plurality of separate wells with each well
being open at one end. This system includes a lid that is
disposed on top of the tray to cover the open ends of the tray's
wells. Secured to the top surface of the lid is a printed
circuit board that has a plurality of individual electrically
conductive traces formed on one surface. One end of each trace
is adapted to mate with and engage a printed circuit board
connector. Also secured to each trace is a non-reactive,
stainless steel pin that penetrates both the printed circuit
board and the lid. The placement of the traces on the printed
circuit board with respect to the lid arranges the pins in pairs
so that when the lid is placed on the tray each pair of pins is
inserted through the open end of and extends into a different
well in the tray.This system also includes a printed circuit board connector
that mates with the traces of the printed circuit board and
through which one pin of every pair is electrically connected 
to a common potential. An electronic data acquisition board is
electrically coupled to the printed circuit board connector.
The electronic data acquisition board includes a voltage source
for applying an electrical voltage across a pair of the pins.
A plurality of well switches, also included in the electronic
data acquisition board, selects one particular pair of the pins
to receive the voltage supplied by the voltage source. In
operation, the electronic data acquisition board preferably
applies an alternating current voltage of approximately 10
millivolts peak-to-peak across the pair of pins. This alternating
current voltage preferably has a frequency of approximately
400 Hz that is not harmonically related to 60 Hz.
