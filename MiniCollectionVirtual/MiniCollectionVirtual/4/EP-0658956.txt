<ABSTRACT>
A low connection force electrical connector 
system includes an elongated housing (1); a connection 

recess (2) extending in a longitudinal direction of said 
elongated housing and having a regulation face (8) and a 

guide face (7) in a plane parallel to a bottom face of said 
elongated housing; at least one upper and one lower channel 

(3, 4) formed on upper and lower inside walls of said 
connection recess, respectively; at least one upper and one 

lower contact element (10, 11) fitted in said upper and 
lower channel, respectively; and a circuit board (P) having 

an insertion slope (P1) at a lower front edge thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to low connection force electrical connectors
according to the preamble of independent claim 1.US-Patents 5,203,725 and 5,161,995 discloses low connection force electrical
connectors for the connection of a circuit board, whereby the circuit board is held
by upper and lower spring contact elements being a monolithic structure including
the upper and lower spring contact elements. U.S. Patent 5,161,995 discloses a low connection
force electrical connector such as shown in Fig. 3. A
circuit board P is inserted into a connection recess in a
oblique direction (L) and then turned counterclockwise (M)
to the horizontal position for lock while making a spring
contact with the contact elements 52.The contact elements 52 are fitted in channels 51A
and 51B formed in the housing 51. The contact elements 52
are made by stamping from sheet metal so as to have a rear
connection portion 52A and a semi-circular front contact
portion 52B with contact terminals 52B1 and 52B2 at opposite
ends. The lower contact terminal 52B1 is positioned more
forwardly than the upper contact terminal 52B2 by a
predetermined length.The upper and lower front ends 53 and 54 of the
connection recess is offset by the same length as the
predetermined length. A depression 55 with a shoulder 56
is formed on the bottom of the connection recess.When the circuit board P is inserted into the
connection recess in the oblique direction (L) with no or
light contact with the contact terminals 52B1 and 52B2, the
lower front edge of the circuit board P is received in the
depression 55 during the insertion and turning operation.Thus, with such a connector it is possible to
connect the circuit board to the connector with low
connection force while assuring satisfactory contact between
the circuit board and the contact elements.However, it is necessary to make a depression and
a shoulder for receiving and turning a circuit board. The depression makes it necessary to divide the metal mold into several pieces
and complicates the manufacture, resulting in the high manufacturing costs.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a low connection force
electrical connector which is free from the above problem.According to the invention said object is solved with the features of the
characterizing portion of independent claim 1. Prefered embodiments of the
invention are mentioned in the dependent subclaims and/or the following
description. In operation, a circuit board is inserted into the
connection recess in an oblique
