<ABSTRACT>
An integrated process is provided for the production of ditertiary butyl 
peroxide wherein isobutane oxidate containing tertiary butyl alcohol and tertiary 

butyl hydroperoxide is reacted in the presence of an aqueous acidic catalyst, the 
reaction mixture is separated into aqueous and organic phases, the aqueous catalyst 

is recovered from the aqueous phase and recycled, and the product peroxide is 
separated from tertiary butyl alcohol in the organic phase by water extraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides an integrated process
for the production of ditertiary butyl peroxide from
isobutane oxidate wherein the oxidate containing tertiary
butyl alcohol and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide is reacted in
the presence of a water soluble acid catalyst, the reaction
mixture is resolved into separate aqueous and organic
phases, tertiary butyl alcohol is recovered from the aqueous
phase and the water soluble catalyst is recycled, and the
organic phase is resolved in order to recover product
ditertiary butyl peroxide.The production of ditertiary butyl peroxide by reaction
of the tertiary butyl alcohol and tertiary butyl
hydroperoxide components of an isobutane reaction mixture is
known. See, for example, U.S. Patent 2,862,973.The recovery of ditertiary butyl peroxide from
admixtures containing tertiary butyl hydroperoxide and
tertiary butyl alcohol is likewise known. See, for example,
U.S. Patent 2,383,919. A later patent which seems to cover
much the same subject matter is U.S. Patent 4,900,850. Ditertiary butyl peroxide is an important chemical
having use for example as a catalyst in various organic
syntheses but having special utility as an additive to
diesel fuel formulations in order to improve the
characteristics thereof. Although methods have been
suggested for the production and recovery of ditertiary
butyl peroxide, as above indicated, there remains
considerable room for improvement in the efficiency and
economics of the technology for producing this product.According to the present invention, there is provided a process for the production of
ditertiary butyl peroxide which comprises:
forming ditertiary butyl peroxide by reacting isobutane oxidate containing tertiary butyl
hydroperoxide and tertiary butyl alcohol in the presence of a water soluble acid catalyst;
without the prior addition of water, separating the two-phase reaction product mixture into
an organic ditertiary butyl peroxide-containing phase and an aqueous phase containing
tertiary butyl alcohol and the said catalyst; distilling the aqueous phase to recover,
separately, (a) a tertiary butyl alcohol-containing stream, (b) a stream comprising water
formed in the reaction and introduced with the isobutane oxidate and (c) an aqueous
solution of said catalyst which is recycled as such to the peroxide reaction zone; water
extracting tertiary butyl alcohol from tertiary butyl peroxide in the said organic phase,
recovering tertiary butyl alcohol from the extraction water and recovering the tertiary
butyl peroxide product.In
