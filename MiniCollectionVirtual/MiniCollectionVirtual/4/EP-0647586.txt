<CLAIMS>
Device for driving a lifting apparatus, where in a drive 
train between the shaft of an asynchronous motor and the 

input drive shaft of the lifting apparatus, a gear unit 
and a slip clutch (3) are provided, 
characterized by the 
fact that
 the slip clutch (3) is set such that the torque 
produced by its static friction - slip torque - is greater 

than the starting torque of the asynchronous motor, but 
less than the torque occurring in the case of sudden 

loading of the gear unit output drive shaft (14) 
Device in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterized by the 
fact that
 the slip torque is lower than the maximum motor 
torque. 
Device in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by 
the fact that
 the slip clutch (3) is accommodated in a 
separate module which possesses standard connection 

dimensions. 
Device in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by 
the fact that
 the slip clutch (3) is installed in the 
gear unit. 
Device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 4, 

characterized by the fact that
 the slip clutch (3) 
possesses a wide range of adjustment. 
Device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 5, 

characterized by the fact that
 the gear unit takes the 
form of a planetary, helical or spur gear unit. 
Device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 6, 

characterized by the fact that
 onto the end face of the 
shaft accommodating the slip clutch (3) is screwed a 

hexagon nut (8) which, via a washer (7), a ball bearing  
 

(42) and a cup spring (6), exerts pressure on one of the 
clutch wheels (1) of the slip clutch (3). 
Device in accordance with Claim 4 in conjunction with one 
of Claims 5 to 7, 
characterized by the fact that
 the slip 
clutch (3) is fixed on a pinion shaft (12) of the gear 

unit and that a gear wheel (62) of the gear unit, on the 
one hand is retained between the friction linings (5) of 

the slip clutch and, on the other hand engages in the 
teeth of an adjacent shaft (11) of the gear unit. 
Device in accordance with Claim 8, 
characterized by the 
fact that
 the clutch wheels (1, 2) of the slip clutch (3) 
take the form of hollow shaft stubs (10, 20) on the sides 

facing one another, on which the gear wheel (62) is 
mounted by means of a journal bearing (4), and on the 

exterior adjacent thereto take the form of disks provided 
with friction linings (5), between which the gear wheel 

(62) is retained with its end faces (60).
