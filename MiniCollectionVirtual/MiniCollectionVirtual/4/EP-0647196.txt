<ABSTRACT>
This is a pallet as might as be used to support cargo during that cargo's transportation or storage. The pallet is constructed of paper. The pallet design involves a central platform or deck (100) constructed of a honeycomb filler bounded on the bottom surfaces by a corrugated sheet (106). The upper surface of the central platform (100) may be covered with a corrugated sheet or heavy paper stock (102). Additionally, the upper and/or lower sheets (102, 106) may be folded over the edges of the honeycomb core and fastened to the other side. Runners or legs (104) are included to support the central platform.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INTEGRATED TWO-WAY PAPER CARGO PALLETField of the InventionThis invention is a pallet as might be used to support cargo during that cargo's transportation or storage. The pallet is constructed of paper. The pallet design involves a central platform or deck constructed of a honeycomb filler bounded on the bottom surfaces by a corrugated sheet. The central platform may be made of a single piece of honeycomb filler or a number of pieces of honeycomb filler placed either adjacent each other to form a continuous block or spaced apart to form a block having open regions. The upper surface of the central platform may be covered with a corrugated sheet or heavy paper stock. Additionally, the upper and/or lower sheets may be folded over the edges of the honeycomb core and fastened to the other side. Runners or legs are included to support the central platform.Background of the Invention A pallet is a portable, horizontal, rigid, platform used as a base for assembling, storing, stacking, handling goods as a unit load. Conventional pallets are typically constructed of wood and are made by stapling or nailing a number of boards (known as "deckboards") at their ends to a number of continuous solid boards (known as "stringers") . The upper set and lower set (where used) of deckboards thereby form an open area defined by the thickness of the stringers. This opening is used to accommodate a fork lift or hand truck. In this way the pallet may be moved place to place by lifting the pallet and its load off the floor.SUBSTITUTESHEET 

 The vast majority of all pallets used in the U.S. are constructed of wood, but wood pallets have many disadvantages. Labor and material costs for wooden pallets have increased faster than inflation. Because of their expense, the pallets are often reused or returned to their place of origin. The cost of returning empty pallets to their owners is obviously high. Additionally, The average weight of a wooden pallet is about forty pounds. Since shipping costs are usually tied to the weight of the goods shipped, the cost of shipping is increased by the weight of the pallet. Indeed, pallets are sufficiently heavy that smaller warehouse workers are able manually to move the pallets only with some difficulty. Wooden pallets are often damaged during use and, because of the pallet cost, must be repaired if possible or disposed of. Depending upon the industry involved, pallets may be used between two and four times before they are disposed of. Disposal of any solid materials including broken pallets is

I CLAIM AS MY INVENTION:
1. A pallet comprising: a deck of a honeycomb core having an upper face, lower face, and edge; an upper facing sheet adherent to the upper face of the honeycomb core deck, multiple runner blocks separated from each other and adhesively mounted to the lower face of the honeycomb core deck and covering at least a portion of the lower face, a lower facing sheet comprising a corrugated sheet having flutes therein and adherent respectively to the multiple runner blocks and the lower face of the honeycomb core deck.
2. The pallet of claim 1 where the composition of one or more of the honeycomb core, upper and lower facing sheets, upper and lower corrugates, and upper and lower sheets is selected from paper, MYLAR, polyethylene, polypropylene (clear or fibrous paper product).
3. The pallet of claim 2 where the composition of one or more of the honeycomb core, upper and lower facing sheets, upper and lower corrugates, and upper and lower sheets is selected from paper.
4. The pallet of claim 1 in which the upper facing sheet is paper.
5. The pallet of claim 1 in which the upper facing sheet is corrugate having flutes therein.
6. The pallet of claim 5 in which the flutes in the upper facing are not parallel to the flutes in the lower facing sheet.
7. The pallet of claim 1 in which at least one of the upper facing sheet and lower facing sheet are folded over and adherent to the edge of

the honeycomb core and to the other facing sheet.
8. The pallet of claim 1 where a substantial portion of cells within the honeycomb core are sealed.
9. The pallet of claim 1 where additional corrugate sheets are adherent to the upper face of the honeycomb core deck.
10. The pallet of claim 1 comprising two or more runners.
1 1 . The pallet of claim 10 where the runners comprise a honeycomb runner core.
12. The pallet of claim 8 where the runners comprise a laminate corrugate core.
13. The pallet of claim 1 where further including block support sheet glued to the bottom of the runnerblocks.
14. The pallet of claim 13 where the block support sheet has holes positioned between the runnerblocks.
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


15. A paper pallet comprising: a deck of an expanded paper honeycomb core having an upper face, lower face, and edge; an upper facing sheet of paper sheet adherent to the upper face of the honeycomb core; multiple honeycomb runner blocks separated from each other and adhesively mounted to the lower face of the honeycomb core deck and covering at least a portion of the lower face, a lower facing sheet comprising a corrugated sheet having flutes therein and adherent respectively to the multiple runner blocks and the lower face of the honeycomb core deck.
16. The pallet of claim 15 where a substantial portion of cells within the honeycomb core are sealed.
17. The pallet of claim 15 comprising two or more runners adhesively attached to the lower face of the deck.
18. The pallet of claim 17 in which the runners are adhesively attached to the deck through glue sheets.
19. The pallet of claim 15 where further including block support sheet glued to the bottom of the runnerblocks.
20. The pallet of claim 19 where the block support sheet has holes positioned between the runnerblocks.
