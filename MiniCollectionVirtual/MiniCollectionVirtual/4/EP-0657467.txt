<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel antitumor 
antibiotics, process for their fermentative 
production, and the producing microorganism per se. U.S. Patent 4,360,458 issued to Koshiyama et al 
on November 23, 1982 discloses an antitumor complex 
disignated BBM-928 (now called luzopeptin) produced by 
Actinomadura luzonensis ATCC 31491. US Patent 
4,451,456 issued to Koshiyama et al on May 29, 1984 
and UK Published Application No. 2,134,119, published 
August 4, 1984 disclose the structures of antibiotics 
BBM-928A, B, C, D and E2 as follows: 
Component R₁ R₂ Aacetoxyacetoxy Bacetoxyhydroxy Chydroxyhydroxy Dacetoxypropionyloxy E2hydrogenhydrogen US Patent 4,582,639 issued to Matson et al on 
April 15, 1986 discloses the antibiotic sandramycin 
produced by Nocardioides sp. strain C49,009, and 
having the structural formula 
Microbially derived quinoxaline antibiotics may 
be exemplified by echinomycin whose structure is 
reported in Dell et al, "Structure Revision of the 
Antibiotic Echinomycin," Journal of the American 
Chemical Society, 1975, 97:2497-2502 as the following: 
Compounds of the present invention are 
distinguished over the afore-mentioned depsipeptide 
antibiotics by the presence of a quinoxaline nucleus 
and a tetrahydropyridazine moiety. The present invention provides novel antitumor 
antibiotics of the formula (I) 
wherein R₁ is 2-methylpropanoyl, and R₂ is 2-methylpropanoyl, 
propanoyl or acetyl; or R₁ is 3-methylbutanoyl, 
and R₂ is 2-methylpropanoyl or 3-methylbutanoyl; 
or R₁ is propanoyl, and R₂ is acetyl or 
propanoyl. Another aspect of the invention provides a 
pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound 
of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable 
carrier. Another aspect of the present invention provides 
a process for the preparation of the antibiotics of 
formula (I) which comprises cultivating Micromonospora 
strain C39500, or an antibiotic producing mutant 
thereof, in an aqueous nutrient medium containing 
assimilable sources of carbon and nitrogen under  
 
submerged aerobic conditions, and isolating said 
antibiotics. Yet another aspect of the present invention 
provides a method for inhibiting a tumor sensitive to 
a compound of formula (I) in a mammalian host which 
comprises administering to said host an antitumor 
effective amount of a compound of formula (I). Another aspect of the present invention provides 
a biologically pure culture of Micromonospora strain 
C39500 ATCC 55011. The antibiotics of the present invention are 
components of an active
