which is adhered onto a light transmitting member for 

transmitting a light beam. A plurality of electrode pads 
are formed, corresponding to the leads, on a photoelectric

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photoelectric
converting apparatus for use in a camera
or the like that employs a photoelectric converting device
such as a CCD and a fabrication method thereof.Cameras having a CCD have been widely used in various
fields from home use to industrial use. Small medical
cameras have been used for endoscopes. At present time,
the minimum diameter of these cameras is 8 mm. However,
since small diameters of cameras are being strongly desired
to improve the characteristics of the endoscopes and
marketability thereof, these very small cameras are being
intensively studied and developed. The central portions of
such cameras are CCDs. The packaging techniques for the
CCDs are the most important development theme. As the CCD
packages for conventional cameras, ceramic packages have 
been widely used from viewpoints of mass production and low
cost. However, since the sizes of the ceramic packages are
limited with the ceramic packages, alternate mounting
techniques are being developed by many manufacturers.Next, a related art reference of a conventional
mounting method that is practically used will be described.Fig. 23 shows an example of COG (Chip On Glass)
method. In this method, an optical glass 1 is prepared (at
step a). A thick gold film wiring layer 4 is formed at a
plane portion 2 and an edge portion 3 of the optical glass
(at step b). A low melting point metal paste is printed at
a connecting portion for the CCD. An example of the metal
paste is an alloy of indium and lead. The metal paste is
heated and melted so as to form bumps 5 (at step c). A CCD
6 is prepared (at step d). Metal ball bumps 7 are formed
on the CCD 6 according to wire bonding method (at step e).
The metal bumps 5 on the optical glass 1 and the metal ball
bumps 7 on the CCD 6 are heat pressed at a heat resisting
temperature of the CCD or less (namely, 150°C or less) so
as to connect the metal bumps 5 and the corresponding gold
ball bumps 7 (at step f). In addition, to improve the
mechanical strength of the connected portion, the space
between the bump connected portions and the CCD pixels is
filled and sealed with a resin 8 (at step g). Thereafter,
an outer connecting electrode 9 disposed at an edge of the
optical glass 1 is connected to a flexible substrate 10 (at
step h). At this point, with an adhesive sheet or the like 
having for example anisotropy characteristics, the outer
connecting electrode 9 and the flexible substrate 10 are
heat pressed. As an advantage of the COG method, the
alignment accuracy
