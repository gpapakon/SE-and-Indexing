connection control equipment connected to the subscriber 
line of a particular ISDN local switch manages mobile subscriber 

data register equipment. Connection of a call 
which originates from or terminates at a mobile station, 

registration of the location of the mobile station, and 
channel switching process during service are performed by 

way of the mobile subscriber connection control equipment

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mobile communication
system, and more particularly to a digital mobile
communication system which makes use of an ISDN switched
network.Conventionally, a mobile communication system is
constructed with a switch for exclusive use for mobile
subscribers. For instance, in order to perform a
connection process of a call which is originated or
terminated between a mobile subscriber which uses a mobile
station and another subscriber of a fixed network, a
switch for exclusive use (visitor mobile telephone switch)
is first provided for each of the base stations located in
a prescribed area, and these switches are connected to the
fixed network (routing switched network) by way of gateway
mobile telephone switches (Document 1 and Document 2).Document 1: Kota Kinoshita, "Technique Supporting
Digital Mobile Telephones - System Network Implementation
Technique," Journal of the Electronic Information Communication
Society of Japan, Vol. 73, No. 8, pp. 812-818, 
1990.Document 2: Minoru Tanaka, "Mobile Radiocommunication
System," Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 151136/83.Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing an example of a
conventional mobile telephone system disclosed in Document
1. Referring to Fig. 6, mobile station 11 has radio
transmission and reception functions. Base stations 12a
and 12b are connected to visitor mobile telephone switch
13 and perform radio communication with mobile station 11,
and further perform call connection with visitor mobile
telephone switch 13. Visitor mobile telephone switch 13
has visitor control and connection functions for mobile
station 11. Gateway mobile telephone switch 14 has a
routing function between visitor mobile telephone switch
13 and public telephone switched network 15 including
local switch 16 to which fixed subscriber 17 is connected.
Home memory station 18 is connected to visitor mobile
telephone switch 13 and gateway mobile telephone switch
14, and registers the specific numbers of mobile stations
and location registration information.The system of Document 2 is proposed to allow a
subscriber to perform communication by way of a same
terminal between different mobile radiocommunication
systems such as a mobile telephone system, a portable
telephone system and a cordless telephone system. Claim 1
recites a mobile telephone radio base station and a 
portable telephone radio base station connected to a wire
communication switched network. According to an embodiment,
however, base stations of the mobile telephone
system and the portable telephone
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mobile communication system which is constructed in an ISDN
switched network (6), comprising:


mobile subscriber data register equipment (5) for registering information
regarding mobile subscribers (1) including subscriber numbers (N(1)) of the

mobile subscribers (1), subscriber data of the mobile subscribers, identification
numbers (PN(1)) of mobile stations (1), and location information of the mobile

stations;
base stations (2a, 2b) connected to subscriber lines of ISDN local
switches (3a) through ISDN subscriber interfaces, and performing radio link

control of said mobile stations (1) to connect calls which are originated from or
terminated at the mobile stations (1) to said ISDN switched network (6) by way

of the subscriber lines; and
mobile subscriber connection control equipment (4) connected to a
subscriber line of an ISDN local switch (3b) through subscriber interface, and to

said mobile subscriber data register equipment (5),

   
characterized in that

   said mobile communication system is adapted to first route calls which
are originated from or terminated at the mobile stations (1) to said mobile

subscriber connection control equipment (4) over said subscriber line of said
ISDN local switch (2a), and said mobile subscriber connection control

equipment (4) is adapted to thereafter complete the calls by re-originating said
calls terminated at the mobile subscriber connection control equipment (4) over

said ISDN switched network (6) through said ISDN local switch (3b) and
designating a called subscriber as the terminating address, and

   when one of the mobile stations (1) during service transmits a channel
switching request signal to one of the base stations (2a) which is in control

designating an adjacent base station (2b) to which said one of the mobile
stations (1) desires to be connected, said one of the base stations (2a) which is

in control is adapted to originate a call to said mobile subscriber connection
control equipment (4) to report the channel switching request along with the 

identification number (PN(1)) of said one of the mobile stations (1) and said
channel switching request signal as additional information; said mobile

subscriber connection control equipment (4) is adapted to originate a call to
said adjacent base station (2b) to report information regarding the channel

switching request and to instruct said adjacent base station (2b) to secure a
radio channel for switching; said adjacent base station (2b) is adapted to store

the identification number (PN(1)) of said one of the mobile stations (1) and to
report a securing condition of a radio channel for switching to said mobile

subscriber connection control equipment (4) using an alerting signal; said
mobile subscr
iber connection control equipment (4) is adapted to instruct, when
it confirms that the radio channel for switching has been prepared, channel

switching to said one of the base stations (2a) which is in control using an
alerting signal adding the information of the radio channel for switching; said

one of the base stations (2a) which is in control is adapted to instruct said
