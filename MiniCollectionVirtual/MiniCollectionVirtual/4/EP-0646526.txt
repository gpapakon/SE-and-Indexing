<ABSTRACT>
Side folding guides 1 approach side flaps A2 to hit 
a hitting part 1a against closed side faces B2, B2 of a 

wrapped body of a content B, thereby pressing a body 
wrapping part A7 near the base end of side flaps A2 

facing the closed side faces B2, B2 against the closed 
side faces B2, B2; and subsequently the middle part of 

the side folding guides 1 make a quarter turn while 
tracing a corner B3 continued to the closed sides B2, 

B2, and therefore the base end of the side flaps A2 are 
folded along the corners B3 while being pulled toward 

the forward end thereof, and, at the same time, are 
pressed by folding parts 1c against the open sides B1, 

B1 through the entire length from the base end to 
forward end of the side flaps A2 .

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wrapping machine with a flap folding device for folding the
protruding ends of a wrapping sheet of kraft or the like paper, after it has been wrapped around
an approximately rectangular item referred to herein as the "content" which may be for example a
stack of paper, a number of books, belt-like cloth or textile folded longitudinally in a zig-zag
form, or a stack of boxes.The flap folding device has a pair of side-folding guides which are arranged on the same planes as
the open sides of the content and can move into contact with, and away from, the side flaps of the
protruding ends of the wrapping sheet. As the side-folding guides contact the side flaps, the side
flaps are folded inward along the open side of the content, and subsequently, remaining lower and
upper flaps at each protruding end are folded in order along the open side of the content.One known form of flap folding device of this type, is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-open
No. Hei 332004. In this known device, projections are provided in the vicinity of the upper
and lower ends of each side flap by forming each side-folding guide so that it is a little smaller in a
vertical size than that of the content. These side-folding guides are caused to approach both side
flaps, until the upper and lower projections hit against the upper and lower ends of each side flap.Furthermore, as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. Hei 2-23305, each side-folding
guide is composed of a pair of upper and lower plates, which are horizontally rotatable
such that a clearance between the upper and lower plates can be adjusted in accordance with a
change in the vertical size of the content. These side-folding guides rotate, substantially
simultaneously, until they hit against the upper and lower ends of both side flaps. Thereafter, the side-folding guides are horizontally moved along the open side of the content,
pushing the upper and lower ends of both side flaps as in a straight state from the base end to the
forward end, while folding each side flap at the base end at a right angle until the whole of the
side flap is flat against the open side. At the same time, the lower flap and the upper flap are
folded at both side ends, at 45 degrees, to produce a horizontal folding line, to be protruded out
horizontally.Furthermore, as disclosed in for example Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 3-14685, with the
content placed on a wrapping sheet which has been fed onto an elevator, a switch is manually
operated

said open side (B1) of said content (B) and thereafter a lower flap (A3) and an upper flap (A4) in
order, at the remaining overhang ends along said open side (B1) of said content (B), said flap

folding device being characterised by an elevating means (2) for time shifting the contact-rotation
between said pair of side folding guides (1) and both of said side flaps (A2), and elevating either

one of said content (B) and said side folding guides (1), an input means (9) for variably
inputting the width (W) of each open side (B1) of said content (B), the length (L)

intersecting said width, the height of the content, and the length (SL) and width
