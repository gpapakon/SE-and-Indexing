<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for measuring component 
concentrations which enables accurate measurement of 

concentrations of component within an object in a non-destructive, 
non-invasive, and bloodless procedure. The 

apparatus comprises a light irradiator 1 for projecting 
pulse laser of different wavelengths toward an object 12 by 

means of a variable wavelength laser generating unit 11, a 

photodetector 2 for performing a time resolved measurement 
of the quantity of transmitted light from the object which 

is subject to changes with lapse of time after the 
generation of the pulse laser, and an arithmetic unit 3 for 

calculating concentrations of components in the object 12 
and outputting the calculation result such that the 

relationship between time lapse and measured quantity of 
light is converted into a relationship between an optical 

path length representing the distance of light travel 
within the object 12 and a change in the measured quantity 

of light relative to a change in unit concentration so that 
the optical path length and the quantity of light which is 

measured when the change in the quantity of light is at a 
peak are stored in memory for each wavelength, the quantity 

of light being used as a basis for the calculation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and
method for measuring concentrations of components which are
suitable for use in carrying out non-destructive
measurements and/or non-invasive, bloodless measurements.Conventionally, in the fields of biology and
medicine, a near infrared CT (computed tomography) has been
known which enables a non-invasive, bloodless examination
of an object. This technique utilizes the so-called time
of flight method for near infrared rays in scattering
optical system. For example, in the case of the near
infrared CT, a pulse laser is irradiated toward the object
from one side thereof for time-resolved measurement of
quantity of light passing through the object which change
with lapse of time, data for the changing quantity of light
being disregarded except the data for the quantity of light
which has passed through the object for an initial very
short time period. An image of the interior of the object
is formed on the basis of the data for the quantity of
light obtained during the initial short time. In other 
words, the light which has reached the photoreceptor in the
initial short time are considered as having passed through
the interior of the object along the shortest possible
optical path and only data for that quantity of light is
used to obtain a clear and sharp image.In the conventional near infrared CT, only an
initial portion of the transmitted light varying with time
lapse is utilized to obtain information on the interior of
the object. For the purpose of measuring a concentration
of a component in the object, however, it is not
necessarily suitable to adopt the same concept as that of
the near infrared CT.The time-of-flight method is also diclosed in US-A-5 119 815 and in B.C.Wilson: "Time-Dependent Optical Spectroscopy and Imaging for Biomedical Applications" in Proc. of IEEE, vol.80, no.6, 1992.In order to accurately determine a concentration
of a component, it is necessary to increase the measurement
accuracy of a measuring system, and for this purpose it is
necessary to enhance the S/N ratio of the measuring system.The present invention is directed to meeting the
foregoing needs, and accordingly it is an object of the
invention to provide an apparatus and method for measuring
concentrations of components which enables accurate
measurement of component concentrations within an object in
a non-destructive, non-invasive, and bloodless procedure.In order to accomplish the above object, 
according to a first aspect of the invention, there is
provided an

pulse light of different wavelengths toward an object (12), a
photodetector (2) for performing a time resolved measurement of

the quantity of light with respect to at least one of
reflected light and transmitted light from the object (12) which quantity

is subject to changes with lapse of time after the
generation of the pulse light, and an arithmetic unit (3) for

calculating a component concentration in the object (12) and
outputting the calculation result in the following manner: based on the conversion of the

light into a relationship between an optical

path length representing the distance of light travel
within the object (12) and sensitivity S defined as a change dJ in the measure quantity of

light relative to a change dC in unit concentration
