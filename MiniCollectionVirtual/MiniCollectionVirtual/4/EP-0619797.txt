<ABSTRACT>
An aerosol valve having a valve ferrule, a valve stem (12) and at least one valve seal (16), in which the valve seal is impregnated with a physiologically acceptable surfactant. The valves of the invention exhibit improved force-to-fire and improved return force compared to valves containing untreated valve seals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aerosol valves and to 
valve seals for use therein. The invention also 
relates to a method of providing sustained lubrication 
to aerosol valves, particularly valves used for 
dispensing medicament to the respiratory system of a 
patient. The use of aerosol devices to administer drugs or 
other therapeutically active compounds by inhalation 
therapy is common. Aerosol dispensing containers are 
charged with a self propelling liquid composition 
containing the medicament dissolved or dispersed 
therein and provided with an aerosol valve capable of 
discharging metered amounts of the composition. Such 
aerosol dispensing containers may be incorporated into 
a device including a breath actuated mechanism to 
synchronize dispensing of the medicament with 
inspiration by the patient. An example of such a 
device is the AUTOHALER™ brand aerosol inhalation 
device (3M) disclosed, for example, in European Patent 
No. 147028. Lubrication is an important factor in aerosol 
valves for use in inhalers. Lack of lubrication within 
a valve can cause sticking and high friction between 
the valve seals and the valve stem. This requires high 
firing forces in order to actuate the valve which can 
cause difficulty for the patient to coordinate valve 
actuation and inhalation simultaneously. Lack of 
lubrication within an aerosol valve may also result in 
slow return or non-return of the valve stem after 
actuation. Breath actuated devices require a smoothly 
functioning valve in order to ensure the proper 
function of the device. The term "valve seal" used herein is used 
generically to refer to any of the seals employed 
within an aerosol valve and includes, but is not  
 
limited to, the diaphragm, tank seal and sealing member 
(parts 16, 34, and 52 of the valve shown in the 
accompanying drawing). In commercial production, valve seals used in aerosol valves for inhalers 
are generally subjected to a prolonged wash in a 
solvent, e.g., an aerosol propellent, such as 
Propellent 11 under reflux, in order to extract process 
oils and other additives which are present in the 
elastomer mix from which the valve rubbers are made. 
The purpose of the extraction process is to remove any 
components from the valve seals which might be leached 
out by contact with the aerosol formulation in the 
container to which the valve is applied. The presence 
of such extracts in the aerosol formulation may produce 
an unacceptable taste, may cause instability of the 
aerosol formulation or in an extreme case

characterised in that the surfactant is oleic acid or 

lecithin. 
A device (10) comprising an aerosol container (30) 
containing a self propelling aerosol formulation 

comprising aerosol propellent having dissolved or 
dispersed therein a medicament characterised in that the 

container is equipped with an aerosol valve as claimed in 
any preceding Claim. 
A device (10) as claimed in Claim 6 characterised in 
that the aerosol formulation contains less than an 

effective lubricating amount for an aerosol valve of a 
surfactant. 
A device as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7 
characterised in that the aerosol formulation comprises 

less than 0.1% by weight of surfactant. 
A device as claimed in any one of Claims 6 to 8 
characterised in that the aerosol formulation is free of 

surfactant.  
 
A device as claimed in any one of Claims 6 to 9 
characterised in that the surfactant impregnating the 

valve seal is substantially insoluble in the aerosol 
propellent. 
A device as claimed in any one of Claims 6 to 10 
characterised in that the propellent is selected from 

Propellent 11, Propellent 12, Propellent 114, Propellent 
134a, Propellent 227, and mixtures thereof. 
A method for imparting lubricating properties to a 
valve seal for an aerosol valve or to the rubber material 

from which the valve seal will be formed which comprises 
contacting the valve seal or rubber material with a 

solution of a physiologically acceptable surfactant 
characterised in that said contact is for a sufficient 

period for the surfactant to impregnate the valve seal or 
rubber. 
A method as claimed in Claim 12 characterised in 
that the solution is of a surfactant dissolved in 

Propellent 11. 
A method as claimed in Claim 12 or Claim 13 
characterised in that the surfactant is a C₁₀-C₂₂ fatty
