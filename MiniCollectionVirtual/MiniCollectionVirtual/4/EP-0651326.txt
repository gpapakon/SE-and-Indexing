<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to architecture for a 
knowledge machine and more specifically to a knowledge 
machine method and apparatus. Unlike data processing of 
conventional computer systems and unlike call processing 
switching systems, the present invention knowledge machine 
method and apparatus is a significant improvement over 
modern electronic switching systems and includes 
modifications to the communication, switching and 
administrative modules as well as the addition of one or 
more knowledge modules. In conventional processing of data, the central 
processing unit plays the dominant role in executing the 
binary instructions in a pre-defined programmed sequence. 
Data availability and access is made feasible by the 
linking and loading functions. The processes involved in 
installing executable binary codes into the computer in 
usable form, are compiling, assembling and linking as well 
as the actual loading of the program and of the data into 
the core storage area of the computer. One process 
generally (and conveniently) forgotten by the computer 
scientists is the higher level language programming of a 
problem that is to be solved. Assuming no errors in these 
processes, the machine sequentially executes these 
instructions and brings the program to a normal 
termination and provides the user with the results that 
were being sought by the user without attention to the 
language of the program(s) in and loaded into the 
computer. In telecommunication networks with electronic 
switching, the switching system or systems plays the  
 
dominant role in executing the various steps that are 
necessary for call processing. The sequence of the steps 
necessary for the completion of call processing is much 
more varied than the sequence of instructions for data 
processing. The switching systems may be distributed and 
the cooperative role of the various switching systems may 
become essential. This aspect is not unlike the 
controlled distribution of the processing in 
multiprocessor/multicomputer systems. Fortunately, with 
the evolution of the common channel interoffice signalling 
system and the standardization of its protocol, 
distributed call processing is not a problem in most 
modern communication networks. It is interesting to note 
that the level of programming in the switching systems is 
at higher level than the programming level of the third 
generation programming languages. This jump leaves the 
programmers of the switching systems with the more mundane 
functions of
