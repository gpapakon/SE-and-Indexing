<ABSTRACT>
The instant invention provides the porcine vasoactive 
intestinal peptide (pVIP) receptor protein. The invention also 

provides DNA compounds encoding the pVIP receptor, recombinant 
DNA cloning and expression vectors comprising said DNA sequence, 

and recombinant host cells comprising said vectors. The 
invention also provides methods of using the pVIP receptor in 

assay systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
Peptide hormones act as messengers on target 
tissues stimulating the target organ to respond to a 
physiological conditions sensed, directly or indirectly, 
from the brain. A variety of diseases are known to result 
from abnormalities in the quantity, stability, or activity 
of indigenously produced peptide hormones. Some types of 
these diseases are amenable to treatment by hormone 
supplementation. Peptide hormones, classically isolated 
from natural sources, are currently produced using 
recombinant DNA technology making such hormones 
commercially available for the treatment of a variety of 
diseases. The mechanism of action of peptide hormones and 
their corresponding therapeutic potential cannot be 
divorced from the complex cascade which mediates their 
action. Maintenance of the balance between synthesis and 
catabolism, activation and repression or energy usage and 
storage allow the organism to adapt to environmental stress 
but return to a basal state once the stimulus is removed. 
The instant invention provides a protein, the porcine 
vasoactive intestinal peptide (pVIP) receptor whose  
 
activity is intimately tied to vasodilative effects in 
lung, gastrointestinal tract and possibly some other 
tissues. A number of G-protein coupled receptors have 
been cloned, for example, the receptors for mouse 
gonadotropin release hormone (Tsutsumi, etal., 1991, 
Molecular Endocrinology 6:1163-1169), adenylate cyclase 
activating polypeptide (Arimura, A., 1992, TEM 3:288-294, 
lutropin-choriogonadotropin (McFarland, etal., 1989, 
Science 245: 494-499), thyrotropin releasing hormone (Zhao, 
etal., 1992, Endocrinology 130:3529-3536), human and rat 
dopamine (Zhou, etal., 1990, Nature 347:76-80), glucagon-like 
peptide 1 (Thorens 1992, PNAS 89:8641-8645), 
calcitonin (Lin, etal., 1991, Science 254:1022-1024) 
parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related peptide 
(Abou-Samra, etal., 1992, PNAS 89:2732-2736), endothelin 1 
(Lin, etal., 1991 PNAS 88:3185-3189), secretin (Ishihara, 
etal., 1991, EMBO J. 10:1635-1641), and rat vasoactive 
intestinal peptide (Ishihara etal., 1992, Neuron 8:811-819). This invention establishes the precise identity 
of the porcine pVIP receptor . The present invention also 
provides methods to purify the pVIP receptor and DNA 
sequences encoding same, and to produce useful quantities 
of each using recombinant DNA techniques. This and other 
objects of the instant invention will be apparent from the 
specification as a whole. The instant invention provides:
