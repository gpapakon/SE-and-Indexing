<ABSTRACT>
Tuning device of a tunable optical filter (1) usable particularly in reception in an optical transmission system, and intended to eject part of an optical noise, consisting particularly of the noise created by an optical receiving preamplifier (2), being superimposed on a useful optical signal, the device including means (4) for controlling a movement, along the axis of the wavelengths, of the characteristic of the said optical filter, and means, called tuning detection means, making it possible to detect the instant when the said movement command can be stopped, and themselves including an optical power detector (6) receiving a signal originating from the said optical filtre, and means (5) for detecting any modulation of a signal coming from the said optical power detector, the said movement command being able to be stopped when the said means for detecting any modulation detect modulation of the said signal originating from the said optical power detector.

Tunable optical filter tuning device (1) suitable for use in the receive part of an
optical transmission system and adapted to reject some optical noise

superimposed on a wanted optical signal, said device including means (4) for
commanding displacement of the characteristic of sai
d optical filter along the
wavelength axis and tuning detector means adapted to detect the time at which

said displacement can be stopped, characterized in that said tuning detector
means include an optical power detector (6-3') receiving a signal from said

optical filter and means (5-5') for detecting any modulation of a signal from said
optical power detector, said displacement being stopped when said detector

means detect modulation of said signal from said optical power detector.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, said optical noise comprising
noise created by a receive optical preamplifier (2), said modulation detector

means (5) include:

measuring means (7) for measuring a magnitude characteristic of the
amplitude of said signal from said optical power detector other than its mean

value, said measuring means having a bandwidth excluding the null frequency
and including some or all of the frequencies forming the spectrum of the signal

conveying information to be transmitted by the system,
means (9) for comparing the result supplied by said measuring means to a
predetermined threshold so that, according to whether the signal received by said

optical power detector is entirely constituted of said optical noise or not, the result
supplied by said measuring means is differently situated relative to said threshold.
Device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that it further comprises
tuning maintaining means including control loop means (10, 11, 12) including

means for producing a correction signal (3) applied to said filter and further
comprising:


means for continuing to command displacement of the characteristic of said
optical filter after said modulation detector means have detected modulation of

said signal from said optical power detector,
means (14) for comparing said correction signal with a threshold, and
means for stopping said displacement according to the situation of said
correction signal relative to said threshold.
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that said displacement is effected by
applying a ramp control signal (C1) to said filter and in that said means for 

continuing to command said displacement when said modulation detector means
(5-5') have detected modulation of said signal from said optical power detector

(6-3') include means for applying to said filter a ramp control signal of lower
slope, in absolute value, than the ramp control signal applied to said filter when

said modulation detector means have not detected modulation of said signal
from said optical power detector.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that, when used in the receive part
of an optical transmission system, said modulation detector means are means for

detecting the modulation of a signal from a receiver (3) implementing the receive
function.
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that, when the information
conveyed by said system is digital information, said signal from said receiver is a

clock signal (H) with a clock rate corresponding to the transmission rate of said
information.
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that, when said optical noise
comprises noise created by a receive optical preamplifier (2), said modulation

detector means (5') include:

measuring means (7') for measuring a magnitude characteristic of the
amplitude of said clock signal, said measuring means having a bandwidth which

can be restricted to the frequency of said clock signal,
means (9') for comparing the result provided by said measuring means with
a specific threshold so that, depending on whether the signal received by said

optical power detector is entirely constituted of said optical noise or not, the result
supplied by said measuring means is differently situated relative to said threshold.
