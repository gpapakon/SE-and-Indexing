<ABSTRACT>
Sound insulation, with respect to a vehicle, of the body of a hydraulic unit (10) forming part of a controlled-slip braking system against a vehicle is to be improved. The hydraulic unit (10) is supported elastically on the vehicle beneath its centre of gravity (21) on three rubber spring components (31, 32, 33) which lie both in front of and behind a vertical projection of the centre of gravity (21) and symmetrically in and on either side of a vertical plane (22) containing said centre of gravity (21). In addition, the three rubber spring components (31, 32, 33) are arranged along the outside (39) of an imaginary cylinder in the horizontal longitudinal axis (40) of which lies the centre of gravity (21) of the hydraulic unit (10). The rubber spring components (31, 32, 33) take the form of disc springs, the fronts (34, 35) of which, which bear securing means (36), extend approximately tangentially to the outside (39) of the imaginary cylinder.

Hydraulic unit (10) which is supported in such a 
way as to damp vibration and forms part of a slip-controlled 

brake system of a vehicle, especially a passenger 
vehicle, having at least one reciprocating-piston pump 

(18, 19) and the following features: 

the longitudinal axis (20) of the reciprocating 
piston (16, 17) of the pump (18, 19), which is 

actuated by a rotating, horizontally extending 
eccentric shaft (15), runs at a distance from the 

centre of gravity (21) of the hydraulic unit (10), 
the housing (11) of the hydraulic unit (10) is 
supported elastically on the vehicle by three rubber 

spring elements (31, 32, 33), 
in relation to a vertical plane (22) passing through 
the centre of gravity (21) and the longitudinal axis 

(14) of the eccentric shaft (15), the rubber spring 
elements (31, 32, 33) are, as seen in the direction 

of the shaft longitudinal axis (14), arranged both 
in 
front of and behind a vertical projection of the 
centre of gravity (21) and symmetrically and on both 

sides of the vertical plane (22), 
 
characterized by the following further features: 


the three rubber spring elements (31, 32, 33) are 
arranged below the centre of gravity (21) of the 

hydraulic unit (10), 
the three rubber spring elements (31, 32, 33) are 
arranged along the lateral surface (39) of an imaginary 

circular cylinder, on the horizontally 
extending longitudinal axis (40), which also runs 

parallel to the longitudinal axis (14) of the eccentric  
 

shaft (15), of which the centre of gravity 
(21) of the hydraulic unit (10) lies, 
the rubber spring elements (31, 32, 33) are designed 
as disc springs, the ends (34, 35) of which, which 

carry fastening means (36), extend approximately 
tangentially to the lateral surface (39) of the 

imaginary circular cylinder. 
Hydraulic unit according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the rubber spring elements 

(31, 32, 33) are, on the one hand, fastened at least 
indirectly to the housing (11) of the hydraulic unit (10) 

and are, on the other hand, connected to a holder (30) 
designed as a sheet-metal shaped part which is intended 

for fastening to the vehicle.
