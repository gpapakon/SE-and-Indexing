<ABSTRACT>
Device for attenuating vehicle rolling (running) noise, mounted on a component 3 connected to the wheel. This device is characterised in that it includes an annular mass 5 coaxial with the wheel shaft 2 and several actuators of the slaved linear motor type 6 to 8 acting radially between the said mass 5 and the said component 3. Advantageously, the said motors 6 to 8 are variable-reluctance motors. The device also includes elastic members 9 around the said shaft 2 and capable of storing up static loads exerted between the inertial mass or masses 5 and said component 3. The actuators and their power-supply alternators may be accommodated in the wheel rims.

Device for attenuating rolling noise or vibrations
of the wheels of vehicles, including, for one wheel,

one or more inertial masses (5) distributed about the shaft
(2, 2') of said wheel, these masses (5) being connected to

a component (3) fixed in rotation, said masses being
connected to the wheel so as to receive vibravions from it,

characterized in that these masses (5) are connected by
controlled actuators (6 to 8, 6' to 8'), which are variable-reluctance

motors, to this component (3') fixed in rotation,
component such as spindle (3) of the said shaft (2, 2') or

alternatively to a rotating component (3, 3") which is
joined to the wheel so as to receive the vibrations therefrom,

component such as a rim (3") of said wheel.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in
that it includes elastic members (9) capable of withstanding

the static loads exerted between the inertial mass or masses
(5, 6; 5', 6') and said component (3, 3').
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that it includes an additional stage (12, 13) for

filtering out the vibrations, located between the said
component (3) and a rigid casing (11) mounted on the wheel

shaft (2) by means of rolling-contact bearings (1).
Device according to claim 3, characterized in
that the said filtering stage includes elastomer blocks (12)

with low radial stiffness, and elastomer blocks (13) acting
as axial limit stops with high stiffness.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the inertial mass or masses

(5) and the actuators are mounted towards the inside, with
respect to the said spindle (3).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the variable reluctance actuators (6' to 8')

constituted by linear motors with variable reluctance are
mounted in the rim (3") of the wheel, like an alternator for 

their powering.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that said spindle (3) is secured to an accelerometer (A)

capable of providing signals representing the accelerations
in the vertical (z) and horizontal (x) directions urging the

wheel.
Device according to claim 3 or 4, characterized
in that it includes a reference accelerometer (Ar) secured

to the said rigid casing (11) and capable of providing
signals representing accelerations in the vertical (z) and

horizontal (x) directions urging the wheel, and an accelerometer
(AE) secured to the spindle (3) and providing signals

representing residual accelerations in the said directions,
these various signals being used in an algorithm of the

"feed-forward" type.
Device according to claim 6, characterized in
that the alternator includes a stator (20) secured to a disc

brake calliper (25), and a rotor (21), the armature turns
(23, 24) of which are connected to the coils (7') of the

actuators.
Device according to claim 9, including two pairs
of actuators (6-7, 6'-7') diametrically opposite one another

in pairs, characterized in that said rotor (21) includes two
armature turns (23, 24) offset by 90Â° with respect to each

other.
Device according to claim 9, characterized in
that the rotor (21) of the alternator powers the said

actuators (6'-7') via a rectifier circuit (29) and a
computer (28).
