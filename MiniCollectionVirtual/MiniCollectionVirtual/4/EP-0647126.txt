<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to component
mixing. More particularly, the invention concerns an apparatus
for separately storing a first component, such as a drug and
for mixing this first component with a second component, such
as a sterilized diluent, to form a beneficial agent which can
be delivered to a patient from the container containing the
second component. The device includes novel means for interconnecting
a container, such as a glass vial containing the
first component, with a flexible bag containing the second
component and then for mixing the components under sterile
conditions.In the past, pharmaceuticals have been provided by drug
manufacturers in sterilized vials, typically of glass construction.
When the pharmaceuticals are in powder form, they are
generally administered to the patient within a carrier liquid
by standard intravenous procedures. Such carrier liquids
include saline solution, dextrose solution and sterilized
water.Mixing of the powdered pharmaceuticals with the carrier
liquid has been accomplished in several ways many of them being
quite crude. For example, a common practice is to inject a
quantity of the liquid carrier into the vial to dissolve the 
powdered component. Then using a cannula and syringe, the
solution thus formed is injected into a larger container such
as a flexbag containing the liquid carrier. This method is
quite tedious and provides substantial opportunities for contamination
and error.In those instances where the pharmaceutical must be diluted
before delivery to a patient, as is the case with powered
pharmaceuticals, the pharmaceutical can also be injected directly
into a container of diluent and the container then
interconnected with a suitable administration set for intravenous
delivery of the solution to a patient. As a general
rule, the diluent is packaged in glass bottles, or flexible
plastic containers such as those sold under the names MINI-BAGtm
and VIAFLEXR by Travenol Laboratories, Inc. of Deerfield,
Illinois. These containers are conveniently provided
with administration ports for connection to the administration
set which delivers the container contents from the container to
the patient. The pharmaceutical is typically added to the
container through some type of an inlet port or vial receptacle
provided on the container.Because infusion of medicaments is most often accomplished
in a hospital environment, it is the nurse, doctor or medical
technician who mixes the drug and diluent usually at one time
shortly before administration
