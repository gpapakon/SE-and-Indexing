<ABSTRACT>
A phase locked loop (22) that generates an output clock 
signal has a phase/frequency circuit (12), a charge pump circuit 

(14), a voltage controlled oscillator circuit (16), a first divide-by 
circuit (24) and a second divide-by circuit (18). The 

phase/frequency circuit generates a first control signal 
responsive to a predetermined phase relationship between a first 

and a second clock signal. The charge pump circuit generates a 
voltage responsive to the first control signal. The voltage 

controlled oscillator circuit generates a third clock signal 
responsive to the voltage. The first and second divide-by circuits 

serially reduce the frequency of the third clock cycle by a first 
and a second ratio, respectively. The first ratio is controlled by a 

second control signal. The output of the first divide-by circuit 
generates the output clock signal. The output of the second 

divide-by circuit generates the first clock signal. The phase 
locked loop has a less onerous VCO bandwidth requirement for a 

given operating environment and has a reduced phase lock time 
when changing ratios of input to output clock frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to phase locked 
loops, and more specifically to a phase locked loop with improved 
frequency bandwidth. Phase locked loops (PLLs) are a class of devices that match 
the phase and frequency of a reference clock signal with the phase 
and frequency of an output clock signal. PLLs are widely used in 
frequency modulation (FM) radio and digital computing 
applications. Some PLLs generate an output clock signal with a frequency 
which is some multiple of the reference clock signal frequency. 
This modification may be advantageous in radio applications in 
which the radio transmits and receives at some multiple of a 
commonly available reference clock signal. This modification may 
also be advantageous to data processing systems in which the 
data processor operates at some multiple of an input reference 
clock signal, such as a bus clock signal. Divide-by-P circuits (where P is an integer) can be used to 
generate the frequency modification described above. A divide-by-P 
circuit can be interposed between the reference clock signal 
and the PLL's input to generate an output clock signal that is (1/P) 
times as slow as the reference clock signal. Conversely, a divide-by-M 
circuit (where M is an integer) can be interposed in the 
feedback loop of the output clock signal to generate an output 
clock signal that is (M) times as fast as the reference clock 
signal.  FIG. 1 depicts a block diagram of a phase locked loop 10 
known in the art. PLL 10 has a phase/frequency detector 12, a 
charge pump 14, a voltage controlled oscillator (hereafter simply 
"VCO") 16, a divide-by-M circuit 18 and a divide-by-P circuit 20, 
where M and P are integers. The operation of PLL 10 is known by one skilled in the art. 
In general, PLL 10 generates an output clock signal, PLL OUT, that 
has a predetermined phase and frequency relationship to an input 
signal REFERENCE CLOCK. In particular, PLL 10 dynamically 
adjusts the phase and frequency of the output clock signal PLL 
OUT to match the phase and frequency of the reference clock 
signal. Phase/frequency detector 12 receives the two clock signals 
and generates UP and DOWN control signals. If the clock signal 
output by divide-by-M circuit 18 has a lower frequency than the 
clock signal output by divide-by-P circuit 20, then 
phase/frequency detector 12 asserts the UP signal. Conversely, if 
the clock signal output by divide-by-M circuit 18 has a higher 
frequency than the clock signal output by divide-by-P circuit 20, 
then
