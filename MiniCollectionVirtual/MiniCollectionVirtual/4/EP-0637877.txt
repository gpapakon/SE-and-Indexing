<ABSTRACT>
An input terminal (2) for data is provided to a control circuit (1) that is coupled (3) to a power supply. Outputs (1l, 1R) connect to an energy transmitting coil (7) with a parallel capacitor (6) that serves as an oscillator. A further input terminal (1i) provides voltage feedback for the oscillator via a capacitor (10) and resistor (9). Other connections (1g, 1f) connect to a data transmission coil (8). A further input terminal (1h), with a series capacitor (10) and resistor (11), serves as a phase measurement input for the coil. The coil connects via capacitors (14, 17), diodes (15, 16) and resistors (13, 18) to earth.
