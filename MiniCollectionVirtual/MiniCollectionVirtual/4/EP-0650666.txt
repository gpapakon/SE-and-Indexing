<ABSTRACT>
A self-closing valve (14) for flushing drip-irrigation 
lines (10) at the beginning of every 

irrigation cycle. The valve (14) comprises a housing (16) 
defining an enclosed space, having an inlet portion (16c) 

mountable to the line end, allowing free communication 
with the water of the line (10). The housing (16c) 

comprises an elastic membrane (24) dividing the enclosed 
space into upstream and downstream compartments (S1, S2) 

with respect to said flow, with a passage communicating 
between the said compartments. A discharge opening (34) 

is formed in the upstream compartment (S1). Flow impeding 
means are associated with said passage (26) for 

restricting the flow of water from the upstream 
compartment (S1) into the downstream compartment (S2), said 

flow being effective to flex the membrane (24) in the 
upstream direction until it closes against the discharge 

opening (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to irrigation systems, 
in particular to drip-emitters irrigation lines. Still 
more specifically the invention concerns self-closing 
flushing valves that are installed at the end of the 
irrigation line for effecting flushing of the line at the 
beginning of every irrigation cycle, thus avoiding the 
clogging of the emitters through removal of particles, 
sediments and other impurities from the water. Self-closing flushing valves for the purposes above 
described are known. For example, in US-A-4 427 174, 
corresponding to Israel Patent 
No. 60774 there has been disclosed a flushing valve based 
on the coaction between a pair of membranes, one 
controlling the outlet of a flush water discharge outlet, 
and the other responsive for closing the first membrane 
after a certain pressure has been built-up between the 
membranes.  
 More specifically US-A-4427174 discloses an irrigation 
system flushing valve comprising a housing, a coupling inlet of 
said housing for coupling to an end of an irrigation line, a 
flushing valve outlet of said housing, a valve seating formed 
in said housing communicating with said inlet and with said 
outlet, valve obturating means juxtaposed with respect to said 
seating and displaceable with respect thereto from a sealing 
position wherein said inlet is closed with respect to said 
outlet to an open position wherein said inlet communicates 
with said outlet; an extensible membrane mounted in said 
housing and defining with said obturating means a valve 
enclosure located within said housing and sealed with respect 
to said outlet by said obturating means and flow restricting 
means effecting flow communication between said inlet and said 
valve enclosure; the arrangement being such that the hydraulic 
pressures in said valve enclosure and said inlet respectively 
act on opposite surfaces of said obturating means and when the 
hydraulic pressure in said valve enclosure equals or exceeds 
that in said inlet said obturating means is biased into said 
sealing position.  
 This type of flushing valves suffers from numerous 
disadvantages, mainly and in that its operation is based 
on a pressure equilibrium condition, which is difficult 
to preset and is liable to be effected by different 
operating conditions of the line, e.g. pressure, amount 
of flow, etc. Furthermore, the structure is based on an 
in-line emitter unit installed therein, and generally  
 
comprises a relatively large number of components some of 
which are of non-standard design

<CLAIMS>
A self-closing valve (14) for flushing drip-irrigation 
lines (10) comprising a housing (16) 

having an inlet 
portion (16c) mountable to the line (10) end, 

allowing free communication with the water of the 
line (10), the housing (16, 124) comprising: 


an elastic membrane (24) 
defining an upstream (S
1
) and a downstream (S
2
) 
compartment with respect to the flow; 
passage means communicating between the said 
compartments (S
1
, S
2
); 
a discharge opening (34, 134) formed in the upstream 
compartment (S
1
); 
flow restricting means associated with said passage 
means for restricting the flow of water from the 

upstream compartment (S
1
) into the downstream 
compartment (S
2
) said flow being effective to flex 
the membrane (24, 124) in the upstream direction; and 
means cooperating with the membrane (24, 124) in its 
flexed state to close against the said discharge 

opening (34, 134); 
 
characterized in that said passage means comprise a passage opening (26;38;146) 

through said membrane (24, 124), and in that the flow restricting means are constituted 
by the cross-section of said passage opening (26;38;146) being substantially 

smaller than that of said discharge opening (34, 134).  
 
The valve (14) according to Claim 1 further 
comprising means for increasing the velocity of the 

water flow from said line (10) end and directing 
same towards the said passage means.  

 
The valve (14) according to the Claim 2 wherein the 
said passage consists of an opening (26) formed in 

the membrane (24), the cross-section thereof being 
substantially smaller than that of the said 

discharge opening (34). 
The valve (14) according to Claim 2 wherein the flow 
velocity increasing means comprise a flow 

restriction portion (30) formed at the said housing 
inlet portion 16c, said passage means being in 

register with the housing inlet portion (16c).

clogging preventing means comprise a needle-like 

member (36) passing the opening (26) and being 
stationary relative to the membrane (24).
