<ABSTRACT>
In a nuclear power station steam generator a device (48) is provided for preventing objects originating from the driers (36), following fitting, subsequent intervention or else accidental detachment in operation, from being jammed between the tubes (24) of the generator. This device (48) which, for example, takes the form of a grid, is placed above a horizontal plate (34) to which are secured the top ends of the conduits (32) containing the cyclone separators. It defines passages whose largest dimensions are smaller than the minimum distance separating the tubes (24).

Steam generator comprising: 

a vertically axed envelope (10), 
a horizontal tube sheet (12) tightly fixed within the envelope, 
a bundle (24) of inverted U-tubes, each having two ends fixed to the tube 
sheet and issuing below the latter, respectively into an admission collector 

(16) and a discharge collector (18) for the primary fluid, 
means (42, 44) for supplying secondary water issuing into the envelope 
(10) above the horizontal tube sheet (12) and 
secondary steam extraction means (32, 36, 38) placed in the envelope 
(10) above the bundle (24) of tubes and having substantially vertical discharge 

pipes (32) placed below the drying means (36), 
 
characterized in that the migrating body trapping means (48) are placed 

between the discharge pipes (32) and the drying means (36), at least above 
each of the pipes (32), the migrating body trapping means (48) defining 

passages having a maximum dimension smaller than the minimum distance 
separating the tubes (24) of the bundle. 
Steam generator according to claim 1, characterized in that the migrating 
body trapping means (48) occupy substantially the entire cross-section 

of the envelope (10). 
Steam generator according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
migrating body trapping means (48) are formed from separate assemblies and 

placed in the upper part of each of the discharge pipes (32). 
Steam generator according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the migrating body trapping means (48) incorporate several 

trapping elements (50) placed above a horizontal plate (31) to which are 
fixed the upper ends of the discharge pipes (32). 
Steam generator according to claim 4, characterized in that each 
trapping element (50) incorporates a carrying structure (56) forming a 

floor, on which is placed a trapping grating (58). 
Steam generator according to either of the claims 4 and 5, characterized 
in that each trapping element (50) is fixed by dismantlable fixing means 

(54) to horizontal joists (52) located above said horizontal plate (34).
