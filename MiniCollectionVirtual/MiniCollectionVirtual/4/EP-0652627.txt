<ABSTRACT>
A rotary generator comprises a rotor (23) within a stator (24) 
having end windings (26), the rotor (23) defining a flow path for 

cooling fluid which, during rotation of the rotor (23) forms an 
annular layer (43,44) in the rotor. A cooling fluid feed means 

(45,46) is provided having an inlet (54) which, in use, is 
positioned within the annular layer (43,44) of cooling fluid 

whereby a head of cooling fluid is formed at the inlet (54). The 
feed means (45,46) defines a duct through which the cooling fluid 

passes by the action of centrifugal force towards an outlet (56) 
from which cooling fluid is directed onto the end windings (26). 

The rotation of the rotor causes the head of fluid at the inlet 
(54) to reduce with increasing rotational speed thereby effecting 

control of cooling fluid flow through the feed means (45,46) as 
the rotational speed of the rotor (23) increases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rotary generator and is particularly
concerned with a rotary generator which includes a stator having
end windings and which provides for cooling of the end windings
by means of a cooling fluid fed by centrifugal action.It has been proposed in International Patent Application
No.WO91/07003 to cool stator end windings by means of a cooling
fluid fed centrifugally through a radial tube having a cooling
orifice through which the fluid sprays onto the end windings. In
order to provide a reasonably steady flow of cooling fluid for the
end windings it is necessary in WO91/07003 to provide the radial
tube with a variable orifice for limiting flow of cooling fluid when
the generator operates at higher speeds. The arrangement
requires the provision of a ball for varying the orifice and a
biasing spring which acts upon the ball and the system is,
therefore, somewhat complex.International Patent Application No. WO 80/01629 describes a
rotary generator in which cooling fluid is pumped by a
pressurizing means through an orifice of constant size. However
the velocity at which the cooling fluid which leaves outlet nozzles
will vary considerably with changes in rotational speed.An object of the present invention is to provide a rotary generator
having an improved system for cooling the stator end windings.According to the invention there is provided a rotary generator 
comprising a rotor within a stator having end windings, the rotor defining a flow path
for cooling fluid, a cooling fluid feed means having an inlet and an outlet of fixed
size, the inlet in use, receiving cooling fluid and the feed means defining a duct
through which the cooling fluid passes towards the outlet from which the cooling
fluid is directed onto the end windings, characterised in that during rotation of the
rotor, the cooling fluid forms an annular layer in the rotor having its radially inner
boundary surrounding a core of air, the inlet for the cooling fluid feed means being
positioned within the annular layer radially inwards of the outer boundary thereof
such that a head of cooling fluid is formed at the inlet between the inlet and the core
of air, the cooling fluid being arranged to pass through the duct by the action of
centrifugal force during rotation of the rotor, the inner boundary of the annular layer
moving closer to the inlet with increasing rotational speed thereby causing the head
of fluid at the inlet to reduce and thereby effecting control of cooling fluid through
the feed means as the rotational
