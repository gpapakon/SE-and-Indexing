<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a sensitivity 
enhancer for antineoplastic agents which contains 

as the active ingredient an indolocarbazole 
derivative represented by general formula 

(I) or a pharmacologically acceptable 
salt thereof, wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, 

lower alkyl or lower alkanoyl; A represents 
a group represented by general formula (1) 

(wherein R² represents hydrogen, lower alkyl 
or lower alkanoyl, and R³ represents hydrogen 

or lower alkyl) when one of W¹ and W² 
represents hydrogen and the other thereof represents 

hydrogen or hydroxy, or alternatively 
W¹ and W² are combined together to represent 

oxygen, excluding the case where all of 
the R¹, R², W¹ and W² are hydrogen atoms 

and R³ is methyl; or A represents a group 

represented by general formula (2) [wherein 
X represents a single bond or -CO-; m represents 

an integer of 0 to 6; and Y represents 
hydrogen, OR⁴ (wherein R⁴ represents 

hydrogen, lower alkyl, aralkyl or CONR⁵R⁶, 
wherein R⁵ and R⁶ represent each independently 

hydrogen or lower alkyl, or alternatively 
R⁵ and R⁶ are combined together to 

form a heterocyclic group together with the 
nitrogen atom to which they are bonded), 

NR⁷R⁸ (wherein R⁷ and R⁸ represent each independently 
hydrogen or lower alkyl, or alternatively R⁷ and R⁸ are combined together to form a heterocyclic group 

together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded), or (un)substituted aryl] when R¹ represents lower alkyl or 

lower alkanoyl and one of W¹ and W² represents hydrogen while the other thereof represents hydrogen or hydroxy, or 
when R¹ represents hydrogen and one of W¹ and W² represents hydrogen while the other thereof represents hydroxy. 

The invention also provides another indolocarbazole derivative represented by general formula (II) or a pharmacologically 
acceptable salt thereof, wherein R
1a
 represents lower alkyl or lower alkanoyl; W represents hydrogen or hydroxy; 
and R
4a
 represents lower alkyl.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an agent for 
potentiating sensitivity to an antitumor agent. Clinical use of antitumor agents in chemotherapy 
for cancers has involved the problem of resistance to the 
antitumor agents. Some kinds of cancers are known to 
acquire multiple drug resistance and become refractory to 
the actions of many antitumor agents. As the compounds 
which are effective to overcome multiple drug resistance, 
Verapamil [Yuki Gosei Kagaku, 49, 980(1991)] and the like, 
and indolocarbazole derivatives, such as NA381, NA382, and 
NA478 [Cancer Letters, 64, 177(1992); J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 
45, 43(1993); and J. Antibiotics, 46, 353(1993)] are known. 
   Indolocarbazole derivatives having antitumor 
activity are also known (WO 89/07105; and Japanese Published 
Unexamined Patent Application Nos. 295588/88 and 295589/88). The present invention relates to an agent for 
potentiating sensitivity to an antitumor agent comprising, 
as an active ingredient, an indolocarbazole derivative  
 
represented by formula (I): 
wherein
 
when R¹ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, or lower alkanoyl, 
and one of W¹ and W² represents hydrogen with the other 
representing hydrogen or hydroxy, or alternatively W¹ and W² 
are combined to represent oxygen, then A represents 
(wherein R² represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, or lower 
alkanoyl; and R³ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl) with 
the proviso that when R¹, R², W¹, and W² are hydrogen, then 
R³ is hydrogen or other lower alkyl than methyl;
 
when R¹ represents lower alkyl or lower alkanoyl, and one of 
W¹ and W² represents hydrogen with the other representing 
hydrogen or hydroxy, or when R¹ represents hydrogen, and one 
of W¹ and W² represents hydrogen with the other representing 
hydroxy, then A represents 
[wherein X represents a single bond or -CO-; m represents an  
 
integer of 0 to 6; and Y represents hydrogen, OR⁴ (wherein 
R⁴ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, aralkyl, or CONR⁵R⁶, 
wherein R⁵ and R⁶ independently represent hydrogen or lower 
alkyl, or alternatively R⁵ and R⁶ are taken together with 
the nitrogen atom to form a heterocyclic group), NR⁷R⁸ 
(wherein R⁷ and R⁸ independently represent hydrogen or lower 
alkyl, or alternatively R⁷ and R⁸ are taken together with 
the nitrogen atom to form a heterocyclic group), or 
substituted or unsubstituted aryl;
 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The present invention further relates to a method 
for potentiating sensitivity to an antitumor agent 
comprising administration of an effective amount
