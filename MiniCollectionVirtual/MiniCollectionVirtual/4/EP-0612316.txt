A process for preparing methylpyrazoles of the 
general formulae Ia and Ib 


 
where R is hydrogen, C
1
-C
6
-alkyl or unsubstituted or 
substituted phenyl, from diacetylene and hydrazines, 

wherein 

a) a part stream which contains the diacetylene is 
removed from the product gas resulting from acetylene 

production by reversible absorption in a polar 
liquid or a mixture of high-boiling hydrocarbons, 

and is, where appropriate, diluted with a diluent, 
and 
b) this part stream is reacted without further physical 
or chemical treatment with hydrazines of the general 

formula II 

RHN-NH
2
 
where R has the abovementioned meaning, at from -40 

to +150Â°C under atmospheric pressure. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
polar liquid or the hydrocarbon is water, an alcohol, a 

ketone, benzene, toluene, xylene, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone 
or a mixture thereof.  

 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
inert gas is a mixture of low-boiling hydrocarbons, 

hydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, natural gas, acetylene 
or a mixture of these gases. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
polar liquid is N-methylpyrrolidone. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
inert gas is natural gas. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
diacetylene content after the dilution with inert gas is 

from 5 to 30% by volume. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
hydrazines are employed in pure form, in aqueous solution 

or as solutions in protic or aprotic solvents. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein unreacted 
hydrazine is returned to the reaction. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
reversible absorption of the diacetylene in process step 

a) takes place by a prewash of the product gas containing 
all the acetylene with the polar liquid, degassing the 

absorbent in a vacuum stripper, subsequently washing out 
the absorbent which is still present in the gas stream 

with water, and cooling the diacetylene-containing gas.
