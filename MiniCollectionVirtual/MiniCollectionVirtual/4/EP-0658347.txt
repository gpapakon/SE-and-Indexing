<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing an injectable pharmaceutical or veterinary composition 
which comprises either diclofenac or a salt thereof and 2-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin, 

or an inclusion complex of diclofenac or a salt thereof and 2-hydroxypropyl 
beta-cyclodextrin, includes the step of dissolving either the 

diclofenac or salt thereof and the 2-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin, or the 
inclusion complex, in water to form a solution, the water having been acidified 

to a pH such that the pH of the solution is from 6,0 to 8,5 inclusive, in the 
absence of a phosphate buffer. The composition so produced has good stability 

on storage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing an injectable pharmaceutical or
veterinary composition comprising either a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt of diclofenac and 2-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin, or an inclusion
complex of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of diclofenac and
2-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin, and to an injectable composition so formed.Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which inhibits the
synthesis of prostaglandins by acetylation of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase.
Prostaglandins that are released by trauma and various other stimuli do not
cause pain directly but cause hyperalgesia by increasing the sensitivity of nerve
endings to the effects of pain-producing substances. In order for a drug to achieve maximal relief of acute pain or prevent post-operative
pain, the drug should reach the systemic circulation as soon as
possible after administration. This is achieved by intravenous administration.Further, in certain circumstances, oral administration of drugs is not possible
or desirable. For example, acute painful conditions, e.g. migraine, trauma,
dysmenorrhoea and renal or biliary colic are often accompanied by nausea and
vomiting, rendering the oral route of administration ineffective. Gastric
emptying may also be delayed under these conditions. Further, surgical patients
are usually fasted during the peri-operative period and the parenteral route is
indicated for administration of analgesic drugs at this time.There is thus a need for an injectable composition containing diclofenac or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the treatment of both acute painful
conditions and post-operative patients.However, the solubility of diclofenac and its sodium salt are very limited in
aqueous solutions around physiological pH. Parenteral or injectable
formulations of diclofenac or diclofenac sodium have therefore necessitated the
use of solubilizing additives such as propylene glycol. Commercial
formulations suffer from a strict limitation to deep intramuscular injection.In a paper in International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 74 (1991) 85-93, entitled
"Interaction of NSA with cyclodextrins and hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin
derivatives" by Backensfeld, MÃ¼ller and Kolter, there is disclosed a study to
increase the aqueous solubility and stability of the NSA indomethacin,
diclofenac and piroxicam with hydroxyalkylated cyclodextrin derivatives.
Diclofenac solutions with and without oxygen were prepared for the stability
tests of diclofenac. The solutions were prepared by
