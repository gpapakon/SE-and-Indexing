<ABSTRACT>
A pressure sensitive adhesive is obtainable by a process comprising polymerizing an ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid having a non-tertiary alcohol comprising 4 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain (component A) in the presence of at least one kind of a naturally occuring polysaccharide except hydrolyzed starch, cellulose ethers and cellulose esters (component B); radical chain initiators (component C). The pressure sensitive articles manufactured from the pressure sensitive adhesive have improved properties. In particular, the articles are repositionable and the adhesion under humid conditions is improved when cellulose powder is used as component B.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a pressure sensitive
adhesive having a filler, a method for preparing the
respective pressure sensitive adhesive, as well as
products manufactured by using the pressure sensitive
adhesive which products are self-supporting adhesive
sheet materials, or sheet materials arranged on a
flexible backing in form of a film, a tape or ribbon.It has been known for many years that
additives can alter the properties of normally tacky
pressure sensitive adhesives. Tackifiers and
plasticiziers have been used often to modify the
adhesive mechanical properties and adhesive behaviour.
Insoluble particulate or fibrous fillers have been used
as well, often with the objective of reducing costs
and building suitable viscosity for coating of the
pressure sensitive adhesive onto a substrate.Fillers have been found to be especially
useful as additives to acrylic pressure sensitive
adhesives. Known fillers for this group of adhesives
are hydrophobic fumed silica, glass microbubbles,
polymeric microspheres, organic filaments and glass
fibers, in addition to more traditional fillers such as
calcium carbonate and titanium dioxide.Klingen et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,710,536,
discloses an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive tape
with incorporated hydrophobic silica. Such pressure
sensitive adhesive tape shows an improved shear
strength at elevated temperatures whereas adhesion and
physical properties are maintained or improved. The
hydrophobic silica preferably has a surface area from
50 to 400 m2/g. A preferred acrylic pressure sensitive
adhesive layer comprises copolymer of (a) at least one
alkyl acrylate having an average of 4 - 12 carbon atoms
in its alkyl group and (b) from 3 to 20 % by weight of 
copolymerizable monomer having a polar group such as
acrylic acid.Levens discloses in U.S. Patent No. 4,223,067
a pressure sensitive adhesive tape, the adhesive layer
of which is a void-free matrix of a pressure-sensitive
adhesive polymer and glass microbubbles and has the
appearance of a foam-backed tape. The adhesive layer
is fairly elastic under briefly applied stresses but
has low elasticity under prolonged stress and hence
conforms and adheres well to rough and uneven surfaces.
The microbubbles having an average diameter of 10 to
200 µm and comprising 20 to 65 volume percent of the
pressure sensitive adhesive layer. From this reference
it is known that glass beads can be used as fine
particle fillers in a polyacrylate elastomer matrix
(Blackley and Sheikh "particulate reinforcement of
polyacrylate elastomers",
