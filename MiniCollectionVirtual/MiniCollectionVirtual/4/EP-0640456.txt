<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic article can be injection molded 
in a mold (10) which comprises a cavity (28) defining the 

shape of the article, at least one thermoplastic entry 
aperture (23) which is adapted to receive molten 

thermoplastic resin from a nozzle (22) of an injection 
molding machine (24), a thermoplastic flow path (21, 26, 

30) communicating with the thermoplastic entry aperture and 
the cavity, and a fluid flow passageway (32, 34) extending 

into the mold. The fluid flow passageway extends from an 
exterior surface of the mold to the thermoplastic flow 

path. A low viscosity fluid such as a gas can be injected 
through the fluid flow passageway and into the 

thermoplastic flow path. An end portion (44) of the fluid 
flow passagewa
y adjacent the thermoplastic flow path has a 
porous metal plug (50) disposed therein. The porous metal 

plug comprises a porous metal core (64) which permits the 
low viscosity fluid to flow therethrough but prevents the 

passage of molten plastic therethrough. The porous metal 
core can comprise a sintered metal. Alternatively, the 

fluid flow passageway can extend from an exterior surface 
of the mold directly to the mold cavity, rather than the 

thermoplastic flow path.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas-assisted injection 
molding of thermoplastic articles. In one of its aspects, 
the invention relates to a mold having an improved means 
for injecting a fluid such as a gas into an injected 
thermoplastic material. In another of its aspects, the 
invention relates to a process for injection molding a 
thermoplastic article wherein a fluid such as a gas is 
injected into the molten thermoplastic through an improved 
plug which permits passage of the fluid therethrough but 
which prohibits flow of thermoplastic material 
therethrough. British Patent Specification No. 2 139 548 
discloses a process for injection molding comprising the 
steps of introducing plastic material into a mold cavity 
and, at one or more selected positions, separately 
introducing a pressurized fluid such as a gas into the 
stream of plastics material to thereby fill the mold cavity 
and create a gas-containing cavity in the plastic material. 
The plastic material flows throughout the mold cavity with 
the gas-containing cavity within the plastic material. The 
gas pressure is maintained within the gas-containing cavity 
to hold the plastic material positively against the mold 
surfaces as the plastic material solidifies and cools to 
the point where the molding can sustain the form dictated 
by the mold surfaces. In one embodiment, the pressurized gas is 
introduced at a position within the mold cavity, and in an 
alternative embodiment, the gas is introduced upstream of 
the mold cavity. In each embodiment, the gas is introduced 
through a passageway after the outlet end of the passageway 
has been immersed in the plastic material, the gas entering 
the plastic material and forming the gas-containing cavity 
therein. At the end of the molding cycle, the gas pressure 
within the gas-containing cavity is relieved before the 
mold is opened.  
 US-A 4,740,150 was intended to be an improvement 
over the gas injection molding system disclosed in the 
British Patent Specification No. 2 139 548. US-A 4,740,150 
discloses a retractable gas injection nozzle adapted to be 
positioned either within the mold cavity or upstream of the 
mold cavity. In its protracted position, the gas injection 
nozzle is capable of introducing gas into the mold via a 
bore extending longitudinally through the nozzle, the bore 
being connected to a source of pressurized gas. The gas 
can be vented from the mold by retracting the nozzle away 
from sealing engagement with a conical valve seat of a 
valve port in the mold. In the
