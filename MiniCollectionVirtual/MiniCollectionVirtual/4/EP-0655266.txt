<ABSTRACT>
The artificial moving bed of this invention includes 
a fluid distribution apparatus consisting of an upper 

fluid distributor and a lower fluid distributor, and a 
plurality of processing chambers held and fixed between 

the upper and lower fluid distributors. Each fluid 
distributor has a rotary valve held in a slidable 

condition between a fixed supply valve and a pipe fixing 
plate. These fluid distributors are formed with fluid 

passages therein. The processing chambers are divided 
into several groups, each assigned a specific process. 

Using this artificial moving bed, the processing chambers 
are operated simultaneously and when the process is 

finished in each group of processing chambers, the fluid 

distribution apparatus is rotated clockwise when viewed 
from above so that each group of chambers proceeds to the 

next process, thus allowing continuous adsorption operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid distribution 
apparatus, to an artificial moving bed using the 
fluid distribution apparatus, and also to a continuous 
adsorption method for continuously operating adsorption 
chambers by using the artificial moving beds. As a means of separating and purifying fluids, an 
adsorption method has been in wide use which employs 
silica gel, activated carbon, zeolite and ion-exchange 
resins as adsorbents. Among representative adsorption methods are (a) the 
Parex method and the Molex method, which involve dividing 
an adsorbent-packed fixed bed into several stages and 
performing adsorption, desorption and regeneration 
processes successively and parallelly in the packed beds 
by manipulating a rotary switching valve. These methods 
produce effects similar to those obtained by the continuous 
countercurrent method using adsorbent-packed moving  
 
beds. The Parex method and the Molex method are employed 
for purifying paraxylene and oil refining, respectively 
(as described in UOPSORB-10-09-85, for example). Another known method (b) (for example, Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 32482/1985) connects a plurality 
of ordinary adsorption chambers with each other by pipes, 
feeds a liquid or fluid to be processed, an adsorption 
liquid and a regeneration liquid to each of the adsorption 
chambers, provides these adsorption chambers with 
piping and valves to extract these liquids from the 
chambers, and operates the valves successively according 
to a time schedule to perform such operations as adsorption, 
desorption and cleaning in parallel. In still another popular method (c) (for example, 
ADVANCE SEPARATION TECHNOLOGIES Inc. ISEP system), a 
number of adsorption chambers are fixedly mounted in 
circle on a circular rotatable stand; the rotatable stand 
is turned to rotate these adsorption chambers; an outlet 
pipe and an inlet pipe connected to each of the adsorption 
chambers are connected to a pair of upper and lower 
stationary valves; as the adsorption chambers are 
rotated, these liquids are supplied to each adsorption 
chamber successively through the stationary valves to 
carry out adsorption and desorption continuously.  
 From US-A-4923616 it is known a fluid distribution apparatus which has 
two discs, i.e. a stationary disc and a rotary disc. Two ports are necessary for 
the stationary disc to charge and discharge liquid, the diameter of the disc 
being large.  
 The first method (a) using the rotary valve normally 
have the flow inside the beds directed
