<ABSTRACT>
Gold/palladium alloys with a high gold content for dental applications ought, for biocompatibility reasons, not to contain any toxicologically objectionable constituents. The only non-noble metal constituent needed for particularly corrosion-resistant and biocompatible type 4 alloys is tin in amounts of from 0.7 to 5.8% by weight when the composition is kept within certain limits in the palladium/tin diagram. Alloys of this type contain besides gold and tin 6 to 25% by weight of palladium, 0 to 12% by weight of platinum and 0 to 2% by weight of iridium, rhodium and/or ruthenium.

<CLAIMS>
Use of gold/palladium alloys with an elevated gold
content consisting of 6 to 25 wt.% of palladium, 0 to

12 wt.% of platinum, 0 to 2 wt.% of iridium, rhodium
and/or ruthenium and 0.7 to 5.8 wt.% of tin,

remainder gold, for dental castings with and without
ceramic overlays, wherein,


a) at platinum contents of below 2 wt.%, the tin
content is within a range delimited on the

palladium/tin diagram by the points A, B, C and
D, where A = 6 Pd 1.3 Sn, B = 6 Pd 2.8 Sn, C =

25 Pd 5.8 Sn and D = 25 Pd 2.2 Sn;
b) at platinum contents of above 2 wt.%, the
permitted tin content is reduced by 0.12 wt.% of

tin per 2 wt.% of platinum content, and
c) the sum of palladium and platinum contents does
not exceed 30 wt.%.
Use of gold/palladium alloys with an elevated gold
content according to claim 1 consisting of 12 to

25 wt.% of palladium, 0 to 10 wt.% of platinum, 0 to
2 wt.% of iridium, rhodium and/or ruthenium, 2.1 to

5.0 wt.% of tin, remainder gold, wherein the tin
content is within a range delimited on the

palladium/tin diagram by the points A', B', C' and D,
where A' = 12 Pd 2.1 Sn, B' = 12 Pd 3.0 Sn, C' =

25 Pd 5.0 Sn and D has the above-stated meaning, and
additions of platinum bring about the same reduction

in tin content as in claim 1.
Use of gold/palladium alloys with an elevated gold
content according to claims 1 and 2 which are

delimited on the palladium/tin diagram by the points
A', B', C'' and D'', where C'' = 16 Pd 3.5 Sn, D'' = 

16 Pd 2.2 Sn, A' and B' have the above-stated
meaning.
Use of gold/palladium alloys with an elevated gold
content according to claim 1 consisting of 6 to

10 wt.% of palladium, 0 to 6 wt.% of platinum, 0 to
2 wt.% of iridium, rhodium and/or ruthenium, 1.3 to

3.4 [sic] tin, remainder gold, wherein the tin

content is within a range delimited on the
palladium/tin diagram by the points A, B, C''' and

D''', where C''' = 10 Pd 3.4 Sn, D''' = 10 Pd 1.5 Sn, A
and B have the above-stated meaning, and the sum of

palladium and platinum does not exceed 12 wt.%.
