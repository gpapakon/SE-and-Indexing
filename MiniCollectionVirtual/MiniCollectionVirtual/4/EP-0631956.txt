<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a drum winder (10), which 
comprises winding drums (11;12) that support the 

roll (13) that is being formed and in which the gap 
that is formed by the winding drums (11,12) and by 

the roll (13) that is being formed is pressurized. The 
cutter well (15) or a part of same has been formed 

as a sealed pressure chamber (15) so as to pressurize 
the gap that is formed by the winding drums 

(11;12) and by the roll (13) that is being formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a drum winder according to the preamble of claim 1, which is
based on DE-U-92 12 571.In drum winding, it is desirable to lower the nip loads produced by the weight of the
growing roll, because otherwise the linear loads that act upon the nips usually
become excessively high, which results in roll defects.With respect to the prior art, reference is made, for example, to the publications DE
1,047,001, DE 1,111,496, DE 3,618,955, and US 3,497,151. In these solutions that
are known from the prior art, it is known to pass a pressure into the gap formed by
the roll that is being formed and by the winding drums, whereby a relief effect is
applied to the roll that is formed, because of which effect the linear loads in the nips
cannot become excessively high. In order that the pressure should be retained in the
gap formed by the roll and by the winding drums, it is known from the prior art to
seal the gap from above and from below, respectively, by means of various sealing
constructions. From the paper DE 1,047,001, it is known to move the upper roll-end
sealing unit in the axial direction.From the paper US 3,346,209, it is known to regulate the pressure present in the gap
formed by the roll and by the winding drums by means of the lower drum by
moving the drum in the direction up-down.Even though, by means of the prior-art solutions described above, considerable
improvement is achieved, they, however, involve certain drawbacks. Sealing of the
gap formed by the roll that is formed and by the winding drums is, as a rule,
problematic. The pressure always leaks to some extent, which results in problems of 
dust formation. Owing to the leakage of the pressure, a very large quantity of air is
needed to maintain the pressure, which air spreads into the working environment, for
which reason the dust is readily separated from the web that is wound and spreads
into the working environment. On the other hand, the prior-art solutions restrict or
at least hamper some operations that are necessary in the roll formation. One of
these operations is, for example, the roll change, wherein, when the roll that is
wound becomes complete, a new roll spool must be fed into the gap between the
winding drums, the web that is wound must be cut off, and the end of the cut-off
web must be attached to the new roll spool. Thus, during roll change, various
actuators are needed, such as web holders, cutting means, devices for the feed of a
new roll spool, etc.The object of the invention is to provide an improvement over
