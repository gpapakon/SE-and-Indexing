<ABSTRACT>
It integrates the control unit to execute the 
programming in the core of the enclosure (1). The enclosure has 

also a window (2) where an alphanumeric display (3) is 
situated, another window (4) where an acceptance switch 

is placed (6), and two other windows (5-5') with both 
forward/backward switches (7-7'). With those switches we 

run over a menu. Thanks to the switch (6) we fix one of 
the menu options and then, repeating once more the 

process, we can enter a sub-menu, until we reach the 
level of any specific order.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coin or a token 
selector, the kind that is used in any machine which is 
able to provide a product, goods or a service, after 
having introduced the coins needed to pay the price. The 
selector has been slightly improved, concretely in order 
to obtain a larger autonomy from the point of view of 
programming and other applications that can be executed. As we know, coin selectors are usually able to 
detect the legal validity of the different types of 
coins, that is, coins that have different values. For 
this purpose, selectors have different electromagnetic 
tools that are able to accomplish the convenient 
validation processes. These coin selectors have to be conveniently 
programmed so as to generate the convenient signs for 
each type of coin. Sometimes programming must be executed 
on selectors that are already working, right at the 
moment of the incorporation of new type of coins, or the 
substitution of other coins, etc... Up to the date, programming control and other 
operations performed by the selector, are being 
accomplished thanks to a control device that 
incorporates a LED type display and a series of 
accesories, among them the unavoidable keyboard which is  
 
used to introduce the commands. The common point is that 
this control group forms a device foreign to the so 
called selector that is situated in its own grid linked 
to the selector through the necessary buses or connecting 
wires and through the appropiate connectors. The coin 
selector and the control device will be situated in 
different and appropiate places of the machine's core. It is known from GB-A-2 128 006 to incorporate, in a 
vending machine, controls including an alpha-numeric display, 
a mode switch, a setting switch and data stepping switches, 
in order to set up various parameters of the vending 
machine, e.g. prices, failure codes, etc.. The coin selector proposed by the invention as defined in the claim solves 
this problem in a highly satisfactory way. Starting at 
the classic structuring proper to any conventional and 
appropiate coin selector, it focusses its features on the 
fact that it integrates the control unit in the core of 
its own grid. The grid is also provided in one of its 
sides, preferably in one of its bigger sides, with four 
windows, one of which bears the alphanumeric display. An 
acceptance switch is situated in another window, and a 
couple of switches for forward/backward sliding. According to this structuring, control is 
accomplished through a menu

<CLAIMS>
An improved coin selector, of the type used to detect the legal validity of the different types of coins in automatic 
or semiautomatic machines able to provide a product, 

goods or a service in exchange for the introduction of coins 
or tokens with a defined value, the selector 

comprising a range of validation tools for several kinds 
of coins and having in the core of its own grid (1) 

a selector control unit, 
the grid having four windows (2, 4, 5, 5') 

in one of its sides, one 
(2) where an alphanumeric display (3) is situated, 

another (4) where an acceptance switch (6) is placed, and 
the other two (5, 5') where a forward switch (7) and a backward 

switch (7') are situated, wherein, in use, the forward and backward switches give access to 
the options of menus, the acceptance switch 

(6) selects an option, and later gives access to several sub-menus, whereby the coin selector may be programmed 
so as to generate the convenient signs for each 

type of coin.
