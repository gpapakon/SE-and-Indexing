<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device at a trailer (1), especially a boat trailer (10), which includes a chassis (1a) supported by wheels (1b) and a coupling device (1f) in the front for connecting the trailer (1) to a towing vehicle. A two-armed lever consists of arms (2a, 2b) which form an angle with each other and is pivoted in an axis of rotation (3) which is oriented transversally at the back of the trailer. The first arm of the lever (2a), which mainly points forward from the axis of rotation (3) has a length that exceeds or falls below the length of the other arm (2b) of the lever. The two lever-arms comprise parallel arm elements (2a1, 2b1; 2a2, 2b2), whose ends are connected to the ends of the axis of rotation and which at their outer ends are linked by transversal beams (2a3, 2b3). A winch tower (6) with a winch (1d) is provided at the front end of the trailer. The wire (1e) of the winch is adapted to run over the outer ends of the lever-arms (2a, 2b) and in its end is provided with lifting means for the object.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device at a trailer
including a chassis supported by wheels, a coupling device
in the front for connecting the trailer to a towing
vehicle and also provided at the front end of the trailer,
a winch tower with a winch to facilitate movement of an
object along the trailer. In particular the invention
relates to a lifting device at a boat trailer. Such a trailer
is known e.g. from WO 88/04618.When loading and unloading a trailer, it is in most cases
necessary to move heavy objects vertically as well as
horizontally to and from the trailer. If the object is
heavy, access to a lifting device or assistance from other
persons are usually required to perform the vertical
movement. This leads to essential limitations with respect
to the usefulness of trailer.At launching and loading of pleasure-boats it is common
practice to make use of a special boat trailer and a
slanting ramp by means of which the trailer can be driven
down into and out of the water. As a result of this
procedure the most sensitive details on the boat trailer
are lowered into water, which might cause corrosion
damages. Furthermore, it is usually necessary to be at
least two persons when launching and loading with a boat
trailer and a ramp; one person to handle the towing
vehicle and the boat trailer and one person in the boat.The aim of the present invention is to provide a device at
a trailer which eliminates said inconveniences and enables
loading of a trailer by one person, especially launching 
and loading of a pleasure-boat from a quay, a pier or the
like. In accordance with the invention this aim is
obtained in that the device comprises a two-armed lever,
whose arms form an angle with each other and comprise
parallel arm, which are pivoted in an axis of rotation,
which is oriented transversally at the back of the
trailer, the first parallel arm elements, which mainly
points forward from the axis of rotation, has lengths that
exceeds or falls below the lengths of the second parallel
arm elements of the lever, the ends of the parallel arm
elements are connected to the ends of the axis of rotation
and at their outer ends they are linked by transversal
beams, the distance between the outer ends of the first
parallel arm elements, exceeds or falls below the distance
between the outer ends of the second parallel arm elements
and limits the width of objects that can be loaded on to
or unloaded from the trailer, the angle between the arms
of the two-armed lever is determined by a rod, which is
detachably

<CLAIMS>
Device at a trailer (1, 7) including a chassiss (1a,
7a) supported by wheels (1b, 7b), a coupling device

device comprises a two-armed lever, whose arms form

an angle with each other and comprise parallel arm
elements (2a1, 2b1; 2a2, 2b2: 10a1, 10
b1; 10a2,
10b2), which are pivoted in an axis of rotation (3,

11), which is oriented transversally at the back of
the trailer, the first parallel arm elements (2a1,

2a2: 10a1, 10a2), which mainly points forward from
the axis of rotation (3, 11), has lengths that

exceeds or falls below the lengths of the second
parallel arm elements(2b1, 2b2: 10b1, 10b2) of the

lever, the ends of the parallel arm elements (2a1,
2b1; 2a2, 2b2) are connected to the ends of the axis

of rotation (3, 11) and at their outer ends they are
linked by transversal beams (2a3, 2b3: 10a3, 10b3),

the distance between the outer ends of the first
