<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
method of forming a
hydraulic damper for a motor vehicle. By hydraulic damper is meant a
suspension strut or shock absorber.A hydraulic damper for use in the suspension
system of a motor vehicle typically comprises a tube;
a piston sealably slidably mounted in the tube and
attached to a piston rod, the piston separating a
compression chamber from a rebound chamber within the
tube; a compression stroke valve mounted on the piston
which allows fluid flow from the compression chamber
to the rebound chamber; and a rebound stroke valve
mounted on the piston which allows fluid flow from the
rebound chamber to the compression chamber. The
piston rod extends out of the tube at one end thereof,
and is sealably slidably mounted in that one end.
Such hydraulic dampers either comprise an inner tube
and an outer tube (sometimes referred to as a twin
tube damper) in which the piston sealably slides in
the inner tube, or comprise a single tube (sometimes
referred to as a monotube damper).It is usual practice to form the or each
tube of a hydraulic damper by rolling a sheet of steel
and welding together the adjacent longitudinal edges.
External parts, such as the spring seat and the
mounting bracket or steering knuckle, which are also
formed from steel, are then welded to the single tube
or the outer tube. The other end of the tube is
sealed closed by welding on an end plate or by
arc-heating and rolling the tube end, and the internal
components of the suspension strut (such as those
mentioned above) are inserted into the tube by way of
the one end thereof, which is then sealed closed. The
use of several welding steps has disadvantages in that
welds are time consuming operations. Further, welds 
are susceptible to corrosion. Still further, the use
of steel has disadvantages with regard to weight.DE-A-4102002 discloses a method in
accordance with the preamble of claim 1.It is an object of the present invention to
overcome one or more of the above mentioned
disadvantages.To this end, a method of forming a hydraulic
damper in accordance with the present invention
comprises extruding a tube of aluminium or aluminium
alloy; and closing an end of the extruded tube by
flame heating the end of the extruded tube and rolling
the flame heated end.This invention removes the steps of welding,
thereby removing time consuming operations. Further
the use of aluminium or aluminium alloy has advantages
with regard to weight when compared to previously
known arrangements.The present invention will now be

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a hydraulic damper
(10) comprising extruding a tube (12) of aluminium or

aluminium alloy; and closing an end (28) of the
extruded tube; characterised in that the end is closed

by flame heating the end of the extruded tube and
rolling the flame heated end.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, in which
the damper (10) has an inner tube (14) coaxial with an

outer tube (12), wherein the outer tube is the
extruded tube.
A method as claimed in Claim 2, wherein
the inner tube (14) is also extruded from aluminium or

aluminium alloy.
A method as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim
3, wherein the outer tube (12") is extruded with a

number of inwardly directed webs (62) integrally
formed with the outer tube on extrusion thereof, the

webs providing support for the inner tube.
A method as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim
3, wherein the inner (14) and outer (12) tube are

integrally extruded in one piece along with a number
of interconnecting webs (68).
A method as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 5, wherein the extruded tube (70) is extruded

with substantially identical T-shaped channels (74)
formed in its external surface (72), the channels

extending along the length of the tube.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 6, wherein a mounting bracket (46) is integrally

formed with the extruded tube on extrusion thereof.
A method as claimed in Claim 7, wherein
two substantially parallel arms (42) are extruded with 

the extruded tube (12') and the arms are then cut to
form the mounting bracket.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 8, wherein, after insertion of required

components inside the extruded tube, the other end
(30) of the tube (12,12') is spun closed to retain the

components within the extruded tube.
