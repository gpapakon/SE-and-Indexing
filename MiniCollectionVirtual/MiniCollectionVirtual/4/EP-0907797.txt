<ABSTRACT>
An uncreped tissue sheet having improved softness results from supplementally dewatering a wet web to a consistency of greater than about 30 percent using noncompressive dewatering techniques (30) prior to a differential speed transfer (37) and subsequent throughdrying (44). An air press (30) particularly well suited for providing the supplemental noncompressive dewatering incorporates side (80) and/or end seals (78) to minimize escape of pressurized fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
There are many characteristics of tissue products such as bath and facial tissue
that must be considered in producing a final product having desirable attributes that
make it suitable and preferred for the product's intended purpose, improved softness of
the product has long been one major objective, and this has been a particularly
significant factor for the success of premium products. In general, the major components
of softness include stiffness and bulk (density), with lower stiffness and higher bulk (lower
density) generally improving perceived softness.While enhanced softness is a desire for all types of tissue products, it has been
especially challenging to achieve softness improvements in uncreped throughdried
sheets. Throughdrying provides a relatively noncompressive method of removing water
from a web by passing hot air through the web until it is dry. More specifically, a wet-laid
web is transferred from the forming fabric to a coarse, highly permeable throughdrying
fabric and retained on the throughdrying fabric until dry. The resulting dried web is softer
and bulkier than a conventionally-dried uncreped sheet because fewer bonds are formed
and because the web is less compressed. Thus, there are benefits to eliminating the
Yankee dryer and making an uncreped throughdried product Uncreped throughdried
sheets are typically quite harsh and rough to the touch, however, compared to their
creped counterparts. This is partially due to the inherently high stiffness and strength of
an uncreped sheet, but is also due in part to the coarseness of the throughdrying fabric
onto which the wet web is conformed and dried.Therefore, what are lacking and needed in the art are a method and apparatus for
manufacturing tissue products having improved softness, and in particular uncreped
throughdried tissue products having improved softness.WO 95/00706 A relates to a method of making a soft tissue
sheet comprising forming an aqueous suspension of papermaking
fibers, mechanically working the suspension, diluting the
aqueous suspension of curled fibers to a consistency of about
0,5 percent or less, depositing the diluted aqueous suspension
onto a forming fabric to form a wet web, dewatering the wet
web to a consistency of from about 20 to about 30 percent,
transferring the dewatered web from the forming fabric to a
throughdrying fabric, and throughdrying the web to final
dryness.US-A-5,048,589 discloses hand or wiper towels produced by a
