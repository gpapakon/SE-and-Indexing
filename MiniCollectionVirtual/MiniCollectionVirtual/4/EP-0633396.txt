<ABSTRACT>
A metal gasket assembly comprises a substrate 
metal sheet (1) having at least one opening (3), and a 

peripheral member (5) fitted into the opening along the 
periphery thereof. The peripheral member (5) is made of a 

metal plate having a thickness larger than that of the 
substrate metal sheet (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal gasket
assembly comprised primarily of metal components such as
stainless steel plates.A conventional metal gasket assembly generally
comprises one or more metal plates having openings and
beads formed around the openings. Such a metal gasket
assembly is typically used in an internal combustion
engine as a seal between a cylinder block and a cylinder
head.To improve the sealing effect of a metal gasket
assembly, there has been proposed to attach a shim to a
substrate metal sheet at a region surrounding a cylinder
opening so that the fastening pressure applied to the
metal gasket assembly is locally increased in that
region.However, the conventional metal gasket assembly
interposed between the cylinder block and the cylinder
head requires a strong fastening by bolts for effective
sealing, and thus it may cause a deformation in the 
cylinder head. Particularly, in a portion around a
combustion chamber, the deformation in the cylinder head
tends to increase the size of a gap formed between the
cylinder block and the cylinder head. This gap allows
an escape of combustion gases from the chamber, which
leads to a contamination of the metal gasket assembly
and hence, to a gradual deterioration of the seal
between the cylinder block and the cylinder head.Moreover, since the size of the gap around the
combustion chamber changes corresponding to the change
of combustion pressure in the internal combustion
engine, beads provided on the metal gasket assembly are
subjected to an alternating load of compression and
restoration, thereby giving rise to fatigue of the beads
on the metal gasket assembly. The fatigued beads with
reduced elasticity weaken the fastening function of
bolts, with the result that the sealing effect of the
metal gasket assembly is decreased.Furthermore, in the case of a metal gasket
assembly employing a shim ring, the thickness of the
shim ring is significantly influential on the sealing
performance of the metal gasket assembly. However, it
is difficult to adjust the shim thickness to 0.05 mm or
less, because of difficulties in producing, with a
sufficient accuracy, a plate of such thickness for use as a
shim. Patent abstracts of Japan V13, No 282 (M-843)
relating to JP-A-1-77740 describes a metallic gasket
comprising two base plates which sandwich an intermediate
plate.EP-0,616,154 A discloses a gasket assembly in which a
peripheral member is fitted in an opening of a substrate
and two by-plates are provided.It is therefore a primary object of the
