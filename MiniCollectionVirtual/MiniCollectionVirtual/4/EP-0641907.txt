<ABSTRACT>
A motor vehicle with a body open at the top has two pivotable hoods arranged at a distance from one another, each hood being provided with a lock which is connected via a connecting element to an actuating handle of an operating device, and the two hoods being unlockable from the passenger space. In order to develop a device for locking and unlocking two hoods of an open passenger car which are located at a distance from one another, in such a way that, whilst having a simplified design, it can be produced cost-effectively and constitutes an effective anti-theft device, provision is made for assigning the two actuating handles to a common operating device which comprises a bearing housing having a central cylinder lock. Formed-on catches of the two actuating handles cooperate with outer walls of the lock case of the cylinder lock.

<CLAIMS>
A device for locking and unlocking at least two pivotable covers (7, 9) of a motor vehicle 
(1) arranged at a distance from each other, in particular of a passenger car with bodywork 

open at the top, wherein each cover (7, 9) comprises a lock (13, 14) connected to an 
actuating switch (19, 20) of an operating device (17) by way of a connecting member 

(15, 16), and the two covers (7, 9) can be unlocked from the passenger compartment, 

characterized in that
 the two actuating switches (19, 20) are associated with a common 
operating device (17) comprising a support housing (18) with a central cylinder lock 

(21), wherein integrally moulded catches (36, 37) of the two actuating switches (19, 20) 
are operatively connected to the outer walls (34, 35) of the housing (22) of the cylinder 

lock (21). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 in a locking position (
A
) of a 
closing cylinder (23) mounted in the lock housing (22) the catches (36, 37) of the two 

actuating switches (19, 20) rest with positive locking against the outsides of the outer 
walls (34, 35) of the housing (22) and thus fix the actuating switches (19, 20) in the rest 

position thereof. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 in an unlocking position (
B
) of the 
closing cylinder (23) arranged in the lock housing (22) the said lock housing (22) is 

pressed outwards by a compression spring (40), as a result of which the catches (36, 37) 
of the two actuating switches (19, 20) cooperate with recesses (41, 42) of the lock 

housing (22), in such a way that in this position the actuating switch or switches (19, 20) 
is or are pivoted and so at least one of the two covers (7, 9) is unlocked. 
A device according to Claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that
 the closing cylinder (23) is 
actuable by means of a key, wherein the key used is preferably the ignition key which 

can also be used for all the other closing devices of the vehicle. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the actuating switches (19, 20) are 
arranged on opposite sides of an upper, prism-shaped area (32) of the lock housing (22). 
A device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the closing cylinder (23) is provided 
at the lower end thereof with an eccentric (27) which cooperates with a springloaded 

displaceable locking member (29), wherein the locking member (29) is mounted  
 

displaceably in a recess (30) in the lock housing (22). 
A device according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the locking member (29) engages 
behind a base portion (38) of the bearing housing (18) when the closing cylinder (23) is 

locked. 
A device according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 a roller (39) is secured to the 
locking member (29), the roller (39) limiting the lifting movement of the lock housing 

(22) by being supported against the underside of the base portion (38) when the lock 
housing (22) is moved upwards by the compression spring (40). 
A device according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 each 
projecting catch (36, 37) is formed by wall portions (61, 62) abutting at a right angle to 

each other and adjoining flat switch portions (47, 48) and cross-sectional enlargements 
(53, 54) of the actuating switches (19, 20) by way of stepped or rounded transition areas. 
A device according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 each recess (41, 42) is formed by 
a first, obliquely extending lower portion (63) and a second, arcuate upper portion (64), 

wherein the wall portion (61) of the pivoted actuating switch (19, 20) rests against the 
first portion (63), whereas the arcuate portion (64) extends towards the second wall 

portion (62) of the catches (36, 37) while forming a gap.
