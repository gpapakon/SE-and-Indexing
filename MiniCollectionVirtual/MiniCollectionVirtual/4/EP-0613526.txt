<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to float-operated over-center valve 
actuating mechanisms for liquid pumping systems where a 
pressure vessel is alternately filled with a liquid and emptied 
with pump operation controlled by the level of liquid such as a 
condensate accumulating within the pressure vessel, and more 
particularly to a float-operated over-center valve actuating 
mechanism which subjects oppositely acting chamber vent and 
operating gas pressure inlet valves to a high compressive preload 
force which increases as the mechanism toggle linkage moves 
alternately across an over-center position. Such over-center float-operated valve actuating 
mechanisms are useful in controlling the filling of a closed or 
sealed pressure vessel and in which the vessel includes a vent 
valve for venting the interior of the vessel to the atmosphere and 
a second pressure valve subjected to high pressure inlet fluid, 
such as live steam at 6,89 · 105 to 34,47 Pa (100 to 500 psi), to drive an accumulated  
 
liquid periodically from said vessel. In filling such vessel, the 
vent valve is in the open position and the pressure valve is 
closed by the single-float operated over-center valve actuating 
mechanism. As the vessel fills with liquid, the float rises and a 
rotatable float arm, forming part of the valve actuating 
mechanism, is swung or rotated about a pivot point at one end 
thereof remote from the float, causing an over-center toggle 
linkage mechanism to move toward the center position against 
a spring bias. Such a mechanism has toggle linkage elements 
which snap quickly through the center position, closing the vent 
valve simultaneously with snap opening of the high pressure 
inlet valve to pump the accumulated liquid from the vessel. Typically, a tension coil spring provides such biasing force 
with one end of the coil spring coupled to a fixed or stationary 
member of the valve mechanism or vessel. In other cases, such 
tension coil spring is coupled at opposite ends to moveable 
elements of the valve actuating mechanism. U.S. patents representative of the state of the art with 
respect to snap-acting, over-center valve actuating mechanisms 
particularly useful in periodically filling a vessel with liquid while 
venting the same and closure of the vent valve upon filling of  
 
the liquid to a degree effecting actuation of the over-center valve 
actuating mechanism and to permit fluid pressure pumping by 
positive pressure or vacuum pressure of the accumulated liquid 
from the vessel are the following:
