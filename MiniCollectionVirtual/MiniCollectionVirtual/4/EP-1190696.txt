<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hair cosmetic compositions, which have a fragrance
with an unpleasant smell masked although such an unpleasant smell would otherwise be
given off from ammonia, monoethanolamine, or a penetration promoter of the aromatic
alcohol type.In hair dye or coloring formulations (hereinafter collectively called "hair coloring
formulations"), alkaline agents such as ammonia and monoethanolamine are frequently
incorporated therein. The ammonia and amine smells, which these compositions inherently
have, have remained unsolved as a serious problem for both those applying the hair coloring
formulations and those treated with the formulations. Thus, there has been a long-standing
desire for the development of a method for masking ammonia and amine odors inherent to
these formulations. In many hair cosmetic compositions with such hair coloring
formulations incorporated therein, on the other hand, a penetration promoter of the aromatic
alcohol type is added to promote the penetration of ingredients which act on hair. However,
this penetration promoter also imparts a solvent smell to the compositions. These factors
have led to a significant need for the development of a method by which the odor of such
compositions can be masked. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a hair coloring
formulation which effectively masks the odor(s) inherent to solvent, ammonia and amine
containing hair coloring formulations.Briefly, this object and other objects of the present invention as hereinafter will
become more readily apparent can be attained by a hair cosmetic formulation, which
comprises: (A) a fragrance ingredient comprising cis-3-hexenol, and (B) at least one
ingredient selected from the group consisting of ammonia, monoethanolamine, and an
aromatic alcohol penetration promoter.With a view to ascertaining how to mask the unpleasant smells of hair cosmetic
compositions containing ammonia, monoethanolamine and aromatic alcohols, an
investigation has been conducted into the effectiveness of a variety of fragrant materials in
masking undesirable odors. As a result, it has been found that addition of cis-3-hexenol,
which is called "leaf alcohol" and which has not been considered to be readily useful in
formulations as a fragrance because of its grassy smell hair, in an amount greater than its
usual amount results in a hair cosmetic composition which has a very desirable fragrance.The hair cosmetic composition of the present invention has a desirable fragrance in
which the odor
