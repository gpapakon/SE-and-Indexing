<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns flowmeters and, more particularly, such meters for measuring peak expiratory flow or PEF. The PEF meter is provided with means normally effective to inhibit respiratory flow through the meter, such means being operable in response to attainment of a predetermined pressure to allow the flow. A valve (5) is used, held closed by an electromagnetic latch (6) or mechanical/magnetic latch, opening at the set pressure. A flow transducer (2), such as a hot wire anemometer, measures the flow, which is displayed and/or stored by means (8). From the PEF measured the airway passage resistance can be determined. Further lung characteristics can be determined from the shape of the decay portion (10) of the expiratory flow curve. The meter has clinical application in the monitoring and diagnosis of asthma and other pulmanory diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns flowmeters and, more particularly, 
such meters for measuring peak expiratory flow, commonly denoted 
as PEF. PEF meters are now seen to be of clinical value in the 
diagnosis and management of asthma and they are widely prescribed 
for this purpose in a portable form suited to domiciliary usage. 
This last form typically involves a piston-and-cylinder assembly 
through which the piston is movable against a spring bias by the 
action of a forced expiration, with the piston position affording 
a measure of the expiratory flow. A well known meter of this 
form is described in UK Patent Specification No. 1,463,814 In any event, notwithstanding the value and usage of PEF 
meters, work leading to development of the present invention 
indicates that they have shortcomings and are open to 
improvement. More specifically their operation is effort-dependent. 
As a consequence of this, successive measures taken 
over a period of time by the same subject are not necessarily 
usefully comparable, and comparability between measures taken 
from different patients is probably less reliable. An object of the present invention is to improve this 
situation and, to this end, it is proposed that a PEF meter be 
provided with means normally effective to inhibit expiratory flow 
through the meter, such means being operable in response to 
attainment of a predetermined expiratory pressure to allow the 
expiratory flow. In a preferred form the flow inhibiting means of the 
invention comprises a valve mechanism which normally closes the 
expiratory flow path through the meter, the mechanism being 
operable to open the path. The flow inhibiting means is preferably of a fast acting form 
when operated, in the sense that its operation takes a short time 
relative to the duration of a forced expiration and does not take 
significantly longer than attainment of peak flow during such 
expiration.  
 Preferably the flow inhibiting means is adapted to operate in 
a time significantly shorter than that taken for attainment of 
peak flow during forced expiration. For these last purposes, the flow inhibiting means suitably 
comprises a shutter or flap valve mechanism operable to open in 
response to an electrical signal from a pressure detector. Such 
a mechanism will provide a fast-acting flow inhibiting means of 
minimal resistance when open. In an alternative arrangement, the flow inhibiting means 
comprises a mechanism of a mechanical or magnetic form operable 
to open in direct response to the relevant

<CLAIMS>
A peak expiratory flow meter wherein means are provided 
normally effective to inhibit expiratory flow through the meter, 

such means being operable in response to attainment of a 
predetermined expiratory pressure to allow the expiratory flow. 
A meter according to Claim 1, wherein the flow inhibiting 
means comprises a valve mechanism which normally closes the 

expiratory flow path through the meter, the mechanism being 
operable to open the path. 
A meter according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the flow 
inhibiting means is of a fast acting form when operated, in the 

sense that its operation takes a short time relative to the 
duration of a forced expiration and does not take significantly 

longer than attainment of peak flow during such expiration. 
A meter according to Claim 3, wherein the flow inhibiting 
means is adapted to operate in a time significantly shorter than 

that taken for attainment of peak flow during forced expiration. 
A meter according to Claim 3 or Claim 4, wherein the flow 
inhibiting means comprises a shutter or flap valve mechanism 

operable to open in response to an electrical signal from a 
pressure detector.

provided to decide the value of the predetermined pressure in 

response to the electrical signal. 
A meter according to Claim 8, wherein a release pressure 
value for the flow inhibiting means is preset, and the computing 

means is programmed to open the flow inhibiting means at a 
pressure level lower than this release pressure value if such a 

pressure level is maintained for a predetermined length of time.
