<ABSTRACT>
A surface rewinder and method wherein a three drum 
cradle includes spaced apart first and second winding drums (11,17) and 

wherein the speed profile (21) of the second winding drum (17) is 
controlled to substantially eliminate slippage between the 

second winding drum (17) and a web (W) being wound on a core (C) by 
increasing the speed (21,23) of the second drum (17) after passage 

of the core (C) between two drums (11,17) into 
the space as a function of the increasing diameter of the roll (L) 

being wound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface rewinder and method
and, more particularly to a rewinder wherein the operation of
one of the winding rolls features a unique speed profile.In the past, two basic types of surface rewinders have
been available commercially. One type of surface rewinder is
seen in co-owned Patent US-A-4,909,452 and features a movable winding
drum. More particularly, the transition of the core and
partially wound product from one side of the nip of the winding
drums to the other is done with a combination of lower drum
movement, infeed transfer finger exposure and speed differential 
between the two drums. At the beginning of the cycle the
distance between the two winding drums is very quickly
dropped. The infeed transfer fingers are then
proportionately exposed and this, along with a small
speed differential between the drums, drives the product
from one side of the drums' nip to the other. This allows
the diameter of the product to build and move through the
transition from one side to the other without additional
compression.In document EP-A-0 402 325, on which the pre-characterizing
part of claims 1 and 5 is based, a
rewinder uses a short slowing down of one winding drum to
facilitate the introduction of a new core and the
ejection of a formed roll.Another surface rewinder can be seen in Patent US-A-4,327,877.
This uses a speed change of one of the rolls
to quickly move the core and product partly wound thereon
from one side of the pair of winding rolls to the other.
This method compresses the product while the speed change
advances the product. In operation, the lower drum speed
quickly slows by controlled deceleration and then returns
to and maintains a constant speed differential through
the remainder of the wind cycle.In each case, there is a degree of dependency on
slippage between the product and the surfaces in contact
therewith. If the drum surfaces are smooth enough to
allow slippage, they also permit unstable products
(typically soft rolls) which easily bounce around in the
three drum winding area limiting the speed at which they
can be run.According to the invention, the three drum cradle
includes spaced apart first and second winding drums with
control means operably associated with the drums for
changing 
the rotational speed of one drum to substantially eliminate
slippage and also provide a speed profile in this drum wherein
the speed of the drum is decreased in the beginning of each
winding cycle to advance a partially wound roll through the
space between winding drums

<CLAIMS>
A surface rewinder for convolutely
wound web rolls comprising a frame (F), a three drum

cradle rotatably mounted on said frame and including
spaced apart first and second winding drums (11, 17)

and a rider drum (R), means on said frame (F) for
rotating each of said drums (11, 17), core

introducing means (15) on said frame (F) for moving a
core (C) toward the space (22) between said first and

second winding drum, control means operably
associated with said frame for changing the

rotational speed of said second winding drum (17)
such that the speed of the second drum is decreased

just prior to the beginning of each winding cycle
characterized in that the control means is also

capable of substantially eliminating slippage between
said second winding drum (17) and a web roll being

wound on said core (C) by providing a speed profile
in said second winding drum (17) wherein the speed of

said second drum is decreased just prior to the
beginning of each winding cycle (25) to

advance a partially wound roll through said space
(22) and thereafter increased as a function of the

increasing diameter of said partially wound roll (L).
The rewinder of claim 1 in which said
frame (F) is equipped with means for moving said

second winding drum (17) during each cycle of
winding. 
The rewinder of claim 2 in which said
means moves said second winding drum through a closed

path (19).
The rewinder of claim 1 in which said
second winding roll (17) has a cylindrical outer

surface, said surface being equipped with non-slip
material.
A method for convolutely winding web
rolls comprising providing a three drum cradle

rotatably mounted on a frame (F) and including spaced
apart first and second winding drums (11, 17) and a

rider drum (R), rotating each of said drums, moving a
core (C) toward the space (22) between said first and

second winding drums (11, 17), and controlling the
rotational speed of said second winding drum (17)

such that the speed is decreased just prior to the
beginning of each winding cycle characterized in that

the speed of the second winding drum (17) is
controlled to substantially eliminate slippage

between said second winding drum (17) and a web roll
(L) being wound on said core (C) by providing a speed

profile in said second winding drum (17)
wherein the speed of said second drum is decreased

(25 - Fig 2) just prior to the beginning of each
winding cycle to advance a partially wound roll

through said space (22) and thereafter increased as a
function of the increasing diameter of said partially

wound roll (L).
The method of claim 5 in which said
second winding drum (17) is moved during each winding

cycle to change the space between said first and
second winding drums (11, 17).
