<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of processing used batteries, especially zinc-carbon and alkali-manganese batteries, in order to recover any usable or environmentally relevant substances, comprising the mechanical reduction of the initial material followed by the separation of the battery granulate thus obtained into a fine and a coarser fraction. The coarser fraction is further separated into a magnetic and a non-magnetic part, followed by principally wet chemical steps to sort out the fractions containing the individual useful or environmentally relevant substances and their separation.

Method of processing used batteries, particularly 
zinc-carbon and alkali-manganese batteries, in order to 

recover usable or environmentally relevant substances 

contained therein, which method includes mechanical reduction 
of the application material, a separation of the thus-obtained 

battery granulate into a fine fraction and into a 
coarser fraction, wherein the coarser fraction is further 

separated into a magnetic part and a non-magnetic part, the 
method further comprising subsequent, predominantly wetchemical 

steps to separate the fractions that contain the 
individual usable or environmentally relevant substances, as 

well as their separation, characterized in that the zinc 
present in dissolved form after separation of ammonium 

chloride and, possibly, water-insoluble materials having a 
lower density than water by means of separate suspension of 

the fine fraction and the non-magnetic part in water, setting 
of the pH value of the thus-obtained suspension above 12, 

removal of the released ammonium and filtration of the 
suspension for obtaining said water-insoluble materials is 

separated out by means of precipitation after setting of the 
pH value to 11 and filtering off of the obtained, zinc-containing 

precipitate. 
Method as defined in claim 1, wherein the separation 
of active carbon after acidification of the residue obtained 

during filtration of the suspensions is effected by means of 
filtration at a pH value of 1.  

 
Method as defined in claim 2, wherein the 
separation of the manganese present in dissolved form in the 

filtrate obtained after separation of the active carbon is 
effected by means of electrolysis, or manganometrically. 
Method as defined in claim 3, wherein the 
separation of other compounds present, for example mercury 

compounds, is effected by means of alkaline setting of the 
filtrate obtained after separation of the manganese, and 

subsequent sulfide precipitation. 
Method as defined in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the 
materials separated off according to one of the foregoing claims 

are further treated in a suitable manner so that they can be 
supplied to further processing and/or a dump. 
Method as defined in any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the 
individual steps of the method are performed below or at ambient 

temperature, or at the temperature caused by the respective 
reaction, without additional heating.
