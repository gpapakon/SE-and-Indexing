<ABSTRACT>
In a computed tomography X-ray system, the number of A/D converters required to digitize detector output signals is reduced without degrading the resultant tomographic image. This hardware reduction results from combining certain detector output signals into a pseudo detector having a single output. The detector output signals thus combined represent data corresponding to X-ray beams having substantially the same Radon radius. Preferable such X-ray beams also traverse substantially the same region of the CT system's reconstruction circle. Where the pseudo detector includes the output signals read from N sequentially scanned detectors Di, where i=1 denotes the first read detector and i=N the last read detector, the output of each detector Di is delayed a time (N-i)(tau), and the thus delayed outputs are summed together to provide the pseudo detector output. In the above relationship, (tau) is the interval between reading adjacent detectors Di and Di+1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to radiation
imaging systems, and more particularly to
apparatus for reducing the complexity of the analog-to-digital
processors and the number of downstream channels
required to process x-ray detector output signals in such
systems.Early in this century, the Austrian mathematician J.
Radon demonstrated that a two-dimensional slice of a three-dimensional
object may be reproduced from an infinite set
of all of its projections. Computed tomography ("CT")
X-ray systems generate an infinite set of X-ray beam
projections through an object to be examined. The
resultant detected X-ray data are computer processed to
reconstruct a tomographic image-slice of the object.More specifically, CT systems subject the object under
examination to one or more pencil-like X-ray beams from all
possible directions. X-ray beams passing through the
object are attenuated by various amounts, depending upon
the nature of the object traversed (e.g., bone, tissue,
metal). One or more X-ray detectors, disposed on the far
side of the object, receive these beams and provide analog
output signals proportional to the strength of the incoming
X-rays. Each detector output is then digitized and
computer processed to help produce an image of a slice of
the object. For an ideally reconstructed image, a CT system would
have an infinitely large number of extremely tiny closely-spaced
detectors (or fewer detectors repositionable to an
infinite number of very closely spaced locations). Because
of limitations imposed by economics and hardware, practical
CT systems process X-ray beam data from hundreds or
thousands of detectors (or detector positions). However,
the cost of analog-to-digital ("A/D") conversion of the
output of hundreds or thousands of detectors can be
prohibitive. The present invention discloses an apparatus
and method for reducing the complexity of A/D converters
required by CT systems, as well as the number of digitized
information channels to be computer processed, without
substantial degradation of the image produced.At this juncture it is helpful to briefly overview the
various types of CT X-ray scanner systems that have been
developed, to appreciate better the problems associated
with obtaining sufficient data to provide a meaningful
output image.A "first generation" CT scanner configuration is
schematically depicted in Figure 1A, and includes a single
X-ray source (S), and a single detector (D), both of which
move in a translate-rotate fashion (indicated by arrows T,
R) relative to the
