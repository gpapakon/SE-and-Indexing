<ABSTRACT>
A method for the identification of agents that inhibit 
melanin biosynthesis involves the incubation of test samples 

in cultures of a fungus that produces melanin. Observation 
of altered pigmentation in the culture or culture area containing 

test sample indicates inhibition of melanin biosynthesis. 
Preferred cultures for the screen contain a fungus 

that pigments in the light or the dark such as 
Cladosporium 
cucumerinum
. Preferred embodiments employ test samples on 
disks or in wells in solidified cultures and a known melanin 

synthesis inhibitor as a positive control which is compared 
to the test sample by simple visual inspection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fungal screen for inhibitors
of melanin biosynthesis, particularly for fungicides
that inhibit the biosynthesis of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene
melanin.Found in animals, plants, and microorganisms, melanins
are biological pigments responsible for the dark color of
skin, hair, feathers, fur, and insect cuticle. A number of
these diverse macromolecules have been identified and shown
to have a polymeric nucleus containing quinone, hydroquinone,
and/or semiquinone moieties (reviewed by Bell, A.A.,
and Wheeler, M.H., Ann. Rev. Phytopathol. 24: 411-51
(1986)). Black pigments in animals, for example, are formed
from DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) melanin, biosynthesized
in a pathway involving the oxidation of tyrosine by
tyrosinase. Red pigments in animals are formed by the polymerization
of cysteinyl DOPA, which is the product of cysteine
reacted with DOPA quinone, and yellow and brown pigments
in animals are mixed polymers formed from both DOPA
and cysteinyl DOPA. Animal melanins are synthesized and
maintained almost totally as melanosomes and granules within
the cytoplasm of specialized cells.In contrast to animal melanins, fungal melanins generally
exhibit a different pattern of polymer deposition, 
occurring either in cell walls or as extracellular polymers-formed
in the medium around fungal cells. Extracellular
melanins formed by fungi from tyrosine or tyrosine-containing
protein hydrolysates are undoubtedly similar to the
DOPA melanins; tyrosinases from mushrooms and Neurospora
crassa have been thoroughly characterized, and tyrosinase
has also been confirmed in other fungi, bacteria, and Actinomycetes
(ibid.). Melanins in cell walls of Basidiomycotina,
on the other hand, are derived from glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene
(GDHB) or catechol as the immediate
phenolic precursor of the melanin polymer. In the Ascomycotina
and related Deuteromycotina, the dark-brown to black
melanins in cell walls are generally synthesized from the
pentaketide pathway in which 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)
is the immediate precursor of the polymer.Melanins have the unique capability of absorbing light
over a broad range of wavelengths (âˆ¼200 to 2400 nm). In
man, the pigment serves as an excellent screen against the
untoward effects of solar ultraviolet radiation. In fungi,
melanins may be essential for protection of the organism
against ultraviolet irradiation as well as radio waves, desiccation,
and temperature extremes (Bell and Wheeler, cited
above, page 430). The most important role of fungal

A method for screening for the presence or absence of melanin synthesis
inhibition by a test sample which comprises:


(a) preparing a solidified culture of a fungus that produces melanin;
(b) adding said test sample to the culture;
(c) incubating said test sample in the culture and a first corresponding
culture containing no test sample and a second corresponding culture

containing a known melanin synthesis inhibitor as a control for such
time under such conditions sufficient to observe cell growth and

pigmentation in the first corresponding culture containing no test
sample; and
(d) determining the presence of melanin synthesis inhibition by visual
observation that pigmentation in the solidified culture with the test

sample is altered in comparison to pigmentation in the first
corresponding culture containing no test sample.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the culture containing test sample, the
culture containing no test sample, and the culture containing a known melanin

synthesis inhibitor comprise different portions of a single solidified fungal culture.

selected from the group consisting of pyroquilon and tricyclazole.
A method according to claim 2 wherein the fungus that produces melanin is
