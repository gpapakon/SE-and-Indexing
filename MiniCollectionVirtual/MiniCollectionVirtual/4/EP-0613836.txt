<ABSTRACT>
Pressurised-foam dispenser containing a foaming liquid pressurised by a non-liquefiable compressed gas, equipped with a dispensing valve (7) having an additional gas connector (tap, take-off) (8) such that the gas/liquid ratio of the mixture dispensed is between 95/5 and 99/1 (vol/vol), the said dispenser being equipped with a push button (30) including a spraying member and an end piece, the said end piece comprising a casing (34) defining an accumulation chamber (40) in which the spraying member sprays the product to be dispensed through a spraying nozzle (39) emerging in the said accumulation chamber (40), the said nozzle (39) having a diameter between 0.7 and 2 mm in diameter, the said chamber (40) being closed by a porous sinter (36) constituting at least partially a wall of the said accumulation chamber (40) opposite that in which the spraying nozzle (39) is provided and located at a distance from the latter of between 0.5 and 5 mm.

Dispenser for foam under pressure, containing a 
foaming liquid pressurized by a non-liquefiable compressed 

gas, equipped with a dispensing valve (7) and 
with an additional gas intake, the said dispenser being 

fitted with a push-button which includes a spraying 
member, characterized in that a dispensing valve (7) is 

used having additional gas intake such that the gas/liquid 
ratio of the mixture dispensed lies between 95/5 

and 99/1 (vol/vol), and in that the said dispenser is 
fitted with a push-button and with an end-piece, the said 

end-piece comprising a case (34) defining an accumulation 
chamber (40) into which the spraying member sprays the 

product to be dispensed through a spray nozzle (39) 
emerging into the said accumulation chamber (40), the 

said nozzle (39) having a diameter lying between 0.7 and 
2 mm, the said chamber (40) being closed by a porous frit 

(36) constituting, at least in part, a wall of the said 
accumulation chamber (40) opposite that in which the 

spray nozzle (39) is arranged and located at a distance 
from the latter lying between 0.5 and 5 mm. 
Dispenser according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the frit (36) has a thickness lying between 0.5 and 

4 mm, preferably 0.75 mm. 
Dispenser according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the size of the pores of the frit (36) lies between 

10 and 50 microns. 
Dispenser according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the size of the pores of the frit (36) lies between 

15 and 25 microns. 
Dispenser according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the size of the pores of the frit (36) is of the 

order of 20 microns. 
Dispenser according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the spray is produced under an 

absolute pressure lying between 1.5 and 6 bar. 
Dispenser according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the spray is produced under an absolute pressure 

lying between 3.5 and 6 bar.  
 
Dispenser according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the pressure is produced by the compressed air under 

pressure constituting the propellent gas for the product 
to be dispensed in the form of foam.
