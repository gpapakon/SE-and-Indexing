<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a polymer composition, in 
particular comprising a biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate and 
a plasticiser. Biodegradable polyesters for example the 
microbiologically produced polyhydroxyalkanoates can be adapted 
by the use of plasticiser compounds for applications where 
improved impact strength and decreased stiffness are important. 
Since such compounds should preferably also be biodegradable, 
may of the plasticisers used in synthetic polymer processing 
are not suitable for biodegradable polymers. Most commonly the 
glyceryl ester triacetin is used, but it is more volatile than 
could be desired during melt processing or storage at high 
ambient temperatures. The invention provides a composition comprising at least 
one biodegradable microbiologically produced polyhydroxyalkanoate 
as further defined hereinafter and a plasticising 
quantity, of at least one doubly esterified hydroxycarboxylic 
acid having at least 3 ester groups in its molecule. "Doubly esterified" means that at least some of the 
hydroxy groups of the hydroxycarboxylic acid are esterified 
with a carboxylic acid and at least some of the carboxy groups 
thereof are esterified with a phenol or preferably an alcohol. 
Preferably at least 90% molar, more preferably substantially 
100% molar of both such groups are so esterified. In principle it is relatively difficult to plasticise 
stereospecific polyhydroxyalkanoates of high crystallinity. 
Surprisingly we have found that the plasticisers of this 
invention are remarkably effective in plasticising such 
polymers.  
 The polyhydroxyalkanoate component is capable of a level 
of crystallinity, over 30%, especially 50-90%, in the absence 
of plasticiser. It has units of formula I: 
 
where m is in the range 1-2 and n is 2m. In very suitable 
polyesters units with m = 1 and m = 2 are copolymerised 
together. Particular polyesters contain a preponderance of m = 
1 units, especially with 70 to 98 mol % of such units, the 
balance being units in which m = 2. The molecular weight of 
the polymer is over 100000, especially over 300000. They are 
stereospecific with a D (-) configuration. The polyhydroxyalkanoate component is conveniently a 
blend of two or more polymers differing in the value of m. A 
particular example contains 
(a) polymer consisting essentially of Formula I units in 
which 2-5 mol % of units have m = 2, the rest m = 1; and (b) polymer consisting essentially of Formula I units in 
which 5-30 mol% of units have m = 2, the rest m = 1.
