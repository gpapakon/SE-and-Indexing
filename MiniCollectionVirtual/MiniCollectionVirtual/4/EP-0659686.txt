<ABSTRACT>
Process and plant for the purification of an aqueous alkali metal chloride solution containing iodide ions, according to which the iodide ions are oxidised to iodine by means of active chlorine generated in situ by electrolysis (4) of the solution and the iodine is removed over a basic halogenated anion exchange resin (5).

<CLAIMS>
Process for the purification of an aqueous alkali metal chloride solution
containing iodide ions, according to which the iodide ions are oxidized to iodine

by means of active chlorine and the iodine is removed on a basic, halogenated,
anion exchange resin, characterized in that the solution is electrolysed, in order to

generate the active chlorine in situ therein, in an electrolysis cell which comprises
neither a diaphragm nor a membrane.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that, before electrolysing
the solution, it is acidified.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in that the solution is
acidified to a pH of less than 3.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in that the solution is
acidified to a pH of 1.5 to 2.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the
electrolysis is adjusted so as to produce, in the solution, a potential substantially

equal to the oxidation-reduction potential of the oxidation reaction of the iodide
ions to molecular iodine by active chlorine.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in that the electrolysis is
adjusted so as to produce, in the solution, a potential of 550 to 600 mV.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that it is
applied to aqueous sodium chloride solutions.
Plant for the purification of an aqueous alkali metal chloride solution
containing iodide ions, comprising a reaction chamber (4) and an enclosure (5)

containing a basic, halogenated, anion exchange resin, characterized in that the
reaction chamber (4) comprises an electrolysis cell which comprises neither a

diaphragm nor a membrane.
Plant according to Claim 8, characterized in that the electrolysis cell (4)
is connected to a potentiostat (11). 
Plant according to Claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the electrolysis
cell (4) comprises a vertical tubular cathodic chamber (7), containing a porous

cathode (9), and a horizontal tubular anodic chamber (6) containing a porous
anode (8) and connected to the enclosure (5) containing the resin.
Plant according to claim 10, characterised in that the cathodic chamber
(7) is subjected to purging with a rising stream of air to facilitate discharge of the

hydrogen and, in that way, to avoid an explosive reaction with the chorine
produced at the anode (8).
