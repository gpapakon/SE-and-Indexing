<ABSTRACT>
The micro-controller system is comprised of a 
programmable microprocessor (13), and a plurality of 

memory units having a plurality of addressable memory 
registers. The memory units are in bus communication 

with the programmable microprocessor (13) and a 
application specific integrated circuit (15). The 

application specific integrated circuit (15) includes a 
circuit for dividing the memory units into a plurality of 

addressable regions in response to programming of the 
programmable microprocessor (13). The microprocessor is 

programmed such that the initial address for each of the 
regions is assigned by the most significant addressable 

bits. The addressable regions are programmably defined 
by an uppermost address for the region. The circuit 

includes address registers. The microprocessor can 
address each of the memory registers and write a 

respective uppermost address in the respective 
registers, the respective address corresponding to 

uppermost addressable registers of the respective 
addressable regions of the memory means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a address decoding 
system for a micro-controller system and, more 
particularly, to an address decoding system particularly 
suited for postage metering applications. European applications of even date are filed 
concurrently herewith corresponding to the following U.S. 
applications commonly assigned to Pitney Bowes Inc.: US 
Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,627, entitled 
MULTIPLE PULSE WIDTH MODULATION CIRCUIT; US Patent 
Application Serial No. 08/165,134, entitled DUAL MODE 
TIMER-COUNTER; US Patent Application Serial No. 
08/137,460, entitled DYNAMICALLY PROGRAMMABLE TIMER-COUNTER; 
US Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,774, 
entitled MEMORY ACCESS PROTECTION CIRCUIT WITH ENCRYPTION 
KEY; US Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,811, 
entitled MEMORY MONITORING CIRCUIT FOR DETECTING 
UNAUTHORIZED MEMORY ACCESS; US Patent Application Serial 
No. 08/163,771, entitled MULTI-MEMORY ACCESS LIMITING 
CIRCUIT FOR A MULTI-MEMORY DEVICE; US Patent Application 
Serial No. 08/163,810, entitled INTERRUPT CONTROLLER FOR 
AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT; US Patent Application Serial No. 
08/163,812, entitled ADDRESS DECODER WITH MEMORY WAIT 
STATE CIRCUIT; US Patent Application Serial No. 
08/163,813, entitled ADDRESS DECODER WITH MEMORY 
ALLOCATION AND ILLEGAL ADDRESS DETECTION FOR A MICRO-CONTROLLER 
SYSTEM; US Patent Application Serial No. 
08/164,100, entitled PROGRAMMABLE CLOCK MODULE FOR 
POSTAGE METERING CONTROL SYSTEM and US Patent Application 
Serial No. 08/163,629, entitled CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN 
ELECTRONIC POSTAGE METER HAVING A PROGRAMMABLE 
APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUIT. The disclosures of these European applications are 
hereby incorporated herein by reference.  In postage metering machine applications, and like 
machine applications, a micro-controller system is 
employed to control both machine control functions and 
system functions. System functions, for example, in the 
postage metering area, refer to such functions as funds 
accounting, external device interface and user interface 
functions. Machine control functions, for example, refer 
to such functions as motor control, print control and 
sensor control. In electronic postage metering machines, and like 
devices, it is customary to develop a specific micro-controller 
system for each postage meter model to 
accommodate the unique control requirements of each meter 
model. Conventionally, a micro-controller system, of the 
type customarily used in postage metering applications, 
is comprised of a
