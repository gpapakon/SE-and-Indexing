<ABSTRACT>
A polyolefin-coated steel material, in particular, one excellent in the resistances to impact, flaw and abrasion 
due to drifts of sand and so forth, and usable in steel structures. The invention material comprises an undercoated 

steel material and, formed on the surface thereof, a modified polyolefin resin layer and a polyolefin resin layer, and is 
characterized in that the polyolefin resin layer is further covered with a fiber cloth laminated with a modified polyolefin 

resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyolefin-covered
steel product and particularly to a polyolefin-covered
steel product for use in steel structures,
having excellent impact resistance, flaw resistance, and
resistance to abrasion by littoral drift or the like.Polyolefin-covered steel products, such as
polyolefin-covered metal pipes and polyolefin-covered
steel sheet piles, have become used widely as steel pipes
for piping, heavy-duty anticorrosive steel pipe piles in
the sea, and heavy-duty anticorrosive steel sheet piles,
by virtue of excellent anticorrosive properties.The polyolefin-covered steel products, however, are
likely to suffer dents during handling (such as
installation of piping on site; flaws on the surface of
the covering caused by soil, pebbles, and the like
during driving of polyolefin-covered steel
pipe and sheet piles; and flaws in
the covering during execution of works of
ripraps. Thus there is a requirement for the covering
layer to have further improved mechanical strength and
surface hardness. In order to solve
these problems Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 63-27248 proposes a polyolefin-covered
steel product comprising a steel
product which has been subjected to surface treatment, a
modified polyolefin resin layer and a polyolefin resin
layer laminated on the treated surface, and, laminated
thereon, a fiber reinforced modified polyolefin resin
layer comprising glass fiber or the like dispersed in a
silane modified polyolefin resin, for the purpose of
improving the impact and flaw resistance 
of the product. Even the latter
product having improved impact
and flaw resistance has the drawback that the covering,
when exposed in a sandy coastal region
rich in littoral drift, is markedly abraded, markedly
impairing durability.
Specifically, an enhancement in surface hardness and
strength of the material to a relatively high value as in
the case of the conventional covered steel products is
effective in preventing flaws by the action of large
instantaneous energy, such as flaws caused by collision
and dents. However, the conventional covered steel
products have the drawback that, when they are exposed to
littoral drift or the like, which abrades their surface
over a long period, they
are gradually abraded
because the covering is hard and fragile.
Therefore, in the prior art, it was difficult to provide
a polyolefin-covered steel product excellent in
resistance to flaws caused by collision or dents, as well
as in resistance to abrasion by littoral drift and the
like.An
