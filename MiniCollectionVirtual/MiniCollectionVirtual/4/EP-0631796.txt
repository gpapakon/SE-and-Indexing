<ABSTRACT>
An installation for taking up a flexible hose (1) for conveying 
liquid, such as a fire hose, comprises two pairs of turning 

pinch elements placed opposite one another (7,8,14,15), the pinch 
elements of each pair defining a nip of variable nip 

dimension, through which nips the hose can be transported in 
order to expel residual liquid therefrom, which variable nip 

dimension can be enlarged to permit the passage of a coupling (4) 
present in the hose. The nip dimensions are variable 

independently of one another and the nips are positioned with 
respect to one another in such a way that the hose can 

continuously be held compressed by at least one of the nips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an installation for taking 
up a flexible hose for conveying liquid, such as a fire hose, 
comprising two pairs of turning pinch elements placed 
opposite one another, the pinch elements of each pair 
defining a nip of variable nip dimension, through which nips 
the hose can be transported in order to expel residual liquid 
therefrom, which variable nip dimension can be enlarged to 
permit the passage of a coupling present in the hose. An installation of this type is disclosed in 
US-A-4 452 135. With this known installation the hose is conveyed 
over an endless conveyor belt on which a roller mechanism cap 
be held pressed down under spring loading. With this 
arrangement the hose is squeezed together between the 
conveyor belt and the roller mechanism. The water still 
contained in the hose is squeezed out by this means. A similar 
installation is disclosed in EP-A-0 360 603. Hoses of this type are made up of sections which are 
provided with hose couplings at both ends. The couplings are 
made of metal and therefore can not be compressed like the 
flexible material of the hose itself. Therefore at the moment 
the couplings have to pass, the roller mechanism moves away 
from the conveyor belt. Consequently, the water which has 
been squeezed out can flow back again. It is true that a 
second roller mechanism is provided which, by means of a 
rocker, moves towards the belt as the first roller mechanism 
moves away from the belt. Nevertheless, in view of the time 
which elapses between the release of the pressure exerted by 
the first roller mechanism and the application of pressure by 
the second roller mechanism, a relatively large amount of 
water can still flow back again, especially if said water is 
under any pressure. The quantities involved can be 
appreciable, especially if there are differences in height in 
the path taken by the hose. As a consequence of the removal 
of the driving force, the hose will also have a tendency to 
slide back under the weight of the water and the coupling. The aim of the invention is, therefore, to provide an 
installation for taking up a hose which is also suitable for  
 
emptying under pressure and for transporting a hose assembled by means 
of couplings. This aim is achieved in that of each pair, one pinch 
element is supported by means of its own swinging arm, each swinging 
arm being provided with adjustment means controlled by sensors for 
detection of a hose coupling, whereby the nip dimensions of the pairs 
are variable

Installation for taking up a flexible hose (1) for conveying 
liquid, such as a fire hose, comprising two pairs of turning pinch 

elements (7, 8, 14, 15) placed opposite one another, the pinch 
elements of each pair defining a nip of variable nip dimension, 

through which nips the hose can (1) be transported in order to expel 
residual liquid therefrom, which variable nip dimension can be 

enlarged to permit the passage of a coupling (4) present in the hose 
(1), 
characterized in that
 of each pair, one pinch element (14, 15) is 
supported by means of its own swinging arm (16), each swinging arm 

(16) being provided with adjustment means (18) controlled by sensors 
(20, 21, 22) for detection of a hose coupling (4), whereby the nip dimensions of 

the pairs are variable independently of one another, so that upon 
detection of a hose coupling (4) the nip dimensions of each pair of 

pinch elements (7, 8, 14, 15) can be increased independently of one 
another by the adjustment means (18) and the hose (1) can continuously 

be held compressed by at least one of the nips.  
 
Installation according to Claim 1, wherein two 
pinch elements are each constructed in 

the form of a roller body (7, 8) having a pliable surface, each said 
pinch element (7, 8) together with another opposing pinch element (14, 15) 

defining a nip. 
Installation according to Claim 2, wherein each 
roller body (7, 8) is connected to a rotary drive (11, 12, 13). 
Installation according to Claim 2 or 3, wherein an 
associated pressure roller (14, 15) is located against each roller 

body (7, 8), which pressure roller (14, 15) can be moved towards or away from 
the roller body (7, 8) in order, respectively, to reduce or increase 

the size of the nip. 
Installation according to Claim 4, wherein each 
pressure roller (14, 15) is movable by means of its own drive (18).  

 
Installation according to Claim 4 or 5, wherein 
each pressure roller (14, 15) is pressed in the 

direction of the associated roller body (7, 8).

claims, wherein a scraper element (80) is located in the drive 

direction in front of at least one nip for scraping clean one 
or both sides of the hose (1) pressed flat in the nip. 
Installation according to one of Claims 2-7, 
wherein each roller body (7, 8) is constructed in the form of a 

cylinder of pliable material which is closed at both ends and 
is pressurised internally.

claims, wherein the surface of each pinch element (7, 8, 14, 15) has a 

corrugated structure in order to increase friction. 
Installation according to one of the preceding 
claims, wherein a supporting construction (5) is provided on 

which the pinch elements (7, 8, 14, 15) are rotatably mounted, which 
supporting construction is rotatably supportable about a 

vertical centre line which runs transversely to the centre 
line of the pinch elements (7, 8, 14, 15). 
Installation according to Claim 10, wherein the 
supporting construction (5, 55) is movable between a working 

position, in which, viewed in the direction of transport, the 
front pair of pinch elements (7, 14) are at a lower height than the 

rear pair of pinch elements (8, 15), and a rest position.

the supporting construction (55) has a rotary shaft (56) which is 

supported on a holder (57), which holder (57) is movably guided in an 
essentially vertical guide path (59).

block, with which it is guided in the guide path (59), and on the 

other side is supported by a cylinder jack (63).
