<ABSTRACT>
The invention that relates to recombinant raccoon poxvirus useful as a Vaccine Against 
Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus Disease. The recombinant raccoon poxvirus has at 

least one internal gene comprising a DNA sequence encoding a member selected from 
the group consisting of the nucleocapsid (N) and transmembrane (M/E1) proteins of 

Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the prophylaxis of disease caused by
feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), using recombinant raccoon pox viruses (RRPVs)
expressing the nucleocapsid and transmembrane proteins of FIPV as vaccines.Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) induces a systemic infection in
cats that is often fatal. The effusive form of the disease is characterized by accumulation
of fibrinous ascitic fluid. The non-effusive form of the disease is characterized by
granulomatous lesions in multiple organs including, but not limited to, liver, spleen,
kidneys, lung, and intestines. Reviewed in Barlough, J.E. and C. A. Stoddart. Feline
Coronaviral Infections in C.E. Greene (Ed.). Infectious Diseases of the Dog and Cats.
W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA, 1990, pp. 300-312.Feline infectious peritonitis virus is a coronavirus composed of three major
structural proteins: The S (spike) protein, the E1 or M (transmembrane) protein, and the
N (nucleocapsid) protein. Venema et al., Virology 181: 327-335, 1991 and Dale, et al.,
EPO 0,376, 744.Prior vaccines intended to prevent FIPV infection have actually been
shown to exacerbate the disease caused by this virus. Pedersen, N.C. and J.W. Black,
Am. J. Vet. Res. 44: 229-234, 1983; Vennema H., et al., J. Virol. 64: 1407-1409,
1990; Barlough, J.E., Can. J. Comp. Med. 49: 303-307, 1985; Barlough J.E. et al.,
Lab. Anim. Sci. 34: 592-597, 1984; Stoddart, C.A., et al., Res. Vet. Sci. 45: 383-388,
1988; and Pedersen, N.C., Adv. Vet. Sci. Comp. Med. 33: 413-428, 1989. This 
phenomenon apparently reflects an immune enhancement of infection mediated by
immunoglobulins produced in response to the virus, in particular by those antibodies
directed against the S protein. Olsen C. W. et al., J. Virol. 4: 175-189, 1981.
Therefore, the best candidate vaccine for prophylaxis of this disease would be a
preparation that induces strong cell-mediated immunity in the absence of enhancing
antibodies. This could be accomplished with a vaccine that lacks the outer envelope
protein but contains the other structural proteins of FIPV (N and E1). Prior attempts
to vaccinate cats with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the N or E1 proteins of
FIPV, however, have failed to induce strong protective immunity. Venema et al.,
Virology 181:327-335, 1991 and Dale, et al., European Patent Application 0,376,744.
See also, Venema, European Patent Application 0,411,684.What is needed in the art, therefore, is an effective vaccine against FIPV
that utilizes the N and E1 proteins, or
