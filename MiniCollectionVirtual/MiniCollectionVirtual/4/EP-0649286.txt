<ABSTRACT>
The footwear has a knitted sock and a shoe in combination. The knitted sock has a toe portion formed of hydrophilic knit fabric and an instep portion adjacent the toe portion formed of hydrophobic knit fabric. Perspiration from the toe portion of the foot of the wearer is absorbed by the knit hydrophilic toe portion of the knitted sock and wicked therefrom by the hydrophobic knit instep portion of the knitted sock. The shoe has a tongue portion overlying and contacting the hydrophobic knit instep portion of the knitted sock. The tongue portion (70) of the shoe has overlying inner (80) and outer (100) fabric layers formed of hydrophilic fabric and an intermediate fabric layer (90) positioned between the overlying inner and outer hydrophilic fabric layers. The intermediate fabric layer (90) has a medial portion formed of a hydrophobic fabric layer (94) and opposite side portions formed of hydrophilic fabric layers (92). The inner hydrophilic fabric layer (80) overlies and, is in contacting engagement with the hydrophobic knit instep portion of the knitted sock. The perspiration from the hydrophobic knit instep portion of the knitted sock is absorbed by the overlying and contacting inner hyrophilic fabric layer (80) and the hydrophilic fabric opposite side portions (92) of the intermediate fabric layer (90) and wicked therefrom by the contacting hydrophobic fabric layer medial portion (94) of the intermediate fabric layer. The perspiration (130) is then transferred from the hydrophobic fabric layer medial portion (94) to the overlying outer hydrophilic fabric layer (100) of the tongue portion of the shoe for evaporation therefrom to atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to footwear and 
more particularly to footwear for providing added comfort 
to the wearer by facilitating the removal and dissipation 
of perspiration from the foot of the wearer. Generally, moisture or perspiration forms in the 
foot area of a person especially when a sock or shoe is 
worn on the foot. The perspiration may become excessive 
when the person exercises, such as when hiking or 
running. This excess perspiration accumulating around 
the foot and in the footwear is often uncomfortable and 
irritating. Previously, shoes have been designed and constructed 
to keep moisture out of the shoe with little or no 
consideration for perspiration formed within the shoe. 
An example of such shoes may be seen in U.S. Patent No. 
2,897,610 to Campagna entitled Heat Insulated, 
Gusset-Type, Waterproof Footwear. Recently, shoes have 
been designed which attempt to keep the innermost layer 
of the shoe nearest the foot dry by providing a high 
moisture permeable and low moisture holding material for 
this layer of the entire shoe and a layer overlying the 
innermost layer for further insulating the foot from 
moisture. An example of such a shoe may be seen in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,430,811 to Okada entitled Footwear. Also,  
 
other shoes have been designed which recognize the need 
to ventilate the shoe by providing perforations in the 
tongue area of the shoe. An example of this type of shoe 
is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,458,429 to Schmid 
entitled Tongue for a Shoe, Particularly a Sport Shoe, 
and a Shoe Including a Tongue. Unfortunately, these prior shoes failed to recognize 
that about two thirds of the perspiration from the wearer 
accumulates in the ball and toe areas of the foot. Simply 
insulating the foot from outside moisture, absorbing 
moisture into the footwear, and providing ventilation to 
the shoe through a series of perforations did not solve 
the problem of accumulation of excess perspiration around 
the ball and toe areas of the foot. The inventor of the present invention, on the other 
hand, recognized that the prior footwear failed to 
adequately remove perspiration from the ball and toe 
areas and, therefore, developed and patented a unique 
sock, disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,898,007 entitled 
Moisture Management Sock, to solve this problem. While 
this unique moisture management sock improved the 
dissipation of moisture from conventional shoes, further 
improvement is still highly desirable. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to

<CLAIMS>
Footwear for providing added comfort to the 
wearer by a multi-layered means for facilitating the 

removal and dissipation of perspiration (130) from the 
foot of the wearer, the improvement comprising: 


(a) a knitted sock (130) and a shoe (130), 
(b) said knitted sock (150) having a toe 
portion (152) and an instep portion (154) adjacent 

thereto, said toe portion (152) comprising a hydrophilic 
knit fabric and said instep portion (154) comprising a 

hydrophobic knit fabric so that perspiration (130) from 

the toe portion of the foot of the wearer is absorbed by 
said hydrophilic knit toe portion (152) and wicked 

therefrom by said hydrophobic knit instep portion (154) 
of said knitted sock (150), 
(c) said shoe (30) comprising a tongue portion 
(70) overlying and contacting said hydrophobic knit 

instep portion (154), said tongue portion (70) having an 
overlying fabric layer (100) comprising a hydrophilic 

fabric and an underlying fabric layer (90) being in 
contacting engagement therewith, said underlying fabric 

layer (90) having a medial portion (94) comprising a 
hydrophobic fabric layer and opposite side portions (92) 

comprising hydrophilic fabric layers, said underlying 
fabric layer (90) being in contacting engagement with 

said hydrophobic instep portion (154) of said knitted 
sock (150) so that perspiration (130) from said 

hydrophobic knit instep portion (154) is absorbed by said 
contacting hydrophilic fabric opposite side portions (92) 

and wicked therefrom by said hydrophobic fabric layer 
medial portion (94) and thereby transferred to said
