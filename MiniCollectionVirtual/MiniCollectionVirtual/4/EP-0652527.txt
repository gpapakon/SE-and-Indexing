<ABSTRACT>
After document data have been inputted by operating 
character keys, if an automatic setting key is operated to 

allow the print character size to be set automatically and a 
print key is then operated, printing process control is 

executed and the greatest character size printable on a tape 
mounted in the tape printing apparatus is set (S33), a base 

line position shifting process is performed so that the 
character is positioned around the center of the width of the 

tape (S34). Then, dot image data in the print character size 
that is set on the basis of the document data is generated 

(S31) and the dot image data is output to the printing 
mechanism to be printed on the tape (S32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tape printing apparatus
for printing desired characters such as letters and symbols
onto a tape, and more particularly, to a tape printing
apparatus of a type capable of printing characters onto a
tape so that the characters may be aligned along a
longitudinal direction of the tape.United States Patent No. 5,066,152 has proposed a
tape printing apparatus, in which a font ROM incorporated in
its controller stores dot pattern data of plural classes of
character sizes. An operator operates the tape printing
apparatus to input characters such as letters and symbols
desired to be printed on a tape' (desired document) and to
designate a character size, with which the characters are
desired to be printed. In the present specification, various
characters, such as alphanumeric characters and letters,
i.e., alphabetic characters and letters ("a", "B", ..., for
example) and numeric characters ("1", "2", ..., for example),
other kinds of characters and letters, such as hieroglyph
letters, various symbols, such as "♂", "♀", etc., and other
kinds of various characters and letters to be printed on a
tape are all referred to as "characters." The tape printing 
apparatus prints the inputted characters onto a tape
(printing medium) which has a width of 10 mm, 24 mm, or the
like so that the characters are aligned along the
longitudinal direction of the tape. The tape printing
apparatus is further provided with various editing functions.The size of the characters constituting the document
is restricted or limited by the width of the tape, onto which
the document is desired to be printed. Accordingly, the
operator has to designate the character size, dependently on
the width of the tape to be printed with the desired
characters.Generally, in order to print alphabetic characters,
including capital letters and small letters, onto a tape, a
base line is defined to extend in the longitudinal direction
of the tape. All the capital letters of alphabetic
characters are printed to be aligned along the base line with
their bottom points being located on the base line. In other
words, an entire part of each of the capital letters is
located just on the base line, and no part of the capital
letter protrudes down from the base line. Similarly, some of
the small letters, such as "a" and "b", are printed to be
aligned along the base line with their bottom being located
on the base line to have no part protruding down from the
base line. These small letters and capital letters are
referred to as "non-protruding
