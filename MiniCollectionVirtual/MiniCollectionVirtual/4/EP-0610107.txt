<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates particularly to a mascara applicator. This applicator comprises a hollow application structure (4) having peripheral openings capable of being charged with mascara and developing transversely to the axis of the structure, providing communication between the inside and the outside of the latter. The applicator also includes a shuttle (52) which is movable in translation between a first position in which it is engaged tightly in the structure (4) in order to contribute to the charging with mascara and a second position in which it clears the said openings, for combing. The applicator combines the requirements, on the one hand, of charging and of application of the mascara and, on the other hand, of careful combing of the eyelashes.
