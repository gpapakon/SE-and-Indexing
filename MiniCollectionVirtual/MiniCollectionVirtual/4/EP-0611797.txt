<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of this invention are thermoplastic composition as defined
in the claims containing an aromatic polycarbonate resin and (i) dialkyl and/or
dicycloalkyl monosulfides or polysulfides in an amount of 0.001 to 5
weight %, preferably 0.005 to 1 weight %, in particular 0.01 to 0.8
weight %, each based on 100 weight % of aromatic polycarbonate,
and optionally (ii) aliphatic or cycloaliphatic monoalcohols or
polyalcohols or their derivatives in an amount of 0.001 to 2 weight %,
preferably 0.001 to 1.5 weight %, based on 100 weight % of an
aromatic polycarbonate.The polycarbonate compositions of the invention are stabilized
against gamma γ-rays and, therefore, are well suited for medical
applications in a multitude of ways, especially for the manufacture of
equipment or equipment parts which must be sterilized either before
or after use through ionizing radiation, while avoiding the occurrence
of excessive yellowing.EP-A-303 894 teaches to include organic thioethers together with
phenolic antioxydants to stabilise polymers made of unsaturated
hydrocarbons, particularly PP, against gamma-rays.Thermoplastic, aromatic polycarbonates in the sense of the
invention are both homopolycarbonates and copolycarbonates; the
polycarbonates can be linear or branched by known means. A portion, up to 80 mol %, preferably between 20 and 50 mol
% of the carbonate groups in the appropriate polycarbonates based
on the invention can be replaced by aromatic dicarboxylic acid ester
groups. Such polycarbonates can contain not only built-in carbonic
acid radicals, but also acid radicals of aromatic dicarboxylic acids in
the molecular chain, more precisely described as aromatic polyester
carbonates. These are referred to in the present application for
purposes of simplicity under the generic term of thermoplastic,
aromatic polycarbonates.The production of the polycarbonate useful in the context of the
invention is known. These are produced from diphenols, carbonic
acid derivatives, optionally with chain terminators and branching
agents, whereby a part of the carbonic acid derivatives may be
replaced by aromatic dicarboxylic acid or derivatives of dicarboxylic
acid for the production of the polyester carbonate.Details of polycarbonate production have been specified in
hundreds of patent specifications for about 40 years. A few of them
are pointed out, for example, in Schnell's Chemistry and Physics of
Polycarbonates, Polymer Reviews, Volume 9, Inter-science
Publishers, New York, London, Sydney 1964; D. C. PREVORSEK, B.
