<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the composition of a box-shaped body (2), the 
assumption is made of a flat expansion of the box-shaped body, 

which expansion is constructed as a coherent entity of walls (3-6) 
which are movable with respect to each other, whereupon the 

walls (3,5,6) are folded and the box-shaped body (2) is formed. The 
edges of 

the walls are thereby brought together and affixed to each other 
by means of gluing with, preferably, a two-component glue. The 

flat expansion of the box-shaped body (2) is usually made by means 
of the injection moulding of a plastic material. 
The box-shaped body (2) which is constructed in accordance with 
this method has walls which stand perpendicularly with respect 

to each other, a fact which makes the box-shaped body 
particularly suitable for use in a car for the fitting of 

accessories such as audio equipment, car radios, cassette 
players, etc. A vibration-free fitting without additional aids 

is simplified by the perpendicular running of the walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
The current invention pertains to a method for the composition 
of a box-shaped body in addition to a box-shaped body constructed 
in accordance with the method. In a known method for the preparation of the box-shaped body, 
the body or components thereof intended for subsequent assembly 
are constructed with the aid of a mould. Because the box-shaped 
body must be easily removable from the mould, the walls thereof 
run in a direction slightly convergent towards each other, 
leading to a situation which is undesirable, for example, in the 
application as a holder for components to be placed in the box-shaped 
body. In particular in the application as a holder for 
accessories in a vehicle, as a result of the non-perpendicular 
walls, additional measures must be taken to prevent the annoying 
audible vibration or movement of the accessories in the box-shaped 
body. In that application of the box-shaped body, whereby the walls 
thereof must be equipped with holes, ridges or grooves, the known 
method for the construction thereof is complex because, in that 
case, movable sleeves or partitions must be applied in the mould. An aim of the current invention is to provide a less 
complicated method and a box-shaped body suitable for several 
applications. To that end, and in accordance with the invention, the 
assumption is made of a flat expansion of the box-shaped body, 
which expansion is constructed as a coherent entity of walls 
which are movable with respect to each other, whereupon the 
walls are folded and the box-shaped body is formed. An advantage of the method in accordance with the invention is 
that, during the construction of the box-shaped body, it is no 
longer necessary to make use of partitions which are moved 
in/out respectively of the mould for the forming of the ribs, 
grooves, holes and the like in the walls of the box-shaped body. 
On the basis of the construction of the flat expansion, the  
 
partitions can be formed rigidly in the mould, whereby the 
construction process becomes simpler, faster and less expensive 
to implement. In a preferential embodiment, the method in accordance with 
the invention comprises the forming of the box-shaped body by 
means of gathering the edges of the walls until the desired box 
form arises, subsequent to which the box pre-formed in this 
manner can be placed in its destination, which destination can 
be, for example, the central console in a car. The box is held 
in position and in shape by means of self-tapping screws, rivets 
or the like, which
