<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a photocathode, a 
phototube, and a photodetecting apparatus. To perform photodetection including detection of 
one- or two-dimensional position information of weak 
light, an apparatus constituted by an image intensifier 
combined with a solid-state image sensor is generally 
used. In this apparatus, photoelectrons are excited by 
photons which are incident from the input window of a 
housing on a photocathode. The photoelectrons emitted 
from the photocathode into a vacuum are focused and 
accelerated by an electron lens system. Thereafter, the 
photoelectrons are focused by a phosphor and converted 
into an optical signal again, thereby performing 
intensification of the light. Photoelectric conversion 
of this intensified optical signal is performed by the 
solid-state image sensor such as a CCD again, and 
position information is extracted as an electrical  
 
signal. A photomultiplier having a position detecting 
function is also used for photodetection. In this 
apparatus, the anode of the photomultiplier is divided 
and multiplied to perform photodetection, thereby 
obtaining position information. In addition, another 
example of a photomultiplier having the position 
detecting function is described in Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open No. 60-20441. In this photomultiplier, a 
photocathode is formed on the inner wall of a faceplate. 
A mesh electrode is provided between the photocathode and 
a focusing electrode for forming an electric field which 
guides photoelectrons emitted from the photocathode to a 
first-stage dynode. This mesh electrode is arranged on 
only one side at a position away from the photocathode by 
a 1/10 distance between the photocathode and the focusing 
electrode. The mesh electrode forms a field distribution 
for gradually preventing the photoelectrons from reaching 
the first-stage dynode from one side to the other side. 
Of the photoelectrons emitted from the entire 
photoelectron emission surface of the photocathode, 
photoelectrons on one side are prevented from reaching 
the first-stage dynode when a bias voltage is applied to 
the mesh electrode. More specifically, the orbits of the 
photoelectrons are changed to multiply only 
photoelectrons emitted from a predetermined portion of  
 
the emission surface and output them as an electrical 
signal. On the basis of the output signal level and the 
bias voltage level applied to the mesh electrode, 
photodetection with position resolution is performed by 
an external determination apparatus. In this
