<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus operates on a time division multiplex communication system
and includes a power amplifier circuit (12), signal processing circuit (11, 15),

battery (20), stepping up circuit (23), storing circuit (24), and a switch circuit
(21). The power amplifier circuit amplifies a transmitted signal intermittently

transmitted at predetermined periods to a radio transmission power level.
The signal processing circuit is operated by a voltage lower than the

operating voltage of the power amplifier circuit. The battery is for example a
battery constituted of a lithium ion battery, of which the unit cell has a full-charged

voltage lower than the operating voltage of the power amplifier
circuit and an ultimate voltage higher than the operating voltage of the

signal processing circuit, with a large voltage difference between the full-charged
voltage and the ultimate voltage. The stepping up circuit is a circuit

with small output current capacity, operating at the voltage within the range
changing from the full-charged voltage to the ultimate voltage of the

battery, and amplifies the output voltage of the battery at least to the
operating voltage of the power amplifier circuit. The storing circuit stores

power of which the voltage is stepped up by the stepping up circuit. The
switch circuit is provided between the storing circuit and the power-supply

terminal of the power amplifier circuit and supplies the stored power in the
storing circuit to the power amplifier circuit only while the power amplifier

circuit is amplifying the transmitted signal in substance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power
circuit and a radiocommunication apparatus using the
same. The present invention, more particularly, relates
to a power circuit to supply power by stepping up the
output voltage of a battery and a radiocommunication
apparatus using the power circuit.In mobile communication equipment such as a
portable telephone which a user can carry and use for
communication, its small size and light weight is an
important factor for convenience of users.Electronic circuits incorporated in
radiocommunication apparatuses are generally formed with
semiconductor devices so that the apparatus may be small
in size, light and economical on power. Now, of the
parts mounted on a radiocommunication apparatus, one
main element which is particularly bulky and weighty is 
a battery as the power source to operate electronic
circuits in the radiocommunication apparatus.While electronic circuits in a radio
communication apparatus are designed to achieve energy
saving, it is required for the apparatus to amplify its
transmitted signal to a certain level in order that the
transmitted wave output, i.e., the transmitted distance,
is kept above a certain value. Therefore, the power
amplifier circuit used for the amplification is operated
by a voltage higher than the operating voltage of the
circuits for processing transmitted and received
signals.Thus, in a radiocommunication apparatus, there
are incorporated circuits operated by at least two kinds
of voltages, i.e., signal processing circuits which are
constituted of a microprocessor, or DSP, DRAM, and the
like, operated by a low voltage, and a power amplifier
circuit operated by a higher voltage than that for the
signal processing circuits. Therefore, it is required
for the power circuit to supply at least two kinds of
voltages.The power consumed in the power amplifier
circuit is larger than the power consumed in the signal 
processing circuits. Hence, the battery capacity is
generally specified by the transmitted wave power.In order to increase the transmission
distance, i.e., transmitted wave power, it is required
to increase the battery capacity. However, the increase
in the battery capacity runs counter to the requirement of
the radiocommunication apparatus to be light and
portable.As a method to overcome the above mentioned
problem, there is a method for example disclosed in the
gazette of Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. Sho
61-144131. The method disclosed in the gazette of
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. Sho 61-144131
