<ABSTRACT>
A method for reacting to disturbances that occur in an industrial process includes the steps of extracting information from the industrial process as to occurrence of normal events and occurrence of disturbances (10), transmitting the extracted information to a disturbance filter (26, 28) which includes a leaky bucket having a defined disturbance step and floor and ceiling height for the disturbances (22), and triggering an alarm when occurrence of disturbances in the industrial process falls without the defined disturbance step and floor and ceiling height (24). As mentioned above, the present invention also provides a rigorous method of setting parameters (16) within a leaky bucket algorithm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the supervision of errors (or "disturbances")
in industrial processes and, more particularly, to
disturbance supervision algorithms used in the operation of
telecommunications exchanges.Errors periodically occur in virtually every industrial process
known to man. Thus, most mechanized processes include some way
to detect the occurrence of errors in order to call them to the
attention of an operator when required. The significance of an
error within a process is determined by the nature of the error
as well as the frequency with which such errors occur. Moreover,
in complex industrial complexes such as those performed by
telecommunications switching exchanges and digital computers,
such occurrences are generally referred to as a disturbance,
simply indicating the occurrence of an anomalous event within the
process. For example, a disturbance can be a parity error during
the exchange of data, or a sporadic hardware fault within the
system. Other examples of abnormal events within such systems
referred to as disturbances include:
a. A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error;b. Congestion within the system;c. The occurrence of a greater number of bit errors in a
particular time frame than the bit correction algorithm can cope
with;d. Software exceptions within the system; ande. Data inconsistencies detected during runtime.Single disturbances within such systems rarely produce any need
for the raising of an alarm; but when disturbances become too
frequent within a system, a technician should generally be 
notified so as to be able to take remedial action to prevent
system failure. Moreover, it is generally the number of
disturbances as a proportion of the number of events during
which a disturbance could possibly occur which is of most
interest to an operator of a process, e.g., five disturbances
within the sequence of one hundred events is of much greater
interest than ten disturbances during the occurrence of a
million such events. International publication number WO
79/00585, published August 23, 1979, describes an arrangement
for measuring the ratio between a number of events occurring
after each other in a first and second series of events. The
monitoring and measurement of the number of disturbances which
occur during a sequence of events and the production of an
alarm when the number of disturbances become too great is known
as disturbance supervision.The concepts of disturbance and disturbance supervision are
applicable to virtually all fields of industrial processing.

A method for the supervision of disturbances that occur in an industrial process,
each of said disturbances being of a type, said disturbances having a frequency of

occurrence in said industrial process, said method comprising the steps of:

extracting information from said industrial process as to the occurrence of normal
events and occurrence of disturbances, disturbances of the same type defining a

disturbance case;
transmitting said extracted information to a disturbance filter, said disturbance filter
comprising at least one leaky bucket having a disturbance case associated therewith,

said at least one leaky bucket further having defined disturbance step, floor and ceiling
height parameters defining an acceptable disturbance frequency; and
triggering an alarm when the frequency of disturbances in said industrial process
occurs above said defined acceptable disturbance frequency,
