<ABSTRACT>
An air bearing slider according to the present in­
vention provides a programmable slider wherein the fly 

height of a the read/write head may be conveniently 
controlled using electrical signals. In an air bearing 

slider according to the present invention, the rear of 
the slider is made to fly lower by altering the angle 

of attack of a rear air bearing region. In one embodi­
ment of the present invention, a slider configuration 

includes a first air bearing region (31) at the 
leading edge of the slider and a second air bearing 

region (32) at the slider's trailing edge. The first 
air bearing region includes a tapered region (37). A 

deformable central region (33), including a non air 
bearing surface, joins the first and second air 

bearing regions and controls the relative angle 
between the air bearing surfaces. The relative angle 

is adjusted by deforming the central region using a 
layer of e.g. piezoelectric material which overlays 

the central region. A conventional read/write head is 
placed on the rear portion of the second air bearing 

region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to air 
bearing sliders and more particularly to a pro­
grammable air bearing slider wherein the fly height of 
the read/write head is controlled by electronically 
changing the relative angle between the front and rear 
air bearing surfaces of the Air Bearing Slider. The present invention relates to programmable or 
electronically controllable air bearing sliders. Air 
bearing sliders are primarily used as mounting plat­
forms for read/write heads in, for example, hard disk 
drives. In such environments it is necessary to 
carefully control the height of the read/write head. 
That is, it is necessary to control the distance 
between the read/write head and the disk surface to 
optimize the read/write characteristics. Increased 
recording densities result in the necessity of 
designing read/write heads which fly extremely close 
to the recording surface. In order to move the 
read/write heads closer to the disk, it is generally 
necessary for the sliders themselves to fly closer to 
the disks. Unfortunately, the slider fly height is 
limited by head-disk interactions which increase as 
the slider gets closer to the disk. As the number of 
head disk interactions increase, the reliability of 
the system decreases. Head disk interactions may be 
caused by, for example, debris on the disk or slider 
or by disk asperities.  Therefore, it would be advantageous to design a slider 
which reduces the number of head-disk interactions. 
Reducing the number of head-disk interactions may be 
accomplished by, for example, designing a programmable 
slider which flys low during a read or write operation 
and returns to a safe height between read/write 
operations. A disk drive generally includes a number 
of read/write heads, each mounted on a separate 
slider. A specific head (and thus slider) is normally 
used for reading or writing less than 1 percent of the 
time. Thus, programmable designs provide a 
substantial increase in reliability when compared to 
designs wherein the read/write head flies low all the 
time. Air bearing sliders have been designed to adjust the 
fly height of the read/write head using a number of 
methods. For example, the read/write head may be 
mounted to the slider using a piezoelectric coupling 
which lowers the head independent of the slider. In 
other air bearing sliders, the fly height is con­
trolled through the use of piezoelectric elements in 
the slider structure to change the curvature of the 
air bearing surface, increasing or reducing the
