<ABSTRACT>
A recombinant plant genome contains a gene cascade such that it is incapable of producing a mature plant but requires the presence of a chemical inducer. The gene cascade includes a gene switch which is inducible by external application of a chemical inducer and which controls expression of a gene product which affects expression of a second gene in the genome. Survival or development of the plant is dependant upon either expression or non-expression of the second gene and application of the inducer, therefore, selects whether or not the plant develops. In one example the second gene encodes a cytotoxic molecule and expression of that gene is fatal to the plant. In another example the second gene encodes a desirable characteristic which may be excised selectively by applying or withholding chemical application. The second gene may be placed under control of a development regulated promoter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the
containment of plant germplasm. More generally,
the invention relates to the molecular control of
plant development through to maturity and seed
production.Agriculture uses many crop plants for the
production of food for human consumption, for
commercial processes yielding products for human
consumption, for animal feedstuff production, for
the development of industrial products and other
purposes. The process involves the planting by the
farmer of seed which usually has been purchased
from a seed producer. The product produced by the
crop be it the whole plant, the seed or fruit of
the plant, is harvested and is then used for the
various food applications mentioned above.The supplied hybrid or inbred seed may
incorporate novel genetic information introduced by
transformation of the crop giving novel agronomic
features such as tolerance to herbicides, insect
pests, and fungal diseases, improved yield and/or
quality of the harvested product, and novel
mechanisms for the control of plant fertility.
Such improvements made possible through
biotechnological research, improve the quality of
the plant breeding and improve the agronomic
performance of the seed supplied to the farmer.A problem addressed by the present invention 
is the containment of crop plants within the area of cultivation. Seeds of
cultivated crop plants may be conveyed outside the defined growing area by
a number of routes (by birds or small mammals or simply by being dropped
during post-harvest transport of a seed crop) where they assume the status of
weeds, or they may remain as volunteers in a subsequent crop in later years.
It would clearly be appropriate, if it were possible, that cultivated crops be
confined to the growing area and prevented from persisting in the wild.A second agricultural problem addressed by the present invention is
that of pre-harvest sprouting. This is a particular problem with small
grained cereals where rainfall or high humidity prior to harvest causes seed
to begin to germinate whilst still in the ear. It would clearly be
advantageous to the farmer, if it were possible, that pre-harvest sprouting be
prevented thus assuring that high yielding, quality grain is supplied to the
end user.It is desirable to provide methods for containing cultivated crops
within a designated growing area and the prevention of volunteers.A further object of the invention is to obviate or mitigate the
problem of pre-harvest sprouting.According to the present invention there is provided a
