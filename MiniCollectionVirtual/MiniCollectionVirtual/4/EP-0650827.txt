<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a package padding and 
an apparatus for forming same. The package padding is 

continuous and web-like and formed of superimposed 
paper courses (1,2,3). On the substantial surface area 

of one paper course (2) has with a pair of shaping 
rolls (16,17) been embossed a cellular padding structure. 

The package padding comprises a punch joint region 
(5) formed with the aid of a pair of punch joint 

rolls (18,19), and an intact area (7) substantially 
free of punchings, the package padding being more bulky 

and fluffy in the region thereof than in the punch 
joint region (5). In the embossed paper course (2) have 

by means of the speed differential of the punching 
rolls (18,19) and the shaping rolls (16,17) 

been folded pleats (8) so that the package padding 
contains per unit length of the package padding a 

greater length of paper material of the second paper 
course (2) than of paper material of the first paper 

course (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns package padding 
material as defined in the preamble to Claim 1. The 
invention further concerns an apparatus, defined in the 
preamble to Claim 11, for forming package padding material. In prior art e.g. through the reference 
US 5,203,761 an apparatus is known which has been arranged 
to form paper into continuous and web-like 
package padding material which comprises superimposed 
paper courses. The paper courses present a continuous 
series of successive and side-by-side eminences embossed 
in the paper courses. This serves the purpose of 
endowing the package padding with a cellular padding 
structure, and thus it increases the bulk of the paper 
web substantially. In the apparatus of the reference 
all paper course webs are run superimposed through 
between shaping rolls, the paper courses thus being 
pressed between said shaping rolls, whereby a cellular 
relief pattern is produced in them. Hereafter, the 
paper courses are separated and conducted by mutually 
different paths to combining rolls so that the eminences 
in the paper courses will be offset relative to 
each other so that they are no longer in register when 
they are once more superimposed, whereby a multiply 
cellular structure is obtained. The combining rolls are 
not arranged to break up the structure of the package 
padding web. The problem with the apparatus and package 
padding known in the art is that, in practice, the 
individual paper courses of the paper padding tend to 
become detached from each other, and this will substantially 
impair the usability of the package padding 
and retention of its fluffiness. This is because keeping 
the package padding of prior art as a fluffy, padding  
 
structure would imply that in no situation whatsoever 
the paper courses would become mutually displaced 
into a relative position in which they were 
together pressed and in which the eminences and depressions 
of the paper courses are in register and will 
settle one into the other. The previously known package padding and apparatus 
are further embarrassed by the problem that all 
paper courses are passed through the same pairs of 
rolls, as a result of which the structure of the package 
padding is similar throughout over the whole of its 
area, and this for instance hampers any attempts to 
fold the paper padding double. Detachment of the paper 
courses from each other is specifically the particular 
problem encountered when folding the material. The apparatus known in the art moreover poses 
the problem
