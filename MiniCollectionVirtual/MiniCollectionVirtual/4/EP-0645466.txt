<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a highly hard and
highly active Ti-Cu based alloy suitable for use as a
catalyst material capable of catalyzing, for example,
hydrogenation of carbon monoxide.Catalysts for use in the reaction in which
carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to produce
hydrocarbons and water have pretty widely been
investigated, which include ruthenium-bearing alumina
and Ti-Cu based alloy catalysts. However, it is often
difficult to obtain a catalyst having a large specific
surface area required for catalytic activity from
crystalline alloys produced by the conventional
processes because of their nonuniform chemical
properties and brittleness.On the other hand, it has recently become known
that a microcrystalline structure having a size
ranging from several tens of nanometers to several
microns can be obtained by the heat treatment of an
amorphous metal. Investigations of reinforced
materials in which the above crystalline structure is
utilized are being promoted, creating some results. A
further refinement of the microcrystalline structure
would lead to a further improvement of mechanical
properties and a more effective exhibition of 
catalytic activities. However, it has been difficult
to stably obtain a finer microcrystalline structure by
the use of the conventional techniques.An object of the present invention is to provide
a Ti-Cu based alloy suitable for use as a catalyst
material having increased catalytic activity and
improved mechanical properties by further refining
the size of the microcrystalline structure and
stabilizing the presence thereof in the Ti-Cu based
alloy.In a first aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a Ti-Cu based alloy catalyst
material having a composition including at least one
element selected from the group consisting of V, Ni,
Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co as a partial substitute element
for Ti and/or Cu in a composition represented by the
general formula Ti100-aCua, wherein "a" is, in atomic
%, 30 ≤ a ≤ 50, 0.1 to 20 atomic % in the general
formula Ti100-aCua being substituted with said at
least one element, in which a fine Ti-Cu intermetallic
compound having a mean particle size of 10 nm or less
is uniformly precipitated in an amorphous phase and/or
an α-Ti matrix.The above intermetallic compound is contained in
the alloy catalyst in an amount of 5 to 90% by volume.In a second aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a process for producing the
aforestated Ti-Cu based alloy catalyst material which
comprises preparing an alloy having the
