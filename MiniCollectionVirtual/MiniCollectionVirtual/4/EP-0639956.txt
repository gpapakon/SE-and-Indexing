<CLAIMS>
Device for extending living tissue, characterized in that it comprises at least 
one resilient means (8) whose outside dimensions, in its active position enabling said 

tissue to be extended, are such that a portion of its perimeter corresponds substantially 
to and is superposed with the edges (13) of the area of tissue to be treated, and at least 

two fastening means (7) each secured to an end of a resilient means (8) of the device, 
opposite to each other in the direction of active resilience of said means (8) and 

enabling it to be fixed to said tissue along said edges (13). 
Extension device for living tissue according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said resilient means (8) is a flexible piece of silicone type elastomer material. 
Extension device for living tissue according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said flexible piece is made of at least two separable portions, each corresponding to 

and carrying one of said fastening means (7) at one end of said device, said separable 
portions being unitable by any link means (9). 
Extension device for living tissue according to any one of claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that it comprises a plurality of resilient means (8) made up of 

superposable flexible pieces of different dimensions, of which the largest is placed 
furthest from the surface of said tissue to be treated, the next one in size and position 

being placed against the preceding piece between it and the tissue to be treated, and so 
on until the smallest piece. 
Extension device for living tissue according to any one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that each of said flexible pieces is of varying width and thickness, 

depending on the regions of its surface. 
Extension device for living tissue according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said resilient means (8) is constituted by an envelope (11) made up of two hollow 

cylindrical portions that are open at at least one end and that slide one in the other, any 
appropriate compressible spring system (10) being located therein and tending to 

move said portions apart to a position of maximum separation limited by any 
abutment system. 
Extension device for living tissue according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said resilient means (8) is constituted by an envelope (11) in two semi-closed portions 

sliding one in the other, any appropriate extensible spring system (10) being located 
therein and tending to move said portions towards each other.  

 
Extension device for living tissue according to any one of claims 6 and 7, 
characterized in that it is made up of a plurality of envelopes (11) that are hinged to 

one another about axes (12) enabling the set of theses envelopes (11) to follow the 
natural shape of the living tissue to be treated.
