<ABSTRACT>
An enteral nutritional product for persons infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus contains a soy protein hydrolysate having a molecular 

weight partition, as determined by size exclusion chromatography, wherein 30-60% 
of the particles have a molecular weight in the range of 1500-5000 

Daltons. The nutritional product also contains a source of intact protein. 
The nutritional product has a ratio, by weight, of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids of 

about 1.3:1 to 2.5:1. Enteral nutritional support of a person infected with 
human immunodeficiency virus may be provided by including this enteral 

nutritional product in the infected person's diet. Apoptosis of CD4 cells in 
a person infected with human immunodeficiency virus may be impeded by feeding 

the infected person this enteral nutritional product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a liquid enteral nutritional
product which has been formulated to address the nutritional needs of persons
infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the use of the nutritional
product and the benefits of using the nutritional product.A profound wasting disease in humans associated with Pneumocystiscarinii
pneumonia was first described in the United States in 1981. The
investigation of the symptoms associated with this disease ultimately focused
public health and political structures on a disease described as acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is defined by infection with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and by the onset of several opportunistic
infections, syndromes, and/or malignancies. These include, but are not
limited to, tuberculosis, Pneumocystiscarinii pneumonia, Salmonella
bacteremia, Kaposi's sarcoma, Mycobacteriumaviumintracellulare, herpes
simplex, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), dementia complex, and wasting
syndrome.The cell types infected by HIV play a role in defining the efforts of
the virus on patterns of infection, and ultimately the effect of the disease
on the metabolic and nutritional state of a person infected with HIV. The
immune system develops several types of cells to deal with infection,
including B and T lymphocytes, which produce antibodies and directly attack
the invading pathogen. These cells and others, including macrophages,
monocytes, and other cell types involved in the immune response, communicate
through protein factors which they secrete (cytokines) and/or through the
types of proteins and glycoproteins they display on their surface.Health care professionals dealing with HIV-positive and AIDS patients
face a multitude of management issues, including control of opportunistic
infections and malignancies. Two major factors underlying how a patient may
respond to the therapies required to manage the disease are: (a) the 
nutritional status of the patient early in the infectious process, and (b)
the ability of the patient to take in and tolerate adequate nutrition.The nutritional product according to the present invention for enteral
nutritional support of a person infected with human immunodeficiency virus
is characterized by:
(a) a first source of protein comprising a soy protein hydrolysate
having a molecular weight partition, as determined by size exclusion
chromatography wherein 30-60% of the particles have a molecular weight
in the range of 1500-5000 Daltons;(b) a second source of protein
