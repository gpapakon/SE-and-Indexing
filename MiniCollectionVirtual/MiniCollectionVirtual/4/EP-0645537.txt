<ABSTRACT>
In a liquid ring pump having a port member (50) 
with at least one auxiliary gas discharge port (58a) in 

addition to the main gas discharge port, an auxiliary 
gas discharge conduit (68) is provided to extend the 

auxiliary gas discharge port so that a relatively large 
check valve (78) can be more easily provided for the 

auxiliary port. The auxiliary discharge conduit (68) is 
preferably provided in the head member of the pump, and 

it preferably extends away from the auxiliary port in a 
generally radial direction. This allows the check 

valve to be placed at a less congested location in the 
pump, which facilitates provision of a larger check 

valve and also access to the check valve for such 
purposes as maintenance of the check valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid ring pumps,
and more particularly to check valve structures for the
auxiliary discharge ports that are sometimes provided
in liquid ring pumps.As shown, for example, in Siemen U.S. patent
1,180,613, it is known to provide liquid ring pumps
with multiple, circumferentially spaced gas discharge
ports, the discharge port which is most distant from
the gas inlet port in the direction of rotor rotation
being the main discharge port, and the other discharge
ports being auxiliary discharge ports. It is also
known to associate check valves with the auxiliary
discharge port or ports so that they open automatically
to release gas from the pump when required. When the
pump is not compressing gas to the final discharge
pressure adjacent to an auxiliary port, the check valve
associated with that auxiliary port closes
automatically to prevent gas discharged by the pump
from re-entering the pump via the closed auxiliary
discharge port. Auxiliary discharge ports with check
valves may be used for such purposes as preventing
unduly high gas pressure in the pump during abnormal
operating conditions (e.g., when the pump is first 
started) and/or extending the operating range of the
pump.In most prior liquid ring pumps with
auxiliary discharge ports and check valves, the check
valves are located right at the auxiliary discharge
ports. Thus in Schroder U.S. patent 3,366,314, German
Offenlegungsschrift 2,704,863, British patent
application 2,064,002A, and Japanese patent application
55-5428, for example, the check valve balls or flappers
are located right on the side of the port plate or port
member which is immediately outside the working portion
of the pump. On the other hand, in some "internally
ported" liquid ring pumps the check valves are located
in the interior of the frustoconical or cylindrical
port member that extends into a complementary recess in
an axial end of the pump rotor (see, for example,
Dardelet U.S. patent 2,344,396, Kollsman U.S. patent
2,453,373, British patent 11,378 of 1905, and Japanese
patent application 55-5427).The above-described conventional check valve
locations may be undesirable for any of several
reasons. The working spaces of the pump vented by the
auxiliary discharge ports typically have complicated
shapes such as trapezoids or generally trapezoidal
shapes with one or more curved sides. Even in the case
of internally ported pumps with check valves on the
axial end of the port member rather than inside the
port member, the auxiliary discharge port

<CLAIMS>
A housing of a liquid ring pump (10) with a check
valve, the housing having an aperture for a pump rotor

shaft (40), a first outlet port (58) and a second outlet
port (54), said first outlet port (58) preceding said

second outlet port (54) in the direction (38) in which a
rotor of said pump rotates in use, first (68) and second

(64) conduits respectively communicating with said first
and second outlet ports (58,54) adjacent the rotor shaft

aperture, wherein the check valve (78) is disposed in said
first conduit (68) for allowing gas to flow only in the

direction away from said first outlet port (58), said first
conduit (68) communicating with said second conduit (64)

downstream from said check valve (78), characterised in
that said first conduit (68) extends radially

outside an axial projection of the working
spaces of the pump relative

to said rotor shaft aperture from its communication with
said first outlet port (58) to said check valve (78), said

check valve (78) being located where said first conduit
(68) has a cross sectional area which is substantially

greater than the cross sectional area of first outlet port
(58).
A housing with a check valve according to claim 1
having a third outlet port (56) which precedes said first

outlet port (58) in the direction (38) of rotor rotation, a
third conduit (66) communicating with said third outlet

port (56), and a check valve (76) disposed at a 
predetermined location in said third conduit (66) for

allowing gas to flow only in the direction away from said
third outlet port (56), said third conduit (66) having a

cross sectional area at said predetermined location which
is substantially greater than the cross sectional area of

said third outlet port (56).
A housing with a check valve according to claim 1 or
claim 2 wherein the check valve (76,78) includes a seat

having at least one aperture and a movable valve closure
member, which bears on said seat to close said aperture, and

which moves away from said seat to open said aperture,
wherein the cross sectional area of the aperture is

substantially greater than the cross sectional area of the

respective outlet port (56,58).
A pump having a housing and a check valve according
to any preceding claim and a rotor (30), said rotor (30)

having a hollow interior region which is substantially
concentric with the axis (42) about which said rotor

rotates, and which extends axially into said rotor from at
least one axial end (36) thereof, wherein said first (58)

said second (54) outlet ports extend axially into said
hollow interior region of said rotor (30).
