<ABSTRACT>
In engine fuel control applications in which 
a fuel command is issued to control at least a pair of 

fuel injectors, fuel command compensation is provided 
to stabilise fuel control from injection to injection 

while retaining fuel delivery accuracy. Fuel control 
performance over a control period is modelled and the 

model stabilised through modern control techniques. 
Non-linear compensation is applied to reduce any 

residual fuelling error and both synchronous and 
asynchronous transient compensation are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and
apparatus for controlling the magnitude of a fuel
command periodically issued to control at least one
pair of fuel injectors of an internal combustion
engine.Electronically controlled port fuel
injection is known. An electronic controller
typically issues a commanded injection time and a
commanded injection duration in the form of a timed
fuel pulse to individual fuel injectors each of which
is dedicated to an individual cylinder of the engine.
In conventional sequential port fuel injection, each
injector has a dedicated injector driver controlled by
the electronic controller and the commanded injection
time and duration may be tailored to the individual
needs of each of the cylinders.In conventional alternating simultaneous
double fire injection (ASDF), a single fuel pulse
command is issued to pairs of injectors
simultaneously. In some such ASDF applications, a
single injector driver electrically drives a pair of
injectors and thus provides for fuelling of two
cylinders of the engine. Other known ASDF
applications may not provide for such injector driver
sharing, but may require two fuel commands to be
issued simultaneously, such as in a fallback mode of
fuel control wherein sequential port fuel injection is
at least temporarily not available.For a given ASDF cylinder pair, ASDF control
may make only one determination of the fuel
requirement for the pair in each engine cycle. Then
two fuel pulse commands are issued to the pair per
engine cycle in most engine operating ranges. Half of
the determined fuel requirement is injected at the 
first injection time and the other half at the second
injection time. In steady state operation where the
demand for fuel in the engine is substantially
constant, there is substantially no fuel delivery
error with such conventional ASDF control. However,
ASDF control can introduce significant fuel delivery
error during transient manoeuvres, in which the engine
operating point may change rapidly without proper fuel
command compensation.For example, a commanded pulse width may be
calculated just before the first of two fuel commands
is to be issued to the pair of cylinders in the ASDF
application. The first command properly issues half
of this pulse width to the pair of injectors, but by
the time the second command of the engine cycle is to
be issued, the needs of the engine may have changed to
the extent that the uncompensated second pulse does
not adequately fuel the pair of cylinders. In a
transient manoeuvre in which the engine

A method of controlling the magnitude of
a fuel command periodically issued to control at least

one pair of fuel injectors of an internal combustion
engine, wherein a base fuelling requirement is

determined each time the fuel command is to be issued
to the pair of injectors, comprising the steps of

sensing an engine operating level; determining a
present base fuel requirement over an engine cycle on

the basis of the sensed engine operating level;
developing a fuelling performance model describing the

manner in which past base fuel requirements have been
provided for over a predetermined control period, as a

predetermined function of base fuel requirements and
fuel commands issued over the control period;

determining a present fuel command on the basis of the
developed model; calculating a fuel delivery error as

the difference between the present base fuel
requirement for the engine cycle and the sum of the

present fuel command and a past fuel command;
comparing the magnitude of the fuel delivery error to

an error threshold value; adjusting the present fuel
command so as to reduce the magnitude of the fuel

delivery error to the error threshold value when the
magnitude of the fuel delivery error exceeds the error

threshold value; wherein the adjusted present fuel
command is issued to control at least the one pair of

fuel injectors; and issuing the present fuel command

varied as a predetermined function of a predetermined

engine operating parameter.

the predetermined function is a proportional function 

and the predetermined engine operating parameter is
the present base fuel requirement.
A method according to any preceding
claim, wherein the step of developing a fuelling

performance model develops the model as a sum of
weighted base fuel requirements determined over the

control period and weighted fuel commands issued over
the control period.
A method according to claim 3, wherein
the weights by which the base fuelling requirements

measured engine operating parameters; and adjusting

the present fuel command on the basis of the
determined transient compensation value.
