<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition and a
process for inhibiting dye transfer between fabrics during
washing.
More in particular, the present invention relates to
detergent compositions comprising N-vinylimidazole N-vinylpyrrolidone
copolymers.One of the most persistent and troublesome problems
arising during modern fabric laundering operations is the
tendency of some colored fabrics to release dye into the
laundering solutions. The dye is then transferred onto
other fabrics being washed therewith.One way of overcoming this problem would be to complex or
adsorb the fugitive dyes washed out of dyed fabrics before
they have the opportunity to become attached to other
articles in the wash. Polymers have been used within detergent compositions to
inhibit dye transfer. One type of such polymers are N-vinylimidazole
homo-and copolymers. Examples of said polymers
are described in prior art documents such as DE 2 814 287-A
which relates to detergent compositions comprising 0.1 to 10
wt% water-soluble or water-dispersible N-vinyl imidazole homo-
or copolymer in combination with anionic and/or nonionic
surfactants and other detergent ingredients. EP 372 291
relates to a process for washing discolouration-sensitive
textiles. The wash liquor contains anionic/nonionic
surfactants and watersoluble polymers e.g. (co)polymers N-vinylimidazole,
N-vinyloxazolidone or N-vinylpyrrolidone. EP
327 927 describes a granular detergent additive comprising
water-soluble polymeric compounds based on N-vinylpyrrolidone
and/or N-vinylimidazole and/or N-vinyloxazolidone and cationic
compounds. DE 4027832-A discloses electrolyte-free liquid
detergent compositions comprising zeolite A, nonionic
surfactants and dye transfer inhibiting polymers. The dye
transfer inhibiting polymers are homo-and copolymers selected
from N-vinylpyrrolidone and/or N-vinylimidazole and/or N-vinyloxazolidone.
Tenside Surf. Det. 28 (1991) 6 studies the ability of polymers to prevent
dye transfer and exemplifies detergent compostions comprising N-vinylimidazole-N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymers.It has now been found that the N-vinylimidazole N-vinylpyrrolidone
copolymers are very efficient in eliminating
transfer of solubilized or suspended dyes while enhancing the
detergency performance of specific detergent ingredients
formulated therewith.This finding allows to formulate detergent compositions
which exhibit excellent cleaning and dye transfer inhibiting
properties.According to another embodiment of this invention a process
is also provided for
