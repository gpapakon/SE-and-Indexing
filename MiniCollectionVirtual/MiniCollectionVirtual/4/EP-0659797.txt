<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of manufacturing 
polyesters which comprises an esterifying step wherein a 

dicarboxylic acid and a dihydroxyl compound are esterified 
and the next liquid phase polycondensation step wherein the 

resulting ester is subjected to liquid phase polycondensation 
in the presence of a polycondensation catalyst while a 

distillate which contains an reacted dihydroxyl compound 
and the polycondensation catalyst is distilled, wherein 

the distillate is subjected to a purification treatment 
comprising: 


(a) a distilling step; 
(b) a filtering step; and 
(c) a decoloring step 
 
and then the thus purified distillate is recovered and 

supplied to the esterifying step. A further method 
comprises a purification treatment comprising: 


(a) a distilling step; 
(b) a depolymerizing step; and 
(c) a decoloring step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing polyesters and, more particularly, it relates
to a method of manufacturing polyesters by the
polycondensation of a dicarboxylic acid with a dihydroxyl
compound in the presence of a polycondensation catalyst
wherein the unreacted dihydroxyl compound is recovered
together with the catalyst as a distillate and these
materials are purified and are then practically recycled in
the polycondensation reaction which makes the manufacturing
of the polyesters economical.Polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate
have been widely used for the molding of packaging
containers such as bottles and also in fibers, films or
sheets.Usually, such polyester resins are manufactured via a
step in which a dicarboxylic acid and a dihydroxyl compound
are subjected to esterification and another step in which
the esterified product prepared as such (i.e. a lower level
condensate) is subjected to polycondensation in the liquid
phase in the presence of a polycondensation catalyst. The
thus produced polyester is formed into chips and, usually,
they are further subjected to polycondensation in the solid
phase to increase the intrinsic viscosity whereupon the
product is made available for actual use. In such a method of manufacturing the polyester resin,
the above polycondensation step in the liquid phase is
conducted together with the evaporation of the distillate
which is produced in said polycondensation. The distillate
mostly comprises an unreacted dihydroxyl compound such as
ethylene glycol. In addition, 60-70% of the polycondensation
catalyst used in the above-mentioned polycondensation in
the liquid phase is distilled together with the dihydroxyl
compound and is contained in the distillate as well.Investigations have already been conducted to check the
possibility of the effective utilization of the dihydroxyl
compound and the catalyst for the polycondensation in which
the dihydroxyl compound which is distilled out from the
liquid phase polycondensation and the polycondensation
catalyst are recycled in the polycondensation.However, the distillate which is distilled out from
the liquid phase polycondensation contains large amounts
of impurities such as water, aldehydes and iron due to rust
in addition to the dihydroxyl compound and the polycondensation
catalyst. Accordingly, when such a distillate is
recycled as it is in the polycondensation reaction, the
quality of the resulting polyesters deteriorates.
Consequently, it has been nearly impossible to directly
