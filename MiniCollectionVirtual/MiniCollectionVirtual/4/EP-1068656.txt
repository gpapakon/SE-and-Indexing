<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method are described for exploiting almost the full almost 25THz of bandwidth available in the low-loss window in optical fibers (from 1430nm to 1620nm) using a parallel combination of optical amplifiers. The low-loss window at about 1530nm-1620nm can be amplified using erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). However, due to the inherent absorption of the erbium at shorter wavelengths, EDFAs cannot be used below about 1525nm without a significant degradation in performance. For the low-loss window at approximately 1430-1530nm, amplifiers based on nonlinear polarization in optical fibers can be used effectively. A broadband nonlinear polarization amplifier (NLPA) is disclosed which combines cascaded Raman amplification with parametric amplification or four-wave mixing. In particular, one of the intermediate cascade Raman order wavelengths  lambda r should lie in close proximity to the zero-dispersion wavelengths  lambda 0 of the amplifying fiber. For this intermediate Raman order, spectral broadening will occur due to phase-match with four-wave mixing (if  lambda r 
<
  lambda 0) or phase-matched parametric amplification (if  lambda r 
>
  lambda 0). In further cascaded Raman orders, the gain spectrum will continue to broaden due to the convolution of the gain spectrum with the spectrum from the previous Raman order.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NONLINEAR FIBER AMPLIFIERS USED FOR A 1430-1530nm LOW-LOSS WINDOW IN OPTICAL FIBERSFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to optical amplifiers used in fiber-optics for telecommunications, cable television and other fiber-optics applications. More particularly, the invention relates to an optical fiber amplifier and method for producing an amplified broadband output from an optical signal having a wavelength in the range of 1430-1530nm.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONBecause of the increase in data intensive applications, the demand for bandwidth in communications has been growing tremendously. In response, the installed capacity of telecommunication systems has been increasing by an order of magnitude every three to four years since the mid 1970s. Much of this capacity increase has been supplied by optical fibers that provide a four-order-of-magnitude bandwidth enhancement over twisted-pair copper wires.To exploit the bandwidth of optical fibers, two key technologies have been developed and used in the telecommunication industry: optical amplifiers and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) . Optical amplifiers boost the signal strength and compensate for inherent fiber loss and other splitting and insertion losses. WDM enables different wavelengths of light to carry different signals parallel over the same optical fiber. Although WDM is critical in that it allows utilization of a major fraction of the fiber bandwidth, it would not be cost-effective without optical amplifiers. In particular, a broadband optical amplifier that permits simultaneous amplification of many WDM channels is a key enabler for utilizing the full fiber bandwidth. Silica-based optical fiber has its lowest loss window around 1550nm with approximately 25THz of bandwidth 

 between 1430 and 1620nm. For example, Fig. 1 illustrates the loss profile of a 50km optical fiber. In this wavelength region, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are widely used. However, as indicated in Fig. 2, the absorption band of a EDFA nearly overlaps its the emission band. For 5 wavelengths shorter than about 1525nm, erbium-atoms in typical glasses will absorb more than amplify. To broaden the gain spectra of EDFAs, various dopings have been added. For example, as shown in Fig. 3a, codoping of the silica core with aluminum or phosphorus broadens the emission spectrum considerably. Nevertheless, as depicted in Fig. 3b, the10 absorption peak for the various glasses is still around 153Onm.Hence, broadening the bandwidth of EDFAs to
