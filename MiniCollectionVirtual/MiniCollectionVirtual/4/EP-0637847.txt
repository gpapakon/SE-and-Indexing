formed on a substrate (82) is provided. The electronic switch (80) includes a 

commong transistor collector and diode cathode region (81) of a first 
conductivity type formed in the substrate (82). The switch (80) also includes 

a transistor base region (83) of a second conductivity type formed in a first 
section of the collector region (81) and a transistor emitter region (84) of the 

first conductivity type formed in a section of the base region (80) includes a 
diode anode region (85) formed of the second conductivity type and in a 

second section of the collector region (81). At least a portion of the anode 
region (85) is selectively doped with a metallic dopant to provide centers for 

charge carrier recombination so as to increase the recovery time of the diode 
(D).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transistor switches and in particular 
to the integration of a switching transistor with a reverse current diode as is 
necessary, for example, in applications where inductive loads are to be 
switched. When a diode is formed integrated with a transistor it is convenient to 
form the diode in the semi-conductor material which forms the collector of the 
transistor straightforwardly to provide the required common connection 
therebetween. Unfortunately the characteristics of material chosen to 
provide a good switching transistor do not yield a diode performance that is 
acceptable in all applications. This problem is particularly severe when a 
high voltage, high power switch is considered. An example of an application 
in which the performance of a straightforwardly integrated transistor has 
proved unsatisfactory is in the inverter circuit of a fluorescent lamp. Standard fluorescent lamps are extensively used in industrial and 
commercial environments. Compared to incandescent bulbs, fluorescent 
lamps have lower energy consumption and longer life, but in most domestic 
applications these advantages have been outweighed by the fluorescent's 
fitting size, the need for extra control gear, and the higher initial cost. As a 
result their use has been very selective. Also for applications like task 
lighting, a concentrated light source is needed rather than the distributed 
source given by the conventional fluorescent lamp. For these reasons there is still an enormous market for incandescent 
(filament) bulbs. Recognising the need for a small efficient light source, the  
 
lamp manufacturers developed a range of compact fluorescent lamps. The 
small size is achieved by reducing the glass tube diameter and folding the 
tube one or more times. As with conventional florescent lamps these compact 
fluorescents still required a ballast and a starter. The starter problem was 
solved by building a glow starter into the tube base. Coupling such a 
compact fluorescent tube with ballast mounted in an adapter gave a light 
source which could replace incandescent bulbs. Combining a compact fluorescent with a conventional 50/60 Hz ballast 
gave a light source that was restricted in its application area. In addition to 
higher additional cost with respect to a filament bulb the weight and bulk of 
the ballast made a resultant light source non-retrofitable in many 
incandescent bulb fittings. Physical size, for example, is a factor in 
determining the acceptability of these fittings
