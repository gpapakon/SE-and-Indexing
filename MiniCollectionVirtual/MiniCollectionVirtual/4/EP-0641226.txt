<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of the 
surfaces of materials to prevent or inhibit adsorption of 
protein or reduce thrombogenicity. In blood contacting devices problems can arise from 
thrombogenic reaction at untreated metal, glass or plastic 
surfaces. Such a reaction can lead to platelet adhesion and 
clotting, which can have severe, sometimes disastrous, 
consequences. It is desirable therefore to develop a 
treatment for surfaces which reduces and preferably avoids 
such a reaction. Problems can also arise from non-specific protein 
adsorption at the surface of devices used in many 
applications, such as medical devices. For instance, in many 
modern diagnostic devices, such as many biosensors, a 
specific interaction between an analyte and a detector 
species is relied upon. In such situations non-specific 
protein adsorption can cause a dramatic loss in sensitivity 
or even render the device inoperable. Similarly, where 
bioseparation membranes are used, non-specific protein 
adsorption can cause clogging and thus fouling of the 
membranes. Protein adsorption is also recognised as a problem in 
sight correction devices such as contact lenses. Protein 
build up on such devices leads to a loss in comfort to the 
wearer and a deterioration in vision.  
 Many modern surgical and other medical procedures 
involve the use of blood-contacting devices, such as surgical 
implants, prostheses, catheters, drains and extracorporeal 
circuitry. Such devices are used and then discarded for 
hygiene reasons: such devices must therefore be constructed 
from the most economical materials available, usually 
polymeric plastics or glass. However as already mentioned 
glass and most synthetic and natural polymers tend to induce 
platelet adhesion and activation. Initiation of the clotting 
cascade follows, leading to blockage of tubing and clogging 
of other apparatus such as filtration and dialysis membranes 
and interference with test procedures which, in certain 
cases, may have disastrous consequences for patients. 
Moreover in cases where a device is intended to be implanted 
into a patient and to remain for a prolonged period, such 
platelet aggregation and clotting must be avoided over a 
prolonged period. With existing technology, in order to prevent the 
formation of blood clots during extra-corporeal circulation 
for haemodialysis, long term gas exchange at states of severe 
respiratory failure and cardiac support, e.g. after cardiac  
 
surgery, systemic heparinisation is employed. Owing
