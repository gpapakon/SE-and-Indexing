<ABSTRACT>
A destination website access system employs a bar code reader cooperating with a personal computer or workstation for accessing a unique destination website through a remote Internet service provider (ISP). The address of the unique destination website is embedded within a visibly displayed bar code on a visible medium. In turn, the bar code on the visible medium is scanned and the workstation automatically connects the workstation to the destination website. An intermediary website stores (for further usage) the identities of (i) the workstation; (ii) the visible medium; and/or (iii) the destination website.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESTINATION WEBSITE ACCESS AND INFORMATION GATHERING SYSTEMFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to a system for a computer user to access a destination website, and more particularly to a system for interpreting a printed bar code on a visible medium (e.g. a specific advertisement in a specific newspaper) enabling user access to and communication with the destination website as dictated by the bar code. The present invention is particularly suited for use in conjunction with the extremely large-area network computer accessing system commonly referred to as the "Internet."The present invention facilitates, simultaneously, two important results or functions. First, the computer user is provided a rapid means for receiving information from a specific Internet "website" even though, importantly, the user may not be aware of the website address or URL (Universal Resource Locator). The second important result or function of the present invention is that, in addition to the above-described information supplied to the user, a separate body of information is stored to be available for use by the publisher of the aforesaid visible medium, and/or third parties, such information including (i) the identity of the computer user; (ii) the specific "publication" on which the bar code was imprinted; and (iii) the destination website address (URL).BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The Internet is accessed world-wide by millions of users every day, for both business and pleasure. Internet access provides a user with connections, typically via a local telephone line, to computers and associated databases around the world, thereby promoting a rapid exchange of messages and other information.Internet accessibility is particularly advantageous because of information delivery to users through the use of low-cost connections to other computers through local phone lines, which access heretofore would have been only possible through long-distance telephone connections or through physical 

 transfer of data through, for example, "hard copy" printed material, computer diskettes, or the like.One of the primary advantages of the Internet is rapid world-wide information research and access at the user's "finger tips" regarding virtually any 5 subject. Some examples, among many others, include patent searching, stock and other financial information, newspapers, book reviews, medical research, automobile shopping, movie theater schedules, movie clips, sound clips, and entertainment reviews.A common Internet search
