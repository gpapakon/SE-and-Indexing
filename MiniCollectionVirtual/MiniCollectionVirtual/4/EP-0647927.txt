A device for automatically dispensing items, the 
device comprising item storage means and dispensing 

means, the device including a mechanism for splitting up 
a line of the items, which mechanism comprises ejector 

means (5) travelling around a closed circuit, said 
ejector means acting on each trip round the circuit on 

the item situated at one end of the line of items, the 
device being characterized in that said ejector finger 

(5) comprises a pusher (6) and behind the pusher, a 
roller (10) that projects outwards from the closed 

circuit beyond the top plane of said pusher. 
A device for automatically dispensing items according 
to claim 1, in which the ejector means is an ejector 

finger (5) secured to transmission means forming a closed 
circuit around at least two wheels (8, 8'), said wheels 

being free to rotate about their respective axes, driving 
torque being applied about the axis of one of the wheels 

to drive the transmission means, thereby driving the 
ejector finger (5) around the closed circuit. 
A device for automatically dispensing items according 
to claim 2, in which the transmission means is a looped 

chain (9), and the wheels (8, 8') are toothed wheels. 
A device for automatically dispensing items according 
to claim 2, in which the transmission means is a cog belt 

and each of the wheels is a notched wheel. 
A device for automatically dispensing items according 

to any preceding claim, in which the line of objects is 
placed in a storage column that is adjustable in height, 

width, and depth, and whose base forming the support (4) 
for the line of items is open in its center to allow the 

ejector means (5) to pass therethrough.  
 
A device for automatically dispensing items according 
to any preceding claim, in which two mechanisms for 

splitting up a line of items are interconnected, the two 
ejector means (5) moving synchronously and acting 

simultaneously on two distinct points of the item to be 
ejected. 
A device for automatically dispensing items according 
to any preceding claim, in which said line of items 

extends vertically above said mechanism for splitting up 
the line of items.
